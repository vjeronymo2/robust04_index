			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ren Kan: "Securities Traders Get Information Yardstick"] </F>   [Text] Current and prospective players on the securities  market received a boost yesterday when the China Securities  Regulatory Commission (CSRC) issued regulations concerning the  required formats of interim reports published by listed  companies.    The stipulations aim to present information concerning the  structure, management and performance of the listed companies in  a more standardized format. This should allow investors to  compare listed companies, in terms of an investment risk, more  readily.    Analysts said that the move will also revitalize  international investors' enthusiasm for buying Chinese shares.    Sufficient information will help them better understand  Chinese firms and make right investment decision.    According to the format, the interim report should include a  financial report, review and forecast of business operation,  company's major events, changes of the company's stock  structure, brief introduction of provisional general meeting and  documents for future reference.    The CSRC requires that the board directors of each company  should guarantee the accuracy, truth and fairness of the reports.    The documents should be completed within 60 days after the  end of the first six months of the fiscal year.    The listed companies should submit 10 copies of their  reports  to the CSRC and stock exchanges for record purposes.    These reports will be issued in at least one of the eight  domestic newspapers and magazines which are authorized by CSRC  to issue securities information.    They include, China Daily, Financial News, Economic Daily,  China Securities, Securities Market Weekly, Shanghai Securities  News, Securities Times and China Reform Newspaper.    Chinese companies, which list their shares on both domestic  and overseas exchanges, should issue their interim reports at  the same time to domestic and overseas investors.</p>

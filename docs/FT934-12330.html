			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Chretien vows to untie Canada's rival factions: Conservatives banished to political wilderness MR Jean Chretien, Canada's incoming prime minister, pledged yesterday to work for national unity in the wake of stunning gains by two fledgling and potentially divisive regional parties in Monday's general election. The election transformed Canada's political landscape like no other in its 126-year history. Mr Chretien's Liberal party won a landslide victory, gaining 178 out of 295 seats in the House of Commons. But the strong performance by the two regional parties - the separatist Bloc Quebecois, and the Reform party, whose main strength is in western Canada - could increase strains between English and French-speaking Canadians. Two of Canada's traditional three national parties suffered devastating setbacks at the polls, as voters sought a change from the tough economic times of recent years. One political organiser estimated that at least 40 per cent of the electorate voted for a party which they had never before supported. The Progressive Conservatives, who have held office since 1984, won only two seats in the new parliament, in spite of gaining 16 per cent of the popular vote. The Tory vote was split in many constituencies by Reform, allowing the Liberal candidate to come up the middle. Ms Kim Campbell, who took over as Conservative leader and prime minister four months ago, was defeated in her Vancouver constituency. Under party rules, a new leadership convention must take place within a year. Ms Campbell is not expected to stand for re-election. The BQ, which won 54 seats, will form the official opposition. Mr Lucien Bouchard, its leader, said in his victory speech that 'the Bloc will be positive and responsible in parliament, while vigorously pursuing sovereignty for Quebec'. The Reform party, which opposes official bilingualism and other concessions to Quebec, gained 52 seats, the bulk in Alberta and British Columbia. The left-of-centre New Democratic party held only eight of its 44 seats. Mr Chretien said he understood the frustrations which led voters to support the BQ and Reform. He pledged to 'try to bring us together by appealing not to what divides us, but what unites us'. The Liberals won seats in all 10 provinces. When Ms Campbell took office the public initially warmed to her, but her intelligence and glamour were offset by political inexperience. While Ms Campbell emphasised the painful message of deficit reduction on the campaign stump, the experienced Mr Chretien brought a more reassuring message of job creation. Mr Chretien promised that one of his first acts on taking office would be to cancel a CDollars 5.8bn (Pounds 2.8bn) order for 50 military helicopters built by the UK's Westland Group and Agusta of Italy. The UK-Italian consortium, its local contractors and the Canadian military are lobbying to include the purchase in a wider review of defence policy.

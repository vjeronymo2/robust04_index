			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by Gisela </F> Hopfmueller in Vienna on 4 May]    [Text] [Hopfmueller] The chancellor has been commenting on  the Strasbourg decision outside his office, where he has been  answering journalists' questions. Asked whether he was  surprised by the clear-cut decision, he said:    [Vranitzky] No, I am not surprised. This is an absolutely  pleasant and successful day for Austria and for European policy.  Over the past few days and weeks I have had numerous contacts  with representatives of European Union [EU] states, where I  repeatedly said that the catastrophic warnings that the vote  might fail were unfounded. This result confirms my view very  clearly. We have moved a step forward. This outcome shows very  clearly that not only do we Austrians want to get into the EU,  but the EU is trying to get us as members. This also shows that  the goal of Austrian membership is being taken seriously and is  appreciated beyond Austria's borders. This is a pleasant day  internationally, with apartheid being voted out in South Africa,  with the Gaza-Jericho Agreement being signed today, and now with  this overwhelming majority for Austria's accession to the  European Parliament. This has been a good day for international  understanding and cooperation.    [Hopfmueller] Do you think that today's decision will have  an  effect on Austrian opinion with regard to the forthcoming  referendum?    [Vranitzky] Yes, I think so, because, owing to incorrect  reports from Strasbourg, many commentators and observers have  been doubting lately whether the EU wanted Austria as a member  at all. That we are welcome has become very clear today, and I  think that this is a positive sign for our referendum. But, as  I already said in parliament today, and I can only repeat it:  International events are one thing, and winning over the  Austrian population for this objective is another. This is the  real political task that lies before us. It is also a matter of  putting those in their place who are linking the European issue  with the population's fears and doubts. But in fact, politics  should create trust and credibility; and this task will be taken  very seriously over the next few days and weeks.</p>

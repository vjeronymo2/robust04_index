			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / German hopes of peaceful pay round suffer public sector blow GERMAN government hopes for a peaceful pay round and spending restraint suffered a setback yesterday as employers rejected an arbitration proposal for a 5.4 per cent wage rise for west Germany's 3m public sector workers. Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister responsible for federal and local government wage policy, was joined by private sector employers and other government politicians in a chorus of protest. 'The arbitrators' suggestion fails to take account of current economic conditions and therefore cannot be a basis for agreement,' Mr Seiters said. Mr Hermann-Otto Solms, leader of the Free Democrat parliamentary group, said the offer was not acceptable. It would cost federal and state budgets an additional DM20bn (Pounds 7bn) a year, he claimed. The non-binding proposal, put forward after a seven to six vote in favour, included extra payments totalling DM750 a head. The employers' final offer in the six-day conciliation talks consisted of 5 per cent from April plus DM400 back-pay. 'Anyone who thinks that is too little must go on strike,' said Mr Friedrich Zimmermann, the employer-nominated negotiator. Officials of the OTV and DAG unions, which represent most of the workforce, said they had gone to the limits of their flexibility. If the employers did not improve their offer when formal negotiations resumed on Monday, they would hold strike ballots. The last public sector strike, in 1974, stopped virtually all public services for three days. The overall 'compromise' package for the public sector is lower than the 6.34 per cent steelworkers' award, agreed earlier this year. It is, however, similar to the 5.8 per cent deal offered to bank staff last weekend by employers which enjoyed record profits last year. Engineering employers, currently negotiating with unions pressing for a 9.5 per cent increase for 4m workers, said yesterday that the offer was too high, and could not be read as an indicator of what they could pay. The public sector award, the first agreed in last year's pay round, set the pattern for subsequent negotiations, in which the engineers won a 6.7 per cent basic increase. This year, however, engineering companies have said the increase should be based on expected productivity rises of about 2.5 per cent. West German inflation last month reached 4.7 per cent, and is widely expected to peak at around 5 per cent in June. The last stages of negotiations for the building industry, the strongest sector in the German economy at present, opened in Frankfurt yesterday with unions, demanding 9.8 per cent, faced with a 3.4 per cent offer. In Bavaria, the longest strike in German history ended yesterday as 260 granite quarry workers voted to return to work after a stoppage lasting 301 days.

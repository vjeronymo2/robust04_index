			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Athens hails ruling on Cyprus exports Greek officials claimed yesterday that a ruling by the European Court of Justice amounted to a ban on the import into European Union countries of goods from Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus, Associated Press reports. The court declared that export licences issued by Turkish Cypriot officials were invalid as the EU recognises only the Greek Cypriot government in Nicosia. Its ruling was requested by a British court hearing a dispute over export licences issued by Turkish Cypriot authorities for citrus products and potatoes, most of which end up in Britain. Under the association accord between the EU and Nicosia, the 12 EU states can only accept export documents issued by 'the competent authorities of the Republic of Cyprus' in Nicosia, the court ruled. Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos said the ruling was of great political and economic importance. He said 75-80 per cent of the occupied territory's exports went to Britain.</p>

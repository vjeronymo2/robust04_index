			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;194&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On April 15, 1993, the FAA issued AD 93&hyph;08&hyph;03, Amendment 39&hyph;8550 (58 FR 25549, April 27, 1993), applicable to certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 and &hyph;300 series airplanes, to require inspection to detect cracks of the upper drag strut trunnion fittings of the nose landing gear, inspection to verify tightness of the fitting attachment bolts, and replacement of the fittings or fasteners, if necessary. That action was prompted by reports of cracks detected in two trunnion fittings which retain and support the nose landing gear upper drag link. Studies indicate that these fittings have a low fatigue life. Initial investigations revealed that ground handling caused higher loads than initially predicted, primarily due to towing of the airplane. Cracked trunnion fittings may be further aggravated by loose fasteners (loose nuts, washers, and bolts). The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent failure of the upper drag strut trunnion fittings of the nose landing gear, which could lead to collapse of the nose landing gear. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since issuance of that AD, the manufacturer has designed a modification of the nose landing gear drag link trunnion fittings and fasteners that will significantly improve the fatigue life of these parts and should eliminate the possibility of cracked fittings. De Havilland has issued Service Bulletin S.B. 8&hyph;53&hyph;45, dated July 12, 1993, that describes procedures for installation of Modification 8/1880, which entails replacing both currently-installed upper drag strut trunnion fittings and fasteners of the nose landing gear with new, improved upper drag strut trunnion fittings and new fasteners, and installation of a new sensor bracket. Installation of new fasteners will secure the fittings. The grease nipple in each new fitting is installed at an angle to the horizontal to allow easier access for lubrication. Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, has approved this service bulletin, but it has not classified it as mandatory. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed Modification 8/1880 and has determined that implementation of this modification will positively address the unsafe condition identified as failure of the upper drag strut trunnion fittings of the nose landing gear, which could lead to collapse of the nose landing gear. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would supersede AD 93&hyph;08&hyph;03 to continue to require inspection to detect cracks of the upper drag strut trunnion fittings of the nose landing gear, inspection to verify tightness of the fitting attachment bolts, and replacement of the fittings or fasteners, if necessary. Additionally, the proposed AD would require incorporation of Modification 8/1880. When accomplished, this modification would terminate the need for the currently required inspections. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the proposed AD would limit the applicability of the rule to exclude those airplanes on which Modification 8/1880 has been accomplished previously. The manufacturer has installed Modification 8/1880 on airplanes having serial numbers 385 and subsequent prior to delivery. Airplanes so modified are not subject to the unsafe condition addressed by this proposed AD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 125 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 9 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $1,860 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $294,375, or $2,355 per airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Observer: Job-hunter It is hard to believe we've heard the last of Brenda Dean, Britain's most prominent woman trade unionist. Admittedly, her career as a trade union official is probably over. But she is only 49, is a well-known public figure, and has run a big organisation. Her abrupt departure from the GPMU suggests she doesn't like playing second fiddle. Unlike most of her colleagues she is respected in some Conservative party circles and counts people like Lady Howe among her friends. No doubt she could find a home in an outlying quango. Perhaps Gillian Shephard, the new employment secretary, might find her a job. It would make wonderful PR for the Conservatives.</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Deputy Bank chief warns of rate rises The Bank of England yesterday gave its clearest warning yet that Britain would raise interest rates if sharp price increases by companies threatened to push inflation through the top of its target range. Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, the Bank's deputy governor, entered the debate about whether companies have raised margins excessively. He stressed that conditions of low inflation required different corporate policies, with companies aiming for higher sales rather than higher prices. A month ago, Mr Eddie George, the Bank's governor, sparked controversy when he said more than half of recent increases in manufacturers' output prices came from higher margins. The row was fuelled by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who said a sharp 10 per cent increase in export prices in the past year was a 'vivid reminder' that UK management prefers higher returns rather than higher volumes when competing overseas. Yesterday, Mr Pennant-Rea denied that the Bank was telling managers how to run their businesses. However, he stressed that the government's aim of keeping the 12-month change in the retail prices index, excluding mortgage interest payments, within a range of 1 per cent to 4 per cent - and holding it in the lower half of that range by the end of this parliament - would have a powerful effect on companies' pricing policies. 'We plan to take inflation off the menu,' Mr Pennant-Rea told the City branch of the Institute of Directors. That meant no big monetary boost to pull the economy out of recession, no boom-bust cycle, and avoidance of conditions that produced a big surge in wages. Companies would not be able to raise prices on the assumption that competitors were doing the same, he added. Mr Pennant-Rea said that if companies raised prices beyond the target range, 'we, the policymakers, will raise interest rates. If firms show restraint, aiming for bigger volumes rather than wider margins, then interest rates can be restrained too.' The deputy governor's warnings came against a background of disappointing industrial production figures and official statistics showing only modest inflationary pressures from producer prices. Mr Pennant-Rea said the present low inflation climate opened the way for companies to boost profits through higher volumes rather than prices. The profitability of UK companies was 'pretty robust' and close to that in many other countries. It meant companies would be pricing themselves out of the market if they tried to boost their margins by raising prices. With an inflation target, corporate price decisions had 'huge implications' for the macroeconomic conditions that companies faced, he said. 'We are resolved to achieve overall price stability. Business will benefit hugely from that,' he said. But it would benefit even more if, in advance of that stability 'it begins to think of the long term: of extra volumes and more market share as the road to enduring profitability'. Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Motor industry 'is facing hour of truth' GERMAN car and commercial vehicle production will fall 7 per cent next year as the national economy reaches the low-point of the current downturn, Mr Karl Heinrich Oppenlander, president of the Ifo economics institute, said yesterday. Industrial production will fall 2 per cent, following a 1 per cent drop this year, he said in a speech in Munich. The sectors worst hit this year will show further, albeit smaller, declines. Engineering, heading for a 6 per cent fall in output this year (the industry association forecasts 5 per cent), will see production fall by up to 4 per cent in 1993, Mr Oppenlander said. Textiles would suffer similar falls, while clothing manufacturers, facing a 12 per cent fall this year, can expect a 4 per cent reduction next. Claiming that the motor industry faced 'the hour of truth' as the long-expected downturn came, he added that 'the automobile bosses are prepared'. The industry association recently estimated that the total workforce must be cut by 200,000 in the next few years. Mercedes-Benz has already shed more than 10,000 workers this year. Mr Oppenlander, who forecast a 'slight' economic recovery in the second half of next year, accused the Bundesbank of keeping interest rates high for too long and strangling the economy. However, he expected reductions in leading rates before the end of the year. East Germany's loss-making Eko steel plant on the Polish border is to be rescued with an estimated DM1bn (Pounds 409m) in German and EC public funds to prevent the economic collapse of the region, writes Leslie Colitt in Berlin. The decision was triggered when Krupp, the Ruhr-based steel group, said yesterday it could not uphold an earlier offer to take over Eko because of the depressed state of the European steel market. A Treuhand official said the privatisation agency and the state of Brandenburg would pay DM500m towards the rescue. The other DM500m would come from the Bonn government and the EC. The money would be used for a new electric steelmill and hot rolling mill which Krupp had intended to finance with the Treuhand and Brandenburg. Eko has 4,500 employees and is the main employer in the region.</p>

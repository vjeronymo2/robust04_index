			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> MODEL AGAIN BLAMES GRAF'S KIN  </P> <P> That sex scandal is flaring up again for Peter Graf, the father of West German  tennis star Steffi Graf.  </P> <P> Nicole Meissner, 22, a model known primarily for posing nude, was released from  jail Tuesday and again said that Peter Graf is the father of her child.  </P> <P> Meissner first made the accusation in June but then retracted the statement,  which led to reports that Graf had paid her a large sum of money. West German  authorities arrested Meissner and a boxing promoter, Eberhard Thust, on charges  of attempted blackmail but Meissner was released.  </P> <P> Steffi Graf was so upset about the scandal and media coverage she has  threatened to leave West Germany and move to the United States and also said  her defeat at the French Open in Paris in June was partly due to the scandal.  </P></p>

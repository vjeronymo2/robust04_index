			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (9): Airport makes a winning case - Ease of access is a significant factor in the bid / Communications TOMORROW the board of Manchester airport meets to endorse and submit a formal planning application for its second runway. If the airport wins a public inquiry next year, the runway should open in 1998, allowing the airport to achieve its target capacity of 30m passengers a year by 2005. The issue will not be straightforward, as Liverpool has staked a claim for its airport to become effectively the second runway for north-west England. But the airport, its confidence in the future symbolised in its Pounds 265m second terminal, opened earlier this year, believes the next phase in its expansion would be hard to turn down. If Manchester wins the Games, the ease of access to the city provided by the airport - the 18th biggest in the world in international passengers carried  -is likely to be a significant factor. A new rail link to the city centre and beyond opened last month and the Metrolink supertram system is due to serve the airport by the time the Olympics begin. Sir Gil Thompson, the airport's chief executive, believes that the rail link 'is going to make a significant contribution to the growth of Manchester'. There is talk of a southern spur to connect the airport to the main line rail network at Crewe, and in spite of minimal advertising, the response to the new rail service has been encouraging, with some passengers on the hourly service from Leeds pressing for a check-in facility at Leeds, just as passengers from London Gatwick can check in at London's Victoria station. The link from the airport plugs into a strong railway network, a relic of the industrial revolution. Manchester - which had several railway termini dating from the last century - now has much easier cross-city communications as a result of Metrolink and has been able to develop more through routes. Merseyside, where some Olympic events would be held, has a comprehensive rail system, linked by an underground loop in Liverpool. Manchester's most important innovation has been the Metrolink supertram, which travels on railway lines and on tracks through the city streets. The first two cross-conurbation routes opened last year. The network is being extended to Salford Quays and Trafford Park in the west, and will reach the proposed Olympic sites in east Manchester well before 2000. A station is planned beside the Olympic stadium, and another beside the new velodrome, already under construction. The the north-west's motorway network is crucial to rapid communication between Olympic sites, and between the region and the rest of the UK, The network is almost fully in place, ensuring that Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Chester and Preston are linked directly or with minimal interchanging. The network is based on the M6, the main north-south road artery west of the Pennines, and the the east-west M62 which links the rivers Humber and Mersey and is a fast developing land bridge for European trade. The motorways cross at Warrington, which has become an important distribution node for consumer industries because of its position near the 'time-centre' of Britain. Manchester Airport is 15 minutes from the crossover point and much of its recent growth stems from the fact that 20m people live within two hours' drive. The M62 also links Liverpool and north and west Manchester, and the M6 binds Cheshire and Lancashire together. Regional motorways link Chester and North Wales with Manchester (M56), and Preston with Manchester (M61). Shorter motorways - the M53, M58 and M57 - feed traffic into the network from Wirral, north Liverpool and Bootle respectively, while the M66 joins north-east Lancashire with the M62 and north Manchester. The regional network comprises more than 200 miles and enables the north-west to be traversed in well under an hour, whatever the starting point. Short stretches of motorway are being added to the network continuously, increasing the choice of routes for local travel and limiting the opportunities for congestion. The one serious missing link will be completed within the next five years, joining the M66 and M63 through the eastern suburbs of the Greater Manchester conurbation and giving the city its version of the M25 London orbital motorway. This will comprise the M63 - which arcs round Greater Manchester's western boroughs - and parts of the M66 and M62. Like the bid organisers, the airport claims a strong environmental record, with initiatives on noise control, air pollution, and water pollution. This Sir Gil decribes as 'good commercial practice - an airport can only grow through the willing consent of your neighbours'. Manchester handles more night flights than Heathrow and Gatwick put together, with numbers negotiated through local councils - the airport is owned by 10 local authorities - aided by a computerised noise control system which tracks aircraft to ensure they stay on the least disruptive routes, backed by fines for pilots who break the rules. The airport is run on business lines, with a turnover of more than Pounds 144m last year, and a pre-tax profit of more than Pounds 28m. A healthy margin is needed to help finance expansion. The airport has been a significant contributor to the Olympic bid. The immediate benefits to it of the games would be limited to 100,000 passengers, but the advantages of the higher profile could be significant to an airport which still needs to persuade people booking flights to the UK from abroad that London is not the automatic starting point for every visit to Britain. The bid logo is on prominent display at the airport, and the new terminal has been called the Olympic terminal. Another module is planned to be added to it, in what Sir Gil refers to as 'Toblerone expansion,' to take its capacity to 12-14m passengers a year. Sir Gil hopes that, by the time the Olympics arrive, the UK and US will have sorted out bilateral aviation agreements to allow airlines to fly to more destinations direct from Manchester. Those in the queue include American Airlines, which wants to fly to Miami and Dallas, Delta (Cincinnati, Orlando, New York Kennedy), United (Washington). USAir (Pittsburgh) and Continental (Newark). It is hardly surprising that the airport is a supporter of liberalisation. Anyone in the UK should be able to fly from their own local airport to a destination if there is an airline willing to carry them, says Sir Gil.</p>

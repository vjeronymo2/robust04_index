			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Li Zhiyong (2621 1807 0516) and Miao Fanzu </F> (0416 5379 0586)]    [Text] Lhasa, 7 Feb (XINHUA) -- Surrounded by the highest  mountains in the world, Tibet opens up itself to greet changes  brought about by the market economy. Over the past year,  Tibet's gross regional product reached 3.65 billion yuan, up 8.1  percent over last year and exceeding the average growth rates  over the past 10 years. Financial incomes of localities totaled  149 million yuan, up 37 percent over last year.    Opening up has helped steer vast farms and stock raising  farms in Tibet toward the broad market. Peasants and herdsman  of tens of thousands of households were organized by market  forces. In the past, the state planned allocation and transfer  of grains in southern Tibet to the northern part and cows and  sheep in northern Tibet to the south. Now there are  professional transporters, sellers, and agents who activate  exchanges of agricultural and animal husbandry products between  northern and southern Tibet. If we call the returning of  livestock, land, and pasture to peasant households the first  push to the farming and animal husbandry production in Tibet  since the reform and opening up, then, the further  commercialization of farming and animal husbandry products will  provide a greater motive force to encourage farmers and herdsman  to develop production. Last year is Tibet's sixth of  consecutive harvests of farm produce. Compared to the previous  year, livestock production also increased. Total agricultural  output increased 5.3 percent over the previous year.    Opening up has also brought opportunity and vitality to  Tibet's industries. By conscientiously carrying out the  "Regulations Governing the Change of Operating Mechanisms in  State-Owned Industrial Enterprises" and seriously changing  operating mechanisms, enterprises in the entire region have  fulfilled various economic targets and reduced their deficits.  The transportation sector, a sector vital to Tibet's economy,  had been enduring competition and challenges from all sides.  Last year, the autonomous region decided to lift all  restrictions on transportation enterprises in a bid to steer  them into markets. Under this situation, not one of the 20-odd  state-owned transportation enterprises under the Communications  Department collapsed. On the contrary, they made up deficits  and increased surpluses by a large margin. Even the Gerermu  Transportation Corporation, the only enterprise that operated at  a loss, eliminated losses by more than 200 million yuan.    Opening up has brought a great number of businessmen into  Tibet from the interior of the country, given an impetus to  arousing local people's awareness of commodity, and helped  Tibet's tertiary industry grow rapidly. Opening up has enabled  Tibet, a place used to be backward in foreign trade, to  transform itself into a front of China's foreign trade. Opening  up has made tourism a pillar industry in Tibet, enabled more  people to see Tibet's unique strong points in resources, and  attracted many foreign businessmen. Although the investment  environment was not very good, 27 foreign-funded enterprises  were opened here last year and economic exchanges and  cooperation with the interior were conducted more frequently.  The very effective policy of importing from abroad and  cooperating with units in the interior quickened the process of  transforming Tibet's strong points in resources to economic ones.    Opening up is exerting more and more influence over the  consciousness and concepts of people in Tibet. They realize  that no matter how unique Tibet is, they cannot only depend on  long-term "blood transfusion" nor on maintaining planned or  semiplanned economic structures to get rid of backwardness.  They can only integrate Tibet's market into the vast nationwide  market and double efforts to get rid of backwardness.  Autonomous Regional Chairman Gyaincain Norbu emphatically said:  "In reform and opening up, Tibet must make efforts to develop  in pace and forge a direct link with the nationwide market."</p>

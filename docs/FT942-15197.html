			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Strike] A good hit: An upsurge for tenpin bowling companies Menacing, robotic creatures rush at visitors to Bass's new tenpin bowling centre in Washington, Tyne and Wear. Customers with steady aim can squeeze the trigger and watch the aggressors explode. Those who find this too frightening can take off their virtual reality masks and play a more conventional video game, or have something to eat or drink - or do some tenpin bowling. By adding new activities such as virtual reality games to their traditional offerings, tenpin bowling companies have enjoyed a large upsurge in activity since the mid-1980s, after nearly two decades of declining attendances. In the 1960s, there were over 130 bowling centres in the UK. By the mid-1980s, there were fewer than 50. There are now more than 200. A report by Mintel, the research organisation,published last year, found that 10.4 per cent of the adult population were active tenpin bowlers, against 2.1 per cent in 1985. Over the past year or two, operators say the bowling business has become more difficult as the recession has cut consumer spending and as the novelty of the new electronic games has begun to wear off. Companies such as Bass and First Leisure are, however, continuing to invest in new centres. Mr John Conlan, First Leisure's chief executive, says one of the solutions to the drop in spending is to change the electronic games every few months so that regular customers do not become bored. Mr Conlan, whose company has recently opened new centres in Reading and Maidenhead, believes the solid customer base established by the bowling industry makes it an attractive long-term business. Tenpin bowling itself has not changed much over the past 20 or 30 years. The lanes, the balls and the bowling shoes all look much as they did decades ago. Old-time bowlers will notice some differences, however. They will no longer have to mark the number of pins they knock down on a card; computers will do it for them, showing the score on a screen. Another innovation are rails that can be pulled out at the sides of bowling lanes to prevent balls rolling into the gutters. These are used by novice bowlers and by the children's parties which are an increasingly important part of the bowling centres' business. At some of the new centres, bowlers can tap an order onto a computer keyboard and have fast food or drinks delivered to them while they play. Apart from electronic games, some of the centres have pool tables. At First Leisure's new Maidenhead centre, customers can wander through rooms decorated to resemble the medieval past or the high-technology future, playing games based on the Channel 4 programme the Crystal Maze. Only about 50 per cent of a bowling centre's turnover now comes from bowling, according to Mr Adam Fowle, managing director of Bass Leisure Entertainments. The rest comes from food, drink and the other activities. The success of bowling centres since the 1980s has resulted from the leisure companies' strategy of turning them into places people go for an evening out, rather than for a single activity, he adds. Many of the new bowling centres are next to shopping malls. Bass's Washington bowling centre has one of the company's bingo halls next to it. First Leisure's Reading bowling centre is next door to one of its discotheques. Many of the discotheque customer drop into the bowling centre for a drink. Mr Fowle says research carried out by his group indicates that, to attract people to bowling centres or other leisure facilities, companies have to offer their customers security against crime. It is not their personal safety people are worried about; it is the fear of what might happen to their cars while they are bowling, drinking or eating. The Washington centre car park is surrounded by fearsome looking spiked railings. It is well-lit and watched by cameras and security guards. Mr Fowle says: 'It's a question of getting into the minds of people that this is not a place to steal cars. The police say that, if you establish this straight away, it doesn't develop into a problem.' Mr Fowle says there are few security problems inside bowling centres. Security guards and cameras play their part. But he says more important is the presence of families and children, which acts as a deterrent to aggression despite the free availability of alcohol. Mr Fowle says 80 per cent of his group's bowling customers are under 35 and from an ABC1 background. On average, they spend Pounds 15 a head per visit to the bowling centre. Other bowling groups regard this figure as high. They say Pounds 5 a head is more typical and argue that bowling appeals to a wide cross-section of people: competitive bowlers, families with children and teenagers. Mr Roger Mavity, chief executive of the leisure division of Grenada, which has 24 bowling centres, says: 'Increasingly, the ABC categories are not relevant to these kinds of activities. Most teenagers have a level of disposable income that would have been impossible to imagine if you turned the clock back a generation.' Bowling's appeal is helping to return the industry to growth again, he says. But he cautions: 'Trying to look too far ahead in leisure is difficult. Tastes can change faster than five-year plans allow for.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs in an  interview on Thursday [24 February] that at present there are no  international guarantees for Latvia's security if an agreement  is concluded on the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia by  31 August. Andrejevs explained that Latvia can only rely on the  gentlemanly behavior of the countries and organizations that  have given advice in supporting Latvia if, as a result of  concluding the agreement, Latvia's security is somehow  threatened.    Andrejevs added that at present even the governing coalition  is not fully unanimous as to whether such an agreement would be  profitable to Latvia. Therefore the discussion on this theme is  still continuing. Besides, Latvia will not conclude the  agreement if Russia does not back down on the issue of the  social provision for Russian military pensioners, added  Andrejevs.    Speaking of the decision of the Russian State Duma on  amnesty  for participants in the unrest of 1991, Andrejevs emphasized  that this question is an internal Russian problem. But in the  longer term, it could strengthen the hand of the extreme radical  and conservative wings in Russia, which would not be favorable  to Latvia. Thus the potential danger grows, added Andrejevs.  Besides, such a resolution also shows the balance of power in  the Russian State Duma.</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / US troops for Rwandan capital The US will send troops into Rwanda to help boost emergency relief efforts at the airport in the capital, Kigali. Pentagon officials said yesterday that up to 200 troops would go to Kigali, but stressed they would be on a humanitarian, rather than peacekeeping mission. At least 4,000 US troops are already being sent to Zaire and Uganda to help deliver food, water and other supplies to more than 1m Rwandan refugees who fled their homeland as rebels won a bloody civil war. In another move to step up help, President Clinton yesterday asked Congress to approve Dollars 320m of extra aid. Meanwhile, a top United Nations aid official, Mr Peter Hansen, predicted Rwanda could see yet another 'world record' refugee exodus when French troops pull out of their south-western security zone next month. About 1.6m Rwandan Hutus have taken refuge in the safe area set up by France, which says it will withdraw its 2,500 troops by the time its UN mandate expires on August 22. The first French troops left yesterday.</p>

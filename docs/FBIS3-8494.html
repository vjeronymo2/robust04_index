			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Milos Zeman, chairman of the Czech Social </F> Democratic Party, by Ivo Slavik and Marek Stonnis; place and  date not given: "CSSD Wants To Be Vigorous Rather Than Obedient  Opposition"]    [Text] [LIDOVE NOVINY] How should the policy of the Czech  Social Democratic Party [CSSD] look? We ask because your  personal political practice substantially differs not only from  Polish social democracy and Weiss's Slovak Party of the  Democratic Left, but also from the conduct of the CSSD Deputies'  Club in parliament.    [Zeman] First of all, I start with the assumption that Czech  social democracy has, as opposed to Poland or Slovakia, where it  was not very strong between the wars, a certain tradition that  must be respected but not blindly followed. There was a 40-year  suspension here, while the West European social democracies  progressed. We are approaching the Western political culture  only very slowly, and sometimes the communist way of thinking  prevails within us. [German Social Democratic Party (SPD)  leader] Rudolf Scharping, for instance, in a televised  discussion, described [German Chancellor] Helmut Kohl as an  overgrown infant with cottage cheese on his brain, and the  German voter takes it as something completely normal. If I used  the same expression, I would be marked as a cryptocommunist, at  least.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] After all, the SPD is shaped differently,  and its supporters are not pining for communist "security."  Moreover, the alternative you offer is very vague and rather  confrontational toward the hitherto changes....    [Zeman] I do not believe it is vague. It is based on the  idea of solidarity. There are three maxims in the West European  concept: freedom, justice, and solidarity. Every political  party, even those that do not really mean it, will tell you  today that it advocates freedom. Solidarity is the idea that  society should take care of the people who will reach the state  of not only social, but also human need. The entire problem  rests in the fact that solidarity cannot be just a passive  protectionism. We must seek an active policy aimed at the  creation of new jobs, the development of the education and  health-care systems.... If you set yourself this goal, the  question immediately emerges of how to finance it. No program  can be complete without answering this question. The difference  between social democracy and, say, the Civic Democratic Party  [ODS] is quite obvious on this point.    Just as we do not say that ecology is only the icing on the  cake, we do not claim that the market will solve everything. We  want society to have a long-term concept. We need industrial  policy, structural policy, exports-enhancing policy, transport,  and energy policies. If the government economists occasionally  tell us that they do not need it because the market will solve  everything, we disagree because we know that it all exists in  the advanced economies. We did not make it up.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] Nonetheless, the need for a long-term  positive perception was also expressed recently by a cofounder  of the ODS, Miroslav Macek, in RUDE PRAVO. Likewise, in the  right-wing parties, there are, if not trends, then individuals,  who perceive certain things in a broader context. In comparison  with them, your approach to politics does not belong to the most  fortunate ones, particularly, as the public trust in the  government is high, and social or economic tremors are not  expected.    [Zeman] We certainly do not wish for any social or economic  tremors. It is irrelevant, however, what we wish. What is and  what is not a realistic possibility is important. Yes, the  government has the trust of the majority at this time.  Although, if you browse through public opinion surveys, you  will see that the trust has declined over the past three months.  Let us ask, however, whether we are to respond only to the  problems that are topical at a given time or also to those that  will emerge in the foreseeable future. We have practically no  unemployment, or it is very low, but it is becoming a regional  phenomenon. While the government economists interpret the low  unemployment as something favorable, we claim that it is, in  effect, overemployment caused by the stagnation of industry  restructuring. At the same time, industrial production is  dropping. Another question is linked to the creation of  regional development programs--in Ostrava region, for instance.  Phasing down programs are occasionally mentioned, but almost no  one will say what substitute to offer for the original jobs.  That is, if we disregard the various plans for reforestation,  grassing over, etc., which are about as realistic as Baudys's  plan for a peaceful settlement of the situation in Bosnia.    We simply lack a combination of the market and extra- or  supra-market mechanisms. That is where I see a specific  difference. I read the interview with Mr. Macek. His long-term  vision is reminiscent of Khrushchev's Communist Party program:  Already this very generation will live in communism. I am  repelled by all political parties without exception, which claim  that theirs is the only acceptable way. If they offer a bright  future and shining tomorrows, I do not care whether the shining  tomorrows are communist or market because, in both instances, it  is just an illusion.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] Nevertheless, people trust the ODS and Civic  Democratic Alliance [ODA], and it is, above all, the young and  the better educated who believe in them. Does it not prove  something?    [Zeman] I believe that it is given by several factors. Of  course, the declining social economic situation hit the  pensioners the hardest.    I would say that a certain ebb will ensue. Of course, some  young dissatisfied people are attracted by the  republicans--precisely by their radicalism. They have simple,  understandable answers. Social democracy does not know simple  answers. It does not know slogans of the type "the market will  solve everything."    [LIDOVE NOVINY] Certainly, but we are more interested in  the reason for the small number of younger supporters of the  CSSD....    [Zeman] Every generation must pass through political  puberty. At the beginning of the 1950's, many intelligent young  people trusted the communist ideology. Of course, we have not  admitted it even to ourselves, and we pretend we were a nation  that maintained an anticommunist resistance for 40 years. Well,  and now, suddenly, because communism was of course abhorrent, it  is only a natural reaction to say that the more the obvious  opposite of communism is established, the better for us. I  believe that Zhirinovskiy in Russia indicates to us that there  is some nonlinear dependence. Extremes meet in a particular  manner. The extreme left and the extreme right are often hard  to distinguish.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] Neither the ODS nor the ODA can be  considered the extreme right. Moreover, the people have the  opportunity today to compare the communist and the West European  models of society according to their own experience.    [Zeman] The possibility of a comparison is not given by a  trip to the West lasting several days. In a superficial,  short-term view, you often realize the actual problems just as  little as the Western tourists perceive ours. Anyway, that is  not the issue.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] Nevertheless, it was precisely the CSSD  supporters, together with Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia  [KSCM] supporters, who most frequently named [Association for  the Republic-Republican Party of Czechoslovakia chairman]  Miroslav Sladek in public opinion surveys as the  second-most-acceptable alternative.    [Zeman] If you want to support your argument by public  opinion polls, I must point out that, to the question of which  is the second-most-attractive party, the ODS supporters replied  that the ODA is, while the ODA supporters named the social  democracy. I do not wish to draw any definite conclusions from  it, but I rather tend to believe that the support by the  younger-age groups for political extremes is caused by a certain  impasse, desperate situation. There are also numerous  privatization and corruption problems.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] Your party claimed that it would  consistently determine and disclose corruption affairs, and  nothing much has happened....    [Zeman] A lack of information is not an argument. We have  published, for instance, the Aero Holding affair. We proposed  that an investigation commission be established. The government  deputies rejected this proposal. I ask, why? We published the  Plzen breweries affair. I am not accusing you of violating  Article 102, but, even as we speak, you are at variance with the  claim made by Interior Minister Jan Ruml, who publicly declared  that the social democracy is responsible for the Wallis affair.  Of course, I do not claim that we are. I only say that  Minister Ruml believes it.    At the time of the Hradec congress, we were assured by the  former leadership that we are the wealthiest party, so we  assumed that investigation teams composed of lawyers,  journalists, and economists would be established. When we  learned that we are not able to finance these teams--which we,  of course, learned only after the congress--it slowed us down  but did not change our attitude.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] You said that some parties offer simple  solutions. Would you not say that your statement "we are after  the government's throat" qualifies for such a denotation?    [Zeman] A statement of the "we are after the government's  throat" type is used in the West by opposition politicians on a  daily basis in an infinite number of variations. I can  understand that, in a country nursed on the communist political  culture, such a statement seems rather out of place.  Nevertheless, let us not be hypocrites. If we keep saying that  we want to get closer to the Western political culture, we must  understand that a certain, albeit rough, exchange of invectives  between the government and the opposition is an organic part of  it. I attended a conference of the British Labour Party in  Brighton recently. There, [Labour Party Leader] John Smith  recommended that the British Conservative Party replace [British  Prime Minister] John Major with the winner of the last Liverpool  [Grand National] steeplechase--i.e., by a horse. As you might  have observed, I have not suggested that Vaclav Klaus be  replaced by Zeleznik [Pardubice steeplechase winner]. Hence, I  am somewhat more moderate. During the U.S. presidential  campaign, George Bush said that his dog Millie understands  foreign policy better than Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton, as  opposed to Mr. Hruska [district police chief who sued Zeman for  comments on his education], did not sue George Bush for damages  of $100,000. We may dislike it. Let us ask why we dislike it.  Whether it is not just that we are used to an opposition of the  National-Front type, but, then, the National Front has never  been an opposition.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] You claim that your party does not offer  simple solutions. It seems, however, that your bon mot  attracted more supporters to the CSSD than its complex program.    [Zeman] The fact that we are not able to offer simple  solutions and that a positive program, of course, is more  complex and continues to develop does not mean that we would not  use, like any opposition party in the West, also formulations  that will point out to the voters that we are a vigorous and  aggressive rather than an obedient opposition. After all, you  have an example in the parliament of a constructive and  accommodating opposition. It is Hirs's liberal, social,  national, and who-knows-what party. I do not have the feeling  that the Czech political scene can in any way benefit from such  an accommodating opposition. An opposition that is not  attacking and trying to replace the ruling party in the next  elections is not an opposition. It is only a certain  modification of that well-behaving National Front type of party.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] The claim that coupon privatization is a  fraud belongs to the simple slogans. Nevertheless, several  hundred thousand more people have registered for the second wave  of registration than did for the first wave, and some investors  made a nice profit. Would you not say that your conjecture is  rather controversial?    [Zeman] The enterprises privatized by the coupon  privatization methods have two possibilities: The first, less  common, has most capital shared by small investors. You will  see that, in such an instance, the management virtually cannot  be recalled. The other possibility, and one that occurs more  frequently, has most of the share capital owned by privatization  funds. The privatization fund is, however, a stockholding  company in its own right. It has small shareholders  exclusively. Thus, the management of these stockholding  companies called privatization funds cannot be recalled, either.  At the same time, one of the basic principles of the market  economy is the right of the owner for an efficient control of  the management. Our enterprises are de facto owned by the  managers. I do not question their talents or efficiency but,  rather, point out that, because of links from the past era, many  of these managers are people who were brought up under the  former regime and who, under the present system, when no  sufficient legislative barriers exist, can have the tendency to  bring the enterprise to bankruptcy, start their own company, and  operate it at the cost of the quasi-privatized enterprise. They  can also reach an agreement with a foreign capital company that  does not always come to this country with such good intentions  as to bring in the know-how and new technology and utilize the  advantage of cheap labor but can be, instead, interested in  eliminating a local manufacturer to open the Czech market for  its own products. I am not claiming that it always is the case.  I would wrong our managers--and I respect many of them. I do  claim, however, that it can happen and that it is actually  happening already in a marginal number of cases. That is my  principal objection to coupon privatization. Yes, let us say  that the Harvard Funds or any other fund will pay more for a  share than its symbolic book value is. I say--and what? We all  live and are going to live in this country. We all are going to  depend on the output of our economy--i.e., on the output of the  industrial enterprises. If we opted for a privatization method  that reduces this output, we will all have to pay for it and  will notice it in the lower standard of living, in our real  income, and also in what is called the quality of life.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] Some time ago, you said that there is no  discrepancy between your annual report and the analysis by Mr.  Novotny. So, why such a long discussion about something that is  not controversial, and why did the Central Executive Committee  members receive only the first part of Novotny's material and  not the whole thing?    [Zeman] One has to realize that material regarding electoral  preferences was discussed by the presidium approximately one  month after it was received. So, you cannot say that the  reaction was belated. This is the part that was put at the  disposal of the Central Executive Committee. Regarding the  second part, I believe that the discussion should continue. We  are seeking ways to make us a more efficient opposition rather  than an obedient one. I do not like parties that claim their  congress to be the most important event of the year in domestic  politics if they state, at the same time, that nothing  significant happened at this congress. Every live party should  contemplate its mistakes because its eventual successes are  brought about by the voters, and, therefore, they do not have to  think about the successes. We are perceived as an alternative  to the current government policy, and if it is to be viable, it  must be continuously cultivated. I pity the parties that do not  do it.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] On the outside, the CSSD seems to be a party  full of controversial and contradicting analyses, materials, and  reports.    [Zeman] You are starting from two unmentioned assumptions.  First, a party, in which there are no discussions and possible  alternatives of development or hypotheses are not compared is a  better party than one in which discussions are taking place.  Second, you believe that, if the deputies' club of a party is  assessed in at least two different ways, the party must be worse  than one that has a unified opinion in its deputies' club. Both  of these assumptions, which you did not mention but are valid,  nonetheless, can be questioned. In the Middle East war, only  two types of missiles were used. Unguided ones, which could not  correct their course during flight--i.e., the Scud missiles.  They mostly fell down in the desert and caused only minor  damage. The guided, self-correcting antimissile Patriot  missiles mostly hit their targets precisely because of the  self-correcting feature. The social democrats are trying to be  like these guided missiles. That means a missile that corrects  its course in flight. We consider the politics of the ruling  parties, particularly the ODS, which are often intoxicated by  what Fulbright called the arrogance of power, an uncorrected  course. So, ask yourself what is more expedient. Is it not to  contemplate the possibilities and talk, make a decision, and go  on? I myself asked that we take stock of our situation after  one year. We could have kept saying how successful and great we  are, how the nation admires us, and then come to the Ostrava ice  arena [as Klaus did] and learn the opposite.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] God forbid that we would think that a  party in which there are no discussions, or only one person  discusses the issues, is better than a party in which  discussions take place. The opposite is true. It seems on the  outside, however, that there is not much willingness for  discussion in your party....    [Zeman] Two or three months do not solve the problem.  Nonetheless, I can say that there is a proposal in my report to  the Central Executive Committee that our Central Committee,  which has held a 120-member-body meeting for one day every two  or three months so far be divided into specific working sections  that will deal with certain problem areas. The Central  Committee working sections should identify the questions that  are felt to be the most burning problems. I completely agree  with Ota Novotny on this count, and that is also how I  understand his proposal.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] You spoke about those simplifying slogans.  We believe that your report was a simplifying one. We are  referring to the part in which you demagogically spoke about our  right wing as having fascist tendencies....    [Zeman] Jiri Vcelar Kotas, who has been explaining to us in  this country for a long time what an authentic right wing is,  said once that the more right it is the better. That is on the  record. I polemicize with this statement because, just as the  left wing per se is nothing harmful, while in its extreme  form--i.e., the communist form--it certainly is harmful, so  there is nothing harmful on the conservative right wing.  However, as soon as it reaches the extreme forms--if the space  for the application of democratic institutions is reduced, the  powers of the Supreme Control Office limited, and if, after the  abolition of the Prosecutor General's Office, we transfer to the  state attorney system, one of the self-correcting mechanisms is  weakened--an intermediate stage ensues. Let us call the first  stage an authoritarian one. It is happening again that the  posts in the state apparatus are filled according to the party  membership and not according to the qualifications. I could  name other forms of nondemocratic tendencies. The proof by  contradiction means that you try to simulate what happens as you  reach the end of this process. Even if the end is very remote.  My report says: fascist tendencies in their extremes. That is  a common form of expression when you are trying to say how  bitter the ends would be precisely because you want to prevent  their actually taking place. You try to point out that you have  set off on an avalanche slope, for instance, and want to go  somewhere else. You are glad when the avalanche does not occur.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] Of course, Mr. Kotas does not represent our  right wing. He is more of a tragicomic figure....    [Zeman] Our right wing is Mr. Kotas. It was Mr. Kotas who  said that the more right, the better. I repeat that this  statement is complete nonsense. Mr. Kotas declared himself a  right-winger, and, in his time, he was known to a nonnegligible  part of the public as a representative of the right wing. I  must respect this fact.</p>

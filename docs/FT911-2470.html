			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Bonds: Slow business wipes out swap opportunities BUSINESS in both thesecondary and primary markets was subdued yesterday. Eurodollar bond prices lagged price gains in a firmer US Treasury market, causing spreads to widen a little. Consequently, the swap opportunities which prompted a spate of short-dated issuance last week have now disappeared. Nevertheless, Credit Local,the French financial institution, was able to add a further Dollars 150m to its Dollars 200m three-year deal launched last Tuesday. A Credit Local official said the proceedsfrom the extra Dollars 150m, swapped into floating-rate dollars, would be used to refinance an outstanding issue of medium-term notes. After a slow start last week, the spread on the Credit Local deal expanded from a launch level of 47 basis points to more than 50 basis points over the comparable Treasury. The wider spread brought in buyers and the deal then sold quickly, benefiting from its top credit rating, and from being launched ahead of three other short-dated deals brought last week. The new tranche was launched at a 52 basis point spread. In the lira market, a unit of Volkswagen raised L150bn of four-year bonds, via Banca Commerciale Italiana. The bonds are expected to be placed mainly with German investors, both institutional and retail. Although Volkswagen is unrated, it is considered a top credit by German investors in particular. The deal was quoted at 100.3,  1/8 point with full fees of 1 5/8 points. The proceeds of the issue were swapped into floating-rate dollars. Few new issues are expected to be launched this week, with Japan shut for Golden Week and most of Europe closing down on Wednesday for May Day. Staatsbank, the former East German central bank, raised a further DM4bn in equal two- and five-year tranches. The notes pay interest at the three-month Frankfurt interbank offered rate. The lead manager is Bayerische Vereinsbank, with an international syndicate. Both tranches were quoted within full fees.</p>

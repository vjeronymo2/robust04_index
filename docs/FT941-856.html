			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Emerging Markets: Nervous week for sterling and dollar - Currency Markets Dollar and sterling investors will this week be watching foreign exchanges nervously following volatile trading at the end of last week. Both currencies fell through key support levels, with the dollar reaching a low of DM1.6595 in London on Friday and sterling touching DM2.4880. The trading week will be truncated with most markets closed on Good Friday. A key exception is in the US where the Bureau of Labour Statistics has resisted high-level representations and is pressing ahead with the release of key labour market data on the day. March non-farm payrolls and hourly earnings figures will be closely watched for evidence of inflation. There is some doubt, though, whether they can have much effect on the dollar's fortunes. Mr Gerald Holtham, chief international economist at Lehman Brothers, notes: 'The problem with the dollar is that all plausible increases in Fed funds are already priced in'. On Friday, the December eurodollar contract on Liffe settled at 94.78, discounting three month rates of 5.22 per cent at the end of year. This compares with dollar three month currently trading at 3.78/3.90 per cent. In the UK, attention will focus on Wednesday's monthly monetary policy meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England governor. Hopes of an interest rate cut, however, have receded following a worse than expected February retail price inflation number; the weakness of sterling and considerable pessimism about the interest rate outlook, reflected in the short sterling futures market where prices fell sharply on Friday. Most analysts believe the market has overreacted and that another 25 basis points cut in the base rate, to 5.25 per cent, is possible. The timing of a possible cut looks likely, however, to be delayed into the summer. Any cut in the current climate runs the risk of undermining sterling and the gilts market even further. The outcome of the Italian elections, expected on Tuesday, is another important event. The market appears to favour a strong, preferably centre-left, government. A strong showing from the fascists in the south, however, could unsettle markets and push the lira below L1,000. The French franc is also in the spot-light. Concerns about whether monetary policy is not too tight, high unemployment and rioting in the streets have led some observers to predict that the French currency could slip as low as FFr3.48 to the D-Mark.</p>

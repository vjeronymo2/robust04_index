			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ihar Sinyakevich: "Belarusian Pipelines Could Be </F> Sold to Russia for the Price of One House?"]    [Text] The Belarusian Government forwarded an agreement on  joining the Russian Joint Stock Association "GAZPROM" by the  Belarusian state enterprise for gas delivery "BELTRANSHAZ" for  ratification by the Belarusian Supreme Soviet. According to the  agreement that was signed by Belarusian and Russian prime  ministers on 8 September 1993, along with the agreement on the  unification of their monetary systems, Belarus receives  valuables of the "BELTRANSHAZ," the entire property of which is  handed over to the statute capital of the Russian Joint Stock  Association "GAZPROM." The cost of the "BELTRANSHAZ" property  was assessed at 1.2 billion rubles [R] as of 1 January 1993.  Land belonging to the Belarusian gas industry is being leased  to Russian "GAZPROM" for 99 years. The agreement also states:  "The Republic of Belarus guarantees that the property -- which  is being handed over to Russia on the basis of the agreement --  and "GAZPROM" investments on the territory of Belarus will not  undergo confiscation, nationalization, or requisition. The  Republic of Belarus guarantees free transit of Russian natural  gas for export."    On the other hand, Russia promises to support "GAZPROM" by  increasing its yearly gas deliveries to Belarusian consumers up  to 21 billion cubic meters in 1995, 26 billion cubic meters in  2000, and 33 billion cubic meters in 2010.    The government's note ratifying this agreement enumerates  the  following advantages, which certify the necessity for its  ratification: Belarus will be guaranteed gas deliveries in the  amounts required for the national economy; the issues of  supplying the Belarusian gas industry with spares, pipes,  insulation and operational materials will be resolved; in  connection with the increased transit of gas deliveries through  the Belarusian territory, the state budget of Belarus will  receive more assets; Belarus will enjoy dividends from the  activities of "GAZPROM"; the Belarusian construction branch will  receive orders for $300 million.    However, not all were satisfied with the arguments of the  government. The Supreme Soviet commission for economic reform  opposed the ratification of this document and demanded  additional information on the conditions of this deal. This is  what People's Deputy Leanid Kozik, chairman of the commission,  said: "I oppose the ratification of this agreement. This is my  and our commission's opinion. We do not see anything beneficial  from this agreement: Neither what the costs of the main  "BELTRANSHAZ" funds are, nor how many securities the Belarusian  party will receive. According to the figures cited in the  press, I calculated that Belarus will have 0.5 percent. The  cost of Belarusian gas pipelines and pumping stations were  assessed at R1.2 billion. I calculated that the cost of the  metal for these pipelines alone is much higher. I wrote a  resolution that as long as we have no exact figures, and as long  as I do not see what this means for the Republic, I am not going  to initial this document."    Could you propose any alternative to cooperation between the  "BELTRANSHAZ" and the "GAZPROM?"    "In principle, I am not against the setting up of a joint  stock company. However, the documents should be properly  formulated, so that one party would not take everything away  from the other. Because after joining the joint stock company,  we will have only securities while the property will belong to  the other party. According to the Russian and Belarusian laws on  joint stock companies, in case of withdrawing from a joint stock  company, we cannot claim back our property, it will be possible  to sell only the securities. I do not oppose the joint stock  companies, but it is necessary to properly assess the property  and the expenses of the Republic, because later, Russia will  continue exporting its gas to the West, however, free of charge.    Poland chose to set up a joint stock company with the  "GAZPROM...."    "There could be other variants if the property belongs to  us.  The main aim is that Belarus does not lose."    What do you think? Will the legislature ratify this  agreement?    "I will categorically oppose it. I do not think that  deputies will believe this note without seeing the figures, and  will distribute our property without any reasons for doing this."    Other deputies also spoke about their negative attitude  toward this agreement. The issue is not only that of the low  costs of the "BELTRANSHAZ." According to some assessments, if  we sell the state property based on its balance costs, then one  U.S. billionaire could buy all the property of the Republic of  Belarus. It is not worth selling such strategic objects as  pipelines at their real, market price because the Republic will  lose not only its property forever, but its opportunity to  affect Russia through the market. It is a very dangerous step if  we take into consideration that Belarus depends on Russia in  many aspects.</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Inflation and average earnings unchanged Two important measures of price pressure were unchanged yesterday, providing good economic news for the government. The annual rate of headline inflation in June was 2.6 per cent, the same as in May, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday. But underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments, fell to 2.4 per cent from 2.5 per cent in May. Average earnings across the economy rose at an underlying rate of 3.75 per cent in May, the same as in April, the Department of Employment said. A complex set of factors left the retail prices index unchanged in June. Price rises included 2p per pint on draught bitter, and there were some increases in bus and rail fares. Seasonal food prices, which rose sharply in May, failed to fall as much as expected in June - a month-on-month fall of 0.5 per cent compared with a 4.6 per cent fall in June last year. Onions, cauliflowers and cucumbers all saw higher prices. Retailers' summer sales have started later and have yet to see such sharp price cuts as last year. Nevertheless, the sales still put downward pressure on the RPI, as did cuts in the prices of personal articles, such as umbrellas, spectacle frames and clocks. The annual growth in prices of non-seasonal food remained very low. Second-hand car prices fell about 0.4 per cent, the first time they had declined in June since 1982. The effect was to offset a rise of 1p a gallon in the cost of four-star petrol and to leave motoring costs unchanged between May and June. The newspaper price wars have yet to have an effect on the index. The CSO said the cuts in the cover prices of The Times and The Daily Telegraph newspapers would knock about 0.03 per cent off the all-items index in July. Price reductions from the summer sales should also continue in July, and further falls in seasonal food prices are likely. The RPI has fallen in July in each of the past three years. The standstill in the annual growth rate of annual earnings was welcomed by the markets, which became concerned about the steady rise in this measure in the early months of this year. The annual rate peaked in March, when City bonuses pushed the rate up to 4 per cent. The seasonally adjusted index - which does not smooth out the statistical series to account for any temporary influences - rose on the month, with an annual growth rate of 4.3 per cent in May, compared with 3.6 per cent in April. The lowest underlying rate of growth occurred in the services sector, where wages grew 3.5 per cent - the same as the month before. Earnings in the manufacturing and production sectors grew 4.25 per cent, slightly down from the previous month. The underlying figure was in line with City expectations, and analysts yesterday welcomed it as evidence that the recent industrial pick-up and fall in unemployment had not yet fed through to significantly higher wage demands. They warned, however, that more settlements were in the pipeline which might fuel a slight rise later this summer. A wage settlement for the Agricultural Services Board next month, for example, has been set at 4.9 per cent compared with 2.7 per cent last year, the employment department said. A settlement for civil engineering has been agreed at 2.4 per cent compared with no increase last year. Growth in the manufacturing sector's unit wage costs remained low - 1.7 per cent higher in the three months to May than in the same period a year ago. Manufacturing output per head rose 2.9 per cent over the same period.</p>

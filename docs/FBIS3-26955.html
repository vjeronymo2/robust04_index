Comrade Deng Xiaoping  said: "A special economic zone is a window on technology,  management, and knowledge as well as a window on foreign policy.  From the special economic zones, we can introduce technology,  acquire knowledge, and learn management skills, which are also a  kind of knowledge. The special economic zones can function as  bases for opening up, thus not only enabling us to gain benefit  in the economic field and in the field of training competent  personnel but also in expanding our country's foreign  influence." Comrade Xiaoping's brilliant thesis on special  economic zones gave a scientific expression to the position and  functions of the special economic zones in opening up and their  significance in our country's four modernizations and also  directly guided the construction and development of the special  economic zones in our country and promoted the great practice of  reform, opening, and modernization in the whole country through  the exemplary role of the special economic zones.    The Shenzhen Special Economic Zone was China's first special  economic zone founded and developed according to Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's personal design and guidance. Over the past 14  years, under the guidance of Comrade Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics -- especially  his idea about building special economic zones -- Shenzhen has  developed from a backward border town into a modern metropolis,  in which the productive forces have been growing rapidly and the  people's living standards have been enhanced substantially.  Between 1979 and 1992, the city's gross domestic product  increased from 196 million yuan to 28.43 billion yuan, or  multiplied 147 times; the gross income of the people [guo min  shou ru 0948 3046 2392 0354] increased from 160 million yuan to  19.35 billion yuan, or multiplied 121 times; the gross  industrial output value increased form 70 million yuan to 37.138  billion yuan, or multiplied 531 times; the annual export volume  increased from $9.3 million to $5.097 billion, or multiplied 548  times. The gigantic achievements in the construction of the  Shenzhen Special Economic Zone fully demonstrated the strong  vigor and dynamism of Deng Xiaoping's thinking on building  special economic zones.  <H3>  First, Going All Out To Develop an Outward-Oriented Economy  and Accelerating the Process of Internationalizing Economic Life </H3>   Comrade Xiaoping instructed that "the orientation of the  special economic zones' economies should be shifted from the  domestic market to the international market." That is to say,  the special economic zone should go all out to develop an  outward-oriented economy, and this is a major criterion for  judging whether the special economic zone is being run  successfully.    According to the spirit of Comrade Xiaoping's instruction,  the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone went all out to develop an  outward-oriented economy. Through its efforts over more than 10  years, Shenzhen has formed an outward-oriented economic  structure which takes industry as the main component and is  composed of industry, agriculture, trade, and technology. The  zone has made great progress in the two aspects of introducing  foreign funds and technologies and exporting products to earn  foreign exchange. In 1992, Shenzhen concluded more than 10,000  agreements and contracts for using overseas funds with more than  30 countries and regions and had actually used $4.5 billion in  foreign funds. In the aspect of using foreign funds, Shenzhen  had gradually upgraded from the stage of processing materials,  assembling parts and components supplied by external clients and  processing materials according to external buyers' samples, and  conducting compensation trade to the stage of establishing the  three types of foreign-funded enterprises and moving from  labor-intensive projects to capital-intensive and  technology-intensive projects. In addition to the use of  external funds, Shenzhen also attached importance to importing  equipment, technology, and intellectual resources. At the same  time, Shenzhen made efforts to develop its overseas markets,  actively advanced transnational operations, and boldly  participated in international competition and cooperation. In  1992, Shenzhen had developed trade relations with 122 countries  and regions throughout the world, and its import and export  volume was close to $8 billion. In particular, the volume of  exports exceeded $5 billion, taking second place among all large  and medium cities in China. In 1992, exported products  accounted for 56.8 percent of the total industrial output value.  Shenzhen had also gradually become an "entrepot" for the vast  interior of the Chinese mainland, as it exported products from  the interior and imported materials, equipment, and technology  needed by those areas. Facts have shown that breaking the  closed economic pattern, continuing to open up, going all out to  develop an outward-oriented economy, and realizing the  internationalization of economic life are the fundamental  requirements for giving play to the "window" functions of the  special economic zone and is also the only way to successfully  conduct economic development in the special economic zone.    In the course of developing its outward-oriented economy,  Shenzhen brought in foreign capital to establish three types of  foreign-funded enterprises. This used to be a controversial  issue in the past. Some people maintained that this would  develop capitalism and would affect the socialist public  ownership system. During his inspection of the south in 1992,  Comrade Xiaoping gave an explicit reply to this question by  citing the facts in Shenzhen as an example. He said: "We  should not fear the establishment of more foreign-funded  enterprises, as long as we keep ourselves sober-minded. We have  advantages, as we have large and medium state-owned enterprises  and township and town enterprises. More importantly, political  power is in our hands." He added: "The three types of  foreign-funded enterprises are constrained by the political and  economic conditions of our country, and they are a useful  supplement to the socialist economy. In the final analysis,  they are conducive to socialism." This is a scientific  conclusion drawn from reality, and has great guiding  significance in both theory and practice for the formation of  the ownership structure with public ownership as the main body  and with the individual economy, the private economy, and the  foreign-funded economy as supplements, in which a variety of  economic elements will coexist and bring about common  development in the long term.  <H3>  Second, Boldly Carry Out Economic Structural Reform and  Establish a New Socialist Market Economic Structure </H3>   The special economic zone should not only play a role as a  window and a base in the course of opening up to the outside  world, but should also play an experimental and sampling role in  the course of reform and opening up to other domestic areas.  Comrade Xiaoping emphasized many times: "The Shenzhen Special  Economic Zone is an experiment." During his inspection tour to  the south in 1992, he warmly affirmed that "Shenzhen's major  experience is that it dared to make breakthroughs and break new  ground [gan chuang 2413 7068]." This required that the special  economic zone be courageous enough to carry out reform  experiments and to make explorations and innovations by breaking  through the old systems and conventions that hindered the  development of the productive forces.    In the past more than 10 years, Shenzhen persistently  carried  out market-oriented economic structural reform and carried out  bold and advance tests in many fields, thus providing a great  deal of important experience for the in-depth development of  economic structural reform throughout the country.    In the field of reforming the enterprise property rights  system and transforming the enterprise operational mechanism,  Shenzhen took the management system in the foreign-funded  enterprises as a point of reference in the course of  transforming the management system and the operational mechanism  of the state-owned enterprises. In 1987, it took the lead in  the whole country in setting up the state-owned assets  management organ -- an investment management company -- thus  separating the function of managing state assets from the  economic functions of the government. This was a useful  experiment in exploring ways to separate management power over  state assets from state ownership. At the same time, Shenzhen  also took the lead in the whole country in carrying out pilot  schemes for the adoption of the joint-stock system. At the end  of 1992, there were more than 150 share-limited companies in  Shenzhen, and 24 of them had been listed on stock exchanges.  Because their operational mechanism underwent rapid changes,  the companies that had been listed on stock exchanges  substantially increased their net assets, profits, and  tax-profit contributions. Practice shows that the joint stock  system is a good model for the reform of the enterprise property  rights system. It is conducive to the clear definition of  enterprise property rights, represents the separation of the  ownership over the enterprise assets from management power over  such assets, and remolds the enterprise into a commodity  producer and dealer that operates on its own, bears sole  responsibility for its own profits and business losses, has the  ability to make development on its own and to exercise  self-control.    In the field of cultivating the market, Shenzhen has  basically formed a comprehensive market system full of dynamism.  In Shenzhen, there are markets for consumer goods such as farm  produce and manufactured goods for daily use; markets for  producer goods such as building materials, mechanical and  electrical equipment, electronic assembly parts, and nonferrous  metals; service markets providing storage, transportation,  communications, tourist, and cultural services; and also the  auction market for movable property, the market for property  rights transfers, and the futures market. Many of these markets  have developed on a considerable scale. Various types of  markets have become rather mature, and the degree of their  openness is quite high. The market rules are almost perfect,  and the competition is rather fair. Market operation has  basically moved onto a healthy and orderly path. At the same  time, prices are basically free, and price control is exercised  on only a small number of goods and services. The prices of  most commodities are determined according to the law of value  and the supply-demand relationship on the market. The  market-determined pricing mechanism has basically taken form.    In the area of transforming government functions and  reforming economic control patterns through vertical and  horizontal power devolution, government functions in Shenzhen  have been gradually changed from direct to indirect economic  control. Such economic means as financial and taxation  policies, banking policies, foreign trade policies, and  industrial policies have been used increasingly to regulate and  control the market and guide enterprises. The economic  functions of the government have been changed, and the  enterprises have been basically separated from the government.    Over the past 14 years, Shenzhen constantly promoted  development through reform and promoted economic growth at a  high speed and in high efficiency through the transformation of  the economic structure and the economic operational mechanism.  Violent economic fluctuations were prevented. The vivid  practice proved the correctness of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  brilliant thesis that "reform is also the emancipation of the  productive forces."  <H3>  Third, Correctly Using the Useful Achievements of Capitalism  to Serve Socialist Construction </H3>   Opening up to the outside world, developing an  outward-oriented economy, reforming the old structure, and  establishing a new market economic structure are all related to  the correct use of the useful achievements of capitalism for our  own purposes. Comrade Xiaoping explicitly pointed out: We  should adopt and use all achievements of advanced civilization,  including those made by the developed capitalist countries, to  develop socialism. In a certain sense, a major point in the  experiments of reform and opening in the Shenzhen Special  Economic Zone is how to use the useful achievements of  capitalism to serve socialist construction. This includes the  development of foreign economic and trade relations, the  adoption of foreign funds, the introduction of advanced  technology and various types of professionals, the adoption of  the advanced operational forms and management methods prevailing  in the capitalist countries as they reflect the general laws  governing modern socialized production and the commodity  economy, and taking as reference some economic policies and  legislation in the capitalist countries that reflect objective  economic laws. Being limited by the space, this article will  only talk about how Shenzhen has used the effective capitalist  practice in pursuing the market economy to serve the purpose of  establishing the socialist market economy.    Over the past several hundred years of capitalist  development, a whole set of market organizational forms,  operational mechanisms, and "game" rules have taken form. They  represent the achievements of human civilization. Shenzhen  boldly adopted and creatively applied them according to the  needs of economic structural reform. For example, in the area of  reforming the enterprise management system through running three  types of foreign-funded enterprises, Shenzhen creatively adopted  and applied the operational mechanism and management experience  of Western enterprises, trained a large number of managerial  personnel, and enhanced the level of enterprise management. The  joint stock system that was adopted by enterprises in Shenzhen  was also first developed in the West. By learning from the  Western experience in developing joint stock companies, Shenzhen  took the lead in China in transforming the state-owned  enterprises according to the joint stock corporate system.  Practice has shown that the joint stock system is not  exclusively applicable to capitalism; rather, it is also an  effective form of transforming our enterprise operation  mechanism. Shenzhen also adopted the Western practice of  handling enterprise mergers and bankruptcies, and thus  established the enterprise property rights transfer system and  the enterprise bankruptcy system. This promoted the flow of  production factors to enterprises that achieve good economic  results and increased effective supply in society. In the area  of organizing and building markets, Shenzhen boldly adopted the  Western countries practice of distributing resources through the  market and commercializing the factors of production and took  the lead in the whole country in establishing the labor and real  estate markets. Land was transferred on a paid basis or was  openly put up for auction. Shenzhen also adopted Western  marketing methods, used Western market channels and sales  networks, adopted international market regulatory mechanisms,  and sold large quantities of products to the international  market. In the area of economic control, Shenzhen also adopted  the economic management methods of Hong Kong, Singapore, and  other capitalist countries and regions. The original government  departments responsible for managing various trades were  transformed into enterprises, and a series of trade associations  were set up to play a coordinating and intermediary role. The  government of the special economic zone formulated a series of  local laws and regulations with reference to the legal system in  Hong Kong and other places and according to international  practice, thus ensuring the orderly operation of the market  mechanism under the control of the "game rules." It can be said  that a major reason why Shenzhen could rapidly and smoothly move  onto the path of the socialist market economy was that it dared  and was good at adopting and absorbing the effective capitalist  practices in developing the market economy.    When using the useful achievements of capitalism, Shenzhen  adhered to the principle of "mainly applying elements to serve  our own purposes," always proceeded from the realities,  selectively adopted and introduced those elements that were  useful according to our own needs, and creatively applied these  elements. Practice has shown that, as long as we have adhered to  this principle, we would be able to correctly use the  civilization achievements created by capitalist society in order  to promote the development of the productive forces in socialist  society.  <H3>  Fourth, Constantly "Using Both Hands to Grasp" the Work, and  Actively Exploring the New Way To Develop Spiritual Civilization  Under the Conditions of the Market Economy </H3>   Comrade Xiaoping's instruction that the special economic  zones are special "economic" zones rather than special  "political" zones determines that the special economic zones  must maintain the party's leadership and adhere to the socialist  road. Therefore, in the course of building the special economic  zones, we must always pay attention to properly handling the  relationship between persisting in reform and opening and  adhering to the four cardinal principles and must use both hands  to grasp the work. Comrade Xiaoping said: "In the early 1980's,  when establishing the special economic zones, I told the leading  comrades in Guangdong that we should use both hands to grasp our  work. That is, one hand should be used to grasp reform and  opening, and the other hand should be used to severely crack  down on economic crimes and to handle the ideological and  political work. This is the two-point outlook [liang dian lun  0357 7820 6158]. During his inspection tour to the south, he  once again stressed: "Guangdong should catch up with the `four  little dragons' in Asia. Not only should it boost the economy,  but its public order and public conduct should also be improved.  It should catch up with them in the construction of both  civilizations, and only this can be called socialism with  Chinese characteristics."    Will Shenzhen be able to maintain the socialist spirit while  carrying out reform, effecting opening, and making rapid  economic development? This is an important question about which  many people are concerned. We should say that such concern is  not uncalled-for. Shenzhen is effecting a high degree of opening  and is also adjacent to Hong Kong. It is situated at the  marginal point of the two social systems and is undergoing  changes brought about by the rapid pace of reform and the  comparatively developed commodity economy. All these special  conditions have indeed brought many new contradictions and  problems to the construction of spiritual civilization. The  party committee of the special economic zone was always soberly  aware of this and attached great importance to strengthening the  construction of socialist spiritual civilization while advancing  reform, opening, and economic development. At the same time, it  also actively explored the new way to build spiritual  civilization while dealing with new issues under the new  conditions of reform, opening, and the market economy.    While building spiritual civilization, the special economic  zone mainly gave guidance to people's values and enhanced  people's quality in order to cultivate people with a lofty  ideal, with moral integrity, with good education, and with a  strong sense of discipline. The measures in this regard were  rather concrete and effective. For example, the activities of  "being good citizens and advanced units, and making Shenzhen a  civilized city" were carried out consistently over a long time  to promote Shenzhen's spirit of "pioneering, creation, unity,  and dedication." Advanced individuals and institutions were  elected regularly in the whole city on a large scale. Such  activities played a positive role in giving value guidance to  the people in Shenzhen. The party committee of the city also  dialectically analyzed and treated the changes and influence  brought by the commodity economy on the people's mentality. For  example, the concepts of equality, competition, and efficiency  are positive and progressive and should be promoted. Comrade  Xiaoping also affirmed the slogan that "time is money;  efficiency is life," which first appeared in Shekou. This idea  has now taken root in the people's minds. On the other hand,  Shenzhen was also soberly aware of the negative impact of the  commodity economy on the people's thinking and mentality and  effectively resisted money fetishism. In this regard, opinion  media played a positive guiding role. Shenzhen also made great  efforts to develop the cultural, educational, sports, and public  health undertakings. In the 11 years between 1980 and 1991,  Shenzhen's investment in educational undertakings accounted for  15.7 percent of the city's total expenditure. At present, there  are all types of large and modern cultural, education,  scientific and technological, sports facilities in Shenzhen.  This is a major achievement which makes the people in Shenzhen  proud.    Another important measure for building spiritual  civilization  in Shenzhen was to seriously carry out anticorruption struggle  among cadres and party members, and always take anticorruption  as a major task in ideological and organizational building.  Shenzhen successively adopted a series of regulations and rules  and adopted anticorruption measures such as the "two openings  and one supervision." It took the lead in the whole country in  setting up the administrative supervision bureau and the  complaint centers against economic crimes in order to intensify  management and supervision over party and government cadres. At  the same time, it strengthened the comprehensive control over  public security,and severely cracked down on various economic  crimes and other crimes. All this played an important role in  maintaining good public order and public conduct in the special  economic zone. Practice shows that, as long as we use both  hands to grasp the work, the special economic zone will  certainly be able to maintain the socialist spirit and  simultaneously develop both material and spiritual civilization  while making rapid economic development.</p>

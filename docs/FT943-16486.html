			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets - Lisbon The first 20 per cent tranche of Cimpor, the state cement group is to be publicly offered on the bourse today. The offer is seen as a test of investor interest in Portuguese privatisations, ahead of sales of stakes in the telecommunications and power utilities planned for the next 12 months. Foreign institutions, led by Baring Brothers, have underwritten 47 per cent of the public offer and the remaining 53 per cent has been underwritten by Portuguese institutions led by Banco Fomento e Exterior. A second tranche of between 20 and 25 per cent is to be sold to foreign investors in an offering on foreign exchanges later this year. The final tranche of between 20 per cent and 30 per cent is scheduled for sale in the first half of 1995, giving private shareholders control of the company. Compiled by Michael Morgan</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 4 (XINHUA) -- More than 540,000  dropouts in poor rural areas have returned to school since the  "Hope Project" to finance the education of children in  poverty-stricken areas was launched nationwide four years ago.    Cao Zhigang, an 11-year-old boy living in the mountainous  Jinggang area of Jiangxi Province recently wrote a letter of  thanks to Fang Lue, a teacher at the Beijing-based Central  Institute of Finance and Banking, who has been providing him  with a stipend.    In the letter Cao said he had scored an average of 99 out of  the possible 100 points in all subjects in his final exams last  term. He also sent to Fang a parcel of sunflower seeds he had  picked himself.    His letter was carried in advertisements for the "Hope  Project" distributed in Beijing and other major cities all over  China.    Specifically, the project involves mobilizing people from  all  walks of life to finance the re-entry to school of dropout  students in poor rural areas.    New China has made great progress in education since its  founding in 1949. However, owing to the uneven economic growth,  insufficient funding for education in poor rural areas and the  low incomes of many rural families, an estimated one million  school-age children drop out each year throughout China.    Since the China Juvenile Development Fund initiated the  "Hope  Project" nationwide in October 1989, tens of millions of Chinese  have donated a total of 200 million yuan to the fund.    Many Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan compatriots, as well as  Chinese nationals residing abroad, have also donated money to  the project.    As a result, 200 "Hope Primary Schools" have been built in  poor areas in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and Qinghai and  Gansu provinces in northwest China, as well as in Yunnan,  Guizhou, Shanxi and Gansu provinces.    An official of the China Juvenile Development Fund said that  China has about 70 million urban families, 50 million of which  are relatively well off.    If one percent of the 50 million families support the "Hope  Project," half a million children from poor families will be  able to receive an education, he said.    The project is well known all over China, thanks to the  showing of movies and TV series, and the publication of books in  support of the project, as well as widespread reporting by the  mass media.    Xu Yongguang, secretary-general of the fund, said that the  fund has introduced a whole range of systems in such areas as  accepting donations, deciding on who should receive financing  and building primary schools.    He said that China currently has 10 million children who  cannot afford an education. "The `Hope Project' has enabled  540,000 students to receive an education. So we can only say  that initial success has been scored," he said.    The amount of donations for the project in the first three  months of this year far exceeds that for the same period in  1993, he said.    The projects to be undertaken this year should finance the  education of a half a million students and the construction of  100 primary schools, he said.    He said that delegates to a conference on the project held  earlier this year decided to basically solve the problem of  dropouts within the remainder of the century and assist the  Chinese Government in making nine-year compulsory education  universal by the end of the century.</p>

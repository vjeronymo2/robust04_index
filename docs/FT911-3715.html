			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Ratners to shed jobs despite profit rise RATNERS Group, the jewellery chain, will implement a cost-cutting programme this year leading to the loss of up to 1,000 jobs, as it tries to combat recessionary markets in the UK and the US. Although the company pushed annual pre-tax profits up from Pounds 108.22m to Pounds 110.05m before property gains, Ratners' fully-diluted earnings per share fell 9 per cent to 23.6p as cost increases outstripped sales growth. Mr Gerald Ratner, chairman, said the company would reduce staff by 5 per cent as well as cut stockholding and distribution costs and trim some of its guarantees and credit terms. 'It is no good just hibernating like a hedgehog during a recession,' he said. Sales in the year to February 2 topped Pounds 1bn for the first time, climbing 24 per cent to Pounds 1.11bn. The results were buoyed up by the inclusion of Kay Jewelers, the US chain which was bought for Pounds 207m last year. Kay, which has been quickly integrated with Ratners' existing Sterling business in the US, contributed Pounds 14m to operating profits. Overall, operating profits rose 3.6 per cent to Pounds 134.25m. The UK saw a reduced contribution of Pounds 79.74m (Pounds 93.37m), but the US added Pounds 54.5m (Pounds 36.12m). Most of Ratners' UK high street chains registered comparable sales increases: H. Samuel produced a 13 per cent gain; Ratners, 18 per cent; and Zales and Ernest Jones 19 per cent. Watches of Switzerland, the group's most upmarket chain, suffered from a drop in tourists and recorded an 11 per cent slide in sales, while Salisburys, the handbag chain, incurred a loss of Pounds 1m. Salisburys will be trimmed from 220 stores to 170 at an exceptional cost of Pounds 2m. An extraordinary charge of Pounds 6.74m was also taken as a result of the company's decision to shut its Regent Jewellers chain, which operates 43 stock clearance branches. Ratners said it had increased its market share in the UK by 3 percentage points to 33 per cent and that it now commanded 5 per cent of the US market. Mr Ratner said: 'With the competition collapsing there is nothing out there to stop us.' A final dividend of 7.6p will lift the annual pay-out to 10p, a 5 per cent increase. Ratners Group said that Sir Victor Garland, a non-executive director of the Prudential Corporation, had joined the board as a non-executive director.</p>

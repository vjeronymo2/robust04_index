			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Raghidah Dirgham and Ibrahim Humaydi: "Israel </F> Proposes Comprehensive Deal `Assuming' Full Withdrawal in Five  Years"]    [Excerpts] New York, Damascus, occupied Jerusalem -- U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher yesterday evening conveyed  to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres the outcome of his talks in Damascus with  President Hafiz al-Asad and Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' on  peace between the two sides and ways of reactivating direct  bilateral negotiations.    While Syrian sources spoke of the negotiations' entering "a  new and fundamental phase dealing with minute details,"  well-informed sources in New York told AL-HAYAH that Christopher  had carried to the Syrian leadership a new Israeli offer which  represents "an integrated deal" that covers all the elements  concerning the Syrian-Israeli relationship, beginning with  security through to details of a specific timetable for  withdrawal from the Golan, as well as Hizballah's future in  southern Lebanon.    The sources added that the new Israeli offer stipulates a  phased withdrawal to be completed in five years, not eight years  as mentioned in the first offer. The Israeli proposal "assumes"  "full" withdrawal from the Golan, linking this with the other  elements in the deal, first and foremost security, not only with  regard to the Golan but in southern Lebanon as well, since  disarming Hizballah represents one of the deal's elements.    U.S. and Israeli diplomatic sources expect "difficult and  protracted negotiations" with the Syrians. They point out that,  if the Syrians and the Israelis want to reach an agreement, this  agreement should be reached within a year, that is before  Israeli elections begin. [passage omitted]    In Damascus, well-informed sources expect Christopher to  return to the Syrian capital to convey Israel's position on the  Syrian plan and to resume his role in bringing views closer.  They told AL-HAYAH that Damascus is still awaiting the  "password" from the Israelis. "We are still awaiting the word  `full' withdrawal from the Golan. When they agree to it, all  possibilities will open to discuss all the other questions that  follow that." [passage omitted]    Syrian sources have said that the peace process has entered  "a new and fundamental phase" with Christopher's conveying of  the two sides' views of peace. They added that Christopher's  decision to return to Damascus "means that there are extensive  U.S. efforts aimed at steps to help the parties to move closer  to one another and make progress on the long road toward peace."  They went on to say that Damascus "welcomes the U.S. endeavors  and hopes that the U.S. secretary's tour will result in a  fundamental and constructive breakthrough, in order to advance  the peace process and consolidate the constants of a peaceful  solution." The sources reemphasized that "the condition needed  to make Christopher's mission a success is Israel's response to  full withdrawal from the Golan." [passage omitted]</p>

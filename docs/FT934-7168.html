			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Capital losses on BES MANY investors will have learned that their ventures into Business Expansion Schemes devoted to building homes for rent are turning out badly, especially true for schemes initiated around 1988-90. In a typical case an investor will have put in Pounds 10,000, received Pounds 4,000 in tax relief and now has an investment worth Pounds 6,500. His apparent net gain of Pounds 500 is derisory, but does he have a capital loss of Pounds 3,500 to offset gains elsewhere? No, because section 150(2) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 says: 'A gain or loss which accrues to an individual on the disposal of any shares issued after 18th March 1986 in respect of which (BES) relief has been given to him and not withdrawn shall not be a chargeable gain or allowable loss for the purposes of CGT.' Ask your tax office for the free pamphlets IR51 (Business expansion scheme) and IR85 (Business expansion scheme: Private rented housing). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES;  </P> <P> CONGRESSMEN ACCEPT TRIPS AND $161,750 IN HONORARIUMS  </P> <P> San Fernando Valley-area lawmakers received a total of $161,750 in honorariums  from special interest groups in 1989 and accepted expense-paid trips to such  destinations as Tokyo and Mexico City, according to annual financial disclosure  reports made public Tuesday.  </P> <P> Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) led the way with $60,300 in speaking fees,  followed by Reps. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands), $31,000; William M. Thomas  (R-Bakersfield), $28,500; Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), $22,700, and  Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale), $19,250.  </P> <P> Reps. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) and Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles)  accepted no honorariums or trips funded by special interest groups.  </P> <P> Faced with growing criticism that special interests were buying influence with  honorariums, the House voted to prohibit the appearance fees, beginning in  January, 1991, as part of a pay-raise measure passed last fall. The Senate has  not adopted such a ban.  </P> <P> Current House rules permit a lawmaker to retain a maximum of $26,850 in  honorariums annually. Waxman kept $26,808, gave another $31,296 to charity and  used $2,196 to cover unreimbursed expenses incurred while earning the  appearance fees. Lewis gave $4,500 of his fees to charity and pocketed $26,500.  </P> <P> In many instances, the interests of the group providing the honorarium  corresponded to the lawmaker's committee assignments and legislative influence.  </P> <P> Waxman, chairman of a House subcommittee on health and the environment,  received most of his fees from health industry associations. This included  $5,000 each from the American Health Care Assn., Merck Pharmaceutical, the  National Council on Prescription Drugs and the American Veterinary Medical  Assn. He also got $4,000 from the Illinois Hospital Assn.  </P> <P> Lewis, a member of the House Republican leadership who sits on the  Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, export financing and related  programs, received $2,000 each from the Tobacco Institute, Connell Rice and  Sugar, the International Sweetener Colloquium and the National Beer Wholesalers  Assn.  </P> <P> Lewis, whose 35th District includes part of Palmdale in Los Angeles County,  also accepted transportation, food or lodging for 11 trips, including a  weeklong sojourn to San Diego and Mexico City and Guadalajara, Mexico, to meet  with business and government leaders. The tab was picked up by the  Congressional Economic Leadership Institute, a business-funded nonprofit  organization in Arlington, Va., that seeks to educate lawmakers on trade  issues.  </P> <P> Thomas, whose 20th District includes Lancaster and the northern Antelope  Valley, sits on the Ways and Means Committee, which writes tax legislation. His  honorariums included $2,000 each from the Securities Industry Assn., Mobil  Corp., the National Assn. of Real Estate Investment Trusts and the Employees  Council on Flexible Compensation.  </P> <P> Berman, who is involved with communications issues on the House Judiciary  Committee, received $2,000 from the California Cable TV Assn., $1,500 from the  National Cable TV Assn. and $1,500 from the National Assn. of Broadcasters.  </P> <P> A member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Berman also accepted an  expense-paid trip to Tokyo from the Japan Society. He attended the U.S.-Japan  Parliamentary Exchange Conference, a weeklong meeting of American and Japanese  lawmakers to discuss mutual concerns, said Gene Smith, Berman's administrative  assistant.  </P> <P> Moorhead, who is active in cable television regulation as a member of a House  subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance, received speaking fees of  $1,500 each from the National Cable TV Assn. and the National Assn. of  Broadcasters. The veteran lawmaker, who is also a member of a subcommittee on  Energy and Power, accepted another $2,000 from the Interstate Natural Gas Assn.  and $1,000 from the Keystone Center Energy Project.  </P> <P> Beilenson has long eschewed honorariums, which he has criticized as tantamount  to legalized bribery. Gallegly, who had received a small number of speaking  fees in previous years, said through a spokesman that he made a decision not to  accept any honorariums last year.  </P></p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Survey of Design in Europe (14): 'We shall act as the glue'  -Changes in design policy in several EU member states When the UK government last autumn announced a radical reform for the Design Council it marked the end of an era for British design policy. It also heralded the beginning of a dynamic, new design initiative which, so the government hopes, will meet the needs of UK industry into the next century. The UK is not the only European country to have implemented sweeping changes in design policy. The Dutch government last year launched a new Netherlands Design Institute. The French system is in a state of flux as the Agence pour la Promotion de la Creation Industrielle (APCI) attempts to redefine its role following the withdrawal of the state's support. Even the European Commission is considering ways of modernising its design strategy. Each country - or institution, in the EC's case - has tailored its approach according to its own needs, but it is possible to identify common strands in the new public sector design policies of the 1990s. The old design promotion organisations were, typically for the post-war period, vertically-integrated bodies with large staffs and an interventionist style. The new breed tend to favour a more flexible approach by operating on a small scale as catalysts between the design community and other areas of the economy. They also tend to be more tightly focused towards industry than their predecessors, which also often had the philanthropic aim of raising design awareness among the public. 'Our aim is to create an inspirational organisation,' says John Sorrell, chairman of Newell &amp; Sorrell, the corporate identity design consultancy, who has orchestrated the reform of the UK's Design Council as its chairman. 'We're going to act as the glue between the UK's designers, its design infrastructure and industry.' The creation of the new Design Council has been a complex and painful process - although it is indicative of the depth of the government's commitment to the project that it allowed John Sorrell to map out a blueprint for a new body rather than simply abolishing the old one. The old Design Council, which employed 250 people with activities ranging from conference management to magazine publishing, is now being pared down to a new body with a staff of 50, Many of the old activities will be sub-contracted to external specialists. Mr Sorrell, who is determined that the new Design Council will be 'faster on its feet and more visible' than its predecessor, also plans to co-opt 'guerrilla groups' of designers and industrialists for specific projects. He has started with a series of research initiatives  - including an analysis of design's effectiveness in industry and an overview of the government's use of design - which will mark the launch later this year of the new Design Council on the 50th anniversary of the original body. The new Netherlands Design Institute has also cast itself in a catalytic role. It was founded 18 months ago as part of an overhaul of Dutch arts strategy which also led to the foundation of similar organisations in parallel fields including photography. John Thackara, the institute's director, sees the organisation as a 'facilitator' to build bridges between the Dutch design community and other fields, notably industry and the arts. He and his team have already liaised with external consultants to identity centres of excellence in Dutch design, such as graphics and typography. They are now initiating projects, again in liaison with external specialists, to facilitate the future development of those areas particularly in the fields of new technology and multi-media. While the UK and the Netherlands stride forward into the future, the French are still trying to find a new direction for design policy. Until recently the Association pour la Promotion de la Creation Industrielle, a public sector body funded by the culture ministry, was the linchpin of design promotion in France. Its most notable recent project was last summer's controversial Design: Mirror of the Century exhibition of 20th century design at the Grand Palais in Paris. However, the APCI's influence was steadily eroded in the late 1980s, as the then socialist government set up a series of regional design centres linked to local business bodies such as chambers of commerce. These new centres are more concerned with the business community than the APCI which, under the influence of the culture ministry, tended to concentrate on artistic initiatives aimed at the public, rather than industry. The current conservative government withdrew its funding from the APCI earlier this year, which was then threatened with closure. The association has since managed to secure the support of the Paris Chamber of Commerce and is now assessing its future under its new, more commercially-minded patron. Meanwhile the European Commission is revising its design policy to ensure that it plays a complementary role to the raft of national and regional bodies. Its design activities come under the aegis of Sprint - alias the Strategic Programme for Innovation and Technology Transfer - within DG13, the part of the commission which is responsible for innovation and telecommunications. The focus of the EC's design activities has since the late 1980s been the European Community Design Prize, which is intended to encourage small and medium-sized companies to make the most of design as a competitive tool. The prize was introduced in 1988 and is awarded every two years. The latest prizes were awarded last Friday at a ceremony in Amsterdam to Kompan, the Danish children's playground equipment manufacturer, Luceplan, the Italian lighting company, and Vitra, the Swiss office furniture group which has its main manufacturing base in Germany. The aim of the prize, according to Antonio Doronzo, head of Sprint's design projects, is to reward small and medium-sized companies for achieving 'all-round excellence in design'. The winners must demonstrate that they have reached the highest possible standards of design in their products, communications activities and the environment of their operations. These companies can then be used by the Sprint team as role models for others to follow. Mr Doronzo is now looking at ways of expanding the European Commission's design activities. He envisages the prize continuing to be the focus of its design promotion effort for the foreseeable future, although he is interested in broadening its ambit possibly to include young companies that are using design as catalysts for growth. 'We have been considering lots of different roles for the commission in design promotion as we do think we could make more effort in this area,' says Doronzo. 'But design is a complex subject. We're well aware of that and are very anxious not to impose a single view across the European Union when design can mean very different things in different countries.'</p>

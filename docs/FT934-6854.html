			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Arts: The Purcell Experience - Concerts in London This was Roger Norrington's seventh 'Experience' weekend. The format of talks, exhibitions, chamber and orchestral events provides the opportunity for audiences to immerse themselves in a composer's mind and music. This year's focus of attention was Purcell, which meant that the 'Experience' also counted towards the South Bank's celebrations leading up to the composer's tricentenary in 1995. If such a prestigious national event can call forth the funds, we may yet get a full re-enactment of what extravagance really meant in Restoration theatre. This weekend could only hint at it with its closing performance of The Fairy Queen. Before the main event a lecture examined how Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream was trimmed, coiffured, given a virtual short-back-and-sides to suit late 17th-century fashion. An example of how individual lines were rewritten was especially telling, not least because on this occasion we were to get Elkanah Settle's version of the play together with Purcell's music, both complete, though unstaged - a full four-hour entertainment, which overran vastly. The re-coupling of play and music is for special occasions only. There is barely any connection between the two, except the overall feel of the period spectacle, best judged when seen (if ever again) with the lavish sets and costumes that were an integral part of the show. The interesting feature at the Queen Elizabeth Hall was how vividly the neutered portions of the Shakespeare still held the attention - a plus point for some lively acting. Any thinking conductor of Purcell these days has his opinions on the texts and Norrington is no exception. For The Fairy Queen he re-ordered a couple of items. He has no double-bass in the London Baroque Players. And he prefers high tenors (Howard Crook and Mark Padmore, nicely contrasted, both able and musical) to counter-tenors. After a couple of very characterful performances of this piece recently in London from Les Arts Florissants and the Gabrieli Consort, it seemed at first that Norrington might be on the dry side. The Schutz Choir was not placed ideally forward. Nor were all the female soloists as well parted as Lorraine Hunt, who had a few uncertainties as to where the music was going, but none at all about her voice, a full, gleaming, far from standard baroque soprano. By the end, however, all doubts had faded. Norrington had given us humour without vulgarity, variety without gratuitous extra colouring, the passing shortcomings of his rivals. How inventive a score this is, full of magic, comedy and feeling - in so many ways a worthy parallel to the Shakespeare play it so naughtily misrepresents.</p>

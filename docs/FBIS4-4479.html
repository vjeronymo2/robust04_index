			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 31 KYODO -- Mexican Ambassador to  Japan Sergio Gonzalez Galvez said Thursday [31 March] two  Japanese banks will shortly start operations in Mexico.    At a press conference the ambassador declined to mention the  names of the banks, but said there are two Japanese banks among  the foreign banks which Mexico will allow to operate. He said  the banks will invest a total of 20 to 40 million U.S. dollars  each in Mexico.    Mexico has basically allowed no foreign banks to open  hitherto, but the government has been lifting regulations on  foreign banks in line with the North American Free Trade  Agreement.</p>

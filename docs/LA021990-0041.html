			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOST THINK PRIVACY RIGHT IS IN CONSTITUTION, POLL FINDS  </P> <P> Most Americans believe the U.S. Constitution gives them a right to privacy in  their personal lives that shields them from government interference in such  things as the sex acts of adult homosexuals and a family's decision to end life  support for a hopelessly ill relative, according to a survey on the Supreme  Court and the Constitution released Sunday.  </P> <P> The notion of a constitutional right to privacy is so firmly entrenched that a  majority of those surveyed asserted -- incorrectly -- that the right is written  into the Constitution.  </P> <P> While the word "privacy" does not appear in the Bill of Rights or anywhere else  in the Constitution, a majority of the Supreme Court has concluded that the  "right to liberty" in the 14th Amendment implies a right to privacy in matters  such as birth control and abortion.  </P> <P> But this conclusion remains a subject of continuing dispute between the court's  conservative and liberal factions.  </P> <P> The liberals say the general rights set forth in the Constitution should be  interpreted broadly to protect individuals from the government. But the  conservatives maintain that the court should not create unwritten  constitutional rights so as to strike down laws enacted by the majority.  </P> <P> This dispute flares anew with each abortion case to come before the high court.  It also figures prominently in the battles over drug testing and the "right to  die."  </P> <P> The survey responses suggest that the public finds the right to privacy as  tricky and troublesome as has the high court.  </P> <P> Although 73% of those surveyed say the Constitution guarantees a right to  privacy, a solid majority said this right does not allow employees to refuse  drug tests, nor does it give teen-age girls the right to get an abortion  without their parents' knowledge.  </P> <P> The survey of 805 adults was conducted for the National Law Journal and LEXIS,  the computerized legal research service, and was intended to mark the 200th  anniversary of the Supreme Court.  </P> <P> It found that most Americans could not name a single member of the Supreme  Court, nor even how many members of the court there are. The respondents also  said -- incorrectly -- that last year's abortion ruling from the high court  allowed states to make abortion illegal. The 5-4 ruling in June said states may  prevent their employees from aiding abortion, but women retain the right to  terminate a pregnancy.  </P> <P> Nearly six in 10 of those surveyed drew a blank when asked to name a sitting  justice. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the court's only woman, was by far the  best known of the nine justices. Most of those questioned disagreed sharply  with the court's recent decisions on flag burning, civil rights and  homosexuality.  </P> <P>  -- Only 40% agreed with the court's 5-4 ruling last year that flag burning was  protected as free speech. About 46% disagreed with the decision, and in a  separate response, 63% favored a constitutional amendment to prohibit flag  burning.  </P> <P>  -- Only 31% said the court has "gone as far as it should" to protect victims  of discrimination, while 53% said the court has "not gone far enough." In a  series of 5-4 rulings last year, the court narrowed the scope of federal civil  rights laws.  </P> <P>  -- About 66% said the right to privacy "protects private, voluntary acts of  homosexuals," while 26% disagreed. In 1986, the court ruled 5 to 4 that states  may criminalize private homosexual behavior.  </P> <P> However, the public agreed with the court majority on drug testing. Only 34%  said the right to privacy prohibits random drug testing of employees. Last  year, the court voted 5 to 4 to uphold drug testing for public employees in  jobs involving safety or sensitive information.  </P> <P> When asked who should decide whether to "end artificial life support" if you  lapse into a coma, 88% said "your family." In a pending dispute between a  Missouri family and state officials, the court must decide whether the parents  of a comatose woman can decide on their own to stop feeding her.  </P></p>

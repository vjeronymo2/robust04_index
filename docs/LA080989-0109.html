			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> COLLEGE FEE HIKES MODERATING  </P> <P> The decade-long surge in college costs is moderating slightly this fall with  average tuitions heading just 5% to 9% higher, according to a College Board  survey released today.  </P> <P> Total annual costs at the priciest private schools will exceed $21,000.  </P> <P> Still, the annual survey had welcome news for at least some beleaguered  students and parents: Tuition and fees at two-year public colleges will rise an  average of 5% to $842, a bit under the current 5.9% rate of inflation.  </P> <P> That is a rarity in a decade in which college costs have consistently exceeded  the nation's overall inflation rate -- a fact that has led critics like former  U.S. Education Secretary William Bennett to sharply question college  management.  </P> <P> At their worst, costs at both public and private institutions rose in double  digits from 1981 through 1984. Rates at four-year public colleges shot up 20%  in 1983-84 before beginning to level off.  </P></p>

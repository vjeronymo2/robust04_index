			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINE OF THE WEEK AND BEST NOUVEAU OF THE YEAR  </P> <P> 1990 Quady Electra -- This low-alcohol (4%) wine from Andy Quady is 100% Orange  Muscat with a hint of carbonation.  </P> <P> You could drink three glasses and get the alcohol equivalent of just one. It's  delicious -- sweet, but not too sweet. It's a grand experience -- at $9.50 a  bottle.  </P></p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Letter: Oxleas Wood victory is not an isolated case Sir, Tim King gave a good account of the campaign that saved Oxleas Wood ('If you protest in the woods today', July 10), but he was wrong to conclude that it 'looks like an isolated cause'. It is only the latest in a number of road schemes to be dropped since 1990: the London Road Assessment Studies; the Exeter northern by-pass; the Hereford by-pass; the Woodstock by-pass. Contrast this with the 1980s when the Department of Transport rarely suffered a setback. Moreover, there is a growing transport and environmental movement which is calling for a switch of road-building resources to investment in other modes of transport. The Oxleas Wood victory will have given it added momentum, placing other roads schemes long cherished by the transport department in real danger. John Stewart, chairman, Alarm UK (Alliance Against Road-building), 13 Stockwell Road, London SW9</p>

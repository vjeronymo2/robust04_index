Achasova, Computing Center of the </F> Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences; UDC  681.322]    [Abstract] Synchronized interpretation of parallel  microprograms with different microinstruction execution times  over cellular arr ays is studied. A description of asynchronous  implementation of parallel microinstructions and the definition  of its correctnes s is contrasted with a model of synchronized  interpretation. A number of examples are presented. A method of  resolving the situation of possible command conflict is  outlined. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the  correctness of the interpretation are formulated and a method is  presented to recognize incorrect interpretation using the text  of the microprogram.

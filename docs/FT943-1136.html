			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / People: Homing in on the vulnerable - In moving from Shelter to the Consumers' Association, Sheila McKechnie tells Diane Summers, she will still fight for the underdog Sheila McKechnie is characteristically blunt about the mistakes she made when she took over nearly 10 years ago as director of Shelter, the British housing charity. A warm, noisy and energetic person, the 46-year-old Scot admits that the restructuring she was forced to carry out might have been less painful if she had been more experienced and better attuned to other people's frailties. 'I completely underestimated people's insecurity. I'm a person who sees change as the essence of life; dealing with people who got defensive in the face of change was something I just didn't understand,' she says. 'I'm very strong on strategic management . . . people management is not so strong.' Her words may cause some hearts to sink at the Consumers' Association, the organisation which, it has just been announced, McKechnie will take over in January. More change and conflict will be the last things many of the staff there will want. The CA, best known as publisher of the 700,000-circulation consumer magazine Which?, has had a rough ride recently, with open conflict between staff and its abrasive current director, John Beishon, as well as public debate about its role in the age of the increasingly sophisticated consumer. But McKechnie will tread extremely carefully, especially at first. 'When you're dealing with a very established organisation, the worst thing you can do is go in and say everything that's been done in the past is wrong and you want to change it.' She is respectful of the association's professionalism and expertise - a sensible stance, since at present she cannot have much more than an informed outsider's knowledge of many of the issues with which the association deals. Lack of technical knowledge will not hold her back for long, and any CA boffins hoping to blind her with science should beware. McKechnie's confidence is breathtaking. If she fails to grasp something you have just said - well, it is likely to be your fault and you had better try again. A regular on Question Time or Any Questions, she is bound to pop up again within weeks of starting her new job and to sound utterly convincing in her new role. This confidence does not stem from a privileged background. She describes her family as 'very ordinary Scottish working class'. She was born in Falkirk (the local newspaper calls her The Battling Bairn) and was head girl at the high school. She was the first member of her family to go to university (Edinburgh) and, after a degree in politics and history, did what many bright, socially-conscious, vaguely leftwing people did at the time: she went to work for a trade union. On the way she stopped off for an MA in industrial relations at Warwick University and a year at Oxford on a research contract. The union she joined was the tiny Wallpaper Workers' Union (wallpaper printers, rather than painters and decorators). After a brief spell as a Workers' Educational Association lecturer, she joined the white-collar union, ASTMS, with which her smaller union had been in competition. The next nine years were spent as national health and safety officer there before she became director of Shelter. At Shelter she initially earned a bit of a reputation as someone who occasionally shouted first and asked questions later; there were some sackings and resignations. Now she commands great respect among professionals in the charity industry and enormous affection within Shelter, which she has taken from fewer than 50 staff and a turnover of Pounds 1m to around 250 staff and a turnover of about Pounds 10m. Lingering criticism of her style does not bother her unduly. 'Anybody in my position is going to have people who criticise them and say they're far too directive and they've got too strong views. But then that's part of the leadership role,' she says. And Shelter needed leadership when she took over. 'I very quickly realised that it was an organisation that had turned in on itself. Employees were directing a lot of their attention to the inside of the organisation and not engaging with the issues,' she says. 'There was a very 1960s mentality.' This held that everyone in the organisation should be highly principled and compete to be on the left of everyone else. 'You made a statement, then got into your bunker and pulled down the shutters.' McKechnie has turned Shelter into a fast-response organisation offering practical advice and services to homeless people, as well as campaigning on topics such as repossessions forced on people who get behind with mortgage payments. It has also, she says, had to conduct the 'campaign of its life' to defend existing legislation, which offers at least some protection to the most vulnerable. The charity is probably more in the public eye than at any time since the days of founder Des Wilson and the early TV film, Cathy Come Home. Her successor, she says, will face a tough time. 'Nothing is going to change substantially in this government's policies. There's also the possibility of an attack on housing benefit, which could lead to much higher levels of homelessness. None of the political parties has given housing the priority I think it should have.' She particularly objects to what she sees as the government's obsession with owner-occupation. 'The British level of owner-occupation is incompatible with a modern, well-functioning economy,' she reckons. How does all this serious stuff fit in with best-buy pop-up toasters and the other middle-class preoccupations of the average Which? reader? McKechnie warms to her new theme. 'We are all consumers. People are having to make big financial decisions about their future and their children's future in a context where a lot of people are trying to tell them to do things which are not in their interest. I feel very shocked about what's happened in the financial services industry.' Anyway, she says, 'if you're poor and your kettle breaks down after six months and you need another one, it could be a financial disaster'. Some weeks ago, John Beishon, the outgoing CA director, who feels he has come under attack unfairly for trying to modernise the association, said in a newspaper interview: 'I have a feeling there will be a terrible pressure to go back to the way things were and to regard this (my tenure) as a horrible nightmare.' With the announcement of McKechnie's appointment, he says these fears have vanished. CA's ruling council 'clearly resisted that pressure and has made a very imaginative and bold appointment. The council asked me to give CA a higher campaigning profile and to put it more in front of people as the consumer champion - which I think I did. Now she's going to take it further still and I think that's excellent.' There are those who find the association already too strident, says Beishon. 'They're living in the past. In the old days, influencing our society was done by phoning up a minister because you'd been at school with him - and it always was a him. You had a quiet lunch at the club and a few words were said. That world has gone.' The Battling Bairn is the woman for the new one.</p>

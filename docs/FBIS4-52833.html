			<p>BFN     [Text] Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai, at a news  conference on the morning of 12 May, said: "The deregulation  process is coming to a crucial point now. But if we leave the  matter to bureaucrats, there is no question they will drag their  feet. Political leadership on it is now being asked. All  ministers must make all the efforts possible to have  deregulation achieved even if it means risking their political  career." He made this remark in comment on the public  discontent about deregulation that it is making hardly any  progress in the face of bureaucratic resistance.    Degulation makes up a major part of the package of measures  for opening up Japan's market as the demand of the United States  and other nations. The government wants to work out plans for  it by the end of June, and Kumagai's comment is intended to  assert government's determination to strongly push for  deregulation under political leadership.    Before this news conference, Kumagai had met with Koshiro  Ishida, head of the Management and Coordination Agency, and  agreed to call an informal meeting of ministers concerned to  discuss the deregulation question soon. Ishida proposed the  meeting, saying: "Deregulation is a key point in economic  reform. Let us infuse more enthusiasim into the ministers to  get this done by all means."</p>

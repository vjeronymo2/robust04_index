			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> CHARGERS;  </P> <P> ROD BERNSTINE STILL BOTHERED BY HAMSTRING  </P> <P> Rod Bernstine's hamstring is still bothering him, which probably means Ronnie  Harmon will get increased playing time at running back for the second week in a  row when the Chargers (5-5) play Sunday at Kansas City.  </P> <P> Coach Dan Henning said he wasn't sure if Bernstine would be able to play,  though Bernstine said he felt a lot better in practice Wednesday than he did  last week, when he could barely walk. Marion Butts, the starting running back  who didn't start last week because of a thigh bruise, is likely to start  Sunday.  </P> <P> Harmon replaced Butts as the starter in Sunday's 19-7 victory over Denver and  had a season-high 10 carries for a 7.1-yard average. Harmon has carried 39  times in 10 games, which isn't a lot, but considering he had a total of 17  carries all of last season in Buffalo, he isn't complaining.  </P> <P> Besides, anything is better than Buffalo. This is his explanation for why he  didn't play more while with the Bills: "Because the coach didn't like me and  the quarterback didn't like me. It wasn't a matter of whether I could play or  not it was a matter of if they wanted me in there or not. And that's just the  way it went."  </P> <P> Being a Charger is different.  </P> <P> "Everybody is here to play football, not to see who likes who," Harmon said.  "You come here to work. That's it. After that you go your separate ways. It  shouldn't matter whether you like that person or not. As long as you do your  job on the field that's all that matters."  </P> <P> H-back Joe Caravello, who suffered a season-ending injury to his kneecap in  practice three weeks ago, paid a visit to the Charger locker room. He was on  crutches.  </P> <P> Wearing a brace that looked big enough for a redwood tree, Caravello said he  feels bad not to be a part of the recent winning streak. That doesn't mean he's  sorry they've picked up steam since he went down.  </P> <P> "I hope they go to the playoffs," he said. "That's the only way I can make any  more incentives."  </P> <P> Caravello, who had surgery two weeks ago, has begun rehabilitation but won't be  healthy enough to play football for at least three months.  </P> <P> Punter John Kidd switched dressing chambers Wednesday in search of a little  solitude. He used to be next to kicker John Carney. No more.  </P> <P> Carney kicked four field goals in Sunday's victory over the Broncos and there  were so many reporters crowded around Carney that Kidd couldn't get to his  locker.  </P> <P> Wait long, John?  </P> <P> "At least two or three minutes," he said. "At least."  </P> <P> As Kidd was moving his stuff Wednesday, Carney said: "The man eats my Danish  (pastry) and reads my newspaper and now he's dogging me."  </P> <P> But at least Carney will have more room to hold court.  </P> <P> "He's going to convert this locker into a podium with a microphone," Kidd said.  "There just wouldn't be room for all my stuff."  </P> <P> Chargers questionable for Sunday's game: Bernstine (hamstring), linebacker  Richard Brown (thigh), Butts (thigh), cornerback Gill Byrd (ankle), safety  Vencie Glenn (thigh), guard David Richards (shin).  </P> <P> Kansas City Chief injuries: Center Tim Grunhard (thumb), safety Jeff Donaldson  (knee), and linebacker Dino Hackett (shoulder) are all questionable.  </P> <P> Quick statistic: Dan Fouts is one of 10 NFL quarterbacks who has passed for  more than 30,000 career yards. Fouts (43,040) reached this mark in 131 games,  fewer than any of the others. John Unitas (40,239) reached this mark in 141  games, Joe Montana (33,889) in 147. DON PATTERSON  </P></p>

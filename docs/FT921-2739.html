			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Company News: Belgian cement maker drops 12.4% CBR, the Belgian cement group, yesterday reported a 12.4 per cent drop in 1991 profits to BFr3.63bn (Dollars 105m), but in the light of expansion in North America and Europe announced a BFr20 per share increase in dividend to BFr270. Profits followed the downturn in Europe and recession in North America, the company explained. However, the volume of its business held up, and because it bought several US companies making ready-mixed concrete and building aggregates, overall group turnover rose last year by 7.2 per cent to BFr46.33bn. There was, however, a sizeable drop in net profits for Cimenteries CBR, the Belgian parent company, to BFr1.95bn last year compared with BFr4.26bn in 1990, when the company recorded some extraordinary profits from leading subsidiaries. Cash-flow expanded as the group increased investment in the Tehchapi cement plant in California and expanded its Tilbury plant in British Columbia. It further strengthened its west coast presence by buying ready-mixed concrete and aggregate companies in California, Washington state and Alberta, as well as closer to home in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. Early this year, it took a stake in Mokra, a leading southern Czech cement producer, of which it will gain majority control by the end of 1994.</p>

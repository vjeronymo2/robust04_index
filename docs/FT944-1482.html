			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Simply the only answer to a simple question Sir, On reading Joe Rogaly's article, 'Down with the lottery]' (December 17/18), and quite apart from his many comments which are open to criticism, may I ask the question, 'Who is the most simple?' 1) He who goes for a 14m-to-1 gamble; or 2) He who queues for 10 minutes in the wrong line. I believe that the answer is 'simple'. Roger Heminway, 34 Shelbourne Place, Park Road, Beckenham, Kent</p>

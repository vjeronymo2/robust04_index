An environmental assessment was undertaken in conjunction with the development of the Resource Conservation and Development (RC&amp;D) Measure Plan. This assessment was conducted in consultation with local, State, and Federal agencies as well as with interested organizations and individuals. Data developed during the assessment are available for public review at the following location: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, 1835 Assembly St., room 950, Columbia, SC 29201. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Recommended Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal includes the construction of a running track at the Battery Creek High School. The High School, Beaufort County School district and the local athletic committee have committed over 78% of the funds needed for the project. The engineering plans and specifications have been completed by the school district and only financial assistance is requested. State and/or local permits concerning water or air pollution will be obtained prior to construction by the local sponsors. The Corps of Engineers 404 permit and South Carolina Coastal Council authorizations will not be required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Effect of Recommended Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Battery Creek High School has an enrollment of 1,200 students of which 61.5% are minority. Improved recreational facilities will enable students to practice and compete with other schools which will increase self-esteem, reduce dropout rate, improve grades to remain eligible to participate in sports, and, overall, will develop a more well-rounded citizen. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No land use changes will occur as the track will be constructed on an established recreational area. The proposed action will have no effect on wetlands nor will it affect archaeological and historical areas, since the track will be built around an existing football field. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Endangered or threatened plants or animals are not known to exist on the site. The topography of the site is generally flat and all adjacent lands are protected with permanent grass. The soil is Sewee Fine Sand and is not considered to be prime or important farmland. The area has been committed to recreation by the school. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No significant adverse environmental impacts will result from installation of this project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The planned action will provide a high quality track and field facility which will minimize injuries and allow the students to compete with other school districts in field and track competition, thereby developing self esteem and student pride. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because no significant adverse environmental impacts will result from installation of the measures, no other alternatives, other than the no project, were considered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Consultation_Public Participation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Formal agency consultation began with the initiation of the notification of the State Single Point of Contact for Federal Assistance on February 11, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An interdisciplinary scoping trip was not conducted because the proposed project is planned to be placed on previously developed school property. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public meetings with regard to this project have been conducted during local district meetings and by actions of the stadium committee and booster clubs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The stadium committee and booster clubs are volunteer organizations with a goal of improving the athletic facilities of Battery Creek High School. The ultimate objective being to provide a better atmosphere to improve learning and produce better citizens for the community and the area. These organizations have raised over $5,000 toward this project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The environmental assessment summarized above indicates that this Federal action will not cause significant local, regional or national adverse impacts on the environment. Therefore, based on the above findings, I have determined that an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Battery Creek High School Recreation Facility RC&amp;D project is not required. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: April 12, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Ellis Morrow, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Acting State Conservationist. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;9647 Filed 5&hyph;23&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;16&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

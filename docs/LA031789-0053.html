			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> UNEVEN, UNLIKELY SEQUEL IN 'HEART OUTRIGHT'  </P> <P> Mark Medoff's "The Heart Outright" (at the Lex), a pair of one-acts focusing on  the same character, is a strange sort of sequel.  </P> <P> The character is Stephen Ryder, appropriated from Medoff's first major success,  "When You Comin' Back, Red Ryder?" (1973). Before intermission, it's 1979 and  Stephen addresses the audience in a monologue. Afterwards, it's 1983, and  Stephen is in a conventionally realistic play, complete with the fourth wall  separating the actors from the audience.  </P> <P> The first act is less of a sequel than the second, with fewer references to the  incidents of "Red Ryder," and it's more successful. Living in Austin, Tex.,  Stephen runs a porno movie theater, but he does it honorably. He takes pride in  his theater, if not in the movies he shows. As he talks to the audience, he  meticulously cleans the lobby.  </P> <P> The play portrays a man who desperately clings to certain values because they  give him sustenance, not because they help accomplish anything in the outside  world, which appears to be sinking slowly into the mire. The inherent irony is  hammered home a little too hard by actor Brett Cullen, but the performance is  undeniably engaging.  </P> <P> One quibble about John Iacovelli's set: the movie posters in the lobby are  sexually teasing ads for mainstream movies, not porno flicks. Why would Stephen  help promote the competition?  </P> <P> In the second half of "The Heart Outright," Stephen has returned to his  hometown in New Mexico, where "Red Ryder" was set, for his mother's funeral.  He's about to board a bus back to Texas when he's accosted by former classmate  Dick Turpin (Willie Garson) who now manages the bus station; by Angel (Lauren  Tewes), who liked him back in 1969 and still pines for him; and by his greedy  ex-stepfather (Will MacMillan).  </P> <P> Primarily through the character of Dick, Medoff misrepresents our impression of  Stephen from "Red Ryder." In Dick's eyes, Stephen became a hero in the events  depicted in "Red Ryder," when he and Angel were among the hostages briefly held  by an outlaw in the diner where they worked.  </P> <P> In fact, there's no reason why anyone -- even dim Dick -- would think of  Stephen that way at the end of "Red Ryder" or thereafter. Yes, during "Ryder"  he makes one abortive attempt to overpower the gunman of that play, but it's an  attempt accurately described by the gunman himself as "inept." After the bad  guy leaves, Stephen is seen hitching a ride out of town.  </P> <P> So the second half of "The Heart Outright" inflates Stephen's reputation only  to turn around and deflate it, to show us his shortcomings -- something we've  already seen. Why bother?  </P> <P> The second half works better when Stephen is dealing with Angel instead of  Dick. The Stephen-Angel exchanges are less contrived. And Tewes' assured  performance as the quickly aging Angel is rather affecting, especially when  contrasted with Garson's annoyingly mannered overplaying of his overwritten  role.  </P> <P> Cullen, meanwhile, tones down Stephen during intermission -- maybe because he  no longer carries the play by himself -- and creates a skillfully restrained  characterization of a cynical but upright guy.  </P> <P> Sheri Kane directed, for A Directors' Theatre.  </P> <P>  At 6760 Lexington Ave., Hollywood, Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.,  Sundays at 2:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m., through April 23, with a signed performance  on April 8. Tickets: $10-$15; (213) 466-1767. DON SHIRLEY  </P></p>

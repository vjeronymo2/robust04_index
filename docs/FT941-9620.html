			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Arts: Heritage of the recent past - Architecture Heritage is a flexible word, and some people may be surprised to hear of it being applied to the present century. But at a seminar in London last week, the word was used to describe post-war (the second world war) architecture in England. The seminar was part of a campaign by English Heritage to inspire more public debate about the listing and protection of the nation's post war buildings. The listing system, which protects historic buildings in England, is an area of contention. Listing does not necessarily protect a building from demolition. But the process can make demolition difficult if planning authorities apply listing regulations with rigour, causing delays and frustrations wherever possible. Sometimes, however, planners let buildings fall down or agree to certificates of immunity from listing in a way that does no credit to the system or to the consistency of bureaucratic judgment. It takes a partisan architectural historian or a practising Marxist to see merit in many of the concrete towers and crumbling town centres that passed for architecture in the years 1945-1970. It is difficult to find a consensus on the quality of much of the detritus of that period, which was why English Heritage called the conference. It was wise of English Heritage to include in their deliberations not just the naturally biased architects of that generation, but also property developers, engineers and town planners and members of the press and public who care about architecture. It was English Heritage, under the sometimes inspired chairmanship of Jocelyn Stevens, which initiated a research programme in 1991 to encourage both experts and the public to consider a more systematic approach to listing the architecture of this tricky period. The most difficult architectural, aesthetic and philosophical judgments are those about the period that is nearest to us. This is just as true when it comes to literature, painting, sculpture and music. Judgment needs the perspective of time. When the idea of listing buildings began as a result of the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act, the problem buildings were those of the Victorian and Edwardian periods, and nobody was looking at the work of the architects who designed buildings during the reigns of Kings George V or VI. It was not architects, but writers like the late Sir John Betjeman and Dr Mark Girouard, who encouraged the development of a public affection, sometimes a sentimental one, for Victoriana and Edwardian taste. To date, what listing has supposedly achieved is the recognition of the major architectural creations of all periods up to the recent past. A building has to be 30 years old to be considered for listing, with the one exception; that of a later building which is considered outstanding, if it is in grave danger of demolition or irrevocable alteration. In 1970 that great lister of the buildings of England, Sir Nikolaus Pevsner, identified the first 50 inter-war buildings to be listed. Today there are more than 600. It is his legacy of thoroughness that inspires the researchers of English Heritage. Some 750 post-war schools, colleges and universities were carefully examined and last year the Secretary of State for National Heritage accepted the recommended final list of 95 separate educational establishments. It is a fascinating, if controversial, list which includes three schools designed by the pioneering Hertfordshire County Council in the late 1940s and early 1950s. These are schools redolent of the brave new world that was about to emerge through the policies of the welfare state. They are the antithesis of the cosy Victorian village schools; they have large windows, colourful panels and that sense of perpetual sunshine that was to enlighten our post-war children. I was a post-war child and I well remember that strange mixture of excitement and disappointment when I was transferred from an Edwardian citadel of learning, with its copper domes and rows of arched windows, to a naked and pristine new box unrelieved by any aspirational ornament. There are some horrors on the educational list that are no doubt historically important, like the school at Hunstanton in Norfolk by Alison and Peter Smithson; the first but not, sadly, the last Brutalist school. James Gowan and James Stirling's Leicester University Engineering Building, in all its angular red glory, is now a listed building as an original pioneer of British High tech architecture. Sussex University by Sir Basil Spence, England's first post-modernist architect, is now an elevated Grade I monument. That distinction rightly belongs also to St Catherine's College, Oxford, by the Danish master of modernism Arne Jacobsen. There are other types of buildings on the first major post-war list - Coventry Cathedral by Sir Basil Spence and, as of last week, the Roman Catholic Cathedral of Christ the King in Liverpool, designed by Sir Frederick Gibberd. That great adventure in reinforced concrete with its staggering parabolic curved roof, the 1952 Stockwell Bus garage for London Transport by the architects Adie and Button, is now a starred Grade II. Public housing from the post war period is a very dicey area. So often the idea is significant, but the quality of execution and maintenance leaves a lot to be desired. Tower blocks like the Trellick Tower by Erno Goldfinger and the 'cluster' block, Keeling House in Bethnal Green (now in decay and more or less uninhabited) by Sir Denys Lasdun are on the list as cynosures of a particular moment of social housing. An exhibition of some of the grand ideas and failed ambitions of the post-war period will tour the country to encourage more public involvement in the listing process. It can be seen in the City of London at 125, Cutler's Exchange, Hounsditch from 16-25 of February under the winning title: 'Age of Optimism'. It is worth seeking to enter the debate. After all, anyone can write to the Secreary of State for National Heritage to suggest a candidate for listing. It is all much too important to be left to architects.</p>

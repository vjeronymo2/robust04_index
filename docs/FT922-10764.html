			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Pro-EC stance adopted by new think tank the first to link a pro-EC stance with the market-led economic philosophy of Thatcherism. President of the European Policy Forum is Mr Graham Mather, who recently quit after five years as director-general of the right-wing Institute of Economic Affairs over political differences with the IEA's Euro-sceptic founders. The forum, chaired by Lord Hunt of Tanworth, a cabinet secretary to four prime ministers, is described as 'a non-partisan combination of discussion forum, channel for international contacts and think tank'. Membership of its governing council crosses a wide range of political territory. It includes Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, Sir Christopher Tugendhat, former Tory EC commissioner, Lord Holme, leading Liberal Democrat policy adviser, Sir Roy Denman, former EC ambassador to Washington, Mr Goron Tunhammar, president of the Swedish employers' federation, Mr Samuel Brittan, an assistant editor of the Financial Times, and Mr Martin Jacques, former editor of Marxism Today. Launching the forum at its Queen Anne's Gate offices last night, Lord Hunt told an audience which included Mr John Major, the prime minister, that the Maastricht treaty  - while a great achievement  - had prompted concern about an overly centralist Community that raised new challenges. 'This does not mean a retreat into Euro-scepticism, but rather finding the right way forward,' he said. He added that the forum had received non-partisan support, including finance, from across Europe. The forum was also welcomed by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. 'I look forward eagerly to pungent and stimulating contributions to debate from the European Policy Forum,' he said. While the forum stresses the catholic nature of its support, it will focus on deregulation and the transformation of public services. Mr Frank Vibert is also joining from the IEA as a director.</p>

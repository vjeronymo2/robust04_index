			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Stocks need time to settle - Investing in . . . China CHINA has opened the gates to foreign investment at last and money is pouring in. The potential for growth on an unprecedented scale is plain. China has the largest population on earth and a cheap workforce. Most Chinese share the work ethic of other Asian economic success stories such as Japan and Hong Kong. Senior leader Deng Xiaoping's 'open door' policy of economic liberalisation has included the establishment of two new stock exchanges, trading in shares which have an ingenious capital structure to ease the difficulties for foreign fund managers. But European investors still need the answers to two questions: Is the economy vulnerable to political change? The enlightened technocratic liberalisation being applied to the economy sits awkwardly with the brutish massacre of students in Tiananmen Square, Beijing, in 1989. There is understandable reluctance to put funds at the mercy of a regime led by a man of 87 which has shown it will not baulk at authoritarian measures reminiscent of Stalin. Some observers are, however, confident that economic reform is there to stay. Deng is trying to ensure a succession committed to economic liberalisation. Over the past six months he has moved several members of the liberal faction into key posts, and is expected to consolidate power at the 14th party congress scheduled for November. The communists also appear to have realised that some form of liberalisation and market discipline will be necessary to deliver an adequate standard of living. Experience of Europe's former eastern bloc shows what can happen to political regimes if living standards are poor. In any case, though, Deng's initiatives have already attracted enough foreign investment to make U-turns difficult. The economic data are astounding. China managed real gross national product growth of 7.0 per cent in 1991, and industrial growth of 12.9 per cent. The five-year plan for 1991-95 has already raised its target for GNP growth from 6 per cent a year to 9 per cent. Meanwhile the people are thrifty but have little on which to spend their money. This has led to a savings ratio calculated by Barclays de Zoete Wedd (BZW) at around 30 per cent, suggesting healthy prospects for any company which can produce something they want to buy. Is the Chinese market the best place to buy exposure to the Chinese economy? China now has two stock exchanges, in Shenzhen and Shanghai. The authorities have gone to elaborate lengths to make life easy for foreign investors. Each company issues two classes of share. 'A' shares may be bought only by locals, while 'B' shares are reserved for foreign investors. John Kelly, of BZW Investment Management, is enthusiastic. 'The system is marvellously well organised. In China, there are authorised brokers and dealing is electronic. They've got rigorous controls on how companies can be listed and they use international accounting standards.' This does not mean the market is immune to problems. Shanghai's 'B' share market now has a total capitalisation of USDollars 151m, while Shenzhen's is Dollars 685.2m. These tiny figures may illustrate the potential for growth, but they also show the tightness of the market. It is not easy to spread risk if you invest only in 'B' shares. Many claim that investors' enthusiasm to take advantage of these new opportunities has left the market overheated and overvalued. The high Chinese savings ratio has led many locals to try to buy 'B' shares, constricting supply for foreigners. In Shenzhen, a typical 'B' share trades off a price-earning multiple of 30, while 'A' shares are on multiples of 37 to 40. Many fund managers have, therefore, decided to avoid 'B' shares and buy their exposure to China elsewhere in the Far East - particularly Hong Kong. According to Kenneth King of Kleinwort Benson Investment Management: 'China is the most exciting investment area in the world at the moment. But going from there to setting up a fund to buy a very small number of 'B' shares which are grossly overpriced is quite a leap. It's perfectly obvious that the market is grossly overheated.' Tim Williams, of Schroders Asia, takes a similar view: 'Almost inevitably, gravity will assert itself and then there will be a major fall. And that's when I plan to buy.' There are differences between China's two markets. While Shenzhen, just across the water from Hong Kong, is the larger, most of its quoted companies are joint ventures with the colony. This makes it all the easier to buy Chinese exposure with a Hong Kong fund. Shanghai was the largest market in Asia before it was shut down forcibly by the communists in 1949. The companies planning to come to the market there in the next few months are a different proposition from Shenzhen as they are mostly in heavy industries, like Shanghai Chlor-Alkali and Shanghai Tyre and Rubber. Most previously were state-owned monopolies. This offers the kind of direct exposure to Chinese growth which is difficult to buy in Hong Kong or Taiwan. So how should a private UK investor get involved? There are five authorised unit trusts investing in Hong Kong and many more investing in a range of Pacific rim countries. None of these is a 'widows and orphans' investment but they offer some diversification. China is not an authorised market, so onshore unit trusts cannot be bought. But several offshore funds have been launched this year to buy 'B' shares. These include Barclays China (based on Jersey); the GT Shenzhen and China fund, which is registered as a unit trust in Hong Kong and listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange; and Hafnia Prolific's China Opportunities fund, which is listed on the Dublin stock exchange. Of these, only GT is restricted exclusively to 'B' shares; it is now 65 per cent invested. The others have scope to invest in Hong Kong and other local markets, and Hafnia Prolific, which is a fully-authorised fund, has only a maximum of 10 per cent in 'B' shares. Minimum investments are not prohibitive compared with unit trusts. Companies more sceptical about 'B' shares, such as Schroders and Kleinwort Benson, offer large 'emerging market' funds. These spread risk across several markets. China offers rewarding prospects for those prepared to take a risk. But it could be best to limit that risk via a broad fund for the time being until the country's well-organised stock markets have had the time to mature.  ------------------------------------------------ FACTFILE: CHINA  ------------------------------------------------ Population (1991 estimate):             1,158m Gross Domestic Product (1991):    Pounds 210bn Real GDP growth (1991):           7.0 per cent Market Capitalisation:        USDollars 835.2m Inflation rate:                   3.4 per cent Exchange rate:            Pounds = 10.608 Yuan  ------------------------------------------------ Total available for foreign investors Source: Prolific Asset Management  ------------------------------------------------</p>

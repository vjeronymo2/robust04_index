			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Gatt deal hostage to US voters With smears and sensation-alism outweighing political debate in election campaigning this year, disillusioned US voters have more on their minds than the future of the world trading system. But trade officials around the world are thinking a lot about US voters - and about the special post-election congressional session that they hope will ratify the Uruguay Round trade liberalisation deal. Administration officials, plagued by partisan bickering, had a struggle getting the Uruguay Round implementing legislation to Congress in time for a vote this year. In the end Congress went into recess for the November 8 elections before voting on ratification. It will reconvene after the elections for a rare 'lame duck' session - attended by many retiring members and by those who failed to win re-election - before the new Congress is sworn in. The US is assuring its trade partners the deal will win approval by December 1, in time for launch on January 1 of the World Trade Organisation as successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). Officials say at the moment pro-Gatt forces have 70 votes in the Senate, 10 more than needed for passage of the treaty. They also maintain they have at least 260 in the House, where they need 218. But business lobbyists are uneasy about the uncertain political environment. Will voters 'throw the rascals out' and vote in populist protectionists? Will defeated or retiring incumbents be reluctant to vote as 'lame ducks' in the specially recalled session? Will incumbents in tight races submit to the demands of the Uruguay Round's foes by committing themselves to vote against it or promise to delay it until next year? Opponents are warning voters the Gatt deal would weaken US sovereignty over its health, safety and environmental regulations and hurt farmers around the world. They say trade liberalisation has moved US production abroad. Playing on public distrust, the anti-Gatt activists portray the 'fast-track' procedure - frequently used to pass trade deals because it prohibits congressional tinkering - as an effort to sneak a weighty 4,000-page agreement through Congress without debate. Mr Ross Perot and Mr Pat Buchanan, two former presidential candidates, are leading opposition on the right. On the left are Mr Ralph Nader, the consumer activist, unions and environmental groups. 'We will do a national targeted effort to urge the candidates to say before November 8 whether or not they will vote in favour of the Gatt deal,' said Ms Jane Danowitz of the Citizens Trade Campaign, an umbrella opposition group. Mr Chris McGinn, a spokesman for Mr Nader's Public Citizen, said: 'After the election, we will make the very legitimate point that many people who have been fired by the voters have no right to vote in a lame duck session.' His group will monitor departing congressmen and their staffs 'that have a direct connection to the Gatt' for conflicts of interest as they seek new jobs. Meanwhile, big corporations that have been financing the pro-ratification lobbying efforts have been slow to pledge additional funds. But in Ohio a coalition of businesses is meeting with congressional candidates to describe opportunities for their companies provided by the Gatt deal. Caterpillar is backing a coalition of 263 companies in Illinois. 'The other side is effective at sensationalising trade issues,' says Mr Bill Lane of Caterpillar. 'What unifies Nader, Buchanan, and Perot isn't political philosophy. It is that they all believe in protectionism.'</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Write-downs hit Uni Storebrand UNI STOREBRAND, the Norwegian insurer, yesterday revealed a big loss in 1992 due to a NKr2.63bn (Dollars 373m) write-down on the group's 28 per cent stake in Skandia Forsak-rings, Sweden's biggest insurer. Uni reported a consolidated pre-tax loss of NKr3.38bn against a profit of NKr471m in 1991. Last August, Uni collapsed into the hands of public administrators after failing to service NKr3.6bn in short-term debt accrued to finance a failed raid on Skandia. Uni said it would strive to dispose of the NKr4.7bn Skandia stake as soon as possible. Group net operating income rose slightly last year to NKr20.48bn from NKr19.54bn as operating costs remained largely the same at NKr4.07bn. Mr Per Terje Vold, chief executive, said that, considering the difficult times which the group had experienced, the results achieved by the life and non-life divisions were acceptable. 'We are pleased to note that the results of the life and non-life insurance companies improved significantly during the last four months of the year,' Mr Vold said. The life insurance division lifted premium income by NKr90m to NKr4.74bn in 1992, but investment income fell by NKr387m to NKr4.99bn. Operating profit rose to NKr1.91bn from NKr1.09bn. The share portfolio was written down by NKr537m. The non-life business saw premium income in 1992 fall by 2.5 per cent to NKr6.872bn as operating costs were cut by NKr128m to NKr1.8bn. Operating profit rose to NKr345m from NKr281m. Uni said the non-life result was compromised by a NKr123m loss due to a hurricane which struck north-west Norway. It also suffered a NKr168m realised loss and write-down on the securities portfolio. The group's international business saw premium income rise by 6.5 per cent to NKr4.702bn, but investment income fell by NKr175m to NKr323m. The division plunged into an operating loss of NKr546m last year, against a profit of NKr64m a year earlier. Uni said the poor result was due in part to a NKr164m charge to cover damage resulting from hurricane Andrew. The international business will engage in reinsurance business only while the marine, oil, satellite and liability operations are to be transferred to the non-life business once approval is given by authorities. Mr Vold forecast an improvement in 1993 through cutting costs, increasing premiums and reducing the risk profile of investments.</p>

The foreign ministers informed His Excellency President  Hafiz  al-Asad of their countries' complete support and recognition of  Syria's pan-Arab orientation. Their closing statement also took  note of Syria's visible and vital role in the peace process and  the importance of the upcoming Geneva summit between Presidents  Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. They expressed the hope that  the session will advance a just and comprehensive peace based on  UN Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425, the  land-for-peace formula, an Israeli pullout from all the occupied  Arab territories, and the restoration of Palestinian rights.  President al-Asad made it clear to the Arab foreign ministers  that Syria will continue to be driven by the same pan-Arab  policies it has set for itself; namely to defend Arab rights and  pursue a just and universal peace in the region. Thus, the Arab  foreign ministers who came to Damascus to voice their solidarity  with Syria and its stands, have, in effect, confirmed President  al-Asad as a spokesman for the Arab nation and a champion of its  rights and causes in the planned summit with the U.S. president.  As well as being Syria's roaring voice, Al-Asad will be the  voice of all the Arabs and the true articulator of their  aspirations. Against the background of a stalled Middle East  peace process, Arabs across the Arab world naturally attach the  highest importance to this summit. Israel has been trying to  deal with the Arab states one at a time and promote partial  settlements and separate deals that can hardly lead to peace or  meet the aspirations of Arab masses. Syria has won the  international community over to its argument that a Middle East  settlement found lacking in justice and universality is doomed.  That Mr. Clinton is going to a summit in Geneva shows that the  United States is sold on the idea of a just and universal peace  and a central role for Syria, not only in its own right, but  also as a spokesman for all the Arabs and a repository for their  hopes and aspirations.    The genuine support voiced by the Arabs for Syria's agenda  and al-Asad's pan-Arab orientations will make the historic  Geneva session even more important. Assuming that the session  proves useful, it will give a fresh impetus to the peace process  and advance a just and universal peace and put the stalled talks  back on track. However, if the summit is to succeed the United  States will have to further implementation of the UN Security  Council resolutions -- the principles on which the Madrid  conference and the Washington talks were launched. These  resolutions are absolutely clear on a number of key issues: A  total Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, a  halt to Jewish settlement building there, and the restoration of  Palestinian rights. The Americans themselves have summed these  up as the land-for-peace formula.    The Washington talks were an opportunity for Israel to climb  on the bandwagon of the Middle East peace process. But Israel  has deliberately passed up all the chances to make peace,  choosing land grabbing and repression over peace and  tranquility. It has almost wrecked all the American peacemaking  efforts and led the region to the brink of an explosion.    It is high time Israel showed a real interest in peace and  the international community moved to impose a just and universal  peace and force Israel from all occupied Arab territory.</p>

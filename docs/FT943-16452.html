			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / French bank to shed 1,100 jobs The troubled French bank Credit Lyonnais has secured the agreement of two of the largest banking unions to shed 1,124 jobs from its workforce in the first phase of a rationalisation programme. Overall, the bank plans to cut 3,500 jobs over three years, representing nearly 10 per cent of its staff in France. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman, announced details of the package earlier this year following the conclusion of negotiations with the French government for a FFr44.9bn (Pounds 5.34bn) state-backed rescue plan. Mr Peyrelevade's management team has since been embroiled in tense negotiations with the banking unions. The bank has promised to seek no forced redundancies until next April. Credit Lyonnais is now awaiting publication of an official parliamentary report into the cause of its present financial problems. The final document could come out within the next few weeks.</p>

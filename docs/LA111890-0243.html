			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NURSE HOPES HER FIRING SUIT HELPS OTHER RESERVISTS  </P> <P> Debra M. Simpson, the nurse and National Guard captain who was fired from her  job at a private Santa Ana health clinic after a hitch of active duty, said  Saturday that she is suing the clinic partly to protect other reservists who  leave their civilian jobs during the Persian Gulf crisis.  </P> <P> "I think this happens more frequently than people realize," said Simpson, who  was fired last month. "For those that don't have the support or the ability (to  sue) -- that's why I'm doing this. . . . People who choose to be in a reserve  unit, they have a right to do that."  </P> <P> Her eyes occasionally welling tears, Simpson, 35, said she is suing the Care  Visions Kangaroo Kids Center also to remove what she believes is a stain on her  reputation, caused by the firing.  </P> <P> Simpson had worked there for about seven months as a nurse and a health care  administrator. Her lawsuit was filed last week in Orange County Superior Court.  </P> <P> Representatives of the children's health center did not respond Saturday to  telephone messages seeking comment.  </P> <P> The center issued a statement Friday, defending the firing of Simpson as the  clinic's nurse administrator.  </P> <P> "Our concern at all times," the statement said, "has been and is the well-being  of the children in our care."  </P> <P> The statement added that Simpson was fired because, in the view of management,  "she was due back to work on Oct. 1 but did not show up or call."  </P> <P> Simpson disagreed, saying that she had told the health clinic's chief executive  officer twice orally and once in writing that she would not return to work  until Oct. 3, a Wednesday.  </P> <P> Simpson said she was unable to recover a copy of the written notification,  because clinic officials told her that they could not find the document.  </P> <P> Simpson, who lives in Tustin, said she was not aware of any tensions with the  management of the health center or dissatisfaction with her performance before  she was called up Aug. 6.  </P> <P> "There didn't seem to be any problems until I returned," Simpson said. "And  then, an hour after I returned, on the third, I was fired. . . . They then said  that I was fired for abandonment of position. As an administrator, that's very  strong language."  </P> <P> Simpson said when she first discussed the matter with her bosses, on Aug. 1,  she envisioned serving a "voluntary" period of active duty. But on Aug. 2, Iraq  invaded Kuwait, quickly changing the lives of U.S. reservists.  </P> <P> On Aug. 6, Simpson said, her status changed and she was ordered to report.  </P> <P> She said she served the next few weeks in a hospital emergency room in  Nuremberg, Germany, replacing personnel who had been shifted to the Persian  Gulf.  </P> <P> Simpson said she returned to California late on the night of Sept. 29 and did  not consider it necessary to check in by phone with her clinic bosses.  </P> <P> Clinic officials, in their statement Friday, said they had tried to call  Simpson and delivered, by courier, a letter to her. Simpson denied receiving a  letter and said that if attempts were made to call her, they were not recorded  by her telephone answering machine.  </P> <P> Simpson said she is receiving "a lot of support" from her National Guard  colleagues who, like her, worry whether reservists will lose jobs as the United  States masses troops in the Middle East.  </P> <P> "There are companies out there who are good about it," Simpson said. "But there  are other companies where it is a struggle."  </P></p>

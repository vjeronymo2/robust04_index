			<p>CSO     [Text] The heinous massacre perpetrated by radical Jews at  the Ibrahimi Mosque [Tomb of the Patriarchs] has come at a time  when Palestinians have been in a race with time to establish  institutions that will manage the Palestinian economy. Even  though this incident represents a setback for the peace process,  it clearly reflects the importance of accelerating the creation  of these institutions so Palestinians can prove that they are  capable of managing their daily economic life without  intervention by the occupation authorities, keeping in mind that  it has been decided that the Israeli administration will hand  over the Gaza and Jericho territories on 13 April 1994.    The core of the Palestinian economic institutions is the  Palestinian Economic Development and Reconstruction Agency  [PEDRA], which has been operating temporarily from offices at  Jerusalem's Seven Arches Hotel since mid-January, when its  directors were appointed. In the occupied territories, PEDRA is  headed by Hasan Abu-Lubdah, the deputy executive director for  the occupied territories.    PEDRA departments consist of a projects department, a  finance  department, an economic policy department, and a department to  select projects and to link non-governmental projects with  technical aid.    The administrative director is Ahmad Quray', also known as  Abu-'Ala', who is the PLO Finance Department chairman. He is  headquartered outside the occupied territories. The agency's  deputy executive director is Sari Nusaybah, a professor at Bi'r  Zayt University.    The agency's main task is to create institutions. This  entails establishing contacts with the World Bank and with other  international aid-supplying organizations to get their approval  for the appropriate structure to manage the $2 billion in aid  that the world community has promised to provide.    Agency officials emphasize that the agency is independent.  Abu-Lubdah has said that the agency will do more than just spend  money and that it is not just a channel through which financiers  deliver their funds.    The agency's final internal structure has not been announced  to date. It is expected that the arrangements will include two  main departments that cover project management and sector  management. The first will be entrusted with accounts and  auditing and the second will cover the sectors concerned with  education and with project evaluation.    The agency's communications will be handled by international  advisers who can submit regular reports to aid-providing  organizations, because the primary concern of these  organizations is clarity and feasibility. Even though the agency  wishes to be independent, lenders say that it will not control  the current financial aid infusions, but that it will select the  projects and will prevent the entanglement of technical aid. As  for the financial aspect of awarded contracts, it will be within  the jurisdiction of the aid-providing countries.    One of the agency's fundamental tasks is to draft the new  administration's budget for the first five years. This was  agreed at a meeting held in Paris between the advisory group  representing the aid-providing parties and the Palestinians on  28 January 1994.    The agency has set the 1994 budget at nearly $268 million.  This includes the wages of 22,000 civil employees who will take  over responsibility from the Israeli administration. The budget  also covers the expenses of new agencies, such as the police  force, which is expected to consist of 8,000 members. A sum of  $137 million will be provided for special expenditures, which  will not show up in the annual budget, because this sum is  designated for the preliminary expenses of creating the  administrative authority. This sum also covers a program to  rehabilitate prisoners and provide jobs. It is expected that the  budget deficit will amount to $158 million. The aid-providing  parties have pledged to cover 75 percent of this deficit.    It is also expected that excess funds will be channeled  toward special expenditures rather than current expenditures.    Moreover, it is expected that the administration will  collect  revenues of $250-$300 million in taxes to cover current  expenditures and will resort to domestic borrowing to balance  the budget.    An important priority will be to set up a tax-collection  authority to take over from the Israeli administration on 13  April 1994.    PEDRA has been criticized by the aid-providing countries for  its failure to create a tax-collection authority fast enough.  PEDRA has to deal with this issue promptly.    In addition to PEDRA, plans have been announced recently to  create a Palestinian development organization to develop  economic ideas.    Nabil Qassis, one of PEDRA's directors, is drafting a plan  for this organization that will operate independently of PEDRA  and that will compile data on trade, currency, financial issues,  and labor issues. This organization will also have a department  to evaluate projects.    The plans to establish this organization have received  financing from the World Bank and have been accepted by the  aid-providing countries. Middle East affairs specialists at the  World Bank have said that this organization will work  side-by-side with PEDRA and with the Palestinian Statistics  Bureau, headquartered in Damascus.    A preliminary plan has been drafted to set up a Palestinian  development bank, and it awaits the approval of PLO Executive  Council Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. The bank, expected to have a  capital of $200 million, will be an independent establishment.</p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Placer Pacific soars despite gold output fall PLACER Pacific, the Australian gold mine, reports a 50 per cent increase in net earnings to ADollars 50.4m (USDollars 34.1m) for the six months ended June despite a substantial fall in gold production, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney. The higher earnings stemmed entirely from positive tax adjustments. Before tax, profit fell by 45 per cent to ADollars 37.4m on revenue down 21 per cent at ADollars 236.3m. The dividend is going up from 3.5 cents a share to 4 cents.</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Aborigine fund move defeated Efforts to increase significantly the money available to a federally constituted Aboriginal land fund were defeated yesterday in the Senate, the Australian parliament's upper house. The fund is designed to acquire land on behalf of the vast majority of Aborigines who will see no practical benefit from the country's Native Title legislation, which was passed with much difficulty last year. The Native Title act was the first piece of legislation to acknowledge that Australia was inhabited before European settlement. At that stage the government promised to set up a land fund to make acquisitions on behalf of dispossessed Aborigines. However, when details of the scheme were released, critics said it was too small to be viable, and poorly structured. Amendments put forward, but defeated in the Senate yesterday, would have increased funds flowing into the land fund to ADollars 15bn (Pounds 7bn) over a 10-year period. The current government plan is for just ADollars 1.4bn, over the same decade - with much of this money being invested to ensure that the fund is self-sustaining in 10 years.</p>

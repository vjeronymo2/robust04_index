			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / People: Prudential appoints outside all-rounder The Prudential has broken new ground in the appointment of Lorraine Baldry, aged 43, to be managing director of its property division, which manages the largest property fund in the country. In an industry largely run by male chartered surveyors, her appointment is not only unusual in that she is a woman; she is also notable for her limited experience of the property industry, where she has worked for just three years. Baldry, whose early experience was in the computer industry, is used to having a different background from her colleagues. For five years from 1982 she was the head of the BBC's engineering computer services. She was the most senior woman in the engineering department and one of few employees to lack an engineering qualification. 'I have never suffered from not having the background of the organisation I have worked for,' she says. 'IT people have to be good at learning the business.' Baldry, who began work as a computer programmer after leaving school, has worked for a wide variety of organisations, ranging from her own consultancy, which she formed in 1975, to RCA Records, where she was head of management information services. She says she has never needed to adapt her style to the very different corporate cultures of these organisations. 'Power dressing is a load of garbage. I wear suits. I wear the same style of clothes I have always worn,' she says. Her appointment as managing director is merely the latest in a series of changes affecting Prudential Property Managers over recent years, since Hugh Jenkins arrived as chief executive. The division has shed over a third of its staff, has streamlined its management structure and is installing a new computer system. Her recent elevation from chief operating officer to managing director reflects the Prudential's choice of a manager with all-round business expertise, rather than specialist property knowledge, to head the division of 700 people who manage five funds worth Pounds 3.7bn. Her promotion coincides with the announcement of the departure of Christopher Edwards, a director of PPM, who oversaw property investment matters.</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Gardening: Now's the time to chop up a border BRITAIN'S amazingly warm weather has sent gardeners back to their flowerbeds, looking for damage, checking for early blooms and planning for the seasonal's replacements. By now, we all have flowers on the primroses; the buds are open on magnolias; and there is an uneasy sense that the world is six weeks ahead of itself. Myself, I have a mass of dead dianthus and some nasty patches in other parts which hate the wet winter: what should be done now to bring borders up to the mark? The first tip is often forgotten: since wet winters wash goodness out of the soil, you must now put it back. Late March is the time for a general garden fertiliser and, by habit, I usually choose Growmore. Half-hearted gardeners probably shirk this expense because they think the money might be wasted, but I know from experience that it is essential. Nowadays, there is a great fashion among the uninitiated for concentrated, super-charged fertilisers, of which the most popular seems to be 6-X. These brands have their uses, but users tend to believe they are like oats to a racehorse: the more you feed, the faster the plant will travel. The opposite is true. If you double the dose, you will do much more harm than good. Concentrated fertilisers really must be applied at the strength set out on the packet. As a general garden dressing, a balanced chemical compound is preferable at this time of the year. The second tip is topical and, for once, saves money. If you have gaps, begin by dividing good plants which you own already. The next fortnight is an ideal time for division and the task is extremely simple. Dig up an established clump; put it on a hard surface; decide how many bits you want, remembering how small a piece now is from most nurseries; then, slice straight through a mat of main roots with a sharp blow from a spade. Plants with a single main root or a wooded main stem are unsuitable candidates for division: leave lupins or poppies well alone. It is also too late now to split border irises and expect them to flower: delay your attack here until early July. There are plenty of alternatives which you can multiply by aiming straight. My favourite victims are hardy geraniums, especially the admirable Johnsons Blue; the one exception is the rare eriostemon, which seems to take years to recover from this treatment. I am also pleasantly surprised at the ease with which herbaceous clematis, especially the handsome blue Wyevale form, will split into willing fragments. Pieces may look woody and miserable, but they soon grow away like mad. As most plants now cost Pounds 2 or more apiece, it pays to strike out with a spade this weekend. Phloxes, day lilies, campanulas, hostas, agapanthus, lychnis, and even the lemon-yellow anthemis with its daisy flowers - all are plants which respond well to a short, sharp slice. Michaelmas daisies, too, are wonderful splitters and one of the best, the pale-blue Aster frikartii, is actually improved by the experience. Always use the outer bits of the clump as they are younger and more vigorous. These daisies can be as tough as telephone directories to would-be rippers, though. The books suggest that you use two forks driven back to back through the middle of the plant so that they can then be teased outwards, pulling it to pieces. I find this trick is rather hard to carry out and I much prefer to use two spades, driving them into the centre like tomahawks, one after the other. The great advantage of splitting is that you pay nothing and can choose your own size of plant. Alternatively, you can buy something new from a garden centre, but you need to be vigilant at this time of the year. From March onwards, growers are potting their smaller stock into bigger containers, filled with peat. Until it has grown away, you might be deceived by the size of the pot and end up with a much smaller plant at a much bigger price, paying for peat rather than roots. If you do have a genuine choice, it is more economical to buy a big single of anything which you can split. All week, I have been enjoying the dozen double-flowered primroses which I split from a single parent last spring, as soon as I bought it. Individual plants would have been much more expensive and, by now, no better. Lastly, what do you do where you have a failure in the middle to back of a border and need height quickly? The white-flowered lavatera Barnsley will certainly grow and fill the space, but it soon luxuriates too much and is too leafy for formal company. Personally, I prefer a trick which you can see in excellent evidence in the terrace borders at Powis Castle. Buy a tripod of three tall bamboo canes, fixing them together with wire. Wrap some wire netting round this framework and plant one or two clematis on either side of this tall support. If fed properly, these will race away and flower up to a height of 5-6 ft later in the summer. Some of the best forms, including Perle d'Azure, are too vigorous for this position but I have had excellent results from white Henryi and the lovely, dark red Mme Eduard Andre, both of which seem to be available widely for impulse buyers this month. If the winter has caught you out, use your ingenuity and try this type of replacement. It might even be an improvement.</p>

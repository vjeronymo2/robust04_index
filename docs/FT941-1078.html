			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Inchcape inches ahead after setback  -The week ahead The fashion for updating analysts on trading could have taken something of a dent after Inchcape's experience in January. When the international trading group - which announces 1993 results on Monday - met stockbroking analysts, some thought it had said nothing new of any great significance. But others came away from the meeting bearish and cut their forecasts. In the following days, the shares slumped nearly 70p from a high of 606p. Only recently have they begun to recover. All will be revealed in Monday's numbers. There is a wide range of forecasts, although most close Inchcape watchers range from Pounds 265m to Pounds 275m (up from Pounds 250.1m in 1992), excluding a Pounds 16m profit on the sale of a minority stake in Toyota GB to Toyota. Inchcape told analysts at the briefing that the second half had been similar to the first, when profits rose from Pounds 117.1m to Pounds 130.9m in spite of a Pounds 12m higher interest charge. Caradon, the building products group which last year bought RTZ's Pillar business for Pounds 800m, is expected to show a slight rise in pre-tax profits for 1993 - from Pounds 125.7m, to around Pounds 128m to Pounds 130m  -when it reports full year results on Wednesday. But there also will be an exceptional profit of Pounds 100m on the sale last year of the group's 25 per cent stake in Carnaud Metalbox, the packaging group. On Tuesday, it is the turn of Taylor Woodrow, and analysts expect pre-tax profits to have been between Pounds 20m and Pounds 25m compared with a re-stated loss of Pounds 94.5m for 1992, which included Pounds 51.5m of property provisions. Redland, Europe's biggest roof tile producer, reports on Thursday and is expected to have increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 221.5m in 1992 to Pounds 270m last year on a strong performance in Germany. City analysts are looking for Pearson's pre-tax profits to increase from Pounds 151m last year to between Pounds 201m and Pounds 215m for 1993 when the media group's results for the year to December are announced on Monday. The results could take some of the pressure off the share price, which has dropped from a high this year of 735p to 615p, with a particularly sharp drop in the past week. The share price fall does not seem to have been caused by any event and trading volumes have been low. Blenheim Group, the exhibition organiser whose shares have almost halved over the past year, is expected to report profits of between Pounds 42m and Pounds 45m for 1993 on Tuesday. That compares with profits of Pounds 49.7m for the 16 months to December 1992. Next, the UK fashion chain which has recovered strongly since running into difficulties at the end of the 1980s, is expected on Tuesday to provide further evidence of its resurgence with pre-tax profits of about Pounds 70m for the year to January 31, up from Pounds 38.9m last time. Next reported a very strong Christmas performance in January, with high street sales up a total of 18 per cent in the second half-year, and mail order sales through Next Directory up 9 per cent. Analysts are keen to hear if that improving performance has been sustained since the year-end. The dividend is expected to double from 2.5p to 5p.</p>

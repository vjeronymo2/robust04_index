			<p>The     following is the fourth of a series of editorial reports on  political Islam in Egypt.  These reports include summaries of all  articles, reports, interviews, commentaries and other islamic  affairs items that were published in the Cairo Arabic-language  weeklies 'AQIDATI, AL-NUR, AL-SHA'B, and AL-USRAH AL-'ARABIYAH.      This review covers the "January 1994" issue of AL-NUR, indicating  that the paper is apparently now published monthly, rather than  weekly, as only this and the Muslim Hegira date of 23 Rajab 1414  appear on the front page.  Contents of this issue include the  following:      Saudi Shura Council Opening Highlighted     Anti-Islamic Claims Against Ministry Upheld     News in Brief     Islamic Insurance Rules Discussed     Certifying Islamic Interpreters     Death for Apostates Dictated by Islam     Shaykh 'Abd-al-Rahman Defended     Islamic "Subversives" Beware     Saudi Shura Council Opening Highlighted      AL-NUR Board of Directors Chairman al-Hamzah Di'bis wrote, in a  lengthy factual two-page report, about the inauguration of the Shura  Council in Saudi Arabia to which he was invited.  His report  described the scene and covered the speeches delivered by the  chairman of the Shura Council and the Custodian of the Two Holy  Mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz.      Anti-Islamic Claims Against Ministry Upheld      Reporters Muhammad Hilmi and Ahmad Mustafa underscored views of a  number of ulema, supporting the "serious charges" leveled by  People's Assembly member Jalal Gharib 25 December against the  minister of culture that the ministry, through its publications and  cultural functions, "encourages deviation and spreads anarchy and  vice in Islamic society."      News in Brief      The General Assembly of the General Federation of Doctors "has  strongly rejected, for the third time, invitations by the Israeli  Health Ministry and Ben-Gurion University to conduct joint medical  research."  (page 1)      "Three People's Assembly members have called for legislation to  combat terrorism, which is threatening the country's security."  (page 1)      News from the Islamic world.  (page 2)      Issues of Islamic jurisprudence, individual interpretation, and  Islamic economy.  (page 4)      Cultural and literary issues.  (page 6)      Letters and other contributions by readers.  (page 7)      An announcement that "The Islamic Jawami' al-Khayr charitable  association in the 'Ali Bin-Abi-Talib Center in al-Haram provides  its services to the poor, particularly orphans, all over Egypt.  The society provides them with clothing, daily meals, and allows  them to stay in the center, which is supplied with modern  equipment." (page 8)      Islamic Insurance Rules Discussed      Dr. 'Abd-al-Muttalib 'Abduh, head of the Statistics and Insurance  Branch at the al-Azhar University's College of Commerce, was  interviewed, discussing shari'ah rules on contemporary insurance  systems, including commercial, cooperative, life, and social  insurance.  He noted that several Islamic conferences on insurance  were held and that they all ended with recommendations, but no  decisions.      Certifying Islamic Interpreters      Dr. Sabri 'Abd-al-Ra'uf, professor of jurisprudence at al-Azhar  University, was interviewed, explaining the qualifications needed  for someone to interpret the teachings of Islam.  He pointed out  that individual interpretation of Islam by qualified and highly  educated people will remain open "as long as there is life to prove  to the world that the Islamic shari'ah is suitable for all times and  places and is consistent with the time in which we live."      Death for Apostates Dictated in Islam      Writer Hasan Mahmud Khalil, speaking on the issues of death  sentences for apostates (hadd al-riddah) and religious freedom,  argued with those who claim that there is nothing called a death  sentence on apostates because there is no verse in the Koran that  calls for punishing a Muslim apostate on earth and that this  contradicts religious freedom.  He noted that while it is not  mentioned in the Koran, it is mentioned in the Sunnah (prophetic  sayings) and the Sunnah, he said, is the second source of  legislation and Islam after the Koran.  He added that Sunnah  contains various religious legal rulings.  There was a Sunnah that  confirmed what is contained in the Koran and another that explained  the Koran.  He further explained that "Islam protects rights and  freedoms, and the first of these freedoms is the freedom of belief  and expression.  No one is forced to abandon or change his religion.  A person can choose which religion to believe and accept, but if he  adopts Islam willingly, he accepts its rules and submits to its  obligations.  He will be asked about every shortcoming."  Khalil  also said that "the punishment for apostasy was legalized to  safeguard religion, ensure its course, deter those who wish to enter  Islam to achieve certain purposes and then return to their  infidelity, and purge society of such hypocrites and exploiters of  religion."  He concluded that apostates are more dangerous to Islam  than non-Muslims because they distort religion and deceive many  people who are not familiar with Islam."      Shaykh 'Abd-al-Rahman Defended      Writer Muntasir al-Zayyat argued, in an article entitled "Umar  'Abd-al-Rahman; The Other Side," that Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman is being  held in the United States on political rather than legal grounds.  He said that the indictment issued by the federal court in New York  in the case of the World Trade Center explosion on 4 September did  not include the name of Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, although much  media clamor was raised at the time.  This, al-Zayyat said, "opens  the way for his possible release soon."      Al-Zayyat then recalled that the U.S. Administration several  months ago wanted Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman to leave the country, saying  that his entry into the United States was improper.  Describing this  as "ridiculous" and "surprising," he said that if Shaykh 'Umar's  entry visa, which he received in Khartoum, was wrong, then why did  no one find fault with his previous 1985 and 1987 entries to the  United States?  He further argued that the U.S. Administration  wanted to get Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman out and could not explicitly  express that; therefore, it said that he violated immigration laws  and began looking for a country to take him.  The problem became  more complicated, al-Zayyat said, when the Egyptian Government asked  for his extradition and the prime minister of Afghanistan agreed to  receive him.  This was unacceptable to the U.S. Administration, he  said, adding that the day when 'Abd-al-Rahman's lawyer officially  requested that the shaykh be allowed to leave for Kabul, he was  officially charged to prevent him from traveling there.  "Therefore,  the problem is not governed by legal considerations, but political.  If Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman was treated according to law, he would always  emerge victorious."      The writer then tried to shed more light on the "critical and  fabricated problem" of Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman.  He said: "The man has  always paid for his daring beliefs and views."  His freedom has been  restricted since the death of former President Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir,  when he called from the pulpit that no prayers should be made for  President 'Abd-al-Nasir.      Al-Zayyat then reviewed Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman's struggle for his  beliefs in Egypt since that time, noting that he was subjected to  ugly" torture during his imprisonment from 1981 to 1984 and was  insulted and defamed by "all the media." The writer added that when  he left prison, he was strong and continued to adhere to his beliefs  and call for the application of the shari'ah.  He was threatened by  former Interior Ministers Zaki Badr and 'Abd-al-Halim Musa and, as a  result, left Egypt and has not since returned.      In further defense of Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman, the writer said: "In  the case of Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman, the law worked in his favor.  However, the law now is not respected in Egypt by those who make it.  The problem is being tackled on a political basis, and the political  situation today is hostile to Shaykh 'Umar and all those who follow  in his footsteps."      Al-Zayyat continued:  "The proceedings for the trial of Dr. 'Umar  'Abd-al-Rahman are being resumed in al-Fayyum at a time when such  measures were suspended in New York.  It is Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-  Rahman's fate to pay the price for his adherence to his beliefs and  his Islamic call."      Islamic "Subversives" Beware      Dr. Sa'd al-Hilwani, history lecturer at the al-Azhar  University's Arabic language college, warned of attempts by  subversive elements to undermine the Muslim religion.  He also  warned against moral and religious degeneration as a result of  immoral literature, referring in this regard to the question  submitted by Jalal Gharib, an independent deputy of the People's  Assembly, to the minister of culture on the issue.

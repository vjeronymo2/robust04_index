			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Xiao Wentao (5135 2429 3447): "The Social </F> Effects of the Newly Emerging Stratum of Wealthy People and  Relevant Reflections" -- Edited by Shen Guanbao (3038 7070 1405)  and Li Ling (2621 5107)]    [Excerpts] Speaking of their positive effects, the  emergence of a stratum of rich people demonstrates the most  realistic aspect of the party's policy to have the people attain  a state of prosperity and to advance toward a state of common  prosperity and abundance for all. It is indeed a historical  event of breakthrough nature. Not long after establishment of  New China, the CPC had pronounced its move in the direction of  common prosperity and abundance for all, and for this purpose  had instituted its thoroughgoing reforms. However, due to the  restraints of the traditional economic system and the influences  of the absolute egalitarianism engendered by manual labor, also  the additional vigilance against the social dichotomy of the Old  China, it was never possible, in this question of how to achieve  common prosperity and abundance for all, to at least arrive at a  policy of allowing one part of the population gain prosperity  ahead of others. To allow pluralistic economic components  outside of the public ownership system and distribution patterns  other than the one of distribution according to work had been  absolutely taboo. The practice was that of the so-called  "egalitarianism and indiscriminate transfer of resources" and  "chopping off the tails of capitalism." Under these  circumstances, it was impossible to allow one part of the  population attain prosperity ahead of others, and it was even  more out of the question to speak of common prosperity and  abundance for all. Only after the Third Plenary Session of the  11th CPC Central Committee did it happen that Comrade Deng  Xiaoping for the first time put forward: "As regards our  economic policy, it is my opinion that we should allow some  districts, some enterprises, and some people to gain larger  incomes and enjoy better lives ahead of others, because of their  achievements attained in hard work and with great exertions...  to make it possible for the Chinese people of all nationalities  throughout the entire country to gain prosperity and abundance  in a comparatively short time." We can therefore conclude that  the emergency of the stratum of wealthy people, and the process  that allows them to develop and grow in strength, is also part  of the process of that would allow first a limited portion of  the population to attain prosperity before others, and to delay  to later days prosperity and abundance for the majority of the  people, as this process is also the successful practice and  vivid demonstration of the party's policy of achieving  nationwide prosperity in due course.    We can also assert that by their emergency the stratum of  wealthy people is setting an example for those that have not yet  attained prosperity, and that they thereby are exerting a widely  spreading stimulating influence. For the majority of China's  citizens, coming from the traditional economic system, the  decision to involve themselves in the treacherous ocean of the  market economy requires not only an extreme measure of courage,  but also that they undergo a process of a rather arduous  apprenticeship. In this respect, those wealthy ones, who have  courageously opened up new paths and who have swiftly raced  ahead toward prosperity, are thus playing an exemplary role by  their actually achieving wealth. They are setting an example to  emulate and are thereby motivating and helping a growing number  of others to advance too toward prosperity and abundance.    Looking at the negative aspects, there is first, that among  the stratum of the wealthy people some got rich in unreasonable  and unlawful ways. They either took advantage of loopholes of  policy or acquired wealth illegally, which then directly stirred  up confusion in the social distribution order and gave rise to  serious injustices in distribution. Most conspicuous examples of  such are:    One, some specially gifted and naturally talented people,  such as star singers, star athletes, etc., although capable of  providing people with spiritual products and spiritual  enjoyment, or winning honors for their motherland, acquire huge  wealth once they become famous. It makes people really wonder  whether that is reasonable or legitimate. Then there are also  loopholes in the country's taxation policy, all that has people  inevitably consider such cases as incidents of inequitable  distribution.    Two, with the development of private economy, a group of  people came into being who primarily operated illegally and  conspired to reap huge profits; these people were indeed  successful in acquiring great wealth in this way in a short time.    Three, by the method of trading power against money, some  appropriated to themselves large amounts of public property and  caused many public assets to become lost. This is at the present  time the most serious instance of injustice in social  distribution. Their customary methods of misappropriations are  mainly:    "Profiteering by means of undue official approvals to  certain  documents." Some people specialize in the resale of import and  export licenses, and once a sale is successful, cash is diverted  from the enterprises into their own pockets.    "Illegal profiteering by means of the price differentials"  has some lawless elements take advantage of the dual-track  pricing system during the period of change-over in systems. They  exploit personal relationships, go by the backdoor, accept  kickbacks, fraudulently sell parity-priced means of production,  and shift most of the financial encumbrances on to the  enterprises.    "Illegal speculating in real estate" has some people,  relying  on power or with the help of corrupt officials, buying up land  at cheap prices, then drive up land price before they sell it  again, deriving huge profits from such speculation.    "Speculating in shares" has some people take advantage of  the  fact that the management of the new stock markets is not yet up  to standards, as they misuse public funds to speculate in  personal stocks, transfer corporate stocks to individual  persons, and there are also cases that before original issue  stocks come into the market, they are privately shared out among  related parties or placed in red gift envelopes and presented to  certain people as gifts.    Second, some nouveaux riches, who had easily amassed great  wealth within a short time, do not use it for investment in  productive fields, but squander it wantonly and wastefully,  creating an antisocial consumption that by far exceeds the  present level of productive forces and seriously pollutes the  general social atmosphere. In actual life, there are now many  cases of rich men competing with each other in wealth,  ostentatiously displaying their wealth, engaging in reckless  gambling, visiting prostitutes, and using narcotic drugs. Even  though these are not widely prevailing consumption habits among  the stratum of the wealthy, these abnormal consumption  phenomena--throwing money around like dirt and letting money  flow like water--have already created an extremely bad  impression among the general public.    Third, it is precisely these illegal acquisitions of wealth  that have led to serious injustices in the distribution field,  have fomented discontent among a considerable portion of the  population, and have caused psychological instability of a  societal character to appear. Although people's incomes and  living standards have generally improved in the 10-odd years of  reform and opening to the outside world, and people have a  greater psychological tolerance than before, there is also this  problem that must be faced squarely: The injustices in the  social distribution that have occurred in the course of reform  and opening up are felt as a daily increasing psychological  pressure by many members of society. Due to these injustices in  distribution, majority of personnel on wages and salaries, and  the workers in agriculture feel that the disparity in incomes  and the gap between rich and poor is much too large. They have  the strong impression that they are being deprived. There is  presently also the factor of the large-scale currency inflation,  which is an additional direct threat to the consumption level  and developmental demands of one portion of the population,  making them feel that there is no moral justice as things are at  the present time. This will inevitably lead to even greater  discontent in an even wider circle of people, and will affect  stability throughout the entire society.    Fourth, the process of irrational and unlawful enrichment of  some of the nouveaux riches has emboldened more and more people  to try to also get rich quickly by means that would violate law  and discipline or would even constitute criminal acts. In the  face of the new situation, with its rapidly growing economy and  continuously rising social consumption, the huge wealth of some  of those "moneybags," and their immense consumption, has already  bestirred some people, irresistibly, not to take things lying  down, but to rather think of ways and means to avail themselves  of loopholes in the policy, working out all kinds of schemes to  embezzle public property, and also some private property, or  trying, overtly or covertly, to get high incomes to which they  are not rightly entitled. What is particular cause for anxiety  is that some people, to get rich quickly, will not shrink from  boldly taking great risks and from even stooping to commit  crimes.</p>

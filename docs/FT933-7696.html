			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Oil companies resume Azeri talks NEGOTIATIONS have re-opened in London between a group of eight foreign oil companies and officials from Azerbaijan over a Dollars 9bn (Pounds 6bn) oilfield development in the Caspian Sea. The Azeri government is understood to have agreed that the project be discussed as a joint development between the companies, rather than holding separate negotiations for the three fields, which are estimated to contain 4.5bn barrels of oil. The talks had been put on ice during the political upheaval in Azerbaijan in June when the republic's leader, Mr Abulfaz Elchibey, fled the capital and was replaced by Mr Gaidar Aliyev, an official from the Brezhnev era. Mr Aliyev officially relaunched the negotiating process 10 days ago in Baku, although the oil companies had been talking to Azeri officials in New York in the interim. Mr Aliyev said he would like to see a deal agreed by the end of September, but many details must still be finalised. The Azeri delegation in London is led by Mr Marat Manafov, an Azeri businessman with strong links to the west. He is being advised by seven oil industry experts from the US, Canada and the UK. The appointment of Mr Manafov has encouraged some of the oil company representatives, who now have a single point of contact with the Azeris with a mandate to secure a deal. Mr Aliyev is understood to have offered either to return a Dollars 70m pre-payment made by the companies or to offset it against future costs. The companies are also talking about the route for an export pipeline. Four possible plans are under negotiation. The companies involved in the talks include: Amoco, British Petroleum, Statoil, Pennzoil, Ramco, Turkish Petroleum, Unocal and McDermott.</p>

			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Books: Jaw, jaw about war, war COLLISION OF EMPIRES: BRITAIN INTHREE WORLD WARS 1793-1945 by AD  Harvey Hambledon Press Pounds 45, 784 pages COLLISION of Empires is not one book but three. Its sections - on the wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France, and the First and the Second World Wars - are separate works. They all just happen to be about long wars since 1793 in which Britain was involved. The book lacks two of the characteristics necessary for a contemporary historical bestseller: copious illustrations and a price under Pounds 25. But it has the rest. It is very long, very readable, very detailed, crammed with footnotes evidencing colossal research; and it purports to address a 'big question': how did Britain's experience of the three wars compare? Mr Harvey barely begins to answer that question, but his lucidity and erudition are not to be gainsaid. As an account of the inter-connections between politics, diplomacy and military strategy in three European wars since 1793, his book is masterly, full of insight and sympathy. The minutiae  -pages, for instance, on the origins of the Machine Gun Corps and why Sir John French was not sacked earlier as commander of the British Expeditionary Force - can be oppressive, but Harvey's grasp of constitutions, dynasties, strategy, technology, national accounts, and more besides, is remarkable, dazzling professional and bedtime readers alike. Harvey has an eye for the vivid quotation and cutting aside. After a survey of the chronic incompetence of pre-1914 Habsburg administration, he remarks, 'only an Austrian archduke could have fallen victim to a second assassination attempt in one day.' Tannenberg, Ypres, Verdun, Caporetto, the Somme, 'toll the passing of an age that was unprepared for its own demise and died hard.' Stalingrad was 'only the nemesis of a consistently hubristic style of campaigning.' The hubris, and the insulation of military and political elites from the horrors of all three wars, are deftly intertwined with passages on the technicalities of tanks, gas, average earnings and high-definition radar. 'Generally,' Harvey opens one chapter, 'the military favoured new or improved ways of killing people.' Like the fusilier who wrote back from the trenches of the Somme, 'If hell is any worse I would not like to go to it'; or the First World War air squadrons in which the mention of casualties or enquiries about colleagues missing at mealtimes were forbidden; or the hundreds of German youths whose names are inscribed on gravestones in Bergfriedhof, Heidelberg, 'the gazetteer of Nazi advance, retirement and collapse.' But when it comes to the 'big question', one looks in vain for an answer. There is no systematic comparison of the three wars, even by way of conclusion. Indeed, it is not clear why the war against revolutionary and Napoleonic France is included at all. A three-page introduction says it is on the grounds that 'in a sense, at least as regards Britain, it belongs to the era of 20th-century warfare', while 'the assumptions behind the decision for war in 1914 and 1939 will be more clearly understood if the earlier war is taken into account.' In a sense, yes; in many others, no. As for the assumptions, the evolution of post-unification Germany, the Irish question, and the exigencies of late-Victorian and Edwardian imperialism would add more clarity to the decision for war in 1914 than pages on George III as a national symbol, or paper roubles in circulation in the 1790s. For a book ostensibly about empires, there is remarkably little about empire, either at the theoretical level or by way of description of the imperial dimensions to the three conflicts under examination. Much of the book is not even loosely related to the theme of Britain in three world wars. Calling them 'parallel cases' and suggesting that they might give us a 'clearer idea' of British motivation does little to make relevant lengthy sections on why Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and the US did or did not declare war in 1914. Ditto the fascinating discussion of the varieties of fascism, and of 'isolated ideologues' of similar ilk in Belgium and France. 'Aspects of the three wars which tickle the author's fancy' would be a more apt sub-title. Only in the final paragraph is there a hint of an over-view, when Harvey half-heartedly invokes a cycle from 'national wars fought without national leadership, as in 1793-1815' to 'wars fought by national leaders determined to survive in their bunkers while the nation as such perishes in the nuclear holocaust outside.' But who was 'the nation' in 1793, and how was it able to go to war for 22 years without its 'national leaders'? True, Harvey is somewhat confused about the identity of the leaders. At one point William Pitt is 'a royal servant surviving by royal favour'; later he is 'no royal stooge' and only 'ostensibly' George III's servant. But whether George III, Pitt or Wellington were at the helm, it would be intriguing to know how the French wars are supposed to have been fought without them. To be fair, Harvey gives a response to such carping in the concluding sentence. 'We will know better,' he informs us, 'where we are going when we have got there, and a book like this one cannot be more than an attempt at an interim report.' If the interim report takes 756 pages, keep a retirement or two free for the final solution.</p>

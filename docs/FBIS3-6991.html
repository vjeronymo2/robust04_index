			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Singapore, March 23 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- The ASEAN  Regional Forum (ARF) inaugural meeting should emphasize common  areas instead of bringing in contentious issues, Malaysian  Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi said Tuesday.    Highlighting the issues right from the start might not be  good as it could relate to the position of a particular country,  he added.    The country may ask why should it attend the meeting if it  were to be the subject of criticism ... Then it might lose  interest, he told a press conference at the end of a two-day  official visit to Singapore.    The 18-member ARF created during the ASEAN ministerial  meeting (AMM) here last year is scheduled to hold its first  session in Bangkok in July.    It is made up of ASEAN, its dialogue partners, and regional  powers.    I think the first forum should give opportunities for  general  discussion on the subject of confidence-building measures, said  Abdullah who was here at the invitation of his Singapore  counterpart, Prof. S. Jayakumar.    But, certainly, we wouldn't want to stop anybody from  raising  questions which may be sensitive, he added, saying he did not  rule out the probability.    He said he did not think there would be difficulty in  handling such issues because this is not going to be a meeting  of strangers.    Abdullah said the ARF was an important forum and, naturally,  Malaysia wanted it to succeed.</p>

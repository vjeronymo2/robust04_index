			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / International Press Review: Russia, Ukraine in war of words  -Crimea Far from cheering on nashi (our side), Russia's newspapers, like its people, have been categorical in blaming 'politicians' for the past week's stand-off between Ukraine and its Russian-dominated peninsula of Crimea. 'Politicians are doing everything so that holidaymakers sunbathe on barricades,' said the liberal daily Izvestia, just as Kiev, Moscow, and Crimea, traditionally Russia's summer holiday playground, swapped threats over the Crimean parliament's decision to restore a secessionist constitution. The official military newspaper, Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star), called for peace with a front page story headlined: 'Will the Politicians Stop at the Danger Zone?' Admittedly, most of the criticism was aimed at politicians in Ukraine, with many commentators noting the influence of elections a month away. Despite popular resentment at Mr Nikita Khrushchev's decision to donate Crimea to Ukraine in 1954, Russia's papers refused to give Yuri Meshkov, the maverick Crimean leader who wants reunification with Russia, total support. According to Izvestia, he was to be held responsible for crying wolf on troop movements in Crimea, and undermining its livelihood by scaring away Russian tourists. The mass-circulation weekly Argumenty i Fakty argued that the former KGB and Red Army, with the collapse of the former Soviet Union, had their own reasons for wanting the crisis to degenerate into war. 'Many officers still think of themselves as belonging to a single, although temporarily divided, system. They hope that a war in the Crimea will push Ukraine towards a gradual restoration of common statehood with Russia and that other ex-Soviet republics will follow suit,' the paper said. With typical cheekiness, Komsomolskaya Pravda, the former Communist youth daily, took a more light-hearted approach. Noting the way the dollar exchange rate in Crimea soared and then fell in a matter of days, it said the whole crisis had simply made currency speculators rich. It also speculated that the only reason Kiev had not deployed more armoured vehicles was that most of the equipment inherited from the Red Army had fallen into disrepair. Most regional and local newspapers in the former Soviet Union have yet to find the confidence to comment forcefully on events: the overwhelming majority print government statements and versions of events unedited and unglossed. The Crimean press follows this tradition closely. A typical edition of the main daily Krymskie Izvestiya (Crimean News) - published by the Crimean supreme soviet - has press releases and regulations on the front page, with bland features on the other three. Last Wednesday's edition had as its main story a transcription of the press conference given by Mr Sergei Tsekov, the supreme soviet chairman  - under the headline: 'We are working without fuss' - which, as a response to a region accused by the Ukrainian government of unlawful secession and provoking civil war, appears to lack urgency. Ukraine's press, still largely under state control, devoted much space to reprinting presidential decrees on asserting authority over Crimea's militia, and parliamentary resolutions giving Crimea 10 days to change its mind and rescind its 'illegal' constitution. As usual, the news was two days old at the time of printing. The singular anti-establishment paper, Nezavisimost, led a crusade condemning Russian and Ukrainian television for, respectively, biased and absent coverage. It attacked Russia's Ostankino Television for highlighting false rumours of Ukrainian military deployments. The paper charged Ostankino with 'artistically editing' an interview with Mr Vitaly Radetsky, the Ukrainian defence minister, which 'gave the impression that poor little Crimea is choking in the grips of the Ukrainian monster.' However, the outspoken paper lambasted Ukrainian Television for burying the story as an 'insignificant matter,' instead of providing full explanation and commentary. In Nezavisimost's opinion column, a Ukrainian MP lamented that Crimean negotiations in Kiev last Wednesday ended without a concrete resolution confirming Crimea's status as part of Ukraine. Crimea's apparent reason for not agreeing was that their parliamentary delegation 'lacked authority,' wrote Mr Yuri Karmazin, a Ukrainian MP. The mainstream press' condemnation of Russia's widely- perceived role in stirring up troubles in Crimea was more subtle. Kiev's leading newspaper, Kievskiye Vedomosti, displayed two carefully chosen quotes side by side. It quoted Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, noting that the US 'recognises and highly values the responsible and peaceful position of Ukraine.' The paper then had a Russian MP, Mr Konstantin Zatulin, saying that 'the tension around Crimea is connected not with the peninsula's politics, but with who'll be president of Ukraine.' In a separate story, Kievskiye Vedomosti drew an alarming parallel between Crimea's developments and the 1992 bloody civil war which took place between Moldova and its Slavic-oriented, separatist region of Transdneister. It noted that that 'Tiraspol (Trans - dneister's capital) also began with establishing its own power ministries.' But this titbit was buried in the last paragraph of page 13. For all the grim warnings in the Russian and Ukrainian press, more amusing than anything else this week, however, was President Boris Yeltsin's reported response to a barrage of criticism from his Ukrainian counterpart, Mr Leonid Kravchuk. Projecting his new-found image as father of the nation, Mr Yeltsin told Russians that despite all the fuss, it would be perfectly safe to go on holiday to the Crimea this summer after all.</p>

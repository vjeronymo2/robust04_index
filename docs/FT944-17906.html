			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Indian minister faces scandal inquiry India's criminal board of investigation (CBI) said yesterday it was continuing to investigate claims that a cabinet minister was involved in an Rs1.32bn (Pounds 26.7m) illegal financing scheme in a case arising from the 1992 Bombay securities market scandal. Mr B Shankaranand, the health and welfare minister, is accused of having authorised the diversion of funds from the state-owned oil industry development board (OIDB) to the syndicate bank, a banking institution, so that it could be, illegally, invested in the stock market. Mr Shankaranand was oil minister and OIDB chairman at the time of the alleged fund transfers in 1992. He denies any wrong-doing. The scandal centred on the illegal transfer of funds from banks into the stock market in order to try to make speculative profits, which were shared out among the banks, stockbrokers and bank clients, including private companies and state-owned enterprises. Details of OIDB's transactions were published in a report of a joint parliamentary committee into the scandal last year. It concluded Mr Shankaranand had violated prudential norms in his supervision of OIDB's financial investments. Mr Shankaranand's denials were included in a government report published in response to the parliamentary report. Paul Taylor adds: More than half the banks implicated in the Bombay securities scandal have paid their fines, according to the Reserve Bank of India. The Indian central bank, which earlier this week imposed new penalties on three more small banks, said 14 banks had so far paid the fines, which were imposed for alleged breaches of its rules on securities transactions. In July the central bank imposed fines totalling Rs1.47bn on 20 commercial banks, including foreign banks, which were severely criticised in a parliamentary report into the scandal published in December and were held liable for the bulk - Rs1.24bn - of the fines.</p>

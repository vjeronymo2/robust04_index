			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Wage increases lowest on record in main industries Wage increases in main industries last year were the lowest on record, reflecting the protracted economic slump, the labour ministry said yesterday, Kyodo reports. The ministry, citing a survey on the basic wage structure, said monthly salaries last June averaged Y281,100 (Pounds 1,850), up 2.1 per cent over a year earlier. The growth rate was the lowest since the collecting of statistics began in 1976, the ministry said.

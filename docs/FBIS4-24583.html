			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column by Jen Hui-wen (0117 </F> 1979 2429), written in Beijing on 25 May 1994: "China's  Strategic Considerations in Developing Sino-Russian Relations"]    [Text] Striving for a peaceful environment favorable for  economic development is an important principle upheld by Deng  Xiaoping in foreign relations while implementing the reform and  opening up policy on the mainland of China. In accordance with  this, China has all along paid special attention to maintaining  and developing relations of good-neighborliness, friendship,  mutual benefit, and cooperation with the countries on its  periphery. In its relations with big countries, China has not  only upheld improving and developing Sino-U.S. relations on the  basis of the three joint communiques, but has also in the past  two years paid great attention to developing relations of  friendship and cooperation with Russia. Russian President  Yeltsin's visit to China at the end of the year before last,  Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's visit to China a few days  ago, and the scheduled visit to Russia in the fall of Jiang  Zemin, CPC general secretary and concurrently state president,  are new developments in Sino-Russian relations.  <H5>  China's Party, Government, and Military Support Sino-Russian </H5> Friendship    As informed sources in Beijing disclosed, the development of  good-neighborly and friendly relations with Russia has won  extensive support in the party, the government, and the  military, including some party, government, and military elders.  The reasons are: 1) Because of the disintegration of the  former USSR, disputes over ideology which may lead to tense  state-to-state relations between China and Russia no longer  exist. 2) Since both China and Russia are carrying out reform,  they need cooperation. 3) There is a history of friendship and  cooperation between the Chinese and Russian peoples and the  former USSR gave assistance to China in its construction in the  1950's. 4) The establishment of relations of comprehensive  cooperation between China and Russia is in the interests of the  two countries and the two peoples and can contribute to curbing  hegemony and power politics. 5) Sino-Russian cooperation can  contain U.S. hegemonic strategy toward China. 6) Russia's  advanced science, technology, and military equipment are  precisely what China needs in its economy and national defense.    China's State Council has taken a positive attitude toward  the development of relations of cooperation between China and  Russia and not long ago worked out a three-year plan on  providing aid for Russia in terms of light industry, foodstuffs,  and textiles.    Out of consideration of the necessity of upgrading the  equipment of the three armed services of China, at the beginning  of March the Ministry of National Defense and the General Staff  Headquarters put forward to the CPC Central Committee, the State  Council, and the Central Military Commission a plan for  strengthening cooperation between the armed forces of China and  Russia. The plan includes organizing regular mutual visits of  high-level personalities of the armed forces, carrying out  regular exchanges in military equipment and technology, carrying  out regular exchanges of information on the security of the two  countries, exchanging cadets of military academies, setting up  associations for promoting cooperation and friendship, and so on.    Diplomats in Beijing hold that China has energetically  developed its relations with Russia mainly out of the strategic  consideration of contending with U.S. pressure on China each  year on the issue of most-favored-nation trading status. As  observed from the angle of the diplomatic strategy of  "consolidating the periphery," Sino-Russian friendship and  cooperation will benefit China's politics, economy, and military.  <H5>  Deng Xiaoping's Tactics Toward Sino-Russian Relations </H5>   However, according to informed sources, Deng Xiaoping has  unique views as to the relations which should be established  between China and Russia.    On the eve of Chinese Premier Li Peng's visit in the middle  of April to countries of the CIS which separated from the former  USSR, including Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and  Kazakhstan in Central Asia, Deng Xiaoping mentioned to members  of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC  Central Committee: "It is right to develop comprehensive  relations with Russia, but it is necessary to have more  observation and it is not advisable to be impatient to establish  partnership or treaty relations. We uphold opening up and  multilateral cooperation, but do not depend on (the other side);  nor should we worry too much about what new relations will be  established between the United States, Europe, and Russia.  Russia has its own strategic plan. I think for quite a long  time to come, there will not be major conflicts between China  and Russia. Regarding economic aid to Russia, we should do what  we are capable of and should openly state that in doing so,  China is not aiming at a third country and does not seek any  interests of its own."    As diplomats in Beijing point out, Deng Xiaoping's idea of  pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace had already  fully manifested itself at the end of the 1980's and the  beginning of the 1990's. While talking about the international  situation and China's policy toward it with several high-level  political figures of the CPC on 4 September 1989, Deng said  three things: "First, observing coolly; second, securing our  position; third, dealing with things calmly." He laid special  emphasis on "the necessity of keeping cool, keeping cool, and  keeping cool, and of engrossing ourselves in doing a good job of  attending to our own affairs." In accordance with the three  things put forward by Deng, China's diplomacy stood the test of  a changeable international situation in which Eastern Europe  experienced drastic changes and the USSR disintegrated, and was  able to resist the pressure of sanctions imposed by the West.  Talking about China's diplomacy with some high-level political  figures of the CPC again on 14 December 1990, Deng put forward  that China should "accomplish something" in foreign affairs and  said: "Unpredictable factors in the international situation are  now numerous and contradictions become more and more  unexpected." "Some countries of the Third World hope that China  will act as the head. However, in no way should we act as the  head and this is a fundamental national policy. We are  incapable of acting as the head and we do not have sufficient  strength for that. There is no advantage in acting as the head  because we may lose the initiative in many aspects if we do so.  China will stand on the side of the Third World forever. China  will never seek hegemony and China will never act as the head.  However, we cannot accomplish nothing on international issues  and we should still accomplish something. What should we  accomplish? I think we should energetically promote the  establishment of a new international political and economic  order. We fear nobody, but we offend nobody. We handle affairs  in accordance with the five principles of peaceful coexistence  and we are firm in principle and stand." In these years, China  has all along maneuvered among various groupings and developed  in a flexible manner in the international arena in accordance  with Deng Xiaoping's diplomatic ideas.  <H5>  China Wants To Accomplish Something in the World </H5>   According to informed sources, in handling its relations  with  Russia, China of course will not deviate from the guidance of  Deng Xiaoping's diplomatic ideas. To be specific, China follows  four principles:    1. Uphold good neighborliness, friendship, and peaceful  coexistence;    2. Develop mutual-benefit cooperation, promote common  prosperity;    3. Respect the choice of the people of each country and do  not interfere in each other's internal affairs;    4. Respect independence and sovereignty and promote regional  stability.    However, what has attracted people's attention is that  people  in charge of China's diplomatic, economic, and trade circles  said a few days ago that China hoped the Russian prime  minister's visit to China could promote development in depth of  the relations between the two countries. This may imply that  although it "will never act as a head" in the international  arena, China wants to "accomplish something."    When the Cold War ended, most people thought the big  triangular relations between China, the United States, and  Russia no long existed. As a matter of fact, the end of the  Cold War only implied the end of nuclear confrontation between  the two superpowers, but it did not imply that the differences  in interests and contradictions between countries would also  disappear. So long as the differences in interests and  contradictions between countries remain among China, the United  States, and Russia, the strategic interaction relations among  the three countries will remain. If China can make good use of  such strategic interaction relations, and develop Sino-Russian  relations, such a move will be conducive to the political  stability of Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang in China and to  preventing chaos in Mongolia and Central Asia, and will raise  China's position in the big triangular relations of China, the  United States, and Russia. This is because after Russia widens  its diplomatic gap with the United States, it will inevitably  draw close to China, and this will increase China's chips in  bargaining with the United States, compelling the latter to keep  its eyes on the overall pattern of global strategy in  considering its policy toward China, instead of merely making  use of the lever of human rights. In this way, the issue of  giving most-favored-nation trading status to China can be solved  more easily, and the United States will also attach greater  importance to the strategic position of U.S.-Chinese relations  and will not lightly have confrontation with China.</p>

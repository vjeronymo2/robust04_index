			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: These funds have their uses but . . . - John Authers considers the complexities of convertibles THIS could be the year for convertibles. Fixed interest investments are in vogue, and offer some security, while many believe that the equity market should have a strong year. Convertibles, securities offered by companies which can at a later date be converted into ordinary or preference shares, might seem to be the ideal, if rather complex, investment instrument for today. But no fund management houses have promoted convertibles funds, in spite of the attention given to gilts and international bonds. Performance tables show that the convertibles investment story is not as seductive as it seems. Over ten years, the tables show that the average convertibles unit trust has grown by 115.76 per cent in the 10 years to January 1, according to Micropal (offer-to-bid, income reinvested). This is not far our of line with gilts and fixed interest, which averaged 120.57 per cent growth over the same period. But over periods starting since the stock market crash of October 1987, underperformance by convertibles has been marked. Over the last five years, gilts and fixed interest averaged 38.76 per cent, while convertibles registered 12.73 per cent. Over three years, the figures are 26 per cent versus 0.52 per cent. How can convertibles have underperformed so badly? The answer lies in the crash of October 1987. As John Plumpton, fund manager of the Prolific Convertible &amp; Gilt unit trust says: 'In 1988, companies wanted to issue new equity but they couldn't because prices were so depressed and investors wanted income. So there was a massive issuance of convertibles. They were mainly used to finance acquisitions right at the top of the Lawson boom and they were mostly the 1980s go-go stocks which have since gone off the rails.' Charles Park, fund manager with Framlington, says most of the big convertible issues in the late 1980s involved optimistic predators swallowing prey at the top of the market. Rather than issue conventional debt, they paid for their purchases in convertibles. This gave the predators immediate cost savings since yields on convertibles are lower than on normal loans. With hindsight, not all the acquisitions look well-founded. Park mentions convertibles issued by British Aerospace to fund its purchase of Arlington Securities, British &amp; Commonwealth to buy Atlantic Computers, Blue Circle in buying Birmid Qualcast, and Ratners in buying H Samuel. Other companies using convertibles to fund acquisitions included Evode and Amec. The share price of many of these acquirers did not perform to expectations. This automatically dampened convertible performance. In some cases, such as B &amp; C, the companies crashed altogether. By 1990, the convertibles market was afflicted by both over-supply, and a disproportionate number of weak stocks. When the equity market recovered, therefore, convertibles failed to follow. The other important factor pushing the convertible market is the 'premium' which must be paid to convert into a normal share. Convertibles yield more than shares, so they will normally cost more. If their price rises, it is harder to gain an easy extra income by switching from ordinary and preference shares into convertibles. This technical factor lies behind the other problem afflicting the market. According to Park: 'People running high income funds found a year ago that they were in stocks which might cut their dividends, and that they could push up their yield by switching into convertible preference shares. In some companies that could be done almost on a like for like basis.' The problem is that share prices in these companies have fallen while the convertibles have held firm. That means that fund managers now need to pay a premium to gain the extra yield from convertibles. As Park puts it: 'To that extent I would say convertibles are not as attractive now as they were a year ago.' Not all fund managers agree with this. According to Val Rodway, of Allied Dunbar, there are several attractively priced convertibles on the market. The supply problem is that there are often no convertibles available in sectors which the equities research team recommends, she says. However, a pickup in market activity this year should lead to a recovery in new issues, she suggests. A final argument advanced for convertibles is their yield. Half the convertibles unit trusts are currently yielding in excess of 7.5 per cent, which is healthy. That yield could be an adequate cushion for investors nervous about prospects for a genuine recovery. So is it worth investing in convertibles? The last five years show that they are not the no-lose bets which they might appear. But the sharpest effects of the late 1980s appear to have passed. The sector averaged an adequate total return after charges of 11.55 per cent in 1992. They should not be overlooked, particularly by those busy transferring money out of uncompetitive building society accounts. Some of this money could go into convertibles - but not all. It is hard to justify more than a small weighting for these instruments.  ---------------------------------------              BEST PERFORMING            CONVERTIBLES FUNDS               OVER 10 YEARS  ---------------------------------------                               % growth  --------------------------------------- Framlington Convertible         177.18 Prolific Conv &amp; Gilt            126.59 Allied Dun Conv &amp; Gilt          109.81 CU Fixed &amp; Convertible           49.44 Average                         115.76  ---------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------              BEST PERFORMING            CONVERTIBLES FUNDS               OVER 3 YEARS  ---------------------------------------                               % growth  --------------------------------------- Allied Dun Conv &amp; Gilt           21.73 Edinburgh Convertible            10.34 Baring Convertibles               8.36 CU Fixed &amp; Convertible            2.93 Average                           0.52  ---------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESS VOTES NO ON PAY RAISE  </P> <P> I was glad to see Congress vote against its pay raise. It restored my faith in  the "by the people, for the people" theory of government. Congress does listen.  </P> <P> I do believe, however, that our servants in government are underpaid.  </P> <P> The solution? A 50% raise in pay by raising your hand and saying aye? Well,  that seems a little unrealistic. But why not that same percentage spread over  four or five years? 12.5% a year is much easier to swallow, for me anyway.  </P> <P> It seems time is the real reason. Some members wouldn't see the full amount of  increase. But what better way to show the voters their true motivations in  seeking public office?  </P> <P> Maybe that is the real problem.  </P> <P> ERIC C. NORDLING  </P> <P> Cardiff by the Sea  </P></p>

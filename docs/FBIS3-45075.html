Zhu Kaixuan, minister in charge of the State Education  Commission, said in a national telephone meeting on education  here today that, if programs go according to this plan, China  will be able to give all its grown-ups the ability to read.    For several years, China has strictly and firmly rescued  about four million from illiteracy annually.    The illiteracy rate for the total population has dropped  from  80 percent in 1949 to 16 percent today, accounting for the young  and adults.    "Elementary education will be the key for all national  education in the coming years," Zhu said. "We will map out  measures to help poor regions popularize compulsory education  and revise the current examination methods on anti-illiteracy  progress."    About 90 percent of Chinese illiterates are rural people,  with the majority being females living in poverty-stricken areas.    Yet, Zhu emphasized other aspects of education, which will  consolidate anti-illiteracy achievements, such as professional  education, adult education and higher learning.    A new mechanism will be gradually introduced on college  campuses, which requires more students to pay for tuition and  choose jobs by themselves, he revealed.    And the Education Commission will draft more than 20 laws  and  regulations this year to provide more legal protection for the  sector, including the law of education and the regulation for  foreigners to run schools in China, the minister added.</p>

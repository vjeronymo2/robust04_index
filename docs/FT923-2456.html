			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: BDM beats flotation forecast BRITISH DATA Management, the London-based data storage and management specialist which was floated on the Stock Exchange just before the general election, yesterday reported full-year results ahead of its flotation forecasts. Pre-tax profits in the year to June 30 more than doubled to Pounds 2.5m, against Pounds 1.14m a year earlier, comfortably beating the forecast of Pounds 2.38m. Turnover increased to Pounds 13m (Pounds 12.7m), buoyed by strong demand from the offshore oil industry for data storage facilities. Operating profits at Pounds 3.59m (Pounds 2.31m) also exceeded the Pounds 3.5m forecast at the end of March. Helped by lower-than-expected tax charges and interest cost, earnings per share increased to 11.9p (7.8p) out of which the company will pay a maiden dividend of 1p, as expected. Britannia Data Management, BDM's main operating subsidiary and the UK's largest contract storer of oil exploration data for leading oil companies, delivered the strongest performance, recording a 90 per cent increase in operating profits. Britannia Storage Systems, the specialist racking systems company, also enjoyed 'spectacular growth' with sharply higher operating profits. However, Eurocrate, although remaining profitable, suffered from the 'severe impact of the recession on the domestic and commercial removals market.' Mr Stephen Crown, chairman, noted that during the year BDM set up additional data storage facilities in Aberdeen to service the buoyant market for off-site storage services required by the oil industry. He said demand since opening had been so strong that the group was now looking for a second Aberdeen property. Despite the recession, Mr Crown said the volume of data stored and handled in the south-east continued to grow steadily. Reflecting this, BDM acquired the London-based data storage business of the Exclusive Group for Pounds 1.45m last month. Since the end of the financial year BDM has won two new five-year contracts for library and data management services from British Petroleum, valued at more than Pounds 1.6m a year. In addition, the group recently formed an alliance with US-based Ovation Data Services, which will now carry out all computer tape copying at BDM's storage site at Coulsdon in London. Mr Crown said the main focus for the company in the next year will be to expand organically, 'using our strong financial position to expand our presence in our chosen markets, including upgrading our information technology-based systems for ourselves and our customers.'</p>

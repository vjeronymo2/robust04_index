			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Guatemala City Teleonce Television in  Spanish at 0350 GMT on 1 March during its "Telepress" newscast  broadcasts a 38-minute recorded news conference by President  Ramiro de Leon Carpio with foreign and domestic reporters. The  place and date of the news conference are not given.    De Leon begins by announcing that on 28 February he sent  three draft laws to Congress, one of which calls for reforms to  the Electoral and Political Parties Law that will reduce to 76  the number of deputies and for making possible the participation  of civic committees in the elections.    The president adds that another draft calls for reforms to  Article 201 of the Penal Code in order "to punish more severely  the individuals responsible for kidnapping, as this is one of  the crimes that harms society the most." De Leon explains that  "prison sentences for kidnappers will be increased to 25 and 30  years, instead of the 8 and 15 years currently in force," and  that capital punishment -- which is now being applied only if  the kidnaped person dies during the action -- will also be  applied "if the victims are defenseless, such as minors, persons  over 60 years old, and women, as well as if the victim suffers  severe injuries." The third draft is the president's veto of a  decree that made reforms to the Social Welfare Institute of  Journalists.    Answering a reporter's question on the issue of human rights  and capital punishment, de Leon answers that "there is a  convention that establishes diminishing and possibly eliminating  capital punishment," and "it is up to Congress to examine this  issue carefully." With regard to recent visitors, de Leon  answers another question by saying: "Today I had the honor of  receiving the French minister delegate of humanitarian action  and human rights and the German vice chancellor. The Guatemalan  Government and president were very pleased to receive from the  French minister not only a ratification of support for the  Government of Guatemala, but also to receive from the French  people and Government recognition of the efforts the people and  Government of Guatemala are making to preserve and strengthen  our democracy." On the same subject, the president adds that  the German vice chancellor "reiterated Germany's economic,  technical, and moral support for Guatemala."    The reporters then ask de Leon Carpio about the public  health  situation, to which he responds that he had an urgent meeting  today with the health and finance ministers to discuss the  purchase of medications and the payment of old debts so the  hospitals may receive urgently needed supplies, such as oxygen  tanks.</p>

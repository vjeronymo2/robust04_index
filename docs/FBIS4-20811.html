			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, March 18 (CTK) -- Former Czechoslovak  Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier said today he knew nothing  about dangerous strains of bacteria and viruses designated for  the production of biological weapons having been stored in the  Czech Republic.    Dienstbier, foreign minister from December 1989 until June  1992, told journalists that at the time when he was a  Czechoslovak cabinet member, the possibility of nuclear,  biological or chemical weapons being stored on Czechoslovak  territory was investigated. "The Army had revised these things  and.... as far as I know nothing was found," Dienstbier said.    Petr Pithart, Czech premier from February 1990 until June  1992, told CTK that "he had no idea" about biological weapons  being stored in the Czech Republic. He added, however, that the  army was not within the jurisdiction of the Czech government.  He said it could have happened that "something was forgotten  somewhere" but the question could not be linked to political  motives.    Some Czech papers reported on Thursday [17 March] and today  that Czechoslovakia was charged with developing bacteriological  weapons in the framework of the former Warsaw Pact. A secret  branch of the Military Research Institute located in the  vicinity of the village of Techonin in the Orlicke Mountains,  east Bohemia, allegedly served this goal. The cultures of  bacteria and viruses developed there were allegedly hidden at  different place in the Czech Republic.    According to press reports, this would mean not only  violation of the Czech Republic's international commitments  since it is a signatory of the Geneva Convention whose members  had pledged not to develop, use or store biological weapons  without international consent, but also crime threatening the  public.    Chairman of the Czech Parliament's Defense and Security  Committee Vladimir Suman has asked Defense Minister Antonin  Baudys on Thursday to inform the committee about the alleged  storage of bacteriological and virological weapons in the Czech  Republic on April 7. Suman told journalists this today at a  press conference of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) of which he  is a member.</p>

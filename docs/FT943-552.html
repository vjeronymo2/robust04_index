			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Debt plan set for controversy Commonwealth finance ministers are likely to welcome the UK's initiative on debt relief when they issue a communique at the end of their meeting in Malta today. Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, has proposed that the debt burden of poor countries be relieved by extending the Trinidad terms, which cover bilateral debt, to debt owed to supra-national financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund. The debt relief programme would be financed by sales of up to 10 per cent of the IMF's Dollars 40bn of gold reserves. The proceeds would be reinvested in income-producing assets, and only the revenue earned from those assets used to finance the scheme. The overall value of the IMF's reserves would not be altered. While the support of the Commonwealth countries will be welcomed by the British government, it is likely to face serious opposition from countries represented at the IMF meeting in Madrid next week. Some nations will be cautious about the gold sales, since this will be perceived as weakening the creditworthiness of the IMF. Mr Chris Liebenberg, finance minister of South Africa, which is an important gold producer, said yesterday that a gold sale might also have inflationary consequences. However, Mr Liebenberg said he was in principle not against the proposal which needed more investigation. In his speech to the Malta meeting, Mr Clarke said: 'For some of the poorest countries even full Trinidad terms tomorrow would not allow them to escape from an unsustainable debt burden.' 'The IMF has played a key role in helping developing countries in both its lending and policy advice. But it must be on terms which countries can afford.' Mr Clarke's proposals would concentrate on poor, heavily indebted countries 'which have displayed a credible and durable commitment to economic reform,' the chancellor added. Mr Clarke proposes that the IMF's enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF) should be extended and lending made on easier terms, by lengthening the period over which the debt has to be repaid.</p>

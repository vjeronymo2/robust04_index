			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today, U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry  arrived in Minsk on a one-day official visit. The businesslike  relations of military partnership between the Republic of  Belarus and the United States began to take shape in 1992. The  first steps on this path were taken during the visit to the  United States by Alyaksandr Tushynski, first deputy defense  minister of the Republic of Belarus. By then, an agreement on  dealing with the aftermath of an emergency situation and the  nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction was signed  between our two countries. Belarusian and U.S. military  specialists are discussing the relative directions of military  cooperation, including such issues as conversion, control over  the export of radioactive materials, the training of servicemen,  and the creation of working groups to coordinate military  cooperation.    William Perry was received today by Belarusian Defense  Minister Pavel Kozlovskiy and Belarusian Prime Minister  Vyacheslav Kebich. Later in the day, the U.S. secretary of  defense will visit the Belarusian Supreme Soviet.    It is planned that the visit will result in the signing of a  joint agreement on the principles of a Belarusian-U.S. committee  for conversion.</p>

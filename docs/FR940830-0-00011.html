			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act increased the acreage for exempt producers from ``less than 5 acres'' to ``less than 10 acres'' of watermelons and changed the eligibility for producers to serve on the Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides that a producer is eligible to serve on the Board as a representative of handlers (1) if a producer purchases watermelons from other producers in a combined total volume that is equal to 25 percent or more of the producer's own production or (2) if the combined total volume of watermelons handled by the producer from the producer's own production and purchases from other producer's production is more than 50 percent of the producer's own production. This provision clarifies the eligibility of producers and handlers to serve on the Board as representatives of their specific group and also applies to voter eligibility. In addition, the increase in the exemption level from ``less than 5 acres'' to ``less than 10 acres'' will determine producer's eligibility to vote because only producers of 10 acres or more will be eligible to vote in the referendum. Therefore, this rule will amend &sect;&sect;1210.201 and 1210.202.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act also increases applicability of the law from the 48 contiguous States to the 50 States and the District of Columbia. Therefore, since they will be covered by the Plan, voters in Alaska, Hawaii, and the District of Columbia are entitled to vote in the referendum. This rule will amend &sect;1210.201 accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act also provides that all future promulgation and amendment referenda do not have to be conducted at Extension Service county offices. This procedure proved to be expensive and difficult to administer. The Act will now allow referenda to be conducted by mail ballot which will reduce the costs involved in conducting referenda and facilitate a more timely tabulation of the results. In order to make this change, this rule will amend &sect;&sect;1210.203 and 1210.204.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Minor changes are made in this final rule for the purpose of clarity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, conforming changes will be made to &sect;1210.201.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of all relevant material presented with regard to the procedures to conduct a referendum, it is found that they effectuate the declared policy of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the provisions in 5 U.S.C. 553, it is found and determined that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  because:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A proposed rule with request for comments was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and comments were received and they are addressed in this rule; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) It is necessary to have these procedures in place in order to conduct the referendum in November 1994; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) No useful purpose will be served by a delay of the effective date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1210  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Agricultural promotion, Agricultural research, Market development, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Watermelons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, Part 1210, Chapter XI of Title 7 is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 1210_WATERMELON RESEARCH AND PROMOTION  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

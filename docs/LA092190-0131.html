			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> COUNCIL APPROVES NEW TREE ORDINANCE  </P> <P> After years of discussion and debate, City Council members approved a new tree  ordinance this week, setting up procedures for trimming and removing trees on  city streets.  </P> <P> The new ordinance, which takes effect in 30 days, holds the city responsible  for trimming trees located on city-owned parkways and gives the city control  over removing trees and planting replacements. That replaces the old system,  which allowed residents to do those tasks, if they first received city  permission.  </P> <P> The council passed the plan on a 3-1 vote, with Councilwoman Miriam Kaywood  absent.  </P> <P> Councilman Tom Daly, who voted for the ordinance, lauded the parks department  for updating its existing tree program.  </P> <P> "Some street trees don't look very good. We need to fix that," Daly said. "And  I think this is a good first step."  </P> <P> Councilman William D. Ehrle cast the only vote against the plan. "I think it's  not enforceable and really a contradiction," Ehrle said.  </P> <P> Some of the residents who met with parks department officials drafting the  ordinance expressed their own displeasure with the final product, which they  said concentrates too much authority over trees in the city's hands.  </P> <P> "It doesn't answer any questions, and it doesn't please anyone who went to  those meetings," said Joe White, who lives on Broadway, where about three dozen  70-year-old oak and ash trees were razed earlier this year. "There's a need to  change the ordinance; however, I don't think this ordinance is the one."  </P> <P> White was one of a few residents who spoke against the ordinance at the City  Council meeting this week. Those opposed were primarily concerned that the city  did not create a special board to handle appeals of city staff decisions  regarding trees.  </P> <P> The residents had instead lobbied for a group of citizens and city officials to  have the last word in cases where residents disagreed with the staff about its  plans for certain trees.

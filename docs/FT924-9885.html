			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / World Commodities Prices: Tea There were 19,612 packages for the day, reports the Tea Brokers' Association. There was again a good general demand. Landed Assams sold readily with better liquoring sorts fully firm to dearer, but plainer mediums tending easier. East African teas met strong competition and Pekoe Dusts often gained several pence. Price levels were fully maintained except towards the close. Offshore: fair demand at firm rates. The highest price realised this week was 196p for an Assam pf. Quotations: quality 180p, good medium 150p, medium 132p, low medium 88p.</p>

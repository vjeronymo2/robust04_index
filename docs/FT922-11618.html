			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Taiwan aims to streamline pig sector - An industry dogged by environmental protests TAIWAN'S PIG industry, dogged by environmental protests and low pork prices, is likely to face a downturn in the coming months, as the government implements policies to upgrade and streamline the industry. The island's pig population recently topped 10m, which is one pig for every two people. As well as satisfying domestic demand, pork is also the island's largest agricultural export. Last year it exported Dollars 700m worth of chilled and frozen pork, 90 per cent of which went to the Japanese market. Taiwan's proximity to Japan and its lower labour costs has given it distinct advantages over its major competitors there, namely Denmark, the Netherlands and the US. The Taiwanese market, however, is still closed to European meat, ostensibly for veterinary reasons. Pork prices have been about TDollars 4,000 (USDollars 160) per 100 kg for the past year now, which pork producers say barely covers their costs. Last year saw a drop in the number of smallholdings with 200 pigs or less, while farms with 200 to 1,000 and 1,000-5,000 pigs increased by about 30 per cent and 40 per cent respectively. The environmental price, however, has been high. With one pig producing 3.5 kg of manure and urine per day, 35,000 tonnes daily have been pouring into Taiwan's lakes and rivers, turning them black and devoid of oxygen. The government's strategy has been to encourage farmers to install waste treatment technology, promising TDollars 300 per pig to this end for farmers in water conservation areas, and double that for those who are forced to give up farming pigs altogether. Provincial government officials claim that 65 per cent of farms inspected so far have come up to regulation standards. Pig associations say that this will do little to help farms with less than 200 pigs, who will be hardest hit by the policy. With the worst environmental record and little spare cash, very few such farmers are likely to come up to new standards to be set towards the end of the year. In some areas telephone hotlines have been set up, and the public encouraged to lodge complaints against casual pig farms that pollute their neighbourhood. Such complaints can lead to fines of TDollars 60,000, an amount likely to bankrupt smallholders. Other analysts say that a strong farming lobby and the availability of low interest loans from the government and farmers' unions, mean that the smaller pig farms are unlikely to be sacrificed entirely. One of the larger players, too, has been exploring other options. TaiSugar will not be investing any new funds in its pig farming operations in Taiwan, saying that the future looks uncertain. The state-owned enterprise has been exploring possible sitings for new pig farms as far afield as Canada and Australia. On the other hand, Chia Hsin Livestock, with 35,000 pigs and diverse agricultural interests, says it is confident it can ride out the slump in pork prices. An official of the cabinet-controlled Council of Agriculture said that the government hoped to reduce the pig population by as much as 20 per cent, scaling down the industry to subsistence level, while at the same time making it more high-tech and efficient. A contraction of this nature would in turn affect the demand for feed grain and soyabeans. Taiwan is heavily dependent on imports of these items, mainly from the US, importing more than Dollars 1bn of maize and soyabeans last year.</p>

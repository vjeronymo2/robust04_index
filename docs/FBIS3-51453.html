"Our meetings are characterized by their substantial  agendas;  there is no time for such unimportant issues," Robaina said in  the second part of an interview published today by EL SOL DE  MEXICO. "Thoughts about multipartyism are not among our  country's many priorities at this time," Robaina added.    Asked if there has been any reaction within the government  to  exiled Cubans' statements supporting multipartyism, the Cuban  foreign minister responded: "From the time I began participating  in the meetings, an issue of such little importance has never  been on the agenda. The historical reasons that joined us into a  single party are stronger today than ever."    Robaina asserted, "There used to be multipartyism in Cuba  and  all those parties did very little to resolve the considerable  problems our society had experienced for over half a century."</p>

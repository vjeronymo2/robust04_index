			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Two-tier local authority structure more likely to offer coherence Sir, In response to your editorial, 'Local difficulties' (December 22), and Peter Mandelson's letter (December 30), I think evidence suggests a two-tier system can work best of all. The 39 English shire counties, along with their eight Welsh counterparts, provide the strategic dimension that is surely needed in local government. They can promote whole areas as a coherent economic entity, and work in partnership to attract inward investment with other agencies plus training and enterprise councils. Mr Mandelson makes the point with regard to service provision that it must be close to the people. But it must be remembered that the personal services the shire counties provide (social services, education) are expensive, and need large populations to gain economies of scale. This is why the single-tier county borough system was replaced in 1974. The current debate constantly refers to the argument that districts should adopt county services and that the county should be abolished. But if this were to happen, especially in the absence of a regional tier of government, the strategic dimension would be lost. Much better to publicise the services that each tier provides in simple fashion. The current debate also has apparently assumed that while counties try to protect their interests, districts would do no such thing. The self-interest/preservation question is a double-edged sword; it should not be employed against the counties in isolation. Finally, Mr Mandelson uses Cleveland as an example of a county that is unpopular. In the interests of balance, I feel compelled to point out that Cleveland is a rare example of a county with thin popular identity, in that it is an artificial construction, like Avon or Humberside. Others like Lancashire or Cheshire have no such problem. A G Strickland, 139 Childwall Road, Wavertree, Liverpool LI5 6US</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Airline launches season ticket BRITISH MIDLAND Airways, the UK independent airline, is to launch a season ticket fare which it claims will save between 37 per cent and 65 per cent for business travellers on busy European routes, Paul Betts writes. The scheme, Diamond EuroPass, will entitle business travellers to five fully flexible return business-class journeys to be made on any of its direct international routes within three months of purchase. The pass will be priced in two bands: Pounds 799 covering travel between London Heathrow and Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris and Dublin; and Pounds 999 for travel on any route on the airline's international network. It will be available from September 13 in the UK and the end of the month overseas.</p>

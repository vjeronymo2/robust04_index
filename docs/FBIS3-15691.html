The representatives of GAZPROM arrived Friday in Riga to  sign  a new contract with Latvia for year 1994.    Latvia considers the price for gas should be smaller because  Russia uses Incukalns underground gas repository.    In return Russia demands that Latvia did payments for gas  beforehand.    BNS already reported that GAZPROM breached February 11, 1993  a contract on gas supply with the three Baltic states and  GAZPROM branch company LENTRANSGAZ.    During the meeting the representatives of GAZPROM named  Latvia's 23 million U.S. dollars debt to the organization and  necessity to centralize all payments to be the main reasons for  the breaching of contract.    Birkavs informed that Latvian Government has given  permission  to use Japanese export-import bank's loan (which is part of G-24  credit given to Latvia) for paying back the debt.    Lithuanian state enterprise LIETUVAS GAZE signed Thursday  agreement on cooperation with GAZPROM. According to the  agreement, Lithuania will receive 2.7 billion cubic meters of  natural gas paying 75 U.S. dollars for one thousand cubic meters  of gas.</p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (8): The pursuits of non-stop brokers - SBJ Regis Low Brokers have traditionally generated much of their business in the US and have traditionally been enthusiastic and successful exporters. But with insurance rates depressed and the dollar weak, profitability has been eroded of late. Success increasingly depends on the aggressive pursuit of business. And that, in a nutshell, appears to be the key to the recent profitability of SBJ Regis Low, a Lloyd's insurance broking subsidiary of Steel Burrill Jones, today awarded the Queen's Award for Export Achievement. Regis Low's founders - Mr David Low, Mr Hugh Armytage and Mr Keith Grant-Dalton, brokers - left Seascope, another London market broker in 1982, to start up their new energy insurance broking venture from scratch. The company's focused initially on oil rigs and other offshore installations, later diversifying into hull and cargo risks, political risks and construction insurance. Its share of these specialised markets has grown rapidly, earning fee and commission income of Pounds 11.7m in 1991. Three-quarters of revenues are from business generated in the US, Scandinavia, Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States and south-east Asia. Overseas earnings have doubled in the past three years. Regis Low specialises in so-called 'wholesale' insurance broking, placing insurance programmes on behalf of retail brokers who deal directly with clients such as oil rig operators and shipping lines. Margins are high. Some of Regis Low's competitors in the field such as Lloyd Thompson - which has had a stock market listing since 1987 and Jenner Fenton Slade - have achieved handsome rates of return. Regis Low's profitability has been so impressive - the group earned over Pounds 4.6m in 1991 - that Steel Burrill Jones, a listed medium-sized broker, was persuaded to spend over Pounds 30m to acquire Regis last December. The price was viewed as excessive in some quarters but SBJ, which grew at rapid pace in the 1980s, was anxious to diversify from its original specialisation in marine reinsurance - an even more volatile and high risk sector than energy insurance - and has made other acquisitions to reduce that dependence. In addition, Regis Low's business knitted in well with SBJ's reinsurance interests: the broker can now more adequately provide insurers with a flow of business and look after its reinsurance needs. Moreover, Mr George Boden, managing director, says he was also impressed by the high energy style of Regis Low's broking teams. 'They work from the early part of the day until late at night - hardly a day goes by when they're not out with clients from North America in the evening. It's just non-stop.' Mr Boden adds that Regis Low's 130 staff 'love winning and hate losing.' The company's brokers have a detailed knowledge of the London insurance market - made up by the 280 syndicates at Lloyd's of London and international companies - and place highly complex insurance programmes with a number of syndicates and insurers. 'The broker has to understand the risk, describe it, find underwriters to back it and then negotiate rates.' With Lloyd's underwriters in particular wary about the risks they write after suffering heavy losses in recent years, 'that can can be a sweaty business,' says Mr Boden.</p>

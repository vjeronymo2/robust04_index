			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech (Analysis): More measured approach - Political asylum THE POLITICAL momentum behind the Asylum Bill has fallen since it was first published last November. And while the government still regards the task of controlling flows of refugees into Britain as a serious problem it gave the bill little more than a passing reference in yesterday's legislative agenda. With the election out of the way, and with the first three months of the year showing a sharp fall in asylum requests, the government can adopt a more measured approach. The Bill was postponed by being withdrawn from the committee stage in the House of Lords in February. This followed fierce criticism from lawyers, church leaders and refugee organisations. Opponents claimed that plans for a highly restricted appeals procedure for applicants refused asylum could lead to refugees being unjustly returned to face persecution in their home countries. Government officials said yesterday that it was not clear when the bill would be resubmitted. If it were delayed until the autumn, the bill would not become law until next summer. The government has made clear that the Bill will be reintroduced with the amendments already made during its passage through the Commons earlier this year. The bill as originally tabled gave asylum-seekers only 48 hours to request leave to appeal against their applications being turned down. The government has since increased this to 10 days, a period which Amnesty says still does not give applicants sufficient time to prepare their cases. According to government figures, there were 44,700 applications for asylum in the UK last year, a 10-fold increase compared with 1988. Officials however recognise that a large proportion reflected requests by people placing more than one application in order to defraud the social security authorities. Applications in the first three months this year fell to only 1,730 a month against an average of 3,730 last year.</p>

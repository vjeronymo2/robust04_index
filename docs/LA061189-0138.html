			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUMMER JOBS FOR YOUTH AT DISNEYLAND  </P> <P> With reference to your essay (June 4) on summer work at Disneyland, Bob Secter  enumerates the dress code and other regulations given by Disneyland to its  prospective employees. He sarcastically and judgmentally denigrates youths of  today as if young men with earrings are the norm.  </P> <P> What he fails to discuss is the scholar-athletes and student leaders that are  more the norm of today's youth. They are even recognized in the same newspaper  as his article (see Sports and the outstanding student citizen section).  </P> <P> He also fails to mention that the general admission price of entrance to this  park is $23.50. Anyone who is paid as little as $4.75 to $5 an hour couldn't  even afford to get in.  </P> <P> RAY BROWN  </P> <P> PEG BROWN  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

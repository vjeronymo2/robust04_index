The Eagle Space Airport along with TASCO's two  other projects-- the Thai Aircraft Maintenance Co Ltd (TAMCO)  and The Eagle Flying Club -- will be located on 1,400 rai in  Ratchaburi province, 20 minutes' flying time from Bangkok.    Financial backing for the project has come from Nava Finance  and Securities, Krung Thai Bank and a number of other financial  institutions.    The airport will be the first general aviation airport and  together the three projects will provide "integrated aviation-  related services", according to TASCO managing director Prarom  Mokawet. "There are some private airports in Thailand but they  do not accommodate public planes. This airport will be the  first one in the country to be registered with the civil  aviation board for public use," said Mr Prarom. "We will be able  to accommodate and maintain all `light' aircraft smaller than a  Boeing 737," he said.    The initial runway will be 1.4 kilometres in length with two  taxi ways, and facilities at the airport will be able to handle  up to 400 planes.    A 155-room hotel and resort complex to be managed by the  Radisson group will also be part of the Eagle Space Project.    At first the firm will concentrate purely on smaller private  aircraft but if the project is successful it will consider  enlarging facilities to accommodate large commercial aircraft as  well.    At present maintenance of aircraft in the country can only  be  carried out by Thai Airways International, so many private  aircraft are sent to Singapore for servicing, resulting in a  loss of considerable revenue to Thailand. But, Mr Prarom pointed  out, "the private sector in Thailand has never really ventured  into any large-scale aviation ventures and since we are subject  to Civil Aviation regulations we do not want to launch into a  large-scale commercial airport that would be in competition with  existing government ones. The aim is to support government  aviation," he said.    As yet TASCO has no competitors but Mr Prarom believes that  other groups will soon become very interested in establishing  more private airports.    The second project, TAMCO, is an aircraft maintenance  operation that will be a joint venture between TASCO and THAI.    "At present we are making a feasibility study in conjunction  with THAI, who subject to agreement will be our partner in  TAMCO," he said. Both partners would provide equipment, but THAI  would provide personnel alone as it was very difficult to find  highly-trained staff in the private sector, Mr Prarom said  Maintenance will be available for all private aircraft as well  as THAI and Bangkok Airways planes. The Eagle Flying Club for  both local and foreign flying enthusiasts will provide equipment  for pilots and flying lessons.    The completion date for the entire project has been set for  late 1996 or 1997.    TASCO has future plans to establish helicopter ambulance  services and to work in conjunction with both the police and  traffic monitoring services.</p>

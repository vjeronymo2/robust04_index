			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Credit insurance protest in Canada A GOVERNMENT proposal to allow Canada's Export Development Corporation to enter the domestic credit insurance business has drawn strong protests from British and US-owned insurance companies in Canada. It is the most contentious part of a draft bill, expected to be introduced in parliament this week. The EDC, Canada's export finance and credit insurance agency, wants to expand into underwriting domestic credit risks to help it win back export business which it has lost in recent years to private-sector insurers offering both domestic and export coverage. The corporation has seen some of its biggest export accounts move to foreign-owned underwriters, notably subsidiaries of Trade Indemnity of the UK, and American International Companies and Continental Insurance of the US. These companies have expanded aggressively in Canada over the past few years. Trade Indemnity, which set up in Ottawa in 1989, already underwrites about CDollars 4bn in sales, split roughly equally between domestic and export business. Mr Rick Doyle, its president, says: 'If big exporters have found better service and one-stop shopping in the private sector, why should the government come in?' The private insurers complain that the EDC's status as a government agency gives it many advantages, including tax-free status and the absence of requirements to set up reserves against liabilities. 'It would be difficult for us to compete against a company that could basically buy the market,' Mr Doyle says. The EDC declined to comment on the legislation until it is presented. However, it is said to be concerned that the private insurers are 'cherry-picking', in other words, taking its biggest and best export insurance customers, and leaving it with the more risky business from mid-sized and small companies. The new legislation will also expand the EDC's export-finance mandate, with a view to making it more competitive with European and Japanese export-finance agencies. The Corporation is expected to become more active in pre-export financing, including the ability to make direct loans against inventory and working capital assets. The EDC will also be empowered to enhance a financing proposal by taking an equity stake in a company or a project, and will be given greater leeway to provide support for leasing machinery and equipment. Canadian exporters have complained that the EDC's services are increasingly falling behind those offered by other countries' export finance and credit insurance agencies.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (5): Job cuts could trigger social unrest - Steel industry THE next three months could be decisive for Ilva, Italy's state-owned steel group, and for thousands of jobs in the south where most steel is made. The prognosis is for a bleak Christmas at Taranto, the country's biggest integrated steelworks, and at most of the other facilities where Ilva is based. With chronic losses, over-capacity and a running row with the European Commission in Brussels, tough measures in the form of job cuts and plant closures looks inevitable. That could trigger a new round of social unrest in an already volatile environment. Workers at Taranto blockaded crucial parts of the vast plant last month in a foretaste of what might take place if rationalisation has to be pushed through in earnest in an area of already very high unemployment. Everything will hinge on the outcome of talks between the Italians, represented by Ilva, the IRI state holding company which owns it, and the Rome government, and the Commission. After several exchanges of fire earlier this year, the final reckoning looks set to be dramatic. At stake is the credibility of the Commission's programme to reduce steelmaking in the Community on one hand and the risk of thousands of redundancies in southern Italy on the other. With the Italian economy in recession, the contents and presentation of the plan could also be the touch paper which could ignite a series of other, potentially explosive, labour disputes simmering at loss-making state enterprises. The latest Ilva restructuring plan will be the third in 1993. Each has represented a significant watering down of its predecessor, although none have so far met with the Commission's approval. The row began earlier this year when Mr Hayao Nakamura, Ilva's managing director, hired from Nippon Steel, proclaimed that the company set little store by the Commission's call for capacity cuts and an end to state subsidies. Insisting that Ilva was independent of the state - its parent, IRI, was turned into a joint stock company last year - Mr Nakamura argued that Europe's steel crisis would best be solved by a 'gentleman's agreement' between leading producers. Events overtook him with the arrival of Mr Romano Prodi as IRI's new chairman. The earlier plan had to be rewritten and a new stress was placed on privatisation to reduce Ilva's burden on its parent company. Subsequent amendments resulted in the most recent proposal. This involves splitting Ilva into two separate companies. One would specialise in flat laminates - based on the big Taranto and Novi Ligure works - while the second would concentrate on stainless steels, produced at the group's plant at Terni in Umbia. IRI has even given mandates to two merchant banks, Italy's IMI group and Barclays of the UK, to put forward privatisation plans for the two operations. Separately, Dalmine, the big seamless tubes group in which Ilva is the biggest shareholder, seems destined for privatisation via either a share flotation or the sale of Ilva's majority stake to a leading European steelmaker. The new plan also backtracked notably on the issue of how to deal with Ilva's huge debts, which amounted to L7,583bn at the end of last year. While the original proposal implied the bulk of the debt would be assumed by IRI, along with any surplus plant that could not sold, the new proposal mollified Commission objections by including an appreciably lower debt transfer to the parent company. The revision was partly dictated by IRI's new management which, facing about L73,000bn in group debts, is determined to reduce borrowings. The dispute with the Commission has only exacerbated an already very difficult situation for the Rome government. Ilva's losses, which amounted to L2,309bn last year, will remain extremely high this year because of the recession and continuing weakness in the prices of many products. Earlier this year, Mr Nakamura said he hoped the company would contain its 1993 loss to L1,500bn. In August, however, Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, said losses would be about L2,000bn. He added that Ilva's consolidated debts had fallen only marginally in the first six months of this year, to stand at about L7,500bn by the end of June. Since then has come the protest at Taranto which, although resolved relatively quickly, cost the group billions of lire in lost production. Negotiations are believed to be under way for the disposal of several Ilva assets. The two merchant banks given the privatisation mandates are studying a range of options. These include a full or partial sale to some leading private-sector Italian steelmakers who have at various times expressed an interest in taking a stake in specific plant. Most recently, attention has focused on selling Ilva's shipping operation. Yet all the options face drawbacks. The problem is that even Italy's once ebullient private steel groups are facing hard times. Cremona-based Arvedi group is in negotiations with its bankers on restructuring its debts, believed to be well over L1,000bn. Falck, the Milan-based company, is in loss and recently faced the additional burden of seeing some of its management put under investigation over alleged political corruption. Meanwhile both Luigi Lucchini and Steno Marcegaglia, two of Italy's best known private steel producers, who have expressed interest in both the Taranto and Terni works, are proceeding with extreme caution given the economic climate. The Commission is also under considerable pressure, notably from British Steel in the UK and the leading German steel groups, to be uncompromising with Ilva. The issue of Italian state aid - not just to steel, but also to other IRI subsidiaries - is highly contentious. However, Commission officials may prefer to negotiate a workable compromise they believe will be observed and can stick, rather than hold out for a harsher agreement which might either run the risk of not being respected fully or provoke such civil strife in Italy as to become a political non-starter.</p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Japanese companies buy more machinery Japanese companies bought more machinery in August for the third month running, the latest evidence that the decline in capital spending has bottomed out. A 7.1 per cent rise in machinery orders from the same month last year shows machinery purchases could grow 4.7 per cent from the second to the and third quarter of this year, the government's Economic Planning Agency said. But Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, international trade and industry minister, cautioned yesterday on the strength of capital investment recovery. A slow pick-up in capital investment, especially for small and medium businesses, figured among several worries over the slowness of Japan's economic recovery, he said. He feared small business output would revive more slowly than in previous recoveries, and reductions in unsold stocks and materials were 'stumbling'. The yen's continuing strength was a worry for small businesses, Mr Hashimoto told the parliament's budget committee. The recent growth in machinery orders, a leading indicator for overall capital investment, has been driven mainly by exports and the public sector, according to James Capel Pacific. The figures exclude shipbuilding and electric power utilities.</p>

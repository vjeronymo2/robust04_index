			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / UK shares close at new high THE FT-SE 100 finished yesterday at a record close, completing a week in which mounting expectations of a UK interest rate cut pushed the share index through 3,000 for the first time, writes Emma Tucker. The index closed up 40.3 on the week at 3,010.1, with Thursday's poor economic news, including a sharp fall in UK manufacturing output and a small rise in unemployment, encouraging hopes for an early loosening of monetary policy. This sentiment, together with a strong D-Mark, pushed the pound lower on the foreign exchanges. Sterling ended the day down two pfennigs at DM2.4975. There was good news for the government in the latest unit wage and productivity figures published yesterday which showed that industry's competitiveness continues to improve. Wages and salaries per unit of manufacturing output fell by 3 per cent in the three months to the end of June, compared with the same quarter a year ago, while productivity rose by 8.2 per cent.

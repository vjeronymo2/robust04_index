			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Defense Minister General Rafael Angel Montero  Revette has said certain officers involved in the 1992 coup  attempts will be promoted to the next rank on 5 July after the  head of state approved the list proposed by the qualifying board  and the four branches of the military institution.    [Reporter Vicente Briceno] Gen. Montero Revette has made the  announcement from Miraflores Palace, disclosing the decision by  the president with whom he met for approximately three hours to  review the military promotions that will be submitted to  Congress in the coming days.    Through the Senate's Committee of Defense, Congress will  study the appropriate files. Montero has reported the approval  of the following promotions: 30 brigade generals, 10 of which  are in the Army, six in the Air Force, eight in the National  Guard, and six Navy rear admirals.    Also up for promotion are 120 colonels, broken down as  follows: 40 in the Army, 25 in the aviation division, 35 in the  National Guard, and 20 ship of the line captains in the Navy.    As the minister explained, the promotions to the ranks of  vice admirals and division general were left pending for next  week because President Rafael Caldera was unable to review them.  Montero has said that based on a decision by the president, a  group of officers from the four branches who participated in the  1992 coup attempts will also be promoted on that same date.    [Begin Montero recording] These officers, primarily from the  Army, rejoined the force more than two years ago and are working  in troop commands in different posts of the organization. They  have the same rights and duties of other officers. For that  reason, those entitled to a promotion are evaluated. He may or  may not be promoted, but not due to the coup attempts, because  that is over for us. [end recording]    [Briceno] The defense minister has added that, like the  officers who participated in the 1992 coup attempts, the  enlistees who joined them in these actions will also be  promoted. President Caldera has dropped the charges against  these soldiers.    Commenting on the return to the country of General Francisco  Viconti, Montero has said President Caldera, as Armed Forces  commander in chief, and the Defense Ministry have felt his  return to military active duty is impossible; for that reason,  he will be discharged.</p>

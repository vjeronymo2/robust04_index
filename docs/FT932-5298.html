			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Letter: Lessons in competition law can be painful Sir, As a competition lawyer one becomes used to ignorance and disregard among some sectors of the business community of laws regulating anti-competitive agreements. 'Minding Your Own Business' (May 22/23) profiled an individual selling up-market clothes. Maintaining that he 'sticks rigidly to recommended retail prices' the proprietor went on to state that he complains to suppliers when he discovers any shop selling below RRP. Furthermore, we were informed, 'one top label' (which remains nameless) 'stipulates that retailers must sell at a mark-up of 300 per cent - to protect sales at its own shops'. Not only could such an arrangement contravene the Resale Prices Act 1976 and require prior registration with the Office of Fair Trading under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976, but it is likely also to infringe Article 85(1) of the Rome treaty. Whether the parties know or care, they should at least be warned of the European Commission's powers to fine them up to 10 per cent of annual, worldwide turnover, of the unenforceability of the resale price restrictions and of the rights of third parties to bring actions for damages for loss suffered through the operation of such arrangements. In the face of such penalties, the bliss of ignorance - be it feigned or otherwise - is quickly replaced through an expensive initiation into the detail of competition law enforcement and penalties.

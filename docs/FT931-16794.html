			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Labour attacked on Clinton focus LABOUR's leadership receives a fresh challenge today when Mr John Prescott renews his criticism of its fascination with US president-elect Bill Clinton's victory. As the leading shadow cabinet sceptic, Mr Prescott will use an appearance on the BBC's Kilroy programme to warn against politicians' decisions being driven by public opinion, the views of image makers or the findings of polls. Meanwhile, advocates of a fundamental change of identity for Labour are preparing to press their case with the publication of an article, entitled Lessons from America, drawing strongly on the Clinton campaign's achievements. The paper, by Mr Philip Gould and Ms Patricia Hewitt - close aides to Mr Neil Kinnock in Labour's 1992 election team - is published in the first edition of Renewal, a new constituency activists' magazine from the Labour Co-ordinating Committee. It argues that the party must refocus its appeal by creating new populist politics, aimed at the majority, not minorities, and one that abandons 'stereotyped political language.' Last night, Mr Prescott reiterated his claim that the so-called 'Clintonisation' of Labour is becoming a crucial struggle for the future of the party. In a foretaste of his broadcast, Labour's transport spokesman said the growing debate over how much should be learnt from the US election vindicated his decision last month to counsel the party publicly against modelling itself on the new Democrats. 'What people saw as a bit of sour grapes from me is clearly more substantial than that,' he said. 'It is a matter of the heart and soul of the Labour party.' Mr Prescott used his campaign last summer for the deputy leadership to champion Labour's traditional working-class values. He attacked what he saw as an election strategy driven more by glitter and show business techniques than policy in speeches clearly aimed at the metropolitan middle class, personified by Mr Gould and Ms Hewitt. He also vigorously defended Labour's trade union links, winning widespread popularity in the party's blue-collar grass roots, becoming for many the de facto leader of those who resisted the root-and-branch changes demanded by so-called modernisers. Mr Prescott insisted last night that he was ready to hear the conclusions members of the Clinton team had drawn from their victory. He went on, though, to counsel against allowing pollsters to act as the new 'high priests' of politics, saying such a development would consign the politicians themselves to becoming mere actors. Evidence of the growing intensity of Labour's debate over Mr Clinton's election campaign is abundant this week. After a visit of Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, before Christmas, Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary, and Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, are both in Washington this week, making contact with the incoming US administration. On Friday, two leading Clinton campaign strategists - Mr Stan Greenberg, a policy director, and Mr Bob Boorstein, deputy communications director - will address a private meeting of the leader's committee - Mr John Smith's top advisory group on party strategy. The two men are due at the weekend to discuss the president-elect's economic plans at a London conference sponsored by the Transport and General Workers' Union and expected to draw many senior Labour figures. The moderniser faction in the Labour leadership, widely considered a majority in the shadow cabinet, appear increasingly convinced that the party must draw strongly on the Democrats' experience in 1992. A senior official said last night that, while that need not influence policy, the Clinton victory carried important lessons about how to project a programme that will appeal to the widest possible constituency among electors.</p>

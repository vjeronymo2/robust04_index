			<p>SUMMARY                                  On 24 june both chambers of the Federal Assembly passed the 1994  budget, resisting furious Defense Ministry attempts to boost  defense allocations and approving a budget bill with few major  changes from the Government's proposals except for a significant  increase in agricultural spending skillfully wangled by the  agrarian lobby.  The State Duma concluded its revisions two weeks  earlier when it approved the bill by a one-vote margin in a vote  that revealed a surprising lineup of forces--support from the  Agrarians, Communists, and ultranationalist Liberal Democrats  despite the low defense budget, while reformers largely voted  against it or abstained.  The budget's relatively quick passage  through the legislature may not, however, be an accurate portent  for future budget processes, as the Duma already appears to be  preparing for a more lengthy and rigorous scrutiny of the 1995  budget.                             END SUMMARY      On 24 june the Duma voted 273 to 80 (with 8 abstentions) to pass  the 1994 budget (ITAR-TASS, 24 june), reversing its defeat two  days earlier, when the Duma failed to pass it on the third  reading--supposedly a mere formality (See Box 1)--and when the  Duma's usual high absenteeism and perhaps some last-minute doubts  on the part of deputies prevented it from mustering the required  majority.  Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin, evidently unwilling to let  the chamber defeat the budget and risk being branded as  ineffective, bent the rules of procedure in forcing repeat votes.  The Agrarian Faction, eager to pass the budget because of its  generous allocations to agriculture, aided Rybkin in this  endeavor, reportedly proposing that the Duma hold a repeat vote  on the 24th because 15 of its members were absent on 22 june  (Interfax, 22 june).  Rybkin, reportedly angry at the budget's  failure to pass (Segodnya, 23 june), canceled all scheduled  business trips by deputies and ordered them all to be present for  the "crucial" budget vote on Friday (Interfax, 22 june).  Earlier, Rybkin had predicted that the third and supposedly final  reading of the budget, scheduled for 22 june, would be a largely  pro forma review of the law's language (Interfax, 9 june), and  its defeat in three separate votes (See Note 1) evidently came as  a surprise.      (Note 1) On the first attempt, with 295 deputies (out of 450)  voting, it failed by a wide margin of 32 votes; the second vote,  with 299 deputies present, failed by only six votes; and the  third vote failed by a wider margin of 14 votes, despite the  presence of 315 deputies (ITAR-TASS, Interfax, 22 june).  According to Article 116 of the Duma's regulations, the Duma  needs a majority of the total number (obshcheye chislo) of the  chamber's deputies, defined in Article 86 as 450, to adopt laws  (Reglament Gosudarstvennoy Dumy Federalnogo Sobraniya--Parlamenta  Rossiyskoy Federatsii, dated 25 March and 25 April 1994).      Upper House's Surprise Support      Possibly indicating the upper house's sensitivity to pressure  exerted on it to pass the budget and not appear obstructionist,  the Federation Council also passed the budget the same day  despite having voiced objections to its low level of defense  spending (ITAR-TASS, 24 june).  In response to statements from  Federation Council leaders on the need to increase the defense  allocation (See Box 2), the Duma had signaled that it would not  back down on the budget, issuing a statement after it had  approved the budget's provisions on 8 june affirming its position  and portraying its vote as one of fiscal responsibility that  establishes "firm control" over "taxpayers' money" (Radio Rossii,  Interfax, 10 june).  The Duma's Rybkin lashed out at the upper  chamber's threat to reject the budget, warning that if it tried  to "destroy the budget," he would expose its opponents and "tell  the public who they used to be and why they have been undermining  the budget for four years" (Interfax, 8 june).  Moreover, the  Duma reportedly refused to hear a presentation by the Federation  Council's chairman of the Budget and Finance Committee, Nikolay  Gonchar, on the Federation Council's objections to the budget  (ITAR-TASS, 21 june).  President Boris Yeltsin may have pressured  Shumeyko to encourage the Federation Council to pass the budget  when the two met on 9 june, reportedly to discuss the  "effectiveness" of the upper chamber's work and presumably also  to discuss the budget passed the day before in the Duma (Moscow  NTV, ITAR-TASS, 9 june).      Budget's Main Provisions      The Duma had completed its revisions to the budget on 8 june with  few major changes to the government's figures, resisting severe  pressure from the Ministry of Defense and two of its own  committees for a huge boost in defense allocations, holding the  line on the deficit, but significantly increasing spending on  agriculture.  The budget calls for overall expenditures of 194.4  trillion rubles (R) and revenues of R124.4 trillion, leaving a  deficit amounting to 9.6 percent of GDP (Interfax, 8 june).  The  government's original figures had called for expenditures of  R183.1 trillion, revenues of R120.7 trillion, and a deficit  estimated at 8 to 9 percent of GDP (ITAR-TASS, 15 April).  Despite intensive lobbying by the military (see box 3), the  budget calls for only R40.6 trillion in defense spending, far  below the R55 trillion supported by the Duma's Defense and  Economic Policy committees and only a modest increase from the  R37.1 trillion figure approved on 11 May in the first reading.  In contrast to the military's setback, agriculture fared well,  receiving R15.3 trillion, up from R11.9 trillion in the  government's draft (ITAR-TASS, 27 May; Kommersant-Daily, 28 May).  Deputy Premier and Agrarian Party member Aleksandr Zaveryukha  credited the increase to "tough work" conducted by the Ministry  of Agriculture in the government and the Duma (Rossiyskaya  Gazeta, 26 May).      Committees Vie for Influence      The budget's relatively quick progress in the Duma marks a  victory for Mikhail Zadornov (Yabloko bloc), the moderate  reformist chairman of the Duma's Budget, Taxation, Banking, and  Finance Committee, who apparently concluded that the Duma should  postpone any effort to make major revisions in the budget until  it begins consideration of the 1995 budget.  In an interview to  the mass circulation newspaper Trud (23 March), Zadornov stated,  "In the current year, unfortunately, there is little that can be  changed [in the budget]."  Instead, he appears eager to get a  start on the 1995 budget, which he has asked the government to  submit in September (Segodnya, 16 April) in the expectation that,  working with a less pressing deadline, the Duma will exert  greater influence on economic policy in 1995.      By contrast, Economic Policy Committee Chairman Sergey Glazyev  (Democratic Party of Russia) wanted to delay passage of the 1994  budget and attempt more ambitious revisions now.  He urged that  the budget be rejected at its first reading for failing to  address structural reforms, complaining in particular about the  high levels of investment in agriculture and the fuel and energy  complex at the expense of technology-intensive industries and a  military conversion program, without which, he contends, it will  be impossible to "break the dangerous trends" in the production  slump (Delovoy Mir, 7 April; Segodnya, 14 April).  Like Zadornov,  Glazyev has emphasized the need to start working on the 1995  budget, but, unlike his colleague, was willing to finish 1994  without a budget, continuing the ad hoc quarterly budget approval  practice employed in recent years (Segodnya, 14 April).      Major Amendments Rebuffed      Anticipating that the Duma would attempt major revisions on the  second reading, especially in the defense allocation, Zadornov  made clear that his committee would brook no amendments altering  the basic revenue and expenditure guidelines approved on the  first reading.  Zadornov successfully proposed that the Duma  reject "automatically" any of the almost 300 proposed amendments  that would change the budget's basic parameters (Segodnya, 8  June).  Rybkin evidently supported Zadornov's goal and reportedly  delayed the start of the budget discussion to meet with the heads  of all factions behind closed doors, where he proposed that the  Duma vote on all amendments endorsed by the budget committee as a  package (Radio Ekho Moskvy, 8 june).      The combined efforts of Zadornov and Rybkin successfully thwarted  attempts by the Defense and Economic Policy committees to  increase the defense budget to R55 trillion.  Projecting that the  government would gain R28.6 trillion in additional revenues from  the sale of state property in the post-voucher phase of  privatization, Glazyev's committee called for allocating an  additional R18 trillion to defense (ITAR-TASS, 25 May; Segodnya,  27, 28 May; Novaya Yezhednevnaya Gazeta, 8 june).  Zadornov's  committee treated that revenue projection with suspicion,  contending that any "excess" revenues would "hardly exceed R3  trillion," but agreed to create an off-budget fund for  privatization receipts earmarked for the military (Segodnya, 28  May, 8 june).  Defense Committee Chairman Sergey Yushenkov  (Russia's Choice) cited Glazyev's revenue projections when he  stated at a press conference that his committee would "insist" on  increasing the defense budget from R37 trillion to R55 trillion,  adding for good measure that the higher figure had "practically  been agreed upon by the president, the Government, and the  Security Council" (Interfax, Moscow NTV, 19 May) (see box 4).      How the Factions Voted      The Duma approved the budget on the second reading by only one  vote above the required majority, 227 to 40 (32 abstentions),  with most of the support coming from left-wing, nationalist, and  centrist factions, while reformers either abstained or voted  against (Krasnaya Zvezda, Izvestiya, 16 june):      -- Left-Wing Factions.  An analysis of the 8 june budget vote  conducted by the "Information Analysis Group" under the  leadership of Aleksandr Sobyanin (Izvestiya, 16 june) indicates  that the budget received the highest proportional support from  the Agrarian and Women of Russia factions, followed by the  Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF) faction.  Appearing to view a viable budget as a necessary tool of  government, CPRF leader Gennadiy Zyuganov called the budget's  adoption "the logic of common sense" (Radio Ekho Moskvy, 8 june).  Suggesting, however, that the Agrarian-CPRF alliance in the Duma  may break down when agrarian and military-industrial interests  are placed in direct competition, 95 percent of Agrarian deputies  voted for the budget--including Rybkin--while only 73 percent of  the CPRF faction did so.      -- Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR).  The faction's 42  votes (of 64 members) for the budget (Izvestiya, 16 june),  despite the modest defense allocation, appear to reflect the  capriciousness and inconsistency with which party leader Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy approaches politics.  Before the first reading  Zhirinovskiy vowed to vote against the budget unless Yeltsin  dismissed Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, privatization tsar  Anatoliy Chubays, and Interior Minister Viktor Yerin (Interfax,  ITAR-TASS, 15 April), but then he flip-flopped and encouraged  faction members to vote for it on the first reading (Russian TV,  13 May).  Zhirinovskiy's move to support the budget appeared to  reflect his resistance to attempts by reformist factions to  defeat it, explaining to journalists: "If the initiative to vote  the budget down was ours, we would vote.  But we do not want to  help the [Yabloko] faction and Russia's Choice remove this  government and take its place.  We will remove this government in  the fall, but we will do it for ourselves" (ITAR-TASS, 13 May).  Zhirinovskiy's absence on the day of the vote may have helped the  budget's passage, relieving the Duma of his usual  obstreperousness.      -- New Regional Policy (NRP).  The pro-industry NRP, whose  members are largely elected from districts and are therefore more  sensitive to constituents' localized concerns than deputies  elected from party lists, also voted against the budget.  According to Sobyanin, only 28 percent of the faction's members  voted for the budget, the lowest percentage of any faction except  the reformist Russia's Choice and Yabloko bloc (Izvestiya, 16  june).  Indicating that, like the Federation Council, the NRP is  concerned about maintaining local defense industries, faction  leader Vladimir Medvedev said before the vote that the NRP would  vote for the budget only if the defense allocation was increased  to R55 trillion (Interfax, 7 june).  The faction recently allied  itself with former Security Council Chairman Yuriy Skokov,  chairman of the Federation of Russian Commodity Producers.  According to media accounts of a "secret" meeting on 17 May,  Skokov and NRP deputies reportedly explored avenues of  cooperation, resulting in an agreement signed by Medvedev and  Skokov on "devising common approaches to political and economic"  issues and "resolving urgent problems at the federal and regional  level" (Obshchaya Gazeta, 20 May; Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 28 May).      -- Russia's Choice.  The decision by many faction members to  follow faction leader Yegor Gaydar's lead in abstaining appears  to reflect a compromise between the faction's conviction that the  budget was seriously flawed and its reluctance to vote the budget  down and possibly endanger Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's  Government.  Only 11 out of 74 Russia's Choice deputies (15  percent) voted for the budget, among them Foreign Minister  Kozyrev.  Reflecting the faction's views of the budget's flaws,  Gaydar has criticized the "high level of military spending,"  system of regional transfer payments that he contends  "subsidize[s] the south at the expense of the north," excessive  subsidies to "inefficient" coal mining and agriculture, and  insufficient funding of science, education, and culture  (Izvestiya, 26 May; Radio Rossii, 8 june).      -- Yabloko.  In a strong show of unity, only one Yabloko member  voted for the budget, a reflection of faction leader Grigoriy  Yavlinskiy's opposition to the economic reform priorities pursued  by Yeltsin since 1992.  Yavlinskiy has objected to the  government's use of "monetarist instruments" for managing the  economy and for attempting deregulation in an economy where  monopolies still dominate.  He also supports a more activist  structural policy that favors investment in technology-intensive  industries that can produce output for export and in what he  considers the "driving sectors of the economy"--aircraft  building, the oil industry, construction materials, and housing  (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 16 April).      Implications      The budget's adoption--a signal by both parliamentary chambers of  their acquiescence to the government's economic policy--may mark  a milestone in Russia's political reform process, formally  transforming some of Yeltsin's critics into players in  determining policy and bringing an unprecedented openness to the  debate on the country's military spending.  In casting their  votes in favor of the budget, some of Yeltsin's harshest critics  from the nationalist opposition, especially the CPRF and LDPR,  now have accepted a shared responsibility for the plight of the  military.  Their vote--which the military newspaper Krasnaya  Zvezda (16 june) construed as a vote against an "adequate defense  budget"--may undercut their criticisms of Yeltsin's security  policy and weaken their support among military personnel.  The  unprecedented debate carried out in the country's press and  broadcast media on the military budget has probably drawn new  public attention to the question of how much defense the country  can afford, and, during a period of widespread economic hardship,  possibly reduced sympathy for the Ministry of Defense's attempts  to protect servicemen.  The Defense Minis try itself may in the  future find that it has to expand its lobbying efforts beyond the  government and the Duma's Defense Committee to gain legislative  votes, a move that could further open up defense policymaking to  legislative influence.      The legislature's lenient treatment of the 1994 budget may not,  however, accurately foreshadow the 1995 budget process.  The  Federal Assembly passed the 1994 budget quickly and with  relatively few changes largely because of Rybkin's unwillingness  to let the Duma defeat it, Duma Budget Committee Chairman  Zadornov's efforts to institutionalize the budget process and get  away from the ad hoc quarterly budgets of recent years, and the  Federation Council's surprisingly rapid abandonment of its  opposition.  With the experience of one budget behind it and more  time to work on the 1995 budget, the legislature may be more  forceful in its future efforts to effect changes in the  government's economic policy.   Box 1                             The 1994 Budget Process     In March the Duma adopted special procedures for considering and  adopting the 1994 budget, reducing the duration of the budget  hearings and authorizing the Budget, Finance, Banking, and  Finance Committee to coordinate and expedite the amendment  process to make up for the delay in the government's submission  of the budget  (ITAR-TASS, 23 March; Rossiyskiye Vesti, 25  March).  The 1994 budget went through the following steps:      18 March -- Premier Chernomyrdin submitted the government's draft  budget to the State Duma.      23 March -- The Duma determined procedures for reviewing the  draft.      15 April -- The Duma began preliminary hearings on the budget  with Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin formally presenting  the government's draft.  The Duma adopted the budget "in  principle" in a vote of 225-57, 21 abstentions (Interfax, 15  April), thus beginning the formal review process.      11 May -- The Duma approved the budget's basic parameters in a  first reading vote of 237-77, 12 abstentions (Rossiyskaya Gazeta,  7 june).  After the first reading the budget was sent to  committees for detailed review.  As stipulated in the procedures  adopted in March, the budget committee has responsibility for  coordinating all amendments proposed by the committees and  recommending their adoption or rejection at the budget's second  reading.      8 june -- The Duma approved the budget on the second reading,  after which, according to the Duma's regulations, no further  amendments can be introduced.      22 june -- The Duma was scheduled to vote on the budget on the  third and last reading, but despite Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin's  prediction that it would be a "formal" vote on the law's  "juridical" language (Interfax, 9 june), the budget went down in  defeat in three separate attempts (Interfax, ITAR-TASS, 22 june).      24 june -- The Duma held a repeat vote for the third reading,  passing the budget 273-80, 8 abstentions (ITAR-TASS, 24 june).  The Duma then passed the budget immediately to the Federation  Council, despite rules giving it five days to forward the bill to  the upper house.  The Federation Council also adopted the budget  the same day.      After the budget's approval by the Federation Council, it is  forwarded to President Yeltsin for his signature.   End Box 1   Box 2                Federation Council Leaders on Record Opposing Budget      Prior to the suprise 24 June vote in favor of the budget,  Federation Council leaders had suggested that the upper chamber  would reject the budget on the grounds that the modest defense  allocation would hurt regions economically dependent on large  defense industries.  Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko predicted after  the Duma's first reading that the Federation Council would reject  the budget because rejection was "in the interests of Russia's  regions" (ITAR-TASS, 18 May).  At a conference of regional  legislative leaders after the second reading, Shumeyko emphasized  the importance of a large defense budget for the regions, stating  that "for 33 regions, the defense sector forms the basis of their  industry" (Ostankino TV, 11 June).  In attacking the Duma's  adoption of the budget, Shumeyko has contended that the Duma  represents narrow party interests while the regions--represented  in the Federation Council-- " reflect the real state of affairs in  Russia" (Ostankino TV, 11 June).  On a more strident note, he  even darkly implied that the Duma's "political set up" makes it  interested in destabilizing the political situation, and its vote  on the budget reveals its thinking that "the worse [the situation  is], the better; we'll change the authorities more quickly"*  (Moscow NTV, 9 June)      Although less strident than Shumeyko, who may be pursuing his own  political ambitions, other Federation Council leaders appeared to  share his views.  The chamber's budget and finance committee  chairman, Nikolay Gonchar, stated that the Duma's modest defense  allocation "will bring the manufacturing industries of [33 of  Russia's] regions to their knees" (Interfax, 9 June).  Similarly,  Defense and Security Committee Chairman Petr Shirshov claimed  that increasing the defense budget would benefit 33 regions and  warned that the R37 trillion allocated by the Duma for defense  will prevent the military from replacing obsolescent equipment  and force cuts in training and exercises (Krasnaya Zvezda, 9  june).  Suggesting that the chamber as a whole shared its  leaders' views, the Federation Council adopted a decree on 2 June  calling for an increase in expenditures of R23 trillion,  including a R55 trillion outlay for defense, but support for the  decree was hard to gauge since the media were not observed to  report a vote total (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 3 june).      * In what appears to have been a misrepresentation of Yeltsin's  position, presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov also implied  that the Duma's disinclination to approve the higher defense  allocation was an attempt to foment friction between Yeltsin and  the military.  Kostikov quoted Yeltsin as saying that the Duma's  defense allocation was "not adequate enough," and Kostikov  remarked that it was a "ploy . . . to put the Army on a ration so  as to bring it into a head-on collision with the president"  (Interfax, 19 May).   End Box 2   Box 3                    Military Lobbying Efforts Faulted      Senior Russian military officials, apparently confident that the  Duma would increase the armed forces budget allocation from the  recommended R37 trillion to R55 trillion, reportedly were stunned  when the Duma refused to approve the increase on the budget's  first reading on 11 May (Kommersant-Daily, 14 May).  Despite what  one television reporter termed a "furious" lobbying effort  following the 11 May vote (Moscow NTV, 22 May), the military was  unable to secure enough votes to significantly increase the  defense allocation before the budget was approved on its second  reading on 8 June.  Russian media have attributed the failure to  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's poor lobbying tactics and the  military media's ineffectiveness in generating public sympathy  for the armed forces.      Grachev's Performance Criticized      According to Kommersant-Daily (14 May), some Defense Ministry  officials said Grachev made a "strategic mistake" in relying too  heavily on the apparent support of President Boris Yeltsin and  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.  "Certain" that a favorable  defense budget would be approved with their support, commentator  Ilya Bulavinov wrote, Grachev "left the parliament completely out  of his considerations."  The result was "a situation where  virtually no one defended the military's interests in the State  Duma."  Even the Defense Ministry newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda (7  June) suggested that military lobbying had failed.  Parliamentary  reporter Vladimir Yermolin, noting that lobbying "is a relatively  new phenomenon in our life," suggested that reasoned arguments  are not enough--" the main thing is to get busy with your elbows;  the army has not learned this yet."  Grachev's ineffective  lobbying may also result from his alleged reluctance to engage  the Duma on other issues.  According to the government newspaper  Rossiyskiye Vesti (21 June), legislators--including Defense  Committee Deputy Chairman Yevgeniy Loginov--have often complained  about Grachev's preference for sending subordinates to meet with  Duma members rather than attending himself.      Indeed, in his own statements Grachev suggests that the military  saw its main enemy in the budget battle as the Finance Ministry-  -not the Duma--and leaves the impression that he regards  political trench warfare as beneath him.  On the eve of the  budget fight, Grachev suggested that within the government "only  the Finance Ministry" was "insisting" on the recommended defense  budget (Interfax, 17 March).  Similarly, in an 18 March interview  with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, Grachev said that  "unless the Finance Ministry yields," the Russian military would  become "an army of unemployed men."  In the same interview,  Grachev provides a clue to his attitude toward lobbying: "I do  not want to make any threats, nor do I intend to humiliate myself  by begging.  At government meetings I put forward concrete  figures so that it is clear where such a policy [the Finance  Ministry's proposed budget] could lead us."      Military Media Castigated      In addition to the lobbying efforts of senior Defense Ministry  officials, the ministry's public relations arm--especially its  radio and television studio*--has since its inception in late  1992 been trying to generate public support for the military's  interests by airing programs that highlight the plight of the  average serviceman, especially lack of housing and low pay.  With  the military's budget failure in the Duma, the effort seems to  have fallen victim to internal recriminations and second  guessing:      -- According to Komsomolskaya Pravda (26 May), the ministry's  Central Radio and Television Broadcasting Studio was subjected to  severe internal criticism following the Duma's first budget vote.  The article claimed that Gen. Vladimir Kosarev, the chief of the  ministry's Information and Press Directorate, which oversees the  ministry's studio, "came down like a ton of bricks" on the studio  for failure to "give wide and full representation . . . of the  process of developing the Russian army" and accused the studio of  "financial irregularities" and "nepotism."  Kosarev also  reportedly called for replacing the studio leadership with "more  experienced cadres."      -- While not mentioning the studio's performance explicitly,  Krasnaya Zvezda suggested that publicizing the plight of Russian  servicemen does not elicit much sympathy from an already  impoverished people.  A 9 June article by Yermolin questioned the  need "to paint a vivid picture" of army life.  "In a country  where the majority of the population only just makes ends meet,  people are no longer shocked by the notion of a poverty stricken  officer."  In another article on 10 June, Yermolin acknowledged  that "no one was shaken" by portrayals of "the problems faced by  the army, by officers and their families, and of the tragedy of  the defense industry."      * The ministry's radio and television studio produces a number of  programs that air regularly on national and regional radio and  television networks as well as through the military's own  broadcasting outlets.  The studio also contributes to civilian  news programs, such as Vesti and Novosti.   End Box 3   Box 4                Yeltsin, Chernomyrdin Lukewarm Toward Military      President Yeltsin apparently offered little more than verbal  support to the military's effort to raise defense spending to R55  trillion.  In response to a March memorandum from Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev warning of the inadequacy of the planned  defense budget, Yeltsin only tepidly endorsed the military's  position, reportedly writing that he "share[d] the defense  minister's concern' (Izvestiya, 12 May).  However, it was not  until the day before the budget's first reading that Yeltsin  reportedly sent a message to Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin saying  "I consider it expedient to agree" with the R55 trillion  allocation (Interfax, 10 May).      After the second reading, when it was clear that the Communists,  Agrarians, and even a majority of the Liberal Democratic Party of  Russian (LDPR) faction--the very factions that have so frequently  accused Yeltsin of destroying the army--had voted for the more  modest defense allocation, Yeltsin evidently saw little need to  fight for the military.  At his Independence Day press  conference, Yeltsin indicated that the military would have to  learn to live within its budget and criticized the armed forces  for not making cuts "more energetically."  He indicated that  Russia could not support the 3-million-strong army of the former  Soviet Union and also said there "must be some reduction" in  defense industry orders (Russian TV, 10 June).  To that end, he  has reportedly drafted a presidential edict that will reduce  state orders to defense enterprises (ITAR-TASS, 18 June).      The military also failed to find an ally in Premier Chernomyrdin,  who demonstrated a commitment to fiscal restraint with the 1994  budget.  During the Duma's first reading of the budget,  Chernomyrdin cautioned deputies that "only a strictly balanced  budget can mobilize the market" and emphasized that the  government's deficit target would ensure that inflation is kept  "under control" (ITAR-TASS, 11 May).  At a meeting of the Russian  Government Presidium the following day, Chernomyrdin acknowledged  that the defense budget was an "important problem" and said that  the government "shall back the military-industrial complex," but  he stopped short of endorsing increased funding (ITAR-TASS, 12  May).  Moreover, Chernomyrdin is reportedly prepared to seek  further cuts in allocations for the military, including  abolishing credits for military housing construction, one of the  Defense Ministry's highest priority programs (Moskovskiy  Komsomolets, 18 May).

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Yugoslav PM backs army role in crisis YUGOSLAVIA'S army was last night given full backing by Mr Ante Markovic, the prime minister, in an attempt to stop the spread of ethnic conflict which has brought the country to the brink of civil war. At the same time, he called for the disarming of all citizens following last week's violent clashes between Serbs and Croats which left 18 dead. His move came as Britain sought a European-wide initiative to resolve the crisis. It has asked its European Community partners to consider a possible mediating role for the 34-member Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. All the EC countries are members of CSCE, which also includes the Soviet Union, Canada and the US. Meanwhile, Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, appealed for an end to violence as a means of solving the ethnic disputes, the worst since the Second World War. Mr Markovic, who presented his five-point plan to the federal government, said: 'Conditions should be created for the Yugoslav People's Army to act according to the constitution and the federal law to carry out its basic functions - the defence of the borders, and in this situation, it is also to stop inter-ethnic armed conflict.' The army has wanted to impose a state of emergency. However, this requires the consent of the collective presidency - consisting of representatives from the six republics and two provinces - which so far has refused. The deadlock has encouraged some army factions to consider imposing martial law. Admiral Stane Brovet, the deputy defence minister, warned parliament yesterday that the army was losing patience. Mr Markovic's statement is aimed at a compromise between the army and the presidency. By spelling out the role of the army, he may hope to win constitutional backing for the military to quash unrest, but not impose a state of emergency. He said that 'any attempts (by the republic or individuals) to change 'the internal or external borders of the country' would not be tolerated. The crisis has been sparked by sharp political differences between Croats and Serbs, the country's two largest ethnic groups. Britain's mediation attempt, to be put formally to the EC's foreign affairs council in Brussels next Tuesday, will be the first concerted international attempt to try to provide Yugoslavia with a forum to find way to resolve its problems. However, any efforts to convene a meeting of the CSCE countries will require the consent of Yugoslavia. Nationalism in Croatia, Page 2</p>

The Muscovites have developed the technological part of the  project for the future enterprise and handed over the blueprints  to representatives of the client -- the "Azerkyzyl"  ("Azerzoloto") state company. This was announced by "Azerkyzyl"  Vice President Valis Ismaylov. "Geotep," he noted, has assumed  the purchase of specialized equipment and its delivery to the  construction site.    Predicted gold reserves in Azerbaijan are assessed at 1,500  tonnes. At the same time other precious metals, silver in  particular, will be mined with it.    The planned capacity of the first gold extracting plant is  five tonnes of ingots a year. It will be possible to reach this  level three to four years after the launch of the enterprise.</p>

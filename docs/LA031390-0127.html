			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY AND FRIENDS SAY FINAL GOODBY TO MURDERED 3-YEAR-OLD  </P> <P> About 40 friends and family members gathered under cold, blustery skies in this  Riverside County community Monday to say goodby to Marcelline Onick, a  3-year-old Fullerton girl who was stabbed to death in her home.  </P> <P> After a brief, closed-casket memorial service at the Evans-Brown Mortuary,  mourners journeyed to Perris Valley Cemetery on the outskirts of town and  gathered around her grave site as the Rev. Robert Town of Jacob's Well  Christian Centre in Fullerton offered final words. The girl was buried with her  favorite white unicorn toy and a red rose.  </P> <P> "We need to understand that Marcelline is still alive. Marcelline is in the  arms of Jesus," Town said. "We are here to commit the body of this dear child,  (and) it is a tragedy. But this child will be with Christ for millions and  millions and millions of years."  </P> <P> As Town spoke from a wooden lectern, Joanne Boydston, mother of Marcelline, and  Christopher Onick, the child's father, huddled on a bench facing the  flower-laden white casket. Boydston cried softly while her estranged husband  stared at the ground.  </P> <P> The words did little to console family and friends who just nine days earlier  had endured the shock of learning that Marcelline -- known affectionately as  "Pooh Bear" -- was dead from multiple stab wounds.  </P> <P> Michael Robert Pacewitz, 21, an unemployed painter from Fullerton, said in a  jailhouse interview last week that he killed Marcelline while baby-sitting her  and Boydston's infant son. He also said he stabbed and slightly wounded his  mother and her boyfriend in an Anaheim apartment the night before.  </P> <P> Although Pacewitz's name was not mentioned during the funeral service, a  current of anger over the slaying surfaced a couple of times. Onick punched a  wall in anger after viewing the body of his daughter. The casket's lid had been  raised briefly for those wishing a final look.  </P> <P> And, at the grave site, Marcelline's godmother, Viola Bowie, lost her temper  after being asked a question about Pacewitz.  </P> <P> "I'm hurting with anger, but I'm leaving him in God's hands," said Bowie, of  Lawndale. "God is going to get his tail! We cannot punish him like God will."  </P> <P> Drawing a deep breath, Bowie added: "Marcelline was a living angel. Lucifer  himself must have crawled out of hell and gone into that girl's apartment that  night."  </P> <P> Pacewitz, in Orange County Jail pending arraignment Thursday on charges of  murder and attempted murder, said that he killed Marcelline and stabbed his  mother and her boyfriend because the devil wanted him to do it.  </P> <P> Orange County Superior Court records obtained Monday show that he was on  probation at the time of the murder for a misdemeanor charge of possession of  stolen property.  </P> <P> Funeral-goers tried not to dwell on the tragedy of Marcelline's death, and  instead recalled her as a fun-loving, happy little girl.  </P> <P> "She was a doll," Steven Campos, a family friend and fellow church member, said  in a eulogy. "She was always really hyper. She'd be jumping on the couch, and  she'd want to play hide-and-seek."  </P> <P> Campos, 23, drew laughter when he added jokingly: "She's giving God a hard time  up there."  </P> <P> Staff writer Wendy Paulson contributed to this story.  </P></p>

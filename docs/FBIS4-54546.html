			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] In constituencies where the Social Democratic  Party of Hungary [MSZDP] has not put forward its own candidates,  it is going to support the Hungarian Socialist Party. Edit  Schranz reports:    [Schranz] The MSZDP wants to establish a strong left wing in  Hungary. Without a strong left wing, serious decisions cannot  be made in parliament. Moreover, should the occasion arise, a  strong left wing is needed to govern the country, party Chairman  Zoltan Kiraly said. [passage omitted]    The MSZDP is planning to make a decision on where and with  whom to conclude election agreements in the second round of the  elections at its presidium meeting to be held on 14 May. In  connection with this, Zoltan Kiraly also revealed that, with the  exception of left and right extremists, they might conclude  election agreements with other parties, including liberal  parties. For that matter, the party asks the voters to vote for  the Socialists' list in constituencies where the MSZDP does not  have a party list in the first round, the chairman said.

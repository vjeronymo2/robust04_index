			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Electrical retailing Offer's conclusion that the regional electricity companies are perfectly at liberty to lose money in retailing is curious, but wholly sensible. Offer has no business determining what strategy the Recs pursue in non-regulated areas - so long as it does not impinge on their core businesses. Despite the embarrassingly large scale of the Recs' retailing losses, there are few grounds for such worry at present. Nevertheless, the OFT's encouragement of greater transparency of accounting and market testing is a welcome attempt to ensure fair competition. It is a shame some Recs are proving recalcitrant. Whether the Recs' shareholders should remain so sanguine is a different matter. The Pounds 105m of retailing losses they have accumulated is alarming. Yet, unlike the water companies, the Recs have a partial defence against the charge of wanton diversification, considering they inherited most of their retailing interests when privatised. Most are now withdrawing. Yet Norweb is pressing ahead with an aggressive expansion programme. It will struggle to generate serious money from it, however. Electrical retailing is a tricky business, thanks to severe price disinflation for gizmos and fierce competition. If Dixons can make precious little money out of electrical retailing - excluding contributions from its highly-profitable warrants - it seems unlikely Norweb will do much better.</p>

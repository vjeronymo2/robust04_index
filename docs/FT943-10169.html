			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Rise in bond prices pressures the Nikkei A rise in bond prices to a 14-month high prompted worries over fund allocation by institutional investors, and share prices lost ground as dealers adjusted their positions and individuals took profits, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 fell 155.14 to 20,521.70 after a high of 20,680.94 and a low of 20,467.49. Domestic institutions had buying orders just below the 20,500 level, preventing a sharp slide in prices, but traders also noted sell orders around 20,700. Volume totalled 269m shares, against 270m. Arbitrage buying and purchases by overseas investors supported low-priced issues, but share prices declined on small lot selling by dealers. Traders were also worried that the rise in the yield on the 10-year benchmark bond above 4.6 per cent would attract some institutional investors from the equity market. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 6.78 to 1,649.74, while the Nikkei 300 sank 1.30 to 299.44. Losers led gainers by 659 to 317 with 193 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.04 to 1,336.87. Profit-taking depressed electrical stocks and Hitachi fell Y20 to Y1,000; but overseas investors bought steel companies and Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, rose Y2 to Y363. NKK advanced Y5 to Y279. Ricoh, the office automation equipment maker, jumped Y26 to Y960. Investors were encouraged by the Yamaichi Research Institute's first ever top rating of 1 for the company, which has been cutting costs through restructuring measures. DDI, the telecommunications company, saw active demand following its ten-for-one stock split. The issue rose an effective Y62,000 to Y991,000. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 88.59 to 22,922.67 in volume of 72.2m shares. Roundup Fears of a further rise in US interest rates weighed on a number of the region's markets. HONG KONG fell back as investors took profits on a number of blue-chip stocks following renewed fears of a rise in US interest rates. The Hang Seng index lost 40.64 to 9,602.21, but up from an intraday low of 9,562.41. The market rose 1.3 per cent last week. Brokers said that local and foreign investors engaged in selective selling to hedge positions ahead of the weekend and Friday's US jobs data. SHANGHAI's domestic market saw another substantial rise with the A index rising 22 per cent to 700.58. Its gain on the week was 108 per cent. By contrast the B index added 2.5 per cent to 74.40. Turnover was Yn10.49bn. SINGAPORE rose slightly on expectations of good second quarter economic growth data due to be announced next week. The Straits Times Industrials index rose 1.95 to 2,273.12, a 3 per cent improvement on the week. Turnover rose to SDollars 531.6m from SDollars 487.2m. TAIPEI rose 1.9 per cent on the day on strong buying in the electronic and plastic sectors. The weighted index put on 129.64 to 6,919.21, 2.5 per cent on the week. Turnover soared to TDollars 123.2bn from Thursday's TDollars 85.3bn. SEOUL rose as investors renewed their interest in selective blue chips, shares with low price/earnings ratios and some banking issues. The composite stock index added 8.33 to 935.82, off a day's high of 943.48, and up 0.2 per cent on the week. KUALA LUMPUR improved as speculative stocks soared in the afternoon, led by Idris Hydraulic which added 45 cents to MDollars 5.55. Analysts said that optimism was fuelled by hopes for an announcement of an early general election. The composite index added 2.35 to 1,089.15, for a 6 per cent advance on the week. SYDNEY saw bargain hunting of blue chips push the market to a higher close in spite of a sharp fall on Wall Street overnight. BHP climbed 10 cents to a record close of ADollars 19.60: it is expected to rise further next week amid buying enthusiasm related to the expansion of key projects. The All Ordinaries index finished 8.4 stronger at 2,091.9, up 1.5 per cent on the week.</p>

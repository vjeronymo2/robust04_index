			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BUSH TO BACK CONGRESSIONAL PAY RAISES  </P> <P> The White House said Friday that President Bush will support a new attempt on  Capitol Hill to get a pay raise for members of Congress, federal officials and  judges.  </P> <P> "We're just waiting for them to give us a package," press secretary Marlin  Fitzwater said. "We'll be supportive if the Congress produces any reasonable  proposal."  </P> <P> Fitzwater said Bush would like to see any pay raise tied to a package of  ethical standards that would prohibit lawmakers from accepting honorariums --  fees for speeches, public appearances and writing.  </P> <P> House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and Minority Leader Robert H. Michel  (R-Ill.) met with Bush last week to discuss pay raises, Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> Foley and Michel both back a pay-raise proposal, made by a bipartisan task  force, that would phase in a 35% salary boost over two years, according to  congressional aides. The plan also would include changes in Congress' ethics  rules, including new restrictions on members' speaking honorariums.  </P> <P> A Democratic leadership aide said Friday that "no final decision has been made"  on moving a pay raise this year, but the meeting with Bush was sought because  "presidential support would be essential" if lawmakers go ahead with a salary  plan.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIR-FARE WAR TAKES OFF ON ROUTES IN STATE  </P> <P> A fare war broke out Thursday among airlines serving major California cities,  giving consumers discount air fares not seen since the days before PSA and  AirCal were bought by major carriers.  </P> <P> The intensified competition in the nation's busiest air corridor between  Southern and Northern California came as American Airlines slashed fares and  other big carriers said they will match them.  </P> <P> American's new discount fares -- as low as $29 one-way between Northern  California and Ontario Airport in San Bernardino County -- spurred other big  carriers, including USAir and United Airlines, to say they will match them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'We Will Match It'  </P> <P> "Where we compete with American, we will match it," a United spokesman said.  USAir said it would announce details of matching fares today.  </P> <P> American is not the first carrier in recent months to announce low fares on  limited routes in the California market. But American's announcement is the  first wide-scale price cut, particularly on the Los Angeles-to-San Francisco  route. Its new fares go into effect May 1.  </P> <P> American put most emphasis on its $98, seven-day advanced purchase, round-trip  fare from Los Angeles International, Burbank and Orange County to San Francisco  or San Jose. Those are the most popular routes that "we think peo ple will pay  attention to," American spokesman Ed Stewart said. Those routes will also  feature a new, one-day advanced purchase fare of $118 round trip.  </P> <P> Currently, the lowest seven-day advanced purchase fare for major carriers  flying between Los Angeles and San Francisco is $124 round trip. The regular  unrestricted fare is $296 round trip.  </P> <P> "This is best for the average person, and the smaller companies on very tight  budgets will obviously benefit," said Gordon Erenberg, manager of the Ask Mr.  Foster travel agency in Century City.  </P> <P> Business travelers -- the most frequent fliers along the busy routes -- were  among the most vocal last winter when major carriers raised fares. In  particular, some businesses were pleased to see a cut in the rate for one-day  advanced purchase. "It's better than it was; it's been costing us $296," said  Nancy Godfrey, travel manager for Chevron Oil Co.  </P> <P> "If the client is flexible, how can you beat it," said Marilyn Rosensweig, an  agent with Century 21 Travel in Tarzana. Passengers always benefit from  discounting that affects several airlines, she said, "but the problem is with  people who buy tickets in advance and have to cancel. The rules are so  restrictive and they don't always remember what you told them about the  restrictions."  </P> <P> Mike Heffer, senior staff member of San Francisco-based Consumer Action, said  the fare restrictions dampen the good news somewhat because many people  traveling between San Francisco and Los Angeles can't make advanced  reservations, but "we certainly welcome any sign of price competition in the  San Francisco-Los Angeles market. It's been a long time coming."  </P> <P> There are more than 200 flights a day between Northern and Southern California,  shuttling thousands of people between the state's population centers.  </P> <P> While most carriers are expected to match the fares, airline industry analysts  said they do not believe that the discounting signals the beginning of a  protracted and vicious fare war.  </P> <P> "Everyone loses in a fare war. No one is more conscious of that than American,"  said Edmond Greenslet, an analyst with ESG Aviation Services in Greenwich,  Conn.  </P> <P> "This is a local tactic, not a broad-based strategy," he said, explaining that,  generally, air fares are rising throughout the nation.  </P> <P> American has a smaller share of the intrastate market than United or USAir, he  said. "American is under no illusion that they won't match the fare, but the  advantage is that it gives American name recognition and it buys them good  will," he said.  </P> <P> American has also recently established a new hub at San Jose in an attempt to  make it an alternative to San Francisco, he said. The fare announcement is  "part of a marketing strategy to heighten attention to San Jose," he added.  </P> <P> American's Stewart said, "The bottom line is that this is what our marketing  folks said we had to do to remain competitive."  </P> <P> The first fare cutting began with Dallas-based Southwest Airlines. It announced  a $98 unrestricted, round-trip fare, beginning on May 15, for flights between  Ontario and Oakland and San Diego and Oakland. It will also offer a $58, 21-day  advanced purchase ticket for those routes.  </P> <P> American's announcement is "their reaction to our introductory fares," said  Charlotte Goddard, a Southwest spokesman.  </P> <P> In addition to the other reductions, American is matching Southwest's fares  with the $58, 21-day advanced purchase ticket between Northern California and  Ontario, and between Orange County and San Jose.  </P> <P> It will also offer an unrestricted $198 round-trip fare between Burbank and San  Jose; Los Angeles International and San Francisco or San Jose; and from Orange  County to San Francisco or San Jose. However, the fare will be available for  only a limited number of seats on each flight, Stewart said.  </P> <P> California consumers have seen steadily increasing rates for intrastate travel  since USAir bought PSA and American bought AirCal in 1987. Rates rose  throughout the country as deregulation spurred a wave of airline mergers,  decreasing competition. When PSA was purchased, consumers could buy a  full-fare, round-trip ticket between San Francisco and Los Angeles for $140.  </P> <P> In addition to increases last year, the major carriers in January raised fares  an additional 15%, bringing the regular Los Angeles-San Francisco round-trip  fare to $296.  </P></p>

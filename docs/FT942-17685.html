			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / International Company News: TWA reduces losses after cut-back TWA, the US airline which emerged from bankruptcy last November, narrowed its operating losses to Dollars 281.3m last year, from Dollars 404.6m in 1992, as it cut back the scale of its operations. However, a Dollars 342m pension fund charge, offset by some items resulting from the company's reorganisation, led it to report a pre-tax loss (before extraordinary items) of Dollars 450.8m, compared with Dollars 342m in 1992.</p>

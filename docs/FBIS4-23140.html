			<p>BFN     [Text] It has been reported from Huambo that raids by  Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party  [MPLA-PT] aircraft continued the whole day yesterday, causing  extensive human and material losses. The MPLA-PT, as in the  past, has directed its murderous fury on civilian wards. Our  correspondent Lourenco Bento says not even National Union for  the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] negotiators' houses  were spared. The house of UNITA Information Secretary Dr. Jorge  Alicerces Valentim, who is currently in Lusaka, was destroyed  yesterday. His family escaped unhurt. At present, crying can  be heard everywhere. The hospitals are unable to cope with the  increasing number of wounded people and face a shortage of  medicines.</p>

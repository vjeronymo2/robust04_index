			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> CARMEN MCRAE HITS HER STRIDE AT CATALINA BAR  </P> <P> Hearing Carmen McRae sing these days is a bit like watching a veteran pitcher  come to the mound in a tight situation. Both may be a bit creaky getting  started, missing a target here and there, not quite in control of the  overpowering talents that got them to the big leagues.  </P> <P> But when the game is on the line, they both come through -- winning because  winning is what they know best. McRae's opening set at Hollywood's Catalina Bar  &amp; Grill on Tuesday night was a perfect example of how this master singer  has adjusted her performing to the inevitable changes that time brings.  </P> <P> Starting somewhat erratically, she moved through standards like "Never Let Me  Go" and "I Concentrate on You" plagued by little lapses of pitch and emphasis,  never quite getting to the centers of the songs. It even appeared, for a few  distressing moments, that her usually dependable skills were being supported by  sheer instincts alone.  </P> <P> When McRae dug into a sensuously swinging duet with bassist Scott Colley on  "Get Out of Town," however, she suddenly blossomed to life, a musical phoenix  rising through the rhythm. Her revival continued with a gorgeous ballad  interpretation of "More Than You Know" (including the lovely verse) and a  scat-filled set of variations on "Old Devil Moon."  </P> <P> From that point on, McRae was in her stride. Two more standards, "For All We  Know" and "Mean to Me," followed -- executed with the precise diction and  crystal-clear musical focus that have been her stocks in trade for nearly four  decades. As a final bit of icing on the cake, McRae closed with an attractive  new song, Brazilian singer-songwriter Djavan's "Upside Down."  </P> <P> Backed by pianist Eric Gunnison, drummer Mark Pulice and bassist Colley,  McRae's performance was a small gem of musical maturity. She continues at  Catalina's through Sunday night. DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

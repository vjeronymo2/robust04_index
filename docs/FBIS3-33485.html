The lawyer started his criminal lawsuit against Economy  Minister Domingo Cavallo, City Mayor Sau Bouer and economist  Miguel Angel Broda, accusing them of having caused a run on the  currency in February, 1991.    Also included in the legal action are the head of the State  Intelligence (SIDE) and the head of Citibank and other foreign  banks, for telephone eavesdropping and conspiring against the  market to make the price of the dollar increase.    The nine pages of the complaint contain articles cut from  books and magazines and newspapers including extracts of the  book El Hacedor, a biography of Cavallo written by journalist  Daniel Santoro which covers the run on the Central Bank  allegedly caused by leaked information that Central Bank  allegedly caused by leaked information that Cavallo had  authorized then Treasury Secretary Saul Bouer to pay off  Treasury bonds with unbacked money if necessary.    Bouer is alleged to have commented on this to economist  Broda, which caused the foreign banks to buy dollars to the  detriment of the Central Bank.    The legal action accuses Cavallo of having raised interest  rates and increased statutory reserve requirements with the  Central Bank to overcome the crisis. Monner Sans also accuses  SIDE of finding out via wire-tapping and not reporting the  matter to the courts.    Bouer is accused of having leaked a state secret and Broda  and the banks are charged with having profited from the deed.</p>

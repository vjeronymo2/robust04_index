			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WATER BOARD LIKELY TO FUND SDG&amp;E STUDY;  </P> <P> MOVE WOULD END MONEY RIFT WITH CITY OVER ATTEMPT TO BLOCK MERGER  </P> <P> In a reversal of their earlier position, County Water Authority officials have  informally agreed to pay $250,000 for a feasibility study on a public takeover  of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co., Mayor Maureen O'Connor announced Tuesday.  </P> <P> The decision, if ratified by the Water Authority's 35-member board of directors  at its Feb. 9 meeting, could end a brief tussle between the Water Authority and  the city of San Diego over who would pay for the study and set the research in  motion.  </P> <P> The agreement was reached in a meeting between O'Connor and Water Authority  Vice Chairman Mike Madigan last Thursday. The session also included Water  Authority General Manager Lester Snow and San Diego City Atty. John Witt.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Full Board OK Is Expected  </P> <P> "It's legal, and we're going to ask the Water Authority to pick up the tab,"  Madigan said in an interview Tuesday, adding, "I think the board will go along  with it."  </P> <P> In a related matter, the San Diego City Council instructed Witt to investigate  allegations of improper contacts between SDG&amp;E and Southern California  Edison -- whose parent company, SCEcorp., is attempting to buy the local  utility for $2.4 billion.  </P> <P> The Utility Consumers Action Network, a San Diego-based consumer group, alleged  Monday that SDG&amp;E is sharing "proprietary information" on power purchases,  transmission-related contracts and purchases of goods and services with Edison,  which remains an SDG&amp;E competitor until a merger is approved.  </P> <P> The accusations came in a request to the state Public Utilities Commission for  an injunction barring the sharing of information in the belief that Edison  would gain a competitive advantage over SDG&amp;E during the 18 months before  the merger either succeeded or fell through, said Michael Shames, UCAN's  executive director.  </P> <P> A published report also indicated that Edison officials have already  participated in some decisions made by SDG&amp;E.  </P> <P> "This alarming development raises serious questions about the legality of such  a decision-making process," said O'Connor, who is leading a high-profile  campaign against the merger. "It seems to us that such actions may seriously  violate legal restrictions imposed by the city's franchises" as well as state  and federal regulations.  </P> <P> Assistant City Atty. Ron Johnson said San Diego has no evidence of impropriety  but was spurred by rumors and allegations to investigate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Accusations Disputed  </P> <P> SDG&amp;E Vice President Jack Thomas called the claims "baloney."  </P> <P> "We are running San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. and making decisions," he  said. "We are abiding precisely with the merger agreement we have with Southern  California Edison Co."  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the Public Utilities Commission said she could not comment on  the allegations, which the commission has not formally received. She said  SDG&amp;E and Edison would have 15 days to respond before the commission  decides whether to hold a hearing on the matter.  </P> <P> Shames said his allegations stem from telephone calls he is receiving from  SDG&amp;E employees and the terms of the merger agreement, which he believes  lacks wording to protect proprietary information.  </P> <P> But Thomas said Shames' claims are "simply not true. We are not exchanging  information with Southern California Edison of a proprietary nature."  </P> <P> Thomas agreed that other decisions have been made jointly since SDG&amp;E's  board of directors agreed to Edison's buyout offer Dec. 1, including a change  in the thrust of an advertising campaign and a switch of articles in a company  newsletter. But he said the policy shifts were legal.  </P> <P> On some matters, "We are not competing with Edison Co. now," he said. "We are  engaged to be married. We've got a wedding here in 18 months.  </P> <P> The spat between San Diego and the Water Authority developed last month after a  preliminary legal opinion from Water Authority attorney Paul Engstrand found  that the agency could not legally finance the study with its money.  </P> <P> After that opinion, the authority's Snow and City Manager John Lockwood met and  agreed to propose that the city fund a study conducted by the water board. On  Dec. 13, the City County voted to lend the Water Authority $250,000 for the  study.  </P> <P> Water Authority directors voted to accept the payment the next day, but said  they considered it a grant, to be repaid if the agency actually took over  SDG&amp;E, which could take years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Water Decision Reversed  </P> <P> The impasse over whether the payment would be a loan or grant remained until  Engstrand reversed himself Jan. 6, ruling that the Water Authority could spend  its money on the feasibility study.  </P> <P> Despite the apparent agreement for the Water Authority to finance the study,  the City Council voted in closed session Tuesday to reaffirm that $225,000 of  the proposed payment would be a loan not a grant, O'Connor said. Councilman Bob  Filner, who opposes having the city finance the study, dissented from the  decision.  </P> <P> Assistant City Atty. Johnson said, "We are not going to change it from a loan  to a grant, but we are offering a loan."  </P></p>

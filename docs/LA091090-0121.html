			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> E. GERMANS WILL SELL SOVIETS $636 MILLION IN SURPLUS GOODS  </P> <P> East Germany's troubled farmers got a break today when the government announced  a $636-million deal to sell food and cigarettes to the shortage-plagued Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> The deal will allow farmers to get rid of some of the unsold produce and meat  that have been jamming storerooms and slaughterhouses in the last several  months.  </P> <P> East German stores have been spurning home-grown goods in favor of Western  products.  </P> <P> About 255,000 tons of meat, 60,000 tons of butter, 5,000 tons of fish and more  than 1 million eggs are included in the estimated $636-million contract with  the Soviet Union, officials said.  </P> <P> Also included in the deal is sales of 1 billion cigarettes. The Soviet Union  has been plagued by unrest over mass shortages of tobacco.  </P> <P> The contract was announced by government officials and West German Agriculture  Minister Ignaz Kiechle, who will be in charge of East Germany's crumbling farm  economy after the two nations unify on Oct. 3.  </P> <P> Officials said deliveries will begin in the next few days and continue through  June.  </P> <P> East German farms -- Soviet-style collectives that are typically over-staffed  -- have been unable to sell enough goods to cover their payrolls and operating  costs since the nation switched to a free market on July 1.  </P></p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Four NY exchanges agree to join Globex THE Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange have won an agreement in principle from four New York commodities exchanges to join as partners in the Globex system. Globex is the international, after-hours electronic trading system that the two Chicago exchanges are developing with Reuters. The Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, the Commodity Exchange, the New York Futures Exchange and the New York Cotton Exchange said they would affiliate with Globex 'subject to resolution of certain outstanding issues and approvals by their boards and the boards of the CBOT and the CME,' according to the announcement made by Mr Leo Melamed, chairman of Globex, at the annual Futures Industry Association meeting in Boca Raton, Florida. Mr Melamed said he could not detail the issues to be ironed out, but contended that these were 'resolvable'. The Matif, the Paris futures exchange, is the only international exchange currently a partner in Globex. Acknowledging the long delays in the launch of Globex, Mr Melamed said: 'It's taken longer than anyone anticipated.' He could not name a precise date for the system to start up, but said it would be operational some time later this year. He was less sanguine about its immediate success, saying: 'It'll take many years'. The New York Mercantile Exchange, the world's largest energy market and the largest of the five New York exchanges, decided last year to develop its own electronic trading system, in co-operation with AT&amp;T, which is known as Access. Nymex, which once had been interested in joining Globex, will also part ways physically with its four New York neighbours, with which it shares a single cramped trading floor. All five had been planning to build a new facility together and possibly merge until Nymex chose last year to go it alone. This latest decision on Globex by the other four will further separate the New York markets.</p>

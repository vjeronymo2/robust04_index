			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> STAGHORN FERNS CAN THRIVE IN SOUTHLAND YARDS  </P> <P> In its native Australia or New Guinea, the staghorn fern grows high in a tree,  drinking in moisture from incessant tropical humidity and rainfall.  </P> <P> But once established, staghorns -- as ferns go -- need relatively little water  and thus are the perfect exotic conversation piece for a Southland garden or  patio.  </P> <P> "The staghorn fern is a pretty hardy soul," says Wade Roberts, garden director  at Sherman Library and Gardens in Corona del Mar.  </P> <P> "It will survive to about 20 degrees. A coastal area is ideal for growing them,  but one can also grow them inland."  </P> <P> Flat, sterile fronds grow at the plant's base to support antler-shaped fertile  fronds that give the plant its striking appearance. Because the staghorn fern  is an epiphyte (a non-parasitic plant that grows on another), it can be mounted  on a board or piece of bark and hung on a tree or a wall.  </P> <P> Though nature's design calls for them to grab all the moisture and nutrients  they need from the air, staghorns benefit from watering and feeding in Southern  California's arid climate.  </P> <P> "Treat the plant like it's raining," says Roberts. You can sprinkle it weekly  with a hose or water wand. Any balanced plant food that is soluble can be  applied monthly when watering, as the staghorn will absorb food and drink  through its foliage.  </P> <P> If the plant is under stress -- too dry, for example -- fertilizing should wait  until it is more robust.  </P> <P> Heat will not hurt the staghorn, he says, but a lack of humidity will. Besides  watering directly, steam up the plant's surroundings by watering the ground  beneath it or using a fogging nozzle, available at nurseries.  </P> <P> Roberts will discuss staghorns and their cousins, moosehorn ferns -- or  Platycerium bifurcatum and P. grande, as botanists know them -- at a program  today at 9:30 a.m. at Sherman Gardens. Presented as part of the facility's  Weekend Gardener series, his lecture will cover the ferns' culture and how to  use them in a garden.  </P> <P> The moosehorn fern must be hung on the appropriate size mounting, Roberts says.  It will probably need remounting three times in its life, ending up on a board  that is perhaps 4 or 5 foot square. Its fuzzy shield fronds face upward to  catch rainfall, dust and whatever falls from the air; from this, the plant  makes its own nourishing compost.  </P> <P> More difficult to grow than the staghorn, the moosehorn is one showy set of  fronds and reproduces by spores.  </P> <P> The staghorn, by contrast, puts out "pups" from its base. They can be left in  place or removed, once they have several shield fronds, and mounted to start a  whole new plant.  </P> <P> "The key is not getting an extremely young little pup," Roberts says, "but to  get one large enough to have enough root to mount on small board and have it  survive."  </P> <P> Make sure it has enough moisture to get established, and it will soon become  tough enough to survive periodic benign neglect.  </P> <P> Though the ferns will grow some clinging roots of their own, they also need  occasional attention to their mountings to ensure that they don't become heavy  and fall. They can be secured to a board or tree with non-copper wire or strong  strips of plastic. New shield fronds will soon cover the wires. Old base fronds  may need to be cut away, but their brown papery appearance is perfectly normal.  </P> <P> As a project for beginning gardeners, Roberts says the staghorn and moosehorn  ferns are "highly recommended."  </P> <P> Among the Platyceriums, "those are the two that the homeowner can grow and have  success with," he says. They are widely available at nurseries; a nursery that  doesn't have them in stock can easily order them.  </P> <P> At his program today, Roberts will demonstrate proper mounting and remounting  of the ferns and explain their care and feeding.

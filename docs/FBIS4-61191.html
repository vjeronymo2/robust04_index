			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sharip Asuyev, Said Bipoyev, and Aleksandr </F> Yevtushenko; date, place of quoted interviews not given:  "Chechnya: Entreaties and Guns. What Language Will Moscow and  Groznyy Use?"]    [Text] From an interview with Dzhokhar Dudayev:    [Dudayev] Two years ago the Chechen republic acquired its  independence. But even now one can say with confidence that my  presidency and our state are coming into being in very  precarious conditions . Although even in these conditions there  is no doubt that the state does exist.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What is your opinion of the activity  of law-enforcement bodies? Do you not think that you are to  blame for the disorganization there?    [Dudayev] This is a problem not only for us but also  throughout the former Union. We have adopted a government  program for combating crime during the transitional period.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What about the parliament? Does it  or does it not exist?    [Dudayev] The deputies are still meeting. (We would remind  you that a few months before the tragic events in Moscow the  same kind of crisis blew up in Chechnya when Dudayev used force  against the opposition in order to retain power. Over 50 people  died then -- editorial note). They are putting all the  parliament's previous work on a legal footing.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What mistakes have you made during  your rule? What reasons do you have to reproach yourself?    [Dudayev] We are a nation today. And the people who trust  in me -- around 80 percent of the population support me -- are  convincing evidence that I have not committed flagrant mistakes  that they regret. I do not know of a single state that does not  want to cooperate with us. So we are pursuing the right policy.    But we cannot agree to the terrorism that is being foisted  on  us by Russia's leadership. We have given no cause for it, and  are not about to. Terrorism is for the weak. We cannot live in  isolation, especially from Russia. But that is what is being  imposed on us, as it was on Albania and Cuba in the past. They  want to create unbearable conditions here so as to arouse  people's indignation and cause the overthrow of the "Dudayev  regime." There is a 100-percent probability that Russia will  try to "have it out" by force with recalcitrant Chechnya.  Russia can do nothing else. When has it refrained from  resolving national issues by force? That is its downfall.  [Dudayev ends]    From an interview with Yaragi Mamodayev, leader of the  Chechen opposition and head of the government of people's  confidence:    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What is your view of the situation in  Chechnya today?    [Mamodayev] To put it briefly, it is worse than in other  regions of the North Caucasus. There are virtually no state  deliveries. Industry -- the backbone of the national economy --  is coming to a standstill. The petroleum complex is on its last  legs. Agriculture has been paralyzed, and most educational  establishments have been closed down. The republic's population  has been reduced to poverty amid wholesale unemployment. And  the few people who are in work have not seen wages for months,  just as pensioners have not seen pensions. Moreover there is a  terrible crime situation, with robberies and banditry. In a  word, there is every sign that we have not a regime, as many  people think, but absolute powerlessness and anarchy.    As for Dudayev's regime, there is a Chechen Constitution  which he has flagrantly violated. There is also a ruling by our  Constitutional Court deeming the president's actions illegal.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What is the reason for your long stay  in Moscow?    [Mamodayev] In theory any of us can go to Groznyy when  necessary and stay there are long as necessary. We have simply  moved away from the republic's internal problems and  concentrated our efforts on resolving foreign policy tasks, in  other words we are working on the future.    In Moscow it is easier for us to establish contacts with  Russian leaders and afford the republic real assistance. At the  same time we are following the general course of building an  independent Chechen state, which accords with the will of our  people.    We realize that the process of acquiring a new state system  is a long and complex one. It cannot be accomplished on  impulse, by arrogant lunges. It is Russia that plays the key  part in recognizing our independence. And we are now seeking  ways to stabilize the situation at Caucasus-wide, regional level  -- which in turn will ease the lot of the Chechen Republic. In  order for this to occur it is primarily necessary to secure  unequivocal rejection of strong-arm pressure on Chechnya.  Dudayev is doing everything to cause bloodshed in the republic  -- either by provoking civil war or by causing Chechnya to fall  out with Russia. You get the impression that Chechnya's present  rulers do not understand what they are doing or what kind of  violence they are perpetrating against the people. Yet Dudayev  is still saying: "I have the support of 80 percent of the  population." He could cite a figure of 99 percent just as  successfully. It costs him nothing and commits him to nothing.  [Mamodayev ends]    From the life of the Chechen republic:    Eight people died and several were wounded in an exchange of  fire between two groups in the center of the Chechen capital.  The reason for the "shoot-out" was a long-standing financial  dispute: One side owed the other a large sum of money. A third  force -- a group run by one Labazanov, the local "authority" --  ended up embroiled in the conflict. Of late it has acted as  arbiter in such contentious situations. Labazanov turned up  with an armed crew of around 20 people. The "home team" lost  four men, the attackers lost two. Labazanov himself was  wounded. Immediately after the clash his comrades in arms  brought him to the hospital in an ambulance where, after  "releasing" all the other patients, they posted a strong guard  throughout the premises, including men with machine guns on the  roof.    Their fears were unfounded. Labazanov is a well-known figure  in Chechnya. His popularity in some circles is rivaled only by  the president's. Moreover they are worthy of one another. A  former sportsman and boxing master of sport, from the start of  the Chechen revolution Labazanov found himself on the  barricades. His subsequent activity is shrouded in mystery.  Although on paper he and his team rank as presidential  structures.    According to reports from Groznyy, there is total confusion  among the leaders of the republic's relatively sound farms. The  reason being not the economy but crime. A crime wave has swept  through rural areas of Chechnya, with agricultural producers  being shot and blackmailed and their enterprises being robbed.  Gangs masked in camouflage gear "national guard-style" are  rifling through cattle pens, farms, and grain stores. Country  people are having to organize self-defense detachments.  Sheltering behind national interests, clan thugs are living  with the threat of reprisals from non-Chechen leaders. And  their recalcitrant patrons are "punished according to the law of  the mountains." Thus one night "Sarysuyskiy" Sovkhoz Director  Yanali Deniyev was killed with an assault rifle, "Rossiya"  Kolkhoz Chairman Iosif Nisanov was shot with a machinegun, and  Boris Yerik, chairman of the "Terek" Joint-Stock Company," was  carted off somewhere from a team meeting.    Meanwhile Dudayev is once again shuffling the leaders of the  power structures: He has sacked the general prosecutor and  replaced the internal affairs minister, the head of the criminal  police department, the chairman of the Supreme Court....    While policemen chase old ladies through bazaars to combat  speculation, the state security service is "watching over"  "enemies of the Chechen people" in the opposition; criminal  proceedings are being instituted against the boss fighting  organized crime, whom the regime considers undesirable. The  unknown troublemaker who fired a grenade thrower at the  presidential palace was evidently the parting shot here.</p>

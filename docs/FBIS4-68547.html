			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Vengerov, chairman of the Judicial </F> Board on Informational Disputes, conducted by OBSHCHAYA GAZETA  correspondent: "Power of the Mass Media"]    [Text] Anatoliy VENGEROV, chairman of the Judicial  Board on Informational Disputes, believes: The informational  space of Russia is ever more becoming a battlefield, on which  the main problems of its future are decided.    In December of 1993, 65-year old professor of law and  head of the state and law department at Moscow State Juridical  Academy, Anatoliy Borisovich Vengerov, became the chairman of  Russia's newly created Judicial Board on Informational Disputes.  It was organized in accordance with the presidential edict on  the basis of the Arbitration Informational Court. Today the  Judicial Board has seven members, three of which are journalists  and four--jurists.    [Correspondent] What real achievements has the Judicial  Board  had time to accomplish for society and for the mass media?    [Vengerov] In this time, we have issued 11 rulings, all on  controversial and very complex problems of current times,  associated with major inter-ethnic conflicts, with the  recognition of the reliability and objectivity of facts  published in the press, and with the most acute political  disputes in society. We have also made two announcements. The  first--on the newspaper ZAVTRA in connection with the  publication by Iona Andronova, "The Secrets of the Kremlin,"  which consisted of vicious lies directed toward the  destabilization of the situation in the country. The second was  in regard to your publication, in connection with the situation  surrounding "Version No 1." At the same time, we have issued  rulings on 50 other various requests and applications. We also  had to look into the question of who issues licenses for  television broadcasting today and how. The journalists from  Arkhangelsk Oblast asked about this, as they were unable to find  such an agency in the country. It turned out that there really  is no such agency today, and this is a violation of the law. We  also received inquiries from Vladivostok, where a journalist was  insulted, being refused the right to participate in press  conferences. We reviewed the acute situations surrounding the  mass media in Orel, Voronezh, Derbent, and Kemerovo. In  Kemerovo, on the contrary, the local press went beyond the  framework of what was morally acceptable in its publications,  and we forced it to write a retraction of its repeated insults  addressed at the local administration. Although it is true,  instead of a retraction, it poured forth new insults... In  short, we are not sitting idle.    I would like to stress that most of the cases which we have  reviewed concern not capital, but regional publications. Most  often it is there that informational disputes arise, and as yet  we cannot provide a sufficiently effective mechanism of  influence by the Judicial Board, which is located in Moscow, on  local disputes. It seems we must create regional judicial boards  modelled after our own, for the rapid review of regional  informational disputes.    [Correspondent] Does it not seem to you that, even without a  further increase in judicial boards similar to your own, we  already have very many different organizations which are  supposedly engaged in protecting free speech?    [Vengerov] Without a doubt, the Russian informational space  is simply overloaded with them, and free speech itself may  perish in the embrace of such defenders. Just look: There is a  state inspection on protecting freedom of the press and the mass  media under the Roskompechat [RF Committee on the Press], and  the Roskompechat itself, and our Judicial Board, and the  Administration for Informational Provision under the president,  and the Committee on Informational Policy and Communications of  the State Duma, and the Federal Service on Television and Radio  Broadcasting. Here we must add also the numerous social  organizations--the Union of Journalists, the Committee for  Protection of the Rights of Journalists, and so on and so  forth...    [Correspondent] Evidently, this is not an elemental process,  when everyone wants to defend glasnost a little bit? It is not a  random occurence?    [Vengerov] Of course, it is a regularity--a direct  reflection  of that state of society when the informational space, along  with the legal, is ever more becoming the object of very  specific skirmishes. I am convinced that the mass media today in  Russia is a real and very strong power, a social field on which,  perhaps, the very main things in the future of the country are  being decided. And very many see this informational field as  such--as a field where they must conquer. This explains the  emergence of the large number of structures about which we  speak. They are really waging a struggle for this field, for  influence in the mass media, which is not only an instrument for  ensuring power. It can create power, but it can also kill it.  Newspapers today have the power to give birth to politicians,  and to cast them down.    [Correspondent] It seems to me that you are somewhat  exaggerating. Such a fateful role is sooner within the power of  present-day television. As a rule, the real practicing  journalist today gets the opposite impression, that he is being  stubbornly ignored both by the authorities and by the people.    [Vengerov] No, I know what I am talking about. Television  today is merely one of the channels of influence by the fourth  power, perhaps the quickest and most widespread. However,  sociological studies, including those conducted at our request,  show that in the regions, of which Russia consists for the most  part, it is the press organs which have the greatest influence.    [Correspondent] It is interesting, how do we, the Russian  journalists, appear in your eyes today? What are we lacking?  What do we have in excess?    [Vengerov] A certain portion of the journalists, and alas a  considerable one, appear in my eyes to be totally irresponsible  people. By irresponsibility I mean primarily a low ethical and  political culture. However, I would like to emphasize that this  is specifically my perception, and not reality, since any  prosecuting or judicial workers most often see the negative side  of life. In most of the cases which the Judicial Board reviews,  there is a constant discussion of style and form of presentation  of material. For example, recently we issued a ruling on the  EKSPRESS-GAZETA which is published in Moscow, and whose founder  is the newspaper KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA (which receives state  subsidies, and this is important in this situation), along with  the publishing group SEGODNYA.    EKSPRESS-GAZETA regularly publishes materials of an entirely  inadmissable tone. One may read headlines such as, "Shokhin is  Not an Onanist," or a narrative by a former journalist who has  recalled a story told to him by Mikhail Poltoranin. One may have  varying attitudes toward the latter. One may love him or hate  him, but it is entirely inadmissable to publish material talking  about how, when he was a young lad, Misha Poltoranin entertained  himself with young friends such as himself in his native Altay  by casting heavy stones across a raging river, and using the  main object of manly pride as a sling shot. Despite the fact  that the "Temporary Statute on Provision of Activity of State  Duma Deputies" has been publicized, EXPRESS-GAZETA publishes an  article where everything is garbled through and through, and  where there is a real mockery of the deputy corps.    We received an appeal from the Duma apparatus in regard to  this publication, and rightly so--they have to defend  themselves. Actually, when we studied the newspaper and the  given material, we came to the conclusion that its activity  surpasses all possible bounds of immorality. The lawyers  defending the interests of the publication at our judicial  session stated that the newspaper is young and such a  presentation of material is a means of struggle for its place on  the newspaper market, a method and style of conquering its  competitors. Excuse me, but in our opinion this is simply filth.  As a result, last week we adopted a decision which is  unprecedented even for us: To ask the founder to dismiss the  editor-in-chief, Aleksandr Kupriyanov, from his position.    [Correspondent] And what if they do not listen to you, leave  Kupriyanov in his place and after some time renew the  publication of similar texts?    [Vengerov] We have the right to present the question of  issuing a warning for cessation of publication. I want to direct  your attention to the fact that the cases with which we deal, as  a rule, cannot be handled by ordinary judicial institutions.  Well, can an ordinary court decide, for example, the problem of  distributing television time between various parties during the  period of the pre-electoral campaign? There is no way that it  can. This is not within its competency. Can an ordinary court  protect the interests of children against the vulgar attacks  which, for example, the newspaper NOVYY VZGLYAD allows itself by  publishing sadistic, masochistic and perverse materials? It  cannot. It is within its powers to exact moral damages if  someone specific has been wronged, to decide a case in someone's  specific favor. My idea comes down to the fact that in the new  pluralistic informational space, unique state arbitration  agencies must emerge, which safeguard the moral interests of  society above all. Such is our Judicial Board.    [Correspondent] And is it in your power, for instance, to  deprive a journal of operation?    [Vengerov] Without a doubt, especially if the dispute  surrounding its name is associated with state agencies. We have  the right to pose the question of rebuke, or of reprimand, or of  dismissal of a journalist. Recently we reviewed a very painful  case, when a journalist ascribed her ideas and her own words to  other persons. We are speaking of a series of publications in  IZVESTIYA by Irina Dementyeva regarding the Osetin-Ingush  conflict--"War and Peace in Prigorodnyy Rayon." We determined  that Dementyeva had ascribed her own, in this case incorrect,  judgments to the representatives of the organs of state power,  and thereby distorted the real picture, thus evoking additional  tension in an already grave conflict. Let us put it this way, we  only scolded Dementyeva, but we could have posed the question of  her punishment.    [Correspondent] How actively do the Judicial Board's  decisions get involved in politics?    [Vengerov] Yes, we do get involved in politics, except not  from a political standpoint, but rather from an ethical one. For  example, we dealt with the situation in Nizhniy Novgorod in  connection with the elections for mayor which were announced  there. Governor Nemtsov himself wrote in the decree on elections  that the state agencies cannot speak out on the side of one  candidate or another, but then he himself began telling in the  mass media about how he could simply have appointed anyone he  saw fit as mayor. Without hesitating, we immediately said that  Mr. Nemtsov was wrong. We quickly sent our decision by fax to  Nizhniy Novgorod--to the editorial offices of the newspapers, to  the mayor's office, and the elections were not held.    [Correspondent] Have you personally ever engaged in any  political activity?    [Vengerov] Due to the nature of my character, I cannot  participate in politics.    [Correspondent] What newspapers do you prefer to read?    [Vengerov] I subscribe to very many of them. I try to read  the press which reflects different positions and different  points of view.    [Correspondent] Do you have any favorite newspaper authors?    [Vengerov] Yes, I like to read Stanislav Kondrashov in  IZVESTIYA. I do not like to see moans and groans of complaint in  the newspapers. I prefer a thoughtful analytical style in which  the author does not impose his ideas upon the reader, but rather  invites him to participate in his reflections.</p>

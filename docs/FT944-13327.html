			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Bosnian army drives out Serbs The Bosnian Moslem army has pushed back Bosnian Serb forces in a major offensive in north-west Bosnia, forcing retreating Serb soldiers to abandon tanks and mortars. The UN said Bosnian army had attacked out of the Bihac pocket, capturing between 100 and 150 square kilometres. 'They have caught the BSA (Bosnian Serb army) unawares and . . . (the Serbs') normally effective command and control structure collapsed and they withdrew in considerable disarray, abandoning equipment such as tanks and mortars,' said military spokesman Colonel Tim Spicer. Bosnian army fifth corps soldiers were celebrating in the streets of Bihac town while aid agencies reported several thousand refugees, apparently Serbs, fleeing the fighting. However, UN military officers in Sarajevo said the Moslem offensive had slowed and they believed they had paused to consolidate their gains. The Bihac pocket has been surrounded by Serb forces for much of Bosnia's 30 months of war. But since it suppressed a revolt by breakaway Moslems in the summer, the Moslem Fifth Corps has turned its attention to the Serbs. 'Our assessment is that the BSA is somewhat stretched at the moment,' Col Spicer said.</p>

			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Observer: Dr Who? Interesting to see whether the halo of Dr Gwyn Jones, the soon to depart chairman of the Welsh Development Agency, survives in tact after today's grilling by the Commons Public Accounts Committee. The 44-year-old Jones, one of the young thrusters of Welsh business, has done a good job raising the profile of the WDA and attracting lots of well known foreign companies to invest in the valleys. But the National Audit Office, the independent official watchdog, has taken his agency to task for the size of its golden handshakes - roughly a quarter of the staff have been made redundant over the last three years  - and its policy of free petrol for WDA bosses. The irregularities were not big enough to cause the WDA's accounts to be qualified, but they have pricked the interest of the PAC. For a man occasionally mentioned as a future boss of the Confederation of British Industry or even chairman of the BBC, Jones needs to prove to the PAC that he is just as much at home with the fine print as he is with the big picture.</p>

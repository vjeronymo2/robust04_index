			<p>Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the National Integration Movement, </F> MINA, and Popular Alliance; place and date not given]    [Text] The Popular Alliance and MINA [National Integration  Movement] political parties have been subject to what is  obviously a discriminatory measure by the Electoral Tribunal  magistrates.    The Electoral Tribunal magistrates' decision is intended to  deprive our organizations of the right to participate in the  upcoming elections and thus put us in a disadvantageous position  compared to other political groups.    Being the active organizations we are and based on our legal  status as political parties involved in their organization  process, instead of refraining from action, we are issuing an  appeal to all our supporters, urging them to double their  efforts, defend our principles, and actively participate in the  presidential campaign of Professor Ruben Carles and his slate,  to which we offer our total support. We will thus support the  Panamanian people's hope for a true change.    (signed) Dr. Arrigo Guardia    (signed) Professor Noris de Correa</p>

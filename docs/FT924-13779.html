			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Egypt hunts for survivors THE DEATH toll in the Cairo earthquake rose yesterday to an estimated 450 people, with some 4,000 injured. Casualty figures may range higher as the search for survivors continues in collapsed buildings, many of them crumbling tenements, in poorer areas of the city of 12m. It has been one of Egypt's worst national disasters and prompted President Hosni Mubarak to cut short a state visit to China. Among the worst tragedies was the collapse of a 14-storey building in the comfortable middle-class suburb of Heliopolis. Early yesterday, rescue teams were still scrabbling through the debris with little hope of finding anyone alive as tearful relatives looked on in stunned disbelief. In the poorer areas of the city hundreds of flimsy, jerry-built structures were made uninhabitable. According to official figures, more than 100 buildings collapsed or were partly damaged, but this almost certainly underestimates the extent of the destruction in a city where lax building codes are the rule rather than the exception. At Cairo's main Kasr el-Eini hospital, Dr Khayri al Samra, the superintendent, said many injuries were caused by panic. People had suffered fractures after jumping from swaying buildings or had been trampled underfoot in the mad rush to escape wildly-shaking tenements. Others were trapped in alleyways. Fearing a second quake, thousands of people spent the warm night outdoors, some driving into the desert and others taking refuge in the open areas of private clubs.</p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> U.S. INDICTS TAHOE MAYOR  </P> <P> A federal grand jury indicted South Lake Tahoe Mayor Terry Trupp and four other  men on cocaine, money-laundering and currency violations growing out of a sting  operation dubbed Deep Snow. Trupp, 46, was denied bail after his arrest June 11  and is in jail awaiting arraignment July 5 before a federal magistrate. His  wife, Kimberly, 24, who was freed on $100,000 bail, was not named in the two  indictments. Trump is accused of conspiring to possess with intent to  distribute 100 kilograms of cocaine and of money-laundering. During Trupp's  detention hearing earlier this month, Assistant U.S. Atty. Tom Flynn produced  transcripts of recorded conversations between Trupp and undercover agents in  which Trupp was quoted as saying he had overseas bank accounts and hoped to  move soon to New Zealand to join a brother who emigrated there.  </P></p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Barclays fails in MCC appeal BARCLAYS Bank announced yesterday that it had failed in the Court of Appeal to reverse a High Court ruling that it must face proceedings in the New York Bankruptcy Court over a disputed Dollars 30m it received from Maxwell Communication Corporation. The bank obtained the money just before MCC went into administration. In July, Mr Justice Hoffmann struck out an application by Barclays Bank for injunctions to prevent Price Waterhouse, MCC's administrators, from bringing proceedings in the US courts for the return of the money. Yesterday, Lords Justices Glidewell, Mann and Leggatt dismissed Barclays' appeal against Mr Justice Hoffmann's decision. He also refused the bank leave to appeal to the House of Lords. Barclays, a creditor of MCC, received the Dollars 30m repayment on MCC's overdraft at its branch in Holborn, London, in November last year. Shortly after the move, the company went into UK administration and applied for equivalent Chapter 11 protection in New York. The bank believes it could resist the claim against it under English law, while it stands less chance in the US court. Barclays argued that the English courts were the correct forum for the dispute and it sought to bar the administrators from invoking US jurisdiction.</p>

Speaking at a joint press conference with Trade Minister Wu  Yi in the Chinese capital during the 13th meeting of the EU  [European Union]-China trade committee, Brittan warned China  that "any discriminatory diplomatic action versus one of the  member countries would be considered a serious question" for the  community.    (Talks between China and Britain over the transfer of Hong  Kong from British to Chinese sovereignty broke down in December,  when Hong Kong governor Chris Patten presented electoral reforms  to the legislature despite the opposition of the Chinese  government.    China believes the government is trying to change the  colony's political composition, strengthening pro-British,  anti-China forces to "transform Hong Kong into an independent or  semi-dependent political entity that will not be controllable by  Beijing," the news agency New China said recently.    Hong Kong is scheduled to pass to China in 1997, and the  mainland government has warned it will not tolerate reforms  being made now by a "lame duck" government they say will make  the country "ungovernable" when it comes time for them to take  it over.    The Chinese were further angered when the British government  published accounts of the 17 sessions in the talks between  Beijing and London on Hong Kong's future.)    Brittan spoke today after Ms. Wu Yi, in response to a  question, called Great Britain's approach to the Hong Kong  question "not very friendly and not very cooperative," and added  that their problems "could not help but affect bilateral trade  and economic relations."    The sharp exchange came after initial declarations of mutual  satisfaction with today's committee meeting, in an atmosphere  described as "friendly and pragmatic" that led to "excellent"  results.    Ms. Wu Yi said "consensus" had been reached on many  outstanding questions between China and Europe, and that mutual  efforts were being made to resolve others.    EU-China trade volume reached 26.1 billion dollars last  year,  a 50 percent increase over 1992, Wu Yi said. China's exports  equaled 11.7 billion dollars and imports totaled 14.4 billion  dollars, a 49 percent increase over 1992. "The European Union  is China's major exporter after Japan," said Wu Yi.    According to EU statistics, which include indirect  commercial  exchange, the total trade volume amounted to 31 billion dollars,  with an 8 billion deficit for the EU.    Brittan expressed admiration for China's "notable" progress  in making economic reforms, underlining the fact that the EU  supports China's claim to join the GATT roundtable "in the  interest not only of China but of the entire world." The EU  trade commissioner's visit to China ends Tuesday [1 March].</p>

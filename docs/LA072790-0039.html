			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> A SERENADE OF CLASSICS FROM PIANIST, BASSIST  </P> <P> Grace, empathy and an abundance of jazz feeling have long been the hallmarks of  the felicitous collaboration of pianist Alan Broadbent and bassist Putter  Smith. Armed with these assets and few more for good measure, the pair  serenaded a small but mostly attentive audience Tuesday in the lounge of  Lunaria, a new Westside bistro that spotlights jazz and, occasionally,  Brazilian music.  </P> <P> Broadbent and Smith delivered classic tunes, from Benny Golson's "Along Came  Betty" to Clifford Brown's "Daahoud" and Billy Strayhorn's "Upper Manhattan  Medical Group," offering melody readings and improvisations as imaginative as  they were musical.  </P> <P> His eyes closed, his head slowly shaking from side to side, Broadbent sat at  the same Yamaha grand piano that was a fixture at the now-defunct Comeback Inn  in Venice and played with verve and elan. On "Betty," he ripped off lines that  could have been made of glowing pearls, so even and round was the shape of each  note. Later, he shifted to locked-hands chords that were full of light, as if a  stream of sunshine had entered a darkened room.  </P> <P> On Tadd Dameron's "If You Could See Me Now," the pianist was purposefully  pensive, his ideas sometimes stated with the apprehension of a cat walking  through wet grass. Still, quiet explosions occurred within each brief melodic  statement. The closing "Daahoud" crackled with an understated intensity.  </P> <P> Smith was his own man as well as Broadbent's partner. He hunched over his  instrument as he played, delivering lines that supported the pianist, yet were  never an intrusion. His solos were often composed of brief, telling remarks, as  on "Invitation," where his minimalist efforts left a lot of space while still  echoing the shape and substance of the song's melody.

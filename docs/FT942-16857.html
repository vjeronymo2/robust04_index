			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Italy's feuding victors meet Italy's Northern League and the neo-fascist National Alliance - members of the right-wing alliance which won last week's election - held a surprise meeting yesterday to discuss federalism, the principal issue which divides them. Senior League politicians said Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the federalist League, and Mr Gianfranco Fini, secretary of the National Alliance, had not talked about the post-election political crisis. Earlier this week, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, leader of Forza Italia, the third member of the victorious pact, suspended talks with his allies on forming a government after seven days of squabbling. He will wait for Italy's president to name a prime minister later this month before renewing negotiations. The League said yesterday's meeting was a positive step, if only because the National Alliance - which favours a more centralised state  - had agreed to discuss federalism. Mr Fini, however, said federalism was only acceptable as part of a presidential regime.</p>

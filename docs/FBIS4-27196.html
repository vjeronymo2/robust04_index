			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 28 KYODO -- The leader of the second  largest opposition party urged Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to  resign along with his cabinet or dissolve the House of  Representatives, signaling greater resolve among the opposition  camp to unseat the ruling coalition government.    Hata's minority government has no other options, said Social  Democratic Party (SDP) Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, speaking at  the beginning of a two-day session of the party's  decision-making Central Committee.    Hata can choose to either have his cabinet resign en masse  and establish a new coalition framework that includes the SDP,  or he can dissolve the lower house, hold a general election and  form a new government based on the voters' will, Murayama said.    The SDP must move to return to power, Murayama said, but  added it should not be understood that the party would  participate in the current Hata administration.    A draft action plan to be officially endorsed at the meeting  stresses that the Hata cabinet opt for resigning en masse and a  new coalition government be established.    But Murayama's remarks emphasized a greater resolve for the  holding of a general election.    Murayama said the SDP should gather together "social  democratic and liberal" forces centering on the party's  cooperation with New Party Sakigake [Harbinger], led by former  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura.    Murayama hinted he would be willing to cooperate with  elements of the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP), saying there are some LDP members who seek to protect the  war-renouncing constitution.    He also said the SDP should seek cooperation with two ruling  coalition parties -- Komeito and the Democratic Socialist Party  (DSP).    The SDP was the largest force in the coalition government  until it bolted the alliance last month after a new Diet bloc  was created by the coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party], former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's Japan  New Party and the DSP.    The SDP's departure left Hata with Japan's first minority  government in four decades.</p>

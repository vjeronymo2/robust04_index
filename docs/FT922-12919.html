			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / The Lex Column: RMC The building materials sector offers a striking contrast between the adventurism of Redland, recent victor in its battle for Steetley, and the consistently cautious RMC Group. The latter has been a model of how to fund a business without recourse to shareholders. Judging by the noises accompanying yesterday's 23 per cent fall in 1991 pre-tax profits this is not about to change. The key to the shares will be the UK, which contributed only 17 per cent of last year's operating profits against well over half in 1989. The bad news is that the company sees little sign of a UK upturn. The good news is that its determination to widen margins in the absence of volume increases deserves to be taken seriously.</p>

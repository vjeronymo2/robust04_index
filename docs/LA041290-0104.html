			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PARTYING ARTISTS PUT ON 'PROBATION' BY LAGUNA FESTIVAL  </P> <P> On the closing day of the Festival of Arts last summer, artist Jorg Dubin  flipped on "Jailhouse Rock," lit the charcoal near his booth and held an "Elvis  Presley Memorial Barbecue."  </P> <P> Dubin had removed most of his artwork from the booth except the centerpiece: an  Elvis Presley shrine, complete with candles, an offerings plate and a kneeling  pad.  </P> <P> But the artist's "tongue in cheek" activities that day landed him in trouble  with the festival's board of directors. In January, Dubin said, the board asked  him to not participate in this summer's show, saying he broke the rules by  partying on the grounds and by removing his artworks before the festival  concluded.  </P> <P> Then the board rescinded that decision and placed Dubin on probation for three  years. Five other artists who attended the Elvis party received probation  periods of one year.  </P> <P> Dubin believes the board's action was intended to discourage displays such as  the Elvis shrine.  </P> <P> "I just feel the festival isn't a place that wants that kind of artwork," Dubin  said. "They want things that don't create controversy."  </P> <P> So Dubin and the other five artists, who have been dubbed the "Festival Six,"  have hired a lawyer to represent them in further discussions with the board.  </P> <P> "I felt they had totally overreacted," Dubin said of the board. "Some people  took (the final day's events) kind of seriously."  </P> <P> The festival board is declining comment on the situation, spokeswoman Sally  Reeve said. But one board member, who emphasized that he was not speaking for  the board, said the probation was imposed because of the artists' behavior, not  the artworks.  </P> <P> "We don't make judgments on the art that appears in the festival," board member  David Young said. "I think they built a molehill into a mountain, that's all."  </P> <P> Jeff LeFevre, one of the five artists placed on probation, remains puzzled  about the entire situation.  </P> <P> "We were just six out of about 50 to 70 other people" celebrating that day,  LeFevre said. "My theory was, we were the first six there at the beginning of  the day. . . . It's really quite a mystery."  </P> <P> Attorney Eva-Marie Boyd was hired by Dubin, LeFevre and artists Randy Bader,  Chris Hoy, Scott Moore and David Sabaroff.  </P> <P> Dubin said he will sit out this summer's festival. Boyd said the artists want  their probation lifted or want a more specific explanation of what it means to  be on probation. Letters to the artists cited "flagrant violation of ground  rules" including having alcohol and a radio at the booth as the reason for  probation, she said, but the conditions of probation were not specified.  </P> <P> "They were hoping for a more egalitarian approach," Boyd said of the artists.  </P> <P> Young said that if the artists want to know what probation means, they should  "go look it up in the dictionary."  </P> <P> "It means they are going to be watched fairly carefully so that it doesn't  happen again," Young said.  </P></p>

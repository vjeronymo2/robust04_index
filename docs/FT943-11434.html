			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Vietnam wakes up with a thirst: Brewers are competing fiercely in a new market At street-side bars throughout Vietnam, a battle is under way for the loyalty of beer drinkers. For the first time in many years, the country is experiencing a fully fledged marketing battle. For many people there is still no choice. In many towns and cities, a small local factory produces draught beer which it sells in barrels straight to the bars. Increasingly, though, new canned and bottled beers are also on sale in bars and shops and the manufacturers are spending heavily to promote their products. One recent arrival which has grabbed its corner of the market is Tiger beer from Singapore. It has been marketed as the drink of the newly rich. 'I think if you are a businessman in Vietnam today, you will drink Tiger Beer,' says a young Vietnamese executive. 'That's the reason why the Vietnam Brewery which makes Tiger beer has been so successful.' Tiger caused a stir when its advertisements featuring a blonde woman first appeared. When the local authorities issued new rules banning the use of foreigners in advertising, it was rumoured to be a response to the Tiger adverts. The beer is now brewed in the southern commercial capital, Ho Chi Minh City, by a joint venture between the Dutch brewer Heineken, Singapore-based Fraser and Neave and a local partner. It was the first such venture to produce an imported beer locally and has captured a large share of the business market. However, it is expensive and at a dollar a bottle, most local people still cannot afford to buy it. Cheaper, and more popular among ordinary people, is Saigon beer, brewed by the Saigon Brewery. Saigon Brewery, like many of its local competitors, is in the middle of a big expansion programme. At the moment the average consumption of beer is less than four litres a year. Across the world the average is nearly four times that and in other South-East Asian countries such as the Philippines it is much higher. Local and foreign manufacturers believe this market still has a long way to grow. The limit now is the capacity of breweries. At the moment, the national capacity is less than 300m litres a year. But everyone seems to be expanding. When current growth targets are fulfilled, towards the end of this decade, total output will be about 500m litres a year. Industry bosses say that still will not be enough to satisfy this thirsty market. Another brewery that is expanding is Halida in Hanoi, which produces its own brand and has a joint venture agreement to make the Danish beer, Carlsberg. The brewery is in the middle of a development which will see capacity increase from 25m litres this year to more than 100m by the end of the decade. The company that now makes Halida is one of the big success stories of Vietnam's transition to a market economy. For many years, the company produced fish paste for export to eastern Europe. But with the collapse of the communist bloc, that market dried up and general manager Nguyen Thi Anh Nhan started looking for a new outlet. Abandoning fish paste, she managed to borrow Dollars 3m to set up a simple beer production line. That was in 1990. Now, the company is in the midst of a massive expansion project. Mrs Nhan says the outlook for the market is rosy: 'It's now summer and if you go to a bar after about two o'clock in the afternoon, they stop serving because they have run out of beer.'</p>

			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Dehaene urges EU stance on problems A strong, common European approach is the only way to tackle the EU's problems of unemployment, lack of industrial competitiveness and sluggish growth, the Belgian prime minister said yesterday. Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, who will chair Friday's summit of EU leaders in Brussels, warned member states against calling into question the value of such an approach at the time when it was most needed. 'We have built up Europe, we have agreed the Maastricht treaty, and we are part of a European Union: that's what we now have to use to face up to these common problems,' he said on Belgian television. Belgium, which holds the EU presidency, is likely to press for a co-ordinated approach to the economic crisis, citing as an example its own strict austerity plan. 'When there's a crisis, there's always a temptation to resolve the crisis by a form of protectionism. . . There's always a sort of 'me first' reflex. That's the wrong approach: when we're all in the same situation we will only get out of it together,' said Mr Dehaene yesterday. Be prepared, Page 12</p>

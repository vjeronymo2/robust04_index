			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Rumours work all year round in Brussels If there is one thing continental Europeans can teach their British colleagues, it is the importance of les grandes vacances. On August 1 somebody pulls a plug in Europe's administrative centre. Overnight Brussels empties; the concept of staggered holidays scathingly dismissed by officials, restaurants, lobbyists and translators. Even the tramp who plays an electric organ outside the city's main metro station has taken his leave for the month. All that are left are a duty press officer, a duty commissioner, and a few hard-working officials - mainly from the competition directorate who have to be here when merger cases are notified. 'It's as if there is a big party somewhere else to which I have not been invited,' said a senior competition official yesterday. This time, though, some of the hard core left behind believe colleagues settling down on Mediterranean beaches to read the latest Brussels-based thriller - Cartel, by Derek Fee - may be missing the action. With a new president - Mr Jacques Santer, the Luxembourg prime minister - due to take office in four months, and a whole new set of commissioners and chefs de cabinet yet to be appointed, the somewhat empty corridors are alive with rumor and speculation. 'Everyone is asking who Santer will appoint, how he will organise the portfolios, and what consequences this might have for the allocation of services,' said one senior official. 'People are thinking about how they will respond over the next two to three months which is when the rumours will really take off.' 'A great rumour doing the rounds at the moment is that the UK will pay a heavy price for using their veto (of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian leader) at Corfu,' said another observer. 'The question is how big a price?' Still smarting from seeing Mr Dehaene vetoed by the UK, the French are rumoured to be angling to secure the external economic relations portfolio from Sir Leon Brittan. Even more mischievous is a rumour that those governments still sulking over the UK veto will work hard to see that Mr Neil Kinnock, former UK Labour party leader and newly appointed commissioner, is awarded the social affairs portfolio. With his declaration to end the UK's opt-out of the social chapter, such an appointment could cause havoc at home. Next is the question of who will staff the office of Mr Santer. It has already been confirmed that Mr Jim Cloos, currently chef de cabinet for Mr Rene Steichen, the Luxembourg commissioner, will become Mr Santer's chef, and beyond that the gossip centres on how many more Luxembourgers he will be able to fill his posts with. Most, cruelly, suggest three as the total. Meanwhile, officials are reflecting on the European parliament's display of muscle last month, over the allegedly under-hand appointment of the new Commission president. The parliament has said it would like to vet all commissioners individually before Mr Santer takes over next year, a prospect which is prompting a mixture of mirth and nervousness among the top echelons still languishing in Brussels.</p>

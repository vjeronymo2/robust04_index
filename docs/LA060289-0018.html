			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HAWTHORNE SEEKS 7TH STATE TRACK TITLE;  </P> <P> BOYS EXPECTED TO DOMINATE; GIRLS GIVEN A LONG-SHOT CHANCE  </P> <P> After a grueling schedule that included 13 regular-season and five post-season  meets, all of the cards are on the table for the Hawthorne High track and field  team.  </P> <P> The Cougars, who have dominated state competition for six consecutive seasons,  will try for their seventh state title beginning tonight and continuing  tomorrow in the CIF State Championships at Cerritos College.  </P> <P> Today's preliminaries begin at 3 p.m., with the finals scheduled for Saturday  at 5 p.m.  </P> <P> The Hawthorne boys' team, consisting of Chris Alexander, Anthony Smith, Erik  Allen and Curtis Conway, will try for its third consecutive state title and  sixth in the last seven years. The girls, meanwhile, will try to capture their  second title in the last four years, although they are considered a long shot.  </P> <P> Will the Cougars' domination continue in 1989?  </P> <P> "We hope so," said Hawthorne Coach Kye Courtney. He said the boys' team's  chances are as good as ever. "We've had good practice sessions this week and  we're stronger now than we've ever been. We've usually only counted on four  events, but now we're six events strong."  </P> <P> The 400-meter relay team, which set a state record in each of the last two  meets, will try to break the national record of 40.18 held by South Oak Cliff  High School of Dallas.  </P> <P> The Cougars broke the state record at the CIF divisional finals with a time of  40.36, then broke that mark last week at the Masters Meet in 40.25.  </P> <P> But Courtney said the team would have broken the 40-second barrier at the  Masters meet had it not been for a technical mistake by Conway, who ran the  anchor leg. Conway, after receiving the handoff from Allen, switched the baton  from one hand to the other before starting the final leg.  </P> <P> "He's only done it during the actual race," said Courtney. "I think he'll get  over it. He's determined now. He knows he blew it. When he knows he made a  mistake, he really gets going."  </P> <P> Courtney said the only serious competition for the 400 relay team may come from  Oakland and Tulare.  </P> <P> "Tulare looks good, Oakland looks good," he said, "but it's hard to find  anybody else. I think we have a little too much."  </P> <P> Oakland's qualifying time was 41.31, while Tulare posted a mark of 41.61.  </P> <P> The Cougars' 1,600-meter relay team also had the fastest qualifying time in the  state, with a mark of 3:13.05. Hawthorne will also rely on Conway in the 100  and 200 races. He had the fastest qualifying times in the state in both events  at the Masters Meet.  </P> <P> Alexander and Allen also qualified in the 100, while Allen will double in the  200. Keith Pouncey will represent the Cougars in the 110 high hurdles, while  Smith will compete in the long jump.  </P> <P> On the girls' side, the Cougars will rely on Kesha Marvin in the 400 and Rhonda  Kennerson in the 800. Hawthorne's 400- and 1,600-meter relay teams also  qualified.  </P> <P> Other area qualifiers include Bishop Montgomery's Pete Hargraves in the 100.  Hargraves became the Knights' first state qualifier since Mike Gonzales in the  early 1980s.  </P> <P> Tim Camillo of Leuzinger and Greg Wiler of Rolling Hills will compete in the  pole vault.  </P> <P> Local girls' qualifiers include Kerrie Pegues of St. Bernard in the 400 and  1,600 relay teams, Marilyn Cragin of Miraleste in the high jump, Lisa Leslie of  Morningside in the long and triple jump, and Shareena Harris of Morningside in  the triple jump.  </P> <P> Leslie, despite qualifying in both of her events, will not compete in the state  meet because of tryouts for the U.S. junior national basketball team in  Colorado Springs.  </P> <P> Boys' qualifiers from the L.A. City Section include Larry Billoups of Carson in  the 400, Chris Manley of Banning in the 800, Curtis Hawkins and Carlos Celosia  of Carson in the 110 high hurdles, Chris Roulier and Celosia of Carson in the  300 intermediate hurdles, the Carson 400 and 1,600 relay teams, Bob Whitfield  and Morris Unutoa of Banning in the shot put, John Anthony of Carson and  Charles Mabry of Gardena in the high jump, Roulier of Carson in the long jump,  and Chris Morris of Banning in the triple jump.  </P> <P> Area girls' qualifiers from the City Section are Noelle Ragland of Carson in  the 200, Lucrecia Mendoza of Banning in the 1,600, Mendoza of Banning in the  3,200, Tasha Turner of Narbonne in the 100 hurdles, the San Pedro 400 relay  team, the Banning 1,600 relay team, Alysiah Bond of San Pedro in the long jump,  and Mary Esene of Narbonne in the shot put.  </P></p>

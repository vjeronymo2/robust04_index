			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems agree to differ on referendum LIBERAL DEMOCRAT MPs are to decide individually whether to support a referendum on Maastricht when the amendment comes before the Commons. The arrangement is a tacit admission that they have had to agree to differ. The acceptance of a free vote on a referendum reflects differences of view in the party over aspects of their tactics on Maastricht. There were, for example, various opinions about what line the party should have taken if, instead of continuing to oppose the Labour amendment which caused Monday's humiliating government defeat, ministers had said that they accepted its principle and would alter the bill when it reached the House of Lords. Tactics will be discussed again today at the weekly meeting of the 20 MPs. The party is unmoved by Tory accusations of 'hypocrisy' in its support for the Labour amendment on Monday, and points out the delays in the bill that are attributable to the government. While Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, has called for a referendum on Maastricht, it was noticeably absent from the party conference motion on Europe last autumn. Government whips know that Liberal Democrat support is vital on procedural motions, and have been in constant touch with the party since January, when the extensive Commons discussions on the legislation really got under way. The Liberal Democrats have often voted with the government on motions to close debate, because they want to make progress with the bill, and to underline their 'pro-European' credentials. This also underlay their critical support for the Tories in the 'paving' debate on Maastricht last autumn, when the government had a majority of just three votes. Little incentive has been offered to support the Tories on issues of substance where the government risks defeat. The Liberal Democrat commitment to proportional representation - to which the government is strongly opposed  -means that ministers cannot move far enough to satisfy them. While the party has still to take final decisions on its attitude towards the amendments on economic and monetary union which could unite Labour and the Euro-sceptics, it is already so firmly committed to the social chapter that the government has no real chance of detaching the Liberal Democrat MPs from its other opponents on these amendments.</p>

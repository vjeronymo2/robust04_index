			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Experts give some unusually outspoken advice It is unclear whether it is the effect of global economic recovery or the heady sensation of celebrating its 50th birthday: but the latest World Economic Outlook from the IMF is more straightforward in the policy advice it gives its members than previous issues. It is particularly outspoken about the need for the US to raise interest rates further. Early in its report, it declares that 'further increases in policy-related (US) interest rates are needed. . . if overheating and a rise in inflation expectations are to be avoided'. The Fund later declares that 'virtually all indicators now suggest that little or no slack is left in output and labour markets' in the US. It writes: 'Given the current cyclical position, there is an increasing need to move US monetary policy to a neutral position consistent with potential growth of about 2.5 per cent a year by raising rates further.' Explaining this advice, Mr Michael Mussa, director of the IMF's research department, said yesterday the Fund was not advocating a sharp rise in US rates. But it thought more tightening would be needed over the next six, nine or 12 months. Central banks, such as the US Federal Reserve, needed to be leaders, not followers, in financial markets. The Outlook points out that, in spite of recent increases, both short- and long-term US interest rates remain low compared with the 1980s as a whole, and even with the mid-1980s. The Fund maintains that, in real terms, US short rates averaged 4.5 per cent and long rates 6 per cent in 1985-90, against 1.5 per cent and 4.25 per cent in mid-1994. The IMF also urges the US to take further steps to reduce its budget deficit to put its debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward trend. The Fund appears more satisfied with Japanese and German monetary policies. Although Mr Mussa said a small further drop in German rates was possible if the recovery slackened or inflation fell, the bottom for this business cycle had nearly been reached. The IMF warns Japan it will have to resume fiscal consolidation over the medium term, 'including a comprehensive social security and tax reform to forestall an unsustainable increase in public debt as the population ages'. Some of its toughest words are reserved for Italy, which yesterday put forward new budget plans. 'Credible efforts to put the unsustainably high debt ratio on a declining trend during the balance of the decade are essential for Italy's longer-term financial stability and growth prospects,' it says. The IMF envisages a jump to 5.5 per cent in three-months' US interest rates next year from 4.4 per cent this year, against a rise to 2.7 per cent from 1.9 per cent for yen rates. It expects the three months' D-Mark rate to slip slightly to 4.8 per cent from 5.2 per cent.</p>

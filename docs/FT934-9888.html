			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Nigeria increases fuel prices sharply Nigeria's interim government raised the price of domestic fuel yesterday from N0.70 (2p) per litre to N5 (15p) per litre of petrol, N4.75 for diesel and N4.50 for kerosene as part of a range of reforms aimed at securing debt relief from the international creditors, Paul Adams reports from Lagos. The move is likely to be resented by many people, who are suffering form high inflation and falling living standards. But government and private sector leaders say that it is necessary to cut out smuggling of fuel, reduce losses in the state oil company and attract investment in the downstream oil and gas sectors.</p>

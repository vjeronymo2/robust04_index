			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MCCAW LIFTS BID FOR LIN BROADCASTING;  </P> <P> MERGERS: CELLULAR GIANT KICKS IN ANOTHER $800 MILLION IN FIGHT WITH BELLSOUTH  FOR COMPANY.  </P> <P> McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. said today it is boosting by more than $800  million its bid for shares of LIN Broadcasting Corp., which has resisted its  advances by agreeing to merge with BellSouth Corp.  </P> <P> In its latest offer, McCaw, the country's largest cellular communications  company, said it is now seeking 22.5 million LIN shares at $150 each, up from  22 million at $125 each.  </P> <P> McCaw said the new offer hikes the value of the nation's No. 7 cellular company  to about $7.5 billion from its previous bid, which valued all of New York-based  LIN at about $6.7 billion.  </P> <P> LIN is coveted for its valuable cellular franchises in such lucrative markets  as Los Angeles, Dallas, New York and Philadelphia.  </P> <P> McCaw said that as soon as possible after completion of the offer, it would  cause LIN to buy $425 million of McCaw Class A common stock and distribute it  as a dividend in which non-McCaw shareholders would receive $16.17 of the stock  for each LIN share retained.  </P> <P> McCaw said it has pledged to pay 12% annual interest to tendering LIN  shareholders should its tender close after March 31.  </P> <P> Kirkland, Wash.-based McCaw said it requested an opportunity to respond to any  improved offer from BellSouth before LIN enters into any revision of its deal  with BellSouth.  </P> <P> McCaw now owns 5,089,500 LIN shares, and the shares it is offering to acquire  represent about 46% of the fully diluted LIN shares not already owned by McCaw.  </P> <P> A successful offer would give McCaw slightly over 50% of LIN on a fully diluted  basis, the company said.  </P> <P> McCaw said if BellSouth should respond to the new offer by sweetening its bid,  it would ask LIN to put both offers up for a vote at the Jan. 12 shareholders'  meeting called to consider the present BellSouth transaction and remove  defensive measures.  </P> <P> McCaw said if LIN were to agree to a vote on its offer and a removal of  defenses, McCaw would agree to extend its tender to the date of the meeting and  abide by the shareholder vote.  </P> <P> "In the absence of such action, we intend to take our case directly to the LIN  stockholders through a consent solicitation relating to the replacement of a  majority of the LIN board," McCaw said.  </P> <P> McCaw said its amended offer assumes that LIN will continue with its plan to  buy the 46% interest in New York City cellular telephone operations now held by  Metromedia Inc. for $1.9 billion.  </P></p>

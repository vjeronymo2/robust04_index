Last year these departments  achieved a total import-export volume of $2.34 billion, an  increase of 16 percent over the previous year; of this amount,  $1.61 billion was obtained from exports.    At a provincial foreign economic relations and trade work  meeting on 27 January, provincial party and government leaders  Chen Bangzhu, Liu Fusheng, Wang Keying, Tang Zhixiang, and He  Shaoqing fully confirmed their achievements.    Earlier this year, the province was facing unprecedented  difficulties in foreign economic relations and trade. The  provincial foreign economic relations and trade commission  pointed out the need to maximize export earnings. As a result,  the province freed itself from this predicament. By the end of  last year, 37 of the 41 foreign trade enterprises and companies  directly under the provincial authorities had carried out the  provincial task, and 36 of the 55 enterprises and scientific  research institutions with export operational rights increased  their foreign exchange earnings.    On foreign economic relations, last year the province  approved the establishment of 1,360 new three-capital  enterprises. The foreign capital actually used by three-capital  enterprises totaled $1.03 billion and their foreign exchange  earnings topped $100 million.    After listening to this feedback report, Governor Chen  Bangzhu made an important speech on this year's foreign economic  relations and trade. He pointed out: The key to expanding  foreign exchange earnings and improving economic results is to  adjust and optimize the mix of export commodities and to improve  their quality. We should strengthen our investment guidance,  pay close attention to the management of three-capital  enterprises, and further improve our investment environment.</p>

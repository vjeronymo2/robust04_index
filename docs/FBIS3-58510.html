British and other diplomats yesterday made little secret of  their distaste at Greece's treatment of the Balkan country given  diplomatic recognition last month by six of the 12 EC countries.       "They won't give the Macedonians visas. In fact, they are  being about as bloody as they could possibly be," said one  Western source.    Greeks suspect Germany and Britain of granting diplomatic  recognition to gain influence in the Balkans.    Despite taking over the presidency of the EC Council, Mr  Papandreou's Government has stopped supply of vital goods, from  washing machine parts to food, mainly because domestic pressure  over Macedonia is so strong. Greek workers at oil terminals in  Thessaloniki this week volunteered to stop shipments to  Macedonia in anger at its use of a name they say can be applied  only to their northern province.    The Greek blockade has left the border roads deserted, and  economic conditions in the former Yugoslav republic have  worsened, with pay cuts and falling national output.    The barter system has collapsed with the break-up of  Yugoslavia, and drought has put two of the country's  hydro-electric plants out of service.    Many of the 600,000 inhabitants of Skopje, the capital, are  dependent on the "Makedonia" oil refinery for their livelihoods,  and now depend on it for fuel, giving Greece an effective  stranglehold. Mr. Tony Millson, the new British ambassador to  Macedonia, said: "The oil trains are still coming through from  Thessaloniki, otherwise we wouldn't be sitting here with the  lights on."    Shops and markets are also still stocked with food, but  inflation is running at 230 percent.    Western officials close to the sanctions-monitoring  operation  said Albania tried to appease Athens, offering to avoid use of  the name Macedonia on shipments to Greece, substituting "Chamber  of Commerce of Skopje." Skopje is Greece's preferred name for  the state.    Britain and others are trying to step up pressure on Athens  by touting plans for an East-West corridor, running from Albania  to Bulgaria via Macedonia. They hope this would make Macedonia  less dependent on Greece.</p>

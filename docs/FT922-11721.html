			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Big quake shakes California A STRONG earthquake rocked southern California on Wednesday night, across 200 miles from the Mexican border to Santa Barbara. Seismologists said there was a 10-25 per cent chance that the shock, and one a few hours earlier, might herald an even stronger quake within the next three days. In Los Angeles, buildings swayed for several seconds, telephone services and electricity supplies were temporarily disrupted. Initial reports suggested that damage was light with only minor injuries. The quake, just before 10pm local time, measured 6.1 on the Richter scale, said seismologists at the California Institute of Technology. Six on the scale means ability to inflict 'severe damage'. The epicentre was 10 miles east of Desert Hot Springs, which is about 100 miles east of Los Angeles. The tremor was believed to be a shift on the San Andreas Fault, which runs the length of California. Two hours earlier, a shock of 4.6 on the Richter scale had shaken the region.</p>

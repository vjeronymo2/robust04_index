			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, Feb 28, BNS -- It is still premature at  present to say that Russian troops will leave Estonia by Aug.  31, a high-ranking Russian foreign ministry official said in a  telephone interview with BNS today. The diplomat also referred  to his country having no formal obligation to pull its units out  from Estonia by that date.    Alexandr Udaltsev, official in charge of relations with the  Baltics at the Russian Foreign Ministry, said Russia during the  talks between the two countries had considered "the possibility  to shift forward" the deadline for the troop withdrawal after  Estonia, in his words, had failed to abide by certain promises  it had given earlier.    "The issue, in particular, was about Estonia going to  provide  23 million U.S. dollars for the building of houses for the  officers to be repatriated," Udaltsev said, adding that there  had also been a number of other issues the deadline was linked  to. "Not a single one of these has been fulfilled by the  Estonian side," he said.    "In such a situation, naturally, the (final) date of the  withdrawal is, at least, under question," he said.    He reminded that Russia had taken upon itself no obligation  with respect to the pullout deadline.    "The topic of money, to our regret, no longer arises, since  the Estonian party has shown itself as not being serious about  it," he said.    Udaltsev said the main problem that bars way to an agreement  on Russian troop withdrawal from Estonia now is the issue of  signing a package of accords. Russia is insisting that  agreements on social security guarantees for retired Russian  military and their family members in Estonia be signed in one  single package with the army pullout agreement.    "This is our initial position," Udaltsev said. He claimed  that such a position on the issue was in compliance with rulings  by international organizations, which demand the withdrawal of  Russian units from the Baltics to take place "speedily, orderly,  and according to the respective agreements." "Our partners in  the Baltics for some reason or another are emphasizing only the  first of these words, somehow forgetting about the two others,"  Udaltsev said.    The Russian diplomat said it was crucial that at the current  round of talks, scheduled to begin in Tallinn Tuesday [1 March],  "all attention would be focused" on social security guarantees  for the some 11,000 retired Russian military and 30,000 members  of their families, remaining in Estonia.    Udaltsev was pessimistic about the possibility that Estonia  would grant permanent resident's status to these people, saying  he feared the Baltic country was unlikely to "take a  constructive approach" to the issue.    As another issue Russia views is preventing progress toward  a  solution of the topic of the withdrawal, Udaltsev mentioned  reciprocal claims over property and damages. The diplomat said  his country suggested a "zero option," when Russia would give up  claims for compensation for the property it leaves behind in  Estonia, while Estonia would not claim anything for damages  inflicted by the Russian army on its soil. The two parties so  far have failed to agree on a mutually acceptable formulation  for the issue, he said.    Udaltsev's remarks today come as an indication that Russia  is  going to cancel the Aug. 31, 1994, deadline it suggested for the  withdrawal of its troops from Estonia at negotiations late last  year. Russia then said it would pull its remaining about 2,500  troops from Estonia by that date, but soon declined to present  to Estonia a detailed timetable for the withdrawal. Russia said  failure at the talks to settle the issue of social welfare and  guarantees for military pensioners was the reason of the delay.    Estonia at the beginning of this year declared agreeing with  the troop withdrawal deadline offered by Russia.</p>

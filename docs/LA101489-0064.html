			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNIST-LED UNIONS HOLD 1ST PROTEST AGAINST SOLIDARITY RULE  </P> <P> This country' Communist-led labor unions staged their first demonstration  Friday against the Solidarity-led government.  </P> <P> Union leader Alfred Miodowicz and about 150 supporters demonstrated in  drizzling rain outside Parliament to protest an "avalanche of price rises"  under the month-old government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.  </P> <P> Miodowicz, whose unions claim 7 million members, said supporters were tired of  "paper protests" and wanted action. "This demonstration in the rain is one of  the signs that we are starting protests of a new type," he said.  </P> <P> He said the economic crisis had turned Poland into a powder keg and rough times  were ahead that could eventually bring the end of Mazowiecki's government.  </P> <P> Food prices in Poland rose 187% in August and 51% in September after the former  Communist government lifted price controls. Officials in the present government  fear inflation may reach 900% to 1,000% by the end of the year.  </P> <P> Miodowicz and his mainly elderly supporters staged the union protest as  Parliament debated a bill to index wages by pegging them to increases in the  cost-of-living.  </P> <P> A delegation handed a petition calling the bill ill-prepared and inadequate to  Speaker Mikolaj Kozakiewicz. Most working families were having to reduce  consumption and many were reaching the brink of poverty, the petition said.  </P> <P> Miodowicz said workers should receive full compensation for price boosts, not  just the 80% proposed in the bill.  </P> <P> Miodowicz, a few months ago one of Poland's rulers on the Communist Party  Politburo, said he did not agree with recent warnings of civil war by  Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.  </P> <P> But he said Poland was like a time bomb.  </P> <P> "The present situation is very difficult, we are sitting on a powder keg,"  Miodowicz said. "Who or what is going to put out the fire? It's like a time  bomb. . . ."  </P></p>

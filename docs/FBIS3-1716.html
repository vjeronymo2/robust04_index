			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Report on Current Events" program] </F>   [Text] Listeners: Following the adoption of the partial  political reform package by the Hong Kong Legislative Council  [Legco] on 24 February, the British Government published a white  paper on the Hong Kong issue, unilaterally disclosing the  contents of the Sino-British talks on the Hong Kong issue. This  has pushed the Sino-British talks to a state in which it cannot  be saved [wu fa wan hui di jing di]. The following is a roundup  prepared by our station reporter: "The Hong Kong Issue Has  Become a Focus of Attention in Beijing."    On the same day the British Government published the white  paper and the Legco adopted the partial political reform  package, the spokesmen of the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the  Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office separately issued statements,  pointing out that the British side has closed the door to the  Sino-British talks. The spokesmen said: Prior to the opening of  the talks, both China and Hong Kong had reached an understanding  of not disclosing the contents of the talks. The British  Government in Hong Kong has acted in disregard of the repeated  advice from the Chinese side and the wishes of all circles of  Hong Kong that China and Britain resolve the question on the  arrangements for the 1994-95 election through negotiations.  This has fully demonstrated that the British side is not  sincere about cooperating with the Chinese side to resolve the  Hong Kong issue.    On 24 and 25 February, the Preliminary Working Committee  [PWC] of the Hong Kong Special Autonomous Region [HKSAR]  Preparatory Committee held a special group meeting in Beijing.  The meeting attracted numerous reporters from Mainland China  and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. The special meeting, held by  the Political Affairs Group, mainly discussed and studied the  relationship between the administrative and legislative organs  in Hong Kong after 1997, the measures for the creation of the  first government, and other issues. Under the current  circumstance, the Political Affairs Group, which was established  by the Chinese National People's Congress [NPC] to study the  future of Hong Kong, is playing an increasingly noticeable role.  Xiao Weiyun, head of the Political Affairs Group, told  reporters that Chris Patten's political reform program violates  the Sino-British declaration, the HKSAR Basic Law, and  agreements reached between China and Britain. In the face of  the fact that his political reform program has been approved,  there is no doubt that the Chinese Government will set up a  separate kitchen [ling qi lu zao] based on the basic law. For  this purpose, the PWC will step up its preparatory work in a  concrete way to ensure Hong Kong's smooth transition and its  long-term stability and prosperity.    On the evening of 25 February, Chinese Premier Li Peng, Vice  Chairmen Li Lanqing, and Zou Jiahua, as well as other state  leaders attended a soiree sponsored by the PWC to celebrate the  arrival of spring. Premier Li Peng made an impromptu speech at  the soiree. Speaking of Hong Kong's situation, he said that  China today is no longer what it was 150 years ago. At present,  China has a growing economy and enjoys political stability. We  are full of confidence in China's future. In his speech, the  premier once again emphasized that no matter what happens, the  Chinese Government will not change its determination to resume  Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong, and that Hong Kong will  definitely achieve a smooth transition and long-term stability  and prosperity.</p>

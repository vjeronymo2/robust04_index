			<p>BFN     [Text] The MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party]-SZDSZ [Alliance  of Free Democrats] coalition talks ended a short while ago.  Organizational and personnel matters were the focus of the  talks. Attila Csaszar, our staff member, sent the following  report from the site:    [Csaszar] The coalition talks ended just a short time before  the beginning of this program. For the time being, here are  some brief notes on the results.    The MSZP, the winner of the elections, will have nine  ministries in the future government, while the SZDSZ will have  three: the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Culture and  Public Education, and the infrastructure portfolio [Ministry of  Transport, Telecommunications, and Water Management]. Political  state secretaries will be provided by the MSZP. Names have not  yet been mentioned, according to SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Petoe.    An agreement has also been reached on which party will  provide the parliamentary speaker. This post will be filled by  an MSZP deputy. The three deputy speakers will be nominated by  the SZDSZ, the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum], and the FKGP  [Independent Smallholders Party]. The FKGP will have the  opportunity to delegate a deputy speaker only if it signs the  six-party agreement on parliamentary matters.    A preliminary decision was taken on matters relating to  parliamentary committees. The SZDSZ can delegate the chairmen  of three committees -- the Constitutional, Defense, and Foreign  Affairs Committees. The chairmen of the other committees will  be delegated by the MSZP. The opposition is still expected to  make demands in this matter, however.    It was also said that in the current situation, the two  sides  might even sign the coalition agreements as early as Friday. It  is also very likely that in accordance with earlier reports,  Gyula Horn will be the prime minister.</p>

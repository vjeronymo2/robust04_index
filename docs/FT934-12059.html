			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Globex faces reshaping GLOBEX, the electronic futures trading system developed by Reuters and the world's two largest futures exchanges, is likely to be radically restructured, when the agreement between its backers is renegotiated in April. Yesterday, the chairmen of both the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange - two of the three backers of the Dollars 80m (Pounds 54m) system - jockeyed for position, as one announced that he would be willing to give up some control of the system, while the other arrived in London for private talks with Reuters. Launched 18 months ago, Globex has been dogged by low trading volume, delays in gaining regulatory approval to install screens, unwillingness of other exchanges to sign up, and bickering between the two exchanges. Looking ahead to the April negotiations, Mr Pat Arbor, CBOT chairman, said his exchange was prepared to give up control of the day-to-day running of the system to attract other exchanges. Globex 'will look more democratic, more open, more like a utility.' Currently, Reuters operates the system, but the two exchanges control trading on it. Other exchanges, including the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange, have said they were unwilling to surrender control of their products to competitors by joining. Reuters will have the option to pull out of Globex in April, because the CBOT and CME will not have met trading targets of 50,000 contracts a day between them on the system. Currently, they are trading around 5,000 contracts a day. Globex needs to attract new exchanges in order to boost volume and allow Reuters to recoup its estimated Dollars 75m investment. Only France's Matif has joined so far. Reuters declined to comment yesterday, but, in a recent interview with the Financial Times, Ms Rosalyn Wilton, managing director of Reuters transaction products, said: 'We want to explore all the various avenues and opportunities. We want to be able to do something that is right for the marketplace.' She added: 'One could ask what is the way to make it easier (for other exchanges) and to inspire more confidence.' It emerged yesterday that Mr Jack Sandner, the CME chairman, has come to London for private discussions with Mr Peter Job, chief executive of Reuters. Mr Sandner said he would talk about the CME's 'long-term relationship with Reuters'.</p>

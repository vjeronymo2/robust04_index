			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Realtor to Buy KDAY-AM: Southland realtor Fred C. Sands has agreed to acquire  Los Angeles radio station KDAY-AM from Dallas-based Heritage Media Corp. for  $7.2 million.  </P> <P> The sale is subject to approval by the Federal Communications Commission.  Sands, who also owns rock music station KNAC-FM in Long Beach, said he has no  plans to change KDAY's urban contemporary format. Heritage Media said it  decided to sell KDAY because it wanted to concentrate on FM radio stations and  on AM/FM combinations.  </P></p>

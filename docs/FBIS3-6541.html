"I have a feeling that the economy has already hit bottom,"  Toshiomi Uragami, chairman of the Life Insurance Association of  Japan, told a regular monthly press conference.    Some bright signs are seen in the latest macroeconomic  statistics, and as for life insurers, new contracts have  improved recently, he noted.    But a "sharp" economic recovery is unlikely as corporate  capital spending remains sluggish, he said.    Against this backdrop, Japanese stock prices can be expected  to "move even more firmly if clearer signs of a recovery are  presented," said Uragami who heads the group which in effect  combines the country's largest institutional investors.    Uragami noted that stock prices are now hovering around  20,000 on the key Nikkei index of 225 selected issues, with  buying led by foreign investors continuing on hopes of an  economic upturn.    Long-term rates are unlikely to continue rising and put a  damper on the economy, Uragami said. "Seen as a long-term rate,  4 percent is not a level to worry about."    The yield on the benchmark government bond rose over the  past  two months to briefly touch the 4 percent level for the first  time since the Bank of Japan last cut its discount rate in  September.    Market dealers attributed the rise to hopes of an economic  recovery and concerns over a market glut with the government  boosting its bond issuance.    The bond yield recently gained stability to move below 4  percent, but Japanese banks are to raise their long-term prime  lending rates to more than 4 percent in April.</p>

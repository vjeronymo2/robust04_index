			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While the 8.5/91.5 blend is compatible with most of the materials now sterilized with 12/88, it must be used at higher operating pressures than 12/88 systems and hence is not a direct drop-in replacement for 12/88. Use of CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  blends requires that the sterilizing unit be retrofitted to handle higher operating pressures in order to prevent excessive leakages of EtO from the system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and EtO tend to separate while stored in pressurized containers. Thus, initial discharges from the canisters during use may contain excessively high amounts of flammable EtO; final discharges from nearly empty canisters may contain pure CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and may not effectively sterilize equipment. To overcome this problem, single ``unit dose'' canisters have been developed for use in conjunction with CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  sterilizers. For safe operation, these canisters must be connected and disconnected from the sterilizing unit before and after every use, thereby increasing the risk of accidental exposure. Improved training procedures will be required with such systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pure EtO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Pure EtO systems can also be used in place of current 12/88 sterilizers. By itself, EtO is toxic, carcinogenic, and flammable. It is also explosive at concentrations above 3 percent in air. Thus, additional precautions must be taken to limit occupational exposures and conflagration. Present OSHA standards and proper engineering controls have demonstrated their ability to provide for safe operation of such systems. Pure EtO systems are currently used by many contract sterilizers, large hospitals, and other large users.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Listing Decisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Acceptable substitutes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . (1) HCFC&hyph;124. HCFC&hyph;124 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in EtO blends. Initial testing in hospital, industrial, and laboratory settings indicates that an EtO/HCFC&hyph;124 blend can serve as a virtual drop-in replacement for 12/88, enabling users to transition away from CFC&hyph;12 while still using their existing equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Use of HCFC&hyph;124 in sterilizers will allow significant reductions in skin cancer cases and deaths resulting from ozone depletion. HCFC&hyph;124 has an ODP of only 0.02. Modeling results indicate that even if HCFC&hyph;124 replaces all current use of CFC&hyph;12 in sterilization, resulting skin cancer deaths in the total US population born before 2030 will total only 600 more than if a zero ODP substitute were available. In addition, the low GWP of HCFC&hyph;124 ensures that use of the chemical in sterilizers will have a negligible effect on global warming.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under Title III of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Agency is required to regulate any of the 189 hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). Ethylene oxide is a HAP, and the user is alerted to follow all upcoming regulations concerning the use of ethylene oxide, whether used alone or in a blend. For example, it is likely in the future that Title III will require a system that prevents venting of EtO into the atmosphere, therefore users installing new HCFC&hyph;124/EtO systems may choose to take this into consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in EtO blends used for sterilization. Carbon dioxide can effectively reduce the flammability of EtO and does not deplete stratospheric ozone. Most CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  currently used in sterilant mixtures is the recaptured by-product of other chemical processes, so its manufacture for use in sterilizers should not increase emissions to the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is an asphyxiant in high concentrations, but engineering controls designed to limit occupational exposures from the more toxic EtO will also serve to prevent potentially lethal exposures to CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Blends of CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and EtO are commercially available at present, and proven process cycles already exist. Blends of CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and EtO have been in widespread use for years and dominated the market before the development of 12/88. Recent regulations issued by DOT have prompted manufacturers to change the formulation of the blend to 8.5/91.5 EtO/CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  due to flammability concerns. As mentioned above, ethylene oxide is a HAP, and the user is alerted to follow all upcoming regulations under Title III of the Clean Air Act Amendments concerning the use of ethylene oxide, whether used alone or in a blend.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Pure EtO. Pure EtO is acceptable as a substitute for 12/88 in sterilization. By itself, EtO is neither an ozone depleting substance nor a contributor to global warming. However, EtO is toxic, carcinogenic, and flammable. While these factors must be considered in the decision to approve EtO as a substitute for 12/88 and must be considered by users selecting appropriate substitutes for their current use of 12/88, the Agency considers current applicable standards and operating procedures (such as OSHA standards for occupational exposure) sufficient to protect human health and the environment. Thus, pure EtO systems are acceptable substitutes for 12/88. Users are advised to adhere to all existing workplace standards and to train workers in the proper operation of EtO equipment. Historical experience with pure EtO systems indicates that they can be used safely when operated in accordance with such guidelines. Because of the threat posed to the general population by vented EtO, the Agency also recommends that pure EtO systems be used in conjunction with emission control technologies such as catalytic converters or acid water scrubbers to prevent exposures of the general population to dangerous levels of EtO.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As mentioned above, ethylene oxide is a HAP, and the user is alerted to the probability of future regulations under Title III of the Clean Air Act Amendments concerning the use of ethylene oxide, whether used alone or in a blend.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Steam. Steam sterilization is acceptable as a substitute for 12/88 in sterilization. As mentioned above, steam sterilization can be used on devices that can withstand high temperature and very high humidity. The use of steam sterilization can be increased by separating heat and moisture sensitive devices from resistant ones.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Unacceptable substitutes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . (None).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Aerosols  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Overview  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To provide perspective on EPA's decisions in the aerosols sector, this section presents first an overview of important related regulations affecting aerosols. Subsequent parts of the section describe the substitutes in the aerosols sector and present EPA's decisions on the substitutes. The decisions are summarized in Appendix B at the end of this notice. The proposed decisions presented in this section are based on the risk screen contained in the draft background document entitled ``Risk Screen on the Use of Substitutes for Class I Ozone-Depleting Substances: Aerosols.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

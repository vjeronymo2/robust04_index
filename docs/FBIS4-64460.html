			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Foreign Minister Warns of New Enemy </F> Image"]    [Text] Mannheim, 3 May -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel  and his Dutch counterpart Pieter Kooijmanns have warned against  building up the image of Islam as the new enemy in Europe after  the end of the East-West antagonism. At the first  German-Netherlands ambassadors' conference in Mannheim on  Tuesday [3 May], the two officials came out in favor of  conducting a frank and critical dialogue with the Islamic states  and promoting mutual understanding by getting to know one  another better.    The German and Netherlands ambassadors to Algeria, Egypt,  Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Turkey participated in the conference.  The exchange of opinions focused on questions of stability in  the southern Mediterranean region and in the Middle East.    Kooijmans said that Islam was in many cases equated with  extremism and fundamentalism. While extremism was dangerous, it  was not immediately connected with Islam. There were fanatics  in other religions too, Kooijmans stated, adding that the  Europeans should not be guided by fear of the Islamic world.</p>

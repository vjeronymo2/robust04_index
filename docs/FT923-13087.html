			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Restored to life The Phoenix and Firkin public house at Denmark Hill station, south-east London, may inspire companies tempted by the prospect of using railway property for new enterprises. The pub, built on a road bridge across the railway, was about to be demolished by British Rail when it was redeveloped in 1984 by Mr David Bruce, the then head of the Firkin chain of pubs, now owned by Allied Breweries.</p>

			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Economic Notebooks: Bumps ahead on the road to UK recovery HAS the time come to call a turning point in the UK economy? After 18 months of withering green shoots and a mixed bag of economic statistics in December, it is both safe and tempting to stay gloomy about Britain's economic prospects. But there are growing signs that the economy has turned and that the end of the longest recession since the Second World War is in sight. What is certain is that the next few months will not feel much like a recovery. Unemployment will continue to rise as the redundancies announced in recent months work through into the number of unemployed claiming benefit. Gloom will spread from the European continent where the German economy is turning down sharply, dragging the remaining members of the exchange rate mechanism in its wake. But there are hopeful signs for Britain, especially compared with a year ago. Last week's FT survey of forecasts for the UK economy was notable in that none of the 38 universities, inter-governmental institutions, independent think tanks and City investment houses predicted a further contraction of the economy in 1993. On average, the forecasters came to the same conclusion as the Treasury's Autumn Statement forecast in projecting modest 1 per cent growth next year. Twelve months ago, by contrast, forecasters were frantically slashing forecasts and the Treasury itself was acknowledging that it had been over-optimistic in predicting 2.25 per cent growth for 1992 less than two months earlier in its autumn 1991 forecast. Cautious optimism about next year has been reinforced by reports of a late rush in pre-Christmas shopping, the strength of UK equities in December, particularly among the mid-250 where capital goods issues are strongly represented, and the 29 per cent jump in new car sales in the first 20 days of this month. Local chambers of commerce report more hope among businesses. Mr Richard Brown, director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, says early returns for the chambers' late January survey point to a sharp jump in business confidence in the fourth quarter, although from an admittedly low base in the third quarter. The chambers of commerce and the Confederation of British Industry say industry's export order books have improved since September. Looking ahead, there are hopes that sterling's devaluation since September and increasingly strong economic growth in the US and Latin America will open up opportunities for exporters to offset more difficult times on the European continent. At home, the beneficial effects of the three percentage point cut in bank base rates in the last three months has still to be passed on fully to mortgage holders. This will happen in the first quarter when building societies and banks which adjust mortgage rates annually will be making changes. The potential benefits for mortgage holders of the interest rate cut are huge. Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist at Kleinwort Benson, calculates that homeowners will be Pounds 20bn better off next year than three years ago when the government held base rates at 15 per cent for 12 months, causing households to pay Pounds 40bn in mortgage interest in 1990. But caution is still the watchword. As Mr Spencer points out: 'Economic recoveries are rather like pregnancies. They are never confirmed until some time after they have taken place.' He expects no clear signs of recovery until the spring. Similarly, Prof Douglas McWilliams, who recently stepped down as chief economic adviser to the CBI to set up his own Centre for Economics and Business Research, warns: 'We have stabilised, we are not yet going up.' Prof McWilliams says that most of the companies that he deals with are planning for a flat year in 1993. He predicts some bumpy months for the economy and at best a very slow recovery with company boards under pressure to boost profits. In a difficult domestic and international climate, companies will be under strong pressure to continue cutting costs and shedding staff. Mr Spencer argues that it is wiser to view 1993 as a year of winners and losers rather than to hope for buoyant growth. Among the winners will be exporters that had already cut costs sharply in expectation of Britain staying in the ERM. They will now benefit strongly from the pound's devaluation. Another group of potential winners are first-time house buyers, who stand to benefit from low interest rates, low house prices and who will not be encumbered by the loss of equity in existing homes caused by falling house prices. Whether buyers will return to the housing market remains one of the great uncertainties of 1993. Recent large-scale debt repayments by industry and consumers suggest that the traumas of overindebtedness in the late 1980s continue to cast a cloud over borrowing throughout the economy. The UK may be in a similar position to the US in the summer when many of the motors of growth were beginning to turn but there was little sign of activity. In one respect, however, the UK faces recovery in a far worse condition than could have been imagined a year ago. The government's own finances have deteriorated dramatically during 1992. The FT survey of economists' forecasts suggested that the public sector borrowing requirement in 1993-94 could jump to Pounds 46.9bn, with one forecaster forecasting a PSBR as high as Pounds 58bn next year. While the Treasury hopes that financial markets will be tolerant of the deficit so long as the economy is depressed, Mr Brown says the government's budgetary problems are beginning to weigh on business sentiment, with members fearing raised taxes. In these circumstances, it is a happy chance that the government is allowing itself two budgets this year. It could use the last of its traditional revenue raising budgets in March to boost confidence and recovery before turning in the first of its unified budgets in December to the daunting task of repairing the UK's public finances.</p>

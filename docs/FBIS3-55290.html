			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Shaposhnikova report: "SCSE Deputies"] </F>   [Text] At a Supreme Court session yesterday examining the  State Committee for the State of Emergency case Anatoliy  Lukyanov's and Vasiliy Starodubtsev's lawyers once again made a  statement regarding the dismissal of the case against their  clients in accordance with Article 98 of the Constitution  concerning the privilege of the corps of deputies. What is  more, the lawyer Genrikh Padva even read out a New Year message  from Boris Yeltsin to his new comrade-in-arms Anatoliy Lukyanov,  in which the president voiced hope for their mutual fruitful  cooperation.    The prosecution responded to the defense statement with a  different explanation of the selfsame Article 98 of the  Constitution. In the opinion of the prosecutor's office, it is  not a question of universal, but only of limited [usechennyy]  immunity, namely from detention, arrest, and searches. No more.  And that is why interpretation of the contentious article is  needed from the Constitutional Court, a body to which either the  president himself, people's deputies, or members of government  can appeal with queries. And since this is an extremely lengthy  procedure, the prosecution asked the case of Lukyanov and  Starodubtsev be be treated separately [vydelit delo Lukyanova i  Starodubtseva v otdelnoye deloproizvodstvo].    However, after a long meeting the Supreme Court rejected  both  the lawyers' arguments and the prosecution's waverings. The  trial of State Duma Deputy Anatoliy Lukyanov and Federation  Council member Vasiliy Starodubtsev will be continued after 10  January.    The following question arises in this connection: Where is  Lukyanov to go after Christmas -- to the Duma to "share  responsibility with the president for the fate of Russia" or to  the dock? And if he nonetheless prefers the Duma, what will the  court do then? After all, under Article 98 he can no longer be  taken there by force!</p>

			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL;  </P> <P> NOTRE DAME ADVANCES ON RATLIFF'S BLAST  </P> <P> Senior shortstop Chad Ratliff lined a two-run home run with two out in the top  of the eighth inning to lead Notre Dame High past North Torrance, 8-4, in a  championship semifinal game of the Redondo-Palos Verdes tournament Saturday at  North Torrance.  </P> <P> Ratliff's first home run of the season broke a 4-4 tie and sparked what would  become a four-run rally.  </P> <P> Ratliff, who led the team in hitting last season with a .442 average but has  fallen to .260 this year, may be getting back on track.  </P> <P> "It's real nice to see him back in the groove," Notre Dame Coach Bob Mandeville  said. "We can use his stick."  </P> <P> Notre Dame (17-3) will play for the title Saturday at 7 p.m. at Redondo High  against Lakewood, a 1-0 winner over Palos Verdes.  </P> <P> Sophomore right-hander Steve Colella (5-3), who relieved starter Cary Wichmann  in the sixth, pitched three innings of scoreless relief, striking out four and  walking none.  </P> <P> "That was one of Colella's best outings in a long time," Mandeville said.  </P> <P> Senior catcher Bobby Hughes was three for three with two doubles, Chris Lohman  was three for five and Kevin Milligan was two for three with two runs batted in  for Notre Dame, which had 15 hits and stranded 13 runners.  </P> <P> In other Redondo-Palos Verdes tournament games:  </P> <P> Westchester 7, Royal 6 -- Host Westchester (8-11) used a four-run third inning  and a controversial call in the fifth to win the consolation game.  </P> <P> Trailing, 7-5, in the fifth inning, Royal (9-14) was in the midst of a rally  when Will Egan's run was disallowed because he removed his helmet while running  from third to home. The Highlanders gave up three of Westchester's four  third-inning runs on two errors.  </P> <P> Royal's Jason Jones was four for four with two home runs a triple and four  RBIs.  </P> <P> Richard Naranjo was two for four with an RBI and Sean Mitchell was two for four  with a run scored for the Highlanders.  </P> <P> Culver City 7, Alemany 3 -- Alemany had 11 hits, but stranded 10 runners in a  fourth-round consolation bracket game at Alemany.  </P> <P> Jon Beauchemin was three for four and Joey Rosselli was two for four with a  home run for Alemany (13-10). John Lite pitched three scoreless innings of  relief for Alemany, allowing only two hits.  </P> <P> Crespi 11, Leuzinger 10 -- Crespi scored five runs on four hits and two errors  in the fourth inning and weathered the Olympians' three-run seventh in a  consolation semifinal game at Valley College.  </P> <P> Catcher John Dempsey ended Leuzinger's late rally by picking off a runner at  first base.  </P> <P> Dempsey and Chris Romero each had two hits and two RBIs.  </P> <P> Chad Nichols (2-3) got the win for the Celts (8-11-2), who used four pitchers  and three catchers.  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks 19, West Torrance 5 -- Lance Martin had a three-run home run in  the fifth and knocked in five runs to lead the Lancers in a consolation bracket  game at West Torrance.  </P> <P> Brent Christenson hit a three-run home run in the sixth for Thousand Oaks  (10-7), which used six pitchers who combined to throw a four-hitter.  </P> <P> Scott Haffner was four for five with three RBIs for Thousand Oaks, which jumped  to a 5-0 lead in the first and led, 17-3, after six.  </P> <P> HERITAGE LEAGUE  </P> <P> Ribet Academy 12, L. A. Lutheran 7 -- Ribet Academy scored 10 unearned runs at  L. A. Lutheran. Jim Brown had three hits and Travis Canel and Don Phillips each  had two for L.A. Lutheran.  </P></p>

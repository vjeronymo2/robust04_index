			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "American Logic"] </F>   [Text] That nothing much has changed in Indo-American  relations after Mr Strobe Talbott's and Ms Robin Raphel's recent  efforts to soothe ruffled Indian feathers is evident from a  recent unambiguous enunciation of the U.S. line towards this  country by Mr Lee Hamilton, chairman of the foreign affairs  committee of the U.S. House of Representatives. The senator is  partly right in saying that the current "acrimony and  bitterness" are the result of the Indian belief that a  Democratic administration should be more friendly towards India  than a Republican one. If, as he says, things have not quite  worked out that way, it is presumably because Mr Clinton's  ignorance about the complexities of politics in this part of the  world has been compounded by the strange conviction in  Washington apparently shared by both the Democrats and the  Republicans that only the American viewpoint is valid.  Otherwise, it is difficult to follow the logic of some of Mr  Hamilton's observations. For instance, he wants India not to  deploy the Prithvi missile as this will lead to greater tensions  in South Asia, but it does not strike him that Pakistan's  acquisition of more F-16s may do the same. Referring to India's  contention that its security concerns relate to China as well,  Mr Hamilton argues that Prithvi can be used only against  Pakistan. But against whom will the F-16s, the M-11s and the  Hatf missiles be used?    The real thrust of Mr Hamilton's remarks is evident,  however,  in his gratuitous advice to India that it should aspire for a  close partnership with the United States. His concept of  partnership, however, is akin to what Ayub Khan once found hard  to accept, as is clear from the title of his autobiography,  Friends, Not Masters. With disarming candour, the  good senator wants India to accept the fact that the United  States today is the only superpower, for if it does not, "an  antagonistic America would pose a substantial obstacle to Indian  aspirations." Clearly, the principle of agreeing to disagree  which is central to all democracies is currently at a discount  in Washington. Mr Hamilton has also spelt out how the United  States will bring India into line (for a close partnership, of  course): "The U.S. support for concessional financing from the  World Bank and the IMF is crucial if India hopes to address the  economic and social needs of the people." The threat is obvious  and even tends to confirm the long-standing Leftist belief that  the two organisations are mere extensions of the American  foreign policy establishment. But perhaps the most extraordinary  part of Mr Hamilton's speech was his explanation for the current  calm in Punjab--the ruthlessness of the Indian security forces  "in suppressing the insurgency." His belief, however, that the  people of Punjab may still be dissatisfied underlines a touching  concern for popular feelings that was not much in evidence when  the United States backed any number of brutal dictators ranging  from Syngman Rhee, Ferdinand Marcos and Lon Nol to the Shah of  Iran, Papa Doc and Baby Doc and General Pinochet.</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Woolwich launches two rescue plans WOOLWICH, the third largest building society, has launched two mortgage rescue schemes at a cost of Pounds 60m to save from eviction borrowers who are seriously behind with their payments. The schemes are part of moves by lenders to help stem a flood of mortgage repossessions - expected to reach 80,000 this year  - and follow talks between lenders and the government just before Christmas, in which Pounds 800m was pledged for the schemes. Woolwich's first rescue scheme is aimed at families whose incomes have fallen since they bought their homes but who are not eligible for social security income support and so cannot make normal payments on their mortgages. Three housing associations, London &amp; Quadrant, Circle 33 and Metropolitan Housing, will buy the homes from their occupants at the current open market valuation, allowing their former owners to remain as tenants. Woolwich yesterday declined to comment on the interest rate which the housing associations will pay it for the funding but it is understood to be between 3.5 per cent and 5 per cent. Under a second scheme the occupants will remain owners but will be charged interest at rates below the market level in return for Woolwich becoming a part owner of the house. The society will own the stake in the house until it is sold or the equity share is repaid. Most of the families affected are in London and the south-east. The Pounds 60m will enable Woolwich to rescue between 600 and 800 households from eviction.</p>

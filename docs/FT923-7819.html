			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Books: Slave trade's market forces BLACK IVORY by James Walvin HarperCollins Pounds 20, 365 pages 'AS A result of the slave trade, more than 11 million Africans were deposited in the Americas', Walvin writes. 'But a huge number did not reach the colonies; millions more died en route to the African coast and on the slave ships in mid-ocean. The 11 million who arrived were the survivors of perhaps more than 24 million enslaved in Africa.' The chief reason why such a massive transhumance of slaves was possible in the first place is that slavery was an established practice in Africa and has indeed survived there to this day. Africans enslaved Africans: the Europeans were the big buyers of the day, who raised the pace of slave trading into a growth industry, complete with solid back-up support systems, including forts at the points of embarkation on African soil. African chieftains wanted European goods, chiefly guns. Europeans, for their part, needed slave labour, because long before the cotton fields of America's southern states became the symbol of negro slaves' misery, Europe's growing appetite for sugar, tobacco, coffee and rice was turning these from luxuries into consumer commodities. Without the muscles of the African slaves, the plantations in the Americas could not have prospered and the considerable commercial benefits to Europe would not have materialised. Without slavery Liverpool would not have become the boom port it was during the 18th century. Thus, economic forces - then, as now, often a sanitised term for greed - encouraged too many Europeans to bend Christian ethics so as to view the African as a creature somewhat inferior to a human being. The history of African slaves shipped to the New World begins in the latter part of the 16th century. Abolition of the slave trade by Britain and the US came in 1807. But the trade continued in bootleg fashion well past that date and beyond 1838, when slavery was altogether abolished in Britain. The appalling degradation the slaves endured, on the way to their terminal servitude and thereafter, is well-catalogued here. The main thrust, however, is the mutual influence between the enslaving societies and the emerging Creole culture of the enslaved Africans. Slaves ran away, revolted, had Christianity thrust upon them, but above all they evinced a sustained resilience which eventually enabled their descendants to inherit a vibrant ethnic identity. The process of symbiotic coexistence could often produce fine irony, as in the case of Lady Nugent who, visiting Jamaica in 1802, wrote in her diary: 'The Creole language is not confined to the negroes. Many of the ladies, who have not been educated in England, speak a sort of broken English . . . I stood next to a lady one night, near a window, and by way of saying something, remarked that the air was much cooler than usual; to which she remarked 'Yes, ma-am, him rail-y too fraish.'' An irony of graver historical import surfaces in connection with the French Revolution, the seismic ripples of which soon washed over the slave and enslaving communities in the Americas to telling effect: a series of armed revolts in the former, fear and repression in the latter. Yet for all the Revolution's message of hope to mankind, French slaves were not emancipated until 1848. In Britain, the fight for the abolition of slavery often resembled in tone today's argument for a green world. Opposition to it was often voiced with astonishing reasoning: 'In 1789, the London MP and former Lord Mayor of London Nathaniel Newnham opposed abolition because it would, if carried, fill the city with men suffering as much as the poor Africans. Another London MP, presenting a petition against abolition, thought that ending the slave trade was 'repugnant to every principle of humanity, of justice, of common sense, and of reason.'' With one mild reservation, this is an excellent comprehensive study, containing anecdotal gems which make the book a pleasure to read. The reservation is its seemingly unfocused intellectual framework.</p>

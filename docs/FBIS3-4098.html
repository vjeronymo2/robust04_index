			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Circular of the former Ministry of Foreign Economic </F> Relations and Trade (MOFERT) on Strengthening Management Over  Trademarks in the Purchase of Export Commmodities -- released by  the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC),  5 October 1993"]    [Text] When purchasing goods from production enterprises,  the negligence of some foreign trade companies in investigating  the validity of the use of trademarks has resulted in trademark  violations. In order to strengthen management in this field,  the following points are defined:    First, when foreign trade companies purchase goods from  production enterprises for export (or for sale on commission),  they should strictly examine whether the trademark is registered  and belongs to that enterprise. Goods produced by enterprises  that misuse the trademarks of others must not be purchased for  export (or sold on commission).    Second, foreign trade companies may not purchase (or sell on  commission) export goods from production enterprises that use  trademarks licensed to a registered enterprise that has not  stipulated clearly in its contract that the production  enterprise has the right to sell or has only the right to sell  on the domestic market.    Third, without the approval of the foreign trade company  that  holds the trademark, export enterprises may not purchase (or  sell on commission) export goods from enterprises with a  domestically registered trademark that, for historical reasons,  is possessed by a foreign trade company -- in addition to the  production enterprise -- and is registered abroad by the foreign  trade company.    Fourth, foreign trade enterprises may not misuse the  trademarks of others to export their goods.    Fifth, when a trademark-holding foreign trade company  endorses the use of its registered trademark by production  enterprises, it should strictly stipulate in the contract the  terms governing the sale of products abroad, and should  strengthen management and supervision.    When purchasing goods for export (or sale on commission), if  a foreign trade company infringes upon the rights of another  party owing to its negligence of trademark ownership or to  improper management by the trademark holder, the party concerned  is to undertake administrative and legal responsibility in light  of the seriousness of the case.

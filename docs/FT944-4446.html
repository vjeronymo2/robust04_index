			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Book Review: Divided by philosophy, not practice LOOKING AT THE SUN By James Fallows Pantheon, Dollars 25, 517 pages Just as looking at the sun causes blindness, so gazing at Asia's fast- emerging economic and social systems can dazzle the mind. James Fallows, Washington editor of the Atlantic Monthly, comes to the rescue, by holding up a polarising filter, through which one clear message can be seen. The main secret of success in the Japanese economy is the country's ability to apply a judicious mixture of government intervention and the free market, he argues. The government picks targets; the market selects the winners to achieve those targets. Add to that the Asian respect for wider collective interests over individual freedom - only visible in western democracies during times of war - and you have an unbeatable recipe. Such theories make Fallows a leading proponent of revisionism, the school of thought that holds that Japan is so different from the west that foreign pressure is the only way to bring change. For that reason, Looking at the Sun is unpopular in Japan - in the mistaken belief that it is anti-Japanese. In fact, Fallows goes out of his way to argue that the west would do well to follow the example of some of Japan's Asian neighbours in adapting some of the strengths of Japanese capitalism to their own systems. The weakness of this book is not that it is anti-Japanese, but too pro-Japanese in paying so little attention to the way in which recent political and economic upheavals have exposed weaknesses in the system. Japan's model is not as mysterious or unfair as many free-market minded critics, especially the US government, believe, argues Fallows. America's own economic power was born from its ability to violate the principle of laisser-faire. The federal government used high import duties to protect the domestic steel industry in the 19th century and did not start espousing free markets until after it had become strong, in the 1940s. Britain and Germany followed similar patterns. Japan is only following the west's well-tried path, for example, by forcing foreign electronic companies in the 1960s and 1970s to license semiconductor chip technology to Japanese, as a condition of doing business in Japan. That laid the base from which Japan grew to dominate the world chip market by 1990. This does not mean that the US should try to adopt the Japanese model wholesale, says Fallows. Rather, it should think back to the strategies that helped it succeed in the first place. Despite the rise of multilateral trading rules, the world economy still turns on the battle between the weak and strong, leaders and followers, rather than on the fair and unfair, he argues. What makes the strong succeed? Japan and its most successful neighbours have little time for the philosophy of competition between individuals, as advocated by economist Joseph Schumpeter and seen as one of the great assets of the US. Rather, they follow Friedrich List, the 19th-century German economist, who believes that a nation's wealth depends on its skill at producing, rather than consuming, and that individual wealth is therefore dependent on that of the group. It is no accident, argues Fallows, that List is little known in the US and popular in Tokyo and Seoul. Japan's List-like ideas set the tone of the rest of Asia's economic development, just as Japanese government assistance, commercial lending, technology and industrial power, set the pace. But beware of thinking of east Asian countries as like-minded planets of the Japanese sun. Fallows divides Japan's neighbours into four sets. First, there are countries experiencing growth without development, such as Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. Their economies are primarily objects of Japan's dynamism, as cheap assembly sites and fast growing markets for Japanese goods. They are driven by forces beyond their control, unable to steer their own economic destinies. They are almost economic colonies of Japan. Second come countries on the sidelines, such as Burma, North Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, which have missed out on the region's growth through bad leadership, natural disaster or bad luck. They could well prosper in the future, but for the time being are left in the shade. Third are the contenders, whose systems closely resemble Japan's - South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. They could catch up with Japan, in the sense of developing independent technology, commercial and political leverage, though they could never surpass Japan in size, predicts Fallows. The final category is the wild card, China. It could either come, within 50 years or so, to dominate east Asian economies more completely than Japan does now, or it could stagnate indefinitely. Either way, the economic future of Hong Kong and Taiwan will be increasingly bound to China. Above all, one thing will determine the chances of success of Asia's different categories of player. That will be their governments' ability to borrow Japanese-style industrial and trade policy to build up the productive base of their economies. Here, Fallows has no truck with Washington's present line that Asian countries should adopt western-style free markets, and that their governments should intervene as little as possible. He advocates, instead, the European Union strategy that the state's job is to set rules that best serve broad economic interests. One example is local content requirements, which put pressure on Japanese manufacturers to build plants in Europe in the 1980s. The Europeans interfered with the free market, yet ended up expanding world trade. Japan and Asia are not as different from the west as they look.</p>

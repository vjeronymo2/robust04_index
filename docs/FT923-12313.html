			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / International Company News: Near Pounds 6m downturn pushes Jacques Vert Pounds 2.8m into red AS FORECAST in May, Jacques Vert has tumbled from profits of Pounds 3.01m to pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.81m in the year to April 25 after the costs incurred from its reversion to its profitable core. The womens wear group, which is about 59 per cent owned by its joint chairmen, is passing its final dividend, which leaves the 2p interim as the total. Last year's it paid 10p for the full year. The factory at Upton, Yorkshire, had been closed after a drawn-out wrangle with the local council, which planned an open-cast coal mine next to it. Closure and redundancy costs accounted for about half of the Pounds 1.75m exceptional charges. The balance was for stock provisions, of which Pounds 690,000 related to continuing operations. The Alain Cannelle leisure wear label was discontinued and its associated warehouse in Harlow closed, as were the group's three loss-making outlets in the US. These moves resulted in extraordinary costs of Pounds 1.84m. In all, the restructure involved a 20 per cent reduction in the workforce to 750. Mr Alan Green, joint chairman, said: 'The past is the past; we can now concentrate on the future.' He was keen to point out that continuing operations - essentially the Jacques Vert and JV Plus brands - made profits of Pounds 1.02m before the exceptional stock provisions. The Grace collection will launch soon and the joint venture with the Ben de Lisi label was making progress, said Mr Green. So far, none of the Upton production had been switched either to the Washington, Tyne and Wear, or to the Newton Abbot, Devon, factories, he said. At least in the short term some was being sourced in eastern Europe and Portugal. Mr Malcolm Heald, who replaced Mr Sashi Mylvaganam as finance director this year, said that borrowings had edged up to Pounds 6.1m (Pounds 5.9m), but that gearing climbed more steeply from 51 to 79 per cent. He said the company would reduce its debt with profits. Turnover fell from Pounds 42.9m to Pounds 40.9m, or to Pounds 38.9m for continuing operations, and losses per share were 21.27p (earnings 21.86p).</p>

"I admit that I am really afraid of the future. This stems  from the fact that a great number of UN conventions have been in  force for thirty years, but the drug-related crime has not  decreased, rather the contrary. I am concerned by the statement  of director-general of the Interpol that the struggle against  illegal drug trafficking has failed and legalisation of drugs is  a possible solution for the future," Ruml noted.    He described his election as deputy chairman of the  conference as an expression of the Czech Republic's effort to  contribute to the struggle against the drug danger, Ruml said.    The conference was staged by the expert organisation for  cooperation of the struggle against drug abuse and drug  trafficking within the European Council which is known as the  Pompidou Group.</p>

			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> IGLESIAS SUED OVER SONG CREDIT  </P> <P> A Miami woman is suing Julio Iglesias on the grounds that he defrauded her of  royalties from a song they wrote together.  </P> <P> Grecia (Mimi) Korman wants $50,000 in damages, plus interest, court costs and  attorney fees.  </P> <P> Korman says that in 1978 Iglesias asked her to help write a Spanish adaptation  of the French song "J'ai Oublie de Vivre" ("I've Forgotten to Live"). She says  she worked with some of his preliminary lyrics and a month later presented him  with a finished product.  </P> <P> The song appeared on at least seven albums with Korman and Iglesias listed as  co-writers, but Korman says Iglesias entered into a contract with the French  publishers of the song, presenting himself as the sole writer.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Mayor Bradley is out and Police Chief Darryl Gates is in for a cameo part in an  upcoming "Hunter" segment on NBC. With Bradley involved in the mayoral  campaign, his appearance would necessitate equal time for other candidates.  Though Gates has already filmed the role, NBC faces a similar equal time  situation should he decide to run for governor. The role: a police chief  delivering a message about cracking down on crime.

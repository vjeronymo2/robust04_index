			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Apr 20, BNS -- Albinas Januska, Lithuanian  deputy foreign minister, and Per Gullik Stavnum, Norway's  ambassador to Lithuania, on Wednesday [20 April] signed a  protocol on agreements regulating relations between the two  countries.    The protocol annulled a 1923 agreement on trade and  navigation and a reciprocal agreement on exempting automobiles  and other motor vehicles from road taxes, the Lithuanian  Ministry said.    The two pre-war agreements were replaced by a free trade  agreement and an agreement on international transportation by  road.    A ministry official said the protocol eliminated certain  legal problems because both pre-war and newly signed agreements  were considered effective.</p>

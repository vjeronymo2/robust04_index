			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Bonds undermine foundations - Greycoat's future after the PosTel rejection CHRONICLERS of the demise of Greycoat, one of UK's most adventurous 1980s property companies, will have to wait a while longer before bringing their final chapter to a close. Yesterday, the Pounds 121m rescue bid put together by PosTel, the UK's largest pension fund, failed to receive adequate support from two classes of bond and shareholders. But one way or the other, Greycoat's days seem numbered. From the moment PosTel published its complex offer document in July, the company was in breach of covenants restricting gearing. If the board's dire warnings to shareholders ahead of yesterday's vote are to be believed, this means Greycoat could be facing the imminent arrival of the liquidators. Such an event would be an ignominious ending for one of the most exciting of the 1980s property developers. Its main developments at 123 Buckingham Palace Road, Britannic House, and Embankment Place, the imposing office building above London's Charing Cross railway station, have been received with the highest critical acclaim from architects and property investors. Where Greycoat suffered, along with Stanhope and Rosehaugh two other 1980s developers that have already gone under, was from the severity of the slump in commercial property. Had property values recovered earlier, Greycoat could have been able to meet the looming demands that have brought the company to the brink. Without that recovery in values, survival has proved impossible. It was the financing of Embankment Place that was the immediate cause of Greycoat's problems. To meet the Pounds 160m capital cost, Greycoat was forced to top up borrowings with a Pounds 21m bond on which it paid no coupon. The bondholders expected to be repaid Pounds 50m in 1995, which would have been possible had the property slump not persisted so long. Then there is Britannic House, the prestigious building which houses BP and the asset best suited for institutional investors now seeking to rebuild property portfolios. Again Greycoat deferred some of the pain by paying a low initial coupon, which is now about to double. Realistically, the company has no chance of meeting these commitments. As Mr Geoffrey Wilson, Greycoat's chairman, said yesterday, the company remains in default after yesterday's rejection of the PosTel deal. However liquidation may not be inevitable. Even if it does come to that it may not be as bleak as Greycoat has claimed in the run-up to the votes. As Greycoat's directors licked their wounds, presumably with NM Rothschild, their advisers, who it was revealed yesterday were on a substantial success related fee, speculation rose that another bidder might now show its hand. Throughout PosTel's protracted offer period no other buyers emerged. It is possible they did not want to take on such a large institution. In addition, if some property analysts and the dissenting Greycoat preference shareholders are to be believed, the company's value may have risen since it was correctly valued by PosTel when it first proposed the deal six months ago. Mr John Katz, a vociferous critic of the deal and a preference shareholder, has strongly questioned the valuation of properties which are at present occupied by tenants enjoying rent free holidays. This has become a common incentive during the property slump but it clearly has reduced the value of the properties, he says. In a couple of years there would be a considerable increase in the cash flow from these properties, making them very attractive to long-term investors. Whether this view of valuations proves correct is for the market to decide. One way or another, either through another bid or the services of a liquidator, the hypothesis on which the bond and preference shareholders based their rejection of the PosTel offer will be tested very soon.</p>

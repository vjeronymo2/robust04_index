			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Ozdem </F> Sanberk by Tahir Yilmaz in Ankara on 26 June -- recorded]    [Text] [Yilmaz] Sir, after your contacts in the United  States, you flew to Baghdad. What is the latest situation?    [Sanberk] We went there to bring closer together the basis  of the UN Security Council resolutions and the common ground  established during our previous visit to Baghdad. This time,  the Iraqi officials, mainly Tariq 'Aziz, moved closer toward  certain points of the general framework drawn up by the United  Nations. In other words, we were able to bring the issue inside  that framework as much as possible.    There were two main problems: One was the need to make a  contribution to the UN compensation fund; the second was the  trust fund. This time, the Iraqi officials declared that they  agree to contribute to both funds. In this way, two important  difficulties were overcome. Preparations will now be made in  New York for a draft resolution.    [Yilmaz] Can you tell us when the pipeline will be flushed?    [Sanberk] It would be wrong to give a date, because it may  not happen on that date. We believe it will happen within a  short period of time, because the major difficulties have been  overcome. Do not forget that all the difficulties, however, have  not been overcome yet. It may take one month; it may take more.  It is impossible to say at this time.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Colonial Puppet Regime Clinging To Sleeves of U.S. </F> Troops"-- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN in a  by-lined article today brands the South Korean "regime" which is  prolonging its days in reliance on outside forces as a colonial  puppet regime right down to its toes.    This is fully illustrated by the attitude of the puppets  toward the U.S. Forces in South Korea, the article says, and  goes on:    Now countries and nations all over the world are lifting up  loud voices demanding the dismantling of the U.S. military bases  in their territories. But only the South Korean puppets are  running the gamut of folly, entreating for the permanent  occupation of South Korea by the U.S. Forces and "protection by  the nuclear umbrella".    When the anti-American sentiments ran high in South Korea,  the United States said it would withdraw its forces from South  Korea in order to lull them. If the South Korean puppets had an  iota of national conscience, they should have welcomed its  intention to take back its aggression forces to their den across  the ocean. They, however, entreated the United States not to  withdraw its forces from South Korea and even staged the drama  of "a cabinet resignation en bloc."    They pay a colossal amount of fund for the maintenance of  the  U.S. forces. The United States pays the rent to the countries  where its aggression troops are stationed for the use of bases.  However, it does not pay a penny for many military bases in  South Korea but uses them free of charge and receives billions  of dollars from the puppets every year in burden sharing.    To justify this mean act the South Korean puppets talk  volubly about "protection by the nuclear umbrella". But it is  an outburst which can be let out only by those obsessed with  flunkeyist treacheries. The Kim Yong-sam traitor clique is  meaner than any other preceding rulers in serving the U.S.  master. Promising a larger burden share than the preceding  "regimes", the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique entreated the U.S. to  permanently leave its forces in South Korea and made it shelve  the "U.S. troop cutback plan".    They are trying to keep the aggression forces in South Korea  at any cost and slay the fellow countrymen in the North with  their help. But this is a foolish act of tightening the noose  around their own neck.    How can they be safe, the traitors who pay to the master the  expenses for the maintenance of the aggression forces by empting  the pockets of the people, imploring them to slay fellow  countrymen, while leaving the land and the people under their  jackboots query.    The colonial puppet regime dependent on the United States,  which has no sovereignty, will meet its doom, rejected by the  people.</p>

			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PAINFUL IRONY OF MELLENCAMP;  </P> <P> ROCK'S CHAMPION OF SMALL-TOWN VALUES TURNS ON HIMSELF  </P> <P> It is unusual for a recording artist to begin an interview by mentioning  someone else's music, especially when he's got his own new album to promote.  But this is an unusual time for John Cougar Mellencamp.  </P> <P> "I just made a record with a kid named James McMurtry," the 37-year-old rock  singer said even before the first question was asked in a Beverly Hills hotel.  McMurtry is the son of novelist Larry McMurtry, a long-time friend of  Mellencamp.  </P> <P> "And you've got to understand that the last thing I want to do is go into the  studio and work on someone else's record. But this kid is such a wonderful  writer. He's just 25, but he writes like he's 50 . . . like he's seen so much."  </P> <P> Without prompting, Mellencamp (who co-produced the McMurtry album, due this  summer) described one of the young writer's songs.  </P> <P> "You heard my new record? Well, there's a song on James' album -- 'Song for a  Deckhand's Daughter' -- that makes 'Jackie Brown' sound like a joke," he said,  dismissing a cut on his own LP. "It's so touching. It's about a woman who loves  someone regardless of what a (jerk) he is.  </P> <P> "In the song, this guy is out mowing the grass one summer and he just heads  down the road. The song goes, 'Came back at Christmas, never said where he had  been, just presents for the children, just stories for the men.' "  </P> <P> A few minutes later, Mellencamp -- still raving about McMurtry -- was  interrupted by a knock at the door. An assistant handed Mellencamp a package  filled with photographs of his own paintings. He thumbed through them as he  returned to his chair.  </P> <P> "Here's how I've been spending my time recently: painting," the singer said  enthusiastically, holding up a favorite photo. "It is so satisfying. My mom  used to paint when I was a kid, but she used to take forever to finish a  painting because she also had to raise us kids.  </P> <P> "But I found it's just like songwriting. . . . Sometimes it takes weeks to  write a song, then other times it just pours out. I've done 80 paintings since  August."  </P> <P> If you get the feeling Mellencamp's mind isn't solely on his own music these  days, you're right.  </P> <P> He's at the peak of his career in terms of critical and commercial success --  his last four albums have sold an estimated 14 million copies worldwide. But  Mellencamp appears disenchanted with much of the rock world.  </P> <P> In some ways, it's the old story of chasing success for years, only to find  that the money and fame don't bring you happiness.  </P> <P> Some of Mellencamp's mood may be burnout. He's one of rock's most celebrated  performers, but he doesn't like touring, and those nearly 150 concerts last  year took their toll.  </P> <P> Yet Mellencamp is also unusually introspective, and his malaise apparently goes  deeper than the usual complaints about the hectic pace on the pop  merry-go-round.  </P> <P> After championing traditional values and small-town life in his recent albums,  Mellencamp finds himself, uncomfortably, battling aspects of his own behavior  -- tendencies such as selfishness and infidelity that are aggravated by all the  hero worship surrounding rock stars.  </P> <P> In the angry, self-mocking "Big Daddy," the title track of his new album, you  can feel Mellencamp wrestling with his own emotions.  </P> <P>  You used to chase your women right into your home  </P> <P>  You used to tell them you love them over the telephone  </P> <P>  Now they all see through you and you're sinking like a stone.  </P> <P>  No one's knocking at your door  </P> <P>  No one calls  </P> <P>  How does it feel to be the big daddy of them all?  </P> <P>  About the song, Mellencamp said: "Being a big daddy doesn't mean you have to  be rich and famous. There's a little bit of big daddy in everybody, whether  you're the head of the kitchen at the restaurant or the head of a big record  company.  </P> <P> "When I first started writing that song, I thought I was writing about that  part of everyone, but I eventually realized I was writing the song about myself  because if you're a rock star, it's real easy to take advantage of people by  being a big daddy 24 hours a day."  </P> <P> If there is any anger in the lines of "Big Daddy," there is a sadness in "Void  in My Heart" that mirrors equally Mellencamp's state these days:  </P> <P>  Been a parent, had three children  </P> <P>  And a big house on the hill  </P> <P>  Hundred dollars in my pocket  </P> <P>  And it didn't buy a thing  </P> <P>  Now there's a void in my heart  </P> <P>  And a hole in my dream.  </P> <P>  Mellencamp still lives in Bloomington, Ind., 45 miles from where he was born  in Seymour. He sees his second wife, Vicky, and their three daughters almost  every day, he said, even though they have been separated for nearly two years.  He lives alone behind the imposing walls of a two-story home on the edge of  town.  </P> <P> The rock star's separation was recently splashed all over the pages of the  National Enquirer, which suggested that he was a womanizer. He frowned when the  story was mentioned, but he acknowledged he has to work on certain areas of his  character.  </P> <P> "There is still somewhere in the back of my mind that little boy out behind the  barn smoking a cigarette trying to get away with something," Mellencamp said.  </P> <P> "I've got to deal with that or I'm going to end up . . . like the song says. .  . . Being the big daddy of them all, . . . being 70 years old and just  floating, . . . not being committed to anything or anybody except yourself, and  that scares me."  </P> <P> It's ironic that Mellencamp is down on himself at a time when he has convinced  once-doubting critics that he deserves a leadership role in rock.  </P> <P> There was a time when "arrogant," "obnoxious" and "derivative" were the words  most frequently applied to him by critics and other industry observers. Even  after he broke into the Top 10 in 1981 with such hits as "Jack and Diane" and  "Hurt So Good," Mellencamp was frequently branded shallow and contrived.  </P> <P> The critical breakthrough for Mellencamp began in 1983 with "Pink Houses," an  ironic, bittersweet look at the state of the American Dream. His "Scarecrow"  album in 1985 also signaled an increased maturity. Despite some minor moments,  the album touched on a warmer, personal, socially-conscious tone.  </P> <P> Mellencamp gained more new admirers with 1987's "The Lonesome Jubilee," an  album that had an even more original "heartland rock" tone. Along with such  other veteran artists as Bruce Springsteen, Don Henley and Bob Seger, he seemed  to be addressing an older rock audience: his contemporaries.  </P> <P> "Lonesome Jubilee," he said at the time, was about a generation whose dreams  haven't come true, but that shouldn't mean the end of those dreams. "We can  waste our time by saying, 'Damn it, I should have done this or I should have  done that,' but it's all a shallow exercise unless you do more," he said. "To  me, rock 'n' roll was always about tonight. . . . Have a good time. But it was  also about tomorrow, . . . the idea of doing something with your life."  </P> <P> Instead of reflecting on the world around him, Mellencamp seems to be looking  inward on the "Big Daddy" album.  </P> <P> "I don't like to listen to a song like 'Big Daddy,' " Mellencamp said. "When I  first played the song to a couple of guys in the band, they just kind of went,  'Do you really want to make this record?' They knew exactly whom I was talking  about."  </P> <P> Rather than go on tour in support of his new album, Mellencamp is going to  spend time working on his painting and thinking about his future. He's planning  to drive around the country, taking photographs for future paintings. That's a  dramatic move in an industry where touring is considered a key to selling an  album.  </P> <P> "I really understand what John Lennon meant when he said 'I'm not in this race  anymore,' " Mellencamp said. "Ten years ago, they were words, but I relate to  them now. It's how I feel.  </P> <P> "It's not important for me to be in this magazine or that magazine. The  important thing is getting my life together and that's what I'm concentrating  on. I followed the rock 'n' roll dream for a long time and it has given me a  lot of rewards, but it also distracted me from the things I need to work on . .  . in my own life. I think it's time now to start paying attention to them."  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POWERS DECIDED TO 'MAKE DOCTORS PAY,' COURT TOLD  </P> <P> Bradford Warren Powers Jr. told police that he decided to "take the law into  his own hands and make the doctors pay" for his father's death when he  allegedly shot four people in a rampage at Mission Bay Memorial Hospital, a  prosecutor said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Eichler made that assertion in a brief San Diego  Municipal Court hearing in which Powers pleaded not guilty to two counts of  murder and three counts of attempted murder.  </P> <P> His eyes moist and bloodshot, the 46-year-old La Jolla man spoke only once to  the judge, when he interrupted the hearing and said, "I don't wish for bail."  </P> <P> Judge William Woodward set bail at $2.5 million, despite Eichler's request that  Powers be held without bail. The prosecutor had argued that Powers had planned  to flee to Oregon before he turned himself in to Oceanside police an hour after  he allegedly opened fire in an emergency room last Saturday.  </P> <P> The spray of bullets killed a nurse and a student trainee -- on his first day  at the job -- and wounded the on-duty physician and the father of a patient.  </P> <P> The shootings occurred about eight hours after Brad Powers Sr. died in the same  emergency room, suffering a heart attack while doctors were attempting to  repair a ruptured abdominal aneurysm.  </P> <P> Authorities alleged that the younger Powers, who has had psychiatric problems  dating back at least 25 years, was distraught over the death of his father, a  well-known architectural illustrator, and returned to the scene to seek  revenge.  </P> <P> In the days since the shootings, a dark side to the father-son relationship has  emerged. The younger Powers, who lived at home and seldom held a job for more  than several months, was occasionally physically and verbally abusive to his  father, a doctor and a family attorney said in telephone interviews.  </P> <P> At the request of a family member, the coroner's office investigated whether  physical abuse had contributed to the elder Powers' death, said Dr. H. E.  Hammerstead, who tried to save the aging man when he was brought into the  emergency room. The coroner's investigation, however, found no signs of  physical abuse, he said.  </P></p>

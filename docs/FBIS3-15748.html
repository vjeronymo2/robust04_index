			<p>Language: <F P=105>Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The mediatory efforts and diplomatic exchanges on a  settlement of the Karabakh conflict have again intensified. It  could be stated that the new efforts to find a settlement within  the CSCE framework, particularly Minsk Group Chairman Jan  Eliasson's visit to Moscow and to this region, were to a certain  extent prompted by the latest Russian initiative.    The news conference held today by Armenian First Deputy  Foreign Minister Zhirair Liparityan was devoted to these  developments and to his latest visits to Paris, Ankara, and  Tehran.    In summing up all these developments, Mr. Liparityan noted  that regrettably the CSCE's efforts have so far produced no  results. He assessed Jan Eliasson's efforts as a serious  attempt to revive that mediatory mission.    Mr. Liparityan then set out Armenia's position for the  settlement of the problem. He said that at present priority is  being given to the establishment of the cease-fire, which is  impossible to achieve without separating the forces. And  finally, the international mediatory efforts should be brought  together and harmonized. This was in reference to the mediatory  efforts of Russia and the CSCE. The international community must  present to the conflicting sides one single plan which, besides  the cease-fire issue, should spell out all those possible steps  that would create an atmosphere of mutual confidence and allow  talks to resume on the basic problem. Zhirair Liparityan  considers these steps to be: The withdrawal of troops from  certain territories, the lifting of the blockades, and finally  an agreement to resolve the status of Nagorno-Karabakh at the  Minsk conference.    Zhirair Liparityan said: We have presented this approach not  only to Mr. Eliasson but also to Paris, Ankara, and Tehran.  But, I reiterate that the highest priority is the establishment  of a cease- fire.</p>

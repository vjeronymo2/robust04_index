			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (6): Meaner and fitter after the recession - After a heavy battering, the surviving wholesalers show they still have a role to play PREDICTIONS that the expanding global networks of leading express companies and activities by airlines would squeeze out independent wholesalers are proving wide of the mark. There were a number of significant casualties in the wholesale sector in the late 1980s but surviving wholesalers are now generally expanding. In line with the overall trend towards greater co-operation in the express and air transport industries, they are increasingly developing partnerships with airlines to sustain that expansion. Mr Larry Woelk, managing director of John Menzies Group wholesale express company Menzies Worldwide Distribution (MWD), believes that sort of co-operation is the way ahead for independent wholesalers during the 1990s. 'Airlines are increasingly looking to focus on their core business - flying aircraft. An airline can do a deal with us and because we are a wholesaler, we can service the entire agent community,' he claims. Wholesalers work on behalf of a wide range of freight industry companies - from traditional forwarders with a requirement for someone to handle their more urgent package traffic to established courier/express operators seeking a neutral organisation to cover routes where they lack the traffic volumes or presence to handle everything themselves. Wholesalers tend to fall into one of two categories. The first involves independent companies like MWD which specialise in that particular business. Another is International Bonded Couriers (IBC), a US-based company with a European office in London which specialises in handling traffic for Latin America. The second group involves operations developed by some of the larger international airlines. British Airways, for instance, has an organisation called Speedbird Courier which has built up a worldwide network of wholesale courier services. British Midland operates similar services within Europe and also has a separate wholesale division for worldwide shipments called International Cargo Marketing. Air France recently consolidated all its express products under one generic name - Air France Express - to highlight its renewed focus on wholesale operations. It was that sort of involvement by leading airlines which led to suggestions that the days of the independent wholesale express company might be numbered. However, many airlines have struggled to develop successful express operations and there is a pronounced trend for many to work with outside wholesalers. For example, the three-year-old wholesale courier/express company Bridges Worldwide already has close links with a number of leading longhaul airlines. The company initially launched services between London, Singapore and Sydney with Singapore Airlines and is now UK agent for that airline's courier products. Bridges also works with South African Airways for services into Southern Africa, Gulf Air for the Middle East Gulf and Virgin Atlantic Airways for the US and Tokyo, Japan markets. In the case of Virgin, Bridges is the airline's general handling agent for express products worldwide. 'We work very closely with Virgin and we help them to develop their express products,' comments Mr Gary Kendall, general manager for Bridges Worldwide. 'All the airlines we work with can take advantage of our worldwide network - for example, we get traffic coming in from India on one carrier which is then transferred on to Virgin flights for onward movement to the US.' Meanwhile, US carrier United Airlines has over the last year developed a wholesale airport-to-door service between the UK and the US in conjunction with MWD. Similar services are now being developed out of Spain, Belgium and France. MWD says it is also talking to 'a couple of other international airlines' about developments similar to its partnership with the US carrier. Within Europe, the advent of the EC single market is expected to boost regional air courier wholesale operations. Specifically, the business should benefit from a reduced need for on-board couriers to accompany shipments and lodge documentation with Customs authorities. Mr John Wilson, marketing manager express products for British Airways World Cargo, pointed out that up to the beginning of this year, the carrier's Speedbird organisation used couriers for all European services. Now, he says, it is beginning to dispense with them on some routes out of London, starting with those to Germany and Belgium, and is also planning to increase the frequency of services. Apart from London, the only other UK airport with international Speedbird Courier services at present is Birmingham which has routes to Milan and Brussels. 'In future, we will be looking to open up direct services from places like Glasgow and Manchester to the Continent and also, further down the road, to start bringing in Continental regional airports,' he added. British Midland is taking a similar path. The airline has already dispensed with on-board couriers for its wholesale services between London and Dublin, Frankfurt, Brussels, Amsterdam and Paris. It is launching new direct courier services between points such as Belfast and Amsterdam, Glasgow and Paris and Birmingham and Brussels. 'This month we are also introducing a new product, a sameday priority wholesale courier service from UK regional points like Glasgow, Edinburgh, Belfast, Teesside and Birmingham to the Continental centres we cover, via a transfer at London Heathrow,' British Midland added. However, some general European wholesale courier/express service development is still being slowed down by continuing differences in the way individual EC Customs authorities treat courier shipments. The UK Customs, for example, now allow airlines to send EC-bound courier traffic without an on-board courier, as are their counterparts in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. Customs in France and Italy, though, are currently not prepared to make that concession for services which carry worldwide shipments in transit as well as items moving solely within the EC. 'If you take our London-Frankfurt route, for example, that carries both UK-originating traffic and also traffic which has originated in New York and been transshipped in London for onward movement to Germany,' pointed out Mr Wilson. 'So for the moment, we are going to have to retain on-board couriers on certain flights to cater for that international traffic.' On-board courier service customers hoping that the reduced need for someone personally to accompany EC traffic will cut costs are also likely to be disappointed. Any savings on costs through not using couriers will be counter-balanced by additional ground-handling service and systems costs, warn wholesale courier service operators.</p>

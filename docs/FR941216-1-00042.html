			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (D)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Special rule for contingent payments substantially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar to options.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A right to a contingent payment that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantially similar to an option or combination of options, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is not otherwise a quotable contingent payment, is treated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a quotable contingent payment if spot price quotations for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option or options are readily available. The projected amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the contingent payment is the spot price of the option or options  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the issue date compounded at the applicable Federal rate for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the debt instrument (within the meaning of &sect;1.1274&hyph;4(b)) from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue date to the date the payment is due.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reasonable determination of projected amounts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projected amounts of quotable contingent payments may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined based on either the bid, ask, or midpoint price quotes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the substantially similar property rights, provided the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination is reasonable and is made on a consistent basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If price quotations vary among different quotation sources, any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable quotation may be used. If a right to a contingent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment is substantially similar to more than one combination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> property rights for which forward price quotes are readily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available (or options for which spot prices are readily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available), any reasonable combination may be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Quotes not readily available.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a debt instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides for one or more contingent payments that are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section (nonquotable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contingent payments), the projected amount of each contingent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment on the debt instrument is determined as follows. First,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the projected amount of each quotable contingent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section. Second,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the projected yield of the debt instrument. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projected yield is a reasonable rate for the debt instrument. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable rate is a rate that, as of the issue date, reflects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general market conditions, the credit quality of the issuer, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the terms and conditions of the debt instrument (e.g., the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existence of collateral securing the debt instrument or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncertainty inherent in the contingent payments). A reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate is never less than, and may substantially exceed, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable Federal rate for the debt instrument (within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meaning of &sect;1.1274&hyph;4(b)), and may not be less than the yield on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the debt instrument based on the projected payment schedule set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without regard to the nonquotable contingent payments. Third,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> select a projected amount for each nonquotable contingent payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> so that the projected payment schedule results in the projected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> yield and reasonably reflects the relative expected values of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonquotable contingent payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

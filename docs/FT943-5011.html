			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Cantors improves towards end of year Cantors, the retail furnishing group, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.54m for the year to April 23, a 52 per cent increase on the comparable Pounds 1.67m. Turnover rose 3 per cent from Pounds 60.4m to Pounds 62m. Mr Harold Cantor, chairman, said the January sale was successful and there was an improvement in trading in the last quarter of the year. This continued into the first month of the present year but the tax rises and the hot weather in June and July resulted in very poor trading. Earnings per share came out at 10.33p (6.66p) and the dividend is being maintained at 4p with an unchanged final of 3p.</p>

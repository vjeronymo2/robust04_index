			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEAR OF TROUBLE CANCELS MEXICAN CELEBRATION  </P> <P> In response to a melee that marred this year's Cinco de Mayo celebration at  Lincoln Park, Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre said Monday that the  traditional Mexican Independence Day observance, scheduled for Sept. 16 at the  park, has been canceled.  </P> <P> The Eastside councilman said he made the decision after determining that the  city policy of allowing beer sales at such events needs further study.  </P> <P> "Rather than make a hasty decision on a long-term policy, I have decided to  cancel the event at Lincoln Park," he said.  </P> <P> "But it is my intention to have both the Cinco de Mayo and Mexican Independence  Day celebrations at the park next year."  </P> <P> Alatorre added that a scaled-down celebration, featuring music and food booths,  would be staged at City Hall in conjunction with this year's traditional El  Grito ceremony hosted by the mayor.  </P> <P> Details of the event, which traditionally takes place on the night before the  Sept. 16 holiday, may be released next week, he said.  </P> <P> Critics have charged over the years that the consumption of beer at Mexican  observances, allowed by the city because beer companies underwrite the  festivities, have changed the focus and tenor of such holidays. Events to  promote ethnic pride have turned into glorified beer busts, they contend.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mounting Criticism  </P> <P> The Lincoln Park observances have become a major part of the Southland's  celebration of Mexican holidays, but criticism has mounted since more than 150  police officers were called in to quell a disturbance that cut short the May 5  celebration that attracted more than 30,000 people. One man was shot in the  abdomen and several others were injured when fighting erupted between street  gangs, police said. Six people were arrested.  </P> <P> Alatorre, who was present, said it appeared that the gang members had been  drinking before they arrived. And authorities emphasized that the beer provided  by an Eastside distributor, Miller Brands, did not contribute to the melee.  </P> <P> Alatorre has used his political ties on the Eastside to induce beer  distributors to sponsor events at Lincoln Park and Olvera Street. In exchange,  the distributors were allowed to hoist huge promotional banners at the event.  </P> <P> "There were huge 'Miller' signs at Lincoln Park while we were trying to figure  out why we thought Cinco de Mayo was important," one critic charged.  </P> <P> Joe Sanchez III, owner of the Miller distributorship that supplied the beer  that day, could not be reached for comment Monday.  </P> <P> According to police, the problem is not so much beer consumption as it is the  entertainment. Rock bands attract younger, rowdier crowds and fewer families.  </P> <P> "You need to make the entertainment more family-oriented," said Capt. Art  Lopez, commander of the Hollenbeck Division.  </P> <P> Political connections aside, Alatorre said the policy of allowing beer  consumption needs more study after several meetings with community groups, the  police and other interested parties.  </P> <P> "I really don't think it is the issue, but it's one of the issues we have to  look at," he said.  </P> <P> Other considerations, including entertainment, security and whether such events  should be two-day observances, also need more study, Alatorre said.  </P> <P> Alatorre's decision was quickly praised by the critics.  </P> <P> "I'm glad he has decided to be prudent and cautious," said Lou Negrete,  co-chair of the United Neighborhoods Organization. "It's critical that we  reclaim our parks from the gangs."  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Study Supported  </P> <P> Even though the Lincoln Park Coaches Assn. benefited from the beer sales at  Mexican observances, a spokesman for the group also applauded the decision.  </P> <P> "You can't solve a problem unless you study it correctly," said baseball coach  Ruben Vasquez.  </P> <P> However, there will be no shortage of events to mark Mexico's declaration of  independence from Spain in 1810. Major observances are scheduled at Olvera  Street and at Belvedere Park in East Los Angeles, where beer consumption will  be allowed.  </P></p>

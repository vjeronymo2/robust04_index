			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> 3 DEPUTIES WIN HARASSMENT AWARD  </P> <P> A U.S. District Court jury has awarded $2.7 million to three Santa Clara County  sheriff's deputies who alleged that a male officer demanded sex in exchange for  a favorable work review.  </P> <P> In making the award Friday, the court also ruled that the Sheriff's Department  and several officials did not do enough to discourage the ongoing harassment.  The deputies, Zana Murphy, Cynthia Bates and Toni Daugherty, filed the suit in  1985, charging sheriff's officials with failure to investigate complaints  against Deputy Craig Nelson. The three accused Nelson of making lewd comments  and sexual advances while he was their training officer at the county jail.  </P></p>

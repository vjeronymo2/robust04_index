			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article under the ``Ecology'' rubric by Candidate of </F> Economic Sciences Igor Dubov, President of the `Ekoresurs'  Intersectoral Economic Association: ``Would That I Had  Mountains of Gold and Tax Concessions. More than A Billion  Tonnes of Solid Waste Poisoning the Environment'']    [Text] An inadvertent misprint once revealed surprisingly  accurately the nub of the problem: The words ``ash waste''  [``zoloshlakovyye otkhody''] had been replaced by the words  ``gold waste'' [``zolotoshlakovyye otkhody'']. Indeed, if the  solid waste of thermal electric power stations is divided into  its different elements and projected onto Mendeleyev's table  they would cover it so comprehensively that some gold-bearing  veins might seem a lot poorer. These waste products contain  gold, silver, and such rare metals as germanium, vanadium,  strontium, scandium, and lithium. Around 96 tonnes of gold alone  could be extracted from the waste produced at our thermal  electric power stations!    Prior to 1989, when the problem of recycling ash waste was  under the state's control, the curve showing the volume of  recycling rose constantly, reaching a figure of 16.3 million  tonnes for the USSR as a whole or 15 percent of annual  production (the figure abroad is around 55 percent). This work  was included in our national economic plan and centralized  capital investments were allocated to the development of  reprocessing capacities.    In recent years, however, because of the lack of effective  rules governing market mutual relations, the curve showing the  recycling of ash waste in Russia has begun to steadily decline.  Last year just 3.0 million tonnes or around 7 percent of annual  output was reprocessed. In all there are more than 1 billion  tonnes of solid waste accumulated in waste dumps at thermal  electric power stations, which occupy over 20,000 hectares of  land.    When the discussion turns to state regulation, many people  for some reason take this to mean a return to the old ways, to a  rigid system of planning, to the budget financing of all and  sundry, strict executive discipline, and so forth. State  regulation as we understand it (for the transitional period)  means movement toward full-fledged market relations in which the  system of direct economic benefit works faultlessly. But for  this system to begin operating the state and the local  authorities must adopt the necessary legislative and legal acts.    For example, the corresponding taxation must be used to  practically close off access to natural resources if they can be  replaced by ash waste without causing a deterioration in the  technical characteristics of output. Preferential taxation and  credit can be introduced for enterprises which reprocess those  waste products. State regulation or, more accurately, state  participation would also include an insignificant proportion of  budget financing, which the state would use for scientific  research and experimental design work of a problematic  intersectoral character, and in the sphere of capital investment  for the creation of pilot projects for the reprocessing of major  quantities of these waste products measured in tonnes.  Statistical accounting and the radiation safety of the use of  ash waste must be kept under state patronage, as must other  questions affecting society's interests.    The conclusion is obvious: The problem must be resolved at  federal level and the interests of the components of the  Federation must be taken into account. The ``Ekoresurs''  Intersectoral Economic Association, founded at the end of 1990  by the USSR Energy Ministry, the Moscow City Soviet Executive  Committee, and energy and science-and-production associations,  produced a number of proposals which it put to the government in  August 1992. They formed a basis for the study of the  subprogram ``Reprocessing of thermal electric power station ash  waste products'' within the federal targeted program ``Fuel and  Energy.'' This is where regional and federal interests were  brought together.  If the regional measure envisages the construction of a  reprocessing enterprise with a capacity of over 500,000 cubic  meters of waste a year, it is the opinion of the authors of the  subprogram that it has the right to expect the support of the  federal authorities -- in the form of budget financing or  preferential taxation. Only the urgent creation of multitonne  reprocessing capacities can halt the catastrophic accumulation  of waste products and reduce their negative impact on the  natural environment.    As for economic efficiency, in a cost-based economy where  the  cost price of materials was included in the volumes of work and  affected the fulfillment of the set plan, trying to force the  construction industry to use cheap ash waste materials instead  of costly materials (sand, ballast, or gravel) was virtually  impossible. It is only now, even with only local tax  regulators, that it is possible to implement a policy for the  extensive replacement of natural inert and bonding materials  with ash waste products.    In December 1993 the government approved the draft federal  targeted program ``Fuel and Energy.'' The Russian Ministry of  Fuel and Energy was defined as the state client of the  subprogram ``Processing of thermal electric power station ash  waste products'' with the ``Ekoresurs'' Intersectoral Economic  Association defined as the executor and at the same time its  author. The subprogram does not envisage state dependence. No  more than 15-20 percent of the total volume of expenditure  should be borne by the federal authorities. All the rest is to  come from non-budget funds, first and foremost ecological funds,  from bank credits, and from enterprises' own resources. The  final say in this matter should belong to the Federal Assembly,  which is empowered not only to ratify the indicators in the  subprogram but also to adopt the law ``On solid waste resulting  from production and consumption,'' which Russia urgently needs.</p>

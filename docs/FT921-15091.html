			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (8): Uncertainty constrains performances - Italy / Share prices reflected adverse internal factors and poor economic conditions AS INVESTORS and stockbrokers face up to Italy's 'big bang', now getting under way with the demise of traditional stockbrokers, the birth of securities intermediation firms and the start of continuous screen-based trading, they can derive little satisfaction from the performance of shares listed on the Milan market. Activity has been racked by uncertainty over the past two years. Sentiment has been depressed. Trading volumes have been low and share price indices have reflected a combination of adverse internal factors and poor general economic conditions. It is against this background that Italian representation in the FT500 should be read. At the end of September 1991, Milan's MIB general share index, which is reset to 1,000 at the start of each year, stood at 1,042. However, this modest improvement on the year's beginning was more than wiped out by December, although the drop did not match the mauling that share prices suffered in 1990, with the MIB general index closing at 750 on the last trading day of the year. The MIB performed particularly badly in the second half of 1990. After peaking at 1,113 in mid-June, it fell sharply and gains made in 1988 and 1989 were lost. Capitalisation of shares quoted on the Milan board totalled L168,135bn (Dollars 141bn) at year-end 1990, a drop of 21.9 per cent compared to L215,244bn on December 31, 1989. Share prices had already started to slide when the Gulf crisis broke in August 1990. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait helped the downward movement that started in July when the MIB fell by 3.1 per cent after registering advances in four successive months. The 11.8 per cent drop in August was followed by further falls of between 5 and 6 per cent in each of the next three months, with 1990's low of 725 being touched on 27 November. However, the Gulf crisis was not the only adverse factor affecting the Milan stock market and Italian share prices in 1990 and 1991. Though long expected, the introduction of legislation to tax capital gains also contributed to the depressed tone. 'The taxation of gains arising from equity trading, implemented through a decree law in autumn 1990, was a new disturbance for the Borsa. It led to further reduction in trading levels and encouraged Italian operators to work increasingly on foreign stock markets,' says Attilio Ventura, chairman of the Milan stockbrokers' executive committee. He notes that after a long wait, the market had expected the legislators to produce a much better drafted bill. Leading broker Paolo Azzoni considers that the Gulf crisis and the saga of Italy's capital gains tax were only part of the reason for Milan's poor showing. 'The capital gains tax decree affected trading volumes,' he says, pointing to falls of 14, 11 and 16 per cent that were recorded in September, October and November 1990. 'But prices have been hit more by economic fundamentals. By autumn 1990 many operators were concerned that the Italian economy would not escape recession. Lower dividend earnings were expected. In addition, Italy's situation is aggravated by a budget deficit problem that keeps interest rates high. Monetary policy cannot be eased to alleviate the recession,' comments Mr Azzoni. Already facing a severe set of negative factors, confidence in Milan's stock market was dealt a further blow with the failure of Lombardfin. This led to a week's delay in September 1990's settlement. Earlier that year, the failure of Commissionaria Oggioni had held up March's settlement for 10 days. More recently, the difficulties of two brokers and Commissionaria Misafin caused the August 30, 1991 settlement to slip to September 10. Movements in the prices of leading industrial stocks reflected an increasingly gloomy business climate in 1990 and a worsening in 1991. Turin-based Fiat, Italy's largest private sector corporation, has suffered badly. With more than half of turnover generated by automobile sales and approximately a further quarter from buses, trucks and components, Fiat is vulnerable to downturns in these sectors. A combination of erosion of domestic market share by imported cars and fiercely competitive international markets hit Fiat. Its net revenues from automobiles declined in 1990 and operating profit in this sector slumped by nearly two thirds. With prospects giving no cause for optimism, the price of Fiat ordinary shares fell by more than one half in 1990, dropping from L11,135 to L5,351. At the end of September 1991, Fiat's shares stood at L5,200. Its FT500 ranking has plummeted; from 15th place Fiat falls to 53rd. Office automation equipment maker Olivetti, another prestigious name and industrial blue chip on the Milan board feeling the effects of the worldwide crisis in the computer industry, has suffered an equally sharp setback. Starting 1990 at L7,415, the price of Olivetti ordinary shares lost 57 per cent to finish at L3,220. The decline in 1991 took the price to L2,920 at September 30. Olivetti's place in the FT500 rankings falls from 178 to 375. Olivetti chief Carlo de Benedetti experienced similar disappointments elsewhere in his business empire. The price of shares in Compagnie Industriali Riunite (CIR) crashed from L4,970 to L2,512 in 1990, slipping further to L2,285 at the end of September 1991. CIR's FT500 ranking drops from 207 to 435, while Cofide falls out of the list. Pirelli and Company also left the FT500, having previously been ranked at 363. In common with its sister company and other Italian industrials, shares in Pirelli SpA took a beating in 1990. But Pirelli SpA stays in the rankings, though at 362 it is significantly lower than the previous year's 257. Shares in Italy's financial sector and utilities generally fared somewhat better than industrials, but have nevertheless received harsh treatment. The price of shares in Generali Assicurazioni, the Trieste insurer which is the country's most capitalised corporation and heads Italy's presence in the FT500, started 1990 at L33,151, rose to a maximum of L41,000 and then fell sharply to L27,400 at year-end. The fall continued in 1991, and the price stood at L25,800 at the end of September. Generali slips from 12th place to 24th in the FT500. Performance of bank shares reflected the dull business environment. Shareholders in merchant bank Mediobanca saw the value of their investments decline significantly during 1990, as the price of shares dropped by 28 per cent from L18,500 on the first day of trading to L13,260 at year-end. Though the price recovered to L15,020 at the end of September 1991, Mediobanca's place in the FT500 slips from 73 to 117. Leading retail bank Banca Commerciale Italiana also lost ground and its FT500 ranking drops from 133 to 166. The prices of most quoted companies were down in 1990, and there was little progress in the first nine months of 1991. With the MIB index recording an overall retreat that compares unfavourably with other main European markets, the FT500 consequently registers a decline in the placings of Italian companies. Excluding eight newcomers, only four Italian companies improve their positions, while 22 fall back. How does Italy stand in the rankings? Taking into consideration the seven companies that slipped from the list, its representation remained at 33. Clearly the number of ranked quoted companies remains anomalously small for a leading European country. Italy has no companies in the top 10 and, with Generali Assicurazioni the largest at 24th place, only one in the top 50. In the new rankings only three Italian companies appear in the top 100, against five previously. There were no significant changes over the year, and the features that characterised the Milan stock market and Italy's presence in the FT500 12 months ago remain. With only 220 quoted companies, the Borsa lacks depth. It is also incestuous, with numerous companies interlinked through cross-holdings, and dominated by a few family groups and state-controlled companies. It is estimated that there are several hundred companies whose shares are suitable for quotation. But even where cultural difficulties concerning family ownership and management are overcome, potential newcomers are deterred by the market's volatility and poor reputation. The Borsa is small and, as the FT500 clearly reveals, the companies quoted on it are themselves small when measured against a continental scale. This year's FT500 reflects poor performance of the Milan index relative to share price indices in other European markets. But, beyond this, the rankings show that building globally-sized companies is proving hard for Italian business.</p>

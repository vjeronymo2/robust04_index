			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> CITY BACKS OFF ON MOTOR HOME RULES  </P> <P> About 375 recreational vehicle owners persuaded the City Council on Tuesday to  continue to allow motor homes to be parked in street-side driveways of private  homes.  </P> <P> The city's code enforcement officer had recommended an ordinance to require  recreational vehicles to be parked on driveways at least 14 feet from the  sidewalk.  </P> <P> But after seeing the crowd that showed up, the council instead voted  unanimously to form a commission of residents to study the issue.  </P> <P> Senior code enforcement officer Karen Atkinson said 56 people complained about  motor homes parked in their neighborhoods last year, and nine complained this  year.  </P> <P> Atkinson said those who complained described the vehicles as eyesores.  </P> <P> But recreational vehicle owners complained to the council that they have no  other place to park. Renting space at an RV park costs about $90 a month, and  all local parks have a two-year wait, said Barbara Reott, 60, who built a  driveway at her home for parking her RV.  </P> <P> The panel created by the council will study codes governing recreational  vehicle parking to see whether modifications are warranted.  </P> <P> At least half the panel members will be recreational vehicle owners.

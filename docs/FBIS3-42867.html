			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Miller: "Civil War: Historical Parallels"] </F>   [Text] From time to time we hear these sort of remarks in  the mass media: "Thank God we are not yet in a civil war," or  "The most important task today is to avert a civil war," or  "Russia will not survive another civil war." It is hard to  disagree with all of this. Still, much in this respect remains  unsaid. On one hand, fortunately, our country is indeed  currently not crisscrossed by civil war fronts as it was in  1918-1920. But there also is another side to it. Unfortunately,  armed conflicts are an almost inevitable companion of the  political instability that is inherent in every revolution. And  we do not have the right to close our eyes to armed conflicts in  the Transcaucasus, Central Asia, and other places, which  essentially have one common source--the revolutionary (or  counterrevolutionary, if one looks at it from the position of  left-wing forces) disintegration of the Union.    Associations with the civil war also inevitably come to mind  when one reads reports (I am almost tempted to say summaries of  operations) from the civil war fronts in the former Yugoslavia.  Yes, on the surface it is apparently religious and ethnic  conflicts that are driving it in Croatia, as well as Bosnia and  Herzegovina. It is clear to an attentive observer, however, that  they are developing in the form of a full-scale civil war  resembling in many respects the postrevolution events in Russia.    One of the conclusions that should be drawn in this  connection is that we should abandon the old habit of  classifying as civil war only a clearly defined social armed  conflict. As historical experience tells us, conflicts of other  kinds may acquire the form of a civil war, although in each of  them a social component is undoubtedly present (see on this  also: P. Shevotsukov. "Civil War. A Look Across the Decades."  SVOBODNAYA MYSL, 1992, No. 10; Yu. Polyakov. "A Civil War? An  Interethnic War?" SVOBODNAYA MYSL, 1993, No. 8).    Comparisons between the civil war in Russia and analogous  events on the territory of Yugoslavia also evoke another  thought. With all the differences that form a foundation of  these conflicts, one cannot fail to notice a score of common  features, which modern journalism frequently portrays only as  specific to the civil war in our country. This includes a  horrible bitterness that results in massive-scale homicide of  the civilian population, hostage taking, terror, and so on. By  the way, the same happened in France in 1793-1795, in the United  States in 1861-1865, and Spain in 1936-1939. Hence, conclusions  regarding the alleged special cruelty of the civil war of  1918-1920, ostensibly specific to our country, clearly need to  be revised.    In my opinion the time has long come to also sort out what  content we place in the notion "civil war." One can see, as they  say, "with the naked eye" that some researchers see civil war as  a process of armed struggle between citizens of the  same country, between different parts of society, while others  see civil war only as a period in the country's  history during which armed conflicts define its entire life. I  believe that both approaches have a right to exist (naturally,  provided clarification is made as to what precisely is meant),  and attempts to reject one of them only complicates the  substance of the matter. If we accept this postulate, however,  it will also make it much easier to answer the question of when  the civil war started and when it ended, as well as many other  questions.    If we look at the civil war in Russia as a  process, it will become clear that its first act were  the events in Petrograd and other cities at the end of February  1917. Armed clashes on the streets of the capital in April and  July; the Kornilov offensive in August; the "peasant uprising"  in September; the October events in Petrograd, Moscow, and a  number of other places in the country, as well as certain  episodes of the period which later was called "the triumphal  march of Soviet power," also fall into this category.    By the beginning of 1918 this phase had come to an end to a  large extent. This state of affairs is what Social  Revolutionaries' leader V. Chernov actually meant when in his 5  January speech to the Constituent Assembly he expressed hope for  an imminent end to the civil war. Of course, at the time seats  of civil war were still smoldering in Ukraine, North Caucasus  (the Volunteer Army), and a number of Cossack regions, but quite  a few people felt at the time that the stormy preceding period  was about to be replaced by a different, more peaceful one.  Contrary to these expectations, however, new seats of conflict  continued to flare up, and in the middle of 1918 the  period of civil war had already begun, ending only in  November 1920 with the defeat of P. Vrangel's army. Civil war  (as a process), however, still continued after that.  Among its episodes were the Kronstadt mutiny and Antonov's  offensive in 1921; the military actions in the Far East, which  ended in 1922; and the Basmach movement in Central Asia, mostly  liquidated by 1926, but completely eradicated only by 1933.    In my opinion, it is not only justifiable but also necessary  to look into another side of civil war. I mean the civil war  mentality as a very important part of the mass conscience. Here  are the two most popular formulae of this psychology: "If the  enemy does not surrender, he must be destroyed" and "Those who  are not with us are against us." Once such views set in, it  becomes impossible to speak of a "political adversary" (or even  a "scientific opponent"). These notions are replaced by that of  "enemy," which has to be unmasked and then destroyed unless he  surrenders (and sometimes even after he has surrendered and even  "admitted his guilt").    It is wrong to think that a civil war mentality comes into  existence with the beginning of armed conflicts and dies after  they end. Civil war (as a process) was already underway in  October-November of 1917, but political adversaries who  surrendered (and even participants in the armed struggle) not  only were not being destroyed--they were set free on their "word  of honor." These days it is considered improper to mention, for  instance, that the Bolsheviks released on their word of honor  not only many former ministers of the Provisional Government but  also cadets--participants in the 29 October rebellion--after  they promised not to fight against the Soviet power in the  future. General Krasnov also was set free on his word of honor  after being defeated on the battlefield--who, by the way, along  with many cadets, immediately continued armed struggle against  the Soviet power.    It took a rather lengthy period of time for the civil war  mentality to become part of the flesh and blood of the people of  that time. It is hard (probably impossible) to tell precisely  which of the opposing sides had the first decisive word. As  witnessed by a multitude of documents the author of this article  studied over many years, one of the first steps in this  direction was General L. Kornilov's order to the Volunteer Army  (January 1918): "Do not take any prisoners" (see in more detail  G.Z. Ioffe. "The White Affair. General Kornilov." Moscow, 1989,  p. 233). There is an ongoing argument as to which came  first--the "white terror" or the "red terror." I think we should  keep in mind this order by Kornilov, but there is another point  that is no less important. Both types of terror were closely  interconnected and served as justification for one another: If  "they" do this, "we" also have an absolute right to. It is this  "interaction" that produced this specific civil war atmosphere.    In my opinion, at this point a clarification is in order. In  our journalism (and sometimes in scientific literature as well)  the word "terror" is used in a broad sense, mixing together two  close but still distinct notions--"repression" and "terror." It  would suffice to look into the most elementary dictionary to  find out that repression is a "punitive measure, punishment,"  while terror is "a policy of intimidation, suppression of  political opponents by violent means" ("Foreign Words  Dictionary," Moscow, 1981, pp. 441, 505). Therefore, actions of  official organs aimed against real participants in  antigovernment actions cannot be classified as terror. Actions  against innocent people, on the other hand--hostage killing or  elimination of "persons of questionable background"  ("bourgeoisie" on one side of the front line and "proletarians"  on the other) should unquestionably be treated as terror. The  usual purpose of terror is to suppress potential opponents' and  their potential allies' will to continue the struggle. The  experience of civil war shows, however, that it is impossible to  break the will of a determined adversary by terror. Members of  the fence-sitting strata are another matter. True, as historical  experience shows, even among them the terror may cause a reverse  reaction--the desire to avenge the slain innocent. So its  practical effectiveness usually is not very high. It is my deep  conviction, however, that without terror the civil war mentality  could not establish itself and take root.    It is not accidental that the civil war mentality remained  one of the most important components of the mass conscience in  our country many decades after the armed struggle had ended. I  think that without it neither the mass violence against the  peasantry during collectivization nor the "repressions" of the  1930's to the early 1950's would have been possible.    I believe that the persistence of the civil war mentality  was  the result of a number of factors. They include the existence of  a considerable anti-Soviet diaspora that attempted to organize  its supporters inside the country in order to renew armed  struggle. Also the actions of Western and Eastern powers aimed  at the weakening (and subsequent overthrow) of Soviet power,  which were used by the official propaganda. And finally the  "Comintern" [Communist International] aspect of the mass  conscience, one of the elements of which was interpreting quite  disparate events in other countries as a continuation of the  civil war in Russia. I think that the horrible decision to kill  the captured Polish officers (the "Katyn incident") was made in  1940 precisely from the standpoint of the interests of "future  socialist revolution in Poland." Neither should we forget that a  certain component of the civil war also manifested itself in the  Great Patriotic War. I mean the white emigration supporting  Hitlerite occupiers, and the actions of Vlasov's and other  nationalist units fighting on the side of the Wehrmacht.    Essentially, we gradually began to overcome the civil war  mentality only at the time of Khrushchev's "thaw." The  completion of this process mainly fell on the years of  perestroyka, when Stalin's real political opponents (N.  Bukharin, G. Zinovyev, L. Kamenev, and others) were exonerated  and for the first time the question of the necessity of making  peace with those who had fought on the side of the whites in the  civil war was put on the agenda. At the same time, it would be  wrong to believe that the civil war mentality has been  eradicated once and for all. Unfortunately, the political and  economic instability in which we currently live contains an  inherent potential of its resurrection.    One of the most burning issues that attracts modern  society's  attention is: How do civil wars start? Sometime it is phrased  somewhat incorrectly: Who is at fault in starting them? Asking  the question from this angle essentially precludes the  possibility of scientific analysis. Instead of studying the  situations that lead to civil wars, people who phrase the  question this way not so much attempt to find a serious,  objective answer as to "brand" the guilty. And who exactly is to  be branded, these people usually know in advance. So, for a  researcher this approach is a dead end. In these conditions, I  think, what we need to do is identify the most typical  situations that lead to civil wars and look at each individually.    In my opinion, there are two basic situations that start  civil wars. One of them is related to an upcoming revolution,  and the other is not.    To start with, I would like to recall what Pitirim Sorokin  once said. "The fall of a regime," wrote Sorokin, "is usually  the result not so much of the efforts of revolutionaries as of  the growing decay, helplessness, and inability to perform  constructive work of the regime itself" (P.A. Sorokin. "The Long  Road." Moscow, 1992, p. 37). I think the key word here is  "constructive." In other words, in theory any revolution is  preventable. But for this the government must undertake certain  ("constructive") reforms that would remove the social tension  that accompanies a revolution in the making. Because of "decay,  helplessness, and inability to perform constructive work,"  however, neither the last government of the imperial Russia nor  the Provisional Government found in themselves the strength to  implement the necessary changes. And since the accelerating  events required action, it found an outlet in the attempts at  armed suppression against the people--more energetic in February  and much less active in October. Therefore, in such a situation  it is the government's actions that usually provide an impetus  for armed confrontation.    Naturally, I anticipate objections. Let us say, I can hear  some people saying, that you are right with respect to February.  But in October everything was different. The Bolsheviks were the  ones who engaged in the most preparations for armed  struggle--that is, the opponents of the existing regime--while  the Provisional Government only defended itself, and even that  it started doing too late. All this is true, but if we look  attentively at the course of events, we will inevitably come to  the conclusion that had it not been for the indeed weak and  generally meaningless efforts at armed resistance on the part of  the Provisional Government, the transfer of authority probably  would have proceeded peacefully, without armed clashes, and  therefore could not be considered as one of the episodes of the  civil war. Politically, in the eyes of a considerable part of  the socially active population the Provisional Government by  then was doomed--this is confirmed in the memoirs of most  contemporaries, with the exception probably of A. Kerenskiy and  those who shared his views. Thus, there was the possibility of a  peaceful transfer of power, which was not realized. I can hear  another objection: And what about the armed resistance of the  defenders of the Provisional Government in Moscow and in other  places? In this connection it is worth rereading the  reminiscences of October in Moscow of one of the "White Guard"  fighters, S. Efron. There people, too, by October were quite  disappointed in Kerenskiy and his government; after the failure  of Kornilov's offensive "nothing good" was in store for the  country; the Provisional Government was characterized as the  "damned Kerenskiy rule;" and quite understandably, Moscow  supporters of the Provisional Government looked at the "White  Guard" "with certain distrust or even apprehension," fearing a  "counterrevolution" (S. Efron. "October (1917)." BOLSHEVO  literary-cultural almanac, No. 2, Moscow, 1992, pp. 59, 61, 81).  But as long as the Provisional Government remained in power, the  chance remained that the country would turn to the right, to  order and stability. The "White Guard" of Moscow acted in  defense of this potential turn of events rather than  "in defense of the Provisional Government."    The example above (when episodes of a civil war are directly  tied to a revolution) may also be seen as a particular variety  of a more general approach to the problem, when the situation in  the country and society looks more stable. At the same time, we  have to emphasize that civil wars do not start in an environment  of social peace: One degree or another of social tension  necessarily precedes civil war. But neither should we gloss over  the difference between similar but still distinctly different  situations. In the former, we are dealing with a struggle  against a regime that has lost the real support of the  population. In the latter--a crisis being experienced by a  regime that enjoys the support of a considerable part of  socially active population. This particular version of  development of events is probably what we should look at  attentively.    The question of the conditions in which a civil war may  start  was considered by Lenin in his article "The Russian Revolution  and the Civil War," written in the first half of September 1917.  Lately it is being widely quoted in the press, but to my best  knowledge it has not yet become the subject of a special study.  Usually, only a part of Lenin's thesis is quoted--I believe, in  a form intentionally truncated for a certain political purpose.  The only words picked out are that "only a Bolshevik union with  the Social Revolutionaries and Mensheviks... would have made  civil war in Russia impossible," and then on the basis of this  the conclusion is drawn that the blame for the civil war rests  with the Bolsheviks for their refusal to form such a union.    Here is, however, how the appropriate part of the article  looks in unabridged form: "If there is a lesson of the  revolution that is absolutely inarguable and absolutely proven  by facts, it is only that only a Bolsheviks union with the  Social Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, only the immediate  transfer of all power to the soviets, would have made civil war  in Russia impossible. Because a civil war started by the  bourgeoisie is unthinkable against such a union, against the  deputies of the soviets of workers, soldiers, and peasants; such  a "war" would have not progressed even to a single battle..."  (V.I. Lenin. Complete Works, Vol. 43, p. 222). And further on:  "The bourgeoisie's resistance to the free-of-charge transfer of  land to the peasants, to similar transformations in other  spheres of life, to just peace and a break with  imperialism--such resistance is of course inevitable. But to see  such resistance spill over into civil war, you need at least  some masses, capable of fighting and  defeating the soviets. The bourgeoisie does not have such masses  and there is no place it can get them from" (Ibid., p. 223).    As we can see, what is being abridged is the second part of  the phrase, which essentially describes the conditions of  entering such a union--that its participants would agree to  transfer power to the soviets. And this is being dropped  intentionally, since, as is known, the Bolsheviks not only were  agreeable to forming a "homogeneous socialist government," but  also themselves offered that other socialist parties join the  Council of People's Commissars, but on one mandatory  condition--that all the members of this government agree to be  answerable to the soviets. It is this condition that the other  participants in the negotiations, which were then conducted by  Vikzhel, could not accept, and the idea of a "homogeneous  socialist ministry" never got off the ground.    This discourse has only an indirect bearing on our topic,  however, since in this part of Lenin's article the topic was the  possibility of averting a "minor" civil war stemming from the  transfer of power from the Provisional Government to the  soviets. Much more important, in my opinion, is another part of  the article in which it says that civil war may start in Russia  only when the opponents of the revolution "have at least some  masses, capable of fighting and defeating  the soviets" (ibid., p. 223). I think that this is precisely the  key to understanding the process of how a civil war begins. It  is not enough for the authority to have active political  opponents. Also necessary are masses willing to support them not  only in elections but also by directly taking part in an armed  struggle. That this thesis is correct is best confirmed by an  analysis of the events of the first half of 1918.    Over the past few years a version that has become popular in  our journalistic writing is that the disbandment of the  Constituent Assembly at the beginning of 1918 was the cause and  de facto beginning of the civil war. Meanwhile, the documents of  the Social Revolutionaries Party--at the time the Bolsheviks'  main adversary--and the memoirs of its leaders make it clear why  the Social Revolutionaries did not respond to this act by armed  struggle. At the time the Social Revolutionaries did not have  enough popular support, without which it was hopeless to launch  an insurrection. In these conditions, as the Social  Revolutionaries' leader V. Chernov reminisced later, the party  leadership "came almost unanimously to the conclusion that the  Constituent Assembly should be written off as a lost cause in  the capitals; what is left is to search somewhere else on the  territory of Russia for a place that would invite the  Constituent Assembly and offer it protection (...). Thus, in a  natural way, the idea began to form to move the Constituent  Assembly to the Urals-Volga region" (V.M. Chernov. "On the Eve  of the Storm." New York, 1953, p. 368). The Brest peace treaty;  the left-wing Social Revolutionaries walking out on the Council  of People's Commissars; the intensifying disagreement among the  Bolsheviks, Chernov continues, strengthened in the Social  Revolutionaries' ranks the irreconcilable opposition to the  Bolshevik dictatorship and the readiness to raise the banners of  insurrection against them at the first opportunity" (ibid.).  Right here, let us pay attention to the provisional "at the  first opportunity." This indicates an awareness that even in the  spring of 1918, in March-April, such an opportunity did not yet  exist.    The situation had changed by the beginning of the summer of  1918, when the policy of Soviet power in the countryside--to a  large extent forced by circumstances--and the arbitrariness of  its local organs caused acute discontent among the peasantry.  The Urals Cossacks rose against the Soviet power; anti-Soviet  riots spread over a number of areas in the Volga and Urals  regions; and at the end of May the Czechoslovak rebellion began.  "In these circumstances," writes Chernov, "in June 1918 the  Volga regional committee of the PSR [Party of Social  Revolutionaries] entered an alliance with the Urals Cossack Host  for the purpose of liquidating the Bolshevik dictatorship and  proclaiming the rule of the Constituent Assembly in the Volga  and Urals regions. The (PSR) Central Committee... ratified this  alliance agreement" (ibid., p. 373).    The events that followed are well known. On 8 June in  Samara,  occupied by Czechoslovak troops, the Social Revolutionaries  formed a Committee of Constituent Assembly Members, which  proclaimed itself the supreme authority in the country and began  an armed struggle against the Soviet power. Mobilization into  the "People's Army" was announced, and some time later the  country was sliced apart by the first front of a "major" civil  war.    Now perhaps it is time to summarize the above. Usually, a  civil war (with the exception of the instances of recent  revolution described above) is started by forces that are in  opposition to the existing regime, and only in circumstances  when they are certain of success (or at least hope for such  success). Without such an assumption, civil wars are not  started. In 1917 many groups hoped to win: the initiators of the  demonstration in April; the participants in the Petrograd  rebellion in July; General Kornilov in August; the participants  in the battles against establishing Soviet power in Moscow in  October-November hoped for help from the Headquarters and the  Cossacks; and so on. Sometimes such an appraisal of the  situation is justified (for instance, in April 1917, when mass  demonstrations resulted in the final analysis in the formation  of a coalition government with the participation of the  socialists). In other instances hopes for victory were crashed.  However, the outcome of the events in many respects was  predestined by the popular attitude to the participants in the  action.    It is no secret to anyone that the danger of a civil war  also  exists today. It is associated with the social tension that is  growing in the country as what the West calls the "social  security net" disappears, the standard of living declines, and  the threat of mass unemployment grows. And the only way to avert  a social explosion, and with it a civil war, lies, in my  opinion, not in constitutional drafts but in such steps in the  area of the economy and social policy that would remove social  tension in society. If, however, at the same time we continue to  contemplate only to what extent these steps are in line with  "free market ideals" and the values of "world civilization," we  may miss the opportunity, while civil war in some form or other  will, alas, loom inevitable.</p>

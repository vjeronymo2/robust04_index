			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Mozer's plea pact ruled still valid A US JUDGE ruled yesterday that a plea agreement between government prosecutors and Mr Paul Mozer, the former Salomon Brothers trader at the centre of the 1991 Treasury auction scandal, was still valid. The agreement had been rejected by another judge in January after Mr Mozer's lawyers had clashed with prosecutors over their interpretation of the wording of the document. Under the terms of the agreement Mr Mozer pleaded guilty to two felony counts of making false statements to US officials about fake bids he had submitted at a February 1991 auction of Treasury notes. Mr Stanley Arkin, Mr Mozer's lawyer, argued in January that as far as he was concerned the plea ensured the government could not bring additional criminal charges against his client on possible violations of anti-trust laws. Federal prosecutors, however, disagreed and insisted the plea still left open the possibility of anti-trust charges. On January 11, Judge Robert Patterson decided that the serious nature of the disagreement between the two sides meant he could not accept Mr Mozer's guilty plea. Yesterday, however, Judge Pierre Leval ruled that the federal prosecutors could not back out of the original agreement, arguing that the government had 'acted inconsistently with the terms of the plea agreement'. The ruling improves Mr Mozer's chances of escaping a jail sentence. If the judge had ruled the plea invalid, Mr Mozer would have faced the four criminal charges, including fraud, that were filed by prosecutors after the plea agreement collapsed. If found guilty, he could have faced a long jail term. Federal prosecutors said yesterday they would not appeal Judge Leval's decision.</p>

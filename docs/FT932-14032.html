			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Nissan UK executive denies Pounds 97m fraud THREE DIRECTORS of Nissan UK, the former British importer for the Japanese carmaker, cheated the Inland Revenue out of almost Pounds 97m corporation tax in a fraud of 'truly massive proportions' that lasted 17 years, a court heard yesterday. Mr Peter Rook QC, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey in London that the fraud centred on the use of false invoices to increase freight costs charged in the company's accounts, so reducing profits on which corporation tax had to be paid. He said that to conceal the fraud an international money-laundering network was set up involving bogus shipping agents in The Netherlands and Norway and ending at two Swiss banks - Credit Suisse and BFG. Mr Rook was opening the prosecution of Mr Michael Hunt, the assistant managing director of Nissan UK, who is charged with four counts of conspiring to cheat the Revenue and making use of false documents. Mr Hunt denies all the charges. Mr Hunt was at the centre of the conspiracy, the court heard, with Mr Octav Botnar, Nissan UK chairman and chief executive, and Mr Frank Shannon, the company's former finance director. Mr Botnar was the 'prime mover' but Mr Hunt, as his 'number two', was party to the fraud from start to finish, Mr Rook said. A warrant for Mr Botnar's arrest was issued last year but could not be served because he had moved to Switzerland. Earlier this year Mr Shannon pleaded guilty to cheating the Revenue of Pounds 17m corporation tax. His admission was evidence of a fraud against the Revenue, Mr Rook said. In 1971 Nissan UK won the British franchise to import cars from the Nissan Motor Company. Until 1975 it paid for the cars with a single 'cost, insurance and freight' payment. In 1975 it varied this agreement, allowing it to arrange its own freight charges. The intention was to enable the fraud to take place, Mr Rook said. In the years that followed a total of Pounds 219m was extracted from Nissan UK by fabricating invoices which increased the genuine freight charges by between 40 per cent and 60 per cent on each occasion. The conspirators set up an international laundering operation to cover their tracks. Mr Rook said: 'The trail leads to two Swiss banks where the conspirators would divide the spoils of the fraud.' Mr Walter Schmicki, a Credit Suisse banker, and Mr Kurt Vogelsang, a manager of BFG in Basle, were party to the fraud, he continued. The trial continues today and is expected to last at least three months.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar took his  place in parliament today during the discussion of Deputy  Pittner's proposal to take a vote of no confidence in the Slovak  Republic Government.    Pavol Kanis, from the Party of the Democratic Left, asked  the  prime minister to address parliament.    [Begin Meciar recording] Esteemed ladies and gentlemen,  esteemed Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to take the opportunity  given to me by parliament to speak. This did not use to be the  habit in these rooms in the past.    I have, however, been unable to acquaint myself with the  speech by the president. I was receiving the World Jewish  Congress's delegation during his address. There is no written  record (?of his speech). The government members were acquainted  with the speech. I was, unfortunately, present at the  discussion (?here in the back of this hall), and, hence, I  missed the government session. I do not even have the papers  that the government has.    I would consider it an honor to speak about these matters  tomorrow. But do not ask me to speak today. I am not familiar  with the issue on which I am to express an opinion. [end  recording]    [Announcer] We are ready to broadcast the prime minister's  speech in a live relay on ST2 tomorrow. [passage omitted]</p>

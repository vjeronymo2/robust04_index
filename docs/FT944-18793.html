			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Evasion - or avoidance? We have a deposit account with an English building society on the Isle of Man, primarily to receive interest before tax is deducted. Would it be legal  -that is, tax avoidance rather than tax evasion - if, when the interest was due, we travelled to the island, withdrew the interest and spent the money there? And would we need to declare the amount of interest spent on our next tax return? You forgot to tell us where you and your husband are domiciled. If, as well as being resident and ordinarily resident in the UK, you and your husband are domiciled in England and Wales (or in Scotland or in Northern Ireland), then you are liable to pay UK tax on the Manx interest regardless of whether or not it is remitted to the mainland. On the other hand, if (despite being resident and ordinarily resident in the UK) you and your husband are domiciled somewhere else, you would not have to pay UK tax on the interest. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

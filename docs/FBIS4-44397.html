			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Lu Chunping (4151 2504 1627): "Urumqi's </F> Courts Bring Their Judicial Function To Full Play: Attack Crime,  Protect Public, Safeguard Stability"]    [Text] Urumqi's courts at both levels gave full play to  their judicial function to preserve social stability and protect  the people's and the legal persons' legal rights. Last year,  they tried and concluded 19,074 assorted court cases, 16.43  percent more than in the previous year.    Urumqi's courts at both levels tried and sentenced 1,499  criminal elements who had committed murder, rape, hooliganism  and robbery, or deliberate assault and other serious crimes.  They also held prompt and open public trials, proving that they  were serious about their assault on crime. They also launched a  series of special crackdowns and tried and wrapped up 578 crime  cases involving theft, drug trafficking, and trademark  counterfeiting.    As the case load increased and difficult cases multiplied,  the entire judicial and cadre and police contingent dealing with  civil cases further speeded up the handling of real estate,  debt, and labor dispute cases, properly dealt with marriage and  family and inheritance cases, and promptly resolved disputes and  settled conflicts to further promote stability, unity, and the  socialist spiritual civilization.</p>

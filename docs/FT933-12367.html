			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Black Arrow Black Arrow Group, the office furniture and leasing finance company, yesterday reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 1.34m to Pounds 2.03m for the year to end-March. The outcome was struck on turnover up by Pounds 3.87m to Pounds 20.4m - the figures are prepared on an FRS 3 basis. Mr Arnold Edward, chairman, said the improvement had been achieved despite poor trading conditions over the period, although they had been reinforced by an exceptional gain of Pounds 668,000 on the sale of a trading property. However, since the year end there had been a deterioration, he added, and trading profits were likely to be depressed in the first half of the current year. A maintained final dividend of 1.6p is proposed making 2.6p (2.1p) for the year. The dividend is almost twice covered by earnings of 5.02p (3.79p) per share.</p>

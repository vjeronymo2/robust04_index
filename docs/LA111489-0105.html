			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: THE INSIDE DIRT ON CAMPAIGNS  </P> <P> Dirty Eddie, campaign manager for Howard McClintic, was packing up his  literature and campaign signs.  </P> <P> "I am proud of the fact that it was a clean political campaign," he told me.  "Race never played a role in the contest -- not once, even when we said that  our opponent went to school with Willie Horton."  </P> <P> "But McClintic was white and so was his opponent."  </P> <P> "All the more reason for not mentioning the race issue. At the beginning of the  campaign, McClintic announced that he would not introduce color as an issue. He  stuck to his promise."  </P> <P> "With that statement, he made it an issue."  </P> <P> "McClintic never made it an issue. His opponent, Glockenspiel, did when he  attacked McClintic for raising it in the first place."  </P> <P> Dirty Eddie continued, "When we started out we decided to take the high road in  the campaign -- even if it meant losing."  </P> <P> "Is that why you ran a TV commercial of Glockenspiel beating up senior citizens  in a public park?"  </P> <P> "We felt that the voters had a right to know what turned Glockenspiel on. Was  it less fair than the other side showing our guy in a raincoat flashing in  front of a McDonald's restaurant?"  </P> <P> "I am curious about how you managed to get film of Glockenspiel and Noriega  riding in the same seat on the Ferris wheel."  </P> <P> "It's incredible what you can do with a computer these days."  </P> <P> "Dirty Eddie, I know you ran a clean campaign, but there are some who feel that  you spread stories about Glockenspiel which weren't necessarily true."  </P> <P> "Like what?"  </P> <P> "Like the time you said that he had to take steroids before he could go out to  campaign."  </P> <P> "We only mentioned it when they claimed that McClintic was a compulsive gambler  and bet on his own race. We weren't looking for low-down things to say about  the other side, but you have to fight fire with fire, or your election will go  up in smoke. We had so much dirty stuff that we didn't use."  </P> <P> "Such as?"  </P> <P> "Glockenspiel has one of the highest cholesterol counts of anyone running for  office this year."  </P> <P> "Why didn't we know that?"  </P> <P> "He keeps his cholesterol results in a numbered Swiss bank account."  </P> <P> "Dirty Eddie, it seems to me that the last two weeks of the campaign were the  worst. Both sides took off their gloves. After what we saw, are you still  trying to tell me that you ran a clean campaign?"  </P> <P> "I'd bet my life on it. We were entirely issue-oriented."  </P> <P> "Was that why you leaked the story about your opponent being the serial killer  of Gladly Heights?"  </P> <P> "We didn't say that he was. We just raised the question. That's what political  campaigns are all about. If someone running for office is a serial killer, the  public has a right to be informed. We didn't claim that he was unfit for the  job."  </P> <P> I asked him, "What are you doing with all that stuff you're packing away?"  </P> <P> "Saving it for next year. Politicians will pay anything in 1990 to find a  squeaky clean campaign manager like myself."  </P></p>

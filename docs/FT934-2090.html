			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / International Equity Issues: Sterlite continues steady stream of Indian borrowers Sterlite Industries, an Indian manufacturer of telephone cables, copper rod, and aluminium sheet and foil, made its debut in the international capital market yesterday with the launch of a Dollars 90m Euro-convertible bond issue. The deal, due to be priced later this week, is the latest in a string of issues from Indian borrowers, all eager to raise finance from international investors. This steady stream shows little sign of abating next year. Indian companies have raised nearly Dollars 800m this year with an assortment of international equity and convertible bond issues, compared with a total of Dollars 240m in 1992, according to figures from Euromoney Bondware. This year's deals include a Dollars 140m convertible bond from Reliance Industries, the textiles and chemicals group, and a Dollars 75m global depositary receipts issue from Mahindra and Mahindra, the Indian truck manufacturer. But such deals are likely to be dwarfed by the launch - probably in the first quarter of 1994 - of an international equity offering from Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited, the Indian state-controlled international telecommunications network. Investment bankers expect the offering to raise more than Dollars 500m, which would be the biggest share offer by an Indian company and the first from the public sector. Salomon Brothers and Kleinwort Benson are co-global co-ordinators. VSNL will be the first telecom issue to surface from this particular emerging market, and so is expected to meet with considerable interest from specialist India funds as well as from funds with a broader investment brief. 'It's the telecom company . . . people have always viewed telecoms (shares) as core holdings, such as Telmex or Singapore Telecom: if you're going to hold something in this market, this is the one you hold because it's the most visible stock which is going to reflect the growth in the economy,' says one international equity specialist. The Indian government's economic reforms have sparked considerable interest among international investors in the market. While some of the international equity offerings got off to a shaky start, recent launches have generally been well received and have risen well above launch price. Gujarat Ambuja Cement, the Indian cement company, issued a Dollars 75m convertible bond issue at par at the end of November, which is now trading at 130 according to Jardine Fleming, the lead manager. Jardine Fleming said the Indian rally was being driven by liquidity from US and UK investors who could put as much as Dollars 200m-Dollars 400m into a range of Indian equities. 'These funds are still massively underweight in India and want to raise their exposure,' the lead manager said. Mr Roger Bade, emerging markets fund manager at Commercial Union, said: 'India is one of the more exciting emerging market stories. The political risk has diminished since local elections.'</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Bonds: Hopes of currency rise spark dollar deals THREE tightly-priced Eurodollar bond issues were launched in the international bond market yesterday, hoping to attract those investors expecting an increase in the value of the US currency. The biggest deal of the day came from SBAB, the Swedish National Mortgage Association, which launched a Dollars 400m six-year bond issue lead managed by Nomura International. The bonds carry an 8 1/2 per cent coupon, the highest of the three issues yesterday, and were priced to yield 60 basis points above the US Treasury bond yield curve. SBAB is rated Triple-A by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit-rating agency, and few other borrowers of this credit quality offer such a wide yield spread over Treasuries. For example, Italy's six-year Eurodollar bonds trade at a spread of about 59 basis points. However, participants in the deal commented that the best demand for dollar paper was at the shorter three-year to five-year maturities. The lead manager held the deal at the fixed reoffer level until the close of trading. At the shorter three-year maturity, Union Bank of Finland came with a Dollars 200m deal lead managed by Morgan Stanley International. The bonds carry an 8 per cent coupon and were reoffered to investors at the fixed price of 99.75, where the yield spread over Treasuries is 79 basis points. The lead manager reported strong buying interest from institutional investors which have until recently declined to buy paper issued by banks and corporations. Investors switching into dollar bonds in anticipation of currency gains were attracted by the short maturity. However, co-managers in the deal experienced slow going and the deal was again held at the fixed reoffer price throughout the day. Daimler-Benz, the German industrial conglomerate, launched a Dollars 250m five-year deal lead managed by Deutsche Bank Capital Markets. The 8 1/4 per cent bonds were priced to yield 49 basis points over US Treasuries. Daimler-Benz is not rated by any of the big credit-rating agencies, but is generally regarded by investors as having triple-A credit quality and is one of the few European companies to tap the market regularly. In addition to institutional demand, the lead manager expected substantial placement among German and Swiss retail accounts. The supply of sterling bonds was maintained by Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone, which came with a Pounds 100m 10-year issue lead managed by Warburg Securities. On Monday, Warburg lead managed a Pounds 150m 10-year deal for Export-Import Bank of Japan, the first Japanese issuer in the sterling market for some years. Yesterday's deal was priced to yield 50 basis points above the 10 per cent UK government bond maturing 2001 - four basis points more than for Ex-Im Bank. The lead manager said that about 70 per cent of the issue had been placed with UK institutions keen to gain exposure to one of the world's largest companies.</p>

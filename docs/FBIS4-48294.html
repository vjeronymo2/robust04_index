			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 13 SAPA -- Western Areas gold mine  management reached an agreement with two warring factions on its  mine on Friday, ending fighting which led to the killing of six  miners since last weekend. Mine owners Johannesburg Consolidated  Investment [JCI] Gold Division Chairman Kennedy Maxwell said the  parties agreed to a code of conduct, security arrangements and a  high-level committee to investigate the causes of conflict.    In terms of the agreement mine security personnel and  National Peace Secretariat monitors would be deployed  underground where four miners were killed on Wednesday.    Western areas consulting engineer John Brownriggs said  miners  had agreed to resume work on Saturday.    Search teams comprising mine security, the South African  National Defence Force, the Internal Stability Unit and the  National Peace Secretariat had confisticated eight tons of  home-made weapons during hostel searches in the past week.    Mr Brownriggs said initial indications were that the faction  fighting was a sequel to the killing of two Zulu miners  returning from an Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] rally on April 17.  Subsequent to the arrest of a Xhosa suspect on May 4, renewed  tension arose in the mine when a group went to the mine  management demanding the release of their arrested colleague, he  added.    JCI was assessing production losses resulting from the work  stoppages during the conflict and would make an announcement  next week, Mr Maxwell said.    Production had continued throughout the period as white  miners had continued working.    National Union of Mineworkers [NUM] Assistant General  Secretary Gwede Mantashe said the code of conduct agreed to with  JCI provided for the control of access to mine hostels,  possession of weapons as a dismissable offence and control of  visits by non-hostel dwellers. Mr Mantashe blamed the conflict  on the housing of workers on ethnic lines and the promotion of  IFP-aligned elements to undermine the NUM.    Mr Maxwell conceded that historically workers had been  housed  according to ethnic affiliations, but JCI had started  negotiations a year ago to abolish ethnic housing.    JCI Gold Division human resources manager Craig Lawrence  said  the transformation from compulsory segregation to integration  was a sensitive and difficult problem, with no consensus among  all those involved.</p>

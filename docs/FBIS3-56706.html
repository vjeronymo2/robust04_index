The consultations enabled a wide range of  problems relating to the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina to  be discussed.    Vitaliy Churkin told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that the  current round of talks on the Bosnian settlement, which started  in Geneva on Tuesday [18 January], "is progressing with  difficulty." "The aggravation of the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina provides unfavorable conditions for the  negotiating process," said the Russian representative.  "Nevertheless, there are some bright spots. It seems that we  have managed to resolve the problem of replacing Canadian blue  helmets with the Dutch in Srebrenica, the UN security zone. We  are satisfied with this development and expect no further  problems."</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt climbs on Ifo profits forecast Bourses were mostly subdued as they waited for today's FOMC meeting in Washington and the rise in interest rates that it is expected to bring, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT advanced on the firm dollar and a stable German bond market. The Dax index closed 10.94 higher on the session at 2,089.29, and improved further in Ibis trading to end the post bourse at 2,091.04. Turnover fell from DM5bn to DM4.4bn. Equities were encouraged by the Ifo economic research institute forecast that profits in west German industry could jump by 150 per cent to a total of around DM50bn in 1994. Financials were strong on the hope that the Federal Reserve may help stabilise global interest rates, and bond markets, with its decision today. Allianz recovered DM41 to DM2,416 on the session and Commerzbank by DM7 to DM326. Elsewhere it was mostly a day for individual stockpicking. Schering, the pharmaceuticals group, gained DM9.70 at DM969, encouraged by a full-year sales forecast of DM350m for its BetaSeron multiple sclerosis drug, rising by 50 per cent in 1995. The market had expected full-year sales of around DM300m. SAP, the computer software group, hit a new 1994 high of DM1,003, up DM26 on a big business deal with IBM of the US; Computer 2,000, which announced a 'strategic alliance' leading to a majority stake in AmeriQuest Technologies of Irvine, California, rose DM20 to DM460. MILAN was enlivened by a flurry of late buy orders after a session marking time ahead of the parliamentary confidence vote on a budget measure offering a tax amnesty on building work. The Comit index was 0.92 lower at 640.13 while the real-time Mibtel index finished with a gain of 63 to 10,264. Construction stocks turned in another strong performance on hopes of new contracts following the recent floods in the northwest of the country. Unicem rose L282 to L10,512 and Grassetto put on L88 to L1,816. Shares in electricity companies rose strongly on speculation that they will take a bigger share of Italy's power generation market following the privatisation of the electricity giant, Enel. Edison picked up L165 to L6,726 and Sondel was L55 ahead at L2,530. Banks continued to be driven by takeover speculation. Romagnolo fell L445 to L16,166 on news that it had obtained approval to merge with Cassa di Risparmio di Bologna as a poison pill measure. PARIS, back from holiday, managed to combine one or two quite sharp individual gains with a lack of general impetus as the country saw its third cabinet minister since July resign under a cloud. The CAC-40 index fell 7.27 to 1,941.08 in turnover of FFr2.89bn. The most outstanding gain, FFr8.90, or 6.1 per cent to FFr154 in Thomson CSF, the big electronics group on the French privatisation list, came on the rumour that the consumer electronics division might be floated off first, and separately before the defence side of the business. Meanwhile, Eurotunnel rose FFr1.70 to FFr22.65 on a successful trip for the first train carrying fare-paying passengers on the new Eurostar express service. ZURICH edged lower after a firm, dollar driven opening. The SMI index fell 6.9 to 2,590.9. Ciba fell SFr21 to SFr741 amid rumours, prompted by a press report, that it was to buy a 49 per cent stake in Chiron, the US drugs group. Ciba declined comment. Roche certificates fell SFr30 to SFr5,780 on news that Mr Peter Simon, head of the pharmaceutical division, was to leave the group at the end of the year. Holderbank, the cement producer, picked up SFr20 to SFr1,035 after telling the autumn news conference that it had no plans to raise fresh capital in the near future and that its North American branch was set to make substantial profits for the first time in several years. AMSTERDAM's international stocks were supported by the firm dollar and the AEX index picked up 1.23 to 408.92. Aegon closed up Fl 1.20 at Fl 107.40 on its better-than-expected nine months results and improved forecast; other financials finished narrowly mixed. Royal Dutch Petroleum rose Fl 1.50 to Fl 189.50, supported by the firm dollar while Philips gained 70 cents to Fl 53.20 as last week's US selling faded and the stock staged a technical rebound. PolyGram rose Fl 1.40 to Fl 76.40. KNP BT rose 50 cents to Fl 50.30, ahead of third quarter results on Friday and on the positive outlook for the paper business. Nutricia closed up 30 cents at Fl 90.10, rebounding on speculative buying: the market hoped that Unigate would make an announcement about the sale of its 30.2 per cent stake, Nutricia has half year results due on Wednesday. TEL AVIV ran into more trouble. Following Sunday's fall of 4.51, or 2.45 per cent in the Mishtanim index, with mutual funds dumping equities to meet investor redemptions, equities ran into more selling and the index fell another 2.27, or 1.3 per cent to 277.31. WARSAW registered its sixth successive fall, and threatened its 1994 low of 7,215.2 as the Wig index fell another 210.2, or 2.8 per cent to 7,235.9. Turnover rose 6.5 per cent to 405bn zlotys, and dealers said that they expected the June low to be tested later in the week.

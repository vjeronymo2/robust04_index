			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Front line fight against Aids 'COMBAT ready, condom ready', shouts a poster in all the Ghana army barracks. 'Take the firing squad to Aids]' shouts another. The US military worries about having soldiers with their finger on a nuclear button who are HIV-positive. The French army has been checking to find out whether, and how, its soldiers have sex when they are flown out to intervene in some attempted coup d'etat in one of France's ex-colonies in Africa (yes indeed, some of them do have sex.) The Nigerian chief of defence staff has set up a special secretariat to co-ordinate anti-Aids activities in the army and police. But what, I asked the Ministry of Defence, are the British armed services doing about Aids? I got a very stiff-upper-lip reply. 'It is not our practice to discuss individual medical cases,' said the man from the MoD, quoting almost verbatim a reply given in the House of Commons on March 12 1990 by Archie Hamilton, then a junior defence minister, to an MP who had dared to ask a similar question. However, Hamilton did get as far as admitting that 'one member of the services was identified as HIV-positive in 1989' - a statistic that experience in other countries suggests may be on the low side. The US army has found that about one in 600 of those it has tested carry the virus, although admittedly the US does have a far higher general incidence of Aids than the UK. The US military has taken a tough and open line on this matter. HIV-positive soldiers remain in the army for as long as they are fit for active duties, but they are kept firmly away from sensitive 'finger on the button' posts in nuclear weapons commands. 'Not a good place to put someone who knows they are going to die anyway,' commented a senior US army medical officer to me recently. For it is a grim fact that sooner or later, perhaps as long as 10 years or more later, the HIV virus inevitably progresses to full-scale Aids and death. Surely the British public has a right to know, too? It may not be exactly an election issue, but Britain also has soldiers with their fingers on nuclear buttons, and presumably annual medical check-ups either can or do show who is HIV-positive and who is not. The man from the MoD hastened to assure me that this policy of silence about Aids did not mean that the British army had no policy at all on the matter - just that it was not prepared to talk about it. Well, let us give the Ministry the benefit of the doubt, while pointing out that the 'whose finger on the nuclear button' issue is not the only Aids question that matters in the military context. For example, the armies of the US and Ghana army have both taken the view that HIV-positive soldiers should not be posted abroad. You can see why. In sensitive political situations, they could easily be accused of wilfully spreading the deadly disease to host and/or invaded countries. Ghana's efficient professional army, made up of 20-year enlisted men, is a favourite contributor to international peace-keeping forces, as is the Nigerian army, and it would hardly do if it became known that these peace-carriers were death-carriers also. Confinement to the mother country also has a deterrent effect against soldiers taking risks over contracting Aids. In the Ghana army, a sure route to promotion is service abroad - and vice versa. Also, service abroad brings with it lucrative foreign allowances, lots of cash, which the HIV-positive man confined to home duties is deprived of. It would be good to know whether a similar rule applies to British military personnel. Britain also sends troops abroad, as part of UN forces and for training, including Kenya, where Aids is a serious problem. But apparently the British public is not to know what the rule is. Nor are people to know whether the soldier who is infected by HIV is treated with due respect - that is, in a way that would avoid any charge of discrimination against sufferers. The US army has a formal policy that an HIV-positive soldier can continue to receive full army medical care and army housing for as long as he (or she, one supposes) is still fit for duties. After that, the soldier is retired on standard retirement benefits; that is, honourably retired. It is impossible to rule out the possibility that some armies might take a different view. A senior officer in the Ghana army told me that, if other measures failed to stem the spread of the disease among military personnel, then getting Aids might have to be made a dismissable offence. So there are issues here about the civil and military rights of HIV-positive people; about non-discrimination; and about the practical benefits guaranteed (or not) to soldiers who test HIV-positive. Maybe that was what was on the mind of the MP, Harry Cohen, who asked that question back in March 1990. 'What action was followed after (HIV) diagnosis,' he wanted to know, asking also whether any representations had subsequently been received concerning the military authorities' actions in these cases. 'There were no representations concerning this (one) case,' replied Hamilton. Rex Winsbury is editor / publisher of AIDS Analysis Africa.</p>

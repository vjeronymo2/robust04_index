			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>   [Text] One of China's most prominent dissidents, Xu Wenli,  has been released from police custody after being held for  questioning for five days, relatives said yesterday.    Mr Xu's sister said the former Democracy Wall activist was  released from a police station yesterday morning and had  returned to his nearby home. Another relative said he appeared  in quite good health and did not seem to have been adversely  affected by his ordeal.    However, Mr Xu still appears to be under some form of house  arrest. A contingent of police officers were still stationed at  the entrance to his apartment complex yesterday, preventing  foreign journalists from entering. And the caretaker at Mr Xu's  building was refusing to put telephone calls through to his  apartment.    The Ministry of Public Security said Mr Xu, 50, had been  summoned by police on Thursday after "violating the conditions  of his parole" but refused to say what offences he had allegedly  committed. It is generally assumed, however, that Mr Xu was  taken in connection with the investigation into Wei Jingsheng's  political activities.    Wei was detained on April 2 as he tried to return to Beijing  from nearby Tianjin. The Public Security Ministry later  confirmed that Wei was being investigated for "suspected new  crimes" committed while on parole and while being deprived of  his political rights.    Mr Xu had met Wei on several occasions since the latter's  release from more than 14 years in jail last September. But Mr  Xu had kept a relatively low profile since being released from  12 years in jail last May, not talking to foreign journalists or  openly criticising the Government.    In Los Angeles, the U.S. Commerce Undersecretary said the  Clinton administration was "deeply troubled" by Beijing's recent  crackdown on dissidents and warned China that it must do more if  it wants to maintain U.S. trade privileges. Jeffrey Garten said  both nations want to see a renewal of China's Most Favoured  Nation (MFN) trading status, with the clock ticking ever closer  to a June deadline for action.    "I know that the Government of China understands the stakes,  as do we," Mr Garten said. "I strongly hope that enough progress  will be made on the human-rights front to allow both countries  to move to a more normal trading framework and then beyond."    Mr Garten, the department's top man for international trade  matters, spoke as a high-level Chinese delegation began a U.S.  tour aimed at pressing upon the Clinton administration the value  of continued U.S.-Sino trade. Mr Garten praised the delegation  head, China's Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic  Co-operation Wu Yi, and stressed the value of continued U.S.  relations with the world's fastest growing economy.    Ms Wu, however, warned that the U.S. would lose the huge  China market if it revoked MFN. Products, technology and  funding from other countries would flow into the mainland, she  said.    She said China would suffer as a result of the termination  of  the MFN status, but added it would hurt the U.S. even more.</p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: TOMBSTONE TERRITORY  </P> <P> The resurrection of Jim Morrison continues: The late lead singer of the Doors,  who'll be the subject of a soon-to-shoot film directed by Oliver Stone, is  currently the subject of a decidedly offbeat video tribute by German singer  Nina Hagen.  </P> <P> The video -- yet to be issued here -- opens at Morrison's Paris gravesite,  where a Morrison look-alike with angel's wings is perched on the gravestone.  </P> <P> Nina appears from a cluster of fans to take a heavenly phone call -- Mahalia  Jackson requesting that Nina sing the gospel tune "Hold Me." Nina protests,  "But I'm a white chick." Mahalia talks her into it.  </P> <P> The rest of the video finds Nina dancing and singing through Paris streets,  doing "Hold Me" rock 'n' roll style.  </P> <P> For PolyGram's Mercury label, it's a cut from an album titled "Nina Hagen,"  available domestically only as an import. From Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

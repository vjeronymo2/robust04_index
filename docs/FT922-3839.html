			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Culture blamed for conflict with Japan JAPAN practises a different form of capitalism from those of the US and Britain. Neither side fully understands that, so each accuses the other of cheating to protect markets, according to Professor Ronald Dore, an economist at the London School of Economics. Prof Dore, an authority on how companies operate in the three countries, said yesterday there was a Darwinian struggle between Japanese and Anglo-Saxon concepts of capitalism. Addressing a Manchester Business School conference on Japanese multinational companies, he said the Anglo-Saxon model made return on investment its first priority, while this had ninth place in Japanese capitalism's priorities. Japan placed most emphasis on maintaining market share to safeguard jobs in companies and their suppliers. Prof Dore said that was reflected in the Anglo-Saxon method of regular, competitive tendering for sub-contracts and the sharp contrast of Japanese companies' long-term relationships with suppliers. The divergence also showed in equity markets. US and UK companies feared their shares being instantly traded if they fell out of favour with investors. In Japan, between 65 per cent and 80 per cent of any company's shares were held by other Japanese companies with which they did business, so they did not rock one another's boats. The overall result was that Anglo-Saxon capitalism was driven by self-interest while the Japanese model was more concerned with collective good. Prof Dore said that although people feared Japan would win the battle, this might not happen. Each system was borrowing the other's ideas and much evolution was by imitation rather than one species wiping out its competitor.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Abdelrahmane Haidari] </F>   [Text] Sanaa, May 5 (AFP) -- Civil war broke out in Yemen  on Thursday [5 May] between rival northern and southern forces,  with warplanes bombing airports and government buildings and the  president declaring a state of emergency.    France decided to evacuate its citizens from the country,  which was united only four years ago and whose rival leaders  from the old North and South Yemen have been in dispute since  last August.    A southern air raid on Sanaa airport lit the fuse, prompting  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, a northerner, to order a 30-day  state of emergency to counter "separatist" forces based in the  southern port city of Aden.    The airport was closed to civilian airliners, while a  northern raid on Aden airport also forced its closure.    A northern military spokesman later said all-out fighting  erupted between rival troops in the seven main provinces, all on  or near the border which used to divide the country at the  southern tip of the Arabian peninsula.    Five southern warplanes were shot down, he said, quoted by  the official news agency Saba'. Southern troops had suffered  heavy losses in the clashes at Lahij, Abyan, Ta'izz, al-Bayda',  Dhamar, Aden and Ibb.    There was no immediate casualty toll.    Tanks and troops patrolled the streets of the capital, as  panic- buyers swamped the shops and many families packed up and  headed for the countryside in trucks loaded with mattresses and  boxes.    Later as night fell, more anti-aircraft fire was heard over  Sanaa. The streets were totally deserted of civilians and the  city was hit by an electricity black-out.    Salih and his vice president, 'Ali Salim al-Bid have been in  dispute for eight months on the running of the country created  when former North Yemen and the poorer, Marxist south unified on  May 22, 1990.    A reconciliation accord they signed in Amman on February 20  failed to ease the tension, with al-Bid calling for  decentralization and series of military, political and economic  reforms.    A diplomat, contacted by telephone from the United Arab  Emirates (UAE), said there had also been heavy gunfire around  Salih's palace.    Southern planes bombed the government headquarters and a  radio and television centre in a dawn raid, witnesses said.  Anti-aircraft guns shot down one of the planes, which crashed  in southern Sanaa in a black cloud of smoke.    Witnesses said northern forces were quick to take their  revenge, destroying the Sanaa headquarters of al-Bid's Yemen  Socalist Party, and tanks had been positioned on the rubble.    The Italian embassy next door was also damaged.    US special envoy Robert Pelletreau met Salih to express his  country's support for the "unity and democracy" in Yemen, Saba'  said.    The US state department on Wednesday proposed a plan for the  warring factions to separate their forces, agree to halt  redeployments, establish better communications and reestablish  dialogue.    In Paris, the foreign ministry said France was evacuating  all  its nationals from Aden because of the fighting and would help  any other foreigners from European Union countries.    About 60 French nationals live in Aden, the foreign ministry  said, but it could not specify how many other Europeans were  there or in Yemen overall.    The French government earlier ordered its forces at its  major  base in nearby Djibouti to prepare for the possible mass  evacuation of foreigners.    In London, the Foreign Office called for the rival Yemeni  chiefs to "reengage urgently a dialogue."    Britain has not ordered its people out of Yemen but said  they  could take advantage of the French evacuation if they wanted.  The 800 Britons, most of whom work in the oil industry, should  "keep their heads down."    Britain was the colonial power in Aden until quitting in  1967  after much bloodshed.    Airports in the towns of Ta'izz in the south and al-Hudaydah  in the west also came under attack Thursday from southern planes  but were not hit, the defence ministry said.    Clashes have also been going on since Wednesday between  northern and southern units in Dhamar, about 100 kilometres (60  miles) south of Sanaa, in Aden and in Redfan in the north.    A southern unit was reportedly wiped out by northern troops  in fighting overnight in Dhamar.    Tension was also running high in Abyan, to the east of Aden  and in Shabwah where the majority of the country's vital  oilfields are based.    Last week, fighting broke out in the town of 'Imran, north  of  Sanaa, killing 79 people, according to official northern  figures. Other reports spoke of more than 200 dead.    Yemen's giant northern neighbour Saudi Arabia appealed  Thursday for its leaders to "put the national interest" above  all others and halt the escalating fighting, as Egypt joined in  calls for an end to the bloodshed.    A plane carrying Arab League mediators was unable to land  because of the bombing of the capital's airport, league  secretary general 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid said in Cairo.    The rival army forces in Yemen, which each have about 30,000  troops, have never been merged and the country has been plagued  by tribal and political feuds.    Each side is supported by rival tribes, which are  well-equipped and can together raise forces of about 100,000.</p>

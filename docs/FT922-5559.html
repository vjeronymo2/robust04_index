			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Canary Wharf move upsets equities NEWS that Canary Wharf, the docklands property development, is being put into administration provided the trigger for another round of profit-taking and general selling pressure in London. Worries that the latest moves could lead to the big UK banks taking substantial provisions against their loans to Olympia &amp; York, developers of Canary Wharf, knocked share prices of the banks and caused tremors throughout the rest of the market. The selling took its toll of a market that has seemingly run out of steam as the end of the long three-week trading account looms. London was also subdued by the absence of any substantial interest from the Continent, where a number of markets were closed for Ascension Day. The FT-SE Index lost 4.4 at 2,694.2, extending the fall this week to almost 21 points. The day began with the Footsie future leading the cash market sharply lower on the Canary Wharf news, the June contract dropping again to a discount to fair value. Both the futures and the cash market quickly rallied, however, with the Footsie, down almost seven points early in the session, recovering strongly to post a gain of more than eight points by mid-morning. Over lunch, the markets began to wilt afresh, worried by the prospect of yet more bad news from the property arena. The Footsie retreated to show a fall of 9.2 before embarking on a modest late rally, helped by the relatively good showing by Wall Street, which was up eight points as London closed. There was more good news on turnover, with customer business on Wednesday, admittedly boosted by a big programme trade, expanding to Pounds 1.315bn. Turnover yesterday amounted to 520.7m shares. Tesco, the supermarket group, produced the best performance among the Footsie constituents, still responding to switching operations being carried out by leading brokers, involving the sale of cyclical stocks and the purchase of more defensive issues. BAT Industries, the tobacco to insurance group, rose strongly after encouraging remarks by the chairman at the annual meeting. Retailing group Sears also made good progress. On the downside, Taylor Woodrow fell almost 8 per cent, with some large lines of stock said to have been on offer. British Steel was weak after Smith New Court adopted a bearish stance on the shares. Suggestions that next Wednesday's preliminary figures from Siebe may include a rights issue were rejected by dealers, but not before the shares had fallen sharply. British Gas, one of the market's best performers over the past week amid stories that a break-up of the company may be in the offing, turned easier after Moody's Investors Service, the US rating agency, said it was considering downgrading Gas's debt ratings. Vodafone, the cellular radio group, was persistently sold after news that the merger of US groups Sprint and Centel implied lower cellular valuations. Cable and Wireless was hit by disappointing results from its near 60 per cent owned associate Hong Kong Telecom, while oil shares ran out of steam.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by station commentator Chong Pong-kil: </F> "Belligerent Outbursts by Warmongers"]    [Text] From the beginning of the year, the South Korean  warmongers have been running amok in instigating war fever which  is making the situation in our country extremely tense.    According to broadcast reports from Seoul, the joint chiefs  of staff of the puppet defense ministry and the army, navy, and  air force held a so-called ceremony marking the start of the  work for the year on 3 January. Puppet defense minister Yi  Pyong-tae, in the ceremony, raved that the army on the ground,  the navy on the sea, and the air force in the sky should  maintain a strong combat posture in the new year.    The chairman of the puppet joint chiefs of staff vociferated  that the military posture should be rounded off to counter the  North's threat of war and a posture of prompt counteraction  should be established. He, prattling on about the relations of  military cooperation between the United States and South Korea,  enumerated the effective management of the U.S. Forces' rapid  deployment deterrent force and the development of the U.S.-South  Korean joint defense posture. In the ceremony, the puppet army  chief of staff, chief of naval operations, and air force chief  of staff also bellowed bellicose outbursts.    Such belligerent power-reeking outbursts by the heads of the  puppet military circles from the beginning of the year blatantly  reveal their scheme of armed confrontation with us and they are  an intolerable grave challenge to the fellow countrymen who  aspire to peace and reunification of the country.    As it is well known, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song,  stressing in his New Year address that the fatherland's  reunification is the supreme task of our people which must not  be delayed, again clarified that our party and the government of  our Republic will make every effort to reunify the country in  the form of confederation which is based on one nation, one  state, two systems and two governments; on the three principles  of independence, peaceful reunification, and great national  unity.    All the compatriots in the North, South, and overseas, on  hearing the New Year address, fervently support and welcome the  principled stance regarding the fatherland's reunification  clarified by the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Il-song and  turn out in a struggle to implement it, saying that it is a  programmatic guideline that breaks a deadlock lying in the way  of the reunification and peacefully expedites the cause of the  country's reunification by means of the nation's independent  strength.    The South Korean warmongers clique, however, gathered in one  place, hatched the war conspiracy and enumerated provocative  outbursts. These facts clearly prove that the South Korean  puppets are anti-dialogue, anti-reunification elements who have  no will to work for peace and reunification.    What cannot be overlooked is the fact that the South Korean  puppets are prattling on about military cooperation with outside  forces instead of exerting their efforts to end the country's  division in order to achieve national reconciliation and unity.  In fact, the rascals are attempting to keep the U.S. Forces in  South Korea forever and collude with them to provoke war aimed  at northward invasion against their fellow countrymen.    Last year, the South Korean puppets--ignoring the 10-point  program of the great unity of the whole nation which is  acceptable to anyone who wants the country's reunification and  our proposal for peace to exchange special envoys aimed at  discussing and resolving the pending issues between the North  and South--have staged a large scale war exercises almost every  day, including the Team Spirit war exercise--a test nuclear war  and a preliminary war, with the United States and have resorted  to anti-Republic intrigues, vociferating about military  countermeasure.    Puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam, wandering about in units on the  front line dressed in a puppet army uniform, did not hesitate to  commit acts of stirring up war fever. Successive belligerent  outbursts, such as calling for a posture of prompt  counteraction, enumerated by the South Korean warmongers clique  from the beginning of the year are done in the projected line of  such anti-Republic intrigues.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's insidious acts of  deliberately straining the situation and continuously taking the  road of northward provocation, challenging all compatriots who  unanimously aspire to peace and reunification of the country,  will never be tolerated. If the rascals continue to go on the  road of war aimed at northward invasion in the new year, they  will not be safe. We will control the fire with fire and give a  strict punishment to the provokers.    The South Korean puppets must stop behaving rashly, clearly  realizing that their acts of pushing the situation on the Korean  peninsula to an acute phase of confrontation will only result in  their own self-destruction. They should better take the road of  great national unity and reunification in conformity with the  aspiration and demand of compatriots.</p>

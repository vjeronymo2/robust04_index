			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Arab divisions come into open OPPOSITION to a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians yesterday started to crystallise around extremist Islamic fundamentalist groups and Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, writes Julian Ozanne in Jerusalem. However, fears of a strong challenge from the Israeli right wing appeared to be diminishing yesterday as opposition Likud party officials expressed concern about divisions on the right, financial problems and a lack of public response to protest calls. Among Palestinians it became clearer that strong opposition to the deal is felt in areas of the West Bank, such as Ramallah and Jenin, which will have a lesser form of self rule than the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho. An opinion poll of 750 Palestinians published in yesterday's East Jerusalem Arabic newspaper Al-Nahar showed a slim majority of 52.8 per cent in favour of the accord, with over 41 per cent against. In Gaza and Jericho, support for the agreement was more than 70 per cent but almost three-quarters of those interviewed in Ramallah and Jenin were against the peace deal. Mr Faisal Husseini, a leading Palestinian political figure, continued meeting opposition movements yesterday to plead against violent action. However, it was clear that fundamentalist Islamic groups such as Hamas and Jihad Islamiya in alliance with splinter factions of the PLO were determined to wreck a deal they label as 'treachery'.</p>

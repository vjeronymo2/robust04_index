			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / The battle of the breadline: Hanson's Pounds 780m bid for RHM is the biggest threat the food group has faced, say Guy de Jonquieres and Maggie Urry Mr Stanley Metcalfe, chairman of RHM, the baking and grocery group, has a reputation as one of the great survivors of Britain's food industry. He has not only enjoyed an exceptionally long innings at the top of his company - eight years as managing director and three as chairman - but since 1988 has twice successfully defended it against predators. However, yesterday's Pounds 780m bid for RHM by Hanson lands Mr Metcalfe with the challenge of his career. A well-financed conglomerate with a fearsome talent for acquisition, Hanson looks a far more formidable adversary than Goodman Fielder Wattie, the Australian food group which bid for RHM in 1988, or the short-lived consortium headed by Sir James Goldsmith which became RHM's biggest shareholder a year later. Equally important, RHM appears far more vulnerable today. While it could boast in 1988 that its profits growth in the previous five years had outstripped the rest of the food industry, its recent performance has deteriorated alarmingly. Pre-tax profits fell 36 per cent in the first half, and industry observers expect a full-year result of less than Pounds 100m, well down on last year's Pounds 150.2m. This record has sorely tried the patience of RHM's shareholders, who barely four years ago were staring at a 465p per share offer by Goodman Fielder which valued their company at Pounds 1.73bn. Nor has Mr Metcalfe's attitude to investor relations endeared him to the City of London, where he is widely viewed as aloof and uncommunicative. His recent efforts to secure investor loyalty have relied heavily on a determination to hold RHM's dividend. More fundamentally, industry experts have faulted RHM for lacking clear strategic vision and direction. Though Mr Metcalfe is praised for shaking up RHM in the early 1980s, shedding peripheral activities and investing in efficient manufacturing, critics argue that he has since taken his eye off the ball. Though his efforts to expand beyond milling and baking have reduced the latter to about 40 per cent of total turnover, diversification has brought mixed results. Some acquisitions, notably the Pounds 281m purchase of Avana foods in 1987, have been disappointing, as has RHM's involvement in the US. The sternest criticism, though, is that since Goodman Fielder first took a stake in RHM in 1986, top management has spent too much time worrying about insulating itself against the risk of takeover. 'They have concentrated too much on the share price and not enough on strengthening the long-term position of the business,' says Mr David Lang, industry analyst with stockbrokers Henderson Crosthwaite. Given RHM's signal failure to keep its share price up, few in the City were surprised by yesterday's bid. Indeed, the company is rumoured to have been hawked around the food industry as a potential target for several weeks. Nonetheless, it is not certain that Hanson will have a clear run. Though its offer of 220p a share is 45p above the price at which RHM shares closed on Friday, it falls some way short of the company's break-up value, which some in the City put at Pounds 900m to Pounds 1bn. Much of this lies in RHM's collection of small but desirable grocery brands, which were valued on its balance sheet at Pounds 608m in August last year. It is possible, therefore, that RHM could yet attract a counter-bidder or find a white knight. However, its quest a couple of years ago for a friendly merger partner came to nothing - at least partly because of anxieties about its troubled bread-baking business. Indeed, since a bread price war broke out three years ago, savaging RHM's profits, this part of the business has been widely considered the company's most effective poison pill. Hanson's readiness to take on the challenge of running it is, accordingly, its strongest trump card. RHM is Britain's second-largest baker after Associated British Foods. In the past decade, it has radically overhauled its operations, replacing 65 small, elderly bakeries with 18 efficient high-capacity plants. It also saved money by replacing a fragmented local distribution system with an integrated national one, anticipating the emerging needs of powerful supermarket groups which now dominate bread sales. However, these large investments have not shielded the company from fierce competition from a small band of independent bakers and millers. Operating with lower overheads than RHM and ABF, these privately-owned concerns have aggressively won cut-price business from the big supermarkets, many of which have increasingly treated bread as a loss-leader. At one point last year standard white loaves, the industry's staple product, were on sale for as little as 27p, compared with about 40p in the late 1980s. RHM and ABF have responded by by following prices down in an attempt to hold on to market share. Though their profits have taken a beating, the two companies have reasoned that the only way to restore their control over the market was to eliminate excess capacity by driving their upstart competitors to the wall. Industry experts are divided over their success. Some believe the high margins enjoyed by the industry in the late 1980s will never return. They argue that the supermarkets are now in the driving seat and will ensure that enough independent bakers remain in business to keep the industry leaders permanently off-balance. Others, however, think the market may soon stabilise. ABF is believed to be planning capacity cuts, while a poor northern European harvest is depriving independent bakers and millers of access to the cheap grain which they relied on to produce cut-price bread. Indeed, some in the industry believe there is a good chance of making an imminent price increase stick. If the optimists are right, Hanson will have called the turn in the industry brilliantly. If they are wrong, the company could still improve short-term margins substantially by making the steady capacity cuts which RHM has so far refused to contemplate. Such thinking appears to have contributed to a sharp rise yesterday in the share price of ABF. Though Hanson's talents as a marketing organisation are debatable, its record as a cost-cutter and manager of low-tech manufacturing is widely respected. Bread, a commodity product in long-term decline, could lend itself well to the same type of management approach as Hanson has brought to the tobacco business of Imperial Group, which it acquired in 1986. Since then, the business has doubled its profits. But threats of savage retrenchment at a time of rising unemployment could also play into the hands of RHM, which energetically mobilised political opinion against Goodman Fielder's bid. In any event, the lack of other plausible bidders for RHM's bread division would be likely to leave Hanson lumbered with it for the foreseeable future. The same may not be true, however, of the rest of the business, which consists of a mixture of branded groceries and 'private label' food items sold by supermarkets under their own name. Hanson will not be drawn on its plans. But it has only limited experience of running packaged grocery companies, and sold off the food businesses of Imperial and SCM in the US soon after acquiring them. Its only food-related business today is the Seven Seas vitamin pill and fish oil company. If Hanson decided to sell RHM's food operations, there would be no shortage of takers. Though none of the businesses is a mega-brand, and some have suffered from trading down by consumers in the recession, many have established highly profitable niche positions. The head of a competing food manufacturer said recently that he would give his eye teeth for Sharwoods, RHM's sauces and condiments business, while old favourites such as Paxo stuffing and Bisto gravy mixes continue to dominate admittedly mature markets. Mr Kipling's cakes and pastries have also been consistent money spinners. Some critics accuse RHM of not doing enough to support these brands, preferring instead to conserve cash by building up its private label business, which requires minimal investment in product innovation and none in marketing. They also argue that it has been too slow expanding into continental Europe, where it earned only Pounds 73.6m of its Pounds 1.5bn sales last year. It is doubtful how much Hanson would do, if it kept RHM intact, to improve on either of these points. Much more likely, it would choose to realise the value of RHM's brands by auctioning them off to one or several bidders, either in the UK or abroad. In the latter camp, BSN of France, and CPC and Conagra of the US are already being mentioned as potential buyers. Valuing the RHM brands is extremely difficult. Some analysts believe they are overstated in the company's balance sheet because that valuation - highly controversial at the time - was decided in a bull market, when investors and food manufacturers were gripped by an onset of brand frenzy. But much would depend on the nature and ambitions of bidders. The prices paid would be influenced not only by the brands' earning record, but by their potential for expansion in the hands of a new owner. While it is hard to imagine that there would be much demand outside Britain for Paxo or Bisto, Mr Kipling might find a wider market in continental Europe. However, the main appeal of RHM's brands is that they could expand the operations of a UK competitor or offer an entree into the British market for a foreign company. In recent years, the huge marketing costs involved in establishing brands from scratch have made acquisitions an increasingly attractive option. However, a wave of takeovers in the UK food industry has taken many attractive companies off the market in the past few years. Of the larger ones which remain independent, only Allied Lyons, Cadbury Schweppes and United Biscuits still command strong brands and market position. Of those which remain, many are struggling in low-margin commodity businesses or are paying the price for over-expansion in the 1980s. For these reasons, the progress of Hanson's battle for RHM will be followed with close attention by acquisition-minded food companies in the UK and abroad. But by the same token, it seems unlikely to signal the start of another big round of takeovers in the industry.</p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Standard deflects bid talk BANKING group Standard Chartered sought to deflect swirling takeover speculation as its shares outpaced the market to add a net 28 at 630p by the close of trading. Gossip mongers had it that Lloyds Bank might be preparing an offer for the bank that is now benefiting from its exposure to the Pacific rim boom. There was also alternative talk that Lloyds might have placed a large block of shares at a premium to the underlying price. However, Standard said the rise followed a dinner on Tuesday night hosted by the US investment bank Goldman Sachs. Institutional clients met the bank's chief executive Mr Malcolm Williamson and apparently left reassured. A bank spokesman said yesterday: 'There has been some buying that was initiated from the sentiment at the meeting.' There have been rumours for some time that Lloyds is seeking to make a bid within the banking sector but most analysts believe it is still licking its wounds following the failure to acquire Midland. Banking specialists added that Standard shares were already at a 50 per cent premium to asset value when trading started yesterday and offered a very expensive way in. Lloyds closed unchanged at 499p. Barclays dividend hopes A 'coincidence of buy recommendations' on Barclays, based on growing confidence that the bank will hold its dividend, gave a lift to the shares. The strength was helped by a shortage of stock in early trading and Barclays rose 19 to 397p on heavy turnover of 8.6m shares. Hoare Govett, NatWest Securities and agency broker James Capel were all recommending Barclays yesterday arguing that in spite of anticipated heavy provisions for bad debts the bank will pay a 21.2p dividend when it announces full-year results on March 4. Hoare Govett was advising clients to switch from NatWest saying its share price was at an unnecessarily big discount to Barclays. However, the general shift of perception in the sector boosted by news of a recovery in Citicorp's fortunes ensured that NatWest rose 10 to 415p. Rank Xerox speculation Further consideration of this week's restructuring decision by Xerox sent Rank Organisation sharply forward as speculation mounted over the prospects for the US group to buy Rank's share of their Rank Xerox joint venture. On present multiples, Xerox might be expected to pay in excess of Pounds 800m for the 50 per cent stake, a sum which would go a long way to satisfying Rank's critics worried over the group's large debt burden of Pounds 999m. Such concerns have meant Rank has regularly been fingered as a potential rights issue candidate and undermined the shares performance. Most analysts cautioned that Xerox's decision to quit the financial services business would be costly and that any decision on Rank Xerox was some time off. However, market anxiety about the UK leisure group's debt levels may be eased by such a prospect on the horizon. Analysts also expressed concern about the capital gains tax that would be levied on the deal. Rank shares, helped also by investors buying ahead of the dividend, advanced 13 to 714p in busy turnover of 1.1m. Reuters weakened News wire and electronic dealing group Reuters retreated as investment bank BZW issued a sell recommendation ahead of the figures on February 9. While BZW's Mr Paul Norris liked the company's fundamental position, he argued that revenue growth will only be 5 per cent in the coming year, adding: 'On our price Reuters is the second most expensive stock in the Footsie after Rentokil.' He expects profits of Pounds 380m for 1992 and Pounds 425m for 1993. The 1993 figure is at the low end of the range of analysts' forecasts. Reuters shares closed 19 lower at 1354p and Mr Norris believes they are not worth buying until they fall below 1300p. Insurance group Commercial Union rose 7 as a weighty piece of enthusiastic research from Smith New Court landed on clients' desks. The 100-page overview argued that investors were under-estimating the strength of the life insurance business and the success of CU's UK expansion. Smiths has raised its 1994 forecast by Pounds 50m to around Pounds 300m and believes the share price should reach 750p within the next year. The presentation of new business figures from Legal &amp; General prompted the shares to rise 10 on the claim that the headline figure had risen by 57 per cent. However, analysts said that ignoring 'innovative accounting' the figure was significantly down, and on consideration, the shares fell back to close only 2 better at 433p. Drinks stocks constituted the worst performing sector in the market as a worrying trading statement and technical factors combined to depress shares. Bear raiders were in evidence again in Allied Lyons as rights issue stories re-surfaced. Although the stories were discounted by the company, the shares lost ground, closing 12 adrift at 590p. A pessimistic trading statement from Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley took 5 off the shares to 565p and pulled Whitbread back sharply, off 12 at 452p. Regional brewers were also weakened by government hints that rules on licence applications would be relaxed, opening the prospect of more competition. After its recent mauling, Bass recovered on late betting considerations and advanced 3 to 582p. Global advertising and marketing services group WPP saw its share price jump 10 per cent after SG Warburg Securities published a comprehensive buy note on the stock. The analysis argues that the shares are trading on a multiple of only 10.3 times 1993 earnings compared with a sector rating of almost 15 times. On this basis, the house believes the shares would be more fairly valued at 87p. Yesterday they lifted 6 to 66p. Vodafone rose following reports that the cellular market may be undermined by lower-priced mobile rivals. The shares tumbled 19 to 388p in bulky turnover of 6.8m. Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo fell further on talk that it might be interested in a bid for US group Warner Lambert. However, the shares recovered with the market to close a penny better at 702p. Initial disappointment at yesterday's retail sales figures evaporated as the details revealed better news from the larger high street stores. Argos rose 14 to 279p, Body Shop 1 to 144p, Dixons 8 to 233p and Marks and Spencer 5 to 317p. Positive news leaked from an analysts visit to Unigate and the shares gained 6 to 330p. Unilever continued to benefit from its upbeat trading message to analysts this week and the shares added 8 to 1096p. Disappointing results from Resort Hotels left the shares 2 shy at 40p. Betting stocks benefited again from the government's decision to allow late summer opening hours. Brent Walker added 1 3/4 to 10 1/2 p, Ladbroke 4 to 189p and Stanley Leisure a muted 3 to 177p. A profits warning from Wembley sent the shares 2 1/2 lower at 17p. The market continued to be cheered by confirmation of the Taiwan Aerospace deal with British Aerospace and the shares broke through the 200p barrier to close up 8 at 202p, in trade of 6m. Among other engineering stocks, IMI gave up 2 to 252p following a Smith New Court sell recommendation. Smith said the advice was because, 'the rate of growth at the company will be below the average for the engineering sector in 1993.' The market continued to appreciate plans by British Steel to raise prices on some of its main products. The shares added 4 to 64 1/2 p, in brisk business of 10m which included a trade of 3m done at 62 1/2 , with a sizeable part of the demand said to have come from the US. Investors took a court ruling in the US concerning asbestos claims to be good news for T &amp; N. The shares gained 5 to 177p, with sentiment boosted by a buy recommendation from Carr Kitcat. The agency broker advised investors to switch into T &amp; N and GKN, 2 better at 255p, and out of BBA and Laird Group, a penny off at 158p and 2 lighter at 291p respectively.

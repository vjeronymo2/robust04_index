			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Favaris Davietjarov, vice president of the </F> Russian Rosnef company, by Borja Loma in Asuncion; date not  given -- all names and titles as published]    [Text] [Loma] Please tell us why the Rosnef company has  come to Paraguay?    [Davietjarov] I would like to say first that Paraguay is for  us a new country. Our company is working in nearly every  country in the world, except Paraguay. Second, we always  thought Paraguay was a dictatorship like Russia was. We now  know you are on the road to democracy and as we understand it,  your government seeks to give the Paraguayan people a better, a  more dignified life. This is what we want for our own people: a  dignified life for all. You must know that Russia is one of the  largest oil exporters in the world, but because some of our oil  has run out, we have people looking for oil in different places.  This is why we thought there may be oil in Paraguay.    [Loma] You know the Americans are already here looking for  oil.    [Davietjarov] We know the Americans are looking for oil in  Paraguay. We want to know what is happening here. We want to  know exactly what the possibilities are here. This is our first  contact. We also want to know about the relations you have with  other oil companies. After that we will know what to do. This  is only the start. We can be a good competitors for the  Americans. We have good experts. Not everything that is  American is necessarily better, especially regarding the first  stages of prospecting for oil. We are the best at that.    [Loma] What is the role of Rosnef in the Russian economy?    [Davietjarov] Rosnef controls 70 percent of the Russian oil  market, 65 percent of byproducts, and 65 percent of the sale of  oil fields in the country. From the Russian map, you can see we  control over 70 percent of the oil territory. It is a company  that has more than 1 million workers [as published]. It  controls over 55 percent of the oil business in Russia. I am  the vice president of the consortium that used to belong to the  state, which is now in the process of privatization. This  process will conclude late this year.    [Loma] Could you tell us in what Latin American countries  your company has commercial interests?    [Davietjarov] We have been in Cuba for a long time,  supplying  oil. In Venezuela we buy and sell oil. We also worked with  various U.S. companies with interests in Latin America. We buy  machinery and oil extracting equipment.    [Loma] You do not operate in many Latin American countries.    [Davietjarov] We work mostly with the Americans in this  continent, especially with West-coast companies which deliver  oil and byproducts to the East coast of Russia because it is too  far to bring it through the European part of Russia.    [Loma] What is your opinion of the international oil market  following the imbalances created by the Persian Gulf War, and  the fall of the Communist system in your country and in Eastern  Europe?    [Davietjarov] The market collapsed but our exports did not  decrease. They remained at the same level. The international  oil price dropped but this did not influence the Russian market.    [Loma] What role do you believe Paraguay could play in the  international oil market?    [Davietjarov] Paraguay buys oil from Algeria. You must  produce oil in your country if you are to influence the market.  We believe that because Paraguay is located in the heart of  South America it could become a good platform for exchanging  Brazilian oil, for example, with Chile and other countries after  the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] becomes operational.  A big oil refinery could be built here to produce oil  byproducts for neighboring countries. We met yesterday with  Integration Vice Minister Fadlala and saw many positive points  in the program he showed us. Paraguay can play a major role in  the Mercosur even if no oil is found here.    [Loma] Will you look for oil here?    [Davietjarov] No, but we are ready.    [Loma] Ready, for what?    [Davietjarov] To meet with the minister and discuss the  problems and possibilities. We will then make our offer.    [Loma] This delegation seems to be the most important to  have  arrived in the history of bilateral relations. Does this  represent greater rapprochement between the two governments?    [Davietjarov] Our government program consists of maintaining  good relations with all countries as well as integrating into  the world and working in any country. We are not here only to  carry out propaganda in our favor but also to learn. We have to  learn the good things existing abroad. It would be a great  pleasure for us to learn many things in Paraguay.    [Loma] During your first news conference, as soon as you  arrived, you noted that you did not know much about Paraguay,  but you would be interested in obtaining more information with  the goal of establishing commercial channels. Have you learned  anything significant yet?    [Davietjarov] This is the first time that we are meeting and  become acquainted with the people here -- not only at the  ministries, but also on the streets where we have talked with  various pedestrians. We are becoming acquainted with the city  and everything is going step by step. If you only meet  ministers, you do not get much information. It is necessary to  become acquainted with the people, and we are doing just that.    [Loma] Can you tell me if you have signed any political or  economic agreement?    [Davietjarov] We have been here for a very short time. We  have held and we will hold many meetings. We have presented our  offers. I can only tell you again that we are ready. We hope  our offers will be interesting for Paraguayan entrepreneurs and  businessmen. We are ready to sign agreements. We have more than  1 million people working in our consortium. We are sure some  Paraguayan products will be of interest in Russia or at least  for your consortium.    [Loma] According to assessments by various international  observers, the political situation in Paraguay is not entirely  stable at this moment. What would your enterprise do if the  democratic process were discontinued here?    [Davietjarov] We are interested in good relations,  especially  economic ones, which should take place within an atmosphere of  political stability. Nevertheless, I am sure that we, like any  foreign company established here, can work well under any  political system. Business is business.    [Loma] What was your perception of Paraguay while you were  in  Russia? What is the Russian people's perception of Paraguay?    [Davietjarov] In our encyclopedias we have accurate  information on Paraguay. From the newspapers, I had a factual  report that the political system had changed and that the  country was on its way to democracy. I am mentally blending  this data with what I now see here for myself. We hope that  democracy will continue in Paraguay.    [Loma] Let us now discuss your country's domestic  situation. The IMF has admitted that your program of reforms is  too risky and did not take into account, or took very little  into account, the social cost, which is very high. Do you agree?    [Davietjarov] I can only give your my personal opinion. Our  people, rich or poor, will not back down. Everyone in our  country dreams of liberty. We say in Russia that bread alone is  not enough to live on. Our people are beginning to enjoy  liberty and do not want to lose it. Not just liberty, but also  the privatization program, which is going very fast. For  example, the privatization of the oil industry. Some 25 percent  of our enterprise has been offered to the workers, completely  free of charge. Another 15 percent has been offered to them,  allowing them to purchase shares over three years without paying  any interest. These special measures have been exclusively  implemented in the Russian oil industry. Because our enterprise  is taking the initial steps toward privatization, the majority  of stock must remain in the hands of the government. The  complete process will take about three years. I believe this is  the appropriate way to do things. This is the general  situation. Most people support the government in the  implementation of the program of reforms.    [Loma] President Yeltsin has just replaced the economy  minister, who was very radical, by someone who is more  conservative, seeking to reduce the pace of reforms. Do you  believe this is a timely change?    [Davietjarov] I personally know the new economy minister and  can say that he is in favor of a market economy. Unlike you, I  do not believe this change of ministers necessarily means a  slower pace toward a market economy. There is another, more  simple explanation for this change of ministers. When you are  heading for an unknown location, you must first go slowly, but  on other occasions you must go at full speed. I can tell you  that our government program will not radically change. We have  a new parliament in which there are many economists. I am sure  that their decisions will be correct. Our people understand  perfectly that problems always occur during changes of this  magnitude.    [Loma] What is your personal opinion of Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy  and on the great success he achieved in the past elections.    [Davietjarov] I am personally sure, very sure, that Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy will never be our country's president.    [Loma] Why not?    [Davietjarov] Because he totally lost the success he  achieved  in the elections following his remarks and visits to various  foreign countries. The Russian people now know him well. I  believe Vladimir Zhirinovskiy should stop considering himself  the future president of Russia.    [Loma] What is your personal opinion on Russia's current  situation? Do you believe the West has abandoned you in a sense?    [Davietjarov] My personal opinion is that Russia, alone,  must  be able to succeed. We have great scientists and intellectuals.  The country can succeed alone and overcome this difficult  situation. If the West moves away, it will return sooner or  later. It is not a problem. (he laughs)    [Loma] Would you like to add anything for the Paraguayan  people? What would you like to tell the Paraguayan people from  the Russian people?    [Davietjarov] No one in my country has given me the right to  speak in his or her name. Nevertheless, as an ordinary Russian  citizen, I hope you will continue on this democratic path and  have good relations with all countries, including Russia. Our  people work hard and, according to what I have seen so far,  Paraguayans also work hard. We have something in common. I  hope Paraguay will be modernized as we are being modernized.</p>

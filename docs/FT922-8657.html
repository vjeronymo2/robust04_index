			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Quarter of British Rail routes fail timetable targets A QUARTER of all rail routes in Britain are failing to meet punctuality targets set under the British Rail Passenger's Charter. Users of the worst lines, however, will not qualify for compensation unless the poor performance continues until the end of the year. Figures published by BR yesterday are the first to show its performance against targets on a line-by-line basis since the Passenger's Charter was launched two months ago. The worst route for punctuality has been Network SouthEast's London-Kent coast line, on which only 73.2 per cent of peak-hour trains reached their destination less than five minutes late. The target for the line is 83.3 per cent. For cancellations, equal worst are Network SouthEast's London-Tilbury and Southend line and Regional Railways' north-east lines, both of which ran 96.6 per cent of scheduled trains. The target throughout BR is 99 per cent. One surprise is the particularly poor performance of the InterCity sector, customarily portrayed by BR as the jewel in its crown. All but two of InterCity's seven routes fell short of punctuality targets, some widely. Of the two lines that did pass the punctuality test, one - the Gatwick Express  -failed on reliability. The best line in Britain appears to be Regional Railways' North Wales line, which scored 98.2 per cent on punctuality and 99.7 per cent on reliability. InterCity's best performer is the Great Western route from London Paddington. Network SouthEast's leader is London Euston-Northampton. Under the charter, regular rail users will receive discounts on season ticket renewals if their lines fail to meet performance targets by more than a narrow margin over a 12-month period. However, monitoring began only in January, so BR can avoid discounts if it brings performance up to par by year end. BR said yesterday that although 11 of its 44 routes had failed to meet punctuality targets, only seven of the lines were performing badly enough to trigger discounts if they failed to improve.

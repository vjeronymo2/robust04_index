			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Training body 'in low gear' INVESTORS IN PEOPLE, the government's main tool for improving the training of people in work, is 'still in low gear', Training and Enterprise Councils told a Commons select committee yesterday. Representatives of Tecs, which administer publicly funded training programmes in England and Wales, along with a range of other initiatives including IIP, were giving evidence to the select committee on employment. Written evidence drawn from the 82 Tecs, presented to the committee, said that IIP was a key tool in aiding business performance. But it said: 'There is some concern over the national profile and backing and the resource dedicated to the initiative is small. It is still in low gear.' Tecs until this year had no special funds for the initiative which seeks to assess the quality of training within companies. Tecs also said in the written evidence that for most companies the national education and training targets - set by the Confederation of British Industry and endorsed by government - were a 'remote and unrecognised part of some national agenda'. The targets - which set dates for the acquisition of the new national vocational qualifications  - needed a much higher national profile, the Tecs said. Mr Ken Eastham, Labour MP for Blackley, asked Tec representatives whether they were concerned over providers of training, in particular cash-strapped local authorities, withdrawing from providing places for individuals on Youth Training. Mr Edward Roberts, chairman of G10, which represents Tecs to government, said: 'It is a worrying situation.' In the written evidence, Tecs expressed concern over reduced unit prices for Youth Training and Employment Training, the scheme for the adult long-term unemployed. It said: 'The concern is that both both YT and ET are headed for a low skill, low quality, low expectation, low take-up and low prestige aid of last resort position.'</p>

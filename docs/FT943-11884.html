			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Bus group forced into price pledge Stagecoach Holdings, the bus company, has been required to give two sets of undertakings about its conduct, it emerged yesterday. Sussex Coastline Buses, part of the Stagecoach group, has given undertakings to limit fare rises and maintain the frequency of service on two bus routes in Bognor Regis after a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report found it had acted anti-competitively. Stagecoach Holdings has already clashed with the competition authorities this year. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said yesterday he had accepted the undertakings from Sussex Coastline, formerly Southdown Motor Services, to remedy the adverse affect on competition of its actions. An MMC report published in June 1993 found that Southdown had charged uneconomic fares on two routes in Bognor Regis to undermine services operated by Easy Rider Minicoaches. Easy Rider subsequently withdrew from Bognor Regis. The undertakings will apply until March 17 next year. In a second development, Stagecoach Holdings has given undertakings about its behaviour when tendering for bus routes following its acquisition in 1989 of Formia, holding company of the Hastings and District bus company. Mr Brian Cox, managing director of Stagecoach South, said: 'We are growing and this sort of thing happens. These undertakings are not at all onerous but we have no intention of doing any of the things they were anxious about.' Earlier this year, Fife Scottish Omnibuses, a Stagecoach Holdings subsidiary, gave undertakings about its good conduct after an OFT investigation found it had tried to remove a competitor from the market. Stagecoach Holdings is still discussing with the OFT the undertakings it should give after its acquisition of Lancaster City Transport was judged to be against the public interest. Stagecoach Holdings, which has made five acquisitions in the past 15 months, yesterday announced a 46 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 18.9m in the year ending in April.</p>

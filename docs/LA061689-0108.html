			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUNMAN'S RAMPAGE LEAVES 1 WOMAN DEAD, 2 WOUNDED  </P> <P> The rampage began about 12:10 a.m. Thursday in a parking lot in Rowland  Heights, where 39-year-old Leslie Benevides is said to have been talking with a  woman.  </P> <P> Benevides suddenly shot the woman -- believed to be his girlfriend -- leaving  her in critical condition, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said.  </P> <P> Then, investigators said, Benevides drove to a nearby home, where he shot two  more women, killing one and critically wounding the other.  </P> <P> About an hour later, deputies said, they found Benevides -- owner of a small  trash-collection business in the Hacienda Heights area -- passed out in a back  yard lawn chair at the Artesia home of a former girlfriend after she called to  report a prowler.  </P> <P> Investigators said that while Benevides "has a history of drug abuse and  violent behavior," they know of no motives for the attacks.  </P> <P> However, the former girlfriend told a reporter that Benevides had threatened  her life when they broke up in December and she believes that she was next on  his list Thursday morning.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Too Scared to Talk  </P> <P> The woman, who asked not to be named, said she was "extremely afraid of both  Leslie and his friends" -- too scared to talk about it.  </P> <P> "If I could tell you the things I knew," she began, before lapsing into  silence.  </P> <P> Another acquaintance of Benevides said more.  </P> <P> "He was real jealous about women, and he could get mad real easy," said Robert  Crasco, 18, who worked for Benevides' trash business for several years.  </P> <P> "I don't figure him shooting nice people like that," Crasco said. "But when  he's drinking, he can be pretty mean."  </P> <P> The dead woman was identified as Maxine Vance, 34. The other woman shot at the  Vance home -- Bobby Stoddard, 18 -- underwent surgery at Whittier Presbyterian  Intercommunity Hospital.  </P> <P> The woman shot in the parking lot, whose identity was not released, was in the  intensive care unit Thursday at Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina.  </P> <P> Homicide detectives said that, according to witnesses, Benevides had been  talking to the woman in the lot at Colima Road and Azusa Avenue when he fired a  single shot from a rifle. The woman was struck in the head and collapsed on the  pavement as Benevides fled in his car.  </P> <P> About five minutes after the shooting, Crasco drove by the Vance home in the  1400 block of Greencastle Avenue and noticed Benevides' car in the driveway.  </P> <P> "I didn't think anything of it, because Les is a friend of Maxine's husband,  Jerry," Crasco said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unaware of Visitors  </P> <P> Crasco said he was unaware at the time that there were two other visitors in  the Vance home -- Stoddard, who had been the subject of Benevides' advances in  the past, and Billy Brownlee, Stoddard's boyfriend.  </P> <P> Crasco said he was watching television at his home, two houses away, about 15  minutes later, when Brownlee, who had been asleep in a back bedroom at the  Vance home, dashed in the front door to say that two people had been shot.  </P> <P> "We ran back over there, and there was Maxine, lying on the couch . . . shot in  the head," Crasco said. "Bobby was on the couch, too, shot in the chest and the  mouth. . . . Bobby was moaning. Maxine was quiet. . . ."  </P> <P> Crasco said he called sheriff's deputies, and they, in turn, called for  ambulances.  </P> <P> Deputy Van Mosely said that although Stoddard was unable to speak, she wrote  Benevides' name on a piece of paper before undergoing surgery.  </P> <P> Several hours later, the former girlfriend in Artesia, who described her  relationship with Benevides as a long and bitter one, heard a knock on the  front door of her home in the 11600 block of East 186th Street. She said she  got up, looked through the peep hole and saw only a shadow.  </P> <P> "Thank God he ducked," she said. "If I'd known it was him, I'd have opened the  door."  </P> <P> Frightened by the shadow at the door, the woman called sheriff's deputies.  </P> <P> The deputies said they found Benevides unconscious in the woman's back yard.  His battered trash truck, parked nearby, contained the 9-millimeter rifle  believed used in the shootings, officers said.  </P> <P> A radio check revealed that Benevides was being sought in the Rowland Heights  attacks. He was booked at the sheriff's Lakewood station on suspicion of murder  and jailed without bail.  </P></p>

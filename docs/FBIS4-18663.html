			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Guenther Gillessen: "The Bundeswehr Budget Is </F> Being Plundered; There Is No Money for Exercises, Training, and  Maintenance"]    [Text] Hildesheim, 6 April -- No other detail in the  defense commissioner's report has received so much attention as  the remark that in one training company the firing of a shot had  to be simulated with "bang" and an explosion with "whoom,"  because there was a lack of practice ammunition. Recently, more  signs than "bang" and "whoom" have demonstrated that the  Bundeswehr is underfinanced. The structure, consisting of size,  assignment, and funds, is now breaking up. The long-term  investment plan for the army, designed for the 15 years up to  the year 2007, has now been cut by 24 billion German marks [DM]  (of DM56 billion). This makes impossible not only the renewal  of some of the equipment, but also the procurement of entirely  new weapons systems. The cuts affect the navy and the air force  in a similar way.    The defense budget has now been cut in the last three years.  In February of this year, it was reduced once more by DM1.25  billion. The annual investment and procurement quota used to  stand at 27-29 percent in the past. After the cuts of  1992-1994, is has now plummeted to about 20 percent. At the  level of the army, the renewal rate was even halved. After  DM5.6 billion (1990), only DM2.4 billion have been made  available this year for procurement and the modernization of  facilities (barracks).  <H5>  No Experience in Use of Major Items of Equipment </H5>   Right now there is already a appalling lack of funds for  exercises on training grounds: no money for rail transport,  practice ammunition, gasoline, maintenance and spare parts, and  no money for keeping conscripts as volunteers after their  compulsory service and for exercise days for reservists. Worst  hit are units that have to use major items of equipment, that is  to say tank units, artillery, army aviation units, engineers.  Training in such units requires experience in moving such large  equipment most of all.    As far as engineers are concerned, funds have been cut for  maintaining their construction machinery in civilian workshops.  When a large part of the machinery can now no longer be  maintained and has to be put out of service and people can be  trained only with the help of the remaining machinery, then  training has to be reduced. Engineers are still acquiring the  licenses necessary for operating such machines, but they no  longer acquire the experience for safe handling. The effects  can be easily foreseen: The personal risk to the soldiers and  the rate of damage to machines as a result of operating mistakes  will increase. An absolute ban is currently in force on the  building of temporary bridges to prevent certain components from  wearing away, as they can only be replaced in two years.    In the army aviation units, the number of flying hours for  liaison helicopters has been cut by more than half, from 62,700  flying hours in 1987 to 27,800 in 1994, and for transport  helicopters by 10 percent (from 55,650 to 49,800 hours). This  is making it more difficult for the commanders of the major  units to supervise their troops in garrisons that are dispersed  over a larger area during practices. The safety of the aviation  services is also affected if it is no longer possible to keep a  sufficient number of pilots adequately trained.    In talks with commanders of the 21st Tank Brigade  (Augustdorf) and the 1st Armored Infantry Brigade, with many of  their battalion commanders, heads of company and batteries, one  can learn of the distress that is now prevailing in the army, an  impression that is shared by most of them. The "crisis reaction  forces" (KRK) that can be quickly mobilized are slightly better  off than the "main defense forces" (HVK). The 21st Tank Brigade  of Augustdorf belongs to the first category, the 1st Armored  Infantry Brigade (Hildesheim) to the second.    The budget item that is most important for the combat  training of forces is funding for staying at training areas.  This includes mainly practice ammunition, the cost of the rail  transport of heavy arms, and the per diem allowance for the  soldiers, referred to as "bush money" in the military jargon.  The 21st Tank Brigade was allotted DM1.06 billion in "bush  money" in 1992, while DM2.3 billion was provided for the rail  transport of tracked vehicles to Bergen-Hohne. The rail  transport of a single tank company on this track stands at  DM130,000. So the funds only allow one transport of tanks,  armored vehicles, and mortars for 15 companies and batteries.  These funds permit two practices a year on the training area if  one unit moves its tracked vehicles by rail and another takes  them over at the training area and returns them to barracks at  the end of the practice.    KRK units are allowed up to 30 days of practice a year,  while HVK units can have no more than 25 now. Taking into  account the time for shifting everything to the training areas  and returning, the cancellation of practices involving heavy  ammunition at weekends, and the cleaning of vehicles, only about  25 days are actually left for the KRK forces and 20 for the HVK  units. In the past, 30 days on the training area were regarded  as the minimum for training, while now it is the maximum.  Combat forces used to practice by the battalion, while now they  only do so only in companies, and, in practice, only at the  level of platoons, because one part of the company always has to  act as the enemy. Thus, the individual soldier hardly ever  experiences his own company as a combat unit, let alone the  entire battalion.    In the past, there were 64 rounds of large-caliber practice  ammunition for each gun barrel per year for combat tanks and  artillery. Three years ago this was reduced to 44 units. Now  it is only 30. Practicing with heavy mortars at the training  area but then only being able to fire a maximum of two shots on  a long day of training is demoralizing for the soldiers.  "What," the gunner asks his commander, and the commander the  battery head, "is the point of going to all the trouble of  transferring everything to the training area, putting up the  mortars, adjusting them, continually repeating identical aiming  exercises with the gun or in the fire direction center -- what  is the good of all the changes in position, when a single shot  should be the `reward' of a whole day on the terrain?"    Soldiers must -- at least once, as the climax of their  combat  training -- see actual shooting and be able to hear the noise.  They must be able to experience what they can do with their  weapons and what effect these can have in a unit, also together  with other arms. One does not have to describe that as "weapon  proud." Yet, soldiers need trust and confidence in their own  equipment and their own unit as a group and community to  survive. They want to be challenged, but they also want to  learn that they can do what they are asked to. It is such stuff  that the troop's "morale" is made off. The cuts are undermining  it.    Night operations training no longer exists in the army  because there is hardly any pyrotechnical ammunition for light  signals and the lighting of the combat area. One signal  cartridge costs about DM2.30 -- but money is short. The same  applies to low-altitude air defense at the level of all forces.  In almost all special training, individual elements that do not  belong to the essence of the training of the individual unit  have to be left out. Commanders say that the main targets of  training of recruits are still being achieved, yet the  instructors disagree, and say that the army's resources were  being drained.    Simulators help save training costs. Marksmanship training  on the simulator in front of moving images on video films with  combat noises is effective to a certain extent, because any  decision or action taken by the soldiers is documented and can  be discussed immediately afterwards. The objective of tank  firing exercises and combat training is to recognize the enemy  at an early stage, to fight him within 10 seconds, and to  achieve an average score of 90 percent. Practice is everything.  The first shot must count, and do so quickly, because otherwise  the enemy is faster. Training on the simulator helps to save  ammunition, gasoline, and wear and tear. Yet, it remains a  solitary video game in a cell and cannot replace being in a real  vehicle on the training area, the frictions and the experience  of cooperation with others. It all boils down to the following:  Training protects the soldier, training is the superior's  obligation. Yet the ultimate superiors of the soldiers sit in  parliament and do not see the consequences of restricted  training.  <H5>  Borrowing Is Inevitable </H5>   To have heavy arms such as tanks and mortars on training  areas and to have them used by several units to save transport  costs makes sense. On the tank firing range at Castlemartin in  Wales and on the Shilo training ground in Canada this is an old  tradition. Yet it requires a maintenance unit on location as  well as logistical organization.    Still, at home, it would probably be more expensive to keep  all kinds of equipment in larger numbers and in all versions  (for example three series of "Marder" combat vehicles) and the  necessary repair units permanently on the exercise areas. On  domestic grounds it is cheaper to have the equipment of one unit  subsequently used by only one other unit of the same battalion  and then returned.    Yet, since this practice was introduced, the rate of damage  has significantly increased. After all, nobody takes as much  care of what belongs to others -- the familiar weakness of  socialism. No vehicle is as perfectly maintained as one's own.  If a soldier returns another's tank after the practice  something will "certainly" be damaged. (After a few days on the  training area something will always be damaged.) The damage  caused by someone else to "his" equipment would "certainly" not  have happened to him. It upsets him and cannot be ignored.    The forced borrowing of large items of equipment causes  exceptional frustration among the troops, and that is something  that one hears again and again from every sergeant. It does  indeed matter whether a vehicle is being driven below full  capacity by someone who knows its "quirks" or by someone else  who either cannot use its true potential (the conclusion is that  the equipment "is not up to much" or causes damage (then the  conclusion is that the weapons system is not up to anything).  Borrowing undermines responsibility for and confidence in  equipment. Economizing on transportation costs markedly more  than maintenance.    Funds for maintenance have also been reduced. In the past,  to economize, the Bundeswehr gave up a maintenance service of  its own. In its origins, the Bundeswehr is no expeditionary  force and has a network of civilian bases in its own country.  Large repairs to normal commercial vehicles are awarded to  civilian firms. Funds for such repairs in particular have  become scarce, which is, for example, the case at the 12th  Armored Infantry Battalion in Osterrode am Harz. The commander  has requested DM80,000 for maintenance in 1994. It is assumed  that DM55,000 will be approved, that is, 30 percent less.  However, in the first quarter of this year, he already had to  spend DM48,000, which includes bills from December of last year.  Other units have mentioned similar figures. One can predict,  without taking any risks, that in the second quarter, or in the  third quarter at the latest, the civilian maintenance of  military vehicles will collapse. At the Technical Supervisory  Association, certificates have been denied and permits  withdrawn. The demand for repair work will not disappear, but  increase with each quarter. In addition, there will also be  damage resulting from the fact that equipment is not used.    Personnel is the most important thing, however. The  Bundeswehr finally has a corps of noncommissioned officers that  one can only wish for. Almost every company now has a second  lieutenant as was envisaged. The first sergeants, who command  third and fourth platoons are masters of their job after years  of advancement and experience. One sees that in the respect  with which they are treated by officers and in the manner in  which sergeants speak to officers. The conduct is strikingly  open and friendly, although one does not get the impression that  this is so at the expense of discipline. On the contrary, in  relation to "internal leadership," it has probably never been so  good before. Commanders talk about "high motivation."    Now in particular, however, they are being denied the  possibility of taking on men performing national service who  have discovered the Bundeswehr as a profession as longer-serving  soldiers, either because vacancies to be filled by promotion or  funds for future noncommissioned officers have been frozen, or  because currently, every battalion has a three-month period  during which men liable for military service cannot be taken on  as a result of insufficient funds and thus companies remain  "empty" for a three-month period. At the end of the year then,  there is a shortage of noncommissioned officers or specialists,  for example, drivers for vehicles transporting fuel and  ammunition and mine-clearing vehicles. The training lasts about  10 months. If men cannot then serve longer and achieve  appropriate promotion, they are only available for the remaining  two months of the basic military service period, and that is a  poor investment. If that remains the case for several quarters,  then units will experience substantial deficiencies.  <H5>  Basic Facilities Are Being Affected </H5>   In the meantime, the economy measures have greatly exceeded  a  healthy level of reducing resources. Basic facilities are being  affected. The infrastructure at bases is not being renewed  (kitchens, laundries). Demand will not disappear, but will pile  up. The Bundeswehr can live with temporary difficulties for a  time, assuming that the gaps that emerge now will be filled  later. "We will survive. We will still achieve training  objectives. The Bundeswehr can survive a lot. We will try to  see this winter through." That is how the Lieutenant Colonel  Bentler, the commander of the 12th battalion describes the  situation in his unit. "We will try to see this winter  through." But it will only be possible to see this winter  through if it will be spring in a few months time. That is the  tacit condition for the Bundeswehr to retain the will to tackle  these difficulties. The new army inspector, Lieutenant General  Bagger, has also said that the Bundeswehr can put up with much.    If the Bundestag and the government treat things as lightly  as they have so far and will increasingly "test" how much  soldiers put up with, as well the responsibility borne by their  commanders, this patience will not disappear gradually, but will  do so relatively suddenly, without warning. The military's  inculcated obedience vis-a-vis the political leadership and  public opinion makes it difficult for the military to convey the  gravity of the situation with the domestic political noise that  is customary in a democracy.</p>

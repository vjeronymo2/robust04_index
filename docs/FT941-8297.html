			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / SIB wants pensions change: 'Cooling-off' period of 14 days proposed for transfer schemes A 'cooling-off' period is likely to be introduced in sales of personal pensions to people transferring out of employers' schemes. The proposal follows recommendations being drawn up by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog. The 'period of reflection' would mean that there would be a delay of at least 14 days between a customer taking the decision to transfer a lump sum, and the sum itself being transferred. The recommendations draw on the consultation paper published by SIB last year about cancellation rights. They also build on the standards set out in the enforcement guidance issued in 1992 by Lautro, the self-regulating organisation for the life assurance industry, and Fimbra, the self-regulating organisation for independent financial advisers. An interim statement from the network of committees advising SIB on measures to encourage better standards of selling in pension transfer cases is expected in a week's time. But a full statement will not come until the proposals have been approved by SIB's board at its meeting in March. The work was started because of concern about the mis-selling of pension transfers. A pilot study last year found evidence of widespread non-compliance with regulators' standards. SIB's steering group, which is made up of regulators, meets today to discuss recommendations from a working party. These will then go later in the week to the advisory committee chaired by Sir Douglas Wass, a former permanent secretary at the Treasury. They include plans for the regulators to authorise methods of analysing transfer details in order to ensure greater standardisation of the systems used in these complex calculations. There are also likely to be measures to ensure that regulators are in a better position to know which of the organisations they regulate are carrying out pension transfers. This could mean that special permission from the regulator would be required to carry out pension transfer business. Some of those involved in the work believe that the special permission requirement should apply to any business dealing with occupational schemes. SIB chief's horsewhip, Page 19</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Battersea power station threat CONTRACTORS at Battersea power station in London are threatening to remove steel supports holding up part of the structure because of a dispute with its owners. Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons, which is owed about Pounds 20m for civil engineering work undertaken on the site, is in dispute with the Hwang family of Hong Kong which in effect now owns the site as mortgagee. The family, represented in Britain by Mr Victor Hwang, took possession of the building at the weekend and locked the gates on McAlpine workers who had been looking after site offices and machinery. McAlpine has rejected a Hwang offer of 1p in the pound for its debt. It is demanding its machinery back and says it wants to remove structural supports installed under its contract with Mr John Broome's Battersea Leisure, the former owner of the site. Mr Simon Broakes, McAlpine's group property and special projects manager, said: 'We have literally been supporting that building for many years. We would not do anything to compromise the structural integrity of the building. But Victor Hwang has to decide whether he wants to buy the steelwork or replace it with his own.' McAlpine has agreed that it will only remove the steelwork under the supervision of English Heritage which has responsibility for listing historical monuments. English Heritage said yesterday that any structural alteration to the building would require listed building consent.</p>

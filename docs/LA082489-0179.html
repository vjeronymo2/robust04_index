			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> PROSECUTION RESTS CASE IN TRIAL OF ACCUSED VAN NUYS DRUG DEALER  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors rested their case this morning in the drug-trafficking  trial of a Honduran charged with operating a massive cocaine distribution  network out of Van Nuys.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Pamela Rymer denied a defense motion to dismiss the case  against Juan Ramon Matta, 44, after the prosecution completed its case in the  trial that has lasted 15 days in the U.S. Courthouse downtown.  </P> <P> Matta is accused of running a network that in a seven-month period moved more  than a ton of cocaine into the United States. According to Matta's indictment,  officials confiscated 114 pounds of the drug and $1.9 million in cash at a Van  Nuys apartment on Sept. 21, 1981. At the time, it was the largest combined  seizure of cocaine and cash in California history.  </P> <P> Federal investigators used documents seized during the raid to lead them to  Matta, who was known in the network as "El Negro," prosecutors said. The  government's case also has relied on convicted drug dealer Hector Barona, who  testified that he arranged the shipment of cocaine for Matta from Colombia to  Florida and then to Van Nuys.  </P> <P> Matta was arrested while aboard a U.S.-bound plane in April, 1988, after he was  whisked out of Honduras and taken to the Dominican Republic by Honduran  officials.  </P></p>

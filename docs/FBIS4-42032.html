			<p>BFN     [Text] Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian  Qichen began a visit to Belarus on 29 June. Belarusian Foreign  Minister Pyotr Krawchanka said at a news conference that during  talks with his Chinese counterpart -- held on the first day of  the visit -- bilateral cooperation and cooperation within the  framework of international organizations were discussed.    The Chinese side expressed great interest in the extension  of  economic relations between the two states. As of today, Belarus  and China have signed 11 bilateral agreements concerning all  spheres of cooperation. An agreement to sign new pacts in the  immediate future on bilateral cooperation in such areas as  communication and information systems, air traffic, and criminal  extraditions was reached. A principal decision to draft a  political agreement between the two states was also adopted.  All these documents could be signed in late 1994 during a  planned visit by top Chinese officials to Minsk. Practical  issues connected with the establishment of joint  Belarusian-Chinese ventures -- primarily the setting up of a  joint venture dealing with the assembling and servicing of BELAZ  trucks on Chinese territory -- were also discussed. Mr. Qian  Qichen pointed out in his speech that China favors the  strengthening of Belarusian-Chinese cooperation in all fields.  The Chinese foreign minister sees the key goal of bilateral  relations in the implementation of the existing 11 agreements.</p>

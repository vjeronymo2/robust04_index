			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Pre-paid card ousts New York's subway token It is the beginning of the end of an era for the 3.3m passengers who use New York's subway system each day. For 40 years, one of the quirks of life in New York City has been the custom of carrying around a bulging pocket or purse full of the coin-size metal tokens that people need to buy before they can ride the subway. The tokens, costing Dollars 1.25 (83p) each and valid for any length of journey, operate the turnstiles that let passengers through to the trains. Time-obsessed New Yorkers buy them in bulk to avoid having to queue at the token booths in the stations each time they want to ride. Not, however, for much longer. Between now and 1997, the New York Transit Authority plans to steal a march on the world's other big subway systems by phasing out the tokens and phasing in the MetroCard, a thin plastic card which stores the value of pre-paid trips on a magnetic strip. Passengers will be able to buy the pre-paid cards from token booths in any denomination up to Dollars 80. Each time they swipe them through a card reader at the turnstile, the turnstile will open, Dollars 1.25 will be deducted from the card, and the value remaining will be displayed. When the card is empty, it can be thrown away or recharged at a booth. Although similar to systems in other big cities, the MetroCard is technologically more sophisticated because it allows payments to be deducted each time a transaction is made instead of allowing unlimited journeys over a period of time for a fixed cost. This means it can be extended to a much wider range of uses than other types of card. In the short term, the New York Transit Authority plans to extend it to the buses and commuter railways it operates, but it also hopes it will eventually be used to pay ferry and taxi fares in New York, and tolls on roads and bridges. Ultimately, Mr Peter Stangle, the transit authority chairman, wants to bring in a private sector business partner to develop the MetroCard into an all-purpose payment card for the region. One day, he believes, people will use it 'to make phone calls, buy the paper, grab a coffee and a bagel, and even go get a bite at McDonald's'. Surprisingly, perhaps, normally sceptical New Yorkers seem ready to welcome the MetroCard. At Wall Street station in downtown Manhattan, where it came into operation experimentally last month, an FT straw poll of 12 subway travellers found none who regretted the passing of the tokens. Most believed the best argument for the card was that it saved time, apparently calculating that the swiping movement at the turnstiles took a fraction of a second less than depositing a token and waiting for it to tumble through the mechanism. 'I think it's an excellent idea,' said Mr Ross Rosado, a florist's assistant. 'Quicker is better. This is New York.'</p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USAIR BRINGS PSA'S SMILE PARTIALLY OUT OF RETIREMENT  </P> <P> USAir, which wiped the smiles off Pacific Southwest Airlines' jetliners after  acquiring San Diego-based PSA in early 1988, has reestablished at least a small  grin.  </P> <P> USAir won't be painting smiles on its own jet fleet, but the airline is adding  smiles to the noses of nine USAir Express propjets that provide commuter  service in California, Arizona and Nevada, USAir spokesman Larry Pickett said  Thursday.  </P> <P> PSA folklore credits the first smile -- an uptilted curve painted just under a  plane's nose -- to a mischievous maintenance man. But former PSA executives say  it evolved from a 1969 advertising campaign that eventually included the  airline's "Catch Our Smile" slogan.  </P> <P> USAir, based in Arlington, Va., retired the smile after "extensive marketing  studies." But now, the airline, encountering tough competition in California,  apparently believes that the smile might help boost market share for the USAir  Express operation that Phoenix-based StatesWest Airlines has operated for USAir  since July.  </P> <P> StatesWest, which has painted its aircraft to match USAir's red, white and blue  livery, is "very excited about having the smile," StatesWest Chairman Rudy R.  Miller said. He said he wanted to use the smile because, like the old PSA,  USAir Express has a "fun-oriented West Coast customer-service attitude."  StatesWest actively sought USAir's approval to use the PSA smile, a registered  trademark now owned by USAir, he added.  </P> <P> The advertising world recalls the PSA smile "as an outstanding and fun" tool,  according to Bob Kwait, an executive with Phillips Ramsey, a San Diego  advertising agency. But he said he's not sure the smile can help an airline  other than PSA.  </P></p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Quotas raise questions about DTI's competence Sir, Philosophical discussions over subsidiarity in relation to the Cardiff Bay barrage and the sudden introduction of EU import quotas on Chinese silk shirts miss the point (Letters, April 25 and 28, and report, 'Clothes retailers hit as Brussels imposes limits on silk imports', April 22). The silk shirts affair throws up far more disturbing questions about the competence of the Department of Trade and Industry and the Foreign Office. Didn't the DTI and the FO have any idea in advance that the EU wanted to impose quotas? If they did, why was there no warning to British importers, which are left with overseas stock they have paid for but cannot bring in? If they did not, why on earth not? The important issue here is whether British industry is suffering yet again from the failure of our politicians and civil servants to understand how to monitor and influence developments in Brussels.

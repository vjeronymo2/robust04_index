			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CONNER TO RACE FOR NEW SYNDICATE IN 1992  </P> <P> Whether the America's Cup is in San Diego or Auckland, New Zealand, skipper  Dennis Conner will be racing for it in 1992.  </P> <P> Conner announced Sunday the formation of "Team Dennis Conner," the syndicate  under which he will race for the next challenge, either in Auckland or San  Diego -- pending an appeal by the America's Cup Organizing Committee to  overturn a court decision that awarded New Zealand the cup.  </P> <P> John Marshall, Conner's boat designer in 1987 and 1988, will head the  syndicate, which Conner hopes will raise up to $35 million through private  donations and corporate sponsorships.  </P> <P> Conner said the funds are needed to build two boats, campaign worldwide and to  run the crews, which will grow from 28 people to 60.  </P> <P> He is confident that the syndicate can help the United States' chances of  winning the America's Cup in 1992.  </P> <P> "We feel this syndicate has hit the ground running with experienced, qualified  winners that are capable of doing the job one more time," Conner said during a  press conference at his home in Point Loma. "We can step up to bat and do an  excellent job of representing America, whether it's in San Diego or New  Zealand."  </P> <P> The syndicate will be one of 26 challengers from 11 countries. Additional yacht  clubs could join the race up until 30 days after the court decision has been  rendered, the same time period that Conner must decide what club he will  represent.  </P> <P> "I'm hoping to be sailing for the San Diego Yacht Club," he said. "I'm not  deciding until the decision comes down."  </P> <P> Conner put to rest any speculation that he would retire from America's Cup  racing. After five appearances and with the current controversy, he said it  wasn't the time to quit.  </P> <P> "I think I may have retired," Conner said, "but it just doesn't seem right to  me to have some judge in New York take the America's Cup, put a postage stamp  on it and send it to New Zealand. They never beat us on the water . . . and  it's not my way to stand by and not do what I can to bring the cup back."  </P></p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of New Zealand (3): A third force enters the political equation - The election later this year threatens to prove embarrassing for the ruling National party TWO and a half years after coming to power in a landslide election victory, Mr Jim Bolger is New Zealand's most unpopular prime minister since opinion polling began. Mr Bolger's National party government has trailed the opposition Labour party since shortly after the election, and has at times even fallen behind the Alliance coalition, a populist third party grouping. A month ago, the government was 16 points behind the Opposition in the most widely watched opinion poll, and even loyalists were forecasting that Mr Bolger's leadership could come under pressure unless things improved quickly. Yet, the economy grew by 3 per cent in calendar 1993 - double the average rate in the previous 20 years, inflation is steady at about one per cent, and unemployment has fallen to 9.8 per cent from a peak of 11.1 per cent. Recent polls have suggested that the government is finally beginning to make up ground on Labour, helped by a successful overseas trip by Mr Bolger and hints of a give-away Budget next month. But political analysts say there are four main reasons why National faces the possibility of a humiliating defeat in the next election, which must be held by November: National won in 1990 because it gave the impression that the free-market reforms of the 1984-90 Labour government would be reversed. Its extension of the reforms to the labour market and social security left the government open to charges that it had misled the electorate. Few of the benefits of economic recovery have yet flowed through to ordinary people. The result has been growing income inequality in what was once one of the world's most egalitarian countries. Ten years of dramatic economic change has involved much of the population in painful restructuring. The governing party is the easiest target for angry voters, as Labour discovered three years ago. New Zealand's political landscape has been fragmented by the strains which have accompanied economic restructuring, raising the possibility of volatile shifts in political support away from both main parties. The initial split took place during the last Labour government, when Mr Jim Anderton, an amiable old-fashioned socialist with a colourful turn of phrase, took much of the party's far left into his New Labour Party. Against all predictions, Mr Anderton held his Christchurch seat at the election, and subsequently displayed considerable political skills in welding together a coalition of five minor parties, called the Alliance. Support for the Alliance has fallen to about 22 per cent in recent polls from a peak of nearly 40 per cent in late 1991, but its prospects could be transformed by a further split between National and Mr Winston Peters, the highly popular Maori MP for Tauranga. A Heylen opinion poll suggested last month that a party led by Mr Peters, now sitting as an independent MP, would win 26 per cent of the popular vote. Together, the Alliance and Mr Peters won 35 per cent support, which could be enough to win a three-party election under New Zealand's first past the post electoral system. The poll prompted rapid contacts between Mr Anderton and Mr Peters but so far the two men have held only 'talks about talks.' And there are a number of hurdles in the way of a successful electoral arrangement. Much of the support for Mr Peters overlaps with support for the Alliance, especially in Auckland, the country's biggest city. Alliance candidates in many constituencies might be unwilling to step aside to give candidates supporting Mr Peters a clear run. The alternative would be for Mr Peters, 43, to join the Alliance. But he would probably want to assume the leadership. Mr Anderton says he is willing to step aside, but only after a party conference, which would be hard to arrange before the election. The Alliance is already strained by differences between New Labour and its partners: the anti-development Greens, the Maori rights Mana Motuhake party, and two renegade conservative parties, the Liberals and Democrats. Mr Peters shares with all the parties an abhorrence for the deregulatory free market government policies of the last decade. But he is still a conservative - he voted, for example, for labour market deregulation, which is anathema to New Labour. Mr Peters has maintained his popularity largely by avoiding setting out his own policies, leaving considerable doubt about where he stands. Much of his popularity might disappear if he was forced to make hard choices. So far, Mr Peters is keeping his options open - 'the ball is in Winston's court. He has indicated that he will take part in talks, but we are waiting for him to respond,' says Mr Anderton. Predictably, both the main parties cling to the hope that an agreement between the Alliance and Mr Peters will prove impossible to arrange, or that it will fall apart under the strain of an election campaign. Mr Don McKinnon, Deputy Prime Minister, says National is confident that it can recover sufficient support to win the election 'if we can demonstrate our strengths as managers of the economy.' National is also counting on the historical tendency for government support to improve in the run-up to an election. But Mr McKinnon admits that the government has been distracted by the internal battle with Mr Peters, who was given 'an inordinate amount of time' to come into line before he was ejected from the party early this year. The infighting has also hampered the government's attempts to highlight divisions between Labour's free market and socialist wings, which have been successfully papered over by Mr Mike Moore, the Labour leader - 'probably we have not done a good job in exposing the Labour Party in its true colours,' he says. Mr Moore has spent the last 32 months distancing Labour from the record of the 1984-90 government, mainly by concentrating on the government's social security, health and labour market reforms. He has successfully resisted pressure to commit the party to reverse the free market thrust of the last decade, although it would re-introduce a measure of labour market deregulation. Nevertheless, the election result remains unpredictable, at least until the shape of any agreement between Mr Peters and the Alliance becomes clear.</p>

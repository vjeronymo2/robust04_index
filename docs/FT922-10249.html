			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Scottish Cities hit by takeover costs Net asset value per share at Scottish Cities Investment Trust declined from 90.7p to 86.4p in a first half dominated by the takeover in November of Anglo Scandinavian. This was reflected by increased administration expenses and provision for the interest on its zero coupon debenture, met by transfer from capital reserves. Interest payable jumped from Pounds 131,000 to Pounds 536,000. Net revenue fell to Pounds 42,000 (Pounds 365,000). The interim dividend is unchanged at 0.9p on earnings of 0.1p (1.1p restated).</p>

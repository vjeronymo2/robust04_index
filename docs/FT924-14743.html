			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Ciments Francais The size of the black hole uncovered by investigating accountants at Ciments Francais can hardly be gauged from last night's brief statement. But the resignation of the chairman - and the suspension of share quotes in Paris and Milan - suggest that Italcementi may well seek to renegotiate the FFr6bn it paid for a controlling stake in its French rival. Paribas, though, may yet be the main victim. The French financial group, whose share price yesterday slumped 4.4 per cent to FFr278, was not only the vendor in this year's transaction; it retains a 34 per cent stake in Ciments Francais after underwriting an unsuccessful share placing. If there are financial horrors in this case, the episode will serve as a warning to those now embarking on a fresh round of cross-border deals. The pace of M &amp; A activity in Europe has markedly slowed in the third quarter, but it would be wrong to think that the process of industrial restructuring will be seriously derailed by doubts over Maastricht, or even currency turbulence. The message is that even well-regarded groups - and Ciments Francais, if highly geared and aggressive, was certainly that - may not be everything they are cracked up to be. The building materials and contracting sectors, of course, have been particularly accident prone. Steetley's French aggregates business, for instance, may have cost the UK company its independence, while Hochtief (Rush &amp; Tomkins), Bilfinger &amp; Berger (Birse), and Dumez (McAlpine) can hardly be thrilled with their UK investments. RMC and Redland, though, have demonstrated the rewards for getting it right.</p>

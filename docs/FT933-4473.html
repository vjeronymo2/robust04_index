			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (13): Council drives a hard bargain - Site visit / IT strategy and attention to detail pay dividends WESTMINSTER City Council's first step towards contracting out its computing was to draw up an internal computing strategy. As a result, it has the future mapped out well beyond the end of its seven-year facilities management (FM) contract and was able to negotiate more flexible arrangements. 'Without a proper information technology (IT) strategy we would simply have contracted out what we were already doing and carried on with the same systems,' says financial director Bill Roots. Those systems run on a large, central, IBM mainframe computer and on a variety of smaller departmental machines. There were about 110 staff in the central unit and about 30 others attached to individual departments. Westminster City Council, covering central London, is no stranger to contracting out services of all kinds and was doing so long before the government introduced compulsory competitive tendering. The council now has almost 40 contracts worth a total of more than Pounds 60m a year and bringing savings of Pounds 10m a year. IT's turn came up early last year but there was concern about the large variety of systems and computers. 'Since the mid-1980s a lot of different kit had been installed in different departments and we hadn't really worked out where we were going overall,' says Roots. 'We felt we needed a clear long-term strategy. In particular, we wanted to avoid more in-house development and go for program packages and also move to open systems.' Every department in the council looked at how computing supported its activities and how IT might be developed. 'We decided to contract out the computing centre first: that was the biggest unit and success here would prove the merits of facilities management to the departments. In addition, the strategy involved running down the mainframe eventually.' Despite Westminster's experience of contracting out services, Roots says that the FM negotiations were the most complex and difficult he had done. 'Usually you're given a price and that's it,' he says. 'With facilities management you get a price and then you start to negotiate. For example the supplier wants to examine and systems and vet the staff's skills. Our eventual supplier started Pounds 3m more expensive than the cheapest offer. 'We were only considering the mainframe operations side at that time. We were impressed by what the various suppliers could offer and we added system development, the help desk and the telecommunications network; the prices gradually came closer together.' Westminster chose ITnet as its supplier. The contract is worth Pounds 38m over seven years and the council expects to save Pounds 11m. ITnet has taken over the mainframe and most of the 110 central computing staff. 'ITnet wasn't the cheapest,' says Roots. 'In fact, we rejected the cheapest, because I wasn't happy about their balance sheet. ITnet showed in their presentations and written submissions that they understood our needs.' Westminster was especially attractive to ITnet, according to managing director Simon Ricketts, because the company was looking for a base in central London. 'Opportunities are arising here, especially in the insurance business, with the end of the recession.' Two details illustrate the complexities of the negotiations. ITnet wanted a central London base but also the option to move out of such expensive offices when the time was right. 'Taking on the mainframe wasn't a consideration for us but the accommodation was an issue,' says Ricketts. 'We've taken a lease with Westminster which is flexible but enables us to get out after 12 months. If we then move to cheaper premises, we pay Westminster 20 per cent of the saving. So it's a good deal for both sides.' Another contract issue almost put the whole deal at risk. Westminster had 14 leases on various items of computer equipment. But the terms no longer reflected the equipment value. 'We got into very heavy negotiations with the leasing companies, who were not the easiest people to deal with,' says Roots. 'At one stage the FM deal was off. I wasn't prepared to pay what they wanted and I was ready to make their name mud in the market. In the end they came round.' Meanwhile Westminster was also negotiating over the staff. This was 'a big issue and a difficult one', Roots says. The council wanted to find a way to avoid redundancy costs, give the staff continuity of employment, yet not require ITnet to offer exactly the same terms and conditions. Things went wrong when the council was given conflicting legal advice. The uncertainty made the staff 'suspicious and nervous' about what was happening. The computer operations manager, Colin Kettley, now employed by ITnet as site manager, confirms this feeling among the staff. 'The legal negotiations certainly affected morale,' he recalls. The situation was becoming fraught and it got to the stage where people were looking forward to the move, just to end the uncertainty.' Roots says ITnet 'did a good job', talking to staff and making job offers very soon afterwards, some time before the contract was even finalised. Kettley agrees. Roots adds: 'We learned a lesson here. If I did it again I'd tackle this area much sooner. You can't have such indecision: it's not fair on people.' Even so, only six people were made redundant compulsorily; another 15 'took friendly redundancy,' as Roots puts it. Kettley, one of the 90 who did get transferred, appreciates the new regime. 'There's a much more open style of management, which benefits staff by involving them more,' he says. The installation is manned almost entirely by former Westminster staff. Westminster expects to save Pounds 11m over the life of the contract. But Bill Roots sees equal benefits elsewhere: 'We've gained flexibility by getting rid of the big central machine, the staff and the systems migration problems. Since moving to FM, Westminster has contracted out its payroll administration - again to ITnet. The contract runs for three years at a total cost of Pounds 1.5m; Westminster expects to save Pounds 500,000. Westminster is now turning to the departmental systems. ITnet has already won a contract from the social services department but it is far from assured a clean sweep: most contracts will go out to full tender. After all, this is Westminster.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Fighting between Burmese Government soldiers and  soldiers of the ethnic minority groups headed by Khun Sa has  continued unabated for seven weeks. On 23 June ethnic minority  soldiers used a SAM-7 rocket to shoot down a Chinese-made  government F-7 attack bomber near Mongton. The two pilots were  killed.    According to a report, Burmese Government soldiers were sent  to search for the bodies of the pilots. They engaged in an  intense clash with ethnic minority soldiers who also tried to  reach the downed aircraft. Regarding the fighting in Monghtaw,  government troops lost several camps and ethnic minority  soldiers were able to control most of the town.    At 1500 on 25 June, ethnic minority soldiers ambushed  government troops who were patrolling the east bank of the  Salween River north of Mongchut, killing seven.    Fighting reportedly subsided in many areas, particularly  from  the area opposite Muang District, Thailand's Mae Hong Son  Province, to opposite Thailand's Chiang Dao District, and in the  area opposite Mae Sai District and Mae Fa Luang Subdistrict.  However, fighting around Mongchut and Monghtaw continues  sporadically.    Recent heavy rains have caused many soldiers from both sides  to contract Malaria which resulted in a lull in the fighting.</p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIFE IS A BED OF ROSES -- HIS CREATIONS BLOOM WORLDWIDE  </P> <P> When Ralph Moore went to the bank a few weeks ago he took along a pink and  yellow miniature rose plant.  </P> <P> He stopped by the desk of Mary Hill, the assistant vice president. "What a  gorgeous rose," Hill said. "It's my favorite color, pink."  </P> <P> "It's my newest flower," Moore explained. "I want to name it after a friend,  but I need her permission first."  </P> <P> "What a lucky person. She will just love it," the banker said.  </P> <P> "Will you give me your permission?" Moore asked.  </P> <P> Recalling that moment, Hill, longtime banker for Moore, told how she was  "flabbergasted. Imagine having a rose named after you. It immortalizes you."  </P> <P> "Especially miniature roses created by Ralph Moore. They go all over the  world."  </P> <P> Moore, 82, is one of the world's best-known rose breeders. He has developed and  named more than 300 varieties of flowers and plants over the last 68 years, 90%  of them miniature roses.  </P> <P> A plant breeder since 1921, he has been naming flowers he creates after people,  places, events and many other things since he was a 14-year-old sophomore at  Visalia High School.  </P> <P> Miniature roses he created are growing in every state, in Canada, and all over  Europe, the Mideast, Africa, the Far East, Mexico, South America, Australia and  New Zealand. Many are named for people who live in this San Joaquin Valley  town.  </P> <P> "The first rose I originated I named after Shelby Wallace, one of my best  friends in high school. He died when we were both sophomores," Moore recalled.  </P> <P> Anita Charles, a coral-red-on-yellow miniature rose, is named after a good  friend who sings in his church's choir. Rose Gilardi, a slender  mossy-red-and-pink-striped rose, is named after a woman he knows who raises  roses in San Francisco and runs a beauty shop there.  </P> <P> Little Mike is a rose he named after a grandson who was a baby at the time and  is now teaching sixth grade in Exeter. The popular Ann Moore, a bright orange  rose, is named after his wife.  </P> <P> Bit O' Sunshine was named years ago by a little girl in a Sunday school class  that Moore taught. "I brought in this new flower and she piped up: 'Mr. Moore,  that looks just like a bit of sunshine.' "  </P> <P> Walking through one of the many greenhouses at his six-acre Sequoia Nursery,  Moore observed that some plants name themselves. He pointed out a bed of roses  called Ring of Fire, glowing yellow blooms etched with red that look like a  ring of fire, and another variety called Magic Carousel, white roses with red  edges that resemble a merry-go-round.  </P> <P> He named a miniature rose Over the Rainbow because the colors made him think of  the song from "The Wizard of Oz." He came up with a striped, red and yellow  miniature rose at the time of the Coalinga earthquake. The rose is called  Earthquake.  </P> <P> When the Armenian community in Yettem, a small town near Visalia, celebrated  its 75th anniversary, Moore named a miniature purple rose St. Mary in honor of  its church.  </P> <P> "Yettem means Garden of Eden in Armenian. The community put on a big banquet  for their 75th anniversary, and my wife and I were special guests," Moore said.  </P> <P> "I was enjoying Dorothy Hamill skating on television one night and decided I  would name a rose after her. I wrote her agent for permission to do so and he  wrote back saying he wasn't interested," Moore said.  </P> <P> "Dorothy Hamill probably never saw the letter. It's too bad. That rose, now  called Rise 'n Shine, is considered the best yellow miniature in the world  today."  </P> <P> Nearly 200 of Moore's flowers are patented. Moore, who receives 8% of the  retail price for 17 years, derives a large part of his income from these  royalties. He has 10 employees at his nursery.  </P> <P> Years ago when his daughter, Eleanore Bergthold, now a teacher in Roseville,  attended Westmont College in Santa Barbara, Moore named a shrub that he  developed the Westmont Arborvite. He has donated all royalties from the plant  -- $35,000 to date -- to the school's student loan fund.  </P> <P> Moore lives next to his nursery and can be found seven days a week breeding and  developing new miniature roses in his greenhouse when he is not on the road.  </P> <P> He attends rose shows and conventions and delivers papers and programs about  miniature roses throughout this country and overseas. He has won numerous  awards and is one of three Americans presented the prestigious Dean Hole Medal  by the Royal National Rose Society of England. He has authored three books  about miniature roses.  </P> <P> Moore has never named a miniature rose after himself, but another breeder did  name a test variety that Moore's nursery had developed. He called it Ralph's  Creeper and the name stuck. Its blooms are bright red with large yellow eyes.  </P> <P> Whenever Moore travels he sees his creations. While attending a World Rose  meeting in Israel in 1981, for example, he visited the nation's biggest  kibbutz.  </P> <P> "My wife and I had a thrill. At the entrance to the kibbutz there was a large  bed full of miniature roses. They were Mona Ruths, a rose I developed and named  after our daughter, Mona Ruth Sorenson."  </P></p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: Pilots offer USAir Dollars 750m deal Pilots at USAir,the sixth-largest carrier in the US, have offered to make Dollars 750m in payroll concessions over five years in exchange for an equity position in the airline. The proposal, submitted by the Air Lines Pilots Association, was a response to USAir's call for Dollars 1bn in overall cost reductions by 1997. The initial reaction by USAir, in which British Airways has a 22 per cent stake, was positive. The airline said it was 'pleased' the pilots 'recognised the need to move forward and was looking forward to discussions' over the union's ideas. Further talks between the two sides had not been scheduled, however. The development comes just two weeks after shareholders of UAL, parent of United Airlines, approved a plan giving its employees a 55 per cent stake in the carrier in exchange for pay cuts and changes in work rules. The offer by USAir's pilots envisages a 'restructuring' of the carrier's financial obligations, and a 'substantial' influx of fresh capital. In return for average annual pay reductions of Dollars 150m, the pilots are seeking 'substantial investment returns through equity, preferred stock and profit sharing'. The union said it would complete the details of its proposal this week, and present them 'shortly'. The wage cuts represented 'the same share of the (company's) goal as our share of the total payrolls', the union said. USAir surprised Wall Street last week by posting improved net income of Dollars 13.8m in the second quarter, against Dollars 5.8m a year earlier.</p>

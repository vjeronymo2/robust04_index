			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: M&amp;G gives details of Recovery Trust issue M&amp;G, the fund management group, has issued preliminary details of its Recovery Investment Trust, which it plans to launch later this month. The trust will have a split capital structure, like the Income Investment Trust which M&amp;G launched last year. There will be three classes of shares: income, capital and zero dividend preference. The issue will have two parts: an offer for subscription, in which investors will only be able to apply for a package of all three shares, and a tender offer by SG Warburg in which investors will be able to buy the individual components and a geared unit, comprising the income and capital shares together. Listing particulars will be published on February 14 and the offer will close on March 27. The launch of the trust is timed so that investors will be able to place a full Pounds 6,000 into a personal equity plan for each of the tax years 1991-92 and 1992-93. As with the Income Trust, M&amp;G has put an intensive marketing effort into the launch and this has resulted in higher expenses - at a maximum of 4.76 per cent - than are normal for an investment trust launch. The annual management fee will be 0.75 per cent. The yield on the trust is expected to be about that payable on M&amp;G's Recovery unit trust, which currently pays 5.1 per cent.</p>

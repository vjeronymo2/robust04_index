			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Traders await FOMC meeting US Treasury prices were mostly flat in quiet trading yesterday ahead of today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/32 at 96 1/32 yielding 7.839 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/32 at 99 3/8 , yielding 7.580 per cent. There was some short-covering as traders prepared for the Fed's open market committee meeting. For weeks the market has been up and down on speculation about whether the Fed would raise rates. In November the Fed finally convinced investors that it would hold the line against inflation, which caused the yield spread between the two-year and the 30-year bond to fall sharply as traders bet that the Fed might raise rates in December. A flattening yield curve is interpreted as a signal that the market expects economic slowing. Over the past two weeks, many have reversed their bets about a December rate increase  - and the yield spread widened modestly  - as mild inflation numbers convinced many that the central bank might wait for the new year to put rates up again. Politics has also become a concern for the market recently, as Democrats and Republicans try win the hearts of voters with tax-cutting plans. UK government bonds rose slightly, and the December long gilt future moved up  7/32 to around 102 3/8 in late trading. The yield spread over German government bonds was around 115 in late trading. Mr Andrew Roberts at UBS said trade was very thin, with investors unlikely to place large orders before the new year. He said flows were likely to remain very thin ahead of Christmas; however, support from domestic investors was underpinning gilt prices. German government bonds slipped, and the March bund futures contract on Liffe fell by around 0.21 on the day to 89.70 in late trading. An analyst at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt said trading was likely to remain very slow in the run-up to Christmas, but there was substantial support for bunds at the 89.70 level. Italian government bonds fell, and the March bond futures contract on Liffe moved to around 98.14 in late trading, a fall of 0.47. Mr Pio de Gregorio at NatWest Markets said investors were worried about political events, but these worries were obscuring the positive fundamentals. He said: 'Inflation is trending down, but the worries of the political developments and the public finances are very much the focus of investors' attention. The lira looks extremely undervalued. It has an enormous risk premium because of the political uncertainty.'</p>

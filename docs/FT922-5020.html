			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Serbs defy UN to hit Sarajevo: Energy supplies may be rationed as international sanctions begin to bite THE Bosnian capital of Sarajevo last night came under heavy bombardment from Serb irregular forces in defiance of United Nations sanctions and an agreement to implement a ceasefire. The bombardment, which started less than two hours after the ceasefire was due to come into effect, appeared to indicate that power is passing to local Serbian warlords in Sarajevo and opposing Bosnian militia groups. The renewed fighting raises the question of whether authorities in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, can control their irregular forces. In response to the sanctions, Serbia yesterday sent General Zivota Panic, commander of the Yugoslav federal army, to Sarajevo where he was due to hold talks with Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic. The two were to discuss implementing the ceasefire, which was to start at 1600 GMT yesterday. The fighting took place as Serbia prepared for energy rationing to offset the impact of the sanctions, designed to put pressure on the republic to stop the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina. President Slobodan Milosevic vowed that Serbs would never bow to international pressure. 'The people have said that they want to be masters of their own destiny,' he said. The sanctions, as tough as those imposed on Iraq in 1990, are already beginning to bite. Mr Nikola Sainovic, Serbia's minister of energy, said oil derivatives would soon be 'conserved', a signal that rationing was planned. In the run-up to the deadline set for the ceasefire yesterday, Sarajevo Radio reported that Serb militia had bombarded the city hall. One person was killed and three were injured. According to the radio, at least 30 people have been killed and 115 wounded in the past 24 hours in Bosnia and on the borders with Croatia. In Belgrade, President Milosevic said 'the great results' of Sunday's parliamentary and local elections, which the main opposition parties boycotted, supported the government's defiant stand. 'They (the results) are a reply to all those enemies outside, and internally, who have conducted a campaign against the elections. The results are of enormous significance for the democratic process,' he added. Final results have not been announced. The UN said it would begin talks today with the warring parties to try to open Sarajevo airport for humanitarian supplies. In Belgrade, people were buying up household goods while the long petrol queues grew even longer. The black market currency rate in Belgrade rose sharply from 1,300 dinars to the dollar to more than 1,700. The official rate is 323 dinars to the dollar.

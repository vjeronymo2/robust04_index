			<p>BFN     [Text] Simferopol, 14 Apr -- Crimean President Yuriy  Meshkov has issued a number of decrees appointing Anatoliy  Franchuk, former first deputy chairman of the Crimean Cabinet of  Ministers, as acting minister for the management of state  enterprises in Crimea, and Lyudmila Zaytseva, as acting minister  of finance. Andriy Chernyavskiy is appointed Crimea's acting  minister of economy. Decrees have been issued on the dismissal  of Militia Major General Oleksandr Plyuta, Crimea's internal  affairs minister, and his replacement with Army Major General  Valeriy Kuznetsov known for his dismissal from the post of  Crimean Army Corps Commander in 1994 for his failure to obey a  decree by the Ukrainian defense minister. Another President  Meshkov decree dismisses General Ivan Kolomyytsev, head of  Crimea's security service, and replaces him with Retired Major  General Volodymyr Lepikhov from the Crimean presidential staff.    Personnel of Crimea's Internal Affairs Ministry and Security  Service have refused to comply with Meshkov's decrees. The  premises of these departments are surrounded by unidentified  armed individuals (according to some observers, the Crimean  president's so-called personal bodyguards). The dismissed  generals, Plyuta and Kolomyytsev, are guarded by their  supporters.    The Crimean president's decrees are subject to the Crimean  Supreme Council's approval at its next session on 10 May.  According to the law, the issued decrees contradict the  Constitutions of both Ukraine and Crimea, as well as the law of  Ukraine on the division of powers between state power bodies of  Ukraine and Crimea, said Crimea's Supreme Council Chairman  Mykola Bahrov.</p>

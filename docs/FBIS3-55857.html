More than that, in  the past days it provokes military actions on the Armenian-Azeri  border. Northern areas of Armenia were shelled in the most  barbarous way, the presidential spokesman Aram Abramyan has told  the briefing in Yerevan.    He has said Azerbaijan has again illusions to solve the  problem militarily. Armenia's position is unchanged, the  problem cannot be solved militarily, said Abramyan. That is why  the Armenian leadership will use every possibility to try to  solve the problem politically, said the spokesman.    In this connection he said that Armenia backs any  peace-keeping initiative in this direction, including the recent  initiative proposed by Iran. Out of its two key provisions --  the ceasefire and the status of Nagoro-Karabakh -- Armenia has  concentrated on the first one, since only during the ceasefire  it is possible to conduct talks on a political status.</p>

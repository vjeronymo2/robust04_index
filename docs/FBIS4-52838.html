			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Criticism Against Leadership Pours </F> Out in the Democratic Socialist Party Over `Kaishin' Issue"]    [Text] Within the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] which  was a party to the forming of "Kaishin," a new parliamentary  group of the ruling coalition parties in the House of  Representatives, stinging criticism is now being poured out  against its leadership. Considered as having blackmailed the  Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and thus as having  driven it out of the coalition, the party is now under heavy  attack from its two supporting labor unions -- the Japanese  Private Sector Trade Union Confederation [Rengo] and the Yuai  Council. Among party members there is now a growing sense of  crisis that if a next general election is held under the current  medium electoral district system, "the DSP will meet a  catastrophe." It is becoming increasingly possible that the DSP  party convention in June will become an arena where the party  members go all-out demanding that Chairman Keigo Ouchi and  Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa take responsibility.    "How many party members can be elected without support from  labor unions if the next election is held under the current  medium electoral district system?" This question was asked at  an emergency general meeting of DSP Dietmen held on 28 April  when the Hata administration was inaugurated. A majority of  party members argued, "Taking responsibility for causing the  SPDJ to withdraw from the coalition, Chairman Keigo Ouchi and  other party leaders should not take posts in the new cabinet."  Party Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa, put on the defensive,  hurriedly called Ouchi to the meeting. The meeting was  adjourned eventually after the matter was "left to the  leadership" to decide. But the prevailing air is that this time  things will not settle down easily by "letting the air out" as  in the past.    The DSP--which sent Ouchi (as the health and welfare  minister) and Atushi Kanda (as director general of the Defense  Agency) into the cabinet--initially sought to obtain three posts  by also sending party Policy Board Chairman Kansei Nakano into  the cabinet. A DSP source said that Ouchi had expected to land a  post of the foreign minister or deputy prime minister in  recognition of his "special constributions."    A goal of the new floor group is said to be "to give strong  support to the Hata administration" (according to Yonezawa).  However, a ranking DSP official says, this in fact means "to  take away the posts of the chairman of the [house] Budget  Committee and the head of ruling parties' Tax System Reform  Council from the SDPJ and to give them to people from the  largest organization of the ruling parties. There was also the  expectation that "if the new floor group is formed, the SDPJ  will lose one ministerial post and the DSP will get it." In  addition, Ouchi had a design of solidifying his base within his  own party.    Neither Ouchi nor Yonezawa had informed Rengo Chairman Akira  Yamagishi and SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo of this plan  for the new floor group in advance because they were scared lest  the plan, if exposed, should be crushed. As such, even the DSP  members, who originally supported the plan, have misgivings  about this "foul play" done on the SDPJ. A DSP Dietman of the  House of Councilors said: "Once a politician betrays people, he  is done with. The SDPJ might have agreed with Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] on policy matters, but the former was an  existence different from the latter in that sense."    At the general meeting, the leadership persuaded members by  saying: "To take responsibility, we should support the  administration from within the cabinet. It is not a time for us  to run away from problems." But many DSP members said: "The  chairman and the secretary general used to have their way in  controlling the party, but after 8 April when former Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced his resignation, discontent  erupted and the leadership no longer has power to control it."  No doubt, the party leadership will have a tough time once the  DSP Dietmen return from visits to their home towns during the  national holidays [April 29-5 May].</p>

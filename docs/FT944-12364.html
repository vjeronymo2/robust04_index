			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Markets hit as industry signal spurs inflation fears US bond and share prices - and the dollar - fell yesterday, after financial markets' fears of inflation were fuelled by evidence that US manufacturing activity accelerated again in October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 44.75 to close at 3,863.37 and the 30-year Treasury bond fell almost a full point. The dollar, after losing ground in New York, opened at a new low of Y96.51 in Tokyo early today, despite intervention by the Bank of Japan to support it. The market setbacks came after the National Association of Purchasing Managers said its monthly index rose to 59.7 per cent in October from 58.2 per cent in September. The rise signalled a pick-up in business activity after a slowdown in the third quarter. Mr Ralph Kauffman, chairman of the NAPM's survey committee, said if the index stayed at its October level it would probably indicate a growth rate for the overall economy of around 5.4 per cent, far in excess of the 3.4 per cent annual rate reported last week for the third quarter. The evidence of renewed strength in the manufacturing sector raised the prospect that the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, might raise interest rates at its November 15 meeting by more than the half percentage point already widely anticipated. Yields on the 30-year Treasury bond pushed back above 8 per cent, and interest rate analysts said the spread of more than two percentage points between the Fed's short-term federal funds rate and the two-year Treasury note suggested the markets were already banking on an increase next month of at least three quarters of a percentage point. Adding to the financial markets' concern were signs within the NAPM that manufacturers might be feeling increasing pressure to raise their prices. The NAPM index of prices paid for materials rose to 79.9 in October, its highest level in six years, from 77.1 in September, with more than 70 per cent of the purchasing executives surveyed saying they had paid higher prices for their raw materials. Mr Kauffman said, however, that competitive pressures were still preventing many manufacturers from passing on price increases to their own customers. At the same time, executives said one of their most pressing concerns was that their suppliers' deliveries were becoming much slower. Commodities in particularly short supply included paper and cardboard boxes, chemicals such as ethylene, ethylene glycol and glycerine, steel, aluminium and dynamic random access memory chips.</p>

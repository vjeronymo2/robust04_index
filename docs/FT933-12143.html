			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: Alleviating a struggle Sir, Yet again, you carry an article - by Vaclav Klaus - criticising the effectiveness of western support for the development of central and eastern Europe (Personal View, July 19). As a manager working with projects for that part of the world, I am aware of the conflicts with which any development agency has to struggle. It seems to me the time-scale for conversion to market economies is too long for most western financial institutions, including the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. There is little possibility of establishing 'regional planning studies' Klaus refers to without some basic economic stimulus upon which to base mid-term projections. As I previously suggested (Letters, May 27), industry needs support for the 'exceptional' costs it has to incur as a price of entry to the area  - not merely loan programmes, but full-blown subsidy. The UK's Know-How-Fund makes a valiant effort with limited resources - the EC's PHARE assistance programme has yet to break through into industrial development. Until significant amounts of the 'political' aid programmes are diverted to these requirements, our neighbours in the east will struggle to achieve adequate levels of inward investment.

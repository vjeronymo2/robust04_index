			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Nabil Ghzawi] </F>   [Excerpt] Egyptian Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi has  ruled out the convocation of an Arab summit at present to end  Arab differences and rearrange the Arab house. He said that  convening such a summit now is difficult and that it will be  held only when all outstanding issues among the Arab countries  are settled.    In an interview with AL-DUSTUR at the end of his Jordan  visit, Dr. Sidqi said Egypt welcomes reviving Arab solidarity  among the fraternal Arab countries and unifiying efforts in this  respect. He said his country supports the efforts the Arab  League, in the person of its secretary general, has exerted to  mend the rift among these fraternal countries.    On whether there are any new Egyptian moves to activate the  peace process on the Arab-Israeli tracks following the  successful signing of the Cairo agreement between the  Palestinians and the Israelis, Dr. 'Atif Sidqi said Egypt  continues to exert efforts because it seeks a comprehensive and  just settlement for the cause. He said: What has been achieved  on the Palestinian-Israeli track is a step on the road to a just  and comprehensive settlement on all tracks.    On the efforts and contacts to contain the Yemeni crisis,  Dr.  Sidqi said he has been in contact with the Jordanian officials  during his stay in Amman to contain this fighting. He said:  The bleeding started while we were in Jordan. He added: We in  Egypt carry out an important role through personal envoys of  President Husni Mubarak to Yemen and to other important parties  to settle this crisis.    Dr. 'Atif Sidqi said: In light of our general policy, our  stand is that we do not like to see Arabs use weapons against  other Arabs. That's why our stand in Egypt in such cases is to  try to have the parties negotiate to bring their viewpoints  closer together in a peaceful, objective, and constructive  manner.

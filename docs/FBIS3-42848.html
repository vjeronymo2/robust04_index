Korolev; place and date not  given: "There Are No Secret Lobbyists Among Us..."]    [Text] No election platform, no statements or  promises from party leaders will tell more about the party  itself than its election slate. Drawing up this slate is  difficult, painstaking, and not always pleasant work, and it is  better for the voters not to know all the details of what goes  on in the kitchen. They are offered the dish already prepared.  This interview with Tudor Olaru, deputy chairman of the Agrarian  Democratic Party of Moldova, was prepared before the slate of  candidate deputies from this party was registered with the  Central Electoral Commission and published in the newspapers,  but nobody made any secret of it--at a meeting of the ADPM  council on 4 January the composition of the slate was discussed  openly, so there was reason for discussing it.    [Korolev] Mr. Olaru, the slate of candidates from your party  is not very similar to the slate of the Agrarians. Everyone is  included here, there are even leaders and members of the current  government.    [Olaru] If you have read our party's program attentively you  will know that its main objective is to achieve real sovereignty  and independence of Moldova, that is, the construction of a new  state. Therefore we need not only agricultural specialists but  also lawyers, economists, practical businessmen, and scientists.  Some 10 percent of the candidates from the ADPM are lawyers and  approximately the same number are economists.    [Korolev] What was the principle on which the slate was  formed?    [Olaru] The main principle was representation of all rayon  and city party organizations. This, incidentally, pertains to  members of government as well: Sangheli was nominated by Riscani  Rayon, Oleinic--by Balti, Gorincioi--by Chisinau, Kunev--by the  Bulgarian villages of Taraclia and Ciadir-Lunga rayons. Now it  is easy to gain points by criticizing the government, but there  is a proverb: For every one that is beaten there are two that  are not. Our proposals have also been accepted by people who are  simply well known in the republic, for example, the chief  physician of the republic clinical hospital of Moshniaga, the  vice president of the Academy of Sciences of Moldova Lupascu,  and Ion Surucanu, who needs no introduction.    [Korolev] Are there any journalists among the candidates?    [Olaru] Diakov, Angeli...those are the only ones I know of.    [Korolev] Mr. Olaru, as soon as the Law "On Elections" was  adopted, in an interview with our newspaper you gave the name of  the person who should become prime minister in the new  government. Rather, he should remain. Have you changed your mind?    [Olaru] No, I have not changed it. As before, I think that  if  we were to win the elections we should form a government and it  should be headed by Andrei Sangheli. Dumitru Motpan, as the  party's leader, should remain in parliament. In general our  policy with regard to this issue is as follows: Those who are  elected to parliament will work as deputies of parliament. There  are also many worthy people in Moldova who are not on any party  slates. And they must be invited to the government. This does  not mean that none of our candidates will be ministers, but  their number will be limited. There will be three or four and no  more. People are mistaken when they think that when "rushing to  power" the ADPM will give all ministry portfolios to its own  deputies just to "advance" the slate and pack the parliament  with as many of "its own" people as possible.    [Korolev] How many votes does the ADPM hope to receive in  the  elections? I am interested not in your personal prediction but  the minimum number of deputy mandates necessary in order to  uphold the principle of equal representation of all regions of  Moldova. Because if there are any unpleasant surprises, it could  happen that Balti could be represented in parliament by several  deputies from the ADPM while, for example, Singerei or  Soldandesti--by none.    [Olaru] There is no such threshold and therefore, frankly,  the formation of the lower part of the list did not go  altogether smoothly. Incidentally, I dare say that this should  be admitted by all parties. But we want, through our  representative on the Central Electoral Commission, to make a  proposal that each party after receiving a certain number of  positions in parliament decide for itself who should hold them.  Regardless of where the candidate stands on the slate, first or  140th. It seems to me that this would be fair. I hope the rest  of the parties will support us.    [Korolev] It is no secret that private entrepreneurial  structures are very interested in the elections. They are trying  to insert their "candidates" first on one party slate then on  another. Has the ADPM received similar proposals?    [Olaru] Yes, there have been such proposals, and sometimes  in  fairly veiled form. We do not have our own secret service or  counterintelligence, but we have tried not to give in to  pressure from the outside. There are no secret mafia lobbyists  or anyone like that among us. That can be ruled out.</p>

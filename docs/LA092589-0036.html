			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The Legislature might be gone for the year, but rats are still roaming the  Capitol. Four "formidable-sized rats" have been trapped in the last few days,  says Bob Connelly, the Capitol's administrative officer. "We've always had  mice, as well as crickets and wasps," he said. "But the rats were kind of like  the Phantom of the Opera. . . . It was like the Loch Ness monster, where  everyone knew someone who had seen it, but nobody had actually seen it  himself." A pest-control firm was hired and set traps and put down a  rodenticide, he said. Three rats were trapped and killed in the Assembly Ways  and Means Committee room and another was found in the basement, Connelly said.  </P></p>

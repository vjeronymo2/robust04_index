			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Australia looks at ABB offer THE State Energy Commission of Western Australia said yesterday it would consider a revised proposal from Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), the Swiss/Swedish engineering group, to develop a ADollars 2bn (Pounds 840m) power station, writes Kevin Brown from Sydney. The project appeared close to collapse two weeks ago after the state government indicated that it would not accept ABB's proposed electricity prices, or its attempts to win state-government financial support. The commission said a revised bid would be considered by a special board meeting next week.</p>

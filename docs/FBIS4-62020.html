			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent] </F>   [Text] Bonn May 11 -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said  today that Germany will discuss the possibility of providing  further support to Russia and promoting its integration into the  world economy at the forthcoming group of seven ("G-7")  industrial leading countries of the world summit scheduled to be  held in Naples (Italy) in July. Kohl was speaking at a supper  hosted by him in honour of Russian President Boris Yeltsin at  the Petersberg Government Residency today.    The chancellor emphasised that the German people are for new  democratic Russia's integration into the circle of democratic  industrial states. This is the reason why the Germans favoured  Russia's inclusion, as broadly as possible, into the political  part of the "G-7" summit, he said. According to him, Germany's  Western partners expect from Russia constructive cooperation in  settling European and international crises.    Helmut Kohl recalled that the last of the Russian troops  will  leave the German territory in August this year. "This will not  only be drawing a line under the post-war history of Europe. We  are united in saying that this gives our countries a special  opportunity for strengthening and widening new friendship and  partnership. That is why we wish to mark the withdrawal of  Russian military personnel together in a solemn and fitting  form," he said.</p>

Pinnell, a senior and former Valhalla High standout, hit .280 with  two homers and 24 RBIs. Brown, a senior, was 10-5 with a 2.98 earned-run  average.  </P> <P> Brown was a first-team selection last season and the WAC newcomer of the year.  Miller and Pinnell were on the second team last year.  </P> <P> Outfielder Jeff Barry, a first-team selection last season, made the second  team. First baseman Harry Henderson and pitcher Dave Riddle were named  honorable mention. Brigham Young pitcher John DeSilva (16-2) was named WAC  player of the year.  </P> <P> SDSU finished at 37-25. WAC champion Hawaii (40-25) received an automatic berth  into the NCAA tournament. BYU, the regular-season champion, was chosen as an  at-large team based on its 47-18 record. JIM LINDGREN  </P></p>

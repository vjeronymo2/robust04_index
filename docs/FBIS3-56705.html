			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Stupishin, Russian ambassador </F> extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Armenia, by Karen Topchyan  in Yerevan; date not given: "Our Countries Are Allies, the  Russian Ambassador to Armenia Believes"]    [Text] The topic of conversation between ROSSIYSKAYA  GAZETA's own correspondent in Yerevan and Vladimir Stupishin,  Russian Federation ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary  to Armenia, was the relationship between the two countries in  the context of Moscow's geopolitical interests in the  Transcaucasus.    [Topchyan] Is it possible to speak of relations of alliance  between Armenia and Russia?    [Stupishin] Of course, and this is why. The Treaty of  Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Security between Russia and  Armenia was signed back in December 1991. Although it has not  for various reasons been ratified, our two states are  nonetheless implementing many articles of this treaty in other  agreements. In addition, state delegations are functioning  highly actively in order to conduct talks between the two  countries and to prepare bilateral agreements on specific  questions.    Further, Russia and Armenia are parties to the Collective  Security Treaty concluded among certain CIS member countries.  It is a treaty of alliance and provides precisely for alliance  commitments. In addition, a treaty has been signed on the  status of the Russian troops in Armenia -- Russian troops are  stationed in this country, serve here, hold exercises.... This  treaty also governs certain parameters of our military  cooperation. Finally, in accordance with the Treaty on the  Status of the Border Troops, Russian border guards guard the  common borders of the CIS in this area along with their Armenian  colleagues.    [Topchyan] Mr. Ambassador, there is a quite widespread  opinion that Russia, which has perfectly explicable geopolitical  and strategic interests in the Transcaucasus, relies in its  policy in this region on Armenia as its traditional ally. Does  Moscow really have priorities in the Transcaucasus?    [Stupishin] As a region which for long years was  incorporated in the Russian Empire and then in the Soviet Union  and as a region inhabited by peoples who have built a joint life  over centuries, the Transcaucasus is undoubtedly a sphere of  Russia's state interests. I believe that it is not quite  accurate simply to say that Russia relies on one republic.  Rather, we are relying on new treaty relations. It so happens  that Russia was one of the first to start building such  relations with Armenia. Owing to the different nature of the  regimes which have been established in the Transcaucasus and the  different approaches in their attitudes to Russia and the CIS,  new relations have been established juridically with other  Transcaucasian republics either later or somewhat differently.    Quite honestly, your question contains a somewhat  frightening  expression which can be understood as...: Russia relies on just  one country in the Transcaucasus. Does this mean with it  against the others? Russia's policy is not quite like that; it  is different, in fact. It means with this country, but not  against the others. We also seek to organize good-neighborly  relations with the others. For Russia has an interest in  ensuring that its closest neighbors are able to build their  lives under peaceful conditions. The normal development of  Russia itself depends on this. The bloody conflicts in various  parts of the former USSR damage our economic interests as well  as those of others. Russia therefore seeks to help everywhere  and to be of service in settling conflicts.    [Topchyan] Incidentally, please tell us about Russia's  role in settling the Karabakh conflict.    [Stupishin] Obviously, in seeking to help find political  means to resolve that conflict Russia acts in the role of a  go-between. As the experience of the past few months shows, it  is precisely these peacemaking efforts and the readiness shown  last summer by both Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan to come to  the negotiating table that have, in fact, brought the first  positive results in the form of a cease-fire.    [Topchyan] Many people believe that Russia is interested  only in "freezing" the Karabakh conflict -- and not just the  Karabakh conflict....    [Stupishin] Russia sets itself no such goal. What does  "freezing" mean? A cease-fire -- and everything is postponed  indefinitely? Our aim is to bring all conflicts, at least those  on the territory of the former Union, to a peaceful political  settlement. A genuine settlement implies using a cease-fire as  a means of creating favorable conditions for a process of  negotiation.    [Topchyan] What is the state of Russian-Armenian relations,  and what are the prospects?    [Stupishin] They can be described very positively. They are  developing normally. The existing difficulties are primarily of  a technical nature. They are also connected with the fact that  we are living through a period of the breakup of the Soviet  structure and the building of new relations both within the CIS  framework and on a bilateral basis.</p>

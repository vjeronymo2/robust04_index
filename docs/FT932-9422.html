			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Oslo outrage at EC oil and gas proposals: PM condemns licensing plans NORWAY'S government yesterday expressed strong disapproval of European Community plans to introduce an oil and gas licensing directive when it is struggling to convince a resistant electorate of the benefits of EC entry. In its membership application Norway made clear it expected to voice an opinion on formulating Europe's future energy policy. Its position should be given considerable weight in proposals for the regulation of licences for exploration and exploitation. Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norwegian prime minister, said that her country, as western Europe's biggest oil producer and main supplier of natural gas, took a keen interest in all European moves and measures relating to energy. 'We do not view the introduction of this proposal as a very positive move before Norway might be joining the Community,' she said. 'The situation reminds us of 1972 when the EC adopted a fisheries policy shortly before Norway was going to make the decision on whether to become a member of the EC. That move in itself had a considerable impact on the Norwegian referendum.' Norwegian voters rejected EC membership in 1972  - mainly because of the fish issue  - in a bitterly devisive referendum. It began fresh membership negotiations with the Community last month. Norway finds it difficult to understand the need for a licensing directive. 'On the contrary,' said Mrs Brundtland, 'it may damage the image of the Community among the people in Norway in the run-up to a new referendum.' The proposed directive would have considerable impact on Norway and little or negligible impact on most EC countries, the prime minister said.</p>

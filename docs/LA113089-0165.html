			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Nikon Not In Perkin-Elmer Talks: Nikon Corp. said it is not in talks and has no  plans to acquire Perkin-Elmer Corp.'s semiconductor manufacturing equipment  division, although it was in such talks earlier this year. The Japanese camera  maker said it broke off talks in part because of concern about American  reaction to another Japanese company buying a key U.S. technology firm.  However, Perkin-Elmer is having difficulty finding a U.S. bidder for the unit,  one of the few U.S. firms that produces equipment for manufacturing computer  chips.  </P></p>

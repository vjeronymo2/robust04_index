			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source at the Ministry of Defense has  categorically denied that the forces of the adventurous and  bloody al-Ahmar gang have seized al-'Anad base. The source also  denied that any units of the forces of unity, democracy, and  modernization or any of their men had surrendered as claimed by  self-deluded military sources in Sanaa.    The responsible source at the Ministry of Defense said the  forces of unity, democracy, and modernization were fighting  heroic defensive battles in the direction of the  Karish-al-Rahidah area. They were registering immortal results  and achieving sweeping victories about which we need not boast  as is done by the news media of the criminal gang of al-Ahmar.    It concerns us to confirm, however, to our Yemeni people and  Arab and international public that we are fighting a battle to  defend our people's dignity and hordes and their right to a free  and decent life. Our forces are resisting with rare courage and  bravery beyond description the barbaric hordes pushed by the  al-Ahmar gang into the option of: the enemy is before you and  the sea is behind you. We have only one option: a free and  decent life. Victory is our ally and God is great.</p>

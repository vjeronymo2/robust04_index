			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Director bought power shares ahead of review Mr Denis Cassidy, a non-executive director of Seeboard, the electricity distribution company, bought 5,000 shares in the company at 382p each only three days before release of an electricity industry price review. Seeboard's shares closed yesterday at 414p, up 18p on the day. On Thursday the price of shares in Seeboard and the 11 other regional electricity companies in England and Wales soared after the publication of a report by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, which showed price controls as less onerous than had recently been thought likely. The Stock Exchange is understood to have been investigating dealing in the shares of the companies before the release of the report and is said to have shown particular interest in share purchases by directors. Some directors may have had advance reports of Prof Littlechild's recommendations because they participated in the pricing review, although non-executives such as Mr Cassidy are much less likely to have been involved. Separately, the Stock Exchange is understood to be examining trading in shares of the companies by brokers, some of whom are believed to have obtained advance copies of the report. Seeboard said that Mr Cassidy, who is also chairman of Boddington, the pubs group, had sought the approval of Seeboard's board to purchase the shares, in line with board policy. He joined the board as a non-executive director in May and owns no other Seeboard shares. There is no evidence that Mr Cassidy had any advance knowledge of the contents of the Littlechild report. Explaining the purchase, Seeboard said that having joined recently as a non-executive director 'he was showing a long-term commitment to the company'. It was not immediately clear why the board sanctioned a purchase of company shares just days before the release of a price-sensitive document likely to affect the company's future profits. The company declined to make any other comment on the matter. The Stock Exchange has an unofficial policy of closely monitoring trading in a company's shares in the days leading up to the release of price-sensitive information. The review is regarded as highly favourable for all the electricity companies. Analysts are divided on how Seeboard fared, with some saying that it did relatively badly and others taking the contrary view. Among the investment community the company enjoys one of the best ratings of all the 12 regional companies.</p>

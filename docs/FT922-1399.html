			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / De Klerk to chair talks on political turmoil SOUTH AFRICAN president FW de Klerk announced yesterday he would cut short a visit to Spain and return in time to chair a cabinet meeting tomorrow which will address the country's political turmoil. Mr de Klerk's move follows a decision by the African National Congress, which on Sunday cut off bilateral talks with the government, to convene an emergency national executive committee meeting today. The organisation attacked Mr de Klerk yesterday for his insensitivity in leaving the country at such a time. The ANC will discuss its response to last week's massacre of 42 people at Boipatong, near Johannesburg. It blames the attack on the Zulu-based Inkatha movement, and is incensed that three more were killed on Saturday by police who opened fire on a crowd soon after Mr de Klerk aborted a visit to the township. The ANC, is expected either to suspend temporarily its participation in Convention for a Democratic South Africa - the constitutional negotiating forum made up of 19 political parties - or to make further participation contingent on how the government responds to the massacre. South African financial markets reacted nervously yesterday to the deteriorating political mood. Worst affected was the financial rand, the investment currency for foreigners, which fell by 6.7 per cent from Friday's close to finish at R3.84 to the dollar. The discount to the commercial rand widened to 27 per cent, the highest it has been this year. On the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the overall index closed at 3,639, down 42 points or more than 1 per cent. The ANC executive meeting comes against the backdrop of the worst crisis in the negotiation process since the unbanning of the ANC in February 1990. There were, however, hints from both sides yesterday that they may be seeking to pull back from the brink. Mr Tertius Delport, the government's spokesman on Codesa, said it would be a 'tragedy' if the ANC was to pull out of the forum. 'That would be putting us back a lot . . . we would be very disappointed if the ANC would entertain the idea.' Mr Delport said an invitation to the ANC by Mr Pik Botha, foreign minister and acting president in Mr de Klerk's absence, to join the government in talks was an effort to move forward. Professor Kadar Asmal, a member of the ANC executive, said the organisation was 'firmly committed' to negotiations but added the way out of the impasse was to move quickly to an interim government. Investment analysts think the equity market will probably continue to move lower until there is evidence that Codesa is back on track. Mr Mike Soekoe, chief dealer at stockbroker Simpson McKie, said it had been a very nervous day with volumes low and few people keen to buy. Britain urged all sides to return to the negotiating table. Mr John Major, the prime minister, was said to be 'very distressed' at the events. Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Mr Steve Tshwete, ANC sports spokesman, both called into question South Africa's participation in the Barcelona Olympics.

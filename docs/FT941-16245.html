			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Vienna airport stake disposal The Austrian government plans to sell at least half of its 36.5 per cent stake in Flughaven Wien, the Vienna airport company, as soon as possible, the finance ministry said yesterday. Flughaven Wien was partially privatised in 1992 with the sale of 27 per cent of its share capital. The City of Vienna and the Province of Lower Austria each have 18.25 per cent stakes in the airport. The privatisation will be either through a flotation on the stock exchange, a direct sale to a trade buyer, or a combination of both, the official said. Lazard Brothers of London are advisers, and a decision on the method of privatisation will depend on market conditions and whether Lazard can find a suitable foreign buyer, the official said. Based on the current price of Vienna Airport shares of just under Sch600 per nominal share of Sch100, the government could hope to raise around Sch2.2bn (Dollars 185m) from the sale of 18.25 per cent of the company.</p>

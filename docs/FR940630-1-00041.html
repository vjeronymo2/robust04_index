			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation, Regulatory Flexibility Determination, and Trade Impact Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed changes to Federal regulations must undergo several economic analyses. First, Executive Order 12866 directs that each Federal agency shall propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits of the intended regulation justify its costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to analyze the economic effect of regulatory changes on small entities. Third, the Office of Management and Budget directs agencies to assess the effects of regulatory changes on international trade. In conducting these analyses, the FAA has determined that this rule: (1) Would generate benefits that would justify its costs and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' as defined in the Executive Order; (2) is not ``significant'' as defined in DOT's Policies and Procedures; (3) would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities; and (4) would not constitute a barrier to international trade. These analyses, available in the docket, are summarized below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation Summary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA has determined that the benefits of the proposed rule, though not directly quantifiable, would exceed the expected costs. Minor costs, ranging from $240 to $6,000 per certification, are projected for four of the provisions in this proposal. No costs are attributed to the other thirty-two provisions. The benefits of the proposed rule are considered below in four categories: (1) harmonization, (2) safety, (3) reduced need for special conditions, and (4) clarification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Harmonization <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule, in concert with other rulemaking and policy actions, would provide nearly uniform powerplant airworthiness standards for airplanes certificated in the United States and the JAA member countries. Thirty-four of the thirty-six sections affected by the proposed rule would be harmonized. The resulting greater uniformity of standards would simplify airworthiness approval for import and export purposes and reduce the cost of certification for airplanes seeking certification under both sets of regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Safety <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the harmonization benefits, five proposed changes would provide additional safety benefits. First, the proposed rule would revise &sect;23.933(a)(1) to more closely agree with the corresponding turbojet and turbofan reversing system airworthiness standards of part 25. The FAA estimates that this provision would necessitate an additional 100 hours of failure mode and effects analysis at an assumed cost rate of $60 per hour, including labor and overhead. The estimated $6,000 cost would apply to each certification. The FAA projects that no additional production or operating costs would result from this provision. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

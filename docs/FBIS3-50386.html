This means that the  results of the struggle should be recognized: not only those of  the Muslim side, but also those of all the sides in the conflict.    "The Supreme Command adopted a decision about strict legal  measures against deserters and all other persons avoiding  military service, especially those who do not report to their  local commands or army units at the earliest opportunity.    "The economy of the Srpska republic will be placed entirely  at the disposal of the republic's defense.    "The entire able-bodied population will be mobilized into  war  or work units, and special women's units will be set up with the  aim of bringing about a successful end to the war.    "All forms of illegal trade and black marketeering,  especially with the enemy, will be severely punished.    "Disciplinary measures have been intensified within the VRS  and in the internal affairs' organs [police], as well as against  all those involved in the defense, security, and protection of  the constitutional order. [sentence as received]    "All state organs must function in accordance with their  constitutional and legal role, bringing all forms of criminal,  moral, disciplinary, and other proceedings in line with  conditions of an immediate risk of war.    "The Supreme Command has undertaken all measures ensuring  and  guaranteeing full security for citizens and their property.    "New measures have been taken within the organization of the  VRS in line with the defense needs of all of the Srpska republic  territory, ensuring flexibility, efficiency, and the better  equiping of the army's units.    "The Supreme Command also adopted other decisions to ensure  that the fundamental right and the sacred duty of citizens will  be implemented: to defend the sovereignty, territory, and  constitutional order of the Srpska republic.    "The new measures of the VRS Supreme Command will secure  victory over the enemy and preserve all of the gains of the  Serbian people's struggle to date, based on the principles of  sovereignty, democracy, and freedom of the people in the Srpska  republic," the statement concludes.</p>

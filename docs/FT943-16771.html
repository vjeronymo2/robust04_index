			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / International Company News: NTT to list on UK and US markets Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the Japanese telecommunications group with a stock market capitalisation of Dollars 137bn, plans to list its shares on the New York and London stock exchanges later this year. The move comes at a time of increasing interest in Japanese shares among European and US investors. Although it has no immediate fund-raising plans, NTT said the move would provide better corporate information and boost fundraising capabilities in overseas financial markets. The barriers to foreign investment in NTT, which was privatised in 1985, were lifted in 1992. Foreign ownership totals 1.3 per cent of the group's 15.6m outstanding shares. NTT's listing will be the first by a Japanese company in London since Kobe Steel in September 1992. SG Warburg, NTT's sponsor for the listing, said the number of Japanese comp-anies indicating interest in similar moves was increasing. So far, 29 Japanese companies are listed on the London exchange. However, the sharp fall in corporate earnings during the past few years has slowed the trend. NTT, in which the Japanese Ministry of Finance has a 66 per cent shareholding, said it would apply for a listing to the NYSE this month and to the LSE in October. Tokyo investors welcomed the move. NTT shares rose Y6,000 to Y881,000 yesterday on hopes of an increased investor base for the company.</p>

South Korea said the exchange of special envoys is designed  to seek a peaceful settlement of the nuclear dispute through  dialogue and to pave way for improving the South-North relations.    The proposal was made by South Korean vice minister of  national unification and chief delegate of the South in  inter-korean talks, Song Yong-tae, in a telephone message to his  DPRK counterpart, Pak Yong-su.    Song proposed that the meeting begin from 10 a.m. March 1 at  the "House of Peace" on the southern side of the Panmunjom  military demarcation line.    He hoped that both sides could reach an agreement as soon as  possible on the exchange of envoys.    The DPRK agreed to begin a new round of dialogue with South  Korea in its talks in New York with the United States on  February 26, on the condition that South Korea proposes it first.    The two sides have held three rounds of talks on the  exchange  of envoys but failed to reach agreement owing to their  differences over the timing of the exchange, the envoys'  responsibility, and the agenda.    The last meeting was held on October 25 last year on the  northern side of the Panmunjom demarcation line.</p>

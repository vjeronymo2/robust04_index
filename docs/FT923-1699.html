			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Arts: New Beginnings - Weekend concerts Kent Nagano, chief conductor-designate of the Halle Orchestra, has been touring the country with his new orchestra. On Sunday they arrived home at the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, for a concert (broadcast on Radio 3) which was terrifically exhilarating not just in itself but for what it portends. It was an ambitious programme  - works by Messiaen and John Adams (composers with whose music the young American conductor has become closely associated) which had been given their British premieres earlier on the tour, plus a lightly glittering account of the complete Stravinsky Firebird score. All the pieces were executed with exactly the cool confidence and flair that have been missing in the portfolio of Halle attributes recently. Nagano, as he told radio listeners in an interval talk, has discerned a pressing need to re-create the quality of imagination in this orchestra's programming; it is to this end that his opening series, under the sub-title 'New Beginnings', has been directed. The first half, its two offerings, each an attractive contrast with the other, certainly proved the point. Un Sourire (1989) is the penultimate composition to have been completed before Messiaen's death earlier this year. It is a tiny (5-minute) marvel of 'late-music' economy and radiance. Two strands of Messiaenic thought, the hymnally lyrical and the birdsong-percussive, are set in block alternation, then brought to repose. Adams, composer of Nixon in China and The Death of Klinghoffer, approaches his big projects with big confidence; the huge orchestra for Eldorado (1991), including two synthesisers, wastes no colour-device. This two-movement symphony  - self-proclaimed rather than immediately evident as such  - treats with disquieted irony, as well as picturesqueness, two aspects of West Coast existence. The movements are two different sound-landscapes: the first, called 'The Dream of Gold', builds up baleful neo-Shostakovich sonorities; the second, 'Soledades', gradually fills its empty space with tingling, desert-inspired patterns. Adams, now firmly into his post-minimalist phase, layers his much-repeated rhythmic and colouristic figures in the manner that appears to draw on Baroque and various 20th-century (including rock) modes of articulation equally: his musical language proceeds in cells of activity forming foundation pillars to support spans of lyrical line. The idiom is unfailingly appealing, easy to absorb. What troubles me  - here as in the past  - is the arrival of climactic gestures produced less out of the heat of argument than through mechanical assembly. Eldorado is a superb concatenation of applique effects announcing itself up as something altogether weightier. Meanwhile, last Thursday and Friday in the Festival Hall there were also New Beginnings  - of a rather less confidence-inducing kind. The London Philharmonic Orchestra celebrated its newly achieved position as resident orchestra of the London South Bank Centre with two concerts of triple-decker form and three-hour length. If the aim of their programme was to suggest the different kinds of promise for the future that the orchestra now holds under its chief conductor, Franz Welser-Most, its damp-squib impact must already be raising anxious eyebrows. To put it bluntly, the concert was either absurdly ill-planned or all too deftly designed to demonstrate Welser-Most's interpretative immaturity. The centrepiece, the Schumann Second Symphony, received a glaring performance, loveless, lumpy and driven. Unsparkling, bandmasterly accounts of Prokofiev's Three Oranges Suite and (as encore) the Fledermaus Overture sank spirits ever lower. The message, alas, seems to be that a highly talented young conductor learning on the job is not well placed to lead an orchestra many people still consider London's top-class ensemble into its much-vaunted New Era.

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Towry Law shares tumble 44p following loss warning Shares in Towry Law dropped 44p to 86p yesterday after the independent financial advice group warned that it expected losses of Pounds 1.25m at the half year, compared with pre-tax profits of Pounds 565,000. Mr Alan Wesley, chief executive, said poor stock market conditions had made investors nervous about making new commitments. The company has also been affected by the public's loss of confidence in financial advice following adverse publicity. However, Mr Wesley said that provisions made at the full year to cover the extra costs of complying with SIB requirements on the review of pension transfer business would not be needed. The company now expects to review 500 cases rather than the previous estimate of 1,600, and it does not expect the impact of the review to be material. Trading income in the first four months of the year was down 10 per cent, with the biggest decline in investment products. Pension income has remained steady, while general insurance business is 10 per cent lower. The company has accelerated a cost-cutting programme which had already been planned; it warned in September that it would affect profitability in the first half. Staff numbers are to be reduced by 15 per cent in the 12 months to July 1 1995, through compulsory redundancies and natural wastage. About half that target has already been met. The cost-cutting programme is also intended to cope with the effect of higher compliance and disclosure standards from the new year. Mr Cecil Law, chairman, said it was intended to maintain the interim dividend due in April 1995. There are few other quoted IFAs, but the impact of industry-wide poor market conditions, adverse public perceptions and regulatory changes is likely be even more severe on smaller firms.</p>

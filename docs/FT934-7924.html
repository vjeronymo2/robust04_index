			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Pact ushers in government of national unity: New constitution at a glance POWER-SHARING There will be a government of national unity, with a cabinet composed of all parties winning more than 5 per cent of the national vote, allocated seats proportionately. The president will be elected by the national assembly. The first deputy president, who will act as prime minister, will come from the majority party; there will be a second deputy president from the second largest party (probably the National Party). Cabinet decisions will be by consensus but where impossible, the president's view will prevail. The principle of a government of national unity cannot be changed until 1999. REGIONAL POWERS The constitution provides for significant devolution of power to provincial governments in areas such as education, health, welfare, policing, etc, but central government reserves powers to intervene to impose uniform national standards, to regulate provincial activities and where national economic policy or security is affected. Provincial governments can impose no taxes without national assembly approval though they will be guaranteed a share of national revenue. PARLIAMENT Parliament will write a new constitution to replace yesterday's interim constitution, and act simultaneously as the first non-racial legislature. There will be two houses: a 400-member national assembly elected by proportional representation from a party list, with half the representatives from a national list and half from regional lists. In addition, there will be a senate composed of 10 members from each of the 9 provinces, elected by members of the provincial legislatures. When acting as a constituent assembly, parliament will take decisions by two thirds majority and will be constrained by constitutional principles set out in the interim constitution. If the constituent assembly cannot agree by two thirds majority within two years, there will be a referendum requiring a 60 per cent vote. If this is not achieved the constituent assembly will continue seeking agreement for a further three years with a 60 per cent majority required. When acting as a legislature, a simple majority suffices though constitutional amendments and bills affecting the powers of provincial governments must pass by a two thirds majority of both houses. PROVINCIAL LEGISLATURES Elections will be held simultaneously for provincial assemblies of 30-100 members elected by proportional representation from a party list. Provincial assemblies may write a constitution for each province. BILL OF RIGHTS Fundamental human rights will be protected under an interim bill of rights which permits, though it does not enforce, affirmative action and promises 'just and equitable' compensation in the event of expropriation of property. Compensation disputes will be settled by the courts, taking into account market value of property, its use and the history of its acquisition. CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES Enshrine basic principles under which the new constitution must be written: these include independence of the judiciary, devolution of power to provincincial government, and basic human rights. LANGUAGE South Africa is to have 11 official languages, but in practice English is likely to be the language of government. LOCAL GOVERNMENT Local government will be transformed more slowly than national government. Local negotiating forums or 'councils of local unity' will oversee the two-year transition to local government elections, with the rights of property owners even after elections protected by a formula which ensures that whites will have disproportionate representation. CIVIL SERVICE Pensions of civil servants will be protected in exchange for a deal to bring blacks into the top echelons.</p>

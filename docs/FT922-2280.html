			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Survey of European Building &amp; Construction (6): The pain may linger - The British market remains depressed Britain's tallest building at 800 ft - dominates the skyline of east London. It stands as a massive monument to the failure of the British commercial property market in the late 1980s. The failure of the Canary Wharf project and the collapse of its developer, Olympia &amp; York owned by the Reichmann family, mirrors the misery which has been felt by hundreds of British construction companies and building material suppliers. Just as Centre Point, an office block which remained empty for many years in London's West End, became a symbol of the 1970s property market collapse, so the Canary Wharf tower remains a painful reminder of the precarious nature of speculative development. The pain looks like lingering. Property investors are unlikely to begin new projects while newly-completed office blocks continue to struggle to find tenants. This will hit workloads and depress profitability. Intense competition for a diminishing number of potential contracts has meant that profit margins have fallen sharply for other types of construction work. Contractors which have already cut bids for work as low as possible and still failed to win jobs say that some companies appear to be taking contracts at zero margin or even at a loss. These companies need to keep cash coming in to pay interest payments on borrowings which were raised during the mid to late 1980s when the commercial and residential property markets were at their height. According to a report by the National Economic Develop- ment Office, about 33m sq ft of office space was either empty or available for letting in London at the end of last year. This represented 16 per cent of the total office space in Britain's biggest commercial market and would take six years to occupy at normal rates of take-up. So much space remains empty in London, including large amounts at Canary Wharf, that it could be several years before Britain's biggest commercial property market returns to anything like normality. The effect on contractors and suppliers has been to reduce workloads while those companies which undertook speculative residential and commercial developments saw the value of their investments fall steeply as the cost of the money borrowed to build them went up. Even such companies as Wimpey, Barratt, Costain and Tarmac have been required to make substantial provisions, running into hundreds of millions of pounds, to reflect falls in residential and commercial land and property values since the markets peaked in 1988-89. Dividends have either been cut or have been paid only from reserves. There should be no further write-downs unless there is a further dip in property values. Nevertheless, the outlook for the British construction market remains very depressed - despite signs that a slow thaw may be starting in the housing market. Builders and estate agents say that more people have recently expressed interest in making purchases and visiting houses for sale, but to persuade them to put hard cash on the table remains very difficult. There is often a long lag between expressions of interest and the actual completion of a sale. Purchases often fall down at the last minute and builders say they still have to offer substantial sales incentives in order to complete deals. They are reluctant to talk of the beginnings of a recovery, particularly as house purchases would normally be expected to rise in the spring. Nonetheless, companies such as Wimpey, the country's second largest housebuilder, say that sales have been running at about 10 per cent higher this year compared with the corresponding period last year. Builders remain concerned at margins. One of Britain's biggest construction groups which has a medium-sized housebuilding subsidiary operating mainly in southern England says that it is continuing to sell homes at little or no profit after taking into account interest charges and other overheads. The company is still working through high cost land bought during the late 1980s when house prices were up to 20 per cent higher in south-east England. Average UK house prices have continued to fall during the first half of this year and builders do not expect prices to show any real increase before 1983. Even then, prices may rise only slowly. There is longer-term concern that Britain's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism will result in slower growth in house prices in future as a result of lower general inflation rates. Work for housing associations, however, has increased sharply as public and private sector finance available to associations has risen substantially. The only other glimmer of light in an otherwise gloomy outlook for the sector has been the increased spending by the recently privatised water and power companies which have been catching up with their capital investment, neglected when they were under public ownership. Water companies, in particular, have been spending heavily, to the benefit of tunnelling companies. Competition among contractors, seeking to replace work lost in other areas of construction, has meant that margins even for water and sewerage projects have not been as high as might have been expected. Euro Construct, an organisation representing European construction research agencies and economic forecasting bodies, is expected to forecast today that construction output in the UK will fall by about 5 per cent this year. This would follow a 9 per cent fall last year. The biggest fall is likely to occur in commercial building, mainly offices and shops, where output could decline by more than a fifth this year. Construction of factories and warehouses is also likely to decline as industrial companies continue to hold back from making new investment until they can gauge the strength of the recovery more clearly. The outlook for private industrial work is difficult to determine now that this sector includes water and power companies. Construction of the Channel Tunnel, also classed as private industrial work in Environment Department statistics, is likely to slow however as the building phase of the project is completed. Contractors have also been disappointed that the big increase in road spending by the government at the end of the 1980s has not produced a greater flow of orders. Margins for road work are also depressed, along with much of the rest of construction work. Profits of British construction and building material companies are likely to remain under pressure this year, even though there are unlikely to be any further property write-downs. There is unlikely to be any substantial bounce back next year, with construction output forecast to remain relatively flat in 1993.</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Five die in Senegal poll violence Voting began yesterday in Senegal's presidential election, with separatist violence in the south claiming five more lives, Reuter reports from Dakar. The rebel Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance (MFDC) has vowed to disrupt all political activity in Casamance province, which is practically cut off from the rest of Senegal by Gambia. At least 140 people have been killed since the MFDC stepped up its decade-old rebellion last September. Elsewhere, campaigning has been peaceful. Political analysts say President Abdou Diouf is tipped to win, but the race will probably be close. The spread of candidates, and a new stipulation that the winner must be backed by at least a quarter of the 2.5m registered voters, will probably mean a run off on March 7.</p>

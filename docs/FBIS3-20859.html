Scekic: "Welcome Confederation"] </F>   [Text] Zagreb -- "The Social Democratic Party of Croatia  generally approves of the agreement between Granic and Silajdzic  reached in Washington, but it must note that the present nature  of the agreement is contrary to official Croatian policies as  they have been to this day. Thus it appears to have been imposed  from the outside." That statement was made last Friday at a  press conference by Antun Vujic, president of the party.    Commenting on the agreement, Vujic said that it is almost  identical to the policies of his party in relation to Bosnia and  Herzegovina because the Social Democratic Party of Croatia was  always in favor of recognizing the states formed on the  territory of the former Yugoslavia and the borders between them.  As far as the future confederation of Croatia and Bosnia and  Herzegovina that may eventually happen, the party leader  stressed that it is welcome as an expression of political,  geographic, and economic interests, but it must be founded on  the principle of strict preservation of the sovereignty and  individuality of the two states because too many sacrifices have  been made, and Croatian sovereignty will not be lost easily.  However, the possible confederation must not have any  connection with the confederation of Croatia, because the future  of the UNPA zones can not be resolved in the same package. "The  international community must clearly state what obligations it  has toward the integration of the so-called Krajina with  Croatia," Vujic said.    The merger of SDP (Social Democratic Party) and SDH (Social  Democratic Party of Croatia) was also discussed at the press  conference. Vujic pointed out that the merger provides the  possibility of securing a new political area, and it will create  a strong left on the Croatian political scene, which is very  much needed.</p>

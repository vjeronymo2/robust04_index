			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Good Morning From Mexico" newscast] </F>   [Text] On 23 January three clashes between riot police from  the General Directorate of Public Security and Traffic and over  200 members of the Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD]  occurred in Tlalmanalco, Mexico State. Sixteen persons were  injured -- three of whom were shot -- and 15 were arrested.    The clashes occurred after a group of PRD members blocked  both lanes of the Mexico-Cuautla road to protest the victory of  PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] member Susana Plaza  Aguilar during the 14 November election for a new municipal  president.    Due to this incident, after removing the PRD members,  surveillance was increased at the city council office in  Tlalmanalco to prevent demonstrators from seizing the  installations.</p>

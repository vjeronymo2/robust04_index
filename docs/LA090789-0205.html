			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> TOM JONES TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT  </P> <P> Attorneys for Welsh singer Tom Jones reached tentative agreement today on  child-support payments for a 14-month-old boy the entertainer fathered during a  two-night 1987 visit to Manhattan.  </P> <P> But the settlement failed to assuage the feelings of the child's mother,  Katherine Berkery, 27. "I think he's a disgusting human being," she said after  the agreement was reached during a two-hour, closed-door negotiating session in  Family Court.  </P> <P> Although no support figure was announced, Berkery's lawyer was reportedly  seeking $3,800 a month and Berkery said she was "very happy with what I'm going  to get."  </P></p>

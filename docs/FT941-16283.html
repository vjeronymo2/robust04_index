			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Railtrack chief set to resist track ownership by operators Mr Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, yesterday launched a strong defence of his organisation's role as owner of British Rail's track and signalling. He gave a clear indication that he would strongly resist any attempt by train operators to own track by spelling out the benefits of separating track from the operation of rail services. In a speech to the Chartered Institute of Transport, Mr Horton also publicly committed his company to privatisation - the Treasury favours early privatisation of Railtrack. Mr Horton said: 'There is no need for a commercially driven public sector organisation to be subject to the full detailed panoply of nationalised industry controls, simply because that is the norm. I believe that is now clearly accepted by the government.' He said the advantage of separating the track from the train operators would prove considerable. He said the complexity of contractual relationships was commonplace in industry. He did not mention the Central Railway Group, which has been allowed to negotiate the purchase of track, or the potential bidders for ScotRail, which favour integration, but said there was no logic to such moves. 'There is no necessary logic in vertical integration even when there is a high degree of mutual commercial dependence,' he said. 'The act of separation will enable us to clarify responsibilities and calculate costs, it will make it much easier to obtain value for money.' He argued that separating track ownership from the operation of rail services would give a clear commercial focus to railway activities. Decisions on new track and signalling investment would be made only after detailed analysis of the needs of potential customers. Mr Horton also sent a clear signal that he hopes to expand rail services. 'We want to open up the network to as many new services, freight and passenger, that operators want to provide.' As part of Railtrack's commercial focus it will relate its charges to its performance. If trains are delayed or cancelled because a driver is sick or a locomotive fails, Railtrack would not seek to apportion blame but try to find and agree an explanation to minimise the chances of it happening again. The west coast main line, between London and Glasgow, which the government hopes to modernise with Pounds 400m-Pounds 600m of private sector finance, will serve as a benchmark for the new railway structure, Mr Horton said. He said he was confident 'that by this time next year our plans will be concrete and we will be engaging a consortium to carry out the work.' Mr Horton also revealed that Railtrack would contract out maintainance work to the private sector.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Feb 26 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslems late last  week transported around two thousand of their soldiers to the  battlefronts in central Bosnia through a tunnel under Sarajevo,  the Czech daily LIDOVE NOVINI writes on Saturday.    The daily's special reporter quotes a British U.N.  Protection  Force (UNPROFOR) officer, who asked not to be identified as  saying that the Moslems have connected a tunnel under the  Sarajevo airport in the southern section of the city with  another in northern Sarajevo, whose locality as yet remains  unknown.    Following a meeting with the UNPROFOR command, the same  source said, the Moslem side agreed to place both tunnels under  UNPROFOR's "discreet control," the daily says.    Bosnian Serbs several months ago warned that the Moslems had  dug a tunnel under the UNPROFOR-controlled Sarajevo airport to  be used as a conduit for arms and ammunition deliveries and  transportation of troops.    However, Bosnian Serbs and Croats have for the past few days  been stressing that the Moslem side has taken advantage of the  Serb-Moslem ceasefire in the Sarajevo area to evacuate its  troops and have them transferred to central Bosnia to help step  up an offensive against Bosnian Croats.</p>

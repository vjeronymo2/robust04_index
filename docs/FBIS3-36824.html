Russian Federation Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev on the New Tasks of Russian Foreign Policy"]    [Text] Russian diplomacy has entered the new year, 1994,  with a wide agenda for both the immediate and medium term.    The consistent orientation of our foreign policy toward the  promotion of national interests through openness and cooperation  with the outside world strengthens Russia's positions in the  international arena and creates a favorable climate for internal  development. At the same time the end of the Cold War certainly  does not mean that international relations have become idyllic.  The emerging multipolar world is in many ways more complex and  unpredictable than the old bipolar world. Instead of two rival  blocs there exist many "centers of influence" with different and  sometimes competing interests. New threats to our interests are  appearing, above all in connection with instability and armed  conflict in the area of the former USSR.    In these conditions we are faced with the task of  energetically -- and where necessary, uncompromisingly --  defending and promoting our interests, while, of course,  remaining within the bounds of international law and the search  for a rational balance of interests.    In order to carry out this policy we need a robust  democratic  state system. The new Russian Constitution creates the  necessary prerequisites for this. Foreign policy remains in the  president's hands, which rules out its invasion by  manifestations of adventurism and self-interest.    In the practical sphere we shall operate in the following  main areas.    In the past two years Russia has concluded dozens of  bilateral treaties and agreements, joined the key international  economic organizations, and acquired a whole series of partners  in various regions of the world. Now these accords must be  given substance. This is not a departmental, but a statewide  task.    In the sphere of national security our priorities will be,  as  before, to eliminate hotbeds of armed conflict along Russia's  borders, to reinforce the arrangements relating to the  nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the latest  military technologies, and to increase the accountabilty and  transparency of the international arms trade, while  unconditionally safeguarding our commercial interests in this  sphere.    The START II treaty and the Convention on the Prohibition of  Chemical Weapons need to be brought into force. The former  Supreme Soviet ducked out of ratifying these important  disarmament treaties. I hope that the Federal Assembly will  approach this question with more responsibility and with less  prejudice, especially as it is a question of an important phase  of the implementation of Russia's new military doctrine. The  agreement between the Russian Federation, the United States, and  Ukraine on the total elimination of strategic nuclear weapons on  Ukrainian territory signed in Moscow creates a favorable climate  for the ratification of the START II treaty.    We will concentrate our efforts on the all-around  development  of the CIS and its speedy transformation into a full-fledged  regional organization with an increasing level of economic  integration and political cooperation. The opportunities  presented by the Russian chairmanship of the Commonwealth in the  first half of this year will be actively exploited to achieve  this task.    The defense of the rights of the Russian-speaking  population remains of paramount importance. In 1992-1993 the  government was forced to spend 51.5 billion rubles on catering  for refugees and persons forced to emigrate from regions of  interethnic tension and conflict. Hence not only humanitarian  principles, but also the country's pragmatic interests oblige us  to ensure that UN and CSCE standards in the sphere of human and  national minority rights are genuinely observed in the CIS and  the Baltic region. It is important to speed up the "launch" of  Commonwealth human rights protection mechanisms -- first and  foremost a CIS Commission for Human Rights.    Russia finds equally unacceptable both "neo-imperialist" and  isolationist approaches to problems in the former USSR, where we  find concentrated not only our vital interests but also the main  sources of threats to these interests and, at the same time,  great opportunities for cooperation. Russia objectively carries  a special responsibility for maintaining peace and stability in  this huge area. We will persistently seek to increase the CIS'  peace-making potential and to further cooperation in  strengthening its external borders. Special attention will be  devoted to conflict regions and to Tajikistan, where dialogue  between the government and the political opposition must finally  get started.    In the European sphere our central task is to participate in  building a peaceful, democratic, united Europe. The main  instrument in the political sphere is to be the CSCE, and in the  military sphere, the North Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC],  which could act as the coordinator of the work of the regional  organizations of NATO, the Western European Union, and the CIS  in the sphere of maintaining peace and strengthening stability  in Europe, increasing the openness of military activity, and  carrying out conversion of the military-industrial complex. An  important stage in the creation of a security system in Europe  will be the forthcoming regular CSCE summit in Budapest this  year.    The "Partnership for Peace" concept adopted by NATO in  Brussels was a major incentive to dialogue on these problems.  Displaying a responsible approach, our partners did not succumb  to the temptation of "quick-fix" solutions to security problems  and did not opt for the extension of NATO membership to the  East, which was fraught with the danger of provoking a new split  in Europe. Instead of this, emphasis was placed on developing  cooperation with all states on an equal basis. It is important  now that we not only do not lag behind other countries, but move  more quickly than they on the road of establishing genuine  partnership, above all in the military area. Otherwise the  isolation of Russia, which we managed to avoid on the political  level, could occur on the practical level.    At the same time Russian diplomacy is not limited to just  the  partnership for peace option. We are promoting wider and more  far reaching initiatives for the formation of the new Europe,  including the extension of the NACC to include the neutral  states of Europe, and also in the area of offering Central  European countries interlocking security guarantees from Russia  and several of our West European partners.    In the sphere of bilateral relations with the leading West  European states we will continue top-level dialogue with the  FRG, France, Britain, and Spain. We hope in the near future to  complete talks with the European Union on an agreement on  partnership and cooperation.    Russia will continue to develop relations with the countries  of Central and East Europe on a new basis. We start from the  premise that the common interests of our countries as regards  democratic reforms, transition to effective market economies,  and the preservation of traditional ties between our peoples  significantly outweigh old grievances and suspicions. In recent  years the treaty-legal basis of our relations with the majority  of Central and East European countries has been radically  renewed. We expect to complete this process by drafting  political treaties with Romania and Albania. Russia will  continue to participate actively in the search for a settlement  to the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. To the extent that  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia complies with UN demands, we will  seek to have the sanctions against this country rescinded and to  restore its status in the United Nations and other international  organizations.    The visits to Moscow of U.S. President B. Clinton and Vice  President A. Gore consolidated the aim of moving toward mature  partnership in Russian-U.S. relations. Now the task is to  exploit to the full the newly opened opportunities for  cooperation in the political, economic, scientific and  technical, and other spheres.    An important step toward lifting restrictions on our  foreign economic relations will be the forthcoming abolition of  COCOM [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls]  in spring 1994. The creation of new international arrangements  for monitoring trading in arms and "dual" technologies  presupposes the participation of Russia -- a major producer of  arms and military "know-how."    New steps will be made to bring Russia closer to the G-7.  Following the Tokyo meeting between B.N. Yeltsin and the G-7  leaders our dialogue with the G-7 has acquired a regular,  working character. A G-7 mission in Moscow has been set up, and  our diplomats and financiers participate in meetings with its  experts. At the forthcoming G-7 summit in Naples Russia intends  to propose beginning the practical transformation of this  formation into a G-8, starting with the political sphere.    An important foreign policy task is the use in Russia's  interests of its unique position as a Eurasian power. In recent  years we have managed to a significant degree to pave the way to  large-scale cooperation with leading Asian states -- India,  China, Japan -- and also to begin developing relations with new  partners (South Korea and the countries of ASEAN and the Persian  Gulf). Now these new opportunites in the sphere of economic and  scientific and technical cooperation must be exploited. The  strategic guideline in the Asia-Pacific region is the effective  incorporation of he regions of Siberia and the Far East in  international cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.    The promotion of our interests in the southern direction is  linked above all with ensuring stability there and removing  hotbeds of tension. We will actively pursue the course of  neutralizing threats to the security of Russia and the  Commonwealth countries and opposing religious extremism and  aggressive nationalism.    Russia is deeply committed to the settlement of the Near  East  problem. Our efforts will center on continuing, in close  collaboration with the United States, Russia's role as a  cosponsor of the peace process and on helping to promote the  realization of the aspirations of the Palestinian people. We  will seek to develop broad economic cooperation with countries  of the Arab world with the aim of involving their financial  resources in the economic modernization of Russia and  consolidating its positions on world markets, including the arms  market.    Our relations with the countries of Latin America, with many  of whom we have interesting experience in the economic,  technological, and other spheres, will be stepped up.    Continuing our course toward developing cooperation with the  countries of Africa, Russia will maintain its active involvement  in the settlement processes under UN auspices in Somalia,  Angola, and Mozambique.    In the sphere of multilateral diplomacy we will  energetically  promote the strengthening of the United Nations. We will seek a  model for reforming this organization -- including its Security  Council -- which leads to the increase of the effectiveness of  the United Nations as the leading institution of international  cooperation. Our priorities are to involve the United Nations  in actively supporting Russia's peace-making activity and  protecting human and national minority rights, and also the  rights of the victims of armed conflicts.    The "domestic" agenda of Russian diplomats' work also  promises to be extensive. One important avenue of this work is  to offer support to Russian regions entering into direct  international relations. In recent times, with Russia's active  cooperation, a whole series of cooperation structures have been  set up in the region of the Baltic, the Black Sea, and the  Barents Sea/Euroarctic region. Now the most difficult task  remains -- to ensure that the mechanisms of cooperation that  have been set up genuinely start to work for the specific  socioeconomic needs of wide areas of Russia. This has special  significance for our Northwest region, which until recently was  completely isolated from the outside world by a veil of secrecy.  Now the state must repay its debt to the Russian North. The  Ministry of Foreign Affairs intends to continue to actively help  Murmansk and Arkhangelsk Oblasts and Karelia to establish direct  links with business partners in Scandinavia and West Europe.    In implementing its foreign policy the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs counts on constructive collaboration with the new  Russian parliament. We expect the Federal Assembly to play an  active part in the formation of a legislative basis for Russia's  foreign policy activity.</p>

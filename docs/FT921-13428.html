			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: BAe falls after twin setback BRITISH Aerospace (BAe) fell heavily early in the session on weekend press reports, later confirmed by the company, that the finance director was to resign and that BAe faced an Pounds 80m claim from Asda over an agreement concerning Burwood House, a 50 per cent jointly owned property operation. BAe said it expected to reach an agreement over the claim very soon and had made provisions for the losses. Mr Sandy Morris of County NatWest said: 'Problems on the property side are not a surprise, but it is disappointing that further problems have emerged.' The market took the view that the finance director's departure was further fall-out from last year's Pounds 432m disastrous rights issue at the company. An analyst commented: 'The market has been demanding that further heads must roll and they have now got one.' Mr Chris Avery at Smith New Court simply called today's news 'another couple of disappointments for this accident-prone company'. Bargain hunters, however, ensured that the shares recovered from the day's worst, eventually ending 12 off at 302p on turnover of 4.6m. At their worst the stock touched 288p. Asda had an unexceptional day. The stock firmed a penny to 36 1/2 p on volume of 12m. British Gas busy Shares in British Gas improved 3 to 246p on heavy turnover of 7m, with much of the buying coming from Smith New Court. There was a story that Gas may be considering the spin-off of a large part of its industrial gas marketing operation in a move that would allow it to meet the gas regulator's market objectives without undue damage to shareholder value. Mr Steve Turner, energy specialist at Smith, said that after the creation of such independent companies they would be given to Gas's existing holders, perhaps on a one-for-one basis, or alternatively floated on the stock market. Vodafone active A big placing of Vodafone shares, said to have been carried out by James Capel, left the stock as the most heavily traded in the market. The Seaq ticker revealed a block of 4.9m shares dealt at 352p and another similar sized block traded at 355p. The deals, carried out at substantial discounts to the ruling market price, left Vodafone 8 lower at 363p. Volume was a heavy 12m. The placing underlines a cautious tone on the shares, which had brightened in the last quarter of 1991 as signs emerged that the cellular market was picking up. However, the recovery has failed to materialise and analysts have again been bearish. This month both BZW and Phillips &amp; Drew have turned cautious on the shares. Kingfisher falters Government statistics showing poor retail sales for December, as well as a forecast cut by one securities house, affected Kingfisher, which fell 10 before rallying with the market to close a net 3 off at 494p in a depressed stores sector. County Natwest lowered its profits prediction for 1991 to Pounds 207.3m from Pounds 214m, mainly in reaction to competitive pressures in the do-it-yourself market and its Comet electrical goods chain. The whole sector was weak after the government announced that UK retail sales fell a provisional seasonally-adjusted 1 per cent in December, giving a year-on-year decline of 0.4 per cent. Recent Footsie constituent WH Smith 'A' lost 12 to 461p ahead of interim results on January 29, while Marks and Spencer declined 6 to 296p. Publisher Reed International was weak at the expense of Pearson after securities house SG Warburg published a hefty re-evaluation of the media sector yesterday. Reed receded 5 to 523p while Pearson improved 10 to 765p. The 20-page document will be the basis of a series of meetings with institutional clients over the coming weeks. Warburg reduced its 1992 forecast for Reed by Pounds 10m to Pounds 220m and that for next year by Pounds 15m to Pounds 258m on consideration of currency factors. It argues that although Reed's outperformance was justified, there is a case for 'near-term profit-taking'. On the other hand, it reasons that: 'The strength of Pearson's balance sheet will continue to underpin the price (of the shares).' Pharmaceuticals company Glaxo rose 26 to 864p on a reassessment of the sector following heavy selling last week and good news on one of its products. The company reported that it had been granted a licence to market its Serevent anti-asthma drug in Italy. There was a further announcement that the company had sold 30 of its pharmaceuticals brands to drugs company Medeva, which moved up 12 to 228p on the news. Fisons rallied 19 to 353p, with the shares receiving added encouragement ahead of its research and development meeting. Securities houses SG Warburg and Kleinwort Benson were also said to be discussing the company with clients. Warburg refused to comment but Mr Ian White of Kleinwort said he had been repeating his recent buy stance on the stock. Wellcome, up 16 at 1050p, was helped by a forecast upgrade from Smith New Court, which has raised its estimate for the year ending in August by Pounds 10m to Pounds 500m. A sharp rise in Abbey National last week was reversed after securities house UBS Phillips &amp; Drew cut its forecast for the bank's profits. The shares lost 8 1/2 to 290p. UBS reduced its 1992 figure by Pounds 60m to Pounds 635m and its dividend forecast to 11.15p from 11.75p. It changed its stance from hold to trading sell. The house believes the recent cut in the mortgage rate will squeeze margins and the bank will suffer more than previously thought from high mortgage arrears. UBS was an aggressive seller of Abbey and a buyer of TSB following well-received results last week. TSB gained 3 to 132 1/2 p. Conglomerate Lonrho regained lost ground on hopes that the group will hold its annual dividend at 16p in spite of an expected drop in profits when it announces full-year results on Thursday. The shares rose 14 to 164p with 7.6m traded. James Wilkes jumped 30 to 189p after the company confirmed market speculation that it had received a bid approach. Rank Organisation moved ahead 19 to 635p as unconfirmed reports said that the leisure group had sold its Royal Garden Hotel for between Pounds 60m to Pounds 70m. Overseas investors, particularly Japanese, were sellers of electricity issues. National Power lost 2 1/2 to 138 1/2 p but PowerGen ended 2 firmer at 149p following brisk turnover of 9.2m and 7.6m shares respectively. Activity in the building and construction sector was again dominated by the Steetley bid for Redland, with the former losing gains made on Friday. Positive sentiment had been prompted by market talk of other parties entering the fray, with ECC interest in Steetley favourite. However, a weekend statement by ECC denying the speculation left Steetley 4 cheaper at 377p. Redland gained 4 to 477p, while ECC put on 9 to 494p. Buy notes from BZW, among others, helped Blue Circle add 9 at 259p. Profit-taking in Meyer International left the builders supplier down 12 at 411p. From today, the Financial Times will publish the gross dividend yield on the FT-SE 100 index. It will appear each day in the panel at the bottom of the left-hand columns of the front page. The yield on the FT Ordinary index will continue to appear on this page as before. The yield calculation is the same as that used in the FT-Actuaries All-Share index. It is obtained by multiplying total gross dividends payable of the index constitutents by their number of shares in issue, and dividing the result by the total market capitalisation of the companies in the index. The resulting figure is multiplied by 100 to give a percentage rate. 'Running gross dividends' are used: last final dividend plus latest interim dividend, or vice versa, with the tax credit added. The approach differs from that used in the London Share Service pages, where the yield is based on the last annual gross dividend. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (59).

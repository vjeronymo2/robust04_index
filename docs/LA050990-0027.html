			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: RAMONA  </P> <P> Repairs to the major pipeline that supplies imported water to the North County  community of Ramona were progressing on schedule Tuesday, said Becky Coates,  spokeswoman for the Ramona Municipal Water District.  </P> <P> About 33,000 customers in the Ramona area have been ordered to maintain strict  rationing controls during the emergency, which began Sunday night when the  pipeline broke under built-up pressure.  </P> <P> Coates said the work should be completed by tonight after a replacement sleeve  arrives from an out-of-state supplier.  </P> <P> Until then, no outside water use is allowed by residents and other water uses  are restricted.  </P> <P> With cutoff of imported water, the community must depend on a  5-million-gallon-a-day supply from Sutherland Reservoir.  </P></p>

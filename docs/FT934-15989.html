			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Ferranti warns of higher losses FIRST-HALF losses at Ferranti International, the struggling electronics group, are likely to be higher than in the corresponding period last year, Mr Eugene Anderson, chairman, warned yesterday. Mr Anderson told shareholders attending an extraordinary meeting, called under Companies Act requirements because its net assets had fallen to less than half its Pounds 96.8m share capital, that it was too soon to report on the performance for the half year to September 30. However, he added, 'we will incur another loss during the period which will almost certainly be larger than the comparable loss last year'. In the 1992 period Ferranti, which came close to collapse following the 1989 discovery of huge fraud in International Signal and Control, its US subsidiary, managed to reduce its interim pre-tax losses to Pounds 10.9m. Mr Anderson, who was brought in to try and turn Ferranti around following the ISC fraud, told shareholders that despite the technical requirement to call the meeting, the board recommended that no action should be taken to implement a reduction in capital at this time. Instead, he said the company would continue to focus on its priorities of strengthening the balance sheet by equity injection or through strategic partnership while seeking to win new orders. 'Liquidity continues to be painfully tight, making supplier relationships more difficult', Mr Anderson said. He added that 'to alleviate this problem we have continued to seek an equity injection or a strategic partnership'. Although the chairman said the group had continued to be successful in winning new orders and ended August with an order book of Pounds 178m and outstanding bids for Pounds 740m of new business, he said the group was still waiting for confirmation of several large orders. The shareholders, who met in London, overwhelmingly supported the proposal, although some were critical of the management's performance.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / When neighbours make good returns: The yen's rise is encouraging a strategic shift by Japanese industry into other Asian markets One of the most important - and least noticed - consequences of the yen's recent rise has been to drive Japan into a fresh trade and investment assault on its Asian neighbours. Its economic advance into Asia, which began with the first round of yen appreciation in the late 1980s, is entering a new phase. The US and Europe stand helpless, watching their share of Japanese investment decline and Japan's economic dominance of Asia increase. Asia overtook the US as Japan's largest export destination in 1991 and last year Japan's trade surplus with the region surpassed its surplus with the US for the first time. Ten years ago, Japan exported a third more to the US than to Asia; now the balance is the other way. Japanese direct investment in the rest of Asia has followed a similar pattern, a short way behind export growth. Its investments there rose more than threefold from Dollars 2.3bn in 1986 to Dollars 7.3bn in 1993, roughly one-fifth of Japanese investment worldwide. Japanese investment in Asia will nearly double, as a share of overall foreign investment, to 37.5 per cent this year, according to a recent survey by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. At this rate, Asia will by the end of the decade overtake the US as the largest recipient of Japanese direct investment, believes Mr Chi-hung Kwan, senior manager at Nomura Research Institute (NRI). One of the latest leading Japanese companies to bolster its presence in the region is Toshiba, the electronic machinery maker, which recently asked four of its domestic telecommunications equipment component suppliers to decamp from Japan to its plant in Huanzhou, an industrial port in eastern China. This is the first time it has asked its suppliers to move wholesale into Asia, a change in strategy motivated by its managers' realisation that Japan's economic fortunes are becoming increasingly linked with those of its quickly industrialising neighbours. Until recently, the group used its 14 plants there as satellites, explains Mr Kazuo Ishiguro, the group's Asian manager. Their job was to assemble Japanese-made components cheaply and re-export them to Japan, the US and Europe. Like many Japanese companies, Toshiba responded to the yen's sharp rise in value after the 1985 Plaza accord, which was aimed at curbing the value of the dollar, by shifting the lowest technology parts of its production outside Japan. Now, Toshiba also assumes that Asia will be its fastest-growing market for at least the next decade, not merely the pool of cheap production it was in the 1980s, says Mr Ishiguro. He predicts Huanzhou-type operations will be the new pattern for Toshiba's investment in the region. A growing number of Japanese companies can be expected to follow Toshiba's example and add component suppliers to their basic assembly plants in the region, believes Mr Yoshio Sakakibara, Asian director of the Japan External Trade Organisation (Jetro). 'Across Asia, Japanese companies are looking to increase their local content ratios, because the size of the market is increasing,' he says. There is a second, more basic factor. Many seek to step up local content to avoid heavy import duties on part-assembled products. This was, incidentally, one reason for the wave of Japanese investment in Europe a decade ago. Japan's industrial advance into east Asia has been led by sectors in which assembly forms a high share of costs, such as consumer electronics - as a result of which Japan last year became a net importer of colour televisions for the first time - home appliances and cars. Automotive component suppliers have yet to join the exodus on the same scale. Notable examples include consumer electronic giants Matsushita and Sharp in Malaysia, which have become so deeply embedded in the local economy that their combined local sales account for 6 per cent of the country's gross domestic product, according to Jetro. Toyota, Hitachi and Sony have all in recent months opened new plants or announced expansion plans in Thailand, to sell to the local market. Japanese banks have followed their industrial customers so that the rest of Asia last year overtook Europe to become the second-most important foreign destination of Japanese banks' foreign loans after the US. So far, Japanese companies have reaped rich rewards from their Asian onslaught, all the more welcome when their domestic market has been struggling through the longest recession in postwar years. According to the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), the operating profits of manufacturers' Asian offshoots, as a percentage of turnover, averaged 4.8 per cent in 1991, well above the 0.9 per cent average for overseas subsidiaries. Japan's economic influence in the rest of Asia has grown so strong that its neighbours are now under pressure to peg their currencies to the yen, rather than the dollar - the first step towards the formation of a yen bloc, argues the NRI's Mr Kwan. A yen bloc in Asia might seem, to many, a distant prospect, given that the region's political and economic differences are even greater than between Europe Union countries, which are struggling to establish a currency bloc. Yet even without a yen bloc, Japan's tilt towards Asia will help give the region a 'force, coherence and structure that will change - and profoundly - not only the global balance of economic, industrial and financial power, but also the international balance of political power,' predicts Mr Kenneth Curtis, senior economist at Deutsche Bank Capital Markets Asia. Japan's economic advance on Asia does, however, face barriers. These include corporate Japan's understandable caution, regional political instability - illustrated by the worries over North Korea's even less predictable new leadership - and the tentativeness of Tokyo's attempts to deepen diplomatic relations in the rest of Asia. Mr Susumu Taketomi, the IBJ's chief economist, believes the growth rate of Japan's Asian investments will be constrained by companies' unwillingness to break the social taboo against making redundancies at home. There will be, he predicts, a reorganisation of Japanese investments within the region, away from relatively high-cost areas such as Hong Kong into cheap ones such as southern China. Japan's trade surplus with the rest of Asia will continue to rise, but Mr Taketomi believes the overall volume of trade will grow fast enough to defuse serious political problems of the kind that bedevil Japan over its surplus with the US. 'This surplus is healthy for Asian countries. They will probably succeed in upgrading their industrial structure so that they will show a surplus at the end of the century. Japan was in a similar situation in the 1960s,' he says. Forty years later, Japan will be the prime candidate to absorb the coming explosion in Asian exports, he predicts. The government has played a cautious role in supporting Japan's economic advance into Asia by trying to deepen diplomatic relations with the region - partly in response to the weakening in Tokyo's relations with Washington brought by the end of the cold war. Until recently, Japan's Asian strategy was one-dimensional. It consisted of disbursing 60 per cent of its annual overseas aid budget - the world's largest - to the region, a hangover from postwar reparations. But Japan's support for the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum (Apec), set up five years ago partly on a blueprint drawn up by Tokyo's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, has enabled it to make a slightly wider diplomatic contribution. Tokyo will host the third summit of Apec leaders next year, and is backing the Asean Regional Forum - a body formed to discuss security in the region. However, Japan still has some way to go to win its neighbours' complete trust. A claim made in May by a former justice minister that the 1937 massacre of Nanking, an infamous Japanese wartime atrocity, never happened, created serious diplomatic damage, undermining especially South Korean government efforts to persuade other Asian countries of Japanese credibility. It also sent shivers of alarm through Japanese company subsidiaries across Asia, according to some of their Tokyo-based colleagues. None of them reported a significant drop in sales as a result, but the incident showed that Japan's inexorable economic advance into Asia will not always be smooth.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Japan's direct investment overseas  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Financial years (% of total)                           1989     1990     1991     1992     1993                                                             1st half  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Asian NIEs:                7.3      5.9      5.3      5.6      7.8   South Korea              0.9      0.5      0.6      0.7      1.0   Taiwan                   0.7      0.8      1.0      0.9      0.8   Hong Kong                2.8      3.1      2.2      2.2      3.9   Singapore                2.8      1.5      1.5      2.0      2.1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Asean 4:                   4.1      5.7      7.4      9.4      6.3   Indonesia                0.9      1.9      2.9      4.9      2.8   Malaysia                 1.0      1.3      2.1      2.1      1.4   Philippines              0.3      0.5      0.5      0.5      0.3   Thailand                 1.9      2.0      1.9      1.9      1.7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- China                      0.6      0.6      1.4      3.1      4.4 US                        48.2     45.9     43.3     40.5     40.9  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Figures do not include re-investment Source: Nomura Research Institute  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

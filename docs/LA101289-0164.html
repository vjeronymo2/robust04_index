			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARTIER TO OFFER CIGARETTE WORTHY OF RODEO DRIVE  </P> <P> Cartier has plans for a diamond in the puff.  </P> <P> A pricey cigarette bearing the Cartier name and logo -- once reserved for the  likes of fine jewelry -- makes its American debut in the Los Angeles area this  week. The cigarette already is sold in Europe. If enough Los Angeles area  smokers buy it, Cartier cigarettes will eventually be sold in other U.S.  cities.  </P> <P> The brand, which will come in specially designed packs with Cartier's familiar  "double C" logo, will be made in the United States by Philip Morris under a  licensing agreement with the French company, House of Cartier. Executives say  the brand will cost about twice the price of conventional cigarettes -- more  than $3 per pack.  </P> <P> "It's not for everyone," said Ellen Merlo, vice president of marketing services  for Philip Morris U.S.A. Indeed, Cartier won't even be sold at the corner  drugstore.  </P> <P> The company says Cartier cigarettes will be sold mostly in luxury hotels, fine  restaurants and at tobacco specialty stores. It will also be delivered -- by  the carton -- to smokers with major credit cards who want the swanky cigarettes  sent to their homes.  </P> <P> Of course, not everyone plans on placing an order. "Smoking is no longer seen  as sophisticated in America," said John F. Banzhaf III, executive director of  the Washington-based anti-smoking lobby, Action on Smoking and Health. "Cartier  must think cigarette smokers are pretty stupid," he said. "What are Cartier  smokers going to get -- cancer at twice the price?'  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLDEN SEEKS REGISTRATION OF ROLEX WATCHES  </P> <P> In an attempt to halt a rash of violent Rolex watch thefts, Los Angeles City  Councilman Nate Holden on Thursday said he will introduce an ordinance  requiring buyers of the luxury timepieces to register the serial number with  police.  </P> <P> Holden said registration would make it difficult for crooks to sell purloined  watches.  </P> <P> The proposed ordinance also would place a "five-day waiting period" on the sale  of any second-hand Rolex and would require pawnshop operators to check the  serial numbers of Rolexes with the Police Department.  </P> <P> "If a robber is made aware that he can no longer steal . . . a Rolex watch for  profit, then there will be no incentive to do so," said Holden in a City Hall  news conference.  </P> <P> Rolex watches, which sell for a few thousand dollars to more than $100,000,  have increasingly become a target for crime in recent months, culminating in  August when the Los Angeles Police Department reported that such thefts  occurred at the rate of one a day. Several Southland Rolex owners have been  killed in theft attempts.  </P> <P> Despite the grim trend, police and jewelers who specialize in the expensive  watches were lukewarm to Holden's proposal. "We applaud his effort to further  get a handle on this," said Lt. Fred Nixon, a spokesman for the LAPD. "But we  have some doubt about the value of such a system."  </P> <P> Nixon said most owners of such expensive watches already register them with  insurance companies, and the LAPD's pawnshop detail checks serial-numbered  items against theft reports.  </P> <P> Even Holden acknowledged another problem with the proposal: thieves could  simply sell their ill-gotten wares in a neighboring city to avoid the Los  Angeles law altogether.  </P> <P> Philip Stone, chief of security for the Rolex Authorized Service Center in Los  Angeles, said the Holden proposal was ludicrous. It would be impossible to  check with the LAPD every time a watch comes in for repair, he said, adding  that most Rolex service centers already work closely with law enforcement  agencies to identify stolen watches.  </P> <P> Another problem with the proposal, Stone said, is that many Rolex owners would  be apprehensive to add their names and addresses to any list of valuable goods.  "How would you know whose hands such a list could fall into," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Banco Wiese shares begin NYSE trading Shares in Banco Wiese, the first Peruvian company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, were expected to open at about Dollars 15 a share today. The listing is under the ADR Level 3 mechanism, and should allow Banco Wiese to raise between Dollars 40m and Dollars 50m. This represents about 10 per cent of the bank's total value. Three-quarters of the new issue has been offered in the US, the remainder in Europe and Peru. Banco Wiese is Peru's second-largest private bank, after Banco de Credito but ahead of the state-owned Continental which is scheduled for privatisation early next year. It now accounts for some 21 per cent of all deposits in the Peruvian system, compared with 5.5 per cent in 1988, and is among the more liquid shares traded on Lima's small but active bourse. The bank's offering is being closely followed in Lima. Several other companies are contemplating ADR issues in the near future, including Pantel, the fast-growing telecommunications group, and CPT, Lima's telephone company, in which Telefonica International recently acquired a controlling stake.</p>

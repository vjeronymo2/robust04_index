			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> JUILLIARD BEGINS BEETHOVEN CYCLE  </P> <P> The Juilliard String Quartet, which appeared at Ambassador Auditorium on  Thursday for the first of five season-spanning concerts devoted to the complete  quartets of Beethoven, has, in various personnel configurations, been putting  on this show for four decades.  </P> <P> So the critical pulse hardly races in anticipation of yet another Juilliard go  at the canonic 17. But it didn't take long before Beethoven and the best  Juilliard configuration ever -- founding first violinist Robert Mann and his  younger colleagues, second violinist Joel Smirnoff, violist Samuel Rhodes and  cellist Joel Krosnick -- made us willing captives.  </P> <P> To open, there was the quartet in F, Opus 18, No. 1. Its bluff joviality  embraces a slow movement as intensely emotional as anything Beethoven ever  created, although its formal clarity would give way to the less direct methods  employed in the later works.  </P> <P> The creative perspiration of self-consciously deep works of Beethoven's last  period -- such as the Quartet in A minor, Opus 132 -- was minimized by playing  of uncommon sweetness and lightness of tone.  </P> <P> Finally, the performers backtracked to the composer's middle period with the  grandly self-assured, vivacious "Razumovsky" Quartet in C, Opus 59, No. 3.  </P> <P> If they lost some of their concentration here -- the Minuet tended to wander --  the precipitous finale offered that combination of ardor, technical aplomb and  linear clarity that is the essence and particular joy of Juilliard.

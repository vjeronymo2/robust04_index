			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / International Company News: SA Brewing in US expansion SA BREWING Holdings, the diversified Adelaide-based brewing and manufacturing group, yesterday said it had more than doubled its share of the US water heater market through the USDollars 31.65m acquisition of Mor-Flo Industries. SA Brewing said the acquisition would give it 30 per cent of the US market for mains pressure water heaters, which accounts for around 7.6m units a year. The group entered the US water heaters market in 1989 thorough the purchase of Bradford-White Corporation of Michigan, which claimed around 12 per cent of the market. Mr Ross Wilson, SA Brewing managing director, said the acquisition of Mor-Flo, which has annual sales of around USDollars 200m, was in line with the group's long-term strategy of increasing its US presence. Mr Wilson said SA Brewing would rationalise the manufacturing operations of Mor-Flo and Bradford-White. The deal, which is subject to US regulatory approval, is expected to be concluded in August.</p>

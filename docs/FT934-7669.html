			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (11): Ambitious targets - Development zones THE AMBITIONS of Chinese provincial governments are on display in their development zones. In Yantai, on the Shandong coast, a gaudy banner proclaims that the 'investor is god,' and in Dalian, in the north, a billboard sets the goal of 'building a world class yacht club.' Development zones are the greenfield sites in which local officials have let their imaginations flourish. State-run banks have built lavish buildings, developers want a 'millionaire's row' of luxury villas, and vacant stretches of land are enthusiastically described as a Chinese silicon valley. Beijing disapproves of the provincial passion for development zones, and closed 1,000 of 1,200 opened in eastern China. Village administrations had followed the trend started in 1984 by clearing farmland for their own zone, which stirred old fears about wasting scarce financial resources and the disappearance of agricultural land. Mr Gu Hong, deputy director of the Suzhou National New and High-Technology Industrial Zone, emphasised that his zone is 'approved by the State Council' the Chinese government. On the morning of the Financial Times tour, the toilets at the zone's offices were perfumed and a meeting room prepared for a visit by Mr Wang Bingqian, the former finance minister and state councillor. 'There are 52 development zones approved by the State Council, and that means that the government thinks these areas have conditions suitable for a zone,' says Mr Gu. 'The benefit of approval is that the state will provide funds for investment and encourage large enterprises to come here. It also means that we have a preferential tax policy.' The government of Suzhou, traditionally known for its silk, ornate gardens and canals, describes the zone, approved last year, as the third stage of the city's development, and has built an elaborate model capturing the vision of universities alongside high-tech factories in tree-lined streets. Mr Gu says that the 16sq km of the zone has agreements for 130 ventures involving Dollars 1.2bn in investment, 68 per cent of which is foreign. The zones has attracted Philips, which has a television project, Upjohn, the US pharmaceutical company, and Acer, the Taiwanese electronics company. At the Yantai Economic and Technical Development Zone, the boast is that the local bureaucracy will process a joint venture application within an hour, 'even if the forms are incomplete.' Given Chinese officials' love of finding fault with documents, the boast is even more remarkable than the zone's new karaoke bar, opened in an old Air China jet parked beside the beach. Mr Tian Fengcheng, vice director of the Yantai zone, said contracted investment in the zone has risen from Dollars 360m in 1991, when much of the infrastructure was in place, to Dollars 700m last year and another Dollars 700m in the first nine months of this year. Around 35 per cent of the money is from non-Chinese companies, but the zone is falling behind the Dalian zone, to the north, which been particularly successful in luring Japanese investment. 'We find it easier to deal with US and European companies than Japanese companies,' says Mr Tian. 'Our Japanese friends are becoming more interested in Yantai, but they want very big profits and they pay a lot more attention to details.' In Dalian, 20 Japanese companies, with the assistance of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti), have set up their own development area.</p>

			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> VIKINGS' BAKER FINED $10,000 FOR LATE TACKLE  </P> <P> Minnesota Vikings defensive end Al Baker said he will appeal a $10,000 fine by  the National Football League for a late hit on Chicago quarterback Mike Tomczak  in the last game of the regular season.  </P> <P> Baker said Monday that he's asked for a hearing before NFL Commissioner Pete  Rozelle.  </P> <P> "I'm really shocked and I'm pretty disappointed in the way it was handled  because it wasn't intentional," said Baker, who has lost $30,000 in fines and  salary this season. "If he (Rozelle) reviewed the film, he could see it wasn't  flagrant. Maybe he was trying to make an example out of me. And I frown on  that."  </P> <P> Earlier, Rozelle suspended Baker for one game without pay for punching  Philadelphia Eagles tackle Ron Heller in the eye during a game Sept. 25. That  suspension cost Baker a week's pay, or about $20,000.  </P></p>

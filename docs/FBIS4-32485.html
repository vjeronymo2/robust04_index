			<p>BFN     [Text] A press communique faxed to our editorial office by  the Romanian Presidency reads as follows:    This morning Romanian President Ion Iliescu received a  delegation of the leadership of the Democratic Agrarian Party of  Romania [PDAR]. The goal of the meeting was to facilitate  direct contacts, during which the president can be briefed about  various problems particularly in the economic area and  especially those prevailing in agriculture. This political  group has also made public those problems in a recent letter to  the president and other forums of state power.    On this occasion, the sides proceeded to a broad exchange of  views on the problems that Romania is currently facing,  concludes the press statement received from the Presidency.    After the meeting Iliescu held at Cotroceni Palace with the  PDAR delegation, Victor Surdu, the PDAR president announced in a  press statement that during the meeting the party  representatives expressed the discontent of the Agrarians with  the lack of receptiveness and effectiveness with which the  executive acted to solve problems that were repeatedly brought  to its attention by the PDAR and asked the head of state to act  more firmly, quote, to ensure the appropriate moral and  professional performance of the current government team,  unquote. Surdu added that the PDAR will continue to get  involved in the political life of the country as an independent  and decent opposition party.    To conclude, the leader of the Agrarians affirmed, quote, I  believe that the dialogue that we held with the country's  president, although characterized by a tense atmosphere and the  presence of certain disagreements regarding the way in which  certain economic and social problems should be approached, was  still a useful dialogue.

After the Russian initiative averted air strikes on  Sarajevo,  "statements came from NATO and several high-ranking diplomatic  circles which contain barely hidden disappointment that NATO had  not used its assault airforce. The idea is being imposed that  the NATO ultimatum should be used to 'ensure order' in other  places of the conflict. Moreover, attempts are made to shade  the Russian role in initiating a diplomatic solution of the  conflict. Special bewilderment is caused by attempts to doubt  the capability of the Russian peace-keeping force to  professionally and impartially fulfill its duty", Vyacheslav  Kostikov said in a statement on Wednesday [23 February].    "There is an impression that NATO, despite peace-making  rhetorics, is still imprisoned by the ideology of the Cold War.  Psychologically one can understand that it is difficult for NATO  to adapt to a sharp change in political realities caused by the  birth of a democratic Russia. However, the price in human  lives, the risk which, as it turned out, the NATO command is  ready to take to support its status cannot but cause concern",  the spokesman said.    The Russian president is sure that Russia should and will  participate in solving all major international problems,  according to Kostikov who added that Russia will not allow any  discrimination regarding itself. "However, the new Russia is not  going to participate in any ritual sacrifices", he stressed.    "Russia rejects the language of military ultimatums and  welcomes the language of diplomacy. A return to the psychology  of the Cold War, heightening mistrust, a new wave of spy mania  would contradict the ideas of international partnership for  peace", Kostikov said.    The Russian president is convinced that "the arguments of  peace in Europe are weightier than the arguments of war and  invites leaders of Europe and the United States to draw a line  under the Bosnian conflict at a table of negotiations", he  stressed.</p>

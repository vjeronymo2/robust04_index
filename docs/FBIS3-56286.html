Clinton, having met together in Moscow from  January 12- 15, 1994, reaffirmed the fundamental importance of  Russian-U.S. cooperation based upon the Charter of  Russian-American Partnership and Friendship, the Vancouver  Declaration, and existing treaties and agreements. They noted  with satisfaction that the relationship between Russia and the  United States has entered a new stage of mature strategic  partnership based on equality, mutual advantage, and recognition  of each other's national interests. From this perspective, they  reviewed the full range of bilateral and international issues.    The two presidents had an extensive discussion of security  issues, including arms reduction and non-proliferation regimes.  They agreed upon the need to strengthen those regimes and to  create, together with other interested states, a new mechanism  to enhance transparency and responsibility in the transfer of  conventional arms and sensitive dual use technologies. They  also strongly supported completion of negotiations on a  comprehensive test ban at the earliest possible time. The two  presidents reiterated their support for a cutoff of production  of fissile materials for weapons and considered new measures to  strengthen strategic stability.    Based on ongoing discussions of strategic disengagement  measures between the Ministries of Defense of the two countries,  the presidents announced that they would direct the detargeting  of strategic nuclear missiles under their respective commands so  that by not later than May 30, 1994 those missiles will not be  targeted. Thus, for the first time in nearly half a century --  virtually since the dawn of the nuclear age -- Russia and United  States will not operate nuclear forces, day-to-day, in a manner  that presumes they are adversaries.    Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton expressed  satisfaction with the accelerating development of a wide range  of economic, scientific and technological relationships between  Russia and the United States. They also reaffirmed their strong  support for the rapid growth of bilateral trade and investment  as a special priority. In their view, the Gore-Chernomyrdin  Commission has become a dynamic and effective mechanism for  coordination and expansion of Russian-U.S. cooperation. A key  expression of this relationship is the Russian-U.S. joint  cooperation in space, especially their partnership, with other  interested parties, in the construction of a space station.    The two presidents reaffirmed their readiness to move  forward  on the path of openness and mutual trust in Russian-U.S.  relations and to create favorable conditions for the  comprehensive development of political, commercial, humanitarian  and people-to-people contacts between the two countries. In  this connection, a mutual interest in enlarging consular  presence on each other's territory was expressed. In particular,  the American side intends to open a consulate general in  Yekaterinburg in February 1994.    With the approval by the U.S. Congress of NAFTA [North  American Free Trade Agreement] and the successful completion of  the Uruguay round of global trade negotiations, President  Yeltsin and President Clinton welcomed the accelerating progress  toward creation of an open and prosperous world economy and  trading system. President Yeltsin informed President Clinton of  recent steps among the member-states of the Commonwealth of  Independent States towards increased economic coordination and  cooperation. The two presidents agreed that such initiatives,  pursued in an open and voluntary manner consistent with GATT  rules and procedures, should be conducive to the rapid inclusion  of all the participating states into the global economy.    In this context, President Yeltsin and President Clinton  exchanged views on the economic strategies of their respective  governments. President Yeltsin described the economic situation  in Russia. He affirmed the irreversibility of Russia's  transition to a market economy and his intention to further  promote reforms and to address social needs associated with this  transition. President Clinton stressed his strong support for  Russian reform and suggested that social issues could be a new  and promising area for cooperation.    President Yeltsin and President Clinton noted with  satisfaction that the end of the Cold War has brought continuous  progress toward overcoming the division of the European  continent and opened the way for broad cooperation among  European states on a new agenda of urgent tasks, with priority  being given to preventive diplomacy, peacekeeping and protection  of human rights and the rights of national and other minorities.  In this connection, the two presidents welcomed the decisions  of the CSCE foreign ministers' meeting in Rome, which they  consider to be an important step in making the CSCE a key  mechanism of international cooperation in Europe.    Proceeding from the conviction that new divisions of Europe  must be avoided, President Yeltsin and President Clinton agreed  upon the need to create a new European security order that is  inclusive, non-discriminatory and focused on practical political  and security cooperation. The two presidents agreed that the  concept of the Partnership for Peace adopted at the Brussels  meeting of the NATO member states is an important element of an  emerging new European security architecture. President Yeltsin  informed President Clinton of Russia's intention to participate  actively in the partnership for peace and to conclude  substantive agreements opening the way for broad and intensive  cooperation between Russia and NATO as a partner. Taking into  account Russia's international role, President Clinton welcomed  the prospect of Russia's active participation in the Partnership  for Peace.    The two presidents condemned aggressive nationalism,  violations of human rights, and religious intolerance of any  kind, including anti-Semitism. They expressed serious concern  about the existence and potential for intensification of  conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and in a number of the new  independent states of the former Soviet Union. President  Yeltsin apprised President Clinton of the peacekeeping efforts  undertaken by Russia on the territory of the former USSR. The  two presidents are determined to intensify the coordination of  their efforts, within the framework of the United Nations and  the CSCE, to promote rapid and peaceful resolution of conflicts  on conditions that correspond to generally accepted standards of  international law, including respect for the independence,  sovereignty, and existing borders of the new independent states  of the former Soviet Union.    The two presidents reaffirmed the support of Russia and the  United States for the United Nations. They will act with other  countries to strengthen the potential of the UN to support and  establish peace and to prevent conflicts. The two sides will  work out practical activities among themselves and other  countries to improve preparation for participation in UN  peacekeeping operations. In connection with the upcoming 50th  anniversary of the UN, Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin  consider it important to convene at the appropriate time a  meeting of the heads of state and government of the members of  the UN Security Council for a review of the work established for  the UN at the January 1992 Security Council summit and an  examination of tasks for the future.    President Yeltsin and President Clinton are convinced that  the United States and Russia will continue to consolidate their  partnership and together promote global stability, peace, and  prosperity.

			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Bank governors back more ERM flexibility THE European exchange rate mechanism needs to be more flexible and central parities must be accompanied by credible national economic policies, according to a report by the committee of EC central bank governors on last autumn's exchange rate crisis. The central bankers' report criticises member states for failing to make timely currency realignments and calls for a regular 'candid and frank' dialogue on the sustainability of existing ERM parties. The committee also expresses sympathy for the much-criticised Bundesbank's policy of maintaining high interest rates in the aftermath of German unification: 'A tight monetary stance was the necessary response to counter price increases, leaving little scope for interest rate reductions.' A central theme in the report is that the European monetary system should not be managed as a de facto monetary union. This would be premature as the necessary degree of economic convergence has yet to be achieved between member states. The ERM remains the designated vehicle for European monetary union as set out in the Maastricht treaty; but the central bankers make clear in their analysis of the crisis that there is no substitute for credible national policies in support of price stability. 'Realignments of central rates remain an important feature of the system and provision must be made for timely realignments when parities have become unsustainable in the light of a country's macroeconomic performance and its current and future policies.' The central bankers concede that the assessment of ERM parities is an extremely difficult task. The report refers to 'broad agreement' in the committee in favour of tighter surveillance of exchange rate relationships, a kind of early warning system. The idea is to help to prod member states toward a consensus on the sustainability of central rates or the desirability of a timely realignment. 'The committee stands ready to play its role in this surveillance exercise and to devise procedures for communicating its view to ministers.' The bank governors come down decisively against automatic responses to market tensions, such as symmetrical action on the part of authorities of countries with weaker and stronger currencies. Though they do not rule out intervening on an ad-hoc basis, the governors draw a clear line. Support will be forthcoming provided it does not jeopardise the control over domestic monetary conditions in the country issuing the intervention currency and that it is consistent with the primary objective of achieving price stability in the Community. This appears to meet objections from the Bundesbank that its support interventions in favour of weaker currencies - particularly in favour of the British pound and the Italian lira last September - risked jeopardising control of its domestic money supply. The governors say the ERM crisis confirmed that interventions - even where they were before the currency hit its margins - have only a limited effect in containing instability and may even exacerbate it if prolonged. 'Timely increases in interest rates remain the most promising course to counter market pressure,' the report says. But it concedes that prolonged high interest rates may not be sustainable if member states are in recession. The report declares that making market operators aware of the risks and possible losses from speculation is critical to managing the ERM. One option could be to allow a currency to strengthen within its fluctuation band when market pressures ease; another option is to use an element of surprise when offsetting the liquidity impact of exchange rate intervention in the money markets. The committee expresses caution about any possible changes in the width of the fluctuation bands for the weaker and stronger currencies of 2 1/2 per cent and 6 per cent respectively. The committee notes that decisions on the band should be preceded by 'close consultation', taking account of the same factors as those considered when the sustainability of the parity grid is examined. Also, the central bankers note that recent large-scale interventions financed through the short-term financing facility - that is, unlimited intervention financed in Ecus when exchange rates are at their limits - resulted in 'substantial' losses for participating countries. Accordingly, the committee says it intends to study ways to change the present arrangement, taking account of the need to preserve an Ecu-based system. Lastly, the central bankers attack politicians (and occasionally the monetary committee) for making empty promises on currency parities. It voices 'strong doubts about the usefulness of collective public statements in support of the existing central parities if not backed by immediate action. Experience has shown that such statements may fail to have a positive impact on market expectations and could also be damaging to the credibility of the authorities. 'However, when combined with decisive and visible action, demonstrating the authorities' determination to defend central rates, statements may play a useful complementary role,' the report says.</p>

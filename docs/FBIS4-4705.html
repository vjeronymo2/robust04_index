			<p>BFN     [Text] President Suharto received a courtesy call from Kim  Chang-kyu, deputy foreign minister of North Korea at Bina Graha  Presidential Office in Jakarta this morning. Kim Chang-kyu was  accompanied by Nana Sutresna, chairman of the Nonaligned  Movement's [NAM] Steering Committee.    Following the meeting, Nana Suresna told newsmen that the  North Korean deputy foreign minister said his country is ready  to implement the agreement reached with the United States to  allow IAEA inspection of its nuclear facilities.    Nana Sutresna also quoted President Suharto as saying that  Indonesia, being the NAM chairman, feels responsible in seeing  that several accords reached at the 10th NAM summit in Jakarta  1992 are implemented.    According to President Suharto, Indonesia feels that it is a  good opportunity for developing countries to foster cordial  relations and cooperation, especially economically, for the  development of individual countries following the end of the  Cold War. Indonesia's initiative taken in its capacity as the  NAM chairman is aimed at creating stability in NAM member  countries so that they are capable of carrying out national  development.    Nana Sutrena said Indonesia is focusing its attention on  efforts to solve the North Korea's nuclear issue.    [Begin Sutresna recording] President Suharto has reiterated  that Indonesia, being the NAM chairman, has absolutely no  intention of intefering in North Korea's domestic affairs, that  is in connection with the nuclear issue. But, Indonesia is very  concerned over the development of this issue. It is hoped that  the issue will be immediately solved through a general consensus  so that stability in the Korean peninsula, as well as in  countries around the area, can be achieved. On the occasion,  President Suharto was conveyed an invitation from North Korean  President Kim Il-song to visit Pyongyang. President Suharto  said that he had always wished to visit Pyongyang but has not  been able to do so due to his busy schedule in Jakarta. He said  he will try to find an appropriate time to visit North Korea  after the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, APEC, meeting in  Jakarta. [end recording]    After handing President Kim Il-song's personal letter to  President Suharto, Kim Chang-kyu, who is also the special envoy  of the North Korean president, briefed newsmen on the various  developments in the Korean peninsula.</p>

However, none of the officials participating in the  negotiations makes a special secret of the purpose and tendency  of the talks. The delegations, headed by Kazakhstan's state  counsellor Tulegen Zhukeyev and Russian space agency general  director Yuriy Koptev, are forging rapprochement between the two  countries on the status of the ex-Soviet space port and the rent  Russia is asked to pay for its lease.    Progress is hampered by Kazakhstan's demand that Russia, the  legal successor to the former Soviet Union pay ecological  damages caused to the regions bordering on Baykonur throughout  the years of its operation.    If the negotiations end successfully, the status of Baykonur  will be put on the agenda of the upcoming meeting between  President Boris Yeltsin and President Nursultan Nazarbayev at  the end of March.    The two countries will then sign documents on the status and  use of Baykonur on a new basis.</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Multitone calls in with 36% advance Multitone Electronics, the paging systems and equipment maker, achieved a 36 per cent advance in pre-tax profits and is raising its dividend by 50 per cent. In the 53 weeks ended May 2 turnover increased by 9.5 per cent to Pounds 21.2m after the group obtained a larger share of the market in generally aggressive competitive conditions. Profit moved up from Pounds 1.42m to Pounds 1.93m after development costs of Pounds 1.95m, broadly unchanged in real terms, and interest costs cut from Pounds 310,000 to Pounds 144,000. The tax rate was reduced to 35.1 (39.3) per cent as profits earned in the UK had risen faster than those overseas. That boosted earnings per share to 8.33p (5.75p) and the dividend is stepped up to 3p (2p) through a final of 1.75p. At the year-end there was a net cash balance of Pounds 319,000 compared with net bank borrowings of Pounds 8,000.</p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A nose for innovation - Calvin Klein's new unisex fragrance is aimed at young consumers The word unisex somehow seems trapped in the 1970s, when entrepreneurs tried to persuade the children of the 1960's sexual revolution to sport the same haircuts, wear the same jeans and use the same toilets. Unisex, or the concept behind it, is now set for a revival as Calvin Klein - the US fashion designer behind such best-selling fragrances as Obsession, Eternity and Escape - prepares for this autumn's launch of cK one, his latest scent. Whereas Eternity, Escape and other perfumes are aimed either at women or men, cK one will be what Calvin Klein calls a 'shared fragrance' for the young consumers who, he believes, are ready to buy a scent created for both sexes. 'It's different from everything else we've done,' says Kimberley Delsing, chairman of Calvin Klein Cosmetics, a subsidiary of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group. 'This company is known for big fragrances with big smells. But our research told us there was a new generation of young consumers out there who want something new and fresh with a lighter smell that doesn't fit into the conventional categories. That's cK one.' Calvin Klein is not the only cosmetics company to have detected a demand from consumers for innovation in the fragrance market. After an uncertain period in which the industry has adopted a conservative approach to product development, a number of other groups - notably L'Oreal of France and Japan's Shiseido - are now becoming more experimental. The prestige perfume market remained relatively resilient during the recession and has grown rapidly as economic conditions have improved. Industry estimates suggest that retail sales have risen by up to 7 per cent in the US and Europe since the start of 1994. Yet profitability has been depressed by the expansion of big companies - such as France's Elf Sanofi and Estee Lauder of the US, as well as L'Oreal, Shiseido and Unilever - which has heralded a new era of escalating advertising budgets. The cost of launching a new fragrance worldwide has risen to Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.6m) thereby raising the risk of costly failures. These pressures have encouraged the industry to play safe in the presentation of new products. The most successful new scents of the 1990s - Tresor from L'Oreal and Champagne, the first Yves Saint-Laurent launch since its acquisition by Elf Sanofi - have targeted the classic fragrance market by reflecting traditional images of luxury in their advertising. The first sign that there was also a demand for something different was the runaway success of the fragrance launched last spring by Jean-Paul Gaultier, the ageing enfant terrible of French fashion. His scent has a fairly classic smell, but breaks all the industry rules with its punky advertising campaign and a bottle (designed by Gaultier himself) in the form of a woman's torso encased in an aluminium can. Chantal Roos, chief executive of Beaute Prestige International (BPI), the Shiseido subsidiary behind Gaultier, says they set out to create a perfume to 'capture the spirit of his fashion - witty, creative, slightly controversial'. The strategy has worked with some European stores running out of the scent last Christmas. 'Gaultier's success taught us all a lesson,' says Georges Klarsfeld, director of L'Oreal. 'It told us that some consumers were tired of seeing the same old images in perfume advertising - the classy women jumping out of private jets or fancy cars. They wanted something they could relate to.' L'Oreal's response is Eden, the new Cacharel fragrance introduced in Europe this spring. Eden is designed to appeal to the ecologically concerned consumers of the 1990s. Its advertising features evocative rainforest scenes and Eden is packaged in a green bottle with no discernible brand name. The bottle is made from an opaline substance that changes colour to ensure that each one is unique. Eden has already beaten its sales targets across Europe, according to Klarsfeld. L'Oreal is now preparing for its US launch next spring. Similarly BPI plans to take Gaultier to North America this autumn. Comme des Garcons and Yohji Yamamoto, two avant garde Japanese designers, are also finalising plans for fragrances which, like Gaultier, will reflect the idiosyncratic themes of their fashion. But the most iconoclastic new product of all is undoubtedly cK one. Having decided to break new ground by launching a 'shared fragrance', Calvin Klein Cosmetics is also adopting an innovative approach to marketing. It has chosen a tactically low price of Dollars 35 for a 100ml bottle of cK one eau de toilette, against Dollars 50 for Obsession. It is also introducing youth-oriented products, such as massage oil, and will sell cK one in unconventional outlets, notably Tower Records music shops. 'The stores are very excited about cK one,' says Delsing. 'But at the end of the day it's the customers who'll decide whether it's a success.'</p>

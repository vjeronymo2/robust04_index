			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Consumer confidence off peak in US Consumer confidence in the US dropped slightly in July and August after a previous four-year high, according to the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index issued yesterday. The monthly index, produced by the New York-based business research group, registered 89.0 in August, down from 91.3 in July and 92.5 in June. The survey, based on a sample of 5,000 households, shows consumers are less positive in their assessment of prevailing economic conditions and less optimistic in their expectations for the month ahead. The index, which is widely viewed as one of the better barometers of consumer spending, reinforces the impression given by recent Commerce Department figures that the pace of economic growth is slowing. The number of respondents who reported in August that business conditions were 'good' had decreased slightly and there was a drop in the number of people who said jobs were 'plentiful'. However, the survey also noted the numbers saying conditions were 'bad' dropped marginally. There was only a small change in predictions for the economy. The proportion of households expecting the economy to improve was down slightly, but optimists outnumbered pessimists by two to one. Mr Fabien Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's consumer research centre, was not too disheartened by the results. Although confidence was lower than a month earlier, 'the present level of confidence has been associated with a reasonably strong economy during the 27-year history of the survey,' he said. New home sales surged 8.3 per cent in July rebounding from a revised 11.4 per cent decline in June, the US Commerce Department announced yesterday. The rise was in line with many analysts' expectations. The Commerce Department also noted that sales of new homes during the first seven months of 1994 were 6.6 per cent above the same period last year. The median price of a new home declined to Dollars 123,000, down 6.1 per cent from Dollars 131,000 in June.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Reuters share price cut by sluggish revenue outlook SHARES IN Reuters Holdings closed 25p lower at 1126p yesterday after the international financial information and news company was unable to predict any improvement in its revenue growth rate. The group reported a 10.2 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 187.4m for the six months to June 30 on turnover of Pounds 748.4m, a rise of 6 per cent. However, the profits figure was boosted by a jump in interest received from Pounds 21.9m to Pounds 32.5m. Operating profit before interest rose by 4.5 per cent, to Pounds 154.7m. Mr Peter Job, chief executive, said there had been a slowdown in revenue growth, as forecast, largely reflecting the lower level of orders taken for the group's financial information services last year. He added: 'While there is a modest improvement in the order level, this is being offset by measures we are taking to fortify our long-term market position. These include packaging of new facilities into existing services free of charge where previously we might have sold them for an extra fee.' Phase two of Dealing 2000, the automated foreign exchange trading system, and Globex, the screen trading system for futures and options, were proving themselves technically, but the extent of their contribution to revenue could not yet be gauged. Reuters also announced plans to increase its role in television by establishing a joint venture with NBC of the US and taking full control of Visnews, the international television news agency. The UK-based group already owns 51 per cent of Visnews and will acquire NBC's 37.5 per cent. It has also agreed in principle to buy the BBC's 11.25 per cent share of the agency, but declined to say how much it was paying for the minorities. Mr Job said: 'We intend to invest in television and make Visnews a more powerful force by extending its operations into Reuters' network of 118 reporting bureaux worldwide.' Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Communications, the television production and services group, is joining the board of Reuters as a non-executive director. Reuters' earnings per share increased 11.4 per cent to 30.3p (27.2p), and the interim dividend rose by 12.8 per cent to 5.3p (4.7p) Global TV expansion, Page 22 Lex, Page 18 Observer, Page 17</p>

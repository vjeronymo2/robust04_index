The meter station's location is Township 24 south, Range 28 east, Section 21 or, more specifically, near mile post 4.2 on FGT's existing Reedy Creek Lateral in Orange County, Florida.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FGT's proposed upgrading will involve removing the first stage of pressure regulation and replacing the second stage of pressure regulation, including inlet and outlet spools, risers, primary header (inlet side of regulator), and other related appurtenant facilities to increase the 150 psig delivery pressure to 250 psig. The construction activity will be done inside FGT's existing gravel and fenced meter station yard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FGT states that Reedy Creek will not have any changes in its certificated levels of service or any increases in its contractual gas quantities. The upgrading will not affect FGT's peak day or annual deliveries, so the present and proposed quantity to be delivered at the Residential Division will remain at up to 4,204 MMBtu per day and up to 1,112,516 MMBtu per year. FGT does state that the end-use will be residential and commercial.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FGT has indicated that the proposed upgrading is not prohibited by its existing tariff and there is sufficient capacity to continue all services without detriment or disadvantage to other customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to &sect;157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Brazil and Argentina reach Mercosur deal Argentina and Brazil have overcome the principal obstacle to the implementation of Mercosur - the planned four-nation customs union that also includes Paraguay and Uruguay - by reaching a compromise on the trade pact's future common external tariffs. Economy and foreign ministers from Argentina and Brazil, meeting near Buenos Aires at the weekend, drew up a detailed pact on the customs union planned to come into force on January 1 next year. The presidents of the four countries will meet in Buenos Aires on Friday for a summit at which they are expected to approve the compromise. A dispute between Argentina and Brazil - the region's largest economies - over common import duties for capital goods, telecommunications equipment and computers had threatened to undermine Mercosur. Argentina levies no duties on the import of these products, whereas Brazil has always protected its high-tech manufacturers. The two have met half-way, with Brazil accepting a lower tariff for these goods and Argentina agreeing to abandon its zero tariff for capital and high-tech goods.</p>

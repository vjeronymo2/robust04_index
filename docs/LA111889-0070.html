			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BENEFIT TRAVELS UP LAZY RIVER BOAT  </P> <P> The Scene  </P> <P> Newport Harbor's Reuben E. Lee river boat-restaurant, where the Red Ribbon 100  women's advisory council to the Orange County chapter of the American Red Cross  -- and hundreds more -- stepped aboard Tuesday for an evening of champagne and  wine tasting.  </P> <P> The moon wasn't quite as full as the showboat (filled to capacity with about  400 guests). Elbows got a full workout, bending frequently to lift those  souvenir champagne glasses and politely prodding their way through the  close-packed crowd.  </P> <P> For the fourth year, the Showboat Champagne Fest was sold out well in advance,  according to event chairwoman Jane Martin. At $65 per person, the event brought  in about $30,000, Martin said.  </P> <P> Most popular table again this year was Robert Mondavi, where a new vintage  (1986) of Opus 1 Cabernet was being uncorked. At $55 a bottle, Opus 1 is the  most expensive domestic wine, according to a Mondavi representative. Those with  even more expensive tastes climbed the stairs to the wheelhouse, where a Remy  Martin representative offered a brief lecture and sips of Louis XIII cognac at  $600 a bottle.  </P> <P> The Buzz  </P> <P> This year the Red Ribbon 100 won't need a meeting to decide where the money  should go. Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco earthquake already made that  decision, Martin said. Awareness of the Red Cross' urgent needs this year made  the revelers more appreciative than ever of their own good fortune.  </P> <P> Dress Code  </P> <P> "Late-day business," according to Red Ribbon member Donna Brownell. That was  defined by guests as anything from I-just-left-the-office attire to sequins and  furs.  </P> <P> On the Menu  </P> <P> A feast of seafood snacks befitting not just a river boat but a cruise ship,  from stir-fried shrimp to oysters Rockefeller, garnished with bread in the  shape of lobsters and alligators. Plus a plethora of desserts.  </P> <P> Overheard  </P> <P> So much for all those nautical terms they taught you in sailing class, mate. On  this boat, starboard was still starboard, but as one crew member explained to a  confused group of tasters, "No, no, no. Port is upstairs. Desserts are  downstairs. . . . "And one guest said to another: "I'll bet if you went around  and tasted every one of these, you could learn an awful lot about wine."  </P> <P> "Yes, but you wouldn't be able to remember any of it."  </P> <P> The event organizers thought of that: Each guest packet included an admonition  to "please be conscientious" with alcohol, and an offer of a taxi ride home, if  necessary.

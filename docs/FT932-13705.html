			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Arts: The Treatment - Theatre The Royal Court Theatre has recently gone very American and rather sophisticated. John Guare's Six Degrees of Separation was not the sort of play you would have expected to see there. Ariel Dorfman's Death and the Maiden was American as well, though Latin. Even a home grown product such as Timberlake Wertenbaker's Three Birds Alighting on a Field combined a touch of New York with Sloane Square. David Mamet's new play about sexual harassment in an American university arrives shortly. All of which, you might say, is a gust of fresh air from across the Atlantic and more than welcome. The American influence, however, has had a malign effect on Martin Crimp, the aspiring British playwright whose new work, The Treatment, opened at the Court on Tuesday. Crimp is a talented writer looking for a subject. He showed great promise in Dealing with Clair, a play set around selling a house through a female estate agent at a time (1988) when the property market was booming. His No-one Sees the Video at the Royal Court Studio two years ago regressed in the sense that it seemed simply to be asserting (without proving) that there is something degrading in market research. Stretches of dialogue are effective; substance is lacking. Crimp wants to satirise but cannot find a target. The Treatment could have been the great leap forward, his first showing in the Royal Court's main house. The aim is ambitious, for it is hard for a British playwright to write effectively about Americans on their own territory: they can do it so well themselves and are quite capable of self-parody. This is Crimp's dilemma. It is not clear whether The Treatment is trying to imitate Mamet or take him off. If the play is meant to satirise the Hollywood machine, it fails completely for what the piece suggests, probably against Crimp's intentions, is that American script-writers are very professional - more so than those who seek to debunk them. It is a very English approach to think that Americans lack sophistication. The plot is not simple. Essentially a girl called Anne (Jacqueline Defferary) offers material from her marriage to be turned into a movie. Directors and script-writers cross-question her, then seek to turn her story into something different to her original tale. Crimp may want this to be seen as a betrayal. Like the market research in No-one Sees the Video, however, the attempt to rewrite seems more like a service than an act of perfidy, the more so since Anne's story was never very clear in the first place. There are some nice inventions, such as the black New York cab-driver who continues to drive despite being blind since birth, though again one wonders  -is this satire, in which case it is painfully unpleasant, or just bizarre? Good scenes, too, in the Japanese New York restaurant, especially from the Brooklyn waitress. There is also one blatant theatrical cliche: a man's eyes being put out on stage. One never liked the scene in King Lear; it seems remarkably out of place here. The acting is very good, notably Sheila Gish as Jennifer, the woman who tries to make sense of Anne's story, cannot stand cigarettes but ends up smoking heavily in the general frustration. The direction is by Lindsay Posner. It is the play that does not work. Royal Court Theatre (071) 730 1745</p>

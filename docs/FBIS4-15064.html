			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 5 TASS -- The Federation Council  hurried to explain that the rejection of budget appropriations  for the second quarter of 1994 "should not be assessed as a  contraposition to the State Duma or the Russian president".    Its press service said in a statement on Tuesday that only  10  lawmakers of the upper chamber were categorically against the  document, while 82 were in favour of it. "The overwhelming  majority voted to create... a conciliatory commission jointly  with Duma members and edit certain articles of the document",  the statement said.    "Such a principled position of the Federation Council is  more  important for the state than an automatic adoption of all  lawbills submitted to the upper chamber without their thorough  study", the document reads.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Tokyo unveils Pounds 37bn spending package JAPAN'S new government yesterday announced Y6,150bn (Pounds 37.3bn) in government spending, deregulation and measures to pass on the rewards of the yen's strength to consumers. The measures, the government's first big economic initiative, are designed to help pull the country back from the edge of recession. To widespread disappointment it fell short of proposing income tax cuts. Business groups have urged tax reductions, but the seven-party coalition is divided on fiscal policy and the finance ministry is unwilling to lose revenue. The package brings to Y18,350bn the amount set aside so far this year to stimulate the flagging economy, after a Y13,200bn plan by the previous government in April. Most of that has yet to be spent. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, admitted that yesterday's measures were insufficient to revive the economy, but did not exclude further action. The yen rose against the dollar, while Tokyo stock prices fell sharply. The Nikkei average closed 445.64 points lower at 20,502.15. The plans received a lukewarm reception from economic analysts, but a cordial response from the US, which has been urging Japan to stimulate the economy to restrict its record trade surplus. Mr Laurence Summers, the US Treasury undersecretary, who is visiting Tokyo, said he was pleased to see Mr Hosokawa introduce such measures so soon after taking office. UK Treasury officials welcomed the measures to boost the economy and open markets, but said it was not clear that they would bring recovery. Mr John Major, prime minister, begins a visit to Tokyo at the week-end. Hosokawa's first economic package fails to excite, Page 6</p>

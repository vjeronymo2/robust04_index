			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE '80S A SPECIAL REPORT;  </P> <P> TASTE MAKERS;  </P> <P> PRESENTING THE BIG PLAYERS AND MAJOR IDEAS THAT -- FOR BETTER OR WORSE --  SHAPED THE 1980S. THIS IS CALENDAR'S FIFTH ANNUAL TASTE MAKERS REPORT, EXPANDED  THIS TIME TO COVER THE LAST 10 YEARS IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: SHOW BUSINESS  EXECS, FILM PRODUCERS, FILM DIRECTORS AND WRITERS, STAGE, TV, MUSIC, DANCE, POP  MUSIC, JAZZ, COMEDY, RADIO, ART AND RESTAURANTS.;  </P> <P> COMEDY;  </P> <P> DAVID LETTERMAN  </P> <P> Letterman is our last TV anti-hero. He came along at a time when the talk show  format had grown bankrupt and no one wanted to admit it. The talk show wasn't  about real conversation and the individual features of character, it was about  self-promotion and plugola, and his new "Late Night With David Letterman"  instantly took on the refreshingly uncertain edge of self-parody.  </P> <P> Some of the tastelessness and exploitiveness has been trimmed from the show  since its debut, but there's still just enough of a kernel of self-hate in  Letterman to insure that he'll never quite believe his success, and therefore  he'll never be its victim.  </P> <P> Now the talk show genre is back with a vengeance as Oprah and Donahue and  Geraldo and Sally Jessy sort through the American laundry in a renewed format  that exposes just what a lonely place America can be. Lonely and loud and  tacky. Letterman loves tacky, and he still has a soft spot in his heart for the  human zoo. But there isn't a lot of nourishment in his format. How long can he  keep going?  </P> <P> The Taste Makers project was edited by David Fox, assistant Sunday Calendar  editor. Lawrence Christon  </P></p>

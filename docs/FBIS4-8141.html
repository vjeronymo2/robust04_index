			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Teodora Encheva] </F>   [Text] STANDART NEWS learned on 5 April that Father  Gelemenov's "skinheads," Dr. Ivan Georgiev's people, Russian  Cossacks, and Bulgarian volunteers are ready to leave for Serbia  as soon as Turkey sends "Blue Helmets" there. The Fatherland  Party of Labor [OPT] and the Russian All-National Union  [Ruskiyat obshtenaroden suyuz] (ROS) have informed the state  leaderships of the Republic of Bulgaria and the Russian  Federation that they will send volunteers to our western  neighbor with a view to ensuring equilibrium. Anatoliy  Dolgopolov, a Cossack from the Kuban and a parliament deputy of  the Russian Path party, declared: I think that no state or  parliament will forget about its peoples and fail to protect  them. At the moment I have no troops, Dolgopolov said, but if  anyone dares to encroach upon Bulgaria's interests...,"  suggestively failing to complete his sentence.    Father Gelemenov told STANDART NEWS: "My lads (the  'skinheads' -- editorial note) say that it is quite easy to  enroll as a volunteer in Serbia." Gelemenov said that last year  he wanted to leave for Bosnia, but a woman called Petya had  become very dear to him, and this stopped him from going. The  leader of the unregistered National Socialist Party claims that  Bulgarian mercenaries received 2,500 German marks a month. He  said he know of special offices in Serbia that recruited  volunteers and sent them for training. The nationalist parties  do not intend to found a special union of volunteers, but they  will encourage them, Gelemenov said.    A source close to the Bulgarian "Blue Helmets" association  declared that four or five former "Blue Helmets" from Cambodia  are already on the territory of southern Yugoslavia. The source  said they left on a trip abroad and, at the moment, are earning  their livings as professional rangers.    The Defense Ministry refused to make any comment, because it  regards the statement issued by the OPT and ROS as a piece of  utter nonsense.    Nikolay Slatinski told STANDART NEWS: This is nonsense, and  it repeats the incredible stupidity of those who applauded the  bombing of the Serbian positions in Sarajevo. As chairman of  the Parliamentary National Security Commission, he added, I am  against the idea of sending volunteers to former Yugoslavia,  although we are Slavs and Christians.    The people who signed this document should be reported to  the  prosecutor, Zhan Videnov, leader of the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist  Party], told STANDART NEWS. It is a technical omission that so  far the PSSD [Parliamentary Union for Social Democracy] has not  stated any official viewpoint on the fascist statements and  activities of Father Gelemenov. Mr. Videnov considers that  Bulgaria should reconfirm its stance of nonintervention in the  Yugo-conflict. Yesterday the Socialist leader refused to have a  meeting with the Russian Path party, which under the  chairmanship of Sergey Baburin represents the ROS in the Russian  Duma.</p>

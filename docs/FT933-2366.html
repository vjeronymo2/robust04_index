			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (15): Keep it in the family - on your own terms - Creating a trust / Great care is needed in drafting the legal document, and in the selection of trustees, if it is both to satisfy the Inland Revenue and also to be effective against rapacious relatives ANY SERIOUS investor knows how difficult it is to make capital and how easy it is to lose it. But a trust can be a useful weapon in an armoury to protect capital from rapacious relatives and the ravages of taxation. A trust is the legal relationship between a settlor (the person who provides the funds), the trustee (the person who holds the funds), and the beneficiary (the person for whom the funds are held). The settlor creates a trust, usually by means of a document, which can either be part of a Will, in which case it does not come into effect until death, or by a trust deed, in which case it can come into effect as soon as the funds are transferred to the trustees. To be effective against rapacious relatives, the trust must be carefully drafted. For example, if you want your son to inherit your wealth, but not so as to fritter your capital on wasting assets, you could include a trust in your Will, so that he is only paid the income during his lifetime, but is not entitled to the capital without the trustees' consent. The capital can thereby be protected for his children provided your trustees have invested the capital sensibly and are able to resist your family's frivolous demands. Of course, this means that you must choose your trustees and their successors with care. During your lifetime there is no reason why you and your spouse should not be trustees, with or without a trusted adviser or friend. Only if there is no one you trust and who is resident in a suitable jurisdiction need you pick a professional trustee. A suitable jurisdiction is one which recognises trusts, such as the UK or the Channel Islands. An unsuitable jurisdiction is one which does not recognise the Anglo Trust, such as France or Germany. To be tax-efficient, a trust should be drafted by a lawyer familiar with trust tax legislation. For example, a simple clause giving the trustees power to accumulate the income could dramatically affect the trust's tax-effectiveness. Trusts are taxed according to the type of trust and the relationship between the settlor and the beneficiary. The type of trust depends on what the trustees can do with the income of the trust fund. If the trustees must pay all the income of the trust to a particular beneficiary - the 'life tenant'  -then the trust is an 'interest in possession' trust. All other trusts are 'discretionary' trusts, because the trustees either have discretion as to which beneficiary should receive the income or how much the beneficiary should get, leaving the trustees free to accumulate what remains of the income with the existing capital of the trust fund. One important sub-class of a discretionary trust is the 'accumulation and maintenance' trust, for children under the age of 25. Provided the conditions set out in the inheritance tax legislation are met, the penal IHT provisions imposed on discretionary trusts can then be avoided. Family wishes and tax objectives are not always compatible, but with care a good compromise can usually be found. For example, say you would like to set up a trust to take advantage of the favourable IHT provisions which you do not think will last for many more years. Your children are aged only 18 and 20, and at the moment you have no grandchildren. Ideally, you would like to set up a discretionary trust for your children and grandchildren, so that the capital and income can be accumulated until such time as either your children or your grandchildren (assuming you get any) need it. However, you do not want to pay up to a maximum of 20 per cent IHT on setting it up or up to 6 per cent IHT every 10 years. One way of achieving your wishes in the most tax-efficient way would be to set up an accumulation and maintenance settlement for your children, so that the income can be accumulated, at least until your children reach the age of 25. Thereafter, the trust will become an interest in possession trust, and the income will have to be paid to your children or for their benefit. However, provided the children are well provided for, there is nothing to stop you as trustee switching the investment policy, so that little or no income arises to the trust and therefore little or no money need be paid out of the trust to the children at that time. Then, when the grandchildren arrive, you, as trustee, can exercise a power of appointment and appoint part or all of the funds away from your children to your grandchildren, at which point the income can once again be accumulated without adverse tax consequences. The most tax effective trust, of course, is one set up by a 'non-UK domiciled' settlor for UK resident beneficiaries (one of whom could be the settlor) with trustees resident in a tax haven. This trust can effectively avoid UK income tax, capital gains tax and inheritance tax if carefully structured and managed. If a trust is to be created, for whatever reason, it must be remembered that tax laws can change, beneficiaries can die out of order, and people can live longer or shorter than expected. It is not always possible to unravel a trust, and therefore it should be drafted with care, treated with respect and not entered into lightly.

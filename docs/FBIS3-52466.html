			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Special to the JORDAN TIMES by Suhayr 'Ubaydat] </F>   [Text] Amman--Six leftist political parties Monday [3  January] criticised the JD [Jordanian dinars] 1,487 billion  draft budget for 1994 and called on the Lower House of  Parliament to reject it.    A joint statement issued by the six said the draft budget,  which is under study by the Finance Committee of the House,  placed the greater burden of economic reform on the poor and  thus deepened the gap between the rich and poor.    The statement, a copy of which was made available to the  JORDAN TIMES, was signed by the Jordanian Communist Party, the  communist Arab Ba'th Party, the Jordanian Popular Unity Party,  the Jordanian Democratic People's Party (Hashd), the Jordanian  Socialist Democratic Party and the Jordanian Democratic Arab  Party.    It called on the House to reject the draft budget, presented  to parliament in mid-December by Finance Minister Sami Qammuh,  and "defend the people's right to their daily bread,"    Listing its own version of the objectives of the country's  economic policy, the statement said that economic development in  the past two years did not justify the increase in local  revenues (mainly from indirect taxes and fees).    The statement asserted that the expected introduction of a  sales tax would "increase the production costs of the local  industries and lead to a general price increase in market, and  raise the poverty line..."    Other byproducts of the sales tax, according to the  statement, will be a decline in demand for local products and  investment and an increase in unemployment.    The statement called for a link between prices and wages and  a minimum level of wages "in accordance with all related studies  of living costs and the poverty line."    It claimed that the increase in the income and profit taxes  came mainly from shareholding companies and employees, "which  indicates that the percentage of tax evasion is still very high."    On expenditure, the statement claims that there is no  serious  attempt to reduce the deficit by decreasing expenditure, "rather  it is about increasing revenues while maintaining the level of  expenditure."    The statement said that the budget is not "deficit-free" as  described by Mr. Qammuh, but that there is a deficit of JD 450  million "to be covered by local and foreign aid and loans."    The statement concluded by some suggestions to "treat the  economic situation and the budget, including an increase in the  salaries of active and retired civil servants and the military."    In his daily column which appeared in the Arabic daily  AL-RA'Y Monday economist Fahd al-Fanik accused those advocating  an increase in salaries as being "irresponsible."    He said that there is no guarantee that the International  Monetary Fund (IMF) will reschedule Jordan's debts "regardless  of our adherence to the economic reform programme, which  includes decreasing the budget deficit."</p>

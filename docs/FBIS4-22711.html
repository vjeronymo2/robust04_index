			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Mikhaylov, VLADIVOSTOK: "Most Maritime </F> Kray Residents Live Below or Near Poverty Level"]    [Text] During this difficult time of transition to  the market, kray statistical administration specialists are  surveying 550 Maritime Kray families on a monthly basis. The  social snapshot provided by this is quite sufficient to arrive  at certain conclusions regarding the current life of the  "average" Maritime Kray resident.    The latest survey showed that as of 1 April monetary income  per family member has increased somewhat and amounts to 120,420  rubles [R]. Of this amount, 40 percent goes for food, and this  expense continues to grow.    Prices grew at a slower rate in March and even fell with  respect to some products; this to a certain extent increased  their consumption in some families. For instance, consumption of  meat and meat products increased by 200 g, milk--by 700 g, and  eggs--by three eggs. At the same time, consumption of fish and  fish products declined because of higher prices.    The statistics also registered that of the 12 groups of  monitored basic foodstuffs, only potato consumption remains at  the rational norm level (8.8 kg a month per person). As to meat  and milk products, fish, vegetables and fruit, their consumption  lags below the norm by a factor of 1.5 to three.    The cost of the physiological maintenance minimum in March  amounted to R96,149; 38 percent of kray residents have income  below this level. Among them are first and foremost pensioners,  whose average monthly pension amounted to only R43,000.    Differentiation of the population by level of income and  material situation may be seen from the table.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Kray population a-|in percent        |families (thousan-|  |                  |s of 1 April 1994 |                  |ds)               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total             |2,287             |100               |716               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Including with pe-|                  |                  |                  |  |r capita monthly  |                  |                  |                  |  |income, rubles    |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |up to 5,000       |9.1               |0.4               |2.9               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |5,001-10,000      |4.6               |0.2               |1.4               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |10,001-25,000     |86.9              |3.8               |27.2              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |25,001-40,000     |118.9             |5.2               |37.2              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |40,001-50,000     |80.0              |3.5               |25.1              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |50,001-70,000     |189.8             |8.3               |59.4              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |70,001-80,000     |153.3             |6.7               |48.0              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |80,001-96,150     |228.7             |10.0              |71.6              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |96,150-100,000    |73.2              |3.2               |22.9              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |100,001-200,000   |1,010.9           |44.2              |316.5             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |200,001-400,000   |288.2             |12.6              |90.2              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |over 400,000      |43.2              |1.9               |13.6              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      As we can see, there is considerable stratification of the  kray population by income level. It should be noted that if the  "poverty line" is defined as R96,000 and 38 percent of the kray  population are below it, we can hardly call the situation of  those with an income between R96,000 and R200,000 enviable. And  such people account for 47 percent of the kray population. We  should not assume, however, that the number of wealthy people  with an income of R400,000 in the kray is precisely as the table  shows. This is only the official data. In reality, there are  many more rich people in the kray, but they do not particularly  wish to advertise their income.</p>

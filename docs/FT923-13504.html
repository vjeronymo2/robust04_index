			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / International Company News: KIO deflects blame over Ercros KUWAIT'S main investment body yesterday responded to claims that it had mismanaged a multi-billion dollar investment portfolio in Spain by leaking a lengthy defence of its actions to the official Kuna news agency, Reuter reports from Kuwait. An 'official source' at the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) blamed other investors for the collapse of a chemicals company, Ercros, in its portfolio, and said KIO was happy to pay out a Pounds 100m Eurobond if nervous investors demanded it. It was the first official response to reports that the KIO, known as one of the world's most powerful investors, may lose hundreds of millions of dollars and damage its international credibility through the partial collapse of its Spanish portfolio, put at about Dollars 7bn. Western diplomats and economists say the KIO's worldwide portfolio may have sunk to below Dollars 40bn from a pre-Gulf war total of about Dollars 100bn. At some stages in the 1980s, Kuwait was earning more from investments than from its oil exports. Kuwaiti investment officials in Kuwait have declined to comment. The al-Watan newspaper reported yesterday that the KIO's deputy chairman, Mr Khaled al-Sabah, had tended his resignation but it had not so far been accepted. KIO's Spanish portfolio has come under scrutiny after Ercros announced 10 days ago it was due to file for court protection on its Dollars 302m debt. Ercros' bankruptcy allows investors in a Pounds 100m bond issued by the KIO's main investment vehicle in Spain, Grupo Torras, to redeem the bond early, which would be a serious setback to the Kuwaiti fund's reputation. In the statement to Kuna, a senior unnamed official said the KIO was trying to negotiate with the Spanish government and Spanish creditors to share responsibility for refloating Ercros, which the KIO had borne alone in the past. 'Torras is obviously sorry that one of the companies it holds shares in could reach this stage . . . but in the end it considers itself an investor looking for profit and avoiding loss,' the official said.</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Putting roofs over the heads of aces - Nick Garnett meets the people who house the globetrotting stars of Wimbledon STARTING a small company without training, and dealing with an activity about which you have no real knowledge, is hardly the best way to succeed. Sometimes, though, it can work. In the mid-1980s, Jane Cussons, a part-time actress and television producer, found herself with another part-time job: driving players from hotels to Wimbledon for the annual tennis championships. Out of the blue, one player - New Zealander Kelly Evernden - asked her to help in finding a house to rent for the following year's tournament. From this off-the-cuff beginning, Tennis London was formed. Operating from a rickety office up a narrow, creaking staircase above a printer in London's West End, the venture is one of those little niche businesses that provide useful supplementary income while rarely generating enough to give their owners a full-time living. Tennis London gets all its revenue from finding temporary accommodation in houses and flats for people connected with the annual Queen's Club and Wimbledon events: players, sponsoring companies, reporters and television crews. For the year ending next month - which includes last year's Wimbledon  -Tennis London handled Pounds 320,000 in rent, producing a fee income of about Pounds 50,000. A third of that is absorbed by running costs, leaving the two owners, Cussons and Shelagh Shipley, to share around Pounds 30,000 between them. For this, they work about three days a week - except in the period leading up to and during the competitions - and can take a full break of more than a month late in summer. 'No one else really does what we do,' says Cussons. 'There is lots of administration involved in handling short lets over such a short period of the year and it is not worthwhile unless a property agency is set up for it.' The business took off only slowly and Cussons worked from home at first. In 1989-90, Tennis London earned just Pounds 11,000 from gross rents of Pounds 85,000 on 40 lets during the season. In this financial year, gross rents almost four times higher were arranged on nearly 150 lets. Cussons says the company has a close relationship with Queen's and the All England club, which runs Wimbledon. Both recommend Tennis London to players and the sport management companies that represent them - and usually arrange their travelling and tournament living arrangements. Much of the business comes from word of mouth. And while some estate agents do handle short lets for Wimbledon, many others pass on enquiries to Tennis London, which has around 600 flats and houses in Wimbledon and central London on its register. 'Home-owners come to us and we now have more than we require, particularly because of the recession,' says Shipley. 'Three years ago, we had only one house in Somerset Road, Wimbledon, which is a very select area. Last year, we had five.' She scoffs at newspaper stories suggesting that some owners are raking in Pounds 15,000 in rents for the two weeks of Wimbledon. The spread, she says, is from Pounds 300 a week for a one-bedroom flat to Pounds 3,500 for the best six-bedroom house. Shipley adds: 'Even star players never pay more than Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 2,500 a week. Sometimes, owners read about these huge rental figures and will not believe you when you tell them these are wrong. They think they can get Pounds 2,000 a week for a three-bed semi.' (The real figure is more like Pounds 750). Whatever the level, Tennis London takes a 15 per cent slice. The company circulates a limited number of brochures with details of its properties, but negotiates mainly by giving these details direct to players and their agents via letters and fax. Players such as Andre Agassi and Michael Stich find homes through Tennis London, but they do not need to climb the creaking stairs first. One of the company's particular problems is its seasonal nature: Cussons employs an extra person from April to July and four others during the tournaments, mainly to let people into their rented homes. Another problem is coping with the inevitable crises that arise during tournaments: players locking themselves out, washing machines flooding kitchens, lavatories breaking down. With these in mind, Tennis London has a plumber on call. There are, of course, other awkward moments. 'One flat-owner forgot to pay his electricity bill and power was cut off for a day and a half,' says Cussons. 'I went up to the electricity board office to pay the bill but the tenant was not pleased.' Tennis London's overheads are low: about Pounds 15,000 a year, including office rent. Lacking business training, its owners use a standard Law Society contract form for the lets, with a few additions suggested by a solicitor. Perhaps surprisingly, players cause few headaches. Cussons says: 'The most important criteria is that properties should have pump showers, video recorders and washing machines and, if they are staying in Wimbledon, they like to be within walking distance of the tournament. South Africans and Australians are real sweeties. Americans can be a little demanding about accommodation.' Shipley says that while many players and sponsors still prefer to stay in hotels, she believes there is scope for growth. But the company occupies such a small niche that the owners recently recruited a full-time saleswoman to run a conventional house rental operation from the same office.

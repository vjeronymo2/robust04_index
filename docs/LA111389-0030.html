			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : MEDIA;  </P> <P> MEXICAN OWNERS OUST GM, CHANGE XHRM-FM FORMAT  </P> <P> San Diego's only radio station managed by blacks and specifically targeting the  black community, XHRM-FM (92.5), has new management and a new music format, the  result of a long-running dispute between the station operators and its Mexican  owners.  </P> <P> At the end of October, Willie Morrow, general manager of XHRM for the past nine  years, was told to cease operating the station by executives of Radio Moderna  Mexicana, owners of the station. Under Morrow, the station featured soul,  gospel and rap music.  </P> <P> With Morrow out, the station has switched to a "power" format, featuring dance  and light rock music.  </P> <P> Morrow paid a monthly fee to the Mexican company for the right to broadcast  over its Tijuana-based signal, much like the American-based Noble Broadcasting  has an agreement to operate the Mexican-based XTRA.  </P> <P> However, by the end of October, Morrow had not paid his monthly $55,000 user  fee for two months.  </P> <P> Best known as the force behind the successful California Curl cosmetics company  and the San Diego Monitor weekly newspaper, Morrow says he refused to pay rent  to protest the owner's lack of responsiveness to the station's financial  problems.  </P> <P> The disagreements started in January, 1988, Morrow said, when the station's  Tijuana transmitter was blown down in a storm. Although a temporary antenna was  put up a few days later, a permanent tower was not built for another nine  months, Morrow said. The station's signal was severely weakened with the  temporary antenna, he said.  </P> <P> By the time the antenna was back, Morrow said, the station's ratings had  plummeted.  </P> <P> "At that point I lost all my national accounts," Morrow said.  </P> <P> Continued problems with the studio equipment, which Morrow said he spent  thousands of dollars to repair, further exacerbated the station's problems.  Morrow wanted the owners to help absorb the costs of the repairs, and the  income lost from the transmitter problems.  </P> <P> Morrow hoped his refusal to pay rent would force the owners to help the station  through rough times. Instead, they ousted Morrow and took control of the  station.  </P> <P> Representatives of Moderna Mexicana could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Morrow said he is seeking legal advice.  </P> <P> "I think this is very unfair," Morrow said. "When a natural disaster (knocks  down the transmitter) I think the owners should share (in the costs)."  </P> <P> Which came first, the controversy or the news coverage?  </P> <P> Tuesday night's episode of "thirtysomething" included a scene depicting two  homosexual men in bed together.  </P> <P> As soon as the show was over, the KGTV (Channel 10) news team was touting  reports about the "controversial" scene. During the 11 p.m. newscast, three  people representing different viewpoints were on hand to analyze the episode,  much like color commentators at a sports events.  </P> <P> Obviously, Channel 10 decided there was going to be a controversy long before  the show went on the air. ABC had warned its affiliates about the scene before  Tuesday, giving stations ample time to develop news coverage.  </P> <P> As it turned out, Channel 10 received "three or four" phone calls about the  scene Tuesday night, an unusual amount of complaints for that time of night,  according to Channel 10 news director Paul Sands.  </P> <P> "I personally thought it was interesting," said Sands, who believes the  homosexual love scene may have been a first for network television.  </P> <P> By the next day, ABC affiliates around the country were receiving calls about  the scene, perhaps fueled by the news coverage. Without the prompt news  coverage, there might not have been such a public stink, which leaves ABC open  to charges that the scene was included simply as a cheap publicity stunt.  </P> <P> Jeff Apregan is out as general manager of KCBQ. The new station owners, Adams  Communications, which will take over the station later this month, have hired  Dan Carelli, general sales manager for the Edens Broadcasting station in Tampa,  WRBQ, to be the new general manager. WRBQ features the same Top 40 dance music  format used by its San Diego sister station, KKLQ (Q106).  </P> <P> Eagle 105 fans also will notice that new billboards going up today throughout  the county do not include the Eagle 105 moniker. The new station owners simply  want to emphasize the traditional KCBQ call letters, according to a station  spokeswoman.  </P> <P> However, the entrance of new owners, Carelli's hiring and the new billboards  sans Eagle 105 all fuel speculation that a format change may be in the  station's future. Not so, say station staffers, pointing to the recent Arbitron  rating trends report, which show Eagle making strong gains, particularly among  listeners 25-54.  </P> <P> Heads are bowed in silent remorse at Channel 8 due to the news that The Man,  Dan Rather, will not be coming to San Diego. Seems news events in Germany have  preempted his trip west to schmooze with local affiliates. However, the  community forum, "San Diego Under Siege: A Town Meeting About Drugs," scheduled  for tonight at 7 at Crawford High School, will continue as planned, with Ted  Leitner handling the host duties solo. The forum will air Tuesday at 8 p.m. . .  .  </P> <P> Attorneys for KNSD-TV (Channel 39) plan to file a motion for new trial in the  case of Naomi O'Hara. Two weeks ago, a jury ordered Channel 39 to pay O'Hara  $300,000 because of the station's 1983 news report that erroneously labeled her  a prostitute. A grand jury report had detailed a night of barhopping featuring  O'Hara, then-County Supervisor Paul Eckert and a third woman, who was later  charged with prostitution. Channel 39 will seek a new trial on the grounds that  the judge inaccurately allowed the jury to hear psychiatric testimony. If the  motion fails, Channel 39 will appeal the jury's decision, according to attorney  Steven Davis. . . .  </P> <P> A viewer might have concluded that television news departments are desperate  for story ideas after both Channel 10 and Channel 8 chose Monday to do features  on cholesterol. Or maybe there was some pressing new angle? No, it was simply a  ratings sweeps week, and health issues always go over well with viewers. It was  simply a coincidence that they picked the same day to do the stories on the  same subject. . . .  </P> <P> Last month, KGMG was announcing plans to simulcast its classic rock FM (102.1)  format on its AM (1320) station. But it backed off after complaints from fans  of the big band and oldies format on the AM. . . .  </P> <P> Officials of Home Box Office have asked to see tapes of "Kill Them With  Comedy," the locally produced comedy show airing on community-access cable  channels throughout the county. HBO is developing an all-comedy channel.  </P></p>

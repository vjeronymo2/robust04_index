			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REFLECTIONS: 'BUFFALOES ARE VERY LEAN ANIMALS, SO IT ULTIMATELY RESULTS IN A  MEAT THAT IS LOW IN FAT, CHOLESTEROL AND CALORIES.'  </P> <P> Ken Childs, once a tool salesman in Central California, now has a home where  the buffalo roam. And to him, it approximates paradise. Childs and his wife,  Denice, both 37, have a buffalo ranch in Ramona, which produced the American  Bison Assn.'s Gold Trophy Champion for 1989. Times staff writer Leslie Wolf  interviewed Ken Childs at the Star B Ranch in Ramona, and Kenneth Lam  photographed him.  </P> <P>  People think of San Diego as palm trees and yachts and beaches, yet they  should realize that the No. 1 buffalo in the nation came from right here in San  Diego.  </P> <P> We started raising buffalo mainly out of a need to keep this ranch in the  family. My wife's father had the ranch for about a year before we came here to  manage it for him. He's a big businessman up in Los Angeles. I had a  tool-distributing business, but typical of any business, it just totally  drained my time and my family life was suffering. We knew we had to make a  change. Then the opportunity came up here, and my wife's father urged us to  come down and see what we could do.  </P> <P> Our first intention was to develop, but it didn't take us long to see this is a  special place. We thought we'd try to create a business here first.  </P> <P> We needed an idea. We looked into horses and cattle, but realistically, 1,000  acres is not enough to raise a lot of cattle, and the horse business is very  competitive. We heard about exotic animals, so we looked into it, and here we  are nine years later, full on into the buffalo business.  </P> <P> We had a lot of learning to do. We had to build up all the fences around the  place, and build a good solid corral. Then we had to create a market for the  buffalo meat.  </P> <P> I don't have much marketing experience, but I really like what I'm selling.  Buffalo meat is becoming more and more in demand because buffaloes are very  lean animals, so it ultimately results in a meat that is low in fat,  cholesterol and calories. It has a lower cholesterol content than chicken. It's  good for heart patients who are starving for a good old burger. We also do not  give them any growth stimulants or steroids, so the public really appreciates  that. It tastes just like beef, but actually has more flavor to it because it  has less fat.  </P> <P> It also gives the restaurants a good gimmick. Everybody can relate to the  history of the American bison. . . . Most people don't know it, but an influx  of water buffalo is coming into the country, and the quality of meat doesn't  even compare. So we tell people to make sure they're getting American bison  meat.  </P> <P> We also sell buffalo skulls, trophy heads, bones, and hides to make buffalo  robes from. We ship the skulls everywhere, especially to art galleries because  of the Southwestern art interest right now. It gets back to the Plains Indian  and how they utilized the buffalo as their lifeblood. They worshipped the  buffalo. You can decorate buffalo skulls in ways that have a lot of spiritual  meaning, but I'm not an Indian and don't profess to know the spiritual  meanings, so I try to stay away from that.  </P> <P> A lot of people ask me if bison isn't an endangered species, but they are not.  They were protected by the government back around 1874, so that hunters  wouldn't wipe out the species. The government put the buffalo in different  state parks, and they did very well at preserving the herd. Their numbers got  to be so many, they started selling them to the public, which makes it possible  for people like us to raise them.  </P> <P> The only wild herd left is in Yellowstone Park. But they have a disease called  brucellosis, which is a problem, and the herd is getting so big they are  leaving the park. You just can't have a bunch of buffalo roaming around free  into highways and towns. The state of Montana is giving out permits for people  to go shoot them, and it's causing a lot of problems. The buffalo are the ones  suffering, unfortunately.  </P> <P> Even the ones on this ranch are wild animals, basically. Some of them will eat  out of your hand, but that's about as friendly as we get. They can be very  dangerous, actually, because they know how to use those horns and they can ruin  you real quick. I've been chased many times, but fortunately I've always gotten  away.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Dineyev report: "Moscow Government Sitting. </F> Moscow Authorities Ready To Override Laws"]    [Text] Yesterday's session of the city administration  discussed a draft decree on progress made to carry out Mayor  Yuriy Luzhkov's directive "On the Imposition of Special Rules of  Sojourn in the City of Moscow, the Russian Federation Capital,  for Citizens Permanently Resident Outside Russia." Speakers at  the session put forward such radical ideas on tightening the  rules in Moscow that they themselves came to doubt their  legality. However, Luzhkov thought, Moscow will live in  accordance with its own ideas of human rights even if they  contravene the laws in force.    The Moscow administration has been more active of late in  pressing for the recognition of Moscow as a city with a special  status. Yesterday, for example, it was proposed during the  session to further tighten the registration rules in force in  Moscow by increasing liability and the size of fine for  violating them. The majority of participants in the session  felt that citizens trying to evade registration should be  subject to "extremely large" fines, a detention for up to 30  days, and subsequent expulsion from Moscow.    Yesterday's discussion, however, was not limited to the  questions of registration of visitors in Moscow. Mayor Yuriy  Luzhkov announced a new presidential edict on combating banditry  and organized crime which considerably widens the powers of law  and order organs. The mayor thought the document gives the  go-ahead for resolute actions by the Moscow administration. In  this connection, Luzhkov proposed a series of steps aimed at  freeing the city from "visiting thieves" and stabilizing the  crime situation in the city. In particular he declared it  necessary to demand that the Foreign Ministry tighten the visa  rules for citizens arriving in Moscow from countries "with a  complex situation," having in mind the developing countries of  Africa and Asia. The Moscow government premier thinks that in  imposing tough measures one should not be hidebound by  legislation because "it is especially important to throw out of  Moscow those who should not be here."    Sergey Dontsov, head of the City Hall legal administration,  tried to argue against the view of his own boss. Dontsov thinks  sending people outside the limits of Moscow and Russia is not  only a violation of the right to freedom of movement, it is  simply an ineffective measure because "those thrown out go back  to the city without ever reaching their destination." "We  override laws by bringing in new rules while you render the  registration rule impotent," the mayor retorted.</p>

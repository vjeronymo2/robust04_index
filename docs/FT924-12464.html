			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Recession chills Green parties: A decline in political fortunes THE DEATH in peculiarly macabre circumstances of two leading personalities from the German Green movement comes at a highly difficult moment for Europe's ecology parties. The waif-like figure of Ms Petra Kelly - sympathetic, mercurial, articulate and neurotic - became an early symbol of the Greens' Europe-wide potency as the movement picked up momentum in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Her demise, together with that of her companion, Mr Gert Bastian, coincides with a decline in the Greens' political fortunes in most countries across the continent. There is no shortage of awareness of the importance of environmental issues, registered in the membership figures of organisations like Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. Greenpeace's German organisation has 700,000 members - roughly 20 times as many as the German Greens. But the environmental movement in most European countries is weathering a crisis. Not only has fractiousness replaced cohesion as the main political hallmark of many Green parties, the economic downturn has cast a considerable pall over efforts to make Green issues a government priority. Mr Jonathon Porritt, one of Britain's best-known environment campaigners, said last month that he would cease to play an active role in the Green party. Paying tribute yesterday to Ms Kelly's importance in building up the Greens' international reputation, he pointed to the 'central paradox' of the movement. 'It flourishes only when unsustainable economic growth also flourishes. If awareness, activity and commitment depend on policies which end up destroying the earth, we will have to think of ways of countering that.' Ms Kelly was a folk heroine of the west German Greens' political upsurge up to the mid-1980s. She imparted life and energy to environmental ideas which, in many cases, have permeated the policies of mainstream parties throughout the continent. Commenting on Ms Kelly's drive well beyond Germany's borders, Mr Gerd Leipold, disarmament co-ordinator of Greenpeace International, and a former head of Greenpeace Germany, said yesterday, 'Everyone was impressed and a bit frightened by her activities. She was very active, if not hyperactive.' Yet Ms Kelly became progressively disillusioned with the Greens' standing in Germany and abroad during the past few years. As long ago as 1987, she voiced deep discontent that the party had developed into 'a typical German party' beset by theological feuding and factional rivalry. In the December 1990 unified German elections, the Greens lost their representation in the Bundestag. In the past two years, Ms Kelly was particularly mortified by the negative effects of reunification on former members of the dissident movement in eastern Germany. Ironically, it has been France - long disdained by the German Greens as a place where environmental issues were given minimal hearing - where the movement has lately received its strongest international boost. In last March's regional elections, 18 per cent of the electorate voted for France's two ecology parties, the Verts, headed by Antoine Waechter, a European MP from Alsace, and Generation Ecologie (GE) headed by Mr Brice Lalonde, a former environment minister in the Socialist government. The vote made them the third largest political force in France after the Socialists and the right, and gave the Verts the first chairmanship of a regional council. In Germany, if federal elections were held tomorrow, the Greens would probably re-enter parliament as a result of protest votes triggered by the economic and social consequences of unification. But the thought is likely to be of little consolation to Green party activists who, across much of Europe, seem simply to have lost their way.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana has explained  the agreements reached by NATO and the Partnership for Peace  [PFP] to the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Congress of  Deputies.    Javier Solana highlighted the Spanish Government's decision  to take part in cooperation agreements reached by the Western  allies with Central and East European countries. Javier Solana:    [Begin Solana recording] The government wants to play an  active role in these cooperation activities linking the allies  to Central and East European countries. Our country has already  signed several cooperation agreements with Central European  countries, which establish bilateral military cooperation  programs; we will try to strengthen these programs.    Spain has achieved -- in several cases -- development in  certain fields that is comparable to that in these countries.  We think that we can add experiences in the defense field that  can be particularly useful to these countries.    At the same time, and more specifically in the PFP  framework,  we will also take part in other multilateral cooperation  activities with other Alliance member countries. [end recording]</p>

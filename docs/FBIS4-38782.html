			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 1 Jun -- Supreme Council deputies have  approved a protocol of instruction from the Commission on Human  Rights, Ethnic Minorities and Interethnic Relations, while the  Commission for Issues of Legal Policy has prepared a final  version of the resolution on the situation in Crimea. The  commission has started to work.    On 31 May, deputies elected commission chairmen as a  package.  As is known, only one vacant seat, that of the Commission for  Issues of Ecological Policy, remained vacant. Today, Supreme  Council Chairman Oleksandr Moroz proposed that Ivan Zayets  should be elected to this post. But only 156 deputies voted for  this proposal, 13 short of the number required.    Leonid Kuchma made a speech at the plenary sitting. He noted  that the main reason for the crisis in Crimea is that economic  problems were becoming aggravated. In his words, there were no  active anti-Ukrainian and pro-Russian feelings in Crimea two  years ago. Leonid Kuchma sees the solution in really giving  Crimea a special status. He noted: "However, there is a limit  beyond which we cannot go: Crimea should unambiguously be  within the composition of Ukraine."    Oleksandr Moroz stressed that there are objective factors in  the Crimean crisis, i.e. mistakes in the former USSR's policies  and mistakes in resolving the fate of the Black Sea Fleet, and  also subjective factors, i.e. the clash of several nationalisms  in Crimea and the blocking of the creation of a constitutional  court. He proposed that economic relations be unblocked and  that the tourist season in Crimea be allowed to function  normally.</p>

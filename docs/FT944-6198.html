			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Expense exemption lifts employers' burden - Regulation of business including a reduction in business's compliance burdens - was among the proposals outlined by the Inland Revenue. The Revenue said: 'A de minimis exemption for personal incidental expenses paid for by employers is being introduced solely to reduce employers' costs as part of the move to self assessment. The measure will exempt from tax payments up to Pounds 5 (Pounds 10 when abroad) for employees' personal expenses when they stay away from home on business. This is another change that has been proposed in response to a number of representations made by business. 'The proposal to remove the existing income tax charge on employees whose employers pay for their liability insurance or meet their work-related uninsured liabilities such as legal costs will end a reporting requirement to the Inland Revenue as well as sparing employers the complex task of apportionments of premiums between themselves and their employees. There will be similar compliance savings for employers as a result of the revised treatment for replacement beneficial loans announced on November 3. 'The chancellor has also announced further progress on the alignment of NICs and income tax. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary will be issuing further details of this today. 'The Chancellor also confirmed that the Inland Revenue and the Contributions Agency are exploring ways of working more closely together, with a view to providing a better service to employers. The intention will be to remove any unnecessary overlaps at the margins between the departments to ensure that a consistent approach to business can be made. 'The Chancellor also confirmed that the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise have now drawn up plans for closer working between the two revenue departments as anticipated in the government's white paper on competitiveness. 'In drawing up these plans the departments have consulted with business to establish what changes they would like to see made. Two clear messages came through. Business wants: quick and easy access to authoritative and clear advice the revenue departments to detect the non-compliant and uphold the law. 'The closer working plans aim to meet these objectives. They include a range of projects to improve access to information such as shared telephone helplines, along with a freer exchange of information between the two departments (while retaining the same standards of privacy to information received as a result of any such exchanges as they do to information received direct). 'For small employers, the chancellor confirmed that he will raise by Pounds 150 a month the level below which deductions under PAYE and NICs can be paid to Inland Revenue quarterly rather than monthly. 'Ministers have sought to avoid measures which would add to burdens on business. But keeping the tax system up to date has inevitably meant that some new burdens will be imposed. The changes listed below will, however, bring other benefits and the impact on small companies of these various measures will be negligible. Compliance cost assessments have been prepared for the following measures: payments between connected companies: the measure removes some of the perceived harshness of the current rules applying to thinly capitalised companies and amplifies them to provide more certainty. Some companies making payments to connected companies will face a modest increase in compliance costs. Deferral of personal pension annuity purchase: this will give personal pension scheme members increased flexibility in the way they use their personal pension fund and will introduce some new compliance costs for the financial institutions which provide personal pensions and choose to offer the new flexibility. 'The move to self assessment will mean an ongoing reduction in overall compliance costs for businesses generally. This is mainly because of the removal of the cumbersome system of estimated assessments and appeals for the self-employed. 'Compliance cost assessments are normally prepared only where a measure has introduced a new burden on business. But an extensive compliance cost assessment has been prepared for self assessment because the detailed impact of the package will vary between businesses - including, for example, some which may face higher costs because of the new rules for employers who provide benefits in kind. And a change of this nature - representing the biggest change to the administration of direct taxation since PAYE was introduced over 50 years ago - will inevitably bring some transitional costs.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "No Charge"] </F>   [Excerpts] The Royal Government's decision to remove the  security charge levied on local and foreign companies for the  establishment of trade companies and foreign representative  offices here, is a very welcome move. This will give Cambodia an  edge in boosting foreign investments, especially in view of the  fact that the United States embargo on Vietnam has finally been  lifted.    No doubt there will be an expected clamour to invest in the  Indochina region, but the country with the most pull will be the  one which provides the best economic returns for the amount  invested. And Cambodia cannot afford to be seen as lackadaisical  about foreign investment, as the country needs foreign capital  to rebuild the country.    It would be a pity to give up on this opportunity to attract  investment, merely because the government did not act fast  enough. Prior to this move, trading companies and foreign  representative offices had to deposit U.S. $3,000 with the  National Bank as caution money. [passage omitted] Cambodia has a  lot to offer investors but more steps need to be taken to make  life easier for them. If this means cutting down on a lot of  red tape, then so be it.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Analysis of Impacts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximize net benefits (including potential economic,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distributive impacts; and equity). The agency believes that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principles identified in the Executive Order. In addition, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the Executive Order and so is not subject to review under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Description of the Industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 300 iron-containing products that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be affected by these proposed actions, of which approximately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one-half contain 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit. The types  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of iron-containing products that have been associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisonings of young children are products offered in solid oral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dosage form as multi-vitamin/mineral supplements, products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended for use as iron supplements, and drug products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Typically, multi-vitamin/mineral supplements provide less than 30  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mg of iron per dosage unit. Iron supplements and drug products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> typically contain 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed action to require warning statements would affect all iron-containing products. On the other hand, FDA is proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to require unit-dose packaging for products containing 30 mg or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more iron per dosage unit. Therefore, most multi-vitamin/mineral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplements would be subject to the warning statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements but not to the packaging requirements. Most iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplements and iron-containing drug products would be subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both proposed requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Iron-containing products may be purchased by consumers on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their own initiative as dietary supplements, or they may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prescribed by physicians. The information available to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry suggests that the overwhelming majority of iron-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing products are currently packaged in bottles (Ref. 33).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional information suggests that iron-containing products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administered in hospitals are commonly packaged in unit-dose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packaging (Ref. 34). Unit-dose packaging is preferred by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals because with this type of packaging, each dosage unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has an identification and an expiration date, and the hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can continue to use unit-dose packaged drugs rather than having  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to discard a bottle opened for a specific patient after that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patient is discharged. Based on this information, FDA assumes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that iron-containing products dispensed in hospitals are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently packaged in unit-dose packaging.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the National Center for Health Statistics, of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the approximately 169 million persons of age 18 or older, 19.7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent consume iron-containing products (Ref. 35). If it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumed that each individual consumes one dosage unit per day,there are approximately 12 billion dosage units of iron-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing products consumed annually in the United States. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency does not have complete information on the number of dosage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units of iron-containing products that contain 30 mg or more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron. However, because only pregnant women require 30 mg/day,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA assumes that the portion of higher-dosage iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products can be estimated by the number of pregnant women in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States. In 1991, the most recent year for which data are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available, there were 4.1 million live births (Ref. 36). FDA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assuming a one-to-one correspondence between the number of live  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> births and the number of pregnancies in concluding that there are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about 4.1 million pregnant women on any one day in the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States. The number of live births may overestimate the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pregnant women because multiple births by one woman are ignored.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, the number of live births ignores pregnancies not resulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a live birth, which may result in an underestimate of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of pregnant women. If it is assumed that the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> live births is an estimate of the number of dosage units of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products containing 30 mg or more iron, then the number of dosage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units per year can be estimated at 4.1 million times 365 days per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year or about 1.5 billion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

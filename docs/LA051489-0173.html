			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOTH SIDES SAY SCHOOL STRIKE APPEARS SURE;  </P> <P> TEACHERS AND BOARD DEADLOCKED OVER PAY AS MONDAY DEADLINE NEARS  </P> <P> With a strike deadline only a day away, union teachers and the Los Angeles  Unified School District remained deadlocked Saturday on the issue of pay  increases and leaders of both sides said a strike now appears likely.  </P> <P> Wayne Johnson, president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, said the chances of a  strike on Monday now are "99.9%" and that "it would take a minor miracle" to  avert one. School board President Roberta Weintraub said, "I am going to assume  that on Monday morning a strike will occur."  </P> <P> As a result, both sides continued to prepare for a strike. The district signed  on more substitute teachers Saturday, as union picketers angrily shouted  outside. At union headquarters, hundreds of teachers scooped up strike signs  and flyers and huddled over tactics they hope will bring the nation's  second-largest district to a standstill.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Private Meeting  </P> <P> The divided school board held an emotional private meeting for three hours  Saturday, but members were unable to agree on raising the previous pay offer of  a guaranteed 21.5% increase over three years, with the possibility of going to  24% if the district gets more state funds.  </P> <P> The union again rejected that offer, but for the first time said a three-year  agreement would be possible.  </P> <P> Johnson said he would "be very interested in" an offer that would use state  surplus revenues to give teachers a 10% raise retroactive to last July, when  the last contract ended, a guarantee of a 5.5% raise for the coming year, with  a formula to go up to 9% using any state surplus next year, and a further 8%  raise in the third year of a new contract. The previous union demand was for a  21% raise over two years.  </P> <P> A majority of the board is unwilling to gamble a settlement on expectations  that a rise in state revenues could bring the district between $34 million and  $60 million in extra funds, Weintraub said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plans for Cuts  </P> <P> The board has already agreed to cut as much as $120 million from other programs  to fund its latest offer and is divided over whether to make deeper cuts, she  said.  </P> <P> "Fundamentally, the question was whether the board was willing to make those  additional cuts," Weintraub said. "And there are four board members against it  . . . so the board will hold with its present offer." She would not identify  the members.  </P> <P> Negotiators for both sides were in telephone communication through the day but  early morning optimism vanished by evening. Weintraub said that no meeting of  the school board was scheduled for today although members were available if the  situation changed.  </P> <P> Union officials said it would be difficult to call off a strike if there was no  settlement by 6 p.m. today. But they said they would be willing to keep in  contact with district officials.  </P> <P> Johnson characterized as "a con job" the board's offer to stick to 8% for this  year and to apply all state surplus funds to the second year of a contract.  According to the union chief, the non-monetary issues could be settled easily.  </P> <P> "It's the money," he stressed, that is blocking a settlement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Critical of Board  </P> <P> Johnson criticized political divisions within the school board. "The internal  fighting (on the board) is making it more difficult for us to reach a  settlement," he said. And Johnson repeated charges that the existing school  budget, even without the expected state surplus, could afford the pay increases  teachers want.  </P> <P> School board members Julie Korenstein, Warren Furutani and Jackie Goldberg  hurriedly left the private session shortly after lunch, waving off reporters'  questions. Board member Alan Gershman, who left later, said only that "we're  talking."  </P> <P> "They feel very strongly and each member shared their feelings," said district  spokeswoman Diana Munatones of the session. "Each member is agonizing over this  whole process."  </P> <P> Earlier in the week, hopes for a settlement were raised by speculation in  Sacramento that tax revenues would be $750 million higher than expected and  that the Los Angeles school district could get some of that. The board has  agreed to use 60% of that money to raise teachers' salaries above its current  offer.  </P> <P> However, the size of and uses for that surplus are being debated. State  lawmakers may require that much of the extra money be used for only for  textbooks and maintenance, not salaries.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Governor's Plans  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian is expected to announced his revised budget by the end  of the week. A state fact-finder is scheduled to issue a report on the labor  dispute Wednesday.  </P> <P> Weintraub said the board majority concluded that additional state funds "have  to be a certainty" before they will increase the district's offer.  </P> <P> Union Vice President Helen Bernstein said the district could shift other funds  even if the state surplus comes with strings attached. "It's time to take a  risk. It's time to be a little creative," she said Saturday.  </P> <P> Union sources suggested that both sides are seeking face-saving ways to  postpone a strike. One scenario would have teachers delay a strike, even  without a final settlement, if district Supt. Leonard Britton would drop his  demand that teachers turn in student grades on Monday or face withholding of  last month's pay. It was that order that led the union to move the strike date  from May 30 to Monday.  </P> <P> But other people close to the situation said that it is unlikely that the board  would order Britton to reverse his order, even though some board members think  the action was ill-timed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plea to Students  </P> <P> Weintraub urged the district's 595,000 students to attend school Monday. She  said that although the district has not found as many substitutes and  administrators as it needs to maintain regular classes during a strike, "we  will do our best to maintain order and safety in the schools."  </P> <P> Between 500 and 600 people have answered the school system's call for  substitutes, said Michael P. Acosta, a personnel administrator. The district  has about 32,000 teachers, counselors, librarians, nurses and psychologists and  about 17,000 of those voted to strike.  </P> <P> On Saturday, the third day of recruiting substitute teachers, union teachers  set up picket lines outside district headquarters and shouted at people coming  to apply to work as substitute teachers. There were no arrests.  </P> <P> "Scab! Scab! Scab!" two dozen sign-holding teachers shouted at a car crossing  the line.  </P> <P> One teacher boomed out: "About this time Monday, you are going to wish you  hadn't done this. Don't take my job."  </P> <P> Another picketer took pictures as people crossed the line.  </P> <P> Inside, one woman said she was not prepared for the sidewalk confrontation.  "They got kind of nasty," she said. "This was completely unexpected. I had,  like, no time to psych myself out for it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Month of Vacation  </P> <P> Ike Michaels, 27, who said he is a financial analyst, said he was going to take  a month of vacation to teach during the strike in order to keep inner-city  students off the streets. "I'm a strong believer in education and politics  shouldn't be brought into it," he said.  </P> <P> At union headquarters, hundreds of teachers showed up Saturday for pre-strike  planning sessions and to pick up picket signs, flyers, buttons and tee-shirts.  </P> <P> In gearing up for the financial trauma a strike may bring them, teachers  received some good news Saturday. Under threat of a union lawsuit, the district  dropped its threat of stopping payments on health insurance and its demand that  teachers start paying $270 monthly premiums on their own. According to union  president Johnson, federal law requires the district to keep up insurance  coverage for at least 60 days.  </P> <P> One meeting at union headquarters was for the many provisional teachers who are  teaching while earning their state credentials. The district hires more than  1,000 of these instructors each year to help ease its teacher shortage.  However, many feel the strike puts them in a precarious position because they  need good recommendations from administrators to become permanent teachers.  Union leaders urged provisionals to join the picket line, saying any settlement  will include a clause protecting them, as was the case in the agreement ending  the 1970 strike.  </P></p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Cookson in east European venture Cookson, the specialist industrial materials group, is forming a joint venture with Thyssen of Germany to manufacture and supply the central and east European markets with special refractories and systems used in the steel continuous casting process. The joint venture agreement involves Vesuvius International, Cookson's Belgium-based subsidiary and Dolomitwerke Wulfrath, a Thyssen subsidiary. Vesuvius will hold a 75 per cent stake in the new joint venture while Wulfrath will hold the balance. Both partners will inject their shares in their own existing east European joint venture companies - Vesuvius Czechoslovakia Trinec and Ceramika Wulfrath Skawina - into the new company. The local Czech and Polish partners in the existing joint ventures will remain shareholders. Mr Stephen Howard, chief executive in charge of Cookson's group corporate development and chief executive of the Vesuvius division, said the joint venture would enable both Cookson and Thyssen to lessen the risk involved in eastern Europe and to establish a closer working relationship. The central and eastern European markets represent annual steel production of about 170m tons with German production representing about 30 per cent of this. The joint venture will initially have sales of between Pounds 25m and Pounds 30m a year, but turnover and profits are expected to grow quickly as the switch to continuously cast steel production takes place.</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Out of the flying pan and into the fire: BAe's long-awaited restructuring plan has shaken rather than restored confidence in the company Mr John Cahill, British Aerospace's chairman, clearly felt misunderstood yesterday when his company's shares fell out of the sky. His long-awaited announcement of a sweeping restructuring programme at BAe to stop the financial haemorrhaging at Britain's biggest manufacturing company was supposed to restore some confidence. The reality, however, was starkly different. The City of London was unimpressed by the package and remains unconvinced that Mr Cahill and his top management team have found the key to secure the company's future. Mr Cahill, however, put on a brave face. He said he had bought his shares in the company at 357p. 'I'm going to hang on and buy some more,' he added, as the share price fell 43 per cent to close yesterday at 113p. The shares have been in free fall since BAe became engulfed in a management crisis and launched a controversial Pounds 432m rights issue a year ago. Mr Cahill was brought in as chairman last May to oversee a new strategy for the group and its activities, which range from defence and commercial aircraft to Rover cars and property. But the steps announced by Mr Cahill yesterday - including a Pounds 750m write-off for the restructuring costs of the company's loss-making regional jet business; the closure of the Hatfield aircraft manufacturing plant; the loss of another 3,000 jobs; a preliminary agreement to form a regional jet joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace; and the concentration of turbopropeller aircraft production at Prestwick in Scotland - failed to lift the question-marks still hanging over the future of BAe. Put simply, the fundamental problems facing BAe have not changed in the past 12 months. If anything, they have become worse, judging by the pre-tax loss of Pounds 129m the company reported for the first six months of this year compared with a profit of Pounds 86m in the first half of last year. The recession and defence spending cuts have put all of the company's business activities under increasing pressure. Defence continues to be the main profit centre with Pounds 296m profits in the first half on sales of Pounds 2bn. But the question is whether this profitability can be maintained in the longer term in a declining market. BAe hopes to win another big order for military aircraft from Saudi Arabia soon to help underpin its defence business. But it also faces growing doubts over the future of the European Fighter Aircraft in which it is the main UK partner. Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, suggested yesterday that BAe could 'go it alone' on EFA if the Germans and the other European partners in the project, Italy and Spain, pulled out. However, many in the industry believe any future combat aircraft project is unlikely to fly without international collaboration. In contrast to the profitable defence business, BAe's commercial aircraft activities have become a financial black hole. 'For every one pound made by the military division, the civil aircraft division loses 96p,' the company says. The commercial aircraft operations lost Pounds 286m in the first half of this year compared with a loss of Pounds 32m the previous year. The losses have largely come from BAe's regional and commuter aircraft activities. Although it lost Pounds 4m on its activities in the European Airbus programme in the first half, BAe sees its 20 per cent participation in Airbus as one of its most promising long-term assets now that Airbus has captured 30 per cent of the market for large airliners. Mr Cahill's first big move has been to tackle BAe's regional airline activities. The company considered many options, including shutting down the entire regional aircraft operations, maintaining the status quo, or seeking a joint venture partner. By taking a Pounds 750m write-off to cover its regional jet operations, BAe has prepared itself for the worst. But it still hopes to remain an important player in the regional jet market by forging a joint venture partnership with Taiwan Aerospace. Such a partnership could help BAe challenge the European regional aircraft consortium now being put together by Deutsche Aerospace of Germany and Fokker of the Netherlands. BAe appears optimistic it will complete its Taiwan deal by the end of this year. This would see the two partners investing Dollars 250m each in the venture to build the family of BAe 146 regional jets launched by the company earlier this year. But the regional aircraft market continues to suffer from acute overcapacity and competition is likely to remain intense. The deal struck with Taiwan is still no more than an agreement in principle. The US McDonnell Douglas company negotiated a similar deal with Taiwan Aerospace last year which has so far produced no concrete results. The decision to concentrate all BAe's turbopropeller aircraft activities at Prestwick is designed to improve the productivity of these loss-making operations. In the longer term, BAe may also be forced to seek a partner to strengthen these activities. It tried to do so with its corporate jets when it announced in May that a majority stake in this business was up for sale. Yesterday BAe confirmed it would retain this activity. The fact the company failed to find a buyer prepared to make a sufficiently attractive offer for its corporate jet division did little to improve City sentiments. The Rover car activities continue to be plagued by the depressed state of the UK market, and there are few signs of recovery. Rover, which reduced its first-half losses to Pounds 31m from Pounds 43m last year, has been turned into a much more efficient manufacturer during the past two years, helped by its partnership with Honda of Japan. The immediate issue is whether the UK car market can recover to the point where Rover can start to make money. BAe also expects its property assets, totalling about 13,000 acres of prime sites in the UK, to generate cash when recovery occurs. Although they are both struggling, Rover and the property business appear far less of an immediate problem for BAe than its debacle in the commercial aircraft sector. Mr Cahill and his team believe they have now taken a significant step towards resolving the company's commercial aircraft difficulties. The joint venture with Taiwan would protect jobs in the UK and ensure the country's presence in the regional jet market, Mr Cahill said, adding that his strategy was 'evolutionary rather than revolutionary'. By its reaction yesterday, the market was looking for revolution. One could soon be in the offing. With its share price plunging, the City was again rife with rumours of a possible GEC bid for BAe.</p>

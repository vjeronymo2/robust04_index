			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Coutts Consulting dispute continues THE DISPUTE between Coutts Consulting, formerly DC Gardner, and Mr Barry Topple, its former chief executive, is showing no signs of reaching a conclusion. Yesterday Sir Kit McMahon, chairman, sent a letter to all shareholders saying that the career consultancy, outplacement and residential training group would make no further improvement to the conversion terms for the convertible preference shares. He added that Coutts would not sell Eynsham Hall, a residential training centre, for which Mr Topple has made an offer and is keen to buy; that it was defending Mr Topple's claim against the company over compensation for the termination of his employment last year; and that it was pursuing its counter-claim against him for damages for Pounds 3.4m. When contacted in Australia, Mr Topple declined to comment. Coutts has one piece of its lengthy restructuring left to achieve - the reduction of the share premium account, so that ordinary dividend payments can recommence. The move was blocked on July 5 by holders of the convertible preference shares, of which Mr Topple owns 50 per cent and is a trustee for a further 20 per cent. Agreement from 75 per cent of holders was necessary. The board offered improved conversion terms - 66.67 ordinary for every 100 convertible preference, up about 40 per cent from the existing 47.62 - but in his letter Sir Kit said that the offer closed on August 6 with no acceptances. In its results for the six months to June 30, released yesterday, Coutts made pre-tax losses of Pounds 5.24m, against profits of Pounds 930,000 last time. The figure was distorted by exceptional costs of Pounds 5.29m, relating to the sale of the banking and management training division to Euromoney Publications for Pounds 3.7m and the termination of a lease on a Docklands property in June. Operating profits declined to Pounds 329,000 (Pounds 1.28m), with continuing activities contributing Pounds 1.13m (Pounds 1.35m), though a Pounds 200,000 write-down in the carrying value of a property for sale and Pounds 228,000 (Pounds 96,000) for redundancies and reorganisation were subtracted. Group turnover grew to Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 10.2m), with ongoing businesses higher at Pounds 9.42m (Pounds 7.46m).</p>

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / The European Market: Political worries fail to deter western investors - Companies are flocking to get brands established before their competitors WESTERN multinational companies are maintaining the momentum of investment in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, in spite of increasing political anxieties in several countries. That is the main message emerging from a survey* carried out by Creditanstalt, the Austrian Bank, and Business International (now part of the Economist Intelligence Unit). More than half of investor respondents - 54 per cent - report they are increasing investments in the east European region. However, 17 per cent are lowering their initial investment levels, above all in the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. The main reasons for caution are economic and political uncertainties, as well as difficulties surrounding the legal systems in the former communist states. Western businesses moving into eastern Europe are motivated above all by desire to establish market share and gain low-cost production sites. 'Investors are flocking to eastern Europe to get their brands firmly entrenched ahead of their competitors,' according to Mr Rene Gatling, author of the study. The review of 87 companies which have invested in eastern Europe or which are considering this step shows the former Soviet Union is considered the most difficult area for establishing a foothold. 'Cultural differences' with the west are cited as a particular reason for difficulties. 'For many western companies, taking the plunge into the Soviet market is a major risk,' says Mr Gatling. However, 52 per cent of respondents say they are still considering investments in the ex-Soviet republics, with only 22 per cent ruling this out for the moment. A majority of corporations - 57 per cent - believe Hungary has the easiest investment procedures, because of its longer track record of openness to western companies. Hungary has attracted the bulk of capital investment and about 50 per cent of acquisitions so far in the region. The country is estimated to have attracted more than Dollars 4bn in western working capital. The report points out that investors have varying perceptions of risk in eastern Europe. US companies, for instance, pay hardly any attention to potential problems posed by Hungary's political environment. Austrian and German investors, however, see political risk as fifth in their list of preoccupations about starting up there. On the other hand, US investors appear much more worried than Austrian/German companies about the political environment in Czechoslovakia. US investors are also much more averse than companies from Austria and Germany to giving employment guarantees to accompany their investment moves. This reflects the relatively generous labour and employment protection laws already in force in Austria and Germany. *Creditanstalt/EIU Vienna 1992 East European Investment Survey.

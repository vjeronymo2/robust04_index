			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>   [Text] Geneva, 12 Jan -- The prospects for a full-scale  political settlement in Abkhazia are the main topic of  discussion at the Georgian-Abkhaz talks here. They have been  organized under the aegis of the UN with Russia's assistance.  The possibility of concluding an agreement is being discussed,  reflecting the key areas of a settlement, especially the  resolution of the problem of refugees and the future political  status of Abkhazia.    The Georgian delegation is headed by Jaba Ioseliani,  chairman  of the Provisional Committee for the State of Emergency. The  Abkhaz delegation is headed by Sokrat Dzhindzholiya, chairman of  Abkhazia's Council of Ministers. Taking part in the  consultations are special representative of the UN Secretary  General Edouard Brunner and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister  Boris Pastukhov.    Mikhail Ukleba, Georgian deputy foreign minister and member  of the Georgian delegation, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent  that several draft agreements presented by the delegations have  been submitted for examination. The participants are also  discussing the proposals of the Russian delegation and the  Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, OHCR, on the  return of the refugees to Abkhazia. M. Ukleba said that on the  first day of the talks, 11 January, it was decided that on 8  February a group of experts, which is engaged in drawing up  proposals on the political status of Abkhazia, would meet again  in Moscow. The first sitting of this group took place in Moscow  on 15-16 December.    In a conversation with the ITAR-TASS correspondent, S.  Dzhindzholiya said: "The main question is strengthening peace.  We therefore propose the creation of a disengagement corridor  along the Inguri river and and the introduction of peacekeeping  forces there. We say -- and the Georgian side agrees with this  -- that Russian troops could fulfill the role of peacekeeping  forces." The second issue of the talks, the political status of  Abkhazia, "is so complicated that it is impossible to expect any  decision to be taken today." Its discussion will be continued  by experts in Moscow.    S. Dzhindzholiya said the participants in the round are  devoting a great deal of attention to the problem of refugees.  It is not ruled out that as a first step, recommendations will  be drawn up for the return of the refugees to one area of  Abkhazia. It is intended that discussions on this matter will  be continued in Moscow in February by the representatives of the  sides within the framework of the working group with the  participation of OHCR specialists.</p>

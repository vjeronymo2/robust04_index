			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 7 (XINHUA) -- China has made  substantial progress in construction of the "pillar industries",  which have been designated to promote a high-speed, steady and  healthy economic development.    In the beginning of the 1990s, the Chinese Government worked  out a plan to vitalize the industries of machinery, electronics,  petrochemical industry, automobile and construction, and  gradually make them pillar industries capable of driving the  development of the whole economy.    Sources from related departments show that in the past few  years, these industries have generally maintained fairly high  development speed, with their output value constituting a  considerable part in the gross national product. They have also  made significant breakthroughs in technical advancement, scale  economy and some other aspects.    An official from the Ministry of Machinery said that in 1993  the machinery industry finished a total output value of 360  billion yuan, an increase of 24 percent over the previous year.    The output of mechanical equipment needed by the state's key  construction projects has been largely increased, the research  of key technical equipment has made smooth progress, such as the  home- made 300,000-kw and 600,000-kw thermo power generating  units, the cold and heat continuous rolling mills and blast  furnace of the second-phase project of Baoshan Iron and Steel  Company, which have reached the internationally advanced level.    The country's electronics industry has begun its effort to  organize large enterprise groups, in a bid to develop new and  high- tech products with joint investment. In this aspect the  ministry has already experienced success in building "Hualu" --  an ambitious video-corder production base, of which the  first-phase project, capable of producing 1.5 million sets of  key parts, became operational at the end of last year.    So far, computers have been used in more than 20 industries  including banking, railways, civil aviation, building materials,  metallurgy, commerce and tourism, and the number of computers  being used has exceeded 1.5 million.    China's auto industry has been taking shape in recent years,  with construction of the state's eight key production bases  going smoothly and the output capacity rising fast. In 1993 the  country's total auto output reached 1.28 million, up 20 percent  from the previous year.    The auto industry has introduced more than 200 items of  technology in recent years, while at the same time making active  efforts to increase the proportion of home-made parts. To date  the proportion of home-made parts in "Santana" produced in  Shanghai has exceeded 80 percent, while that of "Cherokee Jeep"  in Beijing, "Peugeot" in Guangzhou and "Xiali (Charade)" in  Tianjin have all exceeded 50 percent.    As a result of improved quality, some China-made auto parts  have already been exported.    To make sure that the plan of "pillar industries"  construction be fulfilled, the related ministries have all  drafted special industrial policies to define the key points to  be developed.    For machinery industry, the key points are complete sets of  equipment for transportation and energy, and basic machinery  parts; for the electronics industry, they are integrated  circuits, computers, telecommunications equipment and modern  domestic appliances.    The key parts for the construction industry are residential  houses, public facilities and industrial buildings, while that  for the auto industry are sedan cars, light trucks and auto  parts.</p>

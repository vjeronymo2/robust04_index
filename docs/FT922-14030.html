			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: P&amp;O and CDC sell container stake CHINA MERCHANTS, one of Beijing's biggest companies operating in Hong Kong, yesterday agreed to pay Pounds 100m (Dollars 170m) for a 15 per cent interest in Modern Terminals (MTL), from the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company and Commonwealth Development Corporation. The share of MTL will give China Merchants a stake in Hong Kong's second largest container operator and a front seat in bidding for the construction and operation of the colony's proposed ninth container terminal. P&amp;O sold 8.1 per cent of its 23 per cent stake in MTL for Pounds 55m (Dollars 95.7m), realising a profit of Pounds 49m on book value. CDC, a UK government financial institution which invested Pounds 2m in 6.9 per cent of MTL in 1975, walks away with Pounds 45m. P&amp;O will retain 14.9 per cent of MTL. The capital released from the sale will allow it to expand in the region. MTL's other shareholders are Wharf, which owns 25.6 per cent, and Swire, which has 13 per cent.</p>

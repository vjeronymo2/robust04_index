			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> DEFENSE KEYS OCEAN VIEW'S 52-38 VICTORY  </P> <P> Ocean View High School forced Huntington Beach to try something new Saturday --  outside shooting.  </P> <P> The Seahawks went to a 2-3 zone, halting the Oilers' inside game and limiting  them to nine field goals in a 52-38 Sunset League victory before a capacity  crowd at Ocean View.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach (11-10, 7-2) made nine of 53 shots (17%) and didn't score from  the field until almost two minutes into the second quarter.  </P> <P> Ocean View (16-6, 6-2) kept the ball away from Jeff Long, who usually goes  inside for easy layups.  </P> <P> "Huntington Beach is excellent inside with their short baskets," Ocean View  Coach Jim Harris said. "The idea was to not let that happen."  </P> <P> Ocean View took a quick 12-3 lead in the first quarter, but at halftime, the  Seahawks' lead was cut to two points, 23-21, thanks to the Oilers' 11 of 14  free throw shooting.  </P> <P> But Ocean View opened up a lead in the third quarter and coasted to the victory  in the fourth.  </P> <P> "We just didn't put the ball in the basket," Huntington Beach Coach Roy Miller  said. "I've never had a team shoot that cold.  </P> <P> "I don't know whether to attribute it to their defense or the fact that  everyone decided to be cold.  </P> <P> "I told the team that the pressure was on Ocean View. I told them to relax and  have fun. But I was surprised at how tight we were."  </P> <P> Ocean View didn't have a great shooting day either, connecting on 18 of 46  attempts for 39%.  </P> <P> But the Seahawks dominated the boards and got steady performances from Darren  Ernst (11 points, 16 rebounds) and Greg Evans (game-high 15 points).  </P> <P> Joey Kijewski led Huntington Beach with 11 points.  </P> <P> LARRY NISTA  </P> <P> Edison 48, Marina 46 -- Steve Thobe sank two free throws with 30 seconds left  to put the Chargers up by six points as Edison (12-12, 5-3) withstood a late  rally by Marina (2-6 in league play). Sean Hafelrig of Marina led all scorers  with 13 points.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley 66, Westminster 40 -- Mike Cook scored 15 points and pulled in  10 rebounds to lead visiting Fountain Valley (17-5, 5-3). Don Shaw was  Westminster's leading scorer with 14.  </P> <P> In Olympic League boys' basketball:  </P> <P> Orange Lutheran 83, Valley Christian 78 -- Pat Bagatourian led host Orange  Lutheran (19-3, 12-0) with 30 points and teammate Daryl Cole added 24. Mike  Blackstead was the leading scorer for Valley Christian (7-5, 16-6).  </P> <P> Whittier Christian 99, Whitney 70 -- Whittier Christian had everybody score in  a romp over Whitney at Sonora High School. Matt Riehm led the way with 27  points and Paul McKinley added 21. Whittier Christian is 16-6, 9-3. Whitney  (1-10 in league play) was led by Adrian Keller with 17 points.  </P> <P> Ontario Christian 76, Capistrano Valley Christian 60 -- Jason Rodarmel led  Capistrano Valley Christian (5-16, 2-10) with 15 points but it was not enough  as the Eagles lost at home.  </P> <P> Brethren 55, Santa Margarita 50 -- Dan Bathey led Santa Margarita (7-14, 2-10)  with 18 points.  </P></p>

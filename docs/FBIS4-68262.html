			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Maryukha: "`Third Repartition': Will It </F> Clear Up the Fate of the Black Sea Fleet?"]    [Text] The striving of the Ukrainian side to divide the  Black Sea Fleet on an individual basis and thereby to "bury" it  as an operational-strategic formation covering the southern  flanks of Russia and Ukraine has already become an unfortunate  tradition. The agreements signed by the leaders of the two  countries in Yalta, Dagomys, Zavidovo, and Massandra, which  alleviated some accumulated tension, only temporarily cooled the  zeal of the Ukrainian military, who intended to have a "perhaps  small but their own" fleet by confiscating the property of  Russia. The fact that the Black Sea Fleet with all of its  infrastructure is really Russian can be seen convincingly not  only in the Massandra protocol but also in its exclusive Russian  financing since September of last year.    Last Friday, after a meeting of the heads of state of the  CIS, presidents Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk also drew a  line under the latest attempt at a unilateral division of the  Black Sea Fleet begun by the Ukrainian special forces in Odessa.  An agreement was signed on the staged settlement of the problem  of the Black Sea Fleet, which contains three basic directions.  The document states that the Ukrainian Naval Forces and the  Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation will be based  separately and the Ukrainian side gets 15 to 20 percent of the  Fleet's ships. It is planned to prepare an agreement on the  parameters of such a division within 10 days.    It was essentially a matter of the first Russian proposals  on  the division of the property of the former Union and the  allocation to Ukraine of those ships and units of the Black Sea  Fleet whose presence is adequate to resolve the tasks in the  protection of the naval boundaries of the sovereign state.    On Saturday, however, a statement by Vyacheslav Kostikov,  press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation, was  disseminated that stressed that once again the Russian side was  forced to remind people of the hard reality that was the basis  of the joint document of the two presidents: "Unweighed words  and actions are inappropriate when it is a matter of something  that is sacred to the nation, as is the Black Sea Fleet." Is it  appropriate to remind people that none of the sides must put  into doubt the sincerity of the negotiating process? It turns  out that it is.    Figuratively speaking, the ink had not yet dried on the  signed agreement when the first alarming reports were received  from Izmail, Ochakov, and Nikolayev on the violation of the  spirit and the letter of the indicated document by the Ukrainian  side. It is there where the Western Naval Region of the  Ukrainian Naval Forces is being organized and its Chief, Capt  1st Rank Dmitriy Ukrainetz decided "to grow into the situation  in advance." A Ukrainian brigade commander--Capt. 1st Rank  Yaroslav Fedorishin--has already been assigned to a brigade of  river craft of the Black Sea Fleet in Izmail and the seamen have  been promised high pay for swearing allegiance to Ukraine,  whereas the rest will be forced to leave the boundaries of the  republic. Ukraine has begun the systematic and unilateral  seizure of Fleet property even before a mechanism is worked out  for the division of the Black Sea Fleet as set forth by the  agreement. Meanwhile, Kiev is already spreading its own  interprepations of the signed document with respect to the time  for which bases are leased and the places where the Black Sea  Fleet will be stationed.    The times specified by the agreement for the separation of  the bases to avoid conflicts between the Black Sea Fleet and the  Ukrainian Naval Forces are extremely rigid, something that was  not in the previous documents that left the resolution of the  problem to the distant future. But the mechanism for a new  "watershed" may "break down" again and again because of the  unilateral actions of the Ukrainian military people,  complicating the relations of the two sides. Still, one would  like to believe that the time of ultimatums with which the  Ukrainian Ministry of Defense entered the territory of Russian  military units under the cover of the assault rifles of special  forces has passed. There is a document guaranteeing this and  cemented by the signatures of the leaders of the two neighboring  friendly countries, and there is still a whole week remaining  for the achievement of a common point of view at the level of  experts and working groups on the division of the Black Sea  Fleet. The purpose is to accurately carry out the achieved  agreements in the localities. This must be clear, above all, to  the Ukrainian military people, who are presently not called upon  to show any "initiative" in the interpretation of the agreement  signed by their commander-in-chief.</p>

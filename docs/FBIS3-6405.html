			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [By reporter Yi Tong-kuk] </F>   [Text] Several things decide the image of the prime  minister: the degree of public confidence in the president, the  prime minister's personal power, and his ability to get control  of and coordinate ministry operations. Of these, the ability to  get control of and coordinate operations is the standard of  measure showing a prime minister's working ability. How, then,  does Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang score on this test?    "I will get control of the Cabinet through work." This has  been the pledge and regular recipe of successive prime ministers  early after being appointed. However, with the vague image of  the prime minister in a president-centered system, this has  almost never been achieved properly due to the lack of  cooperation of the ministries.    Recently, Prime Minster Yi has been exercising actual  coordination authority, which had practically been unheard of,  over ministry operations and has been breaking long-standing  practices. Some ministries, such as finance and construction,  had decided on and published policies without properly going  through preliminary deliberations with the Prime Minister's  Office and suffered more than a little for it. Prime Minister  Yi's use of his coordination authority has been to unsheathe his  "sword" and turn ministries inside out. He even issued warning  summons to relevant ministers. Going one step further, Yi  greatly strengthened the policy-evaluation team within the Prime  Minister's Office.    Actually, it is a fact that up until only a little while  ago,  each ministry considered the Prime Minister's Office simply a  place to give notice before reporting to the Blue House. This  practice was particularly serious in the economic ministries,  reports from which first pass through a meeting of economic  ministers and vice-ministers. In view of this, the recent  readjustment of items announced by the economic ministries under  the management of the Prime Minister's Office signifies much.  From a certain viewpoint, this can be seen as the realization of  Yi's conviction that he should "guarantee the maximum autonomy  of the ministries in the preparation and performance of policy,  but definitely exercise his supervisory role in coordinating  divergent views, and so on."    Decided upon upon on 24 January, the "Farm and Fishing  Village Special Tax Assessment Proposal" was originally proposed  by the Finance Ministry, but was changed extensively by the  Prime Minister's Office before being announced. Before this, on  the 21st, "according to standard practice," the Finance Ministry  prepared a revenue-source procurement proposal and made it  public without consulting the Prime Minister's Office  beforehand. This was because a "powerful" ministry such as the  Finance Ministry has no need to concern itself with the  displeasure of the Prime Minister's Office and because there had  been no previous instance of the Prime Minister's Office  interfering in the peculiar operations of the Ministry of  Finance.    The situation, however, changed at the instruction of Prime  Minister Yi. Because there were problems with the Finance  Ministry's proposal, such as that the Farm and Fishing Village  Special Tax would be a great burden on those in low-income  brackets, it was ordered that the Prime Minister's Office review  the proposal. Changing the proposal and aiming for those in  high-income brackets, the Prime Minister's Office created a  revised proposal whereby the wealthy would pay the Farm and  Fishing Village Special Tax, as well as a golf-course entrance  fee and an integrated land tax, but would not impose these taxes  on companies moving to rural areas and those in low-income  brackets. Afterward, at an unscheduled meeting of the heads of  relevant government ministries, departments, offices, and  bureaus, held on the instructions of Prime Minister Yi, the  already-published Finance Ministry proposal was repealed and the  Prime Minister's Office's revised proposal was adopted.    "The operations of the economic ministries in fact had  extraterritorial rights within the Prime Minister's Office,"  according to the evaluation of one source associated with the  Prime Minister's Office, "There had not been a case such as this  one, in which the Prime Minister's Office intervened and changed  a Finance Ministry proposal."    Another case in which with similar form Prime Minister Yi  exercised his operation-coordination authority was the Ministry  of Construction's "Capital Maintenance Plan Law, Enforcement  Ordinance Revision Proposal." This proposal, about which  preliminary notice had been given that it would be introduced as  a legislative bill, changed capital development strategy 180  degrees, such as allowing the construction of large buildings  anywhere in Seoul if only 10 percent of the construction costs  are paid in advance.    The Ministry of Construction on 25 January held  party-government consultations and unilaterally announced the  proposal without going through preliminary deliberations with  the Prime Minister's Office or even informing the office of the  content of the proposal. Considering this a problem, Prime  Minister Yi in his weekly report on the 28th reported to  President Kim Yong-sam on the problem of the decisionmaking  process of the Construction Ministry's proposal. He also had his  office come up with supplementary measures.    In connection with this, President Kim, in his weekly  chief-secretaries meeting held on this day in the afternoon,  said concerning the construction ministry proposal, "We must not  have an immoderate removal of regulations." On the 29th, Prime  Minister Yi even called Construction Minister Kim U-sok and  received a progress report. In this process, Yi sent a directive  to each of the ministries, giving strict orders, "Plans which  are to become legislative bills must pass through  interministerial deliberations, but a preliminary report must be  made on everything two days prior to publication."    Besides this, the Prime Minister's Office's unprecedented,  active exercise of its operation-coordination authority has also  been seen in almost all policies, such as the Water-Quality  Management Measures, since Prime Minister Yi took office.    With one section responsible for this, it was no more than a  formality. However, Prime Minister Yi expanded the  policy-evaluation function of the Prime Minster's Office to four  sections, making his control of the ministries more concrete.  "The administration has made many policies, but there is no  place to appropriately evaluate these," said Yi on the 31st,  revealing his reasons for strengthening his policy team.  Evaluation results are reported directly to President Kim.</p>

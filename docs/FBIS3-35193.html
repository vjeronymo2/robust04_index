			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Latif al-Tayyib] </F>   [Text] The Interior Ministry emphasized that some Arab and  foreign quarters are involved in smuggling sheep and certain  items of state property out of Iraq.    Staff General 'Abd-al-Jawad Dhanun, the ministry's senior  undersecretary, said that specialized authorities in the Iraqi  border posts caught large numbers of sheep set to be smuggled  abroad. He said the sheep are smuggled to Jordan first as a  transit point, and then are smuggled to the agent Saudi regime,  which is trying, through various means, to undermine the Iraqi  economy. The second destination of smuggling is the Autonomous  Region.    He added that a number of criminals steal state property and  private vehicles, in collusion with the Iranian regime, which  hates the Iraqi people, to smuggle the property and vehicles to  Iran through various channels.    He said that, through their sabotage actions, the Saudi and  Iranian regimes have proven once again their direct involvement  in the imperialist-Zionist scheme led by the United States and  Zionism with the aim of undermining Iraq's capabilities and  weakening its steadfastness in face of the unjust siege imposed  on our steadfast people. These two regimes want to increase the  suffering of the people of Iraq.    He added that the Saudi agent regime concentrates on female  sheep in a dirty attempt to reduce the number of these animals,  which are important to Iraq's national economy. This scheme has  increased the meat prices in all governorates despite the fact  that the Interior Ministry allows the movement of sheep between  governorates, except these near the borders, in order to secure  red meat. The free movement of sheep is also designed to help  secure a balance in the availability of meat in all governorates  in accordance with their population, and with special emphasis  on Baghdad Governorate because a huge number of people live in  the capital in comparison with other governorates.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / UK Company News: SB blames Wall Street as shares fall 17p SHARES IN SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals and household products company, continued to fall yesterday despite its announcement of better-than-expected first quarter results. The shares fell 17p to 799p, from 872p at the start of the week, as US investors continued to sell healthcare stocks. 'The fall is not a reaction to the results, it's Wall Street,' said Mr James Culverwell of Hoare Govett. SB reported a 10 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 278m in the three months to March 31. Mr Robert Bauman, chief executive, said the company maintained its momentum of 1991, when profits exceeded Pounds 1bn for the first time, and most divisions performed well in the first quarter. The first interim dividend is lifted by 10.7 per cent to 4.15p (3.75p) for the A shares, and by some 13 per cent to 48.77 cents (43.09 cents) per equity unit, stock issued to SmithKline Beckman's US shareholders during the 1989 merger with Beecham. The difference between the dividend growth is due to exchange translation rates. Turnover increased by 9 per cent to Pounds 1.21bn while trading profit improved 8 per cent to Pounds 289m. Currency movements lifted sales 4 per cent but depressed profits 2 per cent. Trading profits from pharmaceuticals were 10 per cent higher at Pounds 218m. The antibiotic Augmentin performed well in Europe, although US sales declined. Tagamet, a peptic ulcer treatment, increased worldwide sales by 2 per cent. Havrix, marketed as the world's first Hepatitis A vaccine, has been introduced in the UK, Switzerland and Belgium but it is too early to assess its success. The consumer brands division maintained profits at Pounds 44m, although turnover increased by 5 per cent to Pounds 322m. Tums, the indigestion treatment, and Aquafresh toothpaste lifted sales 14 per cent and 15 per cent respectively. The clinical laboratories division increased trading profits 27 per cent to Pounds 14m, while animal health products were affected by recession and saw a 7 per cent decline to Pounds 13m. Interest charges fell to Pounds 12m (Pounds 15m). The company used a net cash inflow of Pounds 106m to reduce borrowings by Pounds 48m to Pounds 454m. Earnings increased to 13.5p per A share and 67.5p per equity unit.</p>

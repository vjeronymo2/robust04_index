			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Lib Dems propose jobless voucher scheme Employers should be paid up to Pounds 150 a week to give jobs to the long-term unemployed, says a policy paper to be published by the Liberal Democrats later this week. The paper, drawn up by leading party figures including Baroness Williams, a founding member of the former Social Democratic party, also calls for a 2 per cent payroll levy on companies to finance an increase in training. The paper will be debated at the party's annual conference next month. It says that social security benefits payable to people unemployed for more than six months should be converted into vouchers payable to employers, with a maximum value of Pounds 150 a week. The value of the vouchers would be reduced by Pounds 1.50 for each week of employment, avoiding an open-ended commitment by the taxpayer. Employers would have to pay wages at least equal to the value of the voucher. Companies would be eligible only if the employees hired were genuine additions to the workforce, to avoid the displacement of existing workers. Companies would be required to provide training. The paper concedes that 'careful monitoring' would be required to prevent abuses by unscrupulous employers. But it says tax revenue would be boosted. The average benefit to the Exchequer is estimated at Pounds 23 a week. The paper says: 'Even if some displacement of existing workers were to occur, the restoration of hope, confidence and working capacity to individuals who would otherwise be almost permanently excluded from the workforce makes it worthwhile.' The proposal goes much further than Workstart, a similar pilot scheme launched by the government last year. The paper says that the training levy would encourage a big increase in company training schemes. All or part of the levy would be repaid to companies offering approved schemes, and the net proceeds would be distributed to local authorities and to training and enterprise councils, the bodies which administer government training schemes in England and Wales.</p>

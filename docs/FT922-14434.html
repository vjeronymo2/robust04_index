			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Poor pushed to back of queue - The Issues: Poverty HOW WILL Pilton vote? The question is of unusual interest to the political parties this year. This is because the electors of this deprived cluster of Edinburgh estates are being wooed by both official and deselected Labour candidates, casting uncertainty over the party's 11,327 majority in the city's Leith constit uency. There are, however, bigger questions, most notably how many people living in Pilton's more rundown blocks and terraces will bother to vote at all. A striking economic phenomenon of the 1980s was a growing disparity in income and wealth between the richest and poorest sections of the population. This widening division has been accompanied by discussion about whether Britain is witnessing, in its inner cities and peripheral estates, the emergence of a social group which is outside the norms and values of mainstream society. Pilton is one of four UK areas involved in Poverty 3, a European Community anti-poverty programme. An EC profile of Pilton provides a composite picture typical of many of Britain's less-advantaged communities. Unemployment is double the Edinburgh average; only about a third of the workforce have full-time jobs; half of those without jobs are long-term unemployed; between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of the population rely on state benefits for all or part of their income. In addition, the proportion of children qualifying for free school meals in the area's nine primary schools ranges from 31 per cent to 91 per cent. A majority of children receive free meals in all except two schools. Drug abuse is extensive, and health problems and premature death are far more prevalent than in areas with greater advantages. Yet Pilton is not defeatist about its difficulties. One evening last week, about 60 people attended one of the local forum meetings through which Edinburgh District Council is trying to improve community contact. Most items on the agenda would be unrecognisable as concerns to the inhabitants of suburbia, but they read like an action-list of imperatives in places such as Pilton: efforts to improve council service-standards so that problems are dealt with within 14 days; setting up a council office in Pilton so that residents do not have to travel into central Edinburgh to discuss problems; racial harassment; the closure of the accident and emergency unit at the local hospital, forcing people without cars to take children to the city centre. The debate is vigorous and articulate, because many of those present are politically active or involved in community organisations. They are a minority. Some 35,000 people live in the Pilton EC project area and most would never attend such a meeting. Some 'just sit at home demoralised by unemployment and poverty', one person says. Do the people who are relatively disadvantaged actually regard themselves as in poverty? Mr John Mulvey, director of the EC project in Pilton, says: 'People tend not to like the term because of widespread implications that poverty is somehow the fault of the individual.' The scheme's title, Pilton Poverty Programme, was disliked by local people and is now underplayed in favour of the Pilton Partnership Project. Also people who understandably resent being labelled 'poor' shudder at the imported US term 'underclass', now part of the sociological vocabulary in Britain. It is used to describe those that fit no conventional class category and are detached from mainstream values. Sir Ralf Dahrendorf, the warden of St Antony's College, Oxford, has written of the underclass as the 'living doubt in the prevailing values which will eat into the texture of the societies in which we are living'. There is not universal agreement that an underclass - as opposed to deprived people - actually exists. Research published this month by the independent Policy Studies Institute estimates that the underclass doubled from about 2m in 1979 to 4m in 1986, but this was based on a tight definition confined to families which are excluded from paid work. Applying this definition, only 68 per cent of the underclass voted in the 1987 general election, compared with 82 per cent of the employed. This year's voting patterns will be studied for evidence that people who are relatively disadvantaged may have become further alienated from the mainstream of society. The question of whether a permanent underclass is emerging is not only a matter for academic study. The existence of such a group, millions strong, whose members feel little attachment to society could have alarming implications and become a leading election issue by the turn of the century. In the present election, however, poverty is not central to the campaign. The Child Poverty Action Group's pre-election analysis of the three main programmes concludes that 'in the 50th anniversary year of the Beveridge report we need a more fundamental commitment to preventing poverty - not merely patching it up - and to the redistribution of resources than any of the three main parties' manifestos is currently offering'.</p>

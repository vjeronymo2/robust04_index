			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO CONSIDER FIREWORKS MEASURE  </P> <P> The City Council today will consider whether to place on the ballot a measure  that would ban the sale and use of fireworks.  </P> <P> It would be the second time Fullerton has considered a fireworks ban.  </P> <P> In October, the council voted 3 to 2 against the idea, despite the Fire  Department's recommendation.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Molly McClanahan, who along with Councilman Don Bankhead voted for  the ban on so-called "safe and sane" fireworks, said she is not certain how she  will vote this time.  </P> <P> "I think some decisions should be made by the City Council," McClanahan said.  "I don't think we should run to the voters every time a decision has to be  made. That's what we're here for."  </P> <P> Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin and council members Chris Norby and Richard C.  Ackerman previously voted not to ban fireworks.  </P> <P> Catlin, who will be attending his first council meeting since his June 20  body-surfing accident, said he is undecided on the issue. Although he was  impressed by the city's fireworks show last month -- intended to discourage  private use of fireworks -- "I also want to emphasize the need to be careful  about destroying tradition."  </P> <P> Ackerman, who opposes any fireworks ban, said, "All I know is that no one has  been circulating a petition, and there doesn't appear to be a public outcry  calling for the banning of fireworks."  </P> <P> In October, Fire Chief Ron Coleman warned the council that people from  neighboring cities that outlaw fireworks increasingly were coming to Fullerton  to use them. As a result, Coleman said the dangers have increased dramatically.  </P> <P> In addition to Coleman's recommendations, two Orange County grand juries also  have urged Fullerton to ban fireworks.  </P> <P> Currently, "safe and sane" fireworks are banned in the unincorporated county  area and in 23 Orange County cities.

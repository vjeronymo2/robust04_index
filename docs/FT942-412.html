			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Observer: Fine palate Unquestionably, Samuel Courtauld was Britain's greatest collector of Impressionist painting, as anyone can judge by going along to see his collection at London's Courtauld galleries. But was he a good investor? He bought Van Gogh's self-portrait with bandaged ear for Pounds 10,000 in 1928, about Pounds 308,000 in today's terms. If auctioned today it would surely fetch Pounds 30m. Renoir's La Loge cost Courtauld Pounds 24,000 in 1925 - perhaps Pounds 704,000 today. Under the hammer today it might fetch Pounds 35m. As for Manet's Bar at the Folies-Bergere which set Courtauld back Pounds 24,100 - Pounds 720,000 now - in 1926, it could set a new world record, perhaps approaching Pounds 50m. And so on. Not a bad record. Today's best-known British collector - Charles Saatchi - goes more for stuffed sheep in fish-tanks. Still, by 2060 an animal - even floating in formaldehyde - might be so rare that someone will pay handsomely for it.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Sintokogio announces pre-tax profits Sintokogio, Japan's leading maker of casting machines, announced its pre-tax profits declined sharply for the financial year to March 1993. Pre-tax profits dropped by 47.9 per cent from a year earlier on lower product prices amid sluggish demand and higher personnel expenses. Sales eased by 17.6 per cent at 41.2bn. The Nagoya-based company expected a sharp 58.8 per cent drop in its pre-tax profits to Y1.4bn for the current year due to a predicted decrease in plant investment. Sales are expected to decrease by 10.3 per cent to Y37bn this year.</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> American in Paris -- Not San Diego: American soprano Diana Soviero, 44,  scheduled to sing the role of Violetta in the San Diego Opera production of  Verdi's "La Traviata" in May, will instead perform with the Paris Opera in the  spring.  </P> <P> San Diego Opera officials said Friday they will seek damages but did not  disclose the amount. Ian Campbell, general director of the opera, said he  learned of Soviero's withdrawal by reading a Paris Opera brochure. He said that  the singer had asked last May to be released from her contract for the Paris  engagement, but had been denied because he felt that he owed his audience the  promised performance.BETH KLEID  </P></p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Accountancy Column: Business school winner fails SEC test - Why the wider use of restructuring charges in the US is meeting opposition What is the difference between restructuring a company, and investing to make it more competitive in the future? What exactly is 'business process re-engineering', the latest faddish idea to sweep out of the business schools and take hold of corporate America? For accountants in the US these days, and for investors grappling with the financial statements of some of the country's biggest companies, these questions are of more than academic interest. They are also likely to become of far greater importance elsewhere around the world in the years to come, as other major economies follow the US out of recession. Substantial restructuring charges have been taken by many big US companies in recent months. They reflect a clearing of the corporate decks, as companies position themselves for a new period of growth. Such charges, often running into billions of dollars, also serve a useful accounting purpose. By reporting the charges now, in some cases wiping out current period earnings altogether, companies are able to bring forward costs which they may not actually incur for several years to come. The effect: to produce a more flattering profits trend in future. It is an issue which has vaulted to the top of the list of concerns of accounting regulators in the US. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which for months has been murmuring its disquiet about the fashion for big restructuring charges, wrote last month to around 60 companies which had reported such items. The regulatory body warned that it will scrutinise these charges carefully when the companies file their next annual 10-K reports. The SEC clearly feels the whole process is open to abuse. 'It looks as if some companies are including in the restructuring charges the costs of ordinary operations - for example advertising, legal settlements and the like,' says Mr Walter Schuetze, the agency's chief accountant. 'It may be some of these are ordinary, on-going, necessary, day-to-day costs.' Borden, a troubled foods group, this week became the first public target of the SEC's new assault on the area. Bowing to pressure from the regulators, it said it had reversed Dollars 265m of a 1992 restructuring charge. Part of these costs were reclassified as normal business costs in 1992, part were carried over into 1993. Prodded by the SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has also put the subject on the agenda for its Emerging Issues Task Force. This body was due to consider the matter at its meeting today. Finding an answer will not be easy. There is general agreement that some future costs should be recorded at once; if an asset's value has been impaired, for instance, or if a company faces a clear liability in future. But where do you draw the line? The main accounting literature governing this area, contained in FAS 5 on accounting for contingencies, offers scant help. This states that costs should be booked at once if they are 'probable' and 'reasonably estimable'. How far should this principle be stretched? On the strictest interpretation, even the costs of a big redundancy programme would not meet this test, says Mr Michael Conway, head of the professional practice department at KPMG Peat Marwick. Yet the expected costs of laying off workers, in some cases as part of a process stretching three years or more into the future, are a common feature of many restructuring charges. Other costs that increasingly appear under the general heading of restructuring charges look still more questionable. Costs associated with repositioning a product or retraining workers are becoming more common, says Mr Conway. Auditors, with little clear guidance to fall back on, are understandably concerned. How can they resist a particular company's proposed accounting treatment, particularly if clients of other audit firms have already adopted it? Restructuring costs generally fall into two types. In the first, a struggling company changes its senior management. The new chief executive moves quickly to shake up the organisation, selling off underperforming businesses, cutting costs and laying off workers, reorganising the businesses that are left. The company takes a big restructuring charge to cover the costs of the whole process. The biggest example of this last year was IBM's Dollars 8.9bn charge to cover one of the US's biggest-ever corporate restructurings. IBM - which stated it was not among the companies to receive a letter from the SEC, 'to the best of our knowledge' - said Dollars 6bn of the cost was to cover reductions in its workforce, while the rest was to meet reductions in manufacturing capacity and excess space. In the second type of restructuring, an existing management team decides it needs to act radically to make itself more competitive. This usually happens in a mature, low-growth industry - banking, say, or the provision of telephone services. The company rethinks how it carries out its most basic activities, in the process simplifying its business processes and eliminating layers of management, an approach which these days goes under the all-embracing term 're-engineering'. Should these costs also be grouped under the general heading of restructuring charges? The issue clearly causes concern in some quarters. 'I don't know what re-engineering means - it's a fashionable concept,' said Mr Schuetze at the SEC. Recent charges taken by three US 'Baby Bells' (regional telephone companies) illustrate the dilemma. Between them, Nynex, Pacific Telesis and Bell South reported charges totalling nearly Dollars 3bn for the fourth quarter of last year. Pacific Telesis said its Dollars 576m of charges reflected an intention to cut 10,000 jobs over the next three years, and what it called 'process re-engineering', though it gave little detail. Nynex, based in New York, said that Dollars 400m of its Dollars 1.6bn of charges was earmarked to cover costs associated with the company's 'efforts to fundamentally re-engineer the way it delivers services to its customers, including operation by its telephone companies as a single enterprise under the 'Nynex' brand'. Amongst other things, the company said its charges would meet the costs of 'retraining employees, relocation expenses (and) systems re-engineering'. Included in Bell South's Dollars 1.2bn of charges were similar-sounding costs. Some Dollars 550m of the cost 'is related to implementing new, state-of-art systems', it said. Announcing the charges, Mr John Clendenin, chairman and chief executive, was quoted in a press release issued by the company as saying: 'We're changing the way we do business. We're speeding up our service efforts, investing in new systems, and just making it easier for our customers to deal with us.' Can these really be termed restructuring charges? The pace of technological change means that many companies face bigger and more frequent spending on new equipment, shorter product cycles and constant organisational upheaval. How long will it be before accountants find a better way for companies' accounts to reflect this new business reality?</p>

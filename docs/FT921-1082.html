			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Plan for 24-hour soccer channel FULL TIME Communications, a new company, is planning to set up a 24-hour-a-day satellite television channel dedicated to football. It would kick off at the start of the 1993-94 season. It is believed to be the first single-sport subscription television channel in the world. The company is offering the English football authorities Pounds 50m a year for 10 years for the right to broadcast all cup and league games. The channel would show a mixture of live and recorded games in their entirety and charge a subscription of about Pounds 10 a month. Mr Gerald O'Connell, a director of Full Time who also set up Clubcall - the telephone information service for football clubs - said yesterday that negotiations with the football authorities were advanced. Full Time would want some live matches on an exclusive basis, Mr O'Connell said, but the deal would not preclude the new Premier League, the Football League or the Football Association dealing with ITV or the BBC.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wetherspoon seeks Pounds 22.1m JD Wetherspoon, the pub operator, yesterday announced a 76 per cent increase in interim profits and a Pounds 22.1m rights issue - just 17 months after the rapidly expanding chain came to the market. The group's shares have climbed rapidly since being launched at 160p and yesterday closed at 393p, up 10p on the day. The 1-for-4 rights issue is priced at 315p. The Wetherspoon estate has grown from 44 pubs at flotation to 77 today, most within greater London. The group said permissions were in place for the conversion of a further 14 sites into pubs. Ten of these were expected to open for trading by the end of the current financial year. Mr Tim Martin, chairman, said proceeds of the rights issue would be used in part to reduce short-term borrowings and finance current developments. The balance would be placed on deposit, pending further investment in the pub expansion programme. The rights issue will dilute from 22 to 18 per cent the stake held by Mr Martin, the group's 38-year-old founder, and his wife. He said: 'The proceeds of the rights issue will strengthen our capital base as we continue to invest in our expansion programme.' Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 1.49m to Pounds 2.62m in the six months to January 31, while sales rose by 56 per cent to Pounds 20.56m. Mr Martin said: 'The 24 pubs opened in the last financial year combined with the 20 pubs opened and due to open in the current financial year will have a beneficial effect on earnings for the year.' Earnings per share increased 41 per cent to 8.6p (6.1p) and the interim dividend is raised by 22 per cent to 2.2p (1.8p). COMMENT JD Wetherspoon's marketing formula - reserving up to a third of its bar space for non-smokers, and offering food all day - has clearly struck a chord with customers. The establishment of non-smoking areas slightly depressed drink sales in the first half and food is a lower margin business, but these factors were offset by the success of opening large pubs in town centres such as Croydon and Norwich. The enthusiastic Mr Martin believes the UK could eventually support 300-400 of his outlets. Given that gearing had reached 68 per cent, it seems sensible to ask shareholders to help to seize the available opportunities. The shares are on a prospective multiple of 21, which looks justified by the group's growth prospects.</p>

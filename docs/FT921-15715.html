			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Orion satellite group completes financing: BAe is partner and prime contractor to international business telecommunications service A CONSORTIUM of international companies including British Aerospace yesterday completed the Dollars 500m (Pounds 274m) financing to establish an international private satellite system in competition to those owned by the world's telephone companies. The Orion system, to be launched in 1995, will provide business telecommunication services throughout Europe and across the Atlantic. Orion, which has been under discussion since the mid-1980s, will compete with Intelsat and Eutelsat, the international and European satellite companies owned mainly by public telephone monopolies. The private US-based Pan American Satellite has a smaller competing system. In addition to being a partner in the venture, BAe will be the prime contractor to supply the satellite system. It will also be a leading service provider via satellite licences it has been awarded in recent years in the UK, Germany and France. The venture has been structured as a complicated partnership to overcome US regulations which prevent foreigners owning more than 25 per cent of any radio licence. Orion Network Systems, the US group which has been promoting the project, is the general partner, while seven international groups are limited partners of International Private Satellite Partners. Apart from BAe, the six other groups are: General Dynamics, the US defence manufacturer; Com Dev, the Canadian satellite group; Kingston Communications, the UK local telecommunications company; Matra, the French high technology group; Nissho Iwai, the large Japanese trading company; and Stet, the state-owned Italian telecommunications group. Matra and General Dynamics are sub-contractors to BAe to provide and launch the satellite system. Services will be provided both by the partners collectively through IPSP and individually since several of them have operating licences around the world. Mr Aidan Paul of Robert Fleming, the UK merchant bank which has been an adviser to the project since 1988, said Orion would concentrate on 'rooftop-to-rooftop business communications'. Businesses would be able to place satellite dishes measuring 1.2 metres across on their roofs and so establish their own private international communications networks. The Dollars 500m financing consists of Dollars 90m of equity, supplied by the partners, and Dollars 400m of debt, provided by a syndicate led by Chase Investment Bank.</p>

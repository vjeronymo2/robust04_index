			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECT IN 1983 VAN NUYS KILLING ARRESTED IN MEXICO  </P> <P> A construction engineer living openly in a small Mexican town while he was  sought by Los Angeles police has been arrested on charges he shot his  brother-in-law to death seven years ago in Van Nuys, Los Angeles police said  Monday.  </P> <P> Gregorio V. Huerta, a 41-year-old Mexican citizen who fled to the town of Jalpa  in the state of Zacatecas, was arrested Friday night after stepping out of his  home to talk to a man who said he wanted to hire Huerta for a construction  project.  </P> <P> The man Huerta thought was a customer actually was Los Angeles Police Detective  George Padilla, a member of the department's foreign prosecution unit. Huerta  was taken into custody by the Mexican state judicial police and is being held  in Zacatecas without bail.  </P> <P> Huerta was sought in connection with the slaying of Van Nuys resident Gary  Beresford after a dispute on July 18, 1983. Police had searched for Huerta ever  since Beresford, 34, was shot in an apartment on Oxnard Street. The reason for  the dispute has never been determined, police said.  </P> <P> Detective James Vojtecky, head of the Van Nuys homicide squad, said Huerta told  his arresting officers that "he had been expecting that one day the police  would come."  </P> <P> "He wasn't in hiding," Vojtecky said. "He was living a normal life. There is a  good possibility he was living there the whole time.  </P> <P> Because Mexico does not extradite its citizens for trial in the United States,  Huerta will be tried there for the murder, officials said. Los Angeles police  have provided federal prosecutors in Mexico with translated crime reports and  other evidence.  </P> <P> Soon after the slaying, information from witnesses and other evidence led  detectives to search for Huerta, the brother of Beresford's wife. An arrest  warrant was issued charging him with murder.  </P> <P> Investigators believed that Huerta had fled to his native Mexico, and his  whereabouts there were unknown. Under department policy, unsolved homicides are  reviewed annually for new leads and this year detectives recontacted witnesses  and others who knew Huerta.  </P> <P> "Once a year the case was pulled out and the detectives worked it," said  Vojtecky. "This time, certain witnesses said they believed Huerta was residing  in this small town in Mexico."  </P> <P> Detectives obtained an address where Huerta was receiving mail in Jalpa and  learned that he was working there as a construction engineer, police said.  </P> <P> Last week, Padilla and two other Los Angeles detectives went to Jalpa. At the  address Huerta used as a mail drop, Padilla posed as a man looking to hire him  for a construction project and was directed to another house where he could  find Huerta.  </P> <P> The suspect was arrested at the second address Friday night.  </P></p>

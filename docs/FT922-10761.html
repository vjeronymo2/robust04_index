			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Fall expected in lending to property groups BANK LENDING to property companies, which stands at a record Pounds 39.2bn, will decline at a rate of Pounds 2bn a year for the next four years, according to research by Savills, the firm of chartered surveyors. This heavy debt burden is one of the severest problems facing the property industry, which is suffering its biggest decline for 50 years. In spite of a marginal decline from a peak of Pounds 40.7bn last May to Pounds 39.2bn, property debt is, in real terms, more than three times what it was in 1974  - the year of the last property crash. If construction companies are included in the figures, property lending totals Pounds 55bn. The UK property sector raised Pounds 3.9bn in new funds last year, a 4 per cent decline on 1990. Nearly half the new funds came from a record number of rights issues by property companies, which raised Pounds 2.03bn. The remainder of the new funds came from Pounds 1.5bn of loans and Pounds 450m through bonds. Most of the new funds were used to refinance existing debts. Leaving aside a total of Pounds 250m that was raised by housing associations, just Pounds 780m was left as 'new' money for the industry. Net institutional investment increased from Pounds 1.3bn to Pounds 2.2bn last year, according to government statistics. However, figures from the Investment Property Databank, an independent research group, indicate a fall in net investment to just under Pounds 1bn last year. In the first quarter of this year very little new money was raised by the property industry as a result of a weak stock market and the uncertainty surrounding the general election. The UK clearing banks will need to make provisions of Pounds 3.5bn to Pounds 4bn against their property loans, according to County NatWest, the merchant banking arm of National Westminster Bank. The clearing banks have a property exposure of Pounds 17.2bn. County NatWest expects the banks to recognise the losses over a number of years, during which time they will tend to support distressed companies. County's chief concern is directed at the attitude of overseas lenders, particularly as a result of the decline in the Japanese property and equity markets. Financing Property 1992.

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Arts: A Contemporary gamble - New York Saleroom WHO SAYS that the market for Contemporary Art is in deep, deep trouble? Listen to this for Christie's description of what it is selling New York next week: 'A pantheon of the greatest Abstract Expressionist and Pop artists represented by museum-quality works, many coming from distinguished private collections. Reflecting a market trend, the traditional evening sale of Contemporary Art now includes a broader range of artists and estimates to accommodate a wider group of collectors.' Let's be honest, Christie's has style. At its big sale of Contemporary Art in New York this time last year, it sold 11 works for more than Dollars 1m and established record prices at auction for ten different artists. Next week if it is lucky, it will manage to get five paintings over the Dollars 1m mark and of those, only two - a Twombly and a Kline - are likely to make more than a couple of million. And what of records? Franz Kline's 'West Brand' is its main hope with an estimate of Dollars 2m-Dollars 3m. If that goes past Dollars 2.86m which is the record for Kline, then it will have one record. Among this year's 'broader range' are many such works including an attractive Motherwell of 1975, 'Pas de Deux, no 3', which is estimated at Dollars 70,000-Dollars 90,000; it belongs to John Kluge, who is also selling a Jackson Pollock (estimated Dollars 3-Dollars 500,000) and a Richard Linder (estimate Dollars 1-Dollars 150,000). With the free-fall in prices for works by Contemporary artists, some names have held up better than others. Franz Kline is one of them; de Kooning, Philip Guston and Cy Twombly are others. Christie's, taking care not to flood the market, has one example by all these painters next week. One other major painting on offer at Christie's is 'Bait' - a coloured silkscreen with oil on canvas by Robert Rauschenberg (estimate Dollars 1.8-Dollars 2.5m). The market's feelings about Rauschenberg are uncertain. Sotheby's had a major painting by him in its sale last November. Although that sale was not a success - 56 per cent of the lots were bought in and works by many big names were left on the block - the Rauschenberg did sell. It brought Dollars 3.08m, but that was a good Dollars 1m less than the present estimate of Dollars 4-Dollars 5m. Nevertheless, Rauschenberg is the main hope at Sotheby's again next week. An important mixed media and collage on canvas, 'Rebus', that dates from 1955 is estimated at Dollars 4-Dollars 6m. This was sold at the Victor Ganz sale in November 1988 when it was bought by the Swedish collector, Hans Thulin, for a hefty Dollars 6.33m - a record for Rauschenberg that still remains. It is estimated at a lower Dollars 4-Dollars 6m in next week's sale and it is being sold 'By order of the Creditor' of a Scandinavian Private Collector: Mr Thulin one presumes. This is not the sort of deal the auction houses like. It spells out in easily understood Wall Street terms exactly what has happened to the market: has Rauschenberg gone up or down? Whether the Rauschenberg in question is good, bad or indifferent is neither here nor there; it was never acquired for that reason. After Rauschenberg, the next most important paintings at Sotheby's - at least the most expensive - are two works by Twombly. These come from the Saatchi Collection and their sale is part of a discreet dispersal process of works from that collection which has caused ripples in the market over the past year. Saatchi is also selling a Philip Guston of 1976 (estimated Dollars 700,000-Dollars 750,000) as well as pictures by other artists. These are all 'hot' names and many people have a vested interest in seeing that prices for their work hold up. They, as much as 'the wider group of collectors' whom Christie's is expecting are the ones who may be bidding next week and for very good reason. If we see new records - or even high prices - for new names, expect to see more of those artists in auctions next Fall. Don't ask who is selling and never ask who is buying but beware: today's market for Contemporary Art is for specialists - and not necessarily art specialists.</p>

Vavilov; UDC 535.317.1]    [Abstract] Inspection of multimodular optical telescopes  with a synthesized aperture for proper phasing by means of an  achromatized diffractional hologram interferometer is proposed,  the aim being to maximize the resolving power of such telescopes  in terrestrial astronomical observatories. The scheme is  demonstrated on a bimodular telescope with four smaller mirrors  including the main one in each module and one common larger  spherical concave mirror which synthesizes the exit pupil while  forming the image of a star in its focal plane. The holographic  system consists of a spherical concave collimating mirror and a  hologram. It can operate with an either internal or external  light source. In the former case the light source, a point  source, is placed in the focal plane of a booster lens and the  hologram is placed in front of the collimating mirror. The  holographic system forms the inspecting wave, which is to  ``simulate'' the radiation entering both telescope modules upon  arrival from a star within the middle of the field of view. The  hologram is a plane mirror with a reflective diffraction  grating, an equidistant array of lines, deposited on its active  surface. Its spatial frequency has been selected so as to ensure  that radiation in +1 and -1 diffraction orders will impinge on  the main mirror of module ``+1'' and module ``-1'' respectively.  Each of these mirrors is covered by a projecting reflective  hologram with zero-order optical power and the same spatial  carrier frequency. The collimating mirror and the holographic  mirror can be combined a single reflective or transmissive  hologram. A theoretical analysis of the inspection process,  taking into the geometry of this scheme, indicates that  decreasing the spatial frequency of the holograms will allow  widening the tolerances on the telescope parameters. For  verification, an experiment was performed using an incandescent  lamp as the light source and diffraction gratings with 200  lines/mm each. The hologram before the collimator was used as a  measuring bridge and a Fourier objective with its optical axis  passing through the center of that hologram was simulating a  phased telescope with a synthesized aperture. Following  appropriate adjustment of the three holograms in the focal plane  of this objective, a high-contrast achromatic interference  pattern was seen which remained stationary while the lamp was  being moved in the focal plane of its booster lens.

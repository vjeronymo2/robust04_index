			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Berlusconi's broadcasts raise worries Prominent Italian left-wing and centrist politicians yesterday warned against the misuse of media power after Saturday's decision by Mr Silvio Berlusconi to use his private television channels to broadcast a 90-minute press conference outlining his political ambitions. Prime-time viewers of Canale 5, the most popular of the three channels owned by Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest group, were dumbfounded to find an advertised feature film replaced by an unedited broadcast of Mr Berlusconi's political debut before the foreign press association in Rome the previous day. Earlier on Saturday, the schedule on Rete 4, another Fininvest channel, was changed to make way for the same event. Together, the three Fininvest channels regularly account for the lion's share of Italian viewing figures. The summary use of the two channels confirmed fears among Mr Berlusconi's critics, who last week warned of possible abuse of his media interests. Yesterday, Mr Vincenzo Vita, of the left-wing Democratic Party of the Left, said it highlighted the 'risks connected to Berlusconi's presence in broadcasting'. Mr Giorgio Napolitano, president of the lower house of parliament and a senior member of the left-wing Democratic Party of the Left, pointed to the risks inherent in any leading businessmen getting into politics. In such circumstances, 'the institutions (of the state) must take responsibility to guarantee the maximum balance in use of the media', he said.</p>

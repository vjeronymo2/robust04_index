Chinese Premier Li Peng made this remark today in his  government work report to the second session of the Eighth  National People's Congress, which opened here today.    According to the premier, the economic restructuring this  year mainly covers the reform of finance and taxation systems,  banking system, the changing of the operating mechanism for  state-owned enterprises with a view to establishing a modern  enterprise system, and the pricing system.    The implementation of the plan for the reform of finance and  taxation system is aiming at rationalizing the distribution of  revenues between the central and local authorities and between  the state and enterprises, Li Peng said. Li defined the plan as  feasible because it provides for a gradual increase in the  financial resources of the central authorities and at the same  time takes into full consideration the interests of local  authorities and enterprises, thus encouraging both central and  local initiative.    Governments at all levels should take the interests of the  whole into account and ensure that the plan for reform is  carried out smoothly.    The steady reform of the banking system aims to establish a  strong macro-control system under which the central bank  regulates the supply of currency and stabilizes its value. In  addition, Li added, the functions of commercial banks should be  separated from those of non-commercial ones. In this aspect,  the government is to establish the National Development Bank,  the Import-Export Bank of China and the Agricultural Development  Bank of China. The special state banks should be changed  gradually into commercial state banks.    Early this year China unified its official rate of exchange  of RMB with the market rate. Li Peng called for strict control  over total income for exports and outgo for imports and over  international repayments of capital to prevent loss of foreign  exchange. The People's Bank of China should tighten its control  over the market, facilitating buying and selling, regulating the  supply of foreign exchange when necessary and preventing drastic  fluctuations in the rates.    According to Li Peng, the government is currently in  financial straits and it will take a certain amount of time to  alleviate the difficulties. This year there is still a fairly  large deficit in the central budget as the government has to  repay both capital and interest on many domestic and external  debts, lighten financial burden on state enterprises, carry out  price reform and increase wages. However, he noted, the deficit  of the central government would be made up by issuing bonds  instead of overdrawing on the bank again. "This year we will  try not to issue too much currency and credit, so as to prevent  investment from swelling," Li added.    Referring to the pricing reform, Li Peng said that this year  the prices of grain, cotton and energy will be adjusted to  rationalize price relations. In reforming the pricing system,  the government should take into full consideration the tolerance  capacities of the state, enterprises and the masses, make an  overall plan and carry it out steadily.    He stated that governments at all levels and relevant  sectors  of society should make joint efforts to keep retail prices from  rising more than 10 percent; in particular, they should try to  control the rise of prices for basic consumer goods and services  that are closely related to the well-being of the people.    The reform of state-owned enterprises is the central and  most  difficult task in the reform of the economic structure, Li Peng  said. The fundamental way to reinvigorate state enterprises is  to deepen the reform, change the way they operate and establish  a modern enterprise system, under which the property rights and  responsibilities of the enterprises are clearly defined, the  functions of the government are separated from those of the  enterprises and the enterprises are managed in a scientific way.    On reforming the structure of government institutions and  changing their functions, Li Peng said the State Council this  year will introduce the system of public service, further alter  the functions of government institutions and raise their  efficiency. At the same time, institutional restructuring will  be completed in most provincial governments and started in a  number of county governments.    To carry on the struggle against corruption for a long time  to come is a matter of life and death for the nation and an  important means of guaranteeing the smooth advance of reform and  economic development, Li Peng said.    Government functionaries should bear in mind that the abuse  of the power in their hands for personal gains is diametrically  opposed, Li concluded.</p>

			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> DANGER: Contrary to popular belief, the younger child is not the one most often  injured by fireworks. . . . The National Fire Protection Assn. says  10-to-14-year-olds suffer the most, nearly 50% more than either older  teen-agers or the 5-to-9-year-olds. . . . "They get cherry bombs and want to  hold things and be macho," says an emergency room nurse. . . . An exception:  Almost half of all sparkler injuries are to children younger than 5 because  some parents think that sparklers are harmless. They burn at 1,200 degrees,  sear flesh and ignite hair and clothes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fireworks Toll For Orange County in 1989  </P> <P> Fires caused by fireworks:  </P> <P> Legal: 58%  </P> <P> Illegal: 41%  </P> <P> Unkown: 1%  </P> <P> </P> <P> Injuries caused by fireworks:  </P> <P> Legal: 47%  </P> <P> Illegal: 37%  </P> <P> Unkown: 16%  </P> <P> Source: State Fire Marshall Steve Emmons and Jeffrey A.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Federal President Richard von  Weizsaecker has called for a "merging" of German and Russian  interests. This ought also to benefit neighboring countries,  Weizsaecker said at a luncheon in Bonn today in honor of Russian  President Boris Yeltsin. The Federal Republic's firm  integration in NATO and the European Union is an important  prerequisite for the success of this path. [as received]    The federal president stressed that the growing integration  of the Russian Federation into the European and international  institutions is equally important for Germans. The countries  located between Germany and Russia should also be included in  this process in a trusting way.    Weizsaecker described Russia as "a great nation." The  Germans have themselves been able to experience this and are  grateful to Russia. The federal president added: "How else  would the regaining of state unity have been possible for us in  freedom?" With this, the Russian people have not only  demonstrated their magnanimity but had also "shown far-sighted  trust in the common future of our peoples."    We now have to prove ourselves worthy of this strength and  shoulder the tasks facing us responsibly and with optimism.  Weizsaecker stressed: "For me it is one of the miracles of  history that the suffering Hitler inflicted on Russia could not  destroy the deep inner relationship between Germans and  Russians."    The German president stressed that the opportunities  currently available are "historically unprecedented." They  would not exist without the persistence and strength of the  Russian people, nor without the desire for reform and personal  courage of Yeltsin. Addressing the Russian president,  Weizsaecker added: "The images of August 1991, when you risked  your life to resist force and fought for free human rights,  became documents of world history and will remain for posterity  an example of what the actions and convictions of an individual  can achieve."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ireland/Italy: Sinn Fein Leader </F> Adams Visits Italy"]    [Text] (ANSA) London, May 18 -- The leader of Ireland's  Sinn Fein party, Gerry Adams, left today for a five-day visit to  Italy aimed at informing public opinion on the situation in  Northern Ireland.    Sinn Fein is viewed as the political wing of the underground  Irish Republican Army and Adams has already made similar visits,  despite protests from London, to the United States and, last  week, the Basque regions.    Adams is slated to meet in Venice with Martino Dorigo, MP  for  Communist Refoundation, and in Turin with another Communist MP,  Marco Rizza, before winding up his visit Monday with a press  conference.</p>

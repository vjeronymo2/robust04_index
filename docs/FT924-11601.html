			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Old Lady's slip shows: The flaws in UK banking supervision Bank regulation is the art of shutting stable doors after the horse has bolted. This aphorism was used yesterday by Sir George Blunden, the former deputy governor of the Bank of England. What he meant was that new laws and supervisory practices are always introduced after a banking scandal has taken place, never in time to prevent a scandal. Thus on Thursday the Bank of England and the Treasury announced amendments to the 1987 Banking Act and the creation of specialist legal and investigative units at the Bank to prevent the repetition of a fraud similar to that uncovered at the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the international bank which was closed in July 1991. The likelihood of there being another BCCI-style fraud is small, however. The breathtaking magnitude of BCCI's corruption was only possible because the bank operated in a vast number of different countries, each of whose regulators only had responsibility for monitoring a tiny piece in the BCCI jigsaw. Over the past few years, bank regulators have begun to act more in concert in monitoring international banks - and this co-ordinated approach to supervision has been reinforced recently by a new agreement between regulators of the leading industrial countries who are members of the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision. But there is always another banking disaster waiting around the corner, one that the regulators never dreamed could happen and therefore could take no precautions against. Regulation only comes after unforeseen events. The Bank of England only adopted its regulatory role after the secondary banking crisis of 1973, when a raft of new financial institutions borrowed from the big clearing banks and then used the funds to make property loans. When the property market collapsed, the financial system itself was threatened. By 1979 the Bank had sufficient monitoring powers to ensure that banks in general could be prevented from acquiring excessive exposures to a particular market. But it still lacked the resources and the appropriate legal framework to keep a close watch on individual banks. So when Johnson Matthey Bank had to be rescued by the Bank in 1984 - after JMB made imprudently large loans - the Bank acquired yet more powers in the 1987 Banking Act. Both the government and the Bank felt that the explicit responsibilities of the Bank had to be codified and extended. Sir George says, with only a hint of facetiousness, that there is an unstoppable cycle in banking collapses and that the next calamity will happen in 'five or six years'. If he is right, correcting the shortcomings identified by Lord Justice Bingham in his report will not prevent the next crisis. Sir George is one of the few officals to emerge with any credit from the report, which details the Bank's inept attempts to keep BCCI sound. Lord Bingham cites two occasions - in 1987 and in 1989 - when Sir George urged other Bank officials to force BCCI to incorporate its UK operations. The effect would have been to give greater responsibility for monitoring BCCI's activities to the Bank. Had Sir George's advice been followed, the fraud at BCCI might have been detected earlier and losses eventually suffered by thousands of depositors might have been reduced. Unfortunately, Sir George was a lone voice in the wilderness - and anyway cannot escape his share of the collective responsibility, having been associated with supervision since 1974. The Bingham report cites ineptitude and negligence by Bank officials on widespread scale. The report says Bank officials did not understand their powers, or their responsibilities to intervene in BCCI's affairs under the 1979 Banking Act. Their consistent response for more than a decade to the growing complexity of BCCI's operations - and to a series of allegations that it was involved in fraud - was to shy away from supervising it more closely, for fear that the job was simply to big and complex. They preferred to follow the letter, rather than the spirit, of international agreements between bank regulators, and therefore ceded the primary responsibility for monitoring BCCI to the Luxembourg authorities, despite the authorities' insistence that the Bank was far better placed to do the job properly. The report indicates that the Bank passed the buck for taking supervisory responsibility for BCCi whenever possible. On several occasions, allegations of fraud were left to the police to investigate, or ignored by officials altogether. One of the most damaging repercussions from the report's criticisms may be to undermine the Bank's moral authority in the City. It will be less able to command respect after Lord Bingham's portrait of it as feeble, so any residual hope that financial practitioners will feel responsible for following the spirit of City of London laws and codes must be commensurately reduced. Sir George draws the lesson from the BCCI saga that 'regulators are good at dealing with people wanting to be proper bankers - they are not good at dealing with fraud'. But Lord Bingham does not recommend that the Bank's traditional technique of supervision, which is based on trust and willingness on the part of bankers to co-operate, should be changed fundamentally. This system is relatively cheap to operate and has worked well in preventing severe financial difficulties at most banks. The more interventionist and aggressive US model of banking supervision carried out a range of institutions has been rejected. It requires the employment of more officials and is thus more expensive to operate. Though the Bank of England is unlikely to be as remiss in the future supervision of a bank as it was in the case of BCCI, there is a hidden cost in the UK supervisory approach, which falls on bank customers. Periodically, the Bank's trust in bankers proves misplaced, with the result that a bank may collapse, leading to losses for its customers of the uninsured portion (75 per cent up to a maximum of Pounds 15,000) of their deposits (in the US, deposit insurance in effect covers all deposits). The justification for imposing this risk on bank customers is that they will put pressure on banks to behave prudently, because they will only place their funds with soundly managed banks. However, it is impossible for customers to know for certain that a bank is sound. Even the most ostensibly conservative of banks can run into difficulties. Adam Bank, a small, private bank managed along prudent lines, recently had to be rescued when all its capital was wiped out by Pounds 21m currency losses incurred by three dealers operating outside the bank's normal rules. So depositors may be tempted to put all their funds with the big four clearing banks. The repercussions of the collapse of any of them would pose such a risk to the entire financial system that the government and the Bank would not allow them to fail, no matter how poor the service they may offer or their relative inefficiency compared with many smaller banks.</p>

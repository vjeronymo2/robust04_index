			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Chirac appeals for Balladur's loyalty Tension among Gaullist rivals for the French presidency burst into the open this weekend as Mr Jacques Chirac, the party leader, declared his 'passion' for the presidential contest due next year and appealed for loyalty from his former protege, Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, who now far outstrips him in the opinion polls. At the annual 'summer university' of young members of the RPR Gaullist party, at Bordeaux, Mr Chirac's hold on the party machine he has led for 20 years was amply demonstrated by the chants of 'Chi-rac pre-si-dent', and by the open endorsement he received from Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister, who is also RPR secretary-general. But, for the first time, a senior RPR member suggested that the party should endorse neither Mr Chirac nor fellow-Gaullist Mr Balladur, so as to avoid being torn apart by their rivalry. In proposing this, Mr Philippe Seguin, the National Assembly president, who prefers Mr Chirac to the prime minister, was reported yesterday as having said that such neutrality 'would not take a single vote away from Chirac'. In fact, Mr Chirac might gain by not being so tightly wrapped in the RPR flag as in his past presidential bids, when he failed to win centrist support. But the more obvious beneficiary of RPR neutrality would be Mr Balladur, who already has wide appeal for the RPR's coalition partner, the UDF centre-right federation. This grouping is nominally led by Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, but its biggest component, the Republican Party (PR), now far prefers the emollient Mr Balladur to the ex-president. Two PR ministers redoubled their calls over the weekend for a 'unity' candidate within the majority, by which they mean Mr Balladur. Mr Gerard Longuet, trade and industry minister, quipped: 'In contrast to the spirit of the Olympic Games, the important thing is to win, not to participate'. For his part, Mr Francois Leotard, defence minister, complained of 'snipers within the (government) majority', perhaps with his foreign ministry colleague in mind. Mr Juppe told young Gaullists Mr Chirac 'should lead the way - and he knows that you will be there, and me with you, to follow him'. He has thus broken the truce on ministers revealing their presidential preferences. His action is no surprise, given his RPR post and his feeling of being marginalised sometimes by Mr Balladur on foreign policy. Even so, it may bode ill for discipline this autumn in the government and in parliament, where the RPR leader, Mr Bernard Pons, is urging Mr Chirac to make his candidacy formal as soon as possible. Mr Chirac is said not to want to do so before January, knowing Mr Balladur will make no official move before then. On the other hand, the former clearly wants to use this autumn to let Mr Balladur know there will be a fight with his party leader. Mr Chirac is aware the prime minister does not like open confrontation. Mr Chirac hinted it was now time for the prime minister to reciprocate past loyalty. 'For years, I have given Edouard Balladur all my confidence and my friendship,' he said. After the parliamentary election victory last year, 'to which I ardently contributed, I wanted his nomination to the Matignon (the premier's office), and I did what was necessary for that.' Concluding on a note that perhaps stretched his audience's credulity, Mr Chirac said: 'I do not regret it'.</p>

			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RATING FIRM DOWNGRADES BONDS OF BREA'S UNIONFED  </P> <P> Executives at UnionFed Financial Corp. will not discuss yet the "significant"  loss the holding company is about to report, but a national bond-rating firm  Tuesday said it is not waiting for details.  </P> <P> Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago said it expects to downgrade both the senior debt  securities and the short-term certificates of deposit at the company's main  subsidiary, Union Federal Savings Bank in Los Angeles, once the company reveals  the extent of its problems.  </P> <P> The company, which recently moved its headquarters to Brea from Los Angeles,  said last week that its deteriorating real estate loans and holdings would lead  to a loss for the fiscal year ended June 30, reversing a previously reported  $11.1-million year's profit.  </P> <P> The company said the loss stemmed from a substantial increase in its reserves  that had been ordered by federal thrift regulators, who are conducting an  examination of the institution.  </P> <P> UnionFed's deteriorating condition has made it one of the biggest third-quarter  losers on the New York Stock Exchange. Its stock price dropped 73.8% -- the  sixth-worst performance on the Big Board during the third quarter -- and 85.3%  during the first nine months of the year, the 10th-worst performance. Its stock  closed Friday at $2.625 a share.  </P> <P> The company expects to report its adjusted financial statement early next week.  Until then, Duff &amp; Phelps has the S&amp;L's bonds and short-term  certificates of deposit on a watch list with an "unfavorable trend"  designation.  </P> <P> The Chicago firm, however, acknowledged that the S&amp;L, with $2.5 billion in  deposits and 27 branches in Los Angeles and Orange counties, has a major  advantage on its side.  </P> <P> "While Union Federal has experienced serious deterioration in asset quality  over recent quarters," the rating company said, "its substantial capital base  provides a large layer of protection, and its large level of core deposits  provides funding stability."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Luo Yuwen (5012 3768 2429)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a group  discussion attended by National People's Congress [NPC] deputies  from the Chinese Liberation Army [PLA] today, Liu Huaqing,  member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing  Committee and vice chairman of the Central Military Commission,  stressed that all PLA commanders and fighters must have a clear  understanding of the historical missions that they carry on  their shoulders, must actively promote the modernization of the  national defense, and must provide a powerful security guarantee  for reform, opening up, and modernization.    Liu Huaqing said: The guidelines laid down by the 14th  National Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee have been successfully reflected in  the basic policy and tasks for 1994 which Premier Li Peng has  clearly outlined in his "Government Work Report." The "report"  has especially stressed that seizing the opportunity, deepening  reform, opening wider to the outside world, expediting  development, and maintaining stability are the requirements of  overall importance for the country; and that the relations  between reform, development, and stability must be handled  properly. Comrades in the armed forces must obey and serve  these requirements of overall importance and contribute to  reform, opening up, and economic development, as well as to  safeguarding the motherland's security.    Liu Huaqing said: China is a socialist country, and our  efforts to speed up the modernization of our national defense  are totally for defensive purposes so that our motherland's  territorial land, waters, and airspace will not be violated, the  unification and stability of our country can be safeguarded, and  people of all nationalities in the country can dedicate  themselves to socialist modernization. The annual military  budget of our big country is very low compared to countries of  the world. While our military budget cannot be compared to  those of the developed countries, it is even much lower than  those of certain neighboring countries.    Liu Huaqing said: The Chinese people are a peace-loving  people. We suffered immensely from foreign powers' aggression  for more than a century, and the wounds of foreign aggression  are keenly felt. The Chinese people, who have stood up, will  absolutely not permit any aggressors to trample on our national  sovereignty and interests, will never seek hegemony, and will  never seize an inch of foreign territory. China will not embark  on an arms race, nor will we join any military blocs or create  spheres of influence. This is our consistent stand. For a long  time to come, China will concentrate its efforts on developing  production and improving the people's living standards. We will  adhere to the party's basic line for 100 years without wavering.  Not only is this in the interest of China, but it is also in  the interest of Asia and the world as a whole.    Liu Huaqing noted: The armed forces made new headway in all  fields in 1993. New successes were achieved in improving party  members' conduct and in promoting honesty and administrative  ethics in the armed forces. Many heroes with Xu Honggang as the  model came to the fore. An upsurge of the troops' training  occurred, and an unusually good situation in military training  appeared. New headway was also achieved in defense science and  technology research and in improving logistical support.    Liu Huaqing said: To intensify the modernization of  national defense, we must follow the guidance provided by  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and his thoughts on military  construction during the new period, pay attention to quality,  firmly follow the path of building crack troops with Chinese  characteristics, and comprehensively build up our armed forces  in accordance with the general requirement put forth by Chairman  Jiang Zemin that the PLA must be "politically measured up,  militarily toughened, outstanding in work style, strict in  discipline, and powerful in defense." In order to improve the  PLA's combat-readiness, current and future work will primarily  be on strengthening its ideological and political construction,  developing modern weaponry, training commanders and technical  specialists with the skills needed in modern warfare, and  bringing about the best combination of people and weapons  through scientific organization and rigorous training. We still  have some difficulties with regard to military budgets and  military construction, we must therefore carry forward the "five  types of revolutionary spirit" which Comrade Deng Xiaoping  advocated and Chairman Jiang Zemin's "64-character pioneering  spirit" [liberate the mind, seek truth from facts, actively  explore, be brave in innovating, wage arduous struggle, proceed  despite difficulties, learn from foreign countries, make  persistent efforts to improve ourselves, be humble and prudent,  guard against complacency and rashness, work with one heart and  one mind, take the interests of the whole into consideration,  work diligently and practice economy, be upright and honest,  rouse ourselves to build a stronger nation, and make selfless  dedication], wage arduous struggle, build the armed forces  through diligence and thrift, strive to improve the economic  efficiency of military projects, and proceed while overcoming  difficulties.    Liu Huaqing said: The rock-solid Army-government and  Army-people solidarity is important in enhancing social  stability and ensuring national peace. We must always preserve  this fine tradition under the new situation. He said:  Army-government and Army-people relations have been developing  satisfactorily in recent years. Projects to support the  government, cherish the people, support the military, and give  preferential treatment to military families are making progress  and improving. Military and local authorities must bear in mind  the overall interests of the country and take the initiative in  promoting Army-government and Army-people solidarity, in  consolidating and developing new Army-government and Army-people  relationships, and contribute positively to expediting economic  construction and social stability. The PLA must remain humble  and prudent and respect local party committees and government  under all circumstances. All officers and men in the armed  forces must always bear in mind the code which requires them to  serve the people wholeheartedly, and set an example in following  the party's lines and general and specific policies and state  laws and regulations. The PLA must actively support and take  part in local economic construction projects, help the local  people solve problems, correct conduct improper for party  members, guard against the inroads of corrosion, advocate work  ethics, establish a good image, and be brave in fighting social  evils. We must rally even more closely around the CPC Central  Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, and work hard  together with the people in the country to achieve new victories  in reform, opening up, and modernization.</p>

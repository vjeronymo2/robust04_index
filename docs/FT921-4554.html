			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Budget cuts stand little chance of success PLANNED budget spending cuts by Poland's embattled centre-right government led by Mr Jan Olszewski stand little chance of winning a majority in parliament when the document comes up for debate next month. The International Monetary Fund has told the government that the budget deficit must stay within 5 per cent of GDP to guard against re-igniting inflation. Should this target be over-stepped, then Poland will jeopardise its chances of putting relations with the IMF back on an even keel. Mr Olszewski's government has managed to find cuts worth Zl37,000bn (Pounds 1.59bn), and is seeking further savings of Zl27,000bn to cut the budget deficit to its Zl65,500bn target. However, a cabinet meeting on Friday heard that the proposed budget would mean cuts in subsidies to rail travel and coal production as well as job losses for school teachers and health service employees. Last Thursday, parliament voted overwhelmingly for spending on health and education to be kept at last year's levels in real terms and is unlikely to accept the proposed cuts. Mr Olszewski has said he will resign if the draft is not approved by the politically-fragmented parliament, where nine parties jockey for position. The World Bank has also warned the Poles that the budget deficit must be kept under control and is urging speedy privatisation and growth in the level of exports as the means of breaking out of the current impasse.</p>

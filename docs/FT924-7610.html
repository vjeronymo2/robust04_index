			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Brussels considers steel aid proposals THE European Commission may ask east and central European countries to impose export taxes on steel production, under a draft plan to protect Community manufacturers from cheap imports. It is also considering ways of strengthening protective measures, such as duties on steel 'dumped' in the Community, and safeguarding clauses in existing political and trade agreements with Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia. Commissioners will debate the plan to help the ailing EC steel industry on Wednesday in Strasbourg. It should include the offer of Ecu240m (Pounds 195m) over three years to help lay off or retrain as many as 50,000 steelworkers, plus further funds for plant closures and rationalisation. EC steelmakers last month called for a far-reaching programme of political, commercial and financial assistance and will lobby commissioners before their meeting. Brussels officials failed on Friday to decide whether such a plan could be funded from the existing budget and reserves of the European coal and steel treaty, as well as structural funds. But there is greater consensus among commissioners on capacity cuts - which would be based on a consultancy report to the industry - and so-called 'external' measures. The Commission's trade and external affairs directorate is understood to have suggested an export tax as one solution to the problem of cheap non-EC imports. However, some officials feel this would be at odds with the EC's attempts to encourage free trade with eastern Europe and the ex-Soviet Union and would almost certainly be rejected by the countries concerned.</p>

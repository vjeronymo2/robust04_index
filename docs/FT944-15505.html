			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Riva loss deepens to Pounds 629,000 Increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 629,000, against Pounds 425,000, were announced by Riva Group, the USM-quoted supplier of electronic point of sale systems, for the half year to June 30. The result was in line with expectations, said Mr Peter Giles, chairman. Revenue was stable but, in common with the industry, there were declining hardware margins. He said the outcome for the year was sensitive to volumes in the last quarter but was not expected to show a significant improvement on the first half. Turnover edged ahead to Pounds 27m (Pounds 26.4m). Losses per share deepened to 2.5p (1.9p).</p>

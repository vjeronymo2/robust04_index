			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Italian coalition's divisions damage lira and equities: Berlusconi defends decree limiting magistrates' powers of arrest The Italian lira and the Milan stock market fell sharply yesterday as Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, tried to prevent his right-wing coalition government splitting over a decree limiting the judiciary's powers of arrest. The lira touched a low of L1,003 against the D-Mark before recovering to L1,002 compared with L993.8 on Friday. It also lost ground against the French franc, falling from L289.9 to L292.1. But it remained virtually unchanged against the dollar at just over L1,547. Milan's Comit share index steadied after a sharp fall to close 3 per cent down. Mr Berlusconi, who provoked the crisis last Thursday by approving a decree that has allowed dozens of leading corruption suspects to leave prison, appeared on television last night to defend the decision and to attempt to quash speculation about the future of his government. 'We are absolutely not a step away from a government crisis, ' he said. 'The decree is not an amnesty for anyone. We need to have civilised debate, not screaming in the piazza.' A spokesman for the prime minister said Mr Berlusconi was not taking a rigid line on the decree. He said it was open to amendment, although the basic principles underlying the decree must remain. The decree led to the immediate resignation of the popular team of Milan magistrates who have been largely responsible for attacking civil service and business corruption in Italy in the past two years. But it has also shaken Mr Berlusconi's two coalition partners, the Northern League and the neo-fascist MSI/ National Alliance, which benefited in the spring election from anti-corruption records and which want the decree repealed. The subsequent infighting between Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia party and the two coalition partners has already led to the senior League member of the government saying he had been deceived over the decree. Forza Italia ministers came close yesterday to accusing him of lying. The row has poisoned already poor relations between the coalition partners, particularly between the League and Mr Berlusconi and, although threats by both sides to either resign or provoke new elections seem unlikely to come to a head, scope for compromise is limited. Analysts believe that the government, whose popularity has been dented by the affair, may be able to reach a quieter compromise by the time it is discussed in parliament, which has to ratify the decree within the next three months. But there was little evidence of an improvement in the political atmosphere yesterday. The League said that it would today ask a parliamentary commission that the decree on the custody of corruption suspects be withdrawn. That tension will continue to worry the markets, analysts say. Mr Paolo Azzoni, a Milan stockbroker, yesterday described the situation as dangerous. Foreign investors were reducing their exposure in Italian stocks and Mr Azzoni said that markets needed a clear sign that the split in government had been resolved. Without this, stock prices were likely to slip further. International bonds, Page 24 Currencies, Page 27 World stocks, Page 33 See Lex</p>

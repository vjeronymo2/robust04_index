Most likely, the  Federation Council and Duma will hold separate sessions on that  day.    A presidential administration spokesman has told INTERFAX  that the Federation Council and State Duma Organizing  Committees, led by Vladimir Shumeyko and Sergey Filatov, will  submit to Yeltsin shortly their recommendations on how  parliamentary sessions should be held. Their guidelines will  make up the basis of an appropriate instruction.    Duma is due to meet in the former building of the Mayor's  Office on New Arbat, 36, and the Federation Council -- in the  former Russian Press House on Bolshaya Dmitrovka, 26.</p>

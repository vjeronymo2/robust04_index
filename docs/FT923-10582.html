			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / UN chief endorses wider role in Croatia MR BOUTROS Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, yesterday proposed a further enlargement of the world body's responsibilities in Croatia despite his earlier complaint that it was already over-extended in former Yugoslavia. Specifically, he endorsed 'with some misgiving' a recommendation by General Satish Nambiar, the UN force commander, that his staff be authorised to control civilian entry into UN-protected areas and exercise immigration and customs functions at their borders. Additionally, the secretary-general said there was a possibility of establishing a UN military presence in the Prevlaka Peninsula, between Dubrovnik and Serbia-Montenegro, to ensure that it stayed demilitarised. In seeking a Security Council mandate, he stressed that his recommendations illustrated how the situation in former Yugoslavia had brought about the UN's involvement in 'quasi-governmental functions which go beyond normal peace-keeping practice'. Croatia and the Serbia have agreed on the release of all prisoners from their conflict in Croatia, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said yesterday, Reuter reports from Geneva. The ICRC said the Yugoslav prime minister, Mr Milan Panic, and the Croatian deputy prime minister, Mr Mate Granic, had agreed to release the remaining 1,200 prisoners under ICRC auspices by August 7. The ICRC said it had already helped secure the release of 4,000 prisoners from the conflict.</p>

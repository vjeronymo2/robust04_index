			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Appointments: Going up  .. and on The fifth generation of the Fothergill family is moving into the top office at Pickerings, Britain's oldest lift manufacturer. Donald Fothergill, aged 29, is taking over from his father, Christopher, as managing director of the 138-year-old Teesside company. The arrival of young Donald, who earned his MBA at Henley management school, means that three generations of the family are now represented on the board. Donald's grandfather, John, is president, and his father continues as executive chairman. The group, which employs just under 500, is one of the founders of the National Association of Lift Makers. Among its recent contracts are the installation of nine lifts at the Fujitsu factory at Newton Aycliffe and six lifts at the Metropole Hotel on London's Edgware Road. Over the past five years turnover has more than doubled to Pounds 24m with profits of around Pounds 3m in 1990.</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / French output up strongly French industrial production rose strongly in July and August, increasing by 1.3 per cent over June, according to figures from Insee, the national statistics institute. Manufacturing output rose by 0.7 per cent during the period, writes John Ridding in Paris. Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, said the figures supported his forecast that economic activity would stabilise in the current quarter and return to growth in 1994. Private sector economists and Insee, however, expressed caution. Insee described the statistics as 'fragile', adding that data for the summer period were less reliable than for other months. Industrial output in July and August, lumped together because of the summer holidays, was still 2.9 per cent down on the same period last year. Striking Air France workers were warned yesterday by Mr Bernard Bosson, transport minister, that the government would use force 'if necessary' to clear them from the runways at the two main Paris airports, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. Both Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports were yesterday thrown into chaos for the second successive day because of the strike by employees, who are protesting against proposals to cut 4,000 jobs and to reduce overtime pay at the loss-making national airline.</p>

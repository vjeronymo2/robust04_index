			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (9): Still a long-term vision - Object-oriented technology is reviving an engineering paradigm / Computer-aided software engineering 1980s, computer-aided software engineering (CASE) was heralded as the panacea to the problems of building complex computer software. By combining formal design methods and powerful tools, CASE aimed to harness the computer itself to help create useful applications quickly, easily and cheaply. Its most enthusiastic advocates said that CASE would let you model a business problem, turn a 'handle' and the software for a full-blown IT application would appear like magic. This long-term vision of the virtues of CASE remains - despite a growing realisation that it is not as easy to put into practice as was first thought. The fundamental ideas in CASE are sound: engineering discipline is good for software production and computer power can be used to help to build useful systems. But the reality is that users have been slow to adopt CASE methods and, more importantly for the software industry, they have been reluctant to buy CASE tools. There are a several reasons for the apparent failure of the CASE vision. Users were expected to throw out all of their previous development technology and invest enormous sums in re-training - which was more an act of faith than a sound business decision. Their expectations were raised to a level which could only be met by something miraculous - and CASE was, inevitably, well below this. Furthermore the technology goalposts moved. In the late 1980s, when good CASE products for proprietary mainframes and minicomputers first began to appear, attention switched to open, networked client/server systems. Such systems use several different types of computer and operating environment, each with their own idiosyncrasies. CASE tools could not cope with this change and have only recently begun to catch up. Early CASE also put greater emphasis on technology than on business problems and, in the recessionary climate of recent years, this was a mistake. There are signs of change, however. CASE methods vendors have learnt to accommodate older so-called 'legacy' systems. CASE tool suppliers have extended their products to work with network systems as targets and the emphasis has switched away from technology to business problems. In addition, CASE has received a boost from object-oriented computing. Both share common roots in engineering principles and complement each other well: object-oriented computing provides a foundation for defining software 'components' and CASE provides the mechanisms for assembling them into applications. 'CASE must be related to a business architecture. The older CASE tools were about throwing systems at chunks of the business rather than seeing the whole picture,' says Mr Roger Stenson, assistant general manager of Norwich Union's management services department. As an experienced user of CASE methods and tools, Norwich Union has had the chance to assess the value of the technology to its business. Mr Stenson has no doubts about its long-term value: 'We have to get the business of writing software away from being an art to being a branch of engineering,' he says. 'But there is still some way to go and the technology needs to mature.' Norwich Union's main CASE tool is Knowledgeware's Application Development Workbench (ADW) which maintains the business model used as the basis for application systems. It also uses Bachman Information System's data modelling tools and Softlab's Maestro CASE project management package. 'Nobody's got all of it. You have to a framework which takes in a variety of tools,' says Mr Stenson. The best-known CASE framework is IBM's Application Development (AD)/Cycle which aimed to put IBM squarely in the CASE software market along with third-party suppliers who supplied appropriate tools. AD/Cycle has not lived up to IBM's hopes - partly as a result of changes in the structure of its own market and partly because the opportunity has not been fully exploited. AD/Cycle is restricted to generating applications for IBM hardware only and this has reduced its chances of success in the open networked computing environment of today. 'Although it has some sound ideas in it, AD/Cycle has not been very successful for IBM. We have our own framework and we have kept compatible with AD/Cycle where possible. We want to keep our options open,' says Mr Stenson. Despite its high hopes for AD/Cycle, IBM has had problems building one of the key components - the data 'repository.' CASE tools need a repository to hold data about the business model, the relationships between systems and even the technology of the system itself. Development delays and the lack of repository sales has undoubtedly held AD/Cycle back. Other manufacturers have been less ambitious than IBM - but claim greater success. Amdahl, which makes IBM-compatible hardware for the mainframe market, was an early pioneer of CASE techniques with its Huron system. 'Huron is a set of tools which helps to manage software change. It has a repository at the centre where a single copy of the business model is kept. This keeps track of change in the business and the applications,' explains Mr John Paton, European sales and marketing director for the Antares Alliance Group, a CASE joint venture between Amdahl and software company EDS. 'We see facilitating change as the main role of CASE. Without the ability to re-engineer their processes easily, users start to believe it is so difficult that they can't change,' he goes on. Relating the use of CASE directly to the business has become essential - both in order to justify the application of technology and to maintain the overall integrity of the business model. 'In the past, CASE has been seen as methods based when it should be mission based. You have to remove anything that distracts from the business mission,' says Mr Paton. He adds that object-oriented computing is the key: 'It is much easier to see real world systems in terms of objects and it is not difficult for business people to define the objects that they have to deal with. It is only when the technologists get involved that things get complicated. Object-oriented computing makes it easier for the technologist and the business managers think in the same way.' In addition to being able to provide this direct link between business problems and the system, object-oriented technology shares the same engineering principles as CASE and will revive interest. 'CASE was oversold in the 1980s. People saw it as a silver bullet and expected the tools to give them a development process. We now see that you need the process first. Object technology helps us to identify this,' says Mr Don Kavanagh, a consultant with CASE tool supplier Interactive Data Environments, (IDE). 'Object let us gain a higher level understanding of the business problem and relate that back to the technology, he adds. Object-oriented technology is also having an impact on users too. Mr Stenson of Norwich Union is enthusiastic: 'The entire future of software is object-oriented and I fully endorse it. It the most critical component of where we are going with CASE. We just need more mature tools to realise the potential,' he says.</p>

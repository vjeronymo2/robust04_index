			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> Who has the world's toughest meter-maids? It could be Paramount (the city, not  the studio).  </P> <P> Last month, the Paramount Lions Club received permission from the city to  install a cautionary holiday display consisting of a wrecked automobile and a  "Don't Drink and Drive" sign in a vacant lot.  </P> <P> A few weeks later, a reporter noticed that the battered heap had been slapped  with a citation giving the owner 72 hours to remove it or face towing charges.  In a classic understatement, the meter maid checked a box on the citation that  said, "Apparently inoperative."  </P> <P> Told of the ticket, city officials suspected it might be a joke. But a check  revealed that it wasn't.  </P> <P> "Apparently the officer came up from behind the car and didn't notice the  sign," explained Deputy City Manager Pat West, adding that the warning won't be  enforced.  </P> <P> West pointed out that its enthusiastic traffic officers have helped Paramount  develop a "strong vehicle abatement program. We've caused 1,000 inoperative or  wrecked vehicles to be removed from the city in the last year."  </P> <P> Make that 999.  </P> <P> L.A. wasn't ignored in the end-of-the-year summaries of national publications:  </P> <P> * A People magazine poll found that the Beverly Hills cop-slapper was the  choice when its readers were asked: "Which of the following celebrities -- Zsa  Zsa Gabor, Morton Downey Jr., Sean Penn, Joan Rivers or Donald Trump -- would  you least like to be trapped in an elevator with?" Mort was second.  </P> <P> * Esquire magazine's "Dubious Achievements of 1989" section listed this item in  its "We-Are-but-Flowers/I'll-Have-My-Stamen-Call-Your-Stamen" category: "A club  in L.A. featured poetry recitals by Judd Nelson, Robert Downey Jr. and Justine  Bateman."  </P> <P> * And, in its own dubious-taste poll, Newsweek magazine conferred the title of  "Worst Amusement Park Ride" upon Universal Studios for "Earthquake," its  simulation of a San Francisco disaster.  </P> <P> Is this the '90s, or the free-love era of the '60s?  </P> <P> A muffler-shop sign north of the Civic Center area says:  </P> <P> FREE INSPECTION BRAKES SHOCK SEXHAUST  </P> <P> There was quite a commotion at a small Mexican restaurant on Ventura Boulevard  the other night when a customer discovered that he had misplaced his keys after  locking his car.  </P> <P> Helpful employees, as well as some customers, got down on their knees to search  under the tables. Trash cans were emptied. Counter containers of two varieties  of salsa were searched as a sanitary precaution. Flashlights were aimed inside  the car. The hunt lasted nearly a half hour.  </P> <P> Finally, a valet from a nearby Greek restaurant appeared. He calmly walked to  the rear of the car and pulled the keys out of the trunk lock. Always nice to  have a professional around.  </P> <P> But back to the '90s. Is this really going to be the decade for social  consciousness?  </P> <P> The Times received a call from one person complaining that, because of all  those responsible revelers who avoided driving New Year's Eve, it was  impossible to catch a taxi ride home from a Malibu restaurant.  </P></p>

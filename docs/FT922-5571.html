			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: Investors hostile to Sprint merger proposal - Why Wall Street has not welcomed the Dollars 2.8bn Centel deal Sprint, the US long-distance telephone company, and Centel, a large Chicago-based local and cellular telephone company, were yesterday battling to turn back a wave of investor and Wall Street hostility to the Dollars 2.8bn merger they announced on Wednesday night. The deal put a value on Centel far lower than its recent share price had indicated. Centel's stock plummeted yesterday and the share prices of most other US telecommunications companies also dropped as the market puzzled over their worth. Mr Jack Frazee, chairman of Centel, insisted at a news conference that the merger - to be achieved by a share swap - was 'the most financially attractive deal for shareholders right now' and offered important long-term advantages. The deal is the latest example of a wave of consolidation sweeping through the US telecommunications industry, thanks to technical, regulatory and financial change. If it goes through, it would create a unique business - the only US company operating in all the three leading telecommunications markets: long distance, local and cellular. But Wall Street analysts said the pact, which requires the approval of a majority of Centel shareholders, might be rejected by them, and several key investors expressed anger over the terms. Mr Kenneth Leon, an analyst at Bear, Stearns, said: 'I do not find the merger attractive and believe the company's shareholders will reject it . . . I feel the company is worth much more.' The merger, which the two companies stress would be tax free to shareholders, involves the conversion of each share of Centel's common stock into 1.37 shares of Sprint stock and would leave Centel shareholders with around 35 per cent of the combined business. Yesterday Sprint shares dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 23 1/8 , valuing each Centel share at Dollars 31 5/8 and the whole group at Dollars 2.69bn. However, many analysts had previously put a break-up value of Dollars 4bn or more on Centel and on Wednesday night, just before the merger announcement, the shares had closed at Dollars 42 1/2 . By yesterday's close they were down at Dollars 31 7/8 . The combined group will be called Sprint, and Mr William Esrey, Sprint's chairman and chief executive, will retain these titles. Mr Frazee will become president and chief operating officer of the new group, and Centel will get six seats on a 16-person board . Sprint is the third largest long-distance carrier in the US, where it has faced an uphill battle competing with industry leaders American Telephone &amp; Telegraph and MCI. It also operates local phone services in 17 states, serving more than 4m access lines. The acquisition of Centel will add another 1.6m local access lines in six states - four of them common to Sprint - and take Sprint back into the fast-growing cellular market, where Centel serves areas with a population of 20m. Ironically, Sprint sold its cellular business to Centel several years ago. Mr Esrey said the combination of the local businesses would give Sprint 'real critical mass' and produce increased efficiency and lower costs. He hoped eventually to save around Dollars 100m a year in operating costs, including a reduction of around 1,000 in combined employees. Sprint has 43,000 workers and Centel 9,300. He added that the US would increasingly see a 'blurring of the boundaries' between local telephone companies, long distance ones, cellular communications and the cable television industry. The Centel deal meant Sprint would have a head start in this process, and would be able to offer customers 'one stop shopping'. Many analysts agree the US industry is heading gradually in this direction, although there remain formidable regulatory barriers to the process. The 1984 anti-trust break-up of AT&amp;T, or Ma Bell, which used to provide both long-distance and local services, prevents AT&amp;T from entering the local market and the so-called 'Baby Bell' regional companies, which were spun out of it, from entering the long-distance market. However, these restrictions do not apply to the non-Bell companies which provide a substantial part of America's telecommunications services. Several other large telecommunications companies expressed interest in buying parts of Centel, but not all of it, and Mr Frazee said he had been surprised that the bidding had not been more active. 'There has been widespread speculation on the value of local telephone company assets. These have all been changed with this process,' added Mr Esrey. However, some Wall Street analysts argued that Centel had chosen to put itself on the market at a poor time, when other large telephone companies were already absorbed with recent acquisitions.</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Public-service tender bidders face EC curb WHITEHALL has warned companies seeking contracts to provide public services that they may not be able to cut the pay and conditions of staff who transfer to the private sector. The warning follows the government's acceptance that it must comply fully with a European Community directive protecting workers' pay and conditions when they change employers. Until now the government has argued that the directive applies only to workers in the private sector. Companies bidding for contracts under the government's contracting-out programme have usually sought to reduce wage bills by cutting staff or reducing pay and conditions. Although the EC directive makes it easier to cut staff than to reduce pay and conditions employers may also be liable for redundancy costs. The Whitehall advice is likely to discourage some companies from bidding because the contracts will be less profitable - about 80 per cent of the cost of public services is labour. It will also make it more difficult for the public sector to achieve the target of more than 10 per cent savings which the government is seeking through contracting out services. The government's interpretation of the EC directive - known as the acquired rights directive - has been disputed for five years by the European Commission, which is threatening proceedings in the European Court of Justice for alleged infringement. The Department of Employment is expected to give way to Brussels by amending UK law. The Treasury is warning officials not to rely on 1981 Transfer of Undertakings (Employment Protection) Regulations, which were meant to implement the directive, but which exclude most public sector transfers of staff. In a letter to the Central Office of Information, which is negotiating to contract out its photocopying services, the Treasury solicitor writes: 'I cannot confidently advise you that either (the UK regulations) or the Acquired Rights Directive does not apply.' The letter adds that this is a cautious view and there are reasons for taking a contrary view. Williams Lea, the reprographics company which is negotiating for a photocopying contract with the COI, has now amended its standard terms and conditions to comply with those in the public sector. It is now offering to match the Civil Service holiday and sickness entitlements, although it says there was never any suggestion staff would suffer if it won the contract. Whitehall officials are now testing the feasibility of contracting out more services such as accountancy and information technology. Progress in extending market-testing will be highlighted in next month's white paper on the Citizen's Charter.</p>

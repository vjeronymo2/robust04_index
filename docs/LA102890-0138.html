			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: YOUTHS ATTACK DRIVER OUTSIDE RESTAURANT  </P> <P> A Santa Clarita man was knocked unconscious and beaten Friday night by a gang  of teen-agers who jumped in front of his car as he drove through a restaurant  parking lot, authorities said.  </P> <P> Two suspects were arrested, but two others were still being sought Saturday,  police said.  </P> <P> Barry Leff, 41, was driving through the parking lot of the Denny's restaurant  at 18920 Soledad Canyon Road about 10:30 p.m. Friday when four teen-agers ran  in front of his car. When Leff stepped out of his car to yell at them, "he was  quickly set upon," said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Don Rodriguez.  </P> <P> Witnesses told deputies that one of the four hit Leff with a small bat,  knocking him unconscious. The four then kicked and punched Leff in the head and  body until an unidentified bystander chased them away, Rodriguez said.  </P> <P> A sheriff's sergeant patrolling nearby responded to a radio call and arrested  Tan Nguyen, 19, of Woodland Hills and a 17-year-old, also of Woodland Hills, on  suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon. Nguyen was being held Saturday in  lieu of $5,000 bail. The 17-year-old, whose name was not released because of  his age, was released to his parents.  </P> <P> Leff was taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital, where he was treated  for injuries to his head and face and released.  </P></p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Clinton offers Dollars 4bn cut to spending plan PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday offered to cut about Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) from his Dollars 16bn economic stimulus package, but Senator Bob Dole, Republican leader, promptly rejected the compromise and again demanded offsetting spending cuts. Mr Clinton's new approach, made 'reluctantly' according to the White House, is intended to break the Republican filibuster and will be first tested in a Senate vote on Tuesday. The White House said the essence of the jobs creation proposals remained intact, as did the immunisation and Aids programmes to which the Republicans have objected as inappropriate for economic stimulus. The administration also added yesterday another Dollars 200m for recruitment of more policemen. Mr Clinton, who has been lobbying intermittently to break the filibuster, criticised the 'unwillingness of the minority' to appreciate the need to create more jobs. The White House spokesman said 'the ball in now in the Republican court.' The latest data yesterday provided further evidence that the economic recovery had begun to lose some steam. Industrial production last month remained unchanged from February, breaking a run of five consecutive monthly advances. In February the index had risen by 0.6 per cent and in January by 0.3 per cent. The mid-March blizzard that shut down much of the east coast particularly affected textiles, steel, furniture, tobacco and clothing. The Commerce Department also reported a fractional widening in the US merchandise trade deficit in February, to Dollars 7.2bn from Dollars 7.16bn in January. Exports and imports were virtually unchanged, but the export growth rate turned negative, mostly a reflection of weakened demand among the main US trading partners. The figures, announced just before Mr Clinton was to meet Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, in the White House, showed the US deficit with Japan growing to Dollars 4.13bn in February from Dollars 3.90bn in the previous month.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / International Bonds: Minimal issue supply in choppy conditions Choppy conditions in the underlying government bond markets kept Eurobond issuance to a bare minimum. 'It's not a very constructive environment - investors are still very, very cautious and although we've seen some nibbling, the markets are still fragile,' said one syndicate manager. The Canadian dollar sector saw the bulk of yesterday's meagre supply: CDollars 165m of 10-year bonds for the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto via ScotiaMcLeod, and CDollars 150m of two-year notes for Landesbank Schleswig-Holstein via Nomura. Both deals were targetted mainly at continental European retail investors and medium-sized institutions but neither issue met heavy demand, traders said. The sterling sector was abuzz with talk of imminent 10-year issues, but a volatile gilt market kept investors and issuers firmly on the sidelines. Eastern Electric was rumoured to be planning a Pounds 350m 10-year deal via CS First Boston and BZW. Abbey National and Cable &amp; Wireless were also tipped as possible issuers. Elsewhere, there was talk that Sweden is poised to issue Y100bn of five-year Euroyen bonds, although dealers warned there would not be enough demand for such a large deal. Belgium was also expected to bring its widely rumoured French franc issue, some said as early as today.</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> SUBSTITUTE TEACHER BASE SALARY RAISED  </P> <P> In response to an areawide shortage of substitute teachers, the La Habra City  School District has increased their salaries.  </P> <P> Substitutes are not only needed to replace teachers who are ill, but also to  cover classes for teachers participating in workshops and other training, said  Assistant Supt. Ruth Fehr.  </P> <P> When substitute teachers cannot be found, which Fehr said happens about once a  month, school principals may fill in for teachers or withdraw permission for  them to attend workshops or training.  </P> <P> To attract more substitutes, the district has increased its base pay from $75  to $85 per day.  </P> <P> Prospective substitute teachers do not need to have a teaching credential, but  must have a bachelor's degree. Although they are required to take the state's  teacher proficiency test, they may start teaching with an emergency credential  before the examination.  </P></p>

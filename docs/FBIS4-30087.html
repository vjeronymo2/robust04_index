			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- A Japanese Government panel  on Wednesday [22 June] proposed easing rules and regulations as  much as possible on safety and maintenance involved in electric  power generation while maintaining the current security level.    The government should pursue a new security policy on  electric power generation in response to the recent marked  increase in safety and maintenance levels amid a rapid  improvement in product quality, the Electricity Utility Industry  Council, an advisory organ to the trade minister, said.    In an interim report presented to International Trade and  Industry Minister Eijiro Hata, the council said the government's  direct involvement in security of power generation should be  reduced to a minimum necessary level.    How to maintain safety levels should thus basically be left  to decision by each power supplier, with emphasis put on the  principle of "self responsibility," the council said.    Government controls should be limited to prevention of  pollution and other areas that affect public safety, it said.    Consumers of electricity should also share responsibility in  maintaining security, the report said.    The council recommended further improvement in safety and  maintenance levels through new technology development.    Standardization of power generation facilities and equipment  should be promoted to upgrade overall security levels, it said.</p>

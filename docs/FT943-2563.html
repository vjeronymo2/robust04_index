			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Banks seek role in China unit trusts British fund management companies will this week press the Chinese government for permission to participate in introducing unit trusts to China as a means of reducing the volatility of share prices on local stock exchanges. A mission to China by British Invisibles, the cross-sector organisation which promotes invisible exports, is to seek access to the Chinese equity market for fund and management companies, including the asset management arms of UK banks and investment banks. The 30-strong delegation, which will give seminars on aspects of regulatory policy and financial practice in the City, will press for a more certain framework of financial law to give overseas institutions certainty that their contracts are binding. The mission is the sixth by British Invisibles since 1980 and comes amid a rapid growth in interest among financial institutions in gaining access to China. Foreign banks have previously not been allowed to gather local currency deposits or sell Chinese shares to local investors. Mr Robin Box, vice-chairman of Kleinwort Benson, the investment bank, said the Chinese government had accepted that the development of a unit trust industry would help to curb stock-market volatility by channelling the flow of retail investment. Mr Fox said banks and investment banks with fund management arms would try to persuade the government to allow them to take part in joint ventures with local companies. Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, said that the uncertainty of Chinese law limited investment in the country. Banks were made more reluctant to lend by the difficulty of obtaining legally binding covenants on loans. Mission leaders said they did not believe that UK companies were at a disadvantage because of disagreements between the UK and Chinese governments over Hong Kong. Mr Fox said that odd cases of discrimination had occurred where 'a local official did not want to create a rumpus'. Domestic share prices in China have fluctuated wildly this year. Events such as the government's statement that it would allow foreigners to invest in the 'A shares' that are currently restricted to local investors have sent share prices up by more than 60 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who is in  Washington, asked the United States to support the political  settlement to the Bosnian conflict proposed by Paris. He also  threatened to withdraw the 6,000 French peacekeeping forces from  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] if there is no prospect of a  political settlement.    Speaking at John Hopkins University, Alain Juppe said the  French plan envisions the gradual lifting of international  sanctions against Serbia once a cease-fire has been concluded  and territorial partition agreed on.    Alain Juppe told U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  there is no question of spending another winter in Bosnia.  Christopher remained very cautious. He reaffirmed that the aim  of the United States is to obtain a cease-fire and a renewal of  the peace talks between the two sides. We cannot predict  precisely what will come of it, he added.

			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> T-Bill Rates Fall: The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion of new three-month  bills at an average discount rate of 7.88%, down from 7.94% last week. Another  $7.2 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of  7.87%, down from 7.88% last week. The new discount rates understate the actual  return to investors -- 8.15% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling  for $9,800.80, and 8.31% for a six-month bill selling for $9,602.10. The  discount rate reflects the price discount received when government securities  are purchased at less than face value.  </P></p>

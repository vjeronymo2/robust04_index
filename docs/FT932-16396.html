			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Observer: Lucky for one The words of an anonymous reviewer in the late lamented Punch magazine should have come back to haunt him. Of the 30th Dick Francis thriller, Comeback, he or she wrote: 'A year without Dick Francis would be as unthinkable as a year without the Grand National'. Unthinkable? Certainly not to members of White's Club. Each year their National sweepstake includes the names of all the horses together with a race declared void ticket. This year a lucky punter won himself Pounds 9,000.</p>

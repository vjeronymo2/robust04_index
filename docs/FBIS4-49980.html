			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter: "China's Military Representatives </F> Secretly Visit Hong Kong"]    [Text] The Defense and Security Expert Group of the  Sino-British Joint Liaison Group is discussing the use of  military sites. An informed source has disclosed that if an  agreement can be reached on Friday, the Sino-British Airport  Authority is likely to resume its meeting on 17 May, a date  proposed by the British side, to resolve the pending new airport  financial arrangements.    At the ongoing meeting of the expert group, Chinese and  British representatives are holding discussions and hoping to  reach an agreement. As the main issues have been straightened  out, both sides are discussing the wording of the agreement.    Since early April this year, several groups of important  mainland People's Liberation Army [PLA] officials, including  representatives from the General Staff Department, the Navy, and  the 42d Group Army of the ground forces, have visited Hong Kong  to secretly inspect British military sites and gather  information first hand.    In late April, the CPC Central Military Commission held a  meeting to discuss stationing troops in the territory, to listen  to a report by an inspecting team from Hong Kong, and to ratify  the use of military sites.    The British side also received hints from the Chinese side  that it would be more flexible on the question of military sites  to resolve the resumption of the Airport Authority talks and the  fourth financial arrangements.    At the current meeting, both sides have narrowed their  differences mainly because the Chinese side has agreed to accept  14 major military sites for PLA use. In addition, another 25  military sites will be delivered to the special administrative  region [SAR] government for development. The earnings are  estimated to be HK$100 billion. Thus, the SAR Government will  have tangible financial reserves. The British side has promised  to repair and improve military facilities for use by the PLA.    Prior to this, the Chinese side had already indicated to the  British side that if the military sites issue could be smoothly  resolved, the Airport Authority could set the date for a  meeting. If such is the case, at a formal panel of the  Sino-British Joint Liaison Group at the end of this month both  sides can finalize the decisions of the Airport Authority and  the expert group concerning the new airport issue and military  sites.    The Chinese side wishes to resolve the military sites issue  as soon as possible, mainly because of heavy pressure from the  mainland military. With proper consolation provided for the  mainland military, the Chinese side will be able to take care of  pressure from the outside and resolve the new airport issue.    Because the new airport project has entered an important  stage, some franchised contracts have to be ratified. If China  and Britain cannot reach an agreement on the new airport  financial arrangements this will produce a major impact on the  new airport project.    It is learned that the Chinese side intends to discuss and  resolve the financial arrangements together with the draft  regulations for the new airport corporation, showing flexibility  on the former for the purpose of the British side's concessions  on the latter.</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE AND ITS EVICTION OF TENANTS  </P> <P> We reside in Arbol Verde in one of the houses owned by Claremont McKenna  College, and we believe that Kaplan's comments in no way describe accurately  the current situation  </P> <P> In our view, the houses owned by the college are the best maintained in the  entire neighborhood. Residents have known about the college's plans for its  property for at least three years.  </P> <P> Is this not ample notice for any landlord to give its tenants?  </P> <P> Of much greater concern to us and to dozens of other Arbol Verde residents is  the "destabilization" of the neighborhood caused by gang activity centered at  one of the few houses not owned by Claremont McKenna College. Drive-by  shootings have now resulted in injuries and a death; thus far the only  responsible concern that has been shown has been initiated by Claremont McKenna  College.  </P> <P> LINDA DAVID TAYLOR  </P> <P> JAMES D. TAYLOR  </P> <P> Claremont  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ulundi March 18 SAPA -- Zulu King Goodwill  Zwelithini on Friday [18 March] expressed regret that he was  unable to meet Nelson Mandela to clear the air between himself  and the African National Congress [ANC] leadership.    The Zulu monarch said he hoped there was no substance to  rumours of an attempt on Mr Mandela's life: "It would be rank  foolishness for anyone to attempt to do such a thing. A thing  like that would literally burn this country to ashes".    Friday's meeting between the two leaders was called off  after  the ANC said there were "firm reports" of a planned  assassination attempt on Mr Mandela. "I hope that is no more  than a scare story," said King Zwelithini.    "I would have liked to know from the president of the ANC  what he knows about the Zulu monarchy, Zulu sovereignty and the  kingdom of kwaZulu."    Addressing several thousand Zulu subjects in the kwaZulu  capital of Ulundi, King Zwelithini dismissed the ANC's  contention that the proposed meeting was initially arranged  intended to be closed.    He said kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi had  indicated in correspondence with the ANC's Jacob Zuma that the  meeting would be a "public discussion".    The king said he saw no reason why the meeting should have  been private. "I am sorry that Mr Mandela was unable to attend  today's meeting. I would have been grateful to know from him  why members of his organisation have insulted me almost daily in  radio programmes, speeches, and press statements."    King Zwelithini said he felt slighted by statements from Mr  Mandela and other ANC members that he was being prevented by Mr  Buthelezi from seeing Mr Mandela.    He said Mr Buthelezi had gone out of his way to ensure the  meeting went ahead, "even by breaking protocol in giving  unlisted telephone numbers to Mr Mandela".    The king said he had also been offended by the ANC's  attitude  to the kwaZulu legislative assembly [KLA]: "There can be no  action against the KLA without it being action against me as  reigning king".    Claims that Mr Buthelezi was his paymaster were offensive,  said the king, who referred to monarchies worldwide which were  supported by state funds. "What should be so exceptional about  the Zulu monarchy in this respect. Why does the ANC hurl these  insults at me?"    He said statements by ANC spokesmen that he supported the  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] were lies, saying he had not  attended a single Inkatha rally. Cultural gatherings which he  attended with Mr Buthelezi were alleged by the ANC and the media  to be IFP rallies, the Zulu monarch argued.    "I am sorry that the opportunity for the ANC to clarify  these  things in order to clear the air between me and its leadership  was lost because of the Mandela assassination scare."</p>

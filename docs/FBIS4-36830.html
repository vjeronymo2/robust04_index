			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent Ayman Mari'] </F>   [Excerpts] In the first meeting of its 13th ordinary  session, the People's Assembly listened to the statement of  Finance Minister Dr. Khalid al-Mahayini on the draft state  budget for fiscal year 1994.    The statement notes that the general state budget is one of  the most important tools of financial planning in view of its  role in creating new revenues and productive capabilities and  promoting the process of economic and social development.    The importance of the general state budget also lies in the  formation of the Gross Domestic Product [GDP] through public  spending, especially since most government expenditure on  investment and public consumption takes place through the state  budget. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Draft Budget Appropriations </H5>   The draft state budget's appropriations for 1994 reached  133.528 billion Syrian pounds, of which the sum of 66.181  billion pounds is for current expenditure and 67.644 billion  Syrian pounds is for investment expenditure.    The total appropriations in the 1994 budget are 8.78 percent  more than the total appropriations in the 1993 budget.    Initial estimates show that as a result of the increase in  the wages, annuities, and allowances for civil servants, the  appropriations in the 1994 draft budget of 1994 are expected to  rise to 142 billion pounds. This is in addition to the impact  of these increases in the budgets of the economic public sector,  administrative units, and awqaf departments.    The appropriations for investment operations in 1994 include  an appropriation to back the capital of certain public sector  firms by the sum of 350 million pounds.    We must point out that the job opportunities to be created  by  the public expenditure appropriations in the 1994 draft budget  are estimated at 70,376 jobs distributed as follows: 25,368 job  opportunities in the administrative sector and 30,008 job  opportunities in the economic sector. This is in addition to  approximately 15,000 job opportunities resulting from  implementing investment projects.  <H5>  Public Expenditure Appropriations: </H5>   A. The appropriations of the 1994 draft budget have been  distributed as follows:  <H5>  Wages, Remunerations and Allowances </H5>   The appropriations that have been allocated for wages,  remunerations, and allowances in the 1994 draft budget have  reached 19.282 billion pounds compared to 17.406 billion pounds  in 1993; in other words, an increase of 1.876 billion pounds or  an increase of 10.77 percent. The wages, remunerations, and  allowances constitute 29.13 percent of the total appropriations  for current expenditure in the 1994 draft budget.  <H5>  Administrative Expenditures </H5>   The appropriations of administrative expenditures in the  1994  draft budget reached 7.742 billion pounds compared to 6.387  billion pounds in the 1993 budget; in other words, an increase  of 1.355 billion pounds or 21.21 percent. Administrative  expenditures in the 1994 draft budget constitute 11.7 percent of  the budget.  <H5>  Transferable Expenditures </H5>   The appropriations for transferable expenditures have  reached  3.079 billion pounds compared to 2.627 billion pounds in 1993;  in other words, an increase of 452 million pounds or 17.2  percent.  <H5>  Debts and Obligations </H5>   The appropriations under this column in the 1994 draft  budget  are 5.465 billion pounds compared to 5.644 billion pounds; in  other words a reduction of 179 million pounds. The  appropriations under this column constitute 8.26 percent of the  total current expenditure appropriations in the 1994 draft  budget.   <H5>    Investment Projects </H5>   B. Appropriations for investment projects in 1994.    The 1994 investment plan has been drawn up on the basis of  several main considerations which can be summed up as follows:    -- Giving priority in investments in the 1994 budget to  electricity projects (generators, transformers, transport, and  distribution).    -- Concentrating on replacement and renovation projects in  existing intermediary industries in addition to new projects  which are ready to be contracted in this field.    -- Concentrating on irrigation and agrarian reform projects.    -- Continuing the emphasis on giving priority to  agricultural  projects, especially in research and productivity.    -- Concentrating on backing existing projects with the view  to completing and achieving tangible material progress in their  implementation, especially the projects on health, sewage,  drinking water, all stages of education, and automation in the  banking and insurance fields.    In light of the above, the appropriations for investment  projects in the 1994 draft budget have been fixed at a total sum  of 67.3 billion pounds distributed as follows:    -- 42.8 billion pounds or 63.6 percent of the total  appropriations will come from internal revenues.    -- 24.5 billion pounds or 36.4 percent of the total  appropriations will come from foreign revenues.    This is in addition to the investment expenditure of the  private and mixed sectors, the investment expenditure on  services contracts of companies which carry out exploration and  prospecting work and investment in oil and gas projects where  the total actual expenditure on these companies reached  $4.316293 billion until 31 December 1993. The planned  investment expenditure for 1994 is $478.793 million [dollar  figures as published]  <H5>  General Revenues-Internal and External </H5>   The internal revenues in the 1994 draft budget are estimated  at 97.926 billion pounds compared to 80.124 billion pounds in  the 1993 state budget; in other words, an increase of 17.802  billion pounds or 22.22 percent.    These estimates are expected to be increased by  approximately  7.1 billion pounds to reflect the recent wage increases from 1  May to 31 December 1994.    As for foreign revenues they were estimated at 24.53 billion  pounds compared to 31.868 billion pounds in the 1993 budget.    The following is a summary of the general revenues in the  draft budget:  <H5>  Current Revenues </H5>   The internal current revenue estimates are 77.611 billion  pounds compared to 61.344 billion pounds in the 1993 state  budget plus 9 billion pounds that are the aid funds estimates  for 1993.    The estimates of taxes and duties in the 1994 state budget  are 47.413 billion pounds compared to 36.309 billion pounds in  1993; in other words an increase of 11.104 billion pounds or an  average increase of 30.58 percent.  <H5>  Investment Revenues </H5>   The internal investment revenue estimates in the 1994 draft  budget are 20.315 billion pounds compared to 18.780 billion  pounds in the 1993 budget.    Foreign investment revenue estimates (loans and credit  facilities) in the 1994 draft budget are 24.53 billion pounds  compared to 22.868 billion pounds in the 1993 budget. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE KIDS  </P> <P> The wind is blowing, and there's a nip in the air. A bit too cold for an  oceanside hike, but the kids still need a place to vent their energy.  </P> <P> The solution? Think roller-skating.  </P> <P> "One of the things we do that's fun for the kids is called a flea hop to Top 40  music," said Lisa Camarillo, assistant manager of Skating Plus in Ventura.  "They skate around and do a jump and a skip, like dance steps. As far as the  kids are concerned, it's the thing to do."  </P> <P> Contrary to its Roller Derby image, roller-skating at the rink is not as  aggressive as some people think it is, rink owners say. They will also tell you  that on top of being a social sport, skating is good exercise.  </P> <P> "This is great fun for the kids," said R.F. Miller, owner of Roller Gardens in  Oxnard. "We keep them interested and moving."  </P> <P> On Saturdays and Sundays from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., Miller said, kids at the Roller  Gardens get a chance to play games such as the hokeypokey on wheels andto try  their luck rolling under the limbo stick.  </P> <P> Skating Plus finds a new approach to holding kids' interest. "We do a  bucket-of-money drop," Camarillo said. "We put money around on the floor, blow  a whistle and then they have a certain amount of time to collect it." Parents  are not encouraged to participate.  </P> <P> So what if your child -- or you, for that matter -- has never been on skates  before? Not to fear. Lessons are available.  </P> <P> Camarillo, whose daughter began taking lessons at age 2, said roller-skating  isn't difficult to learn, but the rate of mastery varies from person to person.  </P> <P> "A 5-year-old could learn well in two weeks, or a 10-year-old in six weeks. It  isn't so much a matter of age," she said, "as much as it is coordination."  </P> <P> Roller-skating isn't expensive -- the price of admission ranges from $2.75 to  $3.75 without skate rental. But one thing to keep in mind is that, if your  child likes it, there could be trouble down the road.  </P> <P> "Last year we qualified seven children for the national championships," Miller  said.  </P> <P> "If the kids get the bug and are competitive," he added, "just their skates  cost $500."  </P> <P>  Where to go: Skating Plus, 1728 Mesa Verde Ave. in Ventura, 656-2120; Skate  Palace, 451 W. Hueneme Road in Oxnard, 488-6444; Roller Gardens, 2731 Buckaroo  Ave. in Oxnard, 642-5380.  </P></p>

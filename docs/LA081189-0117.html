			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: BIG BANKS GO SERENADING;  </P> <P> LARGE INSTITUTIONS LAUNCH CAMPAIGNS TO WOO ACCOUNTS FROM SMALL FIRMS.  </P> <P> The days of small-business owners timidly approaching big bankers with hat in  hand appear to be over. Big banks are aggressively wooing small-business  owners, openly acknowledging that small business is where Southern California's  -- and the nation's -- real economic growth lies.  </P> <P> Bank of America, the state's largest bank, formed a small-business marketing  group last summer. The group created the "Small Business Alliance" program,  automatically enrolling about 340,000 small-business account holders in April.  Members can take advantage of discounted banking services such as payroll  services, a toll-free advice hot line, a quarterly newsletter, seminars and  reduced rates on products and services such as car rentals.  </P> <P> In response to B of A's marketing campaign, nearly every other major bank has  stepped into the fray, entering a market historically left to the smaller,  independent banks. This sudden interest in small-business clients amuses many  executives at smaller banks.  </P> <P> Ben Crowell, president and chief executive of Laguna Hills-based Eldorado  Bancorp, has been watching the marketing campaigns with interest.  </P> <P> "So far, we haven't seen any effect," said Crowell, who was one of the founders  of the 17-year-old bank, which has five branches in Orange County, two in  Riverside County and one in San Bernardino County. "We still feel as an  independent bank, we have closer ties to the smaller-business person than the  larger banks."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Neighborhood Banks Preferred  </P> <P> Crowell, whose bank has assets of about $250 million, said smaller banks  watched their loan business increase when the bigger banks began establishing  regional loan approval centers a few years ago. The rationale for such centers  was that loan losses could be reduced if lending authority was taken away from  the branches. But, Crowell said, small-business owners who were forced to  travel far and deal with more bureaucracy, instead turned to their small, local  bank for help.  </P> <P> Now it appears that the big banks have figured out that most small-business  owners prefer to deal with a neighborhood institution. And in response, the big  banks are sending more senior executives with lending authority back into the  branches.  </P> <P> "We want better and more experienced bankers to serve small-business owners,"  said Steve Carpenter, a former executive vice president at Wells Fargo who was  brought in as a vice chairman in charge of Security Pacific's new small- and  mid-sized business program, known as middle-market bank.  </P> <P> Under Carpenter's leadership, the new group is marketing a line of services to  companies with sales between $2 million and $25 million.  </P> <P> Carpenter said Security Pacific's branch executives will not only have loan  approval authority but will act as business consultants for their  small-business clients.  </P> <P> "The small-business person is a tough one to finance," Carpenter said. "We want  to make darn sure we pick bright people and marry them up to the right CPAs,  lawyers and partners."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Scores Open Every Day  </P> <P> Carpenter and his colleagues at other banks said they are anxious to tap into  the businesses that represent the real job growth in California.  </P> <P> He said there will probably not be any huge new aerospace companies moving into  town, but there are scores of new small businesses opening every day. (A recent  Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey revealed that nationwide, small businesses will  create 1.5 million new jobs this year -- accounting for 56.6% of the total 2.6  million jobs.)  </P> <P> To better reach these growing companies, First Interstate Bank of California  has six regional business banking centers, each serving as home to a team of  commercial lenders, according to Patricia Bracher, vice president and business  banking coordinator for First Interstate's Metro Los Angeles division.  </P> <P> "We figure there are about 21,000 companies with sales in the $1-million to  $10-million range in what we consider the metropolitan Los Angeles area,"  Bracher said.  </P> <P> She said First Interstate is following the lead of the independent banks "which  have done a superb job in relationship banking."  </P> <P> "We have the same approach, but we can offer a full range of services that an  independent bank cannot," Bracher said.  </P> <P> One new First Interstate product is a Business Advance Line, which is a secured  or unsecured line of credit ranging from $25,000 to $350,000. Business owners  can write checks on their credit line without having to apply for individual  loans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Executives Reassigned  </P> <P> Sanwa Bank California is also pursuing small-business clients but does not plan  to package the services, according to Margaret Merrett, vice president of  corporate communications.  </P> <P> "Many of our business services are geared toward the small-business person,"  said Merrett. Among them: a simplified pension plan, tax deferred retirement  plans and a full range of cash management services, including payroll and wire  transfers. Sanwa also provides courier service for non-cash items, she said.  </P> <P> At Union Bank, two executives have recently been reassigned to help clients  apply for Small Business Administration loan guarantees, according to spokesman  Mike Colwell.  </P> <P> "We have always paid attention to small-business owners," Colwell said. "They  have always been of major importance to us."  </P> <P> He said every one of Union's 167 branches has commercial lending authority,  which is a "real plus" for small-business clients who need a quick answer on  their loan requests. Meanwhile, Patricia Hudson, vice president in charge of  small-business marketing for the Bank of America, said the Alliance program has  been very well received.  </P> <P> "We see ourselves as a champion of small-business clients at the bank," Hudson  said. She said new services such as a free business banking analysis are not  only helping current customers but drawing in new ones.  </P> <P> "I'm so pleased with the branch support for all of this," Hudson said. She said  the branch managers are setting small-business sales goals and working hard to  meet them.  </P> <P> "Small-business clients tend to be among the most important clients at any  branch because they have deeper relationships with their bankers -- and they  usually have both their business and personal accounts in one place," Hudson  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Money Store Tops L.A. List of SBA Lenders  </P> <P> According to the Small Business Administration, the Money Store Investment  Corp. in Encino led the list of the largest SBA lenders in Los Angeles last  year. The Money Store funded 55 loans for a total of $17.4 million. Next in  line was Government Funding in Los Angeles, with 72 loans totaling $15.7  million. Three independent banks ranked third, fourth and fifth; Mechanics  National Bank in Paramount, Mercury Savings &amp; Loan in Glendale and Mid City  Bank in Los Angeles.  </P></p>

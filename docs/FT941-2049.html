			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Labour attacks publicity spending Labour yesterday attacked the amount being spent on publicity by the Education Department and called for the Commons public accounts committee to launch an inquiry. According to parliamentary answers given by the government Department for Education spending on publicity has increased from Pounds 103,000 in 1979-80 to Pounds 8.77m in the current financial year. It rose from Pounds 4.52m in 1990-91 to Pounds 8.88m in 1991-92. Television advertising started in 1990-91 at a cost of Pounds 1.1m with Pounds 800,000 spent the next year. Both the Parents' Charter - part of the Citizens' Charter initiative - and grant-maintained schools have been heavily publicised. Mrs Ann Taylor, who speaks for Labour on education, said the advertising was often 'factually incorrect, designed simply to prop up failing Conservative education policies'. The department's expenditure was 'a national scandal at a time when schools are crumbling and cannot afford to buy books'. It is government policy to encourage grant-maintained status, which requires schools to opt out of local authority control, but not to force them to do so. Mrs Taylor said: 'Having legislated to allow parents to choose whether their children's schools are locally-run or government-controlled, the department is spending millions putting only one side of the argument.' The department said the rise was caused by more information being distributed under the Parents' Charter.</p>

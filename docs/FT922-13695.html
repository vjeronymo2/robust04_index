			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Technology: FBI sets snare for hackers It's difficult to look natural while committing a computer crime. A sweaty brow or quickened heart beat is not going to give you away, but activities like logging on in the middle of the night or accessing a file that you normally have no interest in, may. For a year now, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation has been testing a new kind of security system which attempts to trap malicious computer users, or intruders masquerading as staff, by highlighting statistically-unusual behaviour. At present the system is confined to one IBM mainframe serving three or four field officers in the Washington DC area, but there are plans to extend it across the country. Over the next few years similar systems are likely to surface at other sensitive computer sites in government agencies, defence ministries and also the armed forces. The FBI's package, called Intruder Detection Expert System (Ides), has been developed over six years by SRI International of Menlo Park, California, with Dollars 2.5m (Pounds 1.5m) of funding, mainly from the US Navy. The software monitors individual users and groups of users and builds up a historical profile of their 'normal' behaviour on the computer. It then monitors their current activity, and sends out an immediate alert if there is a significant difference between the two. In this way Ides detects intrusions that go unnoticed by conventional password and access-control systems. For example, it can detect hackers who have gained access to a computer through exploiting unknown vulnerabilities. The FBI has uncovered some 'interesting events' says Teresa Lunt, programme director at SRI. 'Typically,' she says, 'they're concerned that a user might be providing information to someone on the street. An FBI employee who normally works on stolen cars, for example, might be contacted by a drug-related criminal and asked to look something up.' FBI cases tend to overlap departmental boundaries, says Lunt, so computer users may have the authority to access a wide range of files. With Ides, however, they will be asked to justify any unusual actions. Ides also includes a second kind of snare - it is able to recognise specific actions that are regarded as suspicious, such as a string of unsuccessful attempts at logging on. It achieves this with an expert or 'knowledge-based' system programmed to look for particular sets of circumstances. Hackers are predictable, says Lunt. 'There's a cookbook of ways to break into a Unix or Vax system for example - you can encode that information and look for those particular exploitations.' Lunt says the prototype Ides, which runs on a Sun workstation connected to the computer being monitored, may spawn a product within two to three years. The institute has funding for another three years of research but 'we think we can start turning out useful prototypes now,' says Lunt. SRI is not product-orientated but the research group is looking for a joint-venture partner to bring Ides to market.</p>

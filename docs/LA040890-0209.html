			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CRAWFORD'S TOWNSEND SUFFERS FIRST LOSS  </P> <P> While one was running out of gas, the other was running out of time.  </P> <P> In an opening game of the AA division of the Lions baseball tournament against  Crawford, USDHS pitcher Tom Shanner was pulled after the fifth inning with a  two-hit, four-strikeout effort to his credit, and USDHS leading, 2-1.  </P> <P> "For four innings he was OK," USDHS Coach Dick Serrano said, "then he ran out  of gas."  </P> <P> As Gavin Millay replaced Shanner, Crawford pitcher Chris Townsend, with an  undefeated high school pitching record on the line, was hoping something would  spark Crawford's offense.  </P> <P> Nothing did. In fact, sixth-ranked USDHS scored again in the sixth and held on  for a 3-1 victory Saturday morning at Valhalla.  </P> <P> Townsend, whose consecutive victory record was snapped at 13, had to adjust to  his first loss in two seasons.  </P> <P> "It's tough when pitch so well and end up losing," said Townsend (4-1), who had  seven strikeouts and gave up seven hits and three runs (one unearned). "We just  got beat, I don't really know what it was."  </P> <P> What it was, quite simply, was USDHS scoring the winning run in much the same  manner as Crawford had scored its only run at the top of the sixth.  </P> <P> After Shanner walked Sal Vidrios and Eric Brier with two outs, Vidrios scored  from second on a throwing error to first base by the USDHS shortstop. Shanner  got out of the inning on a force out at second.  </P> <P> "We only had one bad defensive play, and it cost us a run," Serrano said.  </P> <P> Two batters later -- Townsend struck out the first -- the Dons' Tom Tate  doubled to left field. Gary Remiker filed out to center, and Tate scored from  second to make it 2-1 when Crawford's shortstop overthrew first.  </P> <P> "We made a few crucial errors," Townsend said.  </P> <P> USDHS (11-3), which has lived, and won, by the one-, two- and three-run games  this season, was relieved to gets some key hits against Crawford (10-3).  </P> <P> "We got some timely hitting and some good defense," said Shanner (3-1).  </P> <P> Tate came out of a mild slump and went two for three, scored twice and had a  stolen base.  </P> <P> "I was seeing the ball pretty well today," Tate said. "(Townsend) pitched well,  but I just tried to relax and wait for the right pitch."  </P> <P> In the sixth, Tate drilled a shot to left field, stole second, stopped at third  on a single by Remiker, then scored on a fielder's choice when the throw home  was a fraction late.  </P> <P> In the first, Jeff Desjardins scored for USDHS on David Sanchez' RBI single.

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: BSN bid for Exor cleared by bourse BSN, the French food group, yesterday received the go-ahead from the Paris stock market authorities for its FFr6bn (Dollars 1bn) hostile bid for Exor, the French property company that controls Perrier mineral water. The BSN bid, unveiled in late February, offers FFr1,420 a share for Exor. It is a counter-bid against the FFr1,320-a-share offered last year by Ifint, a company controlled by the Agnelli family of Italy, once thought to be an ally of BSN. BSN has joined forces with Nestle, the Swiss food group which is one of its chief competitors, against the Agnellis in the battle for Perrier. Nestle is waiting to hear the results of a series of French court cases which are critical in determining the course of its FFr13.42bn hostile bid for Perrier. Last week, Exor and its allies, which include Saint Louis, the French sugar company, complied with a French stock market authority ruling by tabling a full bid for Perrier. The Exor camp, which already controls nearly 49 per cent of the mineral water company, made an unconditional offer at the same level of FFr1,475 a share offered by Nestle. The Exor camp is fighting against Nestle's attempt in the courts to freeze the voting rights on Exor's Perrier shares and to annul the recent sale of 13.8 per cent of Perrier to Saint Louis. The French police are now investigating suspected irregularities in the Saint Louis share sale. Perrier's shares yesterday rose to FFr1,531 from FFr1,517 when they returned to trading after suspension. Perrier is trading above the FFr1,475 a share offered by Nestle and Exor. Exor's shares fell to FFr1,490 from FFr1,495 when they resumed trading. The closing date for the pending bid by Ifint for Exor has been extended to April 23 from March 24, AP-DJ reports. Paris bourse authorities cited the recently accepted competing offer launched by BSN as the reason for the extension.</p>

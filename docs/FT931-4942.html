			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / People: Binks leaves CSI; Jones leaves Lloyds Abbey Life David Smith, the management consultant who masterminded the Isosceles bid for Gateway in 1989, is to become chief executive of Cannon Street Investments. Smith replaces Robin Binks, the man who first introduced the accountant and business consultant to CSI's board in September. The two met when Smith was trying to organise the bid for Gateway and Binks helped Isosceles to secure the finance for the bid. Binks, who was informed of the board's decision to replace him about two weeks ago, has been paid compensation believed to amount to a six figure sum. Tom Long, chairman of CSI, says the company is moving into a phase when operational skills would become more important: 'That is where David's skills lie.' Binks, a former merchant banker who joined CSI in November 1990, had been crucial to the group's debt reduction strategy involving the disposal or closure of several subsidiaries. Under his tenure, disposals included the flotation of Avonside, the housebuilder, the sale of 1.5m Betacom shares, and the laundry group, Stalbridge. CSI is now estimated to have debt of less than Pounds 35m, against a peak of Pounds 100m. ***** Gary Jones, marketing director of Lloyds Abbey Life since it was founded in 1988, is to leave the company at the end of this month. A spokesman for the company said that Jones, who joined Abbey Life in 1986 from the brewing and retailing division of Grand Metropolitan, was not moving to a specific job elsewhere, but had decided that he no longer wished to continue working in life assurance. Lloyds Abbey Life does not intend to appoint a replacement in the short term, but will divide his responsibilities between the company's different divisions.</p>

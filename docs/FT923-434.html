			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Rational roads IS TRANSPORT in Europe too cheap? Try asking the Swiss, reluctantly embarking on one of the biggest rail projects of the century. The cost of building two train tunnels totalling nearly 50 miles on a north-south axis under the Alps is put at SFr14.9bn (Pounds 6.7bn), but finance charges and inflation are likely to push the final figure to a colossal SFr24bn. The Swiss themselves will derive little benefit from the project: the trains' main function is to give piggy-back rides to the heavy volumes of road traffic making the trans-Alpine journey between Germany and Italy. Up till now Switzerland has sought to protect its fragile Alpine environment by refusing access to vehicles weighing more than 28 tonnes, but the country's moves towards membership of the European Community have obliged it to open up a trans-Alpine route for the 40-tonne juggernauts at present taking alternative routes through Austria and France. In a rational world, the cost of the tunnels would be borne by those for whom they are being built - their users. The world of transport, however, operates differently. Although users of the Alpine tunnels will be charged a fee, it cannot be a large one because transit traffic would simply revert to cheaper, more environmentally damaging, routes. Consequently, few (if any) of the Swiss taxpayers faced with the bill for building the tunnels will live long enough to see the project's revenues cover its costs. The case of Switzerland's Alpine tunnels is symbolic of the transport difficulties facing a unifying European market. New patterns of transnational trade are putting increasing strains on both transport infrastructure and the environment. The combination of cheap road transport and a relaxation of border controls has opened up tempting opportunities to exploit quite narrow price differentials across national frontiers: one apocryphal story tells of a vegetable producer growing potatoes in Germany, sending them across the Alps for peeling and processing in Italy, then bringing them back to Germany for packing and distribution. There is no case for seeking to restrict such cross-border trade. On the contrary, an efficient market should encourage it. What is open to question, however, is whether a market can be regarded as efficient if participants are relieved from the obligation to meet the costs they impose on others. Governments and taxpayers, particularly those bearing the increasingly heavy cost of transit traffic, are unlikely to be able to fund the provision of either the transport infrastructure or the environmental protection necessary to cope with forecast rate of traffic growth: nor should they be expected to do so. Instead, a common EC transport policy should have at its heart what at present it so badly lacks: an intelligible system of charging road users not just the full cost of providing the infrastructure they use, but a sum reflecting the cost to the environment of preferring this mode over less damaging ones. It may well be that it makes sense to transport lorry loads of potatoes across the Alps and back to be peeled: but until a rational system of charging for road use is in place, it will be impossible to know.</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Fall in VAT registrations highlights recession's toll THE Department of Trade and Industry yesterday announced an unprecedented net decrease in the number of businesses registered for value added tax last year, indicating the recession's heavy toll among small businesses. The stock of VAT registered businesses declined last year for the first time since records began in 1979, according to DTI figures. It reported a net decrease of 41,000 businesses, equivalent to about 2.5 per cent of the stock of 1.64m VAT registered businesses at the beginning of last year. The department said there were 189,000 new registrations last year, equivalent to 12 per cent of the stock of businesses at the start of the year, and 230,000 deregistrations, amounting to 14 per cent of the stock. While there were small net increases in the number of businesses in wholesaling, finance, property and professional services, the number of VAT registered businesses in construction fell by 21,000 or 9 per cent of that sector. There were small declines in the number of businesses in the agricultural, transport, retail, catering and motor trades. The number of businesses declined in all regions last year, except for Northern Ireland. The DTI stressed that its figures did not measure births and deaths of businesses but indicated trends in the size of the small business population. Registration for VAT is mandatory when turnover reaches Pounds 37,600 a year.</p>

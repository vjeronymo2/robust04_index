			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INDIA TO BEGIN WITHDRAWING ITS TROOPS FROM SRI LANKA TODAY  </P> <P> India and Sri Lanka on Friday defused a potentially bloody crisis in an  11th-hour agreement to begin withdrawing 45,000 Indian army troops from the  island today, the deadline Sri Lanka had set for all troops to leave its  war-torn northern regions.  </P> <P> The two countries, separated by just 21 miles of water off India's southern  tip, also agreed to begin discussions in New Delhi today on a timetable for a  complete troop pullout.  </P> <P> As the two governments were involved in intensive negotiations to resolve the  conflict, rioting broke out in the central city of Kandy. About 130  demonstrators were killed when police opened fire during anti-Indian rallies  that took place despite a strict nationwide curfew, military officials said  today.  </P> <P> No violence was reported in the capital city of Colombo, which has resembled a  ghost town since the curfew went into effect at midnight Thursday.  </P> <P> Many other civilians reportedly were killed elsewhere in the countryside, where  the Sinhalese insurgent movement, the People's Liberation Front, is growing in  strength, in part by encouraging nationalist hatred for the Indian  "peacekeeping force."  </P> <P> In a speech to his nation of 16 million Friday night, Sri Lankan President  Ranasinghe Premadasa called India's pledge "an exemplary action," and Aftab  Seth, a Foreign Ministry spokesman in New Delhi, hailed the agreement as "the  victory of reason."  </P> <P> However, the accord stopped far short of Premadasa's demand last month that  India remove by today all troops it sent to Sri Lanka two years ago in an  ill-fated effort to put down an uprising by Sri Lanka's minority Tamil  community.  </P> <P> India, which helped train and arm the Tamils in the early 1980s, had been asked  to dispatch the troops by Premadasa's predecessor.  </P> <P> Premadasa, a professed nationalist whose popularity has waned since his  election last year, stunned India on June 1 with his unilateral withdrawal  demand, which was publicly rejected by Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.  </P> <P> But the Sri Lankan president also indicated he is aware that the diplomatic  tussle with India, a nation with an army 50 times larger than his, is hardly  his major problem.  </P> <P> During his speech Friday night, Premadasa called on his nation to launch "a  massive peace effort" to quell a second and far more threatening  counterinsurgency by the island's Sinhalese ethnic majority.  </P> <P> "By resorting to strikes and various destructive activities . . . we are  causing damage and great harm to ourselves," Premadasa said. About 40 people  are killed each day in the conflict on this once-idyllic island, where the  economy now is crippled.  </P> <P> Despite the appeal, independent analysts and diplomats said Premadasa's  seven-month-old government clearly showed signs Friday of increasing  desperation.  </P> <P> In signing the agreement, Premadasa backed down from almost all his original  demands of India. And, to keep peace on the streets Friday, he was forced to  impose a strict, 54-hour curfew on the entire country.  </P> <P> "Premadasa may have saved a bit of face in signing this agreement today," said  one Western diplomat who asked not to be named. "But, for him, the real crisis  is still right in his own backyard. Now that he's settled with the Indians, he  must face his own people. And that's a problem that won't go away so easily."  </P></p>

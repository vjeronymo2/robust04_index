			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Southern Africa harnesses SADC as engine for growth South Africa's Deputy President Thabo Mbeki yesterday handed over the country's new flag to Southern Africa Development Conference chairman Sir Ketumile Masire in Gaberone, Botswana, in a gesture that marked the start of a new era for the entire region. The formal accession of South Africa to the now 11-member SADC means that the organisation, originally devoted to reducing its members' links to their southern neighbour, is now regarded as the vehicle with the best chance of driving the region towards growth. The shift follows years during which SADC has been politically opposed to, but dependent on, South Africa. This spirit of co-operation between South Africa and SADC was by no means guaranteed. While most of the world rejoiced at the success of South Africa's elections earlier this year, the broader southern African community viewed the transition to democracy with mixed feelings. Although justifiably proud at their contribution to the overthrow of apartheid, many in the region feared that the African National Congress, once in power, might forget its debts, while South Africa's re-emergence on the global stage would divert much-needed aid and investment from its poorer neighbours. But, despite such concerns, the new South African government has placed regional co-operation at the forefront of its emerging foreign policy. In parliament two weeks ago, Mr Alfred Nzo, foreign minister, made clear that promoting good relations with other southern African states would be a priority. 'South Africa will actively encourage the movement to create a new form of political and economic interaction in southern Africa,' he said, while stressing his support for a new regional security mechanism that would complement SADC's economic activities. The new approach is a marked contrast to South Africa's previous policies. As the unquestioned regional superpower under former President PW Botha, the South African regime unabashedly used its economic and military might to prevent its black-run neighbours from successfully uniting in opposition to South Africa or helping to provide aid to the liberation movement. By helping to foment civil wars in Angola and Mozambique and showing little hesitation in launching cross-border military strikes to try to destroy ANC bases in other countries, South Africa garnered a well-deserved reputation as regional bully. It was in response to such activities that South Africa's neighbours formed SADC's precursor, the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC), in 1980. Despite its admirable aims, however, SADCC proved unable to meet its objective of reducing its members' trade with South Africa. Not only did nearly all its members actually expand their economic relationship with South Africa over the past decade; few of the organisation's initiatives to improve regional infrastructure yielded any fruit. Now, however, the situation has changed drastically. Recognising the wider impact of political change in South Africa, the body renamed itself SADC in 1992, changing its primary focus from opposition to South Africa to economic development. And, with South Africa now a fully integrated member, the organisation is optimistic that it will finally be able to succeed in its goals. Yesterday's SADC summit was preceded by a two-day meeting of regional trade ministers and it is through trade that the main thrust of economic development is planned. Recognising the need to establish competitive, export-oriented industries, SADC intends to devote itself to the establishment of a regional trade treaty which will ultimately allow the free movement of goods, services and capital across all member states. However, most of the region's economies maintain complex trade and tariff regulations which will take a long time to dismantle. In addition, the relative size of South Africa - it contributes over 75 per cent to a regional GDP of around Dollars 125bn (Pounds 80.6bn) - makes other countries nervous of being flooded with cheaper South African goods should all restrictions be removed. Thus many observers feel that any short-term benefits flowing from a restructured SADC are likely to be political rather than economic. 'I can't see SADC successfully turning itself into a free trade area in the immediate future, but there is significant potential for the grouping, under South African leadership, to play the role of regional peacemaker,' says Mr Chris Landsberg, a foreign policy specialist at Johannesburg's Centre for Policy Studies. Acknowledging this possibility, the Frontline States organisation (a political grouping comprising all SADC members except Malawi, Lesotho and Swaziland and also originally designed to thwart South Africa) has decided to restructure itself into the political and security wing of SADC. It to play the role of mediator in regional conflicts. The scope for such activities has been demonstrated over the past week as SADC members have taken a stand to try to restore democracy to Lesotho after its king illegally dismissed the elected government. South African President Nelson Mandela has also played a role in helping to resolve remaining disagreements ahead of the planned Mozambican elections. Whether any of these initiatives, political or economic, prove successful remains to be seen. However the fact remains that, for the first time since most of SADC's members achieved independence, there is hope that, with South Africa at the forefront, the region might at last be able to reverse its economic decline.</p>

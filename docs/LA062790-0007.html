			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> On Broadway: A consortium of New York theater community members joined together  Tuesday to form a plan to reduce ticket prices and costs so that more plays can  be produced on Broadway. The plan, which will become effective Sept. 1, was  announced in a New York press conference by the League of American Theaters and  Producers, and the three major theater operating organizations -- Jujamcyn,  Nederlander) and Shubert, as well as representatives from several unions and  guilds. By reducing salaries and royalty payments, one-act plays with small  casts can be produced for $400,000 under the plan, and offered to the public at  prices ranging from $10 to $24.

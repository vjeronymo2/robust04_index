			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIDEOTAPED INTERVIEWS IN MCMARTIN CASE HIT  </P> <P> Thirty-three witnesses and five months into its phase of the McMartin  Pre-School molestation trial, the defense has launched what one attorney termed  "the most crucial aspect of our case" -- an attack on videotaped interviews  conducted with alleged child victims before charges were filed nearly five  years ago.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys Tuesday concluded their questioning of clinical psychologist  Michael P. Maloney, who told the jury that the controversial interviews with  the children, conducted by Children's Institute International (CII) in late  l983 and early 1984 and heavily relied upon by prosecutors, used improper  techniques that may have "contaminated" the youngsters' later accounts of what  occurred at the Manhattan Beach nursery school.  </P> <P> One 9-year-old boy, for example, "in the early parts (of his interview) states  he didn't know who Ray Buckey was" but by the end "was talking about him in a  very direct fashion regarding specific (sexual) behaviors," Maloney noted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Molestation Charges  </P> <P> Buckey, 30, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, are charged with 65 counts  of molestation and conspiracy.  </P> <P> Maloney, testifying for the defense over the last two weeks, repeatedly  criticized the interviewers at CII, a Los Angeles child abuse diagnostic and  treatment center. He said they should have let the interviews progress  according to the children's spontaneous comments, but instead talked more than  the youngsters and utilized a sort of script that may have resulted in false  accusations.  </P> <P> "In a way these kids were all machined right through the same process," Maloney  testified under direct examination by defense attorney Dean Gits. "Toward the  end of that process they were being asked very direct and almost coercive  questions about sexual behavior. At those times, some of the children became  fairly nonverbal and reverted to simply pointing and did so in a somewhat  passive way and then sometimes even in a questioning way."  </P> <P> The nine children who have testified against the Buckeys during the 2-year-old  trial were among several hundred interviewed and physically examined at CII.  </P> <P> The interviews began when the Los Angeles County district attorney's office  asked a social worker there to evaluate several children. But as word of the  investigation leaked and spread, parents whose children had attended the  nursery school flocked to the center to have their children assessed for  possible sexual abuse.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Charges Dropped  </P> <P> Scores of children eventually were diagnosed as having been victimized, but  many parents refused to allow their children to testify and Dist. Atty. Ira  Reiner ultimately dropped charges against five of the seven teachers who had  been ordered to stand trial after an 18-month preliminary hearing.  </P> <P> Prosecutors, who began their cross-examination of Maloney late Tuesday, have  admitted that the early interviews were flawed, but have defended the  children's testimony as truthful.  </P> <P> Maloney, the first expert witness called by the defense, testified that he was  paid $35,000 to analyze the videotapes made by CII. He said he detected 17  aspects of a "script" used by all three of the center's interviewers that,  perhaps inadvertently, fed information to the children:  </P> <P> The interview usually began with the child drawing a person and identifying  body parts, with an emphasis on sexual organs. So-called anatomically correct  naked dolls were then introduced, again with a focus on their sexual parts.  Class photographs were shown to the children to jog their memories and they  were told that others had already described abuses. They then were given  puppets to use as mouthpieces enabling them to tell "yukky secrets" to a  "secret machine," a tape recorder.  </P> <P> The children were also told that other children had been scared by Ray Buckey,  Maloney said. He said the interviewers referred to sneaky, tricky, naked games,  implied that Ray Buckey was a bad person under surveillance by police and  eventually moved into specific questions about sexual acts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Allegedly Were Led  </P> <P> "Those items were almost in every case that we end up with here," Maloney said,  asserting that the questioning led the children to believe that something bad  must have happened at the school and that, if they were "smart," they would  tell about it too.  </P> <P> The psychologist, who is highly respected and frequently consulted by both  prosecutors and defense attorneys in child sexual abuse cases, also said the  interviews indicate that the children had already received information about  the investigation from parents, brothers and sisters, and friends, putting  additional pressure on them.  </P> <P> Attorney Gits, who represents Peggy McMartin Buckey, said outside the  courtroom, that "the essential thing Dr. Maloney has established is that these  children came out of CII different from what they went in," and that the  interviews served more as "a teaching, training mechanism" than as an unbiased  attempt to gather information about what each child had actually experienced.  </P> <P> But, without giving specifics, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William  Pounders said outside the jury's presence that he was "very disappointed in  Maloney's testimony." The judge said that although the witness "has drawn out  17 supposed reasons why the system was bad," he found them "inadequate."  </P> <P> Pounders said he had even done research "as to my ability to strike this kind  of testimony. That's how bad it has been."  </P></p>

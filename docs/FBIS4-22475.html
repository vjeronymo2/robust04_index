			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irina Vladykina: "One Hundred Sixty Candidates </F> for the Sverdlovsk Oblast Duma Named--Election Campaign Begins  in the Local Mass Media"]    [Text] One hundred sixty candidates for deputy to the  Sverdlovsk Oblast Duma have obtained their credentials. In the  oblast administration, where a meeting took place between  candidates for deputy and head of administration Aleksey  Strakhov and members of the government, it was learned that of  32 public associations declaring their intention to begin the  election campaign, six have dropped out.    Some 227 candidates submitted applications during the course  of the preelection period, indicating the high activity level of  social and political forces in Sverdlovsk Oblast. According to  preliminary estimates of the oblast electoral commission, oblast  residents will receive a ballot 10 April containing the names of  at least 30 candidates for deputy to the oblast Duma. A great  deal of attention is therefore devoted to the interaction  between candidates and the mass media. Lots were drawn on  Sverdlovsk television, where candidates were afforded free air  time for their presentations, and also in OBLASTNAYA GAZETA, the  official organ of the Sverdlovsk Oblast administration, where  space will be allocated for the publication of free campaign  materials. Candidates are being afforded the full use of seven  issues of this publication, beginning 25 March.    Among the registered candidates for deputy to the oblast  Duma  are 44 businessmen, 33 political figures nominated by parties,  five trade union functionaries, four workers, and four  unemployed individuals. The work of nominating and registering  candidates is not complete. The oblast electoral commission is  presently investigating complaints and petitions, of which quite  a number have been received.</p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Ferruzzi Fights Liquidation Order: Citing possible harm to the public, U.S.  District Judge James Zagel denied a request for a temporary injunction by  Ferruzzi Trading International SA and Ferruzzi USA Inc. to block a Chicago  Board of Trade order that is forcing the firm to sell a huge quantity of  soybean futures. The lawsuit sought the restraining order and a permanent  injunction against the exchange's directive. Published reports have said the  firm was the object of the directive because it was trying to corner the  soybean market -- something Ferruzzi denies.  </P></p>

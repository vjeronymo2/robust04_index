			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> Carol Vena-Mondt uses old junk store black-and-white family-photo Christmas  cards as springboards for large painted family portraits. Using only the bluish  grays and whites of faded photos or those first '50s TV screens that aired "The  Ed Sullivan Show," she duplicates postwar families oozing with the prosperity  and down-home propriety that briefly marked life before Sen. McCarthy and  Korea.  </P> <P> "The Hennings" are here, for example, with their goofy, spectacled mom and pop  and a brood of progeny that only a parent could love. Exaggerating and  distorting features with deep dark shadows, Vena-Mondt selectively turns period  portraits into universal Rorschach tests onto which we graft a history: Is that  a flicker of Oedipal defiance in the teen-age son who refuses to pose just like  Daddy? Comedic and grotesque, these Middle Americans unwittingly invite us to  glimpse the dark drama behind all our post-card greetings.  </P> <P> Judie Bamber's lonely painted objects interact with potent titles to produce a  loud, mysterious echo. Two small paintings are called "Excuse Me for Living."  On the left is a lustrous gumdrop casting shadows on a bright, flat ground; on  the right it is squished, its liquid contents spilling like viscera. Shiny and  pristine as a Japanese koi study, "Oh Come On It Doesn't Hurt That Much" is a  teeny, frail and very dead goldfish. Bamber's combination of damaged objects,  loaded titles and seductive technique gets us thinking about personal  vulnerability and the politics of intimacy, themes that become overt in the wry  feminist statement "Closeness Is Easier When You Are Far Away."  </P> <P> Finally, Tony Greene builds on photos of nude male torsos and museum dioramas  of "real" (stuffed) forest animals in "natural" habitats. He embeds these in  thick, honey-hued varnishes and paints decorative florals around and through  them, toying with distinctions between nature and artifice, fake and real. In  "His Broken Lines," traces of an erotic male torso entwined with baroque thorns  hints at crucifixion and the idea that religion and art bear the same proxy  relationship to genuine passion that a stuffed deer bears to a romping doe.  (Jan Baum, 170 S. La Brea Ave., to June 3.). MARLENA DONOHUE  </P></p>

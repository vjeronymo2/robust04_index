			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> TUNING IN TO THE WIT OF A RADIO COMIC  </P> <P> Fred Allen: His Life and Wit by Robert Taylor (Little, Brown: $19.95, 340 pp.,  illustrated)  </P> <P> Call it the Pagliacci effect: the process by which a comedian's life becomes  anything but comic. Fred Allen, whose particular kind of verbal wit is an  endangered species driven almost to extinction by television's broader, coarser  visual effects, was a phenomenon of the Golden Age of radio, a time when being  funny was done with words.  </P> <P> To excel at that, a comedian didn't need to look peculiar, use foul language or  live flamboyantly. He could wear banker's gray, actually use "Good Heavens" as  a tag line, remain happily married, deeply religious and almost excessively  modest in his personal habits. Television ended all that virtually overnight,  and Fred Allen stopped being a household word and became an instant  anachronism. His kind of humor didn't cross over. There wasn't enough to see.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nothing Well-Done  </P> <P> "The reason why television is called a medium is because nothing on it is ever  well-done," Allen quipped, but his caustic comments didn't help matters. The  American public was infatuated with the tube, and couldn't have cared less what  a disillusioned radio comic thought of it. Those were the days, remember, when  people watched test patterns through the magnifying glass over the 7-inch  screen, when they traded in the piano for a TV.  </P> <P> A technological casualty, Allen wrote his memoir, called it "Treadmill to  Oblivion," and outlived his era by a scant six years, dying in his early '60s.  According to his biographer, " 'Treadmill' broke all records for a book on  radio," but Allen wasn't comforted. "I'm appearing on TV and radio shows for  nothing, speaking to motley groups of antique ladies, and going from  door-to-door with my tome in my hand trying to stimulate the sale." A comedown?  It was an expulsion from Eden.  </P> <P> Taylor, a veteran Boston art and book critic, clearly has the warmest regard  and admiration for his subject, consistently treating Allen with respect and  affection. Unfortunately, Taylor's rigid and often tortured prose style seems  completely at odds with Allen's easy colloquial wit. Taylor tends to favor  strange, recherche forms of ordinary words -- fatidic for significant;  estivated for spent the summer. He leaves no noun or verb unmodified, as if a  naked word could be guilty of indecent exposure. Often the syntax becomes so  entangled that reading the book is like finding one's way out of the Hampton  Court maze.  </P> <P> Let Allen have the last word. "All the comedian has to show for his years of  work and aggravation is the echo of forgotten laughter" -- the original source  of which Taylor lavishly quotes in this belabored but generous tribute.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> WHAT CHANGE IN FILM RATING SYSTEM MEANS;  </P> <P> MOVIES: ADULT-THEMED FILMS CAN NOW BE MADE AND MARKETED WITHOUT THE STIGMA OF  THE X.  </P> <P> When pornographers took the Motion Picture Assn. of America's adults-only X  rating, multiplied it by three ("XXX!!!) and made it the beacon for fans of  love stories without love, they gave MPAA President Jack Valenti's voluntary  movie ratings system a flat tire. On Wednesday, after a decade of controversy,  prodding and a couple of lawsuits, Valenti got out and changed the tire.  </P> <P> The X rating is now called NC-17. Same category, same meaning -- no children  under 17 admitted -- but without the taint. Filmmakers can now make movies with  adult themes aimed at adult audiences, and distributors will be able to market  them.  </P> <P> "We are going back to the original intent of the rating system," Valenti said  Wednesday morning. "We have an adults-only category and anybody who wants to go  see (an NC-17-rated) film can go see it, period. It takes us back to the days,  hopefully, of 'Midnight Cowboy,' 'Last Tango in Paris' and 'Clockwork Orange.'  "  </P> <P> You can quibble about the time it took Valenti to repair the system that he  designed and installed 22 years ago. A lot of serious adult-themed films have  been butchered because distributors couldn't book X-rated movies in theaters  and because newspapers and television stations refused advertising for them.  Ken Russell's "Crimes of Passion," Alan Parker's "Angel Heart" and William  Friedkin's "Cruising" are just three that got caught up in public  controversies; scores more were ignominiously edited down to Rs because their  directors were contractually obligated to do so.  </P> <P> Studios can still insist on R clauses in their contracts with filmmakers, but  they can no longer use the excuse that they're necessary. The X, useful as a  symbol for railroad crossings and Pussycat Theaters, is now about as relevant  to the American film industry as the skull and crossbones it came to represent.  </P> <P> There have been two changes in the ratings system since 1968. In 1984, a  firestorm of protest over the violence in Steven Spielberg's PG-rated "Indiana  Jones and the Temple of Doom" (you may recall a beating heart being ripped from  a man's chest?) forced the MPAA to come up with the PG-13. The PG-13 was more a  public-relations gesture than a necessity; it merely advised parents that PG-13  films contained stronger content than those rated PG. The NC-17 does nothing  less than remove a system of censorship from one of the world's most popular  art forms.  </P> <P> The MPAA made another adjustment in the ratings system Wednesday, and it's a  good one. From now on, the Ratings Board will provide explanations for its  decisions on films that are rated R and will provide those explanations to  theater owners and to most of the nation's film critics.  </P> <P> Critics should provide their readers and viewers with information about the  content of films, and many do. They can now use the MPAA explanations, or  provide their own, or use the MPAA judgments as departure points for debate. It  will all be to the benefit of parents deciding which films are appropriate for  their children and -- let's face it, adults use the ratings as much for their  own choices as for their kids' -- the additional information will influence our  viewing habits, too.  </P> <P> Whether the changes announced Wednesday will continue to neutralize the  passions of would-be community censors remains to be seen. Certainly, the ban  on advertising for X-rated films will not apply to the NC-17 rating at major  newspapers and television stations; The Times and the New York Times have both  published editorials calling for ratings revisions. At the same time, it is  inevitable that someone will submit a film for an NC-17 rating that contains  scenes repugnant to most people and blue noses will begin to twitch and itch.  </P> <P> But the rating system, restored to its original intent, is the right one in a  free society. It is voluntary, it is easy to understand, and it does not place  an arbitrary cap on how far films can go. As Valenti said Wednesday, if  pornographers make a comeback in theaters (it's almost exclusively a video  business now), why would they pay the MPAA to give it an NC-17 when the X tells  all?  </P> <P> Arguments will still arise over ratings given to specific films, and over the  comparative content of films given the same ratings. Members of the Ratings  Board still have to get a better sense of balance between the nature of  violence and sexuality in films; critics have maintained, with plenty of  evidence, that tougher standards are applied to sexuality than to mayhem.  </P> <P> Those arguments, however frustrating to the participants, are healthy and  unavoidable in dealing with something as subjective as popular taste. To have  no ratings system at all would be a disaster; Hollywood would be editing  different versions of films for counties, boroughs and parishes, and for the  tastes of leaders of the religious, parent or government bodies that would  breed -- as surely as mosquitoes in swamp water -- in each of them.  </P> <P> Valenti made the right decision in rejecting the suggestion of some critics and  directors that a new adults-only rating be inserted between the R and the X.  His argument was that it would force the rating board members to decide when  films were pornographic and when they were not, and he's right. Two adults-only  ratings are not necessary anyway. If children can't get in, adults ought to be  able to take care of themselves.  </P> <P> The immediate future of the ratings system, perhaps on the verge of collapse  just two days ago, is now in the hands of theater operators. The fact that they  defaulted on their promise to enforce the R rating, which originally assured  parents their under-17 kids couldn't get in without adult accompaniment, has  done almost as much to cripple the system as the pornographers.  </P> <P> Now they are being asked, and they have agreed, to enforce an adults-only  rating. That means slowing traffic at the door long enough to check IDs when  NC-17 films are being shown, and -- here's the hard part -- turning down  admission money from those who are too young. The integrity of the system, and  the newly regained freedom of filmmakers, may hang in the balance.  </P></p>

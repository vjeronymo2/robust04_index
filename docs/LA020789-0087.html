			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. PROBES FASTENER MAKER IN CHATSWORTH;  </P> <P> FBI LOOKING INTO TEST DATA SUPPLIED BY VSI  </P> <P> Federal agents spent nearly 48 hours this weekend searching VSI Aerospace  Products in Chatsworth, a unit of Fairchild Industries, in connection with a  criminal investigation into improper testing of nuts, bolts and rivets that the  company produces for aircraft.  </P> <P> An agent at the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Seattle, where the  investigation is headquartered, said the search of VSI was seeking evidence  that the company supplied "false test data" for fasteners.  </P> <P> The fasteners, which are sold under the original company name Voi-Shan, are  used various military and commercial passenger aircraft. Some of the products  include high-strength cadmium-plated fasteners that require sophisticated tests  to ensure that they meet detailed technical requirements for aerospace  products.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Declined Comment  </P> <P> Allegations against Voi-Shan include a report that the company supplied test  data for its products that indicated they were examined by "inspector No. 11."  An FBI agent said, "It is alleged that there is no inspector No. 11."  </P> <P> A spokesman for Fairchild, which is based in Chantilly, Va., declined to  comment. Local company executives declined comment as well.  </P> <P> Federal agents arrived at the company's Chatsworth facility at 4:45 p.m. Friday  and did not leave until 3:30 p.m. Sunday. They reportedly brought along  computer equipment to log documents that they were taking.  </P> <P> The task force of federal agents also included representatives of the Naval  Investigative Service, the Air Force's Office of Special Investigations, the  Defense Criminal Investigative Service and the Internal Revenue Service.  </P> <P> The involvement of IRS agents suggests that financial irregularities may also  be under investigation, but the FBI declined to comment on the scope of the  investigation. An FBI agent declined to identify the person or persons making  the allegations.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: PACIFIC PALISADES;  </P> <P> PARK VISITOR CENTER STUDIED  </P> <P> State parks officials are considering a plan to build a 12,000-square-foot  visitor center at Will Rogers State Historic Park, a state parks official said  this week.  </P> <P> "It is strictly in the talking stage at this point, but we expect we may have a  proposal by April or May," said George Rackelman, a parks department official  who is helping put together a general plan for the park.  </P> <P> The visitor center is among several possible improvements being considered by a  team of parks officials and volunteer docents. Other proposals include  additional parking, an improved road into the park and construction of new  restrooms, he said.  </P> <P> The park is the former ranch of the late humorist Will Rogers. It was donated  to the state in 1944 upon the death of Rogers' widow. Besides a ranch house,  the park includes stables, a polo field, picnic area and nature trails.  </P></p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: HK Futures Exchange plans contracts on two stocks The Futures Exchange of Hong Kong yesterday announced plans to introduce futures contracts on two of the colony's biggest stocks, HSBC Holdings and Hong Kong Telecommunications. The announcement sparked an immediate confrontation with the stock exchange, which had only been informed of the launch the previous day. The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the colony's watchdog, approved the product and further agreed to honour the futures exchange's request for confidentiality 'in view of the overriding public interest for ensuring that Hong Kong remains the primary market for trading Hong Kong-related financial products.' This meant there was no public consultation. However, the SFC conceded that as well as competing with markets around the world, the two Hong Kong exchanges are in competition with each other. The stock exchange, which itself plans to introduce traded options on equities in the second half of next year, attacked the decision to do away with market consultation, especially given the worldwide perception that equities futures are high risk products. A spokesman for the stock exchange said: 'We had the experience in 1987 on futures products and the introduction of such a product (equity futures) would possibly increase volatility on the underlying stock, so we think the market should have been consulted.' Hong Kong has spent much of the post-1987 years rebuilding its international repute following the crash, which was exacerbated by a run on Hang Seng Index futures in the run-up to October and which saw brokers default to the tune of HKDollars 1.8bn (USDollars 233m), compared with a guarantee fund of HKDollars 22m. Mr Ivers Riley, chief executive of the futures exchange, played down risk management fears and said the instruments could decrease volatility because of their role in hedging. He also dismissed concerns that followed the launch of similar products in Sydney, saying the row there was essentially one over the regulatory scheme and who could launch the products. 'Risk management systems here are light years away from 1987; even so, there will be special provisions such as limiting the size of the position and position reporting.' There will also be margin requirements, although these have not yet been set. Trading in the two new futures is expected to start before the year end. The stock exchange is not convinced. 'If you trade an option the liability is limited by the option price; the futures liability would be the value of the futures contract, which would be unlimited,' an official said.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Labour committee proposes sweeping electoral reforms SWEEPING CHANGES to the way parliament is elected are proposed in a report by the Labour party's working party on electoral systems. The committee, chaired by Lord Plant of Highfield, recommends abolishing the first-past-the-post system now used for elections to the House of Commons, in favour of an untried system known as the supplementary vote. Labour's national executive committee meets today to discuss the report. The discussion will begin a consultation period on the Plant report before further NEC discussion in advance of a decision at the autumn party conference. However, it looks likely to open up a new split in the party, already deeply divided over internal reforms such as the loosening of links with the trades unions. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, will be hoping to avoid an open split by backing the idea of a national referendum on electoral reform at today's meeting. Mr Smith is cautious about electoral reform although he is said to have accepted the case for change. But a group of MPs opposed to electoral reform yesterday launched a campaign to retain the first-past-the-post system for elections to the commons. Mr Derek Fatchett, chairman of the group, warned that for a newly elected Labour government to spend its first year or two on electoral reform would be 'Labour's equivalent of a new Maastricht bill', in terms of its divisiveness and irrelevance. The Plant report says that the present system fails to reflect the changing nature of British society. It examines three options for changing the UK's electoral system so that the number of MPs from each party more closely reflects party support, without losing the direct link between MPs and constituencies. All three options would have left the Conservatives short of an overall majority at the last election and almost certainly have resulted in a minority Labour government. By a narrow majority, the Plant committee recommends that Labour should adopt the supplementary vote system devised by Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, MP for Workington. This would allow voters to express a second preference which would be taken into account if no candidate won more than 50 per cent of the first preference votes. Other recommendations in the report include: Proportional representation for elections to the European parliament and to the elected second chamber which Labour proposes to replace the House of Lords. Introducing four-year fixed-term parliaments. State funding for political parties, and restrictions on national spending by parties in general elections. Measures to improve the electoral process, by registering more voters, making postal voting easier, moving elections to the weekend and allowing votes to be cast up to eight days in advance.

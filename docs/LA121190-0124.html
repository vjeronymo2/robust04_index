			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> STUDENTS DUCK SHOTS FIRED NEAR SCHOOL  </P> <P> Six students ran for cover as several shots were fired at them Monday near  Louis Lake High School.  </P> <P> No one was injured and no arrests were made.  </P> <P> School officials said they believed the incident was gang related and that the  students are gang members. The shooting occurred about 8:25 a.m. at Lake School  Park, which adjoins the high school.  </P> <P> Principal Tom Robins said that the six students had gone without permission to  a convenience store in a nearby shopping center. Assistant Principal Larry  O'Donnell had followed them and ordered them to return.  </P> <P> As they were walking back to school, Robins said, his students had a "chance  meeting with three youngsters from another gang. The youngsters shouted  something at my students and they returned the insults," Robins said.  </P> <P> The attackers got into a car and headed west on Orangewood Avenue, Robins said.  Then the car stopped, one of its occupants got out, crouched and fired at the  six students, who were about 40 yards away.  </P> <P> "They were running and diving for cover," Robins said. "We're shocked but  relieved that no one was hurt."  </P> <P> O'Donnell, who was in his car heading back to campus, said he heard the  gunshots and saw the students "run in all directions."  </P> <P> "After the gunman used up all the bullets, the students got up and shrugged as  if to say, 'Hey, you missed us,' " O'Donnell said. "That's typical gang  mentality."  </P> <P> The gunman jumped into the car, which sped away west on Orangewood. O'Donnell  said that he tried to chase the car to get its license number, but lost sight  of it.  </P> <P> "We were darned lucky that no one was hit," Robins said. "This is a quiet  campus and we can do without gangs and shootings." DAVAN MAHARAJ  </P></p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank: Why World Bank is shifting policy - Private sector needs more aid to finance infrastructure The decision by the World Bank to increase sharply the financial guarantees it makes to commercial lenders recognises that private-sector investors need more help if they are to finance a growing proportion of the world's infrastructure. Governments struggling to contain public spending are unable to meet all the demands from their populations for better transport, power, water and sewerage systems. Private-sector lenders and investors, on the other hand, are reluctant to put money into emerging countries with little history of private-sector investment and where strong political risks may remain. Commercial banks lending to these countries demand higher interest rates and are reluctant to grant long-term loans. Partial financial guarantees from the the World Bank would provide comfort to other lenders and allow schemes to proceed which otherwise might not have taken place, says Dr Ashoka Mody, principal financial economist at the bank's project finance group. The Bank, which previously has lent mainly to state bodies would still be required under its articles to seek counter-guarantees from the government of the country in which the project was located. In return, it would guarantee commercial lenders against the failure of state agencies to meet contractual obligations. These might include: Maintaining agreed tariff formulas and regulatory frameworks; Making available sufficient fuel, in the case of a power station; Meeting payment targets where these have been agreed with state and municipal authorities Providing compensation for delays caused by government actions or political events. The Bank, however, would not cover commercial risks such as construction delays, inadequate costing or the failure of customers to purchase services in expected numbers. 'We want to use guarantees as a catalyst. By covering some of the risks that the commercial market is not able to bear or evaluate adequately, we hope to attract new sources of finance, reduce funding costs overall and extend the maturity of commercial loans,' said Dr Mody. The decision to increase the availability of financial guarantees to the private sector represents a marked shift in the bank's policy. The Bank has total outstanding loans of Dollars 104bn (Pounds 69.3bn), mostly to governments and government agencies, compared with financial guarantees to commercial lenders covering just Dollars 1bn of loans. The Bank's size, credit rating, special relationships with governments and experience in negotiating counter-guarantees means it is better suited to support large-scale projects than the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's commercial lending arm, and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency which deals in areas considered politically risky. The IFC and MIGA, which traditionally have provided smaller loans, guarantees and credit insurance to the private sector will continue these operations but the Bank is expected to take the lead role on big privately-financed projects. Dr Mody, speaking in London at a Financial Times conference on infrastructure investments, said financial guarantees had already helped a small number of infrastructure projects raise private capital more cheaply. A partial credit guarantee covering 22 per cent of the present value of a Dollars 120m loan from commercial banks and insurance companies had enabled Chinese authorities to extend the maturity of the loan from 5 to 15 years for the Dollars 1.08bn Yangzhou thermal power project. Similar World Bank support for a Dollars 100m bond issue for the Leyte-Luzon geothermal project in the Philippines had extended the payment period from 10 to 15 years. The bank's support was equivalent to 36 per cent of the credit risk exposure at present values. The fees for such deals typically are expected to be 0.25 per cent during the life of the guarantee. This however would rise to between 0.4 and 1 per cent during the danger period when the guarantee might be triggered. In the case of the China and Philippines power projects, the promoters were the state while the World Bank guarantees covered credit rather than contractual risk. In future, deals will be done directly with private lenders and promoters and cover both contractual and credit risk of state bodies defaulting on payments. Developing countries are estimated to spend about Dollars 200bn on infrastructure investment, of which about 90 per cent comes from government sources. The proportion paid for by private investors is forecast to rise sharply over the next few years and the World Bank expects to play an increasing role in assisting this market.</p>

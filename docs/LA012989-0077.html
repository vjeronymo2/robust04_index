			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISLAND REMEMBRANCES  </P> <P> The Jerry Payne who wrote that beautiful article in the Travel Section should  at least do a travel book. I read all of Henry David Thoreau's books, even his  fiction, and I may be personally prejudiced, but Payne has far more talent and  a far greater flair for human interest. Such talent should be used.  </P> <P> LINDSLEY PARSONS  </P> <P> Film Finances  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

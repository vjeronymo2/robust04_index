			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oles Danylyuk: "Zhirinovskiy's Party Offers </F> Ukraine One More Chance"]    [Text] The victory of the Liberal Democratic Party,  led by admitted nationalist Zhirinovskiy, in the parliamentary  election in Russia should have cooled the heads of those who  rely not on force but on the 'good will' of our northern  neighbor.    All major political forces in Ukraine, even Moscow-oriented  ones, expressed their concern over Zhirinovskiy's victory. But  this does not mean that no one in this country any longer looks  to our Russian brethren. Probably both Kuchma and Grynyov are  still counting on the Russian president, who was given enormous  powers by the constitution which was approved on 12 December. It  is even more probable, however, that Yeltsin will deliberately  change his course in line with the results of the election:  already, dissatisfaction with the Russia Choice presidential  bloc has been heard from members of his inner circle. It is yet  unclear how this change will affect the course toward the  Interregional Reform Bloc set by the Kuchma-Grynyov duo, but it  can be predicted with considerable certainty that the election  in Russia took away Yeltsin's trump card: Russia's reformist  image.    The extreme right-wing forces in Ukraine, on the contrary,  welcomed the news of Zhirinovskiy's victory. They projected the  Liberal Democrats' victory onto the situation in Ukraine and  decided that they would have a very good chance of winning the  parliamentary election here. True, they do not take into account  that in one-seat districts the Liberal Democrats did not win a  large number of seats. This brings one to the conclusion that in  Russia, it was not the Liberal Democrats but Zhirinovskiy's gift  as a public speaker that won the day. In Ukraine, the extreme  right has not yet produced demagogues of Zhirinovskiy's caliber.  Moreover, the core part of Vladimir Volfovich's program, the  Russian national idea, is accepted by an absolute majority of  Russians, whereas the basic Ukrainian national idea--Ukraine for  Ukrainians from the San to the Don--does not have a mass  following here.    Ukraine as a country will only gain from Zhirinovskiy's  victory. Or, more precisely, it would win if it became more  actively involved in Russia's domestic policy. First of all,  Russia's autonomous entities are unhappy with both the new  parliament, headed by Zhirinovskiy the unitarianist, and the new  constitution, which lacks a clause on federalism. Their rights  have been left up in the air, and it is easy to predict that the  central government will try to curb them. It is doubtful that  the republics will easily give back their powers to Moscow. On  12 December, three republics refused to take part in the  election. The friction between regions and the center are  growing, and Vladimir Volfovich could become bogged down in  endless actions to restore order within Russia itself. Hard work  in this field will force him to limit his demands for Ukrainian  territory to oral statements.    Second, despite Zhirinovskiy's victory, no one party won a  majority in both chambers of parliament. A stable bloc of  parties, which would have ensured a solid majority, would be  very difficult to construct, given the ambitions of the Liberal  Democrats' leader. A patchwork parliament would lose its way in  squabbles and rivalries and would not be able to lead a  well-functioning state. Lack of stable power in Russia would  once again force it to spend more time on domestic troubles than  on external expansion.    Third, the artificial dependence on Russia of the Ukrainian  economy (in energy, components, etc.) would have weakened  regardless of the results of Russia's election. It had been  known long before that since the start of the new year Russia  would be selling us energy at world prices, so that it would  make no difference for Ukraine where to buy it. And, the rise of  prices for Russian output has already effectively made it more  profitable to buy components from major foreign companies, where  they are not much more expensive but of much better quality.  This approach would only benefit Ukrainian producers who, in  order to save a penny, are now willing to sacrifice the quality  of output.    Other arguments can be used to prove that there is nothing  harmful for Ukraine in Zhirinovskiy's victory in the Russian  election--if we have confidence in ourselves, of course. It now  depends on ourselves what the victory of the Liberal Democrats  will mean to us: victory or defeat.</p>

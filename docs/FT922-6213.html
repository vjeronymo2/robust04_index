			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Survey of Korea (8): The advantages of North-South links - How to restore industrial competitiveness IF South Korea's industrialists had their way, the hesitant diplomatic dalliance between North and South would give way to an early economic bearhug. The most optimistic of the southern visionaries see close economic links with the North as the basis for a resurgence of international competitiveness. Such co-operation, say its proponents, would give South Korea the best of two seemingly contradictory economic worlds. First, it could restore Korea's declining competitiveness in traditional export items such as footwear and clothes by shifting production to the North, instead of to low wage countries in Southeast Asia. The application of even modest South Korean technology to the North's abundant supply of cheap and disciplined labour would lead to big productivity gains, say many Seoul economists. They believe that once such low-end but still lucrative export markets were secured, South Korean industry would be more confident about undertaking risky investments in high-technology areas. A by-product of the process would be the economic upliftment of 20m North Koreans, who would constitute a virtually captive consumer market for the south's industry. In addition, southern access to the North's mineral and other natural resources would lessen its dependence on imports, while defence spending, which constitutes a quarter of government expenditure, could be reduced substantially. Such a rosy scenario, however, assumes an orderly development of links with the the North, rather than any sudden lurch towards unification and the attendant risks of massive economic dislocation. And it may underestimate the difficulty of working within the North's troubled economy. Figures from the Economic Planning Board (EPB) in Seoul suggest that North Korea's gross national product shrank by 3.7 per cent in 1990, when it was hit by raw material and oil shortages caused by a change from barter to hard currency trade with the former Soviet Union. Mr Byung-Bae Kim, director of the EPB unit monitoring the North's economy, guesses that growth last year was 'at best at a standstill'. The government-funded Korea Development Institute estimates that the North's GNP was Dollars 27.3bn in 1990, about a tenth of the South's, while GNP per head was Dollars 1,273, a fifth of the Dollars 5,569 official figure for South Korea. Trade between the two economies has been minimal, and has generally been carried out through third countries such as China, Japan and Singapore. EPB figures for intra-Korean trade last year indicate that the South received Dollars 166m worth of goods - mostly non-ferrous minerals, gold, silver and coal - while sending Dollars 26m worth of mainly chemicals, textiles and home appliances to the North. Mr Kim says the growth of direct trade will depend on the pace of North-South talks this year, though a tentative agreement has been reached to set up a clearing account to facilitate greater exchanges. However, agreements on the avoidance of double taxation, commercial arbitration and the protection of investments will be required before Seoul approves the first joint ventures, he says. The need for additional negotiations has not put off southern industrialists, especially those who believe they can create on their own doorstep a Korean version of southern China's fast-growing Guangdong province. Mr Kim Woo-Chung, founder and chief executive of Daewoo Group, made a much-publicised trip to the North last January, during which he tentatively agreed to set up joint ventures in a number of light industries at the special economic zone which North Korea has proposed building at the port of Nampo. He also discussed mining projects and a scheme in which 10,000 North Korean workers would be used on a Daewoo contract to build a highway in Pakistan. The other big conglomerates, including Hyundai, whose founder was born in the North, are said to be equally keen despite a lack of hard information about the state of North Korean industry. Daewoo's Mr Kim Woo-Chung reported that productivity at the factories he visited seemed to be about half that of equivalent plants in the South, though he predicted that North Koreans would have little difficulty in adapting to more modern technology. Rivalry among the Korean conglomerates (and possibly foreign companies) to secure North Korean partners is likely to be heightened by the fact that most industrial sectors have only a few main companies, thus encouraging early link-ups. The Seoul government says it will gauge the success of small-scale joint ventures before approving any big industrial projects or partnerships with the North. And it will need to know much more about the soundness of individual North Korean companies, says Mr Kim at the EPB. But Pyongyang has made it clear that it has an ambitious development agenda of its own. Mr Kim Dal-hyon, the North Korean deputy prime minister responsible for the economy, said recently that Pyongyang would welcome broader foreign investment. He said the invitation included investment from the US although that would have to await a resolution of the nuclear issue and the lifting of a US ban on most commercial contacts with the North. Such statements, however, indicate just how far the North Korean government is prepared to go to attract foreign investment, which it believes can be confined to the SEZs or other specific areas, such as proposed tourist developments in mountainous areas revered by both North and South Koreans. South Korean companies accept that that will be the pattern for the first projects. But many economists in Seoul doubt whether Pyongyang can keep the bulk of its population isolated from foreign influences for long, especially as industrial logic will dictate the location of any large-scale projects. In the longer term, the focus for South Korean and foreign investment in North Korea could switch to the Tumen River basin along the border with China and Russia. A plan put forward by the United Nations Development Programme calls for the phased construction of a cross-border free trade zone near the mouth of the river. The zone would then serve as the base for developing the vast natural resources of the sparsely-populated hinterland of the region. Regular talks, which include South Korean and Mongolian representatives, are being held on ways of developing such a zone, which the UNDP estimates could cost Dollars 30bn over 15-20 years. That kind of talk clearly excites South Korean companies. It also pleases their government, which views any development that promises the orderly opening up of the North as positive. 'Recent events in Germany show us that unification can take any form and can proceed at any speed,' says Mr Kim at the EPB. 'There will always be a painful transition, but the costs can be much lower if the process is orderly.'</p>

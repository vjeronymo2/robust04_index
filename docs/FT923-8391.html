			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Mexican toll road deal A MEXICAN consortium headed by Grupo ICA has won a contract to build a 340km toll road from Mexico City to Guadalajara, at a cost of Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 620m), the biggest such contract ever awarded in Mexico, Damian Fraser reports from Mexico City. The consortium, made up of the Mexican companies Grupo ICA, Tribasa, Grupo de Desarrollo Mexicano and the brokerage Interacciones, intends to finance half the cost by international and domestic highway bonds, with returns guaranteed by future motorway tolls. These would be the first international bonds to finance an as-yet-unfinished motorway. The building company PACSA, owned by Tribasa, re-financed a completed motorway with Dollars 207.5m of international bonds in June. Concessions have been awarded for 3,500km of toll roads, with plans to raise this to 5,700km. The ICA group has the concession on the Guadalajara-Mexico City motorway for 18 years.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Government spokesman Dieter  Vogel said Honecker's death did "not come as a surprise." In an  interview with Deutschlandfunk, Vogel added: "We all knew that  he had been ill with cancer for a long time, and one had to  expect this end." Vogel could not officially confirm Honecker's  alleged wish that his ashes be buried in Germany. "But if such  a wish exists, it can probably be fulfilled, because there is no  legal means of refusing this."</p>

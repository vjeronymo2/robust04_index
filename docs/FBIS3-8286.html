The main aim of their trip was signing an agreement with  the Exim Bank of Japan about the loan to the value of  approximately $42 million.    The first installment of this loan will be transferred to  Slovakia as early as 9 March. It will be used for the support  of small-scale and medium businesses. The first repayment of  the loan has been set for 15 February 1998.    Representatives of the National Bank of Slovakia also held  talks with the Japanese bank about the possibility of support in  financing large investment projects. They include, above all,  development of railway and river transport, development of the  Bratislava airport, and transportation of gas and oil. [passage  omitted]</p>

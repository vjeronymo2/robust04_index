Ltd., 8-3 Kiba 2-chome, Koto-ku, Tokyo 135,  Japan]    [Text]  <H5>  Preface </H5>   In urban districts, the existing municipal water supply and  effluent facilities are almost saturated as the result of the  concentrated population and raised level of living. In order to  solve such a problem, miscellaneous water utilization systems to  treat waste water for reuse have been introduced in newly  constructed large-size buildings in large cities such as Tokyo.  Among such various systems, an actual example of reusing  building waste water with tubular UF membrane is shown and  result of study on applications of a dynamic membrane filtration  method using hollow fiber MF membrane is discussed below.  <H5>  Building Waste Water Reuse System Using Membrane </H5> <H5>  Features </H5>   The waste water recycle/reuse system using membrane is  relatively free from influences coming from load fluctuation and  as such can produce treated water of a stable quality because it  is a physical treatment process using membrane as the main  treatment medium. This system can be automatically operated, if  one so desires, and therefore controlled easily. In addition,  the equipment can be made compact in size.    Under the present conditions, the waste water reuse methods  using membrane are broadly classified into the RO method and UF  method. When these two methods are compared, the UF method is  more advantageous with respect to the quality of the treated  water, while the UF method is better with respect to the  economics such as investment cost and operating expense. Use of  the recycled building waste water is in almost all cases limited  to flushing of toilet stools. Such a high level of water quality  as that of drinking water is not required. thus, the UF method  is though to be more appropriate.  <H5>  Example of Implementation </H5>   An example of implementation of the building waste water  recycle/reuse system using UF membrane in a K building is shown  below. The waste water is from the kitchens and miscellaneous  waste water, mixed with part of sewerage. Figure 1 [not  reproduced] shows a flow of the system.    In this system, waste water is contact-aerated, then  cross-flow filtrated with tubular type PAN membrane of 13,000 in  molecular weight cut-off, and finally disinfected with chlorine  to recycle water. Recovery ratio of the recycled water is about  70 percent. The membrane separation unit is periodically cleaned  with a sponge ball and chemicals to maintain the flux.    The role of the UF membrane here is to remove the turbidity  substance and unresolved high molecular components in the raw  water. An example of treatment with this system is shown in  Table 1.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

With the  membrane method, no fungi leak to the treated water. This is a  very safe process in this respect.  <H5>  Study on Application of Dynamic Membrane Filtration Method </H5>   In order to reduce the water recycling cost, feasibility to  recycle and reuse waste water from buildings by the dynamic  filtration method using the MF membrane which is cheaper than  the UF membrane was studied particularly from the standpoint of  quality of the treated water.  <H5>  Tests </H5>   The above-described waste water from the K Building after  contact aeration was filtrated with MF membrane and compared  with water treated with the existing UF membrane facility. MF  membrane of polyethylene hollow fiber of 0.2 m in pore  diameter was used. The same cross-flow filtration method as with  the UF membrane was adopted. Back wash method with permeated  water was applied for the MF membrane because of the different  membrane forms. Filtration conditions were so set that the  energies used for cross-flow are equivalent. Respective  filtration conditions are shown in Table 2.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2.

The quality of treated water  was on the same level for both membranes.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 3.

No component of molecular weight  higher than several thousands was observed in water treated  either with the MF or UF membrane. It seems that the  characteristics of molecular weight cut-off depend on the  dynamic membrane formed on the membrane surface more than on the  membrane itself.    Then, the COD[.sub]Mn[/] of water treated with the  membrane was measured before back wash, and 1, 3, 10, and 20  minutes after it to examine changes in the quality of water  against time. The results are shown in Table 4. Changes in the  flux during this process are shown in Figure 3 [not reproduced].  The flux was changed from 0.8 to 1.0  m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]-day from before the back wash.  Dynamic membrane form is supposed to have changed but difference  was not observed in the membrane-treated water. This suggests  dynamic membrane of self-rejection type was formed.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 4.

The following reasons have been  cited so far:    a. MF membrane is inferior with respect to the quality of  treated water.    b. MF membrane causes clogging of SS in the pore.    Studies have been carried out on application of a building  waste water reuse system using MF membrane. At least regarding  the water quality, the same treatment result was obtained with  the MF membrane as with the UF membrane.    As a subject to be taken up in the future in order to put  the  MF membrane into practical use for the waste water reuse  systems, maintenance of high flux for a long time and economic  efficiency should be furthermore studied.  <H5>  Postface </H5>   Among waste water reuse facilities, those of individual  circulation type account for more than 80 percent. Their use was  limited to washing toilet stools before. However, to recycle and  reuse water more efficiently, an area circulation system is  desirable to recycle and supply water covering an entire city or  as a center for each district. With the increase of demand for  water, wider district circulation systems will be employed. For  the reclaimed water applications, their use will be increased  not only to flushing toilet stools but also to supply water for  sprinkling, hydrophile and other uses. It is an important  subject of waste water reuse to develop treatment techniques  suitable to objects, paying attention to the safety and economic  efficiency.</p>

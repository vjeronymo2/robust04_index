			<p>920411 FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: City poised for more bids and deals activity THE REMOVAL of political uncertainty for the next few years gave many companies yesterday cause for relief and the opportunity to say that corporate planning would be that much easier. However, this is not to say that corporate financiers expect a sudden opening of the bids and deals floodgates, as one explained, partly because 'no one expected the Tories to win'. But they do believe that political certainty will make their clients more willing to contemplate making acquisitions. Among potential predators, there is some relief that the threat of Labour-imposed takeover restrictions has been lifted. Mr Ian Duncan, finance director of Tomkins, the industrial conglomerate, said the group had been looking to make a UK acquisition for some time, but it had become 'a bit passive' prior to the election. Had Labour won, it might have seen better prospects for growth overseas. Both Tomkins and Williams Holdings, another conglomerate with the financial strength to acquire, have complained about the difficulty of finding 'sensibly priced' targets in the UK. Ironically, a Labour victory or a hung parliament might have helped on that issue by cutting share prices. But the main response is expected to be towards more action. Mr Gavin Simmonds, a corporate finance director at Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, said the election result, 'will have a profound effect on the mergers and acquisitions market', bringing a return of the longer-term players. Whatever happens to the price of potential targets, a rising stock market would give acquisitive companies more firepower to make bids with their own shares. Similarly, if the market remains strong it could trigger rights issues. Mr Brian McGowan, chief executive of Williams, commented: 'Companies will see the opportunities to repair balance sheets and raise money for other activities.' Other companies pointed out that some negative factors remain. Mr Roger Wood, finance director at Wimpey, the housebuilder, said: 'There is still the uncertainty of unemployment and of housing affordability, which both hold down house prices.' He did, however, believe that the result would bring forward a recovery in house prices. At English China Clays, Mr Andrew Teare, chief executive, said the sale of the group's housing landbank would be facilitated by the result. Companies rather more dependent on the UK economy, for instance in the construction industry, may not find the market immediately receptive to rights issues, even after the election-inspired gains. Mr Wood, while stressing that Wimpey had no plans for a cash call, said: 'Once the initial euphoria dies away, too little will remain for construction companies to raise large amounts of cash. We need some demonstrable signs that we are coming out of recession.' A revival of the new-issue market, later in the year, is forecast by another banker. He suggests that management buy-outs completed before the recession could now be looking to float. MFI, the kitchen and bedroom retailer, is one likely candidate.</p>

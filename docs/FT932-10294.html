			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Vulnerable Lamont dogged by Tory calls for his departure MR NORMAN Lamont will this week try to shrug off mounting criticism of his economic stewardship - but he faces an insurmountable task in squashing speculation of his removal in a summer reshuffle. Ministers yesterday acknowledged that the chancellor had become a lightning conductor for Tory MPs' alarm over the whole government's performance and argued that personal criticism of him was unfair. But Downing Street and cabinet ministers have done little to counter suggestions that Mr John Major will reshuffle his cabinet around the summer recess at the end of July. With Mr Lamont's reputation already damaged following Britain's traumatic exit from the European exchange rate mechanism, there is now a widespread belief at Westminster that he is too great a liability to be saved. He may, however, be offered the dignity of another senior cabinet post. No cabinet minister has speculated publicly on how long Mr Lamont will remain at the Treasury, but the number of senior Tories who are privately urging his removal is growing. In a speech to the Scottish Tory party conference on Wednesday Mr Lamont will attempt to rebuild confidence that the government's economic policies will lead to sustainable economic growth. Yet the audience's reaction may show the depth of Mr Lamont's unpopularity among Tory activists - even though criticism after Thursday's election results is strongest in the traditional Conservative heartlands of southern England. Among grassroots Tories there is contempt at Mr Lamont's ability to dismiss the volte face over the ERM without appreciating the recession's impact on individual lives. There is a perception too that Mr Major tried for too long last year to save Mr David Mellor as national heritage secretary and that the same mistake should not be repeated. Mr Lamont's 'je ne regrette rien' remark during the Newbury by-election was seen as insensitive, smacking of arrogance where contrition would have fitted better. In the short term Mr Lamont is probably safe. He himself argues that the prime minister cannot be bounced into decisions by press hounding. In comments which, perhaps deliberately fell short of fulsome backing, Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary and a possible successor as chancellor, said yesterday: 'It is the unfairness of the treatment of Norman that has caused his colleagues to rally to him in recent months.' Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, and tipped as another possibility for the chancellorship, said on BBC television that the chancellor had been the victim of a 'virulent press campaign'. To an extent they are right that the treatment of Mr Lamont is too personalised. To some Tory MPs he is a scapegoat - to blame Mr Lamont is easier than voicing fears that the problems facing the government under Mr Major go far wider. But the vicissitudes of politics mean scapegoats are inevitable when a party is in trouble. Mr Lamont, who was appointed chancellor when Mrs Margaret Thatcher was toppled as prime minister, would not be the first to complain at the injustices of politics.</p>

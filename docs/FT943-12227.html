			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: UK sales lift American Brands A sharp rise in cigarette sales in the UK supported earnings at American Brands, the US consumer products group, in the second quarter of the year. The rise was largely due to timing factors, as the company's Gallagher subsidiary maintained its claimed market share in the UK at 40 per cent. Meanwhile, earnings from US cigarette sales, though continuing a partial recovery from the effects of the price war begun last summer, were 23 per cent lower than a year ago. The company recently reached agreement to sell its American Tobacco subsidiary to BAT Industries for Dollars 1bn. The increase in volumes in the UK of 44 per cent was due to 'distortions caused by a change last year in the timing of the UK government's budget,' said Mr William Alley, chairman and chief executive. Operating income from non-US tobacco sales more than doubled, to Dollars 94m, on sales up 49 per cent to Dollars 1.2bn. American Tobacco, meanwhile, saw operating income slide to Dollars 70m, on sales of Dollars 406m (Dollars 419m a year ago.) Its volume gains of 15 per cent in the quarter were slightly ahead of the industry average, resulting in an increase in market share, the company said. The volume growth was led by low-price brands, which rose 20 per cent, while premium brands rose only 8 per cent. With the benefit of a lower tax rate, down to 31.3 per cent from 36 per cent a year ago, American Brands reported overall net income of Dollars 164m, or 81 cents a share, up from Dollars 151m, or 75 cents, a year ago. Half-year net income fell to Dollars 313m from Dollars 398m (before accounting changes) in the first six months of 1993.</p>

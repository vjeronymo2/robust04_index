			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Mar 16, BNS -- The Russian Community in  Estonia proposed that the parliament pass some regulations to  make leaving Estonia easier for those non-Estonians who have  decided to resettle in the other former Soviet republics.    In a letter to parliament Speaker Ulo Nugis, the Council of  the Russian Community suggests that persons registered with the  Citizenship and Migration Department as resettlers be allowed to  privatize their apartments without delay and either sell them  freely or mortgage them to raise funds.    The council also proposes that one member of a repatriating  family be allowed to cross the border freely and free of charge  either during a five-year period or until the family completes  building housing and resettling.    The problems involved in privatizing and selling their  apartments and the lack of documents necessary for the  unavoidable trips abroad in connection with repatriation are at  present the major stumbling blocks for the non-Estonians who  want to leave Estonia.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Ominous Elections"] </F>   [Text] The Austrians took part en masse in the referendum  on membership of the European Union [EU] and agreed to the entry  treaty by an unexpectedly high percentage of around 66 percent.  This Austrian "yes" increases the chance that this year not just  the Finns, but also the more sceptical Swedes and Norwegians  will join the EU.    The Austrians rightly listened to the arguments of the  government, employers and trade unions, namely that membership  is good for the economy and national security. Rejecting the  treaty would have isolated Austria and therefore made it  vulnerable.    The Austrian "yes" seems to be in opposition to the  half-hearted and dull election campaign for the European  Parliament in those countries which are already members of the  EU. But this contradiction is above all one of appearance. The  EU certainly has its faults, but it is undeniably an area of  peace, stability and welfare. This and the single market are  very attractive to European countries outside the EU.    In the member states themselves these acquisitions are taken  for granted. In essence the big parties do not differ in their  opinions regarding the usefulness of European cooperation. And  if there are serious differences in opinion, then they cut  through the parties, like in the British Conservatives and the  French Gaullists. Moreover no one is enthusiastic about that  distant parliament in Strasbourg.    The result has been that in many EU countries national  themes  came to the forefront and the European elections were  transformed into national polls.    On Sunday [12 June] this led above all to disappointment for  the German Social Democrats. Their expectations of winning the  parliamentary elections this autumn received a serious setback.  The CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union]  did surprisingly well and won.    According to the forecasts, the Spanish socialists suffered  their first defeat since 1982. Prime Minister Gonzalez was  presented with the bill for the recent corruption scandals in  government and the public authorities. And after Sunday the  French Socialists seem to have very little chance of winning  next year's presidential elections.    However, all this has little to do with the legitimacy of  the  European Parliament, which has certainly not increased with  these elections. Europe will have to be a far more central  issue in future European elections.    This requires that the EU countries allow the formation of  European parties and make the European parliament truly  representative of the people. If they are not prepared to do  so, then there is a danger that the European Parliament could  wither definitively to an institution with as little power as it  has respect.</p>

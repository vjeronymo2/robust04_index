			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: CSFB Budapest completes Ft500m issue CREDIT Suisse First Boston Budapest, the Hungarian subsidiary of the US investment bank, this week completed a bond issue which highlights the increasing potential of local capital markets for financing western-led investment. CSFB Budapest placed Ft500m (Dollars 6.5m) of bonds on its own account with Hungarian financial institutions in the second issue of private corporate debt since the disintegration of communism. With a four-year maturity and a step-down coupon averaging 27 per cent, CSFB's issue was similar in structure to the one it lead-managed on behalf of McDonald's Hungarian subsidiary. The two issues have launched the market, said Mr Janos Bartha, chief executive of CSFB Budapest. He said CSFB, confident of the ability to place and the existence of issuers, was working on further bond issues for clients. The CSFB Budapest move closely followed the announcement by Samsung Electronics Hungary, a subsidiary of the South Korean conglomerate, of plans for a share flotation on to Budapest's fledgling stock exchange. Analysts say the cases show the attractions to western companies based in Hungary of issuing securities over bank borrowing at interest rates of over 30 per cent. Meanwhile, preliminary selection of bids for Malev, the Hungarian national airline which CSFB is mandated to privatise, is gearing up this week.</p>

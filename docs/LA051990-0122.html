			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GWALTNEY FRUSTRATES HIMSELF, LOS ALAMITOS WITH NO-HITTER  </P> <P> At times, Jim Gwaltney struggled with his control. At other times, he was  visibly frustrated with the umpiring.  </P> <P> In fact, throughout most of Friday's 5-A playoff game, Gwaltney labored and  fussed, nibbled at the corners and scratched for outs. But in the end, it was  well worth the effort.  </P> <P> Gwaltney got the Ocean View High School baseball team off to a good start in  the playoffs. He ended up with a no-hitter and the Seahawks defeated Los  Alamitos, 4-0, in a first-round game at Ocean View.  </P> <P> "I really didn't have my best stuff when I went out there," said Gwaltney, a  senior left-hander. "My control wasn't good and I didn't think I was getting  many calls. I finally had to get mad at myself."  </P> <P> Gwaltney walked three through the first three innings, including two in the  second. In the fifth, he stalked off the mound after what he thought was a bad  call on a pitch.  </P> <P> After pacing behind the mound for 30 seconds, Gwaltney went back to work. He  retired eight of the last nine batters.  </P> <P> "Jim kind of bowed his neck there in the fifth," Ocean View Coach Steve Barrett  said. "At that point, I knew Los Alamitos wasn't going to hit him."  </P> <P> The Griffins had only one baserunner over the final three innings. Todd  Gragnano walked with one out in the sixth, but Gwaltney got Tony Napolitano to  hit into a double play to end the inning.  </P> <P> The closest Los Alamitos came to a hit was in the seventh, when Tyler Cashman  hit a hard ground ball wide of first base. But first baseman Eric Schaff made a  diving stop and threw to Gwaltney, who was covering, to end the game.  </P> <P> "Eric really saved me," said Gwaltney, who struck out five. "When the ball was  hit, I thought, 'There goes the no-hitter.' But he made a great play and I got  over to first as fast as I could. I wasn't going to let anything spoil it  then."  </P> <P> Gwaltney (8-3), who had a 1.59 earned-run average entering the game, allowed  only two balls to be hit out of the infield. The Griffins had 20 ground-ball  outs.  </P> <P> "That's our game when Jim's pitching," Barrett said. "He just rolls the ball to  our infielders and let's them do the work."  </P> <P> The Seahawks (20-7) didn't have a lot of success at the plate themselves. They  got only four hits off Gragnano (4-5), who also walked eight.  </P> <P> Third baseman Curtis Bruce led the way with two hits. He singled in the first  run in the third inning. In the fifth, he doubled and later scored on a wild  pitch to give the Seahawks a 2-0 lead.  </P> <P> Richard Jones broke the game open in the sixth with a two-run double.  </P> <P> The defeat ended Mike Gibson's coaching career at Los Alamitos. Gibson resigned  Wednesday for health reasons.  </P> <P> "It would have been nice to get at least one more win before retiring . . . or  at least a hit," Gibson said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: STARR-CROSSED  </P> <P> The long-shelved "Brenda Starr," based on the plucky reporter/comic book  character, briefly came off the shelf Friday -- for a "world premiere" showing  in Jacksonville, Fla.  </P> <P> The screening marked the Florida Film Festival's salute to filmmaker Robert  Ellis Miller ("The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter," "Reuben, Reuben"), who requested  that "Brenda Starr" be screened.  </P> <P> "I wanted to finally get her out of jail," Miller tells us. "It's always  misunderstood when a picture doesn't come out. 'Brenda' deserves her day."  </P> <P> Starring Brooke Shields as Starr and a pre-James Bond Timothy Dalton as her  mysterious rescuer, Basil St. John, the $16-million "Brenda Starr" was filmed  in late 1986, with an early 1988 release planned. Then it got ensnared in legal  entanglements involving video rights. Things were further complicated when New  World, which had distribution rights, was sold and phased out its domestic  division.  </P> <P> Now, reports Miller, the British consortium that financed the film is acquiring  it from New World "and there are currently negotiations for a major release --  at last."

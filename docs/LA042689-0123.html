			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFTERMATH OF A SCANDAL;  </P> <P> JAPANESE COMPANY'S STORY REFLECTS TIES BETWEEN BUSINESS, POLITICAL PRACTICES  </P> <P> By American standards, Hiromasa Ezoe would have been considered a success  story. But by Japanese standards, and his own, his successes weren't enough.  </P> <P> Ezoe, born in a lower-class background in class-conscious Japan, founded  Recruit Co. with an initial investment of $1,400 in 1960, while still in his  20s. Starting out by simply publishing a single news sheet that advertised jobs  for students, the company grew enormously under his direction until more than  25 years later it had become a giant information, computer and real estate  conglomerate with annual sales of close to $4 billion.  </P> <P> But in Japan, guiding a fast-growing young business isn't sufficient to win  influence and acceptance in that nation's tight inner circle of high-ranking  government and business decision-makers. Ezoe has been charged with secretly  lavishing such leaders with gifts and low-priced stock, winning himself  appointments to several government advisory boards.  </P> <P> Disclosures of these influence-buying arrangements have resulted in the biggest  political scandal to hit Japan since former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka was  convicted in 1983 on charges of taking bribes from Lockheed Corp. in the early  1970s. Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's announcement this week that he would  resign made him the latest in a series of top officials -- including three  Cabinet members -- to step down in disgrace. Ezoe earlier had resigned as  Recruit chairman, facing multiple charges of bribery. A dozen others have been  arrested and charged, including a prominent Japanese businessman and two former  vice ministers.  </P> <P> The Recruit scandal is not just a rags-to-riches story of an ambitious Japanese  entrepreneur whose lust for influence brought down an entire administration. It  is a dramatic illustration of the tight relations between government and  business in Japan, and how politicians depend on businesses to provide money  and assets to fuel that nation's expensive political system.  </P> <P> The scandal is remarkable not so much because influence buying was attempted.  Indeed, such practices are widespread and tolerated. But, rather, it is because  the alleged bribes were done on such a large scale, with so many high-ranking  officials, and were exposed so widely by a Japanese print and broadcast media  that has let previous instances go by largely unreported.  </P> <P> "The funny thing is that this caused such a fuss . . . because it is standard  operating procedure," said Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., senior associate at the  Carnegie Endowment in Washington and former counselor for Japan affairs at the  Commerce Department.  </P> <P> "It is generally accepted knowledge in Japan by Japanese and American scholars  that Japanese politicians receive monies in ways that would be unacceptable in  American politics," said Richard L. Drobnick, director of USC's International  Business Education and Research Program.  </P> <P> Influence buying of the type practiced by Recruit is commonplace, experts say,  in part because gift giving -- with the hope of receiving future good will and  possible favors in return -- is ingrained into Japanese traditions.  </P> <P> Also, industrial policy is highly centralized, with businesses requiring a  great deal of guidance from government officials on industrial policy and  regulation.  </P> <P> "To expand your business activities in Japan, it's important to work closely  with government officials much more so than in the United States," said Saburo  Oto, audit partner in the Japanese practice of the accounting firm of Touche  Ross.  </P> <P> Funding from businesses also is considered necessary for politicians to  operate. Japanese elected officials, unlike their American counterparts, are  expected to raise money not only to finance campaigns and support other  politicians, but also to pay their staffs, run their office and entertain  constituents and others.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Costly Customs  </P> <P> In addition, Japanese politicians also are expected to attend and bring gifts  to numerous weddings, funerals and other activities of constituents in their  home districts, the result of much tighter relationships than American  politicians are accustomed to, said Jack Lewis, an associate professor of  international business at USC.  </P> <P> "It's very costly compared to what is done in the United States," Lewis said.  </P> <P> A law enacted after the Tanaka-Lockheed scandal that set limits on corporate  contributions forced the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to reach beyond  established companies to new firms like Recruit for contributions.  </P> <P> And with tight relations forged between established business and government  leaders, breaking into such inner circles is tough for young up-and-coming  business leaders. It is made even tougher because one party, the LDP, still  dominates Japanese politics, and leaders of its various factions form a clubby  inner circle of Japan's leading decision makers. Couple that with the  industrial dominance of a few giant, decades-old conglomerates and trading  companies like Mitsubishi, Sony, Toyota and Mitsui.  </P> <P> "In Japan, they have strong ideas about who's on the inside and who's on the  outside," Lewis said. "If you are on the outside, like (Recruit founder) Ezoe,  you don't have much of a chance" unless you buy your way in with gifts.  </P> <P> That is what Ezoe is accused of trying to do. Recruit's diversification into  information services, computer leasing and real estate investment gained him a  high profile in Tokyo's business establishment. But he still lacked important  government contacts and influence that would help him rise further.  </P> <P> Some Japan experts say Recruit's actions may have gone by unnoticed and  tolerated had it not been done on such a large scale -- and had politicians not  initially tried to cover it up by denying involvement. An aide to Takeshita,  for example, had received a $381,000 loan from Recruit that, while not illegal  in Japan, damaged Takeshita's political standing because he failed to mention  it when explaining his involvement with Recruit before parliament earlier this  month.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Huge Profits for Many  </P> <P> All in all, about 150 politicians, bureaucrats and business leaders are  believed to have bought directly or indirectly discounted shares in Recruit  Cosmos, a property subsidiary, between 1984 and 1986. The company sold its  stock to the public in October, 1986, generating huge profits of as much as  twice what recipients paid.  </P> <P> Ezoe also gave Recruit Cosmos shares to prominent businessmen like Hisashi  Shinto, chairman of Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone, the world's largest  company. Ezoe hoped that Shinto would help Recruit enter lucrative computer and  telecommunications businesses. NTT subsequently helped Recruit obtain two giant  supercomputers from an American company, Cray Research.  </P> <P> "The rise of the company was so spectacular, and the amount of money thrown  around so great, it was the Japanese equivalent of the Michael Milken case in  the United States," said Frank Gibney, president of the Pacific Basin  Institute, a Santa Barbara think tank, noting the case of the American "junk  bond" king recently indicted for securities violations.  </P> <P> "They (Recruit) exceeded the norm, it was just too flagrant," Gibney said.  </P> <P> NTT's Shinto resigned last year. Prosecutors charged him in February with  taking a bribe in connection with about $80,000 in stock received from Recruit.  </P> <P> First details about the Recruit scandal were revealed last July by Asahi  Shimbun, a leading Japanese newspaper often critical of the government.  </P> <P> The scandal soon became a television spectacle, capped by the remarkable  instance of Hiroshi Matsubara, an aide to Recruit Chairman Ezoe, being  videotaped trying to bribe an opposition member of the Diet, Japan's  parliament, with cash so that he would not ask too many questions in an  investigation. The videotape was shown on national television.  </P> <P> "The energy with which the media went after Recruit is possible because it is  an outsider," said Gerald L. Curtis, director of the East Asian Institute at  Columbia University. "It's hard to imagine that a mainstream Sumitomo or  Mitsubishi would get that attention."  </P> <P> News of the influence buying enraged some Japanese already dissatisfied with  the government in general and Takeshita in particular, whose popularity ratings  have plummeted to less than 5% in part because of his support of an unpopular  3% consumption tax.  </P> <P> Japanese workers also are harboring growing resentments about how so little of  Japan's growing international wealth has trickled down to the average worker,  who still cannot afford to buy his own home or apartment. Thus they resented  top government and business leaders using their influence to profit on stock  deals.  </P> <P> "This is part of a consumers' revolt, it just took a different form," said  Gibney of the Pacific Basin Institute.  </P> <P> Whether the scandal will result in significant reforms remains to be seen, but  some experts are pessimistic that the system of influence peddling will die  completely.  </P> <P> "For there to be change, there will have to be a way to finance Japanese  politics that is not dependent on big business," said former Commerce official  Prestowitz. Also, he said, there may have to be changes in such things as the  tradition of politicians attending weddings and funerals, and of the close  relationship between business and government.  </P> <P> Such changes, he said, are so fundamental that they are unlikely in the near  future.  </P> <P> Pat Steinhoff, director of the Center for Japanese Studies at the University of  Hawaii, said she expects big Japanese companies will be even more careful in  how they make political contributions.  </P> <P> "The older and more established companies are sort of snickering that this  upstart company was so crude it got caught," Steinhoff said. "It will add to  the finesse of how big companies give money."  </P> <P> Times Staff Writer Nancy Yoshihara in Honolulu contributed to this story.  </P></p>

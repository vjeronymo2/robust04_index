			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Given the "notoriously tense" relations  between Minister of Foreign Affairs Karolos Papoulias and  alternate Minister of Foreign Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos, the  13 February Athens daily I KATHIMERINI questions whether the  latter will remain in place after Greece's term as European  Union president ends. The newspaper cites diplomats "in the  know" as saying that Pangalos will probably move to another  ministry. Meanwhile, other sources maintain that the alternate  minister will definitely not seek an appointment as European  Union commissioner, as was rumored late last year. According to  the newspaper, this means that the list of possible successors  to Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou would grow by yet another  strong candidate.</p>

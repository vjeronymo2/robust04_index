			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Private View: Nature ramble with Marx's gardener THE GHOST of Karl Marx will be hovering over its tombstone in Highgate Cemetery tonight, the eve of the great philosopher's death 110 years ago. It was a quirk of history that the bones of the father of world communism should come to rest not in the Kremlin wall but in a north London burial ground laid out by financial speculators and managed by a group of upper-middle-class English volunteer worthies. Marx is buried in the later, east wing of the famous cemetery. Among his comrades are Chubb the locksmith, Lobb the bootmaker, Foyle the bookseller, Smith of Hovis, Cruft of the dog show and Hutch the cabaret star. More congruously, there are Dr Dadoo, first chairman of the African National Congress, and Claudia Jones, a black freedom fighter. But Marx is old hat now, at least to the Friends of Highgate Cemetery who bought the place 17 years ago: they measure his value by the pounds they earn selling souvenir miniatures of the famous, bearded head. So it was not to Marx's grave but through the heavy iron gates that protect the mysterious and beautiful west wing - John Betjeman called it 'a Victorian Valhalla' - that the chairman of the Friends and guardian of the tombstones, Jean Pateman, conducted me last week. Pateman is not the type to shiver at a memento mori nor be cowed by the presence of the dead. She is one of those brisk, bossy women of ringing accent and good family (the Ouseley-Smiths of Cheshire) who in England love to sit on committees, raise money and run things. She talked about the cemetery rather as if showing off her own, rather overgrown, country-house garden ('don't walk on the vegetation if you don't mind]') and with that English kind of pride which is full of superlatives but from which all sentiment has been carefully scrubbed. 'You know,' she said, stopping to point out a stone angel weeping in the undergrowth 'this is a team effort. I'm just the girl who's bullied and stirred things along and promoted and driven and survived and . . . It's a very big business now,' she added triumphantly. Pateman is a mild name-dropper - it is part of her job, after all - and it was occasionally hard to tell whether the names she dropped were of the living or the dead. She discussed her famous supporters and tenants in the same tone, as if discussing invitations to a dinner party. ('Christopher Fry, our nicest, gentlest VIP, lovely man, absolutely charming . . . '). How, I wondered, would Michael Faraday, the Sandemanian scientist, get on with Joseph Frost, the Muggletonian, although both are buried in Dissenters' Corner? William Jeakes, inventor of the hospital drying machine, would certainly have something in common with that Dr Lee who decreed that hospital windows could be opened. The Rossettis and Galsworthys would hit it off. Tom Sayers, the prizefighter, could chat to George Wombwell, the menagerie owner, about his pet dog Lion and Wombwell's pet lion Nero. I should want to ask Sir James Tyler, of course. But do we dare put William Lillywhite, the round-arm bowler, next to Radclyffe Hall, the lesbian author  -especially if we have to invite her friend Mabel Veronica Batten as well? Burial appears to be coming back into vogue. I asked Pateman why. 'I believe there is an extraordinary psychological need that many people now feel to have something less austere and clinical and more in keeping with a proper ritual,' she said. Why do people choose to be buried rather than cremated? She sniffed. 'Why do some people enjoy pancakes and others prefer fresh fruit?' Highgate contains 51,800 graves and the bones or ashes of 166,800 people. The latest arrival, she told me, was 'a darling old boy of 94 who, for the last 17 years or so, always kissed my hand whenever we met: he was a colonel in the Polish air force.' The cemetery's popularity has soared, from 12 burials a year when the Friends took over to more than 80 a year. Space will have run out by the millennium and prices - Pounds 540 for cremated remains, or 'cremains,' Pounds 810 for a child's burial and between Pounds 2,200 and Pounds 6,850 for adults, according to the size of plot - will rise accordingly. You may not book in advance. The Friends describe Highgate as a nature reserve in a burial ground, and it was plain that the living receive as much as attention as the dead. As we climbed one of the paths, my guide listed the ground-covering plants: wild garlic and Russian comfrey, periwinkle, lady's-mantle, wood-spurge and dusky cranesbill, orange hawkweed, campion, Jacob's ladder and lung-wort. Above us, a sycamore forest which had given way to ash woodland was being cut to let in holly, yew and hawthorn, with plantings of lime, alder, hornbeam, willow and aspen, and oak to attract the insects: 'About 286 different insects inhabit an oak, you know.' It is a place, she said, for 'owl prowls and fungal forays' where arachnologists, herpetologists and lepidopterists flourish. There are foxes in the underbrush but the screaming peacocks disappeared some while ago - strangled, probably, by the neighbours. Its recent human visitors have included art students who came to draw the monuments, mausoleums and catacombs, a party of funeral directors from Belgium, restorers on their way to advise in Poland, landscape architects from Italy, Norway and Finland, social historians and film researchers. The Friends are squeamish about letting Highgate be used for horror films, but many TV documentaries have exploited its photogenic atmosphere. Conservation is a controversial business. Here, the policy is to patch up rather than restore, Pateman explained as we circled the neo-Egyptian necropolis that crowns the cemetery. It is the 'ruin-as-found' technique. She began to elaborate, then broke off. 'That's Beatrix Potter's publisher through there, by the way.' When I mentioned the ivy draped in Gothic profusion over the monuments, it seemed to touch a raw nerve. 'I'm not going to be drawn into the ivy debate,' she said, firmly. 'There are three factors: it is a unifying factor, it acts as a concealing agency, and it is a habitat for spiders. It harbours the birds, of course . . .' And it looks nice? 'Exactly. And it is only damaging to the softer stones.' Apart from anything else, it would take armies of people to remove it all and it would look perfectly horrifying.' She indicated another grieving angel, gleaming white. 'The grave-owners came and gave it a jolly good cleaning. Now, we can't say 'please don't clean' though we can say 'don't bring any acid because it'll spoil the plants nearby . . . But it does look a little incongruous. So does this . . .' She pointed to an obelisk on the pathway, then checked herself and praised the generosity of the shipping company P&amp;O which had restored the grave of Broddie McGhie Wilcox, an early partner of the line. Earlier, the chairman of the Friends had said she was too busy looking after the living - there are 75,000 human visitors a year - to feel the presence of the dead. 'But I'll tell you what I do feel. I feel afflicted by a great sense of awe that wherever we move there is great and profound distinction - the number of people who have made enormous strides in society. 'I mean, tucked away in there' (she pointed again) 'is the first person ever to use an anaesthetic in this country - he was a dentist - several days before the great operation at University College Hospital.' Did he demonstrate on himself and pass away in the process? I asked, facetiously. Pateman's eyebrows rose until they hit the band of her home-made toque. She gave me an old-fashioned look: 'No comment'. How would you like to end up, I asked her. She laughed: 'I should like to become a tree, I think.' Are you going to be buried? 'No, definitely not. Quite definitely not.' Why not? 'Because - and this is highly personal - I really feel that cremation is more hygienic and more appropriate and requires less space.' Isn't that odd after you've spent so many years and so much energy tending a graveyard? 'That's quite different,' she said. 'I was tipped in here because I happened to be serving on the environment committee of the Highgate Society. I came here very reluctantly.' Eventually, she admitted that she would not object if her 'cremains' were deposited at Highgate. What inscription would you have on your tombstone? ''The old girl worked here', or something like that, I should think.' She laughed. Myself, I guess they will do better for her than that.</p>

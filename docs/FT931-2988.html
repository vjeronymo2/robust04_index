			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Voluntary sector disappointed by the give and take - Charities TAX RELIEF on two of the government's main vehicles for trying to stimulate charitable support - Payroll Giving and Gift Aid - will be extended under measures announced yesterday. But in spite of these welcome boosts, voluntary sector leaders were last night disappointed about the wider effects of the budget. Both the imposition of VAT on fuel and power and proposed reductions in tax credits on dividends will have a serious impact. The annual tax relief limit for employees' donations to charity under payroll deduction schemes will rise from Pounds 600 to Pounds 900 from next month. At the same time, the Chancellor announced that single gifts of Pounds 250 or more will in future qualify for tax relief under Gift Aid - the current minimum is Pounds 400. Mr Lamont estimated that the changes would increase tax relief on donations to charity by around Pounds 30m in a full year. Even if this proves correct, however, Britain's big charities stand to lose a similar amount as a result of the decision to impose VAT on fuel and power. The Charities Tax Reform Group, which represents many of the larger charities, calculates that its 300 affiliated organisations will lose Pounds 27m a year as a result of the decision. Mr Adrian Randall, the group's chairman, contrasted the government's failure to exempt charities from VAT on fuel and power with its proposed VAT support to the racehorse industry. 'What is more important - horses or people?' he asked. The reform group fears that the tax credit reduction will eventually have an even more severe effect. Although it will be phased in over four years for charities, it says the change will eventually cost the sector an annual Pounds 100m. Mr Lamont announced yesterday that tickets in the forthcoming National Lottery will be taxed at 12 per cent in the first year of operationr. However, the chancellor said the tax rate would be kept under review. The National Council for Voluntary Organisations had campaigned for a 5 per cent tax rate, and many charity managers fear the lottery will divert money that might otherwise have gone into direct charitable support.</p>

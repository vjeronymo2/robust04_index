			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Arts: Contemporary and Russian sounds - Concerts in Barcelona and London The Spanish savings bank 'la Caixa', based in Barcelona, supports a diversity of concerts, including an early music festival now in its 16th year, and has just started a contemporary music festival. Looking at once to international celebrity and local talent, this inaugural venture featured the music of America's senior composer Elliott Carter (86 in December) and of the notable Barcelona-born (in 1935) and based composer, Josep Soler. The first of the concerts I attended was given by the London Sinfonietta and its new chief conductor Markus Stenz in the Fundacio la Caixa's Centre Cultural. Carter's 1981 settings for tenor and ensemble of six sonnets by Robert Lowell, In Sleep, in Thunder (a Sinfonietta commission), came across in their marvellous intricacy with pungent force if not much tonal beauty, a lack due not only to the acoustics but to something insistently plain-voiced about the otherwise impressively deft singer Jon Garrison and to something stubbornly unlyrical in Carter's nonetheless intelligent vocal writing. Josep Soler was represented by a short neo-classical concerto for harpsichord and five instruments which he wrote in 1969 to complement the famous work by Falla and which the Sinfonietta recorded back in 1976. The soloist, John Constable, conducting from the keyboard, secured a lively account of this sweetly bristling 12-tone music, though one discovered from next evening's concert that the taut idiom no longer reflects Soler's approach. His Dos poemes per a orquestra (1990-93), performed by the Orquestra simfonica de Barcelona nacional de Catalunya under Josep Pons, proved a somewhat neo-romantic affair, the first practically a concerto for pastoral oboe and rustling curtain of divisi muted strings with unlikely touches from synthesised organ; the second whipping things up a bit with a wind machine. Soler's language seems to have become dangerously eclectic, dicing with kitsch. The two big movements of Elliott Carter's 1965 piano concerto were complex not in a playful but a geometrical way; a dense, often dark labyrinth. The American Ursula Oppens was the staggeringly dauntless, highly experienced soloist. Pons and the orchestra, with its concertino group gathered round the piano, performed with truly admirable courage and conviction, though never approaching an ideal balance of forces and seldom finding the ease and confidence to animate their jaggedly expressive polyphonic lines rather than just execute them. Earlier in the week Oppens gave the Spanish premiere of a five-minute piano piece, 90+, which Carter recently added to his ongoing series of luminous little tributes to colleagues, in this case the nonagenarian Italian composer Goffredo Petrassi. Pitched at a technical level which should not exclude the gifted amateur, it is a perfect epitome of Carter's dazzling metrical style and is built on 90 repetitions of the same pulsation, and then some more, as though to wish Petrassi a few years yet of active life. One certainly wishes Carter the same: he has just completed an orchestral piece for next year's Proms and is at work on a voice and piano song-cycle for next year's Aldeburgh Festival. *** Russian music of very diverse character was played in two concerts on consecutive evenings at the Royal Festival Hall by two orchestras, both conducted by Russians. On Tuesday the Royal Philharmonic under its principal conductor Yuri Temirkanov gave a neatly contrasted, slightly daring programme which began with Prokofiev's Suite, Op. 33a from his 1919 opera, The Love for Three Oranges. These six, wonderfully crisp and witty movements were executed with panache. Rachmaninov's three Symphonic Dances Op. 45 of 1941 were brought off well enough but seemed all the more jadedly conservative with the concert's marvellous middle item, the Concerto for Piano and Strings (1979) by a living Russian, Alfred Schnittke, still echoing in the mind. This often harshly dissonant work, Schnittke's third piano concerto, in this superbly thoughtful, elegantly shaped, powerful account, with soloist Dmitri Alexeev, came over as no more alienating than a darker piece by Sir Malcolm Arnold. The music, like Arnold's, touches on jazz and the RPO's principal double bass, Jack McCormack, plucked out his cabaret tones with style. Though the concerto does, indeed, have its violent outbursts, they are only some of the strangely assorted collection of musical objects - including a quiet Moonlight Sonata-like triplet figure for piano, a near-pastiche of the Russian Hymn from the 1812 overture, and a glissandoing string passage - which Schnittke's apparently zany but actually ironclad argument shows to be all of a piece. Alexeev and Temirkanov held one enthralled by the music's sheer dialectic. On Wednesday the BBC Symphony Orchestra under its principal guest conductor Alexander Lazarev gave the UK premiere of the single movement Symphony No 7 (1986) by the Armenian composer Alfred Terteryan (born 1929). His music is folk-influenced in a far from picturesque way. Here he writes an obbligato part for the folk percussion instrument called the dap' (Timothy Darside), which sounded not unlike the Indian tabla. This sound was often multiplied 10 or 11 times by the percussion department, or echoed by a tape recording. A sort of musical prophecy of the Armenian earthquake of 1988, the symphony deals wholly in monolithic and austere ritual gestures, minimalist in material whilst maximalist in rhetorical power. A far cry from Schnittke's irony, but a cry deserving of attention.</p>

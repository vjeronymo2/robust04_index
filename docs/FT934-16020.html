			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Second bite at the apple: Benazir Bhutto's election success Pakistan's general election, called to break prolonged political deadlock, has failed to produce the desired result. Ms Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister, has defeated her bitter rival and successor in office, Mr Mohammed Nawaz Sharif. But, with just 86 seats in the 217-member national assembly, her Pakistan People's Party lacks an overall majority and must seek other parties' support. Ms Bhutto's margin of success seems too narrow to assure Pakistan of the stable government it needs if it is to solve its political, social and economic difficulties. As one senior former minister said yesterday: 'A hung parliament is a political and economic disaster.' The main consolation is that the poll was completed with little of the bloodshed which often accompanies Pakistani elections; thanks to army supervision, it was also largely free of vote-rigging. The verdict therefore seems to be a true reflection of the people's wishes. The pity is that the result gives the winner a difficult hand to play. Ms Bhutto's delicate position is the consequence of long-term army involvement in politics. Born out of the bloody partition of India, Pakistan has always lived in the threatening shadow of its huge neighbour. The army has dominated public life and military dictators have ruled Pakistan for 24 out of its 46 years in existence. Of its civilian prime ministers only one has completed a five-year term - Ms Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the feudal landowner from the southern province of Sind. Hopes were high that Ms Bhutto could follow his example when she first took power in 1988 after the death of the dictator General Zia Ul Haq. But the army and bureaucracy's refusal to co-operate, combined with her own mishandling of relations with the military and the president, Mr Ghulam Ishaq Khan, brought Ms Bhutto down in 1990. Mr Sharif, an industrialist hand-picked for government by the army, ran into the same trouble this year  -and was forced to resign by the generals. Ms Bhutto's prospects of establishing power more firmly this time rely primarily on creating better relations with the army and with the bureaucracy headed by the president. She believes her chances are better because the generals are no longer as hostile as in 1988. The new army chief of staff, General Abdul Waheed, who took office in February, is considered relatively unpolitical. Also, Mr Khan, the president who opposed her in 1988-90, was this year sacked by the army at the same time as Mr Sharif for his part in causing political chaos. A new president will be elected in polls in November. As Ms Bhutto said in a recent FT interview: 'The (power) structure that was there has mercifully changed quite radically today.' However, what has not changed is the mutual hostility between her and Mr Sharif, whose Pakistan Moslem League (Nawaz) party (PML) will form the opposition. Their hostility to each other poisons the atmosphere and distorts decision-making. For example, both leaders promised voters constitutional amendments to reinforce the prime ministership by curbing the president's powers. But Mr Sharif is now unlikely to co-operate in a move which would only strengthen Ms Bhutto. Ms Bhutto's last government was also hampered by conflicts between the federal authorities in Islamabad and Punjab, the richest and most populous of the four provinces and the heart of Mr Sharif's power. When provincial polls are held on Saturday, it seems likely that Punjab will stay in Mr Sharif's hands. Mr Sharif, Pakistan's first businessman-prime minister, has left behind a mixed legacy. He promoted economic deregulation, foreign trade and investment. But his policies were marred by over-spending on projects such as a Dollars 1bn motorway; over-borrowing; and an upsurge in corruption. Also, the end of US and Soviet involvement in the Afghan war left Pakistan almost alone in coping with the effects of the conflict - including continuing fighting in Afghanistan and the spread into Pakistan of arms and drugs. Pakistan's international isolation increased due to worry over its nuclear programme - a concern which prompted the US to cancel aid. Ms Bhutto says her first priorities now are promoting economic growth and ending Pakistan's isolation. Her economic options are limited by the decisions taken by Mr Moeen Qureshi, caretaker prime minister. Mr Qureshi has been forced to seek emergency loans from the International Monetary Fund to ease a foreign exchange crisis caused partly by Mr Sharif's profligacy and by last year's floods. These have led to a slowdown in economic growth from an annual average of 6 per cent to just 3 per cent in the year to June 1993. Mr Qureshi's IMF-approved programme consists of devaluation combined with raising revenues by introducing agriculture taxes, clamping down on corruption, and squeezing tax dodgers, defaulters on loans from state banks and non-payers of utility bills. Ms Bhutto pledges to continue with Mr Qureshi's programme, including the agriculture tax, though she has expressed reservations about his proposals for its implementation. But her conservative, landowner-dominated party may drag its feet on this and other measures. Many of Mr Qureshi's measures are implemented via ordinances which will lapse unless confirmed by the national assembly. Public finances are burdened by military spending and debt repayments which together absorb about three-quarters of the budget. Since neither can be easily cut the chief route to stabilising public finances is through raising revenue, as Mr Qureshi has recognised. The hurdle is the belief of many politicians that the rewards of office include personal enrichment. This disregard for the law has given rise to a black economy estimated to be half the size of the official one. It is difficult to see how Pakistan can generate enough funds for education, health and other social programmes without bringing more of the black economy into the tax net. Without better education, improved health and population control will be largely unachievable. Ms Bhutto's PPP is the self-proclaimed party of the poor; it remains to be seen whether they benefit from her rule. As for international relations, Ms Bhutto sees rebuilding ties with the US as a top priority, including addressing Washington's complaints about alleged state terrorism, the nuclear programme and Pakistan's support for insurgents in the troubled Indian state of Kashmir. The difficulty lies is squaring US demands with domestic pressures - such as a powerful pro-nuclear lobby. Ms Bhutto says that with the elections over, she will fight the 'battle for the progress of Pakistan'. The danger is that she may be overwhelmed, as she was before, by the battle for progress in Islamabad.</p>

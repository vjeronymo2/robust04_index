			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (3): The strange effect of elections in Italy - First a surge, then the market slips back Elections do strange things to equity markets, and Italy in 1994 has proved no exception to this rule. Immediately after the victory of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's right-wing alliance in March, the Italian stock market surged ahead on the strength of bold campaign promises to re-energise the Italian economy and press forward with the privatisation programme launched by previous technocratic governments. The Comit index of principal stocks rose from just under 700 to more than 800 by the beginning of May. But concern about the implementation of those promises and the coherence of the Berlusconi coalition has taken its toll on financial markets. By mid- September the Comit index was back below 670. Companies and the government initially hurried to take advantage of the favourable conditions to raise capital. Since January this year, rights issues and privatisations in Italy have raised nearly L25,000bn, of which nearly L10,000bn is represented by state sell-offs. Unfortunately for those planning equity offerings, there was a vertiginous gap between inspiration and execution, and certain companies and their advisers found themselves in the painful position of having to straddle that gap. Even as company executives were tiring themselves out on international road shows to promote their offers, the market was undermining their best hopes about pricing. Two of the biggest international issues planned this year - a L1,500bn offer of shares and warrants by Medio- banca, the merchant bank, and the L1,650bn share issue by Cariplo, Italy's biggest savings bank - were postponed at the last minute when market cond- itions turned against them. Those which went ahead were also punished. The privatisation of Ina, the state-owned insurer, raised more than L4,800bn for the Italian Treasury in June, but when its shares began trading they rarely rose above the issue price of L2,400, and were less than L2,250 by mid-September. Iri, the state holding company, successfully sold its remaining 54 per cent stake in Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) in March with a L2,900bn international offer, but the bank disappointed the market less than three months later when it announced plans to raise more than L2,300bn of extra capital through a discounted rights issue. The first L1,575bn tranche of this issue has been successfully completed, judging from indications as this survey was going to press, but the shares were trading this month at around L3,600 compared with L5,341 before the intention to raise capital was revealed. Analysts are careful to point out, however, that companies such as Mediobanca and Cariplo did not need to raise capital. Mediobanca's issue of shares, for example, was partly aimed at diluting the 50 per cent holding of the bank's traditional shareholders to about 40.6 per cent, thus widening the ownership of its shares. In addition, a distinction should be made between international and institutional demand for these issues, and domestic public demand. In recent months, there have been definite signs of issue fatigue among the Italian public, but international investors - some of whom wanted to boost their exposure to Italian equities - remain broadly receptive to big issues. Mr Vittorio Pignatti- Morano of Lehman Brothers in Milan - joint global co-ordinator of the BCI issue - says there is always the option of lowering the price or scaling down the amount of shares to entice the institutional investor to buy. 'The real problem is the public offer for sale,' he says. 'They either buy or they don't buy, and the retail banks (which help market the public share offer) are still learning.' Mr Pignatti-Morano points out, for example, that when public demand turned out to be lower than expected for another issue co-ordinated by Lehman - the L130bn international offer of shares in Finanza &amp; Futuro, a financial services company - the company simply asked Consob, Italy's stock market watchdog, if it could restructure the deal so that more shares went to international institutions. However, the Berlusconi government is still cautious about forthcoming priv- atisations, which should include the sale of shares in Enel, the electricity generator; Stet, the telecommunications holding company; and Eni, the oil, gas and chemicals holding company. Not only are these the largest of the state-owned companies being considered for sale, they are also among the most complex and politically the most sensitive. For example, recent ministerial statements have clearly pushed Enel to the front of the queue for privatisation. But before such a move can be made, Mr Vito Gnutti, the industry minister, and his colleagues must win political consensus about how to execute such a sale (for example, whether the different functions of the company should be split up to be sold separately) and what sort of regulatory authority should supervise the electricity sector. In the meantime, the government may learn from some of the setbacks of the past few months. Mr Berlus- coni is acutely sensitive to the international judgment of his administration, particularly in economic matters. Analysts hope and believe that he will think twice before attempting to foist privatised equity on foreign institutions at inflated prices.</p>

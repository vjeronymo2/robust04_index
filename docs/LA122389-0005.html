Grundig began tinkering with  radios as a 15-year-old apprentice in the Bavarian city of Nuremberg. He opened  his own shop with a friend in 1930, selling radios and producing transformers.  After World War II, Grundig was permitted by the Allies to relocate his  business to Fuerth, where he set up his own factory to produce radio parts. His  company was one of the first to produce frequency modulated (FM) radios,  cutting out static interference for clearer reception. In 1952, Grundig was one  of the first European companies to start producing TV sets. During the 1960s,  Grundig began setting up foreign branches.

Grundig was forced to close 11  plants and cut its work force from 35,000 to 29,000. In 1984, the Dutch Philips  group bought nearly a one-third share and took over the management. The firm,  which still bears his name, has annual sales of more than $1.7 billion. In  Baden-Baden, West Germany, on Dec. 8 of unannounced causes.  </P></p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Books: Movie anecdotes FRED ZINNEMANN: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY by Fred Zinnemann Bloomsbury Pounds 25, 254 pages LIFE IS TOO SHORT by Mickey Rooney Hutchinson Pounds 16.99, 367 pages NO MINOR CHORDS by Andre Previn Doubleday Pounds 14.99, 148 pages CRONENBERG ON CRONENBERG edited by Chris Rodley Faber Pounds 12.99, 190 pages MOVIE autobiographies are one of the mysteries of the age. Why do sensible people like you or I squander our hard-earned book tokens on the burblings of Filmdom's famous, few of whom can string together a cogent literate sentence? Yet whenever stars and directors let the air out of their egos in print, they find a queue of fans anxious for the exhalations. Fred Zinnemann's new autobiography helps to explain why. Although at first glance the book seems little more than 200 pages of mild-mannered reminiscence, which 'grew out of conversations with the film critic Alexander Walker', there are seams of gold. First, the reminiscences are adorned with photographs, many taken by Zinnemann or from his own collection. Here are the visual footnotes to movie history: Gary Cooper lunching on location with the cast and crew of High Noon (his frowning gaze zeroes in on what looks like gopher stew and dumplings); Jane Fonda in Julia playing a scene with an unknown newcomer called Meryl Streep; an unknown camera assistant called Nicolas Roeg, later to direct Don't Look Now, looking pensive on the set of The Sundowners; a not-unknown Frank Sinatra acting up between takes on From Here To Eternity . . . Minor revelations, but they add up. So do the trouvailles in the text. Did you know that Zinnemann was an extra in All Quiet On The Western Front? That Harry Cohn once defined a documentary as 'a picture without women.' That Joan Crawford was first choice for Deborah Kerr's saucy role in From Here To Eternity? That the Method-trained Rod Steiger unbalanced Oklahoma] in Zinnemann's view by acting too sympathetically as the pantomimic villain Jud. That Zinnemann walked out on directing Hemingway's The Old Man And The Sea when the studio wanted to use a motor-driven dummy marlin? Anecdotes. But the anecdotes work at recontouring film history. They may also recontour Fred Zinnemann's place in that history. Not because the author blows trumpets on his own behalf: his style is as self-effacing with pen as with camera. But Zinnemann's undervalued moral honesty, also as evident on page as on screen, looks more appealing as time moves on. High Noon, his best film, was once the butt of right-wing ridicule for its syndicalist-socialist picture of a sheriff who needed - or thought he needed  -his townspeople's aid to quash the incoming baddies. Howard Hawks, outraged at this insult to the lonely hero of Western myth, made Rio Bravo as a riposte: a film in which John Wayne goes around town refusing people's help. But today, like all Zinnemann's best work, High Noon has the simplicity and integrity of great realism. It is the film of a man who grew up knowing tyranny, in an Austria threatened with Nazism, and who learned that popular entertainment could be as potent a weapon as any in fighting it. The 'Why do we buy?' test applied to Mickey Rooney's Life Is Too Short gets a different answer. Yes, here is cinema history re-mapped. We have candid pal's-eye glimpses of Judy Garland, Ava Gardner (first wife), Frank Sinatra (first wife's third husband) and others in that incestuous Lotusland we call Hollywood. But no, this autobiography tells us nothing about Rooney himself except that being Irish he will talk you into the floorboards. The writing style is out of another Mickey (Spillane) by the News of the World. 'Cannons exploded in my brain. When the cannons stopped, I leaned over and embraced Ava. I moved my lips close to hers and then, for the first time, she opened her mouth to mine and we tasted each other. I explored her mouth and she explored mine. Our passion grew . . .' Soon with one bound they are tearing off each other's filmy garments and declaring eternal love. The marriage lasted just under a year. Why do we buy this book? Because beneath the catchpenny style and revolving-door romances there are peer-group glimpses of the famous or fascinating - Gable, Chaplin, Astaire, the young Elizabeth Taylor - that we will find nowhere else. Andre Previn's No Minor Chords needs no cine-archaeologist's reason to read. This portrait of the artist as a young Hollywood composer (1948-1964) is mischievously entertaining. Previn, who bears a physical resemblance to a mouse in search of high-quality cheese, knows a tasty story too. As in Rooney's book, everyone in and around Hollywood seems to connect up with everyone else. Here are LB Mayer trashing Jascha Heifetz ('He shouldn't play pieces no one's ever heard of]' he grumbles after hearing the Sibelius Violin Concerto at the Hollywood Bowl); the penny-pinching Heifetz himself holding a yard sale of the gifts he has received on concert tours; Heifetz's friend Arnold Schoenberg all but setting the dog on Previn after being beaten by him at ping-pong . . . Plus Sam Goldwyn delivering Goldwynisms, art connoisseur Billy Wilder being chastised by his wife for buying Egon Schieles ('Good God, Billy, just once can't you buy a landscape') and Vincente Minnelli having a peacock poked in the behind so it will fan its tail for a crucial scene in Gigi. All human life, and more. It is a far cry from the cerebral memoirs of scream specialist David Cronenberg. In Cronenberg On Cronenberg the director of The Fly, Dead Ringers and the forthcoming Naked Lunch talks about the art of horror, the horror of art (in his native Canada) and the reason why it does us good to contemplate murder, mutilation and mutation. Why should you buy this book? Because it shows that 'down-market' movie genres can sometimes be explored and enriched by an up-market movie intelligence.</p>

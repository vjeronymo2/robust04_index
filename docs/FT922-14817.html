			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / UK Company News: Leading UK and European institutions to shun WMI SEVERAL LEADING UK and European institutions have decided to shun the Pounds 465m flotation of Waste Management International (WMI) which enters its last lap next week. Despite heavy pressure from Cazenove and Merrill Lynch, brokers and lead underwriter respectively, the institutions say they will avoid the international offer and placing of 20 per cent of the shares in WMI, the overseas arm of Waste Management Inc, the leading US waste disposal company. However, demand from the US is expected to be strong enough to allow the flotation to be successfully completed. The UK institutions are worried about the high indicated price of the shares and the ambitious growth assumptions made for WMI in the issue prospectus. One London-based fund manager said: 'They are over-priced and over here.' European investors have also expressed concern about the timing of the flotation in light of the uncertain outlook for equities ahead of the UK general election. The shares are due to be priced in the US on Monday night, before preliminary dealings begin on Tuesday. UK fund managers said yesterday the price for the UK placing was likely to be around 620p, against an indicated range of 530-645p. That would value the whole of WMI at Pounds 2.3bn and put the shares on a multiple of 34 times the pro-forma 1991 earnings per share. However, the company expects to show rapid earnings growth in the next few years, which will bring the multiple down to less demanding levels. US investors are reportedly keen to switch into the fast-growing overseas subsidiary of the US parent, WM Inc. Since the beginning of March, shares in WM Inc have fallen from Dollars 43 to below Dollars 38 as funds have sold ahead of the WMI flotation. They are more comfortable with the high earnings multiple on the new shares, and have the additional protection of the dollar's strength against sterling. Some UK funds said they will buy the WMI shares, but intend to sell them in early dealings. The proximity of the planned sale of a further large tranche of shares in Wellcome, the drugs company, to which Cazenove is also the broker, has made some investors nervous that if they refuse to participate in the WMI sale they will prejudice their applications for Wellcome stock.

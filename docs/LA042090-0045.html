			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PELLI CLARIFIES POSITION ON TRUMP PROJECT  </P> <P> My views as presented in Leon Whiteson's article ("Skyscrapers: From Here to  Eternity," March 27) are correct on the general issues, but not as they address  Donald Trump's proposed project for the Ambassador Hotel site. I do not  remember ever being interviewed on the matter, of which I know very little.  </P> <P> If these comments were taken from the question and answer session after my  recent lecture at Cal Poly Pomona in Los Angeles, then my views were part of a  general exchange in which the audience had much more to say than I did on the  matter. I don't remember uttering the expressions attributed to me.  </P> <P> First, I began by saying that I know very little about the project. Second, I  said that a commercial development in the mid-Wilshire District would be vastly  more appropriate than a school. Third, when asked about a proposed full-fledged  shopping center, I wondered about its feasibility in a location so far from the  freeways. Now I understand that the proposed mass transit system has a stop on  the site.  </P> <P> Fourth, I never spoke of a prime historic section of Wilshire Boulevard. Except  for the hotel itself, there is not much left of any historic value. Fifth,  although I have fond personal memories of the building, it is not one of  significant architectural value. Sixth, I have the greatest respect for Donald  Trump's abilities as a developer. I would not pretend to have more wisdom than  he does about the project. Seventh, it is obvious that a healthy ego is a  required quality in attempting a project of that scope.  </P> <P> Eighth and last of all, not only am I not against the project, I would have  been happy to serve as the architect, although I believe he has retained the  quite capable firm of Pereira Associates for this undertaking.  </P> <P> I hope these statements clarify my views on the matter.  </P> <P> CESAR PELLI, New Haven, Conn.  </P> <P> Editor's Note: Leon Whiteson interviewed Cesar Pelli privately, as well as  attending the lecture at Cal Poly Pomona.  </P></p>

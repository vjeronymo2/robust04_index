			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US blue chips ease as investors consolidate Wall Street IN SPITE of more good economic news, US share prices were mixed across the board yesterday as investors consolidated recent gains and searched for fresh incentives to buy, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.51 at 3,328.67. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.03 up at 442.55, another record close, while the Nasdaq composite gained 3.35 at 705.12. Trading volume on the New York SE was 271m shares. After Monday's big advance, the market opened in a cautious mood, with blue chip prices easing slightly as some investors took the opportunity to book profits from recent gains. Although the outlook for the economy continues to brighten, providing underlying support for stock market sentiment, yesterday's economic figures, although bullish, failed to give shares a lift. The day's data consisted of a 1.9 per cent rise in the December leading index of economic indicators and a 6.3 per cent gain in December new home sales. Both increases were bigger than analysts had expected, and were consistent with other recent data which have painted a picture of a recovering economy. Equity prices may have been weighed down by the bond market, which suffered losses across the maturity range yesterday. Recent rises in bond prices have pushed interest rates to six-year lows, so any reversal in the trend was likely to lead to a negative reaction from the stock markets. Individual stocks continued to be affected by fourth-quarter earnings announcements. Tenneco climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 41 7/8 after the natural gas, and farming and construction equipment manufacturer unveiled fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 35m, up from Dollars 26m a year earlier. Pepsico slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 41 3/4 in busy trading after it announced fourth-quarter profits of Dollars 265.6m, compared with Dollars 221m at the same stage of 1991. Both sets of figures, however, were affected by restructuring or accounting charges. The ADRs in Hanson, the UK-based conglomerate, lost Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 18 7/8 after union workers began a strike at the group's Peabody Coal subsidiary, the largest coal producer in the US. Leading drug issues took a beating. Pfizer declined Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 63 1/8 and Merck Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 37 5/8: both stocks were removed from the recommended list at Salomon Brothers, the big Wall Street securities house. The news depressed the rest of the drugs sector, with Bristol-Myers Squibb weakening Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 58 1/4, Schering-Plough Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 58 3/4 and Johnson &amp; Johnson Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 43 5/8 . Colgate-Palmolive rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 58 1/4 after it was added to the Salomon recommended list, on the grounds that the stock has growth potential. On the Nasdaq market, Lone Star Steakhouse jumped Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 41 3/4 in busy trading after the company unveiled plans to accelerate its rate of new store openings this year. Lone Star also said it was comfortable with analysts' forecasts that earnings would reach 85 cents a share in 1993. Canada TORONTO showed no clear trend after heavy trading. The TSE 300 index was up 10.9 at 3,321.8, but declines held a slight edge over rises by 316 to 305. Volume amounted to 46.5m shares valued at CDollars 420.9m. Nine of the 14 stock groups were higher, with the golds sector adding 1.09 per cent. LAC Minerals, CDollars  3/8 firmer at CDollars 6 1/2 , reported higher fourth-quarter earnings.</p>

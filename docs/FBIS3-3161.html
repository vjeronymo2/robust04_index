			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Xie Mi: "Laidoff To Benefit From Plan"] </F>   [Text] The Ministry of Labour plans to start a  re-employment programme for those who have been out of work for  more than six months. It should help get people off the welfare  rolls and relieve the State's financial burden of taking care of  them.    Last year, 900,000 workers were laid off, mostly from firms  that restructured or went bankrupt. The figure for 1992 was  350,000. The dramatic rise is partly attributed to enterprise  reform.    More unemployed people means that workers have had to work  harder -- and wait longer -- to find a new job, said Zhang Xin  of the ministry's employment department.    He said that before 1992 most people would find work within  five months. Now the wait often exceeds six months, costing the  government dearly in unemployment pay.    Statistics indicate that in the first half of last year the  nation's jobless received 108 million yuan ($12.4 million) in  unemployment insurance benefits, compared with 130 million yuan  ($14.9 million) between 1987 and 1992.    But the country's unemployment insurance fund -- supported  by  government appropriations and corporate contributions -- is  limited. Last year it was about 3 billion yuan ($345 million).    Unemployed workers get 75 yuan ($8.5) per month. Those with  less than one year's working experience are not eligible for  unemployment benefits; those who have worked one to five years  get benefits for 12 months; and those with more than five years  get benefits for up to 24 months.    According to the ministry's programme, people out of work  for  more than six months have to attend a monthly conference  sponsored by local labour service departments.    If they fail to attend, their welfare benefits will be cut  off.    At the meetings, officials will issue labour market  information. provide job-hunting tips and offer re-employment  training services.    They also issue recommendation letters to enterprises  indicating the kind of training the workers received.    For those who have been unemployed for more than a year,  authorities will organize meetings between enterprises and the  jobless.    Companies that hire the unemployed workers will get  unemployment insurance from labour departments to cover part of  the worker's salary. Enterprises can also employ people on a  three-month trial basis.    Efforts are underway to expand unemployment insurance to all  city employees, but at present only unemployed workers dismissed  by firms that have gone bankrupt or have merged are eligible for  unemployment insurance.    If workers attend the re-employment programmes and still  fail  to find jobs, they get insurance for another three months.    Workers can get preferential policies when paying taxes and  applying for bank loans if they decide to find jobs by  themselves.    "This programme is also an effort to transform the  government's functions," Zhang said. "In the past, laid off  people were usually assigned by labour departments to other  units. But now we do not enjoy the same administrative power so  we are providing re- employment services."    The programme is expected to begin on a trial basis next  month in Liaoning, Shandong, Zhejiang, Fujian, Henan, Hebei,  Hunan, Guangdong, Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces as well as in  Shanghai.    If it is successful, it will likely be promoted nationwide  in  1995.</p>

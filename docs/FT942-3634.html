			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Training at long distance CD-Rom and cheap personal computers are increasingly providing large companies with an alternative to formal training through taught courses. The combination of voice, video, text and graphics allows managers to interact with the 'computer-tutor' in a way that is proving effective and popular. For large organisations the ability to offer staff this so-called 'distance learning' is also cheap. Managers do not need to be ferried to training centres and housed. And once the course has been paid for, the company has a re-usable resource. Now the opportunity to take advantage of this so-called distance learning is available to smaller companies. Some CD-Rom-based multimedia management courses can already be rented through TECs and training colleges. Business Link Southern Derbyshire is one of several local business support agencies with titles available for rent on or off site. One company, Xebec Multi Media Solutions, a Gloucestershire-based company, is already providing multimedia courses which cover topics such as the management of tasks, leading teams and business communication. Its latest title, Money Business I, tackles the crucial question of how companies keep control of cashflow. Aimed at junior managers, the first module in the seven-hour course is little more advanced than the early training videos produced by Video Arts that featured John Cleese and Ronnie Corbett. However, later modules within the course show the power of multimedia. Students change assumptions in cashflow forecasts and look at the implications of large orders on a company's need for working capital. At Pounds 1,149, Xebec's Money Business course may not top every company's shopping list. But training via interactive multimedia systems is forecast to grow at a rapid rate.</p>

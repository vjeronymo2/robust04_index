			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Arts: Veteran painters in abstraction - Alan Green and Albert Irvin may not have won any prizes but their work is flourishing At 62 and 72 respectively, Alan Green and Albert Irvin qualify as veteran painters in the true sense of the word, 'grown old in service; experienced by long usage or practice; old soldiers.' More to the point, both are abstract painters, which to many, such is the current orthodoxy of critical debate, would seem to mark them out not so much as rare, but as irrelevant beasts indeed. On the one hand, the figurative-revisionist lobby comes close to arguing that abstraction was an aberrant and sterile sport in the development of modernism. On the other, we should remember that not since the 1960s has an abstract painter of any kind been our principle representative at the Venice Biennale; and not once has one won the Turner Prize, which in any case seems now, after seven such winners on the trot, to be reserved exclusively for sculptors. The truth is that once developed, abstraction was never going to go away. Moreover, from the hands of true artists from Mondrian to Pollock have come some of the most physically beautiful and certainly most characteristic works of our century. Here it flourishes, as it has done since the war, with many of our more interesting painters, young and old, as committed to it as ever - Fiona Rae, Alan Gouk, Basil Beattie, Bridget Riley, Trisha Gillman, Jennifer Durrant, Peter Joseph, Sean Scully, Terry Frost, Patrick Heron - the list is endless. Green and Irvin, although they have won no prizes, no public honours, no great retrospectives, are as distinguished as any of them. Between themselves, they could hardly present a greater contrast. Green is the more classical of the two, his work coming out of the constructivist tradition, architectural and rectilinear in its disposition, minimalist in its tendency. To describe it, even now when it has withdrawn from the more extreme simplicity of recent years, is almost to describe nothing - muted colours; close tones; the composition a matter of simple verticals and horizontals. But that says nothing of the richness of the surface, with its pigment worked so lovingly, raked and hoed like the richest soil, albeit a mere patch, a pocket handkerchief. These are small paintings, yet the vigour so evident in their working gives them a physical presence quite disproportionate to their scale. All, so far, is on the surface, to be relished as the surface - texture, colour and tone all singing together in close and silent harmony, 'for there is a musick wherever there is a harmony, order or proportion', as old Thomas Browne said. But there is more to them than that, for these are pictures: all their surface and physical qualities have pictorial and imaginative qualities to complement them. All abstract painting has a sense of landscape to it, by the simple fact that even a single mark laid upon a surface will work pictorially upon the imagination by the suggestion of space. An horizontal becomes an horizon, and any vertical interposed will articulate the space between. Are Green's horizontals, then, true horizons, his verticals and cross-members monumental structures, or are they only possibly such things? Are they even these things, and at the same time not these things at all? Such imaginative ambiguity is for us to reconcile. If Green is the classical, Albert Irvin is manifestly the romantic, and yet the point of the landscape possibilities of abstraction applies equally to him and his work. It is just that Turner rather than Mondrian is his hero, and the ambiguous suggestion is achieved by atmospheric clouds and sweeps of colour rather than by line. Music too comes into it, though Wagner and Verdi rather than Satie. It must be said that in recent years Irvin seems to have settled upon the major keys, and even the same tunes. The energy, the sheer gusto of the work, and the particular variations that inevitably follow notwithstanding, the formal structure he employs seem now to be set in a consistent pattern - a huge colour-field filled to a consistent density, flat up to the picture-plane, with blocks and circles overlaid cross-wise with broad swathes of clean, vivid colour. The physical excitement and delight he takes in the act of painting are infectious, and his technical control over so ebullient a temperament, exercised on so vast a scale, is remarkable. To note a formulaic quality, when an artist such as Green is clearly and necessarily formulaic, is therefore not to carp. But Irvin is so different, so openly intuitive and spontaneous in his approach, that one only wonders how considered, or unconsidered, his formula has become. Alan Green: small paintings; Annely Juda Fine Art, 23 Dering Street W1, until December 17. Albert Irvin: 30 Davies Street W1, until January 14.</p>

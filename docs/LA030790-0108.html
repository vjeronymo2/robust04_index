			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Rykoff-Sexton Inc.: Third-quarter profit fell to $610,000 from $4.5 million a  year ago.  </P> <P> Sales increased 8% to $343.4 million. The Los Angeles company said the results  reflected lower-than-anticipated sales increases, along with delays in cost  containment measures. Higher labor, rental, insurance and interest expenses  also contributed, as well as a non-recurring $2-million pretax charge related  to bad debt provisions and employee health-care benefits. Rykoff-Sexton Inc.  manufactures and distributes products to the food service industry.  </P></p>

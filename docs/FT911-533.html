			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Bank warning unsettles share prices A WARNING from the Bank of England that it does not want UK base rates to fall for the next two weeks, together with a batch of somewhat bearish reports to shareholders from leading British companies, took the heart out of the UK stock market yesterday. After challenging its all-time peak of FT-SE 2,545.3 in an early response to the gain of 40 Dow points on New York overnight, the London market turned down to close with a net fall of 17.5 on the day. The Bank of England's warning, conveyed by conventional signals to the London money markets, stressed that it wanted domestic rates to stay at 12 per cent for the next fourteen days. This period takes in May 17, the date on which a further fall in Britain's retail price index (RPI) is expected and consequently the date marked by City analysts as the likely day for a cut in base rates. 'This (the Bank's move) will be very depressing for some of the interest rate optimists,' commented Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull, although he added that an interest rate cut remains merely a question of timing. 'We still think base rates will be down to 11 1/2 per cent within the next month.' The early gain of 13.1 to 2,554.9 in the equity market was soon trimmed after Granada, the leisure and television group, hit the market with a widely-predicted rights issue call for Pounds 163m, together with a depressing trading report. The equity market has faced funding calls almost daily for the past three weeks as the Pounds 2bn rights issue list recorded in the first quarter of the year has been steadily increased during April and May. However, investment funds' cash holdings remain relatively high. The gloom hanging over the market increased as the session progressed and shareholders attending annual meetings of such leading UK companies as P &amp; O, Bowater, Hawker Siddeley and Pearson were all given warnings on the current state of business. At the session's low point, the Footsie was down by more than 19 points. However, by the close, the FT-SE Index had steadied at 2,524.3 for a net loss on the day of 17.5 points. Over the week, which is the first leg of the two week trading account, the market has moved very erratically as hopes for an early cut in base rates have ebbed and flowed; by last night, the gain on the week was a mere 1.4 points. With its hopes for a reduction in base rates next Friday now severely jolted, the equity market was looking subdued at the close of trading. However, there was little significant selling pressure yesterday and Seaq-recorded turnover of 423m shares was not the highest daily figure even for a week which has been accompanied by a return to very low trading levels. Trading volume has again fallen below last year's daily averages in the face of bearish views from British industry and a steady erosion of funds' cash holdings by right issues.</p>

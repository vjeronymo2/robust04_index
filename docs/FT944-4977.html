			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Mercury to cut 2,500 jobs after fall in profits: Loss-making services axed in Pounds 120m measure Mercury Communications, British Telecommunications' largest competitor in the UK, will cut 2,500 jobs, nearly a quarter of its workforce, over the next 12 months and withdraw loss-making services in an attempt to return to profits growth. The services to go include payphones, directory inquiries and the company's fledgling on-line services combining information and entertainment. The measures, widely expected after disappointing interim results last month, will cost the company Pounds 120m in the current financial year which ends next March, a Pounds 40m charge for job losses and Pounds 80m for asset write-downs linked with the job cuts. The company's interim profits fell Pounds 3m to Pounds 96m on revenues up 12 per cent at Pounds 797m. Mr Duncan Lewis, Mercury's newly-appointed chief executive, said yesterday that he believed the losses - 2,000 permanent jobs, mostly in administrative and support areas, and 500 contract and part-time positions out of a staff of 11,400 - would be enough to bring costs under control. There would be no need for further substantial restructuring, although intensifying competition meant there would be continual pressure on costs. Mercury, 80 per cent owned by the UK telecoms group Cable &amp; Wireless and 20 per cent by Bell Canada, has been the principal competitor to BT since the latter's privatisation in 1984. Competition in UK telecoms has intensified since the government opened up the market in 1991. Mr Lewis ascribed yesterday's moves to this, describing Mercury's network as 'mature' but not suited for competing across the board with a number of niche operators. Mercury's strategy will be to concentrate on niche services including international business, corporate and government business, small and medium enterprises and home business. It will continue to support residential customers but is likely to focus on cable television operators and other industry partners. Analysts remained sceptical that yesterday's retrenchment would end Mercury's problems. Mr Robert Morris, telecoms analyst with Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, said: 'This does not appear to address the key problem - that Mercury is becoming more of a niche operator by moving back into the corporate sector, yet that niche is under greater pressure than ever from new competitors and price cuts by BT.' Mr Laurence Heyworth, analyst at Robert Fleming, the broker, said: 'Mercury may face an even tougher challenge in future, as BT continues to improve its efficiency and marketing. If BT is given the greater pricing flexibility that it is seeking to target the market, it will have still more severe problems.' Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, will on Thursday publish a consultative document proposing far-reaching changes to UK competition rules.

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Pentos shares jump 15% despite drop to Pounds 2.4m PENTOS, the bookseller and print retailer, outperformed the stock market yesterday despite announcing a 17 per cent drop in pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30. Shares in the group, which owns the Dillons and Athena retailers, jumped 15 per cent to 75p, against a market rise of 3 per cent. Profits fell from Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 2.4m, partly as a result of a 32 per cent increase in interest charges to Pounds 2.5m. The return was struck on sales 16 per cent higher at Pounds 99.3m (Pounds 85.3m). Mr Patrick Hooper, finance director, said the group had achieved 'very good underlying sales' at Dillons. Like for like sales had risen by 3 per cent in a static market. Overall, Dillons increased turnover by 10 per cent to Pounds 49.2m. Mr Hooper said discounting, mostly employed around Christmas, had a minimal effect in the first half. He said Pentos was 'keeping its powder dry' with regard to an autumn discounting campaign involving books covered by the net book agreement. In the past it campaigned vigorously against the agreement, which sets minimum prices for most books. Ryman increased sales by 6 per cent to about Pounds 13.5m, excluding the office equipment group Wilding which was purchased for Pounds 3.7m in December. Overall office equipment turnover jumped 94 per cent to Pounds 24.8m. Athena, the retailer of prints and frame products, had been hard hit by the property slowdown and sales fell 2 per cent. The interim dividend is maintained at 0.7p, from earnings per share 24 per cent lower at 1.3p (1.7p).</p>

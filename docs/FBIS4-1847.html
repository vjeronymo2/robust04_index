			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 2 (AFP)--Australian Foreign Minister  Gareth Evans told Chinese Premier Li Peng Saturday of his  concern over the latest detention of leading dissident Wei  Jingsheng, but said his exchanges were not encouraging.    Evans told journalists after a meeting Saturday with Li that  he had raised the subject of Wei's detention, but added: "I  can't say that the result of that particular exchange was very  encouraging."    It was the second time in a month that Wei -- who was  attempting to return to Beijing from the nearby city of Tianjin  -- had been arrested.    Evans said he told Li "this added a whole new degree of  difficulty in resolving the MFN (most-favoured-nation) issue  with the United States and was a continuing matter of concern, a  new matter for a good deal of the rest of the international  community, including of course ourselves." [sentence as  received] The Australian foreign minister said Li did not seem  to be aware of the latest developments and responded with a  lecture on "the virtues of sticking to bilateral relations and  larger questions of international relations rather than internal  affairs."    "The premier's reaction was not forthcoming on the subject  of  Wei Jingsheng. It's not a subject that the Chinese Government  authorities care to talk about or care to talk about in polite  terms anyway," Evans said.    The reason for Wei's detention Friday and his present  whereabouts remain unclear. His secretary Tong Yi said she  hoped he would be released after about 24 hours as he was after  his previous detention one month ago.    The 43-year-old activist, who was released in September six  months short of a 15-year jail term for "counter-revolutionary"  activities, was among more than 15 dissidents picked up in a  police sweep in early March.</p>

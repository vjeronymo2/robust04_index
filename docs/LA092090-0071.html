			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUILDING BAN OKD FOR FOOTHILL BOULEVARD;  </P> <P> GROWTH: THE LA CANADA FLINTRIDGE COUNCIL HALTS CONSTRUCTION ON THE MAIN  COMMERCIAL CORRIDOR FOR 45 DAYS. THE ACTION COULD BE EXTENDED FOR A YEAR.  </P> <P> In an unusual show of unity, the La Canada Flintridge City Council on Monday  adopted a strict moratorium on construction along the community's main corridor  -- Foothill Boulevard.  </P> <P> The urgency ordinance, adopted unanimously, becomes effective immediately and  prohibits almost all new development for 45 days, blocking at least half a  dozen projects that were about to begin.  </P> <P> The moratorium could be extended for a year or more while the city develops a  long-range planning guide for the 3.5-mile commercial strip of Foothill between  Briggs Avenue and Oak Grove Drive, the entire length of the boulevard within  the city.  </P> <P> The action applies to all commercial and residential construction, except for  the Sport Chalet Shopping Village proposed for the intersection of Angeles  Crest Highway and Foothill. The council earlier gave approval to the village  project -- which will be the largest shopping center in the community -- after  six years of extensive studies and debate.  </P> <P> The moratorium will block all other construction, including several office and  retail developments that were about to get under way. The developers of those  projects, however, may appeal to the City Council for an exemption. The  moratorium does not affect projects that already have building permits.  </P> <P> The surprise moratorium was adopted just one week after members of the city's  Planning Commission warned council members at an informal breakfast of  community leaders that construction along the booming commercial district has  gotten out of hand.  </P> <P> Council members said they have heard growing complaints from residents about  the encroachment of high-density development in the affluent, suburban  community.  </P> <P> "We need to get back in control," said Councilwoman Joan C. Feehan, who called  for the moratorium. "We need to take time to take a step back and look and see  what's down there . . . to throw a net over everything," she said.  </P> <P> "I know we're not going to be popular with a certain segment of the population,  but I would rather be that than sitting back and doing nothing."  </P> <P> The city has no figures on the amount of new commercial construction in the  community, but officials said a change in the amount and type of development  has become apparent during the last year or so.  </P> <P> In recent years, gas stations, shops, service businesses and older residences  have been replaced by two-story commercial and office buildings, said Craig  Ewing, the city's community development director.  </P> <P> "When you replace a one-story building with a two-story building, it changes  the bulk and intensity of development. That looks different and changes the  perception of the community," he said.  </P> <P> Several officials have fretted that underground parking garages are out of  character with the community and that higher-density development is beginning  to cause traffic congestion, parking shortages and air pollution.  </P> <P> Council members often are divided on city issues, but the five members said  they thought the urgency moratorium was necessary to stop development while the  city develops a master plan. However, several said they may allow exceptions to  the building moratorium for projects that were about to be awarded building  permits.  </P> <P> State law requires the city to conduct a public hearing within 45 days before  the moratorium could be extended.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At its session in Mostar today, the executive of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Croatian Democratic Union [Hrvatska  Demokratska Zajednica -- HDZ] has been discussing the efforts  being made to resolve the state crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina  particularly in the light of the current negotiations between  the delegations of the Croatian and Muslim people. The HDZ has  issued a public statement including the following:    First, the political will of the Croat people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina has been repeatedly expressed through  legitimate and legal representatives, through the political  charter as well as the political declaration of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina HDZ and through the declaration of the House  of Representatives of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna.    Second, by sacrifice and by struggling hard for its survival  and the protection of all its rights, the Croat people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina has won an inalienable right to equality with  the other two peoples in the homeland of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Third, the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina is willing to  accept only such a form of Bosnia-Herzegovina's state  organization that will secure the sovereignty of the Croat  people in its territorial unit. This original sovereignty is  the foundation of all forms of power, including those powers  that are vested in bodies of the central authorities of the  future Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Fourth, the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina takes into  account the authentic features of individual areas in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and to this effect it is willing to work on  seeking more suitable solutions in keeping with these features  -- but only on the basis of the original sovereignty of the  Croat people and reciprocal protection for the rights of members  of all three state-building peoples.    Fifth, any solution to the state crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina  which were to disregard the sovereignty of the Croat people in  one part of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina would be at odds  with the hitherto expressed political will, historic rights and  interests of the Croat people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is  all the more so as the historical experiences of sovereignty  without a territorial definition were the main factor in the  oppression of the Croat people and a cause of its emigration and  demise. Sovereignty without territory has been scrapped in  multinational communities in modern state policies and legal  concepts and civilized countries.    Sixth, in seeking a just and lasting peace the Croat people  in Bosnia-Herzegovina has always taken into account, and always  will, the entirety of Croatian national interests.</p>

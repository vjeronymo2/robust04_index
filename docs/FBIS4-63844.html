			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris </F> Krivoshey and Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Excerpt] Moscow, 24 May -- Russian diplomacy is focusing  its efforts on resolving the task of bringing closer the  positions taken by Damascus and Tel Aviv in order to arrive at  practical accords between them as soon as possible, Grigoriy  Karasin, the head of the press and information department of the  Russian Foreign Ministry, said at a briefing today.    In his words, Moscow believes the Israeli-Palestinian  breakthrough does not a priori mean an irreversible turn in the  direction of a comprehensive and just peace in the region. It  is obvious that now is the time to resolutely move forward in  all areas of the Arab-Israeli talks, and particularly with  regard to Syria, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said.

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Lower interest helps Cropper edge ahead A fall in interest charges helped James Cropper, the paper and board manufacturer, to raise pre-tax profits by 5 per cent from Pounds 1.14m to Pounds 1.2m in the half year to October 1. Rapid price increases in pulp, the papermaking side's main raw material, had affected trading in this division after a good opening quarter. Mr James Cropper, chairman, warned that 'at present we do not see an end to the current shortage of pulp and its ever increasing cost'. These problems, together with disruption through moving the converting division, would make it difficult to improve on last year's record Pounds 2.56m profit, he said. Turnover rose 10 per cent to Pounds 23.6m. Earnings per share were again 9p and the interim dividend is held at 1.1p.</p>

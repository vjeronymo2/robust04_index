			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Major told of Scottish fears on decentralisation MR JOHN MAJOR said yester-day that he had been told of concerns over decentralisation in the public and private sectors during a meeting in Edinburgh with 14 prominent Scots. He added that the concerns about government and administration in Scotland had not extended to devolution. The three-hour meeting was part of the prime minister's general election pledge to 'take stock' of Scotland's constitutional position in the UK. He said the debate had put a different perspective on some constitutional questions. He declined to be drawn on what he described as 'rather surprising points' made during the meeting. He said the guests had been chosen for personal capabilities rather than public positions. 'I'm trying to gauge the instincts of people and what they believe needs to be done to enshrine and secure the distinctiveness of Scotland and its place within the union.' Opposition parties condemned the discussions as a sham, claiming that people advocating real political change had not been invited. Some of Mr Major's guests said the underlying presumption of the debate had been that the union between Scotland and England should be strengthened, and that a Scottish assembly - favoured by Labour and the Liberal Democrats - was not the way forward.</p>

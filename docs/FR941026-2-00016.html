			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> BPA develops and publishes a biennial integrated least cost plan,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Resource Program. In its Draft 1990 Resource Program, BPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> said it would be willing to participate in up to three geothermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pilot projects. The purpose of these projects would be to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initiate development, confirm resources, and determine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to develop three of the largest, most promising sites in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the region. BPA agreed to purchase_in joint ventures with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regional utilities_up to 10 average megawatts (aMW) from each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of three projects. After receiving comments from customers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supporting the projects, and after the Council approved this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach in its 1991 Power Plan, BPA published a solicitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that resulted in seven proposals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The objectives of BPA's solicitation were to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Meet contractual obligations to supply requested, cost-effective power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to BPA customers, having considered potential environmental impacts and mitigation measures in its decision;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Assure consistency with BPA's statutory responsibilities, including the Northwest Power Act, while taking into consideration the Council's Power Plan and Fish and Wildlife Program; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Test the availability of geothermal energy to provide a reliable,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economical, and environmentally acceptable alternative energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source to help meet the region's power needs. Three projects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were selected for contract negotiations on December 17, 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the selected projects was a proposal by the California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Energy Company (CEC) and the Eugene Water &amp; Electric Board (EWEB)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to develop a 30-aMW geothermal power plant and supporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities at Newberry Volcano, Oregon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This Administrative Record of Decision sets out the reasons for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BPA's decision to execute a Power Purchase Agreement with CE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Newberry, Inc. (a subsidiary of CEC), through which BPA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchase electrical output from the proposed Newberry Project; to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> execute a Billing Credits Generation Agreement with EWEB for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of the output from the Newberry Project; and to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wheeling services to EWEB for the transmission of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electricity to their system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Legal Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> BPA is a self-financing power marketing agency with the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States Department of Energy. BPA was established by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bonneville Project Act of 1937, 16 U.S.C. 832  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market wholesale power from the Bonneville Dam and to construct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> power lines for the transmission of this power to load centers in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Northwest. As other Federal dams and transmission lines were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> built, the combined power and transmission facilities have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integrated into a single power supply system. Today, BPA markets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> power from 30 Federal hydroelectric projects and two nuclear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plants. BPA's transmission systems contain 14,797 circuit miles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and provide about half of the region's power and three-fourths of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its transmission capacity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BPA sells wholesale electric power to 126 utilities, 13 direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service industrial customers (DSIs), and several government  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies. BPA's primary marketing area is the Pacific Northwest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> region, comprised of the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that portion of Montana lying west of the continental divide, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small portions of California, Utah, Wyoming, and Nevada.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16 U.S.C. 837 and 839a(14). BPA also has congressional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorization to sell or exchange wholesale power outside the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pacific Northwest to the extent that such power is surplus to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the needs of the region.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 16 U.S.C. 837a.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Northwest Power Act directs BPA to serve the net power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of any Pacific Northwest electric utility requesting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service, and to serve existing DSIs in the Pacific Northwest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16 U.S.C. 839c(b)(1) and (d). Although BPA cannot own or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construct electric generating facilities, the Northwest Power Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permits BPA to acquire rights to the output or capability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electric power resources.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 16 U.S.C. 839a(1) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16 U.S.C. 839d. BPA may acquire a major resource (a resource  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> having a planned capability greater than 50 aMW and acquired for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more than 5 years, 16 U.S.C. 839a(12)) if it is consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Council's Power Plan. 16 U.S.C. 839d(c)(1)(D). If the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resource is not major, the Northwest Power Act instructs that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resource must be consistent with the priorities required of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Plan. 16 U.S.C. 839d(b)(1) and (2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Northwest Power Act authorizes BPA to acquire experimental,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developmental, demonstration, or pilot projects of a type with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential for providing cost-effective service to the region.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16 U.S.C. 839d(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BPA is also directed by the Northwest Power Act to grant billing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credits to a customer, if requested. 16 U.S.C. 839d(h). A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> billing credit agreement is a contract between BPA and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> customer, under which BPA gives the customer a credit on its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> power bill for the difference between BPA's wholesale power rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the cost of power from a new resource. The energy and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity on which the credit is based is the net amount the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resource reduces the customer's load on BPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, BPA must satisfy all requirements of the National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). 42 U.S.C. 4321  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Description of Need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> BPA load forecasts for the 1990 Resource Program showed that if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the medium load growth rate occurs, BPA must acquire 500 aMW by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the year 2000 to meet customers' needs. Pacific Northwest Loads  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Resources Study, 1990. If utility and DSI loads grow at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medium-high rate, BPA will need to acquire an additional 1,500  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aMW by the year 2000. The analysis in BPA's Resource Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Impact Statement (RPEIS) showed that geothermal is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a reliable source of electric power that can help meet energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needs in the Pacific Northwest. Final Environmental Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Statement: Resource Programs, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> 1990 Resource Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> BPA's 1990 Resource Program, issued July 1990, defined the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions BPA would take to develop new resources to meet the power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of its customers. The 1990 Resource Program focused  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, and included near-term actions to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepare for these years. One of these actions was an offer to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate in geothermal pilot projects aimed at confirming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources and determining developability at three of the largest,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most promising sites in the Pacific Northwest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1990 Resource Program was developed through an extensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public process that included a technical review panel. Many of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the comments received supported BPA's participation in geothermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pilot projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Council Plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Council's 1991 Power Plan noted that the geothermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confirmation program in BPA's 1990 Resource Program was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the recommendations of the Council's Research,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Development, and Demonstration Advisory Committee. The Council's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Recommended Activities for Implementing the 1991 Power Plan''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included geothermal demonstration projects initiated by BPA and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the region's utilities. The Council acknowledged that energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs of a demonstration plant would likely be higher than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marginal cost of other new resources, but the premium would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decline over time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Pilot Project Solicitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Request for Proposals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> BPA published a Request for Proposals (RFP) in Commerce Business  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Daily on July 5, 1991. The RFP stated that BPA would be willing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to purchase up to 10 aMW of electric power from each of three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects located in or near the BPA service area. Other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions specified in the RFP were:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;BPA would not finance projects but only purchase output  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Part of the output from each project had to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchased by another utility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Overall project size could be greater than 10 aMW  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The proposed site had to be capable of supporting at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least 100 MW  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The proposed site had to be suitable for operation as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal geothermal unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The resource area had to be undeveloped for electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> power production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The power contract had to include an option for BPA to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchase subsequent output from the site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Projects that would allow BPA to be a cooperating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency in a BLM environmental process were strongly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preferred  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These conditions were intended in part to limit the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposals likely to be submitted. BPA could devote only a small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of staff time to evaluating proposals, and therefore tried  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be quite specific about what it wanted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Project sponsors were encouraged to submit project outlines or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summaries ahead of time before developing detailed proposals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This was intended to prevent developers from spending money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developing proposals that would not meet program goals. Several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developers met with program staff or discussed the RFP on an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informal basis before submitting proposals. Letters of intent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were due September 3, 1991, and proposals were due October 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

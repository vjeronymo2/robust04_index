			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Letter to LA REPUBBLICA editor from National Rebirth Pact </F> leader Mario Segni: "`I Want an Election with Cards on the  Table'"]    [Text] Dear Mr. Scalfari,    I am very pleased to reply to your questions. The statements  I have made recently are not the result of any extemporizing or  turnabouts, but the continuation of proposals or initiatives  pursued consistently over the past months. It would be very  helpful to be able to explain this once again.    Let us begin with my request for a clarification from Mr.  Ciampi. Immediately after the approval of the electoral law, I  maintained that the institutional reform was still very much  incomplete, because we needed a system that would grant citizens  the opportunity to choose not only a majority but also the  individuals that are to lead the government, similarly to what  happens in the case of mayors. This is why I proposed the  direct election of the prime minister, and I still maintain that  this -- or another reform that will in any case grant voters the  power to choose the individuals who will lead the government --  should be one of the most important things to be achieved in the  next legislative term.    The situation has not permitted the approval of such a  reform. Therefore, many people have put forward the idea that  the reform should be implemented politically right now, that is,  that it would be useful and desirable for each alignment to  specify not only its program but also the individual that it  will put forward as candidate to the premiership. I agree with  this idea, which I consider consistent with the thinking behind  the referendums. I believe it would contribute considerable  clarity and innovation to the coming election campaign.    I believe it is well liked by the citizens, who welcomed the  major innovation of the direct election of mayors. This is why  I agreed to be put forward as the candidate for prime minister  by the liberal-democratic and reformist alignment that is  forming around the Pact. Everyone may form whatever opinion  they like of this. I consider it an act of openness. I want  those who vote for the Pact to know not only what we will do but  also who will govern them. I want -- at last, after an  ambiguous system that has lasted for a long time -- the next  elections to be conducted with cards on the table.    It was precisely because we made this decision that we are  entitled to demand that the others place their cards on the  table, too. This is why from the very first day I demanded that  the other groupings name their own candidates. Of course there  is no legal obligation. But I am sure that there is an  obligation from the viewpoint of clarity. If any alliance is  unable to do this, it should state so openly, admit its  inability to do so, or its decision not to put forward its own  candidate. This is legitimate. But it is also legitimate that  the voters be informed of this and be able to form their own  judgment.    Occhetto's left-wing coalition seems to have a problem in  this regard. It knows that any decision would cause splits or  encounter unpopularity. This is why it cunningly cites several  names, often including Mr. Ciampi's. In this way it is trying  to benefit from the prestige enjoyed by the prime minister,  without paying the price that this option would entail.    This conduct on Mr. Occhetto's part must be openly  condemned,  and we will do so consistently. But precisely because what is  at issue is the clarity of the elections at such a delicate  time, it is necessary to demand that Mr. Ciampi too contribute  to this clarity. Mr. Ciampi cannot be unaware that it is not  enough to state that he is not standing as a candidate for the  lower house or the Senate, in order to rule out his standing as  someone's candidate to the premiership. He cannot be unaware  that again yesterday, after his remarks, [Democratic Alliance  members] Barbera and Ayala cited him as the progressive front's  candidate. He cannot be unaware that, if an election were to  take place in such a situation, many Italians would believe that  he is the left's candidate, or one of its candidates, to the  premiership. Of course, if such an option were to be taken  openly, we would combat it politically, but it would be  perfectly legitimate. What is necessary it that matters be  clear. And it is precisely because of the esteem in which I hold  Mr. Ciampi that I urge him not to permit such a misunderstanding  to exist.    Let us move on to the second part, that is, to my opposition  to the tax decree. Allow me to go back over what I have been  saying for some months. Back in October, at the People's Reform  group conference in Naples, we raised the issue of taxation as  the crucial problem in Italy's life, and stressed three things:  that fiscal pressure had reached a level that was intolerable  to the public and dangerous to the production system (your  newspaper reported yesterday that it has reached 43.7 percent,  the highest level in Europe); that the tax authorities'  inefficiency posed serious problems of equitability; and that  the complexity of the tax system has created a dangerous  attitude of rebellion among the citizens.    The proposals explained by Augusto Fantozzi were anything  but demagogic. We did not (and do not) in any way propose an  immediate reduction of the tax burden, in the knowledge that  this is something that a country with a public debt like ours  cannot afford. We proposed instead a curb on tax pressure, with  an immediate commitment to fight the financial reform battle on  the expenditure front. We also proposed a number of measures  which, by rapidly enhancing the efficiency of the financial  administration, would permit a reduction of tax evasion and  therefore a reduction of tax levels.    Only within such an outlook, and with incisive action to cut  public spending, did we put forward the proposal -- drawn up by  Baldassarri and taken up again yesterday by Tremonti -- of a  constitutional limit on tax revenue. We did not wait for  Berlusconi to introduce these ideas. But I do not see what is  demagogic about focusing the political debate on an issue such  as taxation, which is now crucial to our nation's life, and  about putting forward not the destructive proposals of tax  revolt but ideas that could make it possible not only to balance  our accounts again but also to establish new relations of trust  between state and citizens. And it is certainly no South  American-style method, which is the charge that Occhetto has  leveled at me: If anything, that charge would apply to a lax  spending policy.    These objectives are held partly by the government, too,  which promises for next year a 1.7-percent reduction in tax  pressure (which shows how undemagogic our ideas are). But the  deeds seem to us to conflict with the stated aims. This,  because the objective of reducing taxes seems to lack  credibility at a time when taxes are being increased and at a  time when there seems to be a prospect (not envisaged by the  Finance Bill but not denied by the government) of the need for  another and more substantial tax package immediately after the  elections, thus providing grounds for the anxieties that the  promised 28 trillion lire worth of cuts will be partly  nullified. This, especially since on the public employment  front a number of measures -- such as the doubling of  administrative staff at local health centers and the transfer to  various ministries of management personnel from the dissolved  Agensud [Agency for financing projects in the South] at much  higher pay levels than other categories -- operate in the  opposite direction.    Of course the battle to cut spending is a complex one, much  more difficult than the gradual increase of the tax burden that  has been pursued hitherto. I will confine myself for the  present to recalling what I said the other day when I criticized  the tax decree -- that is, that to aim to cut the planned  inflation rate to 2.5 percent in 1994 and to base the  negotiation of public employment contracts on that is a means of  achieving a reduction of the deficit without raising tax  pressure. If the government keeps the planed inflation rate  higher, it risks failure.    One final reply to your postscript. It should be  unnecessary, because in recent days I have constantly repeated  that my only concern is to build the Pact. You ask me about any  accords with Fini. I have always ruled them out, whether before  or after the elections. I fear that Occhetto is about to give  the opposite reply with regard to Communist Renaissance. I  hope, however (and I hope also that I am not among the poor  innocents to whom you refer) that our friends in the Democratic  Alliance will stand firm by their commitment not to ally with  Communist Renaissance.</p>

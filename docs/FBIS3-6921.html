And, on March 22, he issued even  a belligerent "order" to the puppet Army units to be "on the  alert".    Accordingly, the puppet Joint Chiefs of Staff proclaimed "an  order of special alert" covering the period from March 23 to 30,  putting the puppet ground, Navy and Air Forces on "a war  footing".    Thus, the South Korean trigger-happy elements are madly  pushing the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of  war.    As is known to all, the Kim Yong-sam group, after  unilaterally breaking up the working-level contact for the  exchange of presidential envoys between the North and the South,  openly declared that it would resume the "Team Spirit" joint  military exercises with the United States, its master, and is  driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to an extreme  pitch of strain by introducing even Patriot missiles into South  Korea of the United States.    The "order" of an "alert posture" which was issued on the  extension line of such unpardonable dangerous military  provocations against the North well shows to what extremes the  traitor Kim Yong-sam has gone in his belligerent attempt to  overpower the North by force of arms at any cost with the help  of outside forces.    The North is prepared for both dialogue and war. This is its  unshakable stand and will.    If the South Korean puppet clique venture a reckless war  gamble, remaining deaf to the DPRK's repeated warnings, the  North would take a decisive self-defensive measure against it.</p>

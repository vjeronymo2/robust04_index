			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Algeria loses some credibility with departure of key minister THE resignation of Algeria's foreign minister, Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, is a considerable blow to the international reputation of the government of Prime Minister Belad Abdessalam. Mr Brahimi is one of the Arab world's most respected diplomats. In 1989 he brokered the Taif agreement that brought a measure of peace to Lebanon. His departure late on Wednesday underlines the prime minister's desire for unchallenged authority and his unwillingness to allow even a long-standing political friend any great authority over his own department. The daily Algerian newspaper El Watan said yesterday that the cabinet reshuffle which followed Mr Brahimi's resignation suggests Mr Abdessalam has no intention of negotiating with other political forces. Three weeks ago, the acting head of state, Mr Ali Kafi, said his five-man interim presidency - which took over from President Chadli Bendjedid 13 months ago - would seek the people's endorsement for a transitional arrangement before a final agreement on a new constitution. The embattled prime minister faces two challenges. A year after declaring war on Islamic fundamentalists groups, the security forces are still mired in bloody clashes with the radicals. The second challenge is economic. The budget deficit is set to double this year to dinars 168.3bn (Pounds 5.2bn), equivalent to some 40 per cent of budget receipts, a figure which will make it more difficult to seal an agreement with the International Monetary Fund. Spending on defence and security is set to increase by 50 per cent, while dinars 83.5bn will be allocated to the recapitalisation of loss-making state companies.</p>

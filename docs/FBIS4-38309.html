			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Mahir Chmaytilli] </F>   [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 30 (AFP) -- Southern Yemeni forces  have been hampered by internal dissension and a lack of manpower  as they struggle to thwart a northern advance along about 100  kilometres (60 miles) of frontline around the port city of Aden.    Three northern tanks slipped through into the undefended  western suburb of Madinat al-Sha'b on Saturday [25 June], the  office of the south's appointed vice-president 'Abd-al-Rahman  al-Jifri said.    Initially they met no resistance, giving northern forces  enough time to consolidate their forces and cut off Aden from  its oil refinery 18 kilometres (11 miles) to the west along the  coast road.    Southern forces swiftly hurled their men towards the area in  a bid to recapture the route to the refinery which supplies  their troops with fuel.    But the north had the advantage of surprise and, turning the  tables, launched another offensive to the north.    By Tuesday they had advanced as far as the city's pumping  station about 15 kilometres (nine miles) north of the city.    Aden was thus effectively cut off from vital fuel and water  supplies.    Southern officers collectively attribute the northern push  to  a lack of manpower among the soldiers loyal to southern leader  'Ali Salim al-Bid.    They point out that the south, which declared independence  on  May 21, has just three million people, compared with the north's  population of 11 million.    In a bid to make up the numbers, a general call-up has been  announced and buses tour the city collecting young men to take  them to the front.    Since the war broke out on May 5 the south has been further  handicapped by dissension among its own ranks.    A member of the southern presidential council, Sulayman  Nasir  Mas'ud, has accused soldiers loyal to the former president of  South Yemen 'Ali Nasir Muhammad of backing the north in Abyan  province east of Aden.    Muhammad, who came from Abyan, was toppled by al-Bid in a  bloody power struggle in Aden in 1986, before the former  conservative North Yemen merged with the Marxist South in May  1990.    Al-Jifri accused units loyal to the former president  deployed  in the north of "treason," saying they had lent their weight to  al- Bid's rival, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, a northerner.    The units knew the layout of the terrain in the south.    The south's setbacks can also be explained by the loss of  three of their best units. They were attacked and knocked out  of action even before the war broke out.    The south had tried to withdraw the units, deployed in the  northern areas of Dhamar, 'Amran and Yarim, but the move had  been fiercely opposed by Salih.    Southern leaders are also trying to combat Moslem  fundamentalists allied to Salih.    About 3,000 of them are said to be hiding out in and around  Aden, according to informed sources.    Southern officers have already blamed them for the fall of  several key points, including the town of Lahij, about 30  kilometres (18 miles) north of Aden, seized by the north three  weeks ago.    Roadblocks crisscross Aden, barring the entrance to every  district as searches go on for the Islamic militants.    Women militia are among 30,000 members of the Yemen  Socialist  Party (YSP) deployed in the city to stop any insurrection. The  women's job is to search women wearing the Moslem veil.    Northern Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah has said the  north's troops "are inside Aden itself," and Sanaa is counting  on the population to rise up and seize the city.</p>

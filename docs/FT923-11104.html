			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Whither the dollar? Despite the concerted central bank intervention to keep the dollar above its all-time low, investors remain uncertain about what the US currency will do next, writes James Blitz. The upside for the dollar could be strong. The currency was boosted at the end of last week by figures for durable goods sales, which rose 2.3 per cent in June after a revised fall of 2.2 per cent in May. The central bank intervention also made clear that the Federal Reserve is unwilling to see the currency dip below the all-time low against the D-Mark of DM1.4430. The dollar should get additional strength from this week's German cost of living figure, which is likely to show a fall in annualised inflation by 1 per cent to about 3.3 per cent. That could underline the case of those in the Bundesbank who do not want to see another Lombard rate rise. The reasons to be bearish about dollar/D-Mark remain strong, however. They are the huge differential in German and US short term interest rates and the overshooting of the Bundesbank's M3 money supply target. The preliminary estimate for second quarter growth in the US, due out on Thursday, will give some indication of whether the Federal Reserve is still justified to forecast US economic growth next year at 2 1/2 per cent. The conference board's consumer confidence index, due tomorrow, will also be watched by the markets. But with few important indicators due in either the US or the UK in the next two weeks, the exact outlook for the dollar and sterling is uncertain. As one London dealer says: 'I have very little by way of positions and little certainty of where things are moving. We could be in for one of those lazy summer seasons.'</p>

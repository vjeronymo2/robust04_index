			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTONOVICH'S VIEW ON THE NEA CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> Regarding Allan Parachini's "For New NEA Chief: A Brush With Disaster," Nov.  22: After only a short time on the job, John Frohnmayer, chairman of the  National Endowment for the Arts, went native all the way. The arts crowd, or  that part of it that wants taxpayers' money to pay for obscenity and attacks on  religion and patriotism, framed a case to bait him into withholding money from  an exhibit; then they cracked down, and he reversed himself.  </P> <P> Now, it is suggested, the arts crowd is willing to let up on him and let him  keep his job. And no wonder; he has been caponized, and the operation is  irreversible.  </P> <P> RICHARD A. PERKINS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

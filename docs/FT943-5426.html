			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / On holiday with my brain cells: Christian Tyler explains why getting away from it all is harder than you think The first apparition materialised at a cafe opposite San Sepolcro cathedral. My wife scribbled a note and held it up to my nose. 'DO NOT STARE,' it said. 'The man at the next table is John Cleese.' I turned and stared. 'It can't be,' I hissed. 'What's he doing here?' She hissed back: 'What are we doing here?' The second shade was standing disconsolately in a scrum of Italian housewives at the delicatessen counter of the Co-op. It looked strangely like Professor Bill Wedderburn, the eminent labour lawyer and Marxist peer. I stepped forward: 'Well, if it isn't . . .' It was. So we retired to the bar with our trolleys for a beer. When the third manifestation occurred a few days later I began to wonder what agency was sending them, and why. This phantasm was tucking into a tutti frutti ice-cream opposite the Minerva temple in Assisi. I nudged my brother-in-law. 'Is that who I think it is?' 'Madre di Dio]' he exclaimed (or something like it). 'It's Kenneth Clarke.' We decided on balance, being sensitive souls, to leave him in peace with his pudding. We like to say that we shun other tourists, especially our own compatriots. Yet I was surprised to feel a pang of solidarity with these fellow escapees from the little off-shore island on the rim of the Eurasian landmass. There seemed to be a message in the coincidences. But what were the wraith-messengers trying to tell me? Surely it was something more profound than that middle-aged swingers take their holidays east of Arezzo? And why were they so difficult to recognise? Back at home again, the answer seems obvious: We were all in the wrong place. In other words, you may pack your possessions and your children, put the cat in a boarding house, lock the front door and drive 1,000 miles. But you cannot take your brain cells on holiday. Transport your body, soul and senses where you please; your cerebral cortex remains helplessly wired into its own version of reality. For the first week the brain refuses to leave home at all; it must be distracted with the minor tasks involved in living in a foreign place. In the second week it begins to surrender and take an interest in its new surroundings. But by the beginning of the third (if you are wise enough to take three weeks) it is already making ready to return. Our desire for total dislocation was not entirely vain. Spread-eagled by the heat on an Umbrian hillside, lost to view round the last hairpin bend, it was easy to cultivate the illusion of escape. But the substitute reality of rural middle Italy remained as elusive as the tree frogs whose telephonic trilling filled the nights. The body was a willing slave to lassitude, the spirit succumbed. And then the brain piped up: 'When do the banks shut? Is there enough milk for the morning? Hell] It's half-day closing. And the well is running dry . . . Dear God, will it never rain?' There are stratagems for this condition. One can play at living the peasant life - up at dawn, walk round the fields of sunflowers browning in the sun, inspect the tobacco plants being expensively watered from the reservoir, scramble indoors out of the sun to read, eat and doze until it is time to open the first bottle of the night. But the townie's rustic roots are too deeply buried and his agricultural memory has atrophied. A former ambassador to Tokyo once told me that when a foreigner says to you he understands the Japanese it means he has become Japan-ese. That voluntarily displaced person, the holidaymaker, can live like a peasant only by becoming a peasant, which - if he has any sense - is the thing furthest from his mind. So while his eye is delighting in the scene from his vine-clad terrace his cortex is probably calculating how much European Union subsidy he has personally contributed to create such charming effects. Macbeth was wrong: returning is not more tedious than going o'er, even if the first encounter with native British reality can be a shock. My heart sank to my deckshoes at the sight of the newspaper headline on the Channel ferry: 'Princess Di in phone leak probe'. Was nothing else happening in my real world? Lord Archer was still in trouble over his share dealings. The replacement royal yacht Britannia was to be hawked around to corporate sponsors and former Page Three girl Samantha Fox had discovered Jesus. The only piece of genuine news was simply incredible - that the IRA was about to declare a ceasefire in Northern Ireland. 'Good holiday?' they ask you kindly as you mooch into the office. Yes, thanks. Great. (And it was). 'Glad to be back, ha, ha,' they always add. The proper answer is to roll the eyes heavenward and twist the face into a grimace of simulated pain. It is a foolish convention. It connives at the strange superstition that we must never admit, because of the huge investment we have made in going away, that coming home is a real pleasure.</p>

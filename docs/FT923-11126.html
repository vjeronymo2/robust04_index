			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Letter: Sterling revaluation suggested by Bank's choice of funding Sir, On July 21 the Bank of England raised Ecu50m in three-year Treasury notes at a yield of 10.04 per cent. At close of business on that day the benchmark three-year gilt (Exchequer 10 1/4 per cent July 21 1995) was yielding 9.64 per cent on an annual basis. Might I ask why the UK monetary authorities see fit to fund in a foreign currency, at an extra cost to the taxpayer of 0.4 per cent per annum, at a time of great concern about the public sector deficit? Perhaps the Bank of England is planning an upwards revaluation of sterling, which is the only scenario under which this funding method makes sense?

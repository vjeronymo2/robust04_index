			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Tightening of controls on Japanese non-banks delayed THE PROTRACTED parliamentary debate over Japanese peace-keeping personnel has delayed the passage of amendments tightening the Ministry of Finance's control over Japan's non-banking financial sector. Non-banks, meaning consumer credit, leasing and housing finance companies, have become the Japanese financial establishment's favourite scapegoat for the rampant lending for stock and land speculation in the late 1980s. In wanting to be seen to be tackling speculation, the Finance Ministry, with broad support from Japanese politicians, has proposed revisions of the Loan Business Law that will force the non-bank institutions to provide more information about their business activities. By pushing for the changes, the ministry is extending its authority over a sector which has been the responsibility of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti), as non-banks such as leasing companies are in Japan more closely identified with industry. Miti does not oppose these amendments, which may be presented to parliament today, depending on the fate of the peacekeeping debate, but it is concerned that increasingly tough controls will strangle the companies' important industrial role. The non-banks are concerned by the vague wording of the proposed amendments. For example, it is proposed that the Finance Ministry exercise greater authority over the institutions' loans related to 'stocks, etcetera'. 'We are very worried about that etcetera,' said Nippon Shinpan, the country's largest consumer credit company. 'A lot depends on how they interpret etcetera. We are watching very closely.' Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, argues that non-bank lending has grown 'quite quickly' over the past few years, and 'we need rules to ensure their credibility'. From last March, the ministry was empowered to gather information on non-banks' property loan exposure, and the planned revisions will allow it to demand details about other types of loans and about large customers. Part of the concern of companies such as Nippon Shinpan is that the ministry will continue to crack down on so-called 'non-banks', while taking a softer line on the bank non-banks, the affiliates of commercial banks which were particularly active speculative lenders during the late 1980s. Leading Japanese banks have links to hundreds of these non-banks, and the Finance Ministry is keen to play down their problem loans as it was responsible for their behaviour and because it wants to ease fears about the health of the banking system. The non-banks independent of banks fear that the ministry is using parliamentary concern about collapsing stock and land prices to fulfil a long-held ambition to restrict their activities. However, the ministry insists a tightening of control is a necessary result of the non-banks' larger lending role.</p>

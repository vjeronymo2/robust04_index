			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Debts cloud mayor's vision of Nmes reborn: Alice Rawsthorn on a southern town's revival efforts MR Jean Bousquet this month celebrated one of the highlights of his decade as mayor of the city of Nmes in southern France with the inauguration of the Carre d'Art, a spectacular new modern art museum and mediatheque designed by Sir Norman Foster, the British architect. The Carre d'Art was conceived as a counterpart to the nearby third-century Roman temple, Maison Carree. It has cost FFr383m (Dollars 70.7m) and is by far the most grandiose of all the buildings commissioned by Mr Bousquet since he launched his ambitious architectural programme 10 years ago. But instead of marking the summit of Mr Bousquet's achievements, the opening of the Carre d'Art has been clouded by concern about the cost of Nmes' new buildings in these difficult economic times. Nmes was in decline when Mr Bousquet, the conservative chairman of the Cacharel clothing company, became mayor in 1983. It was a sleepy southern tourist town. Young people were drifting away, leaving an ageing population behind them. The new mayor was particularly frustrated by the contrast between Nmes and neighbouring Montpellier. The two cities were the same size in the early 1960s. But Nmes had since shrunk, while Montpellier was thriving thanks partly to the dynamic arts and economic policies of Mr Georges Freche, its Socialist mayor and one of Mr Bousquet's local rivals. Mr Bousquet started his own regeneration strategy. While President Francois Mitterrand was flinging up the Grands Projets, his pharaonic architectural schemes in Paris, Mr Bousquet initiated his own Petits Projets in Nmes. The level of investment rose from FFr88m in 1982, the year before Mr Bousquet became mayor, to a 1988 peak of FFr403m. Nmes has emerged with an impressive collection of contemporary buildings, including the Carre d'Art, the Nemausus housing project by Mr Jean Nouvel of France, and a sports stadium by Italy's Mr Vittorio Gregotti. Mr Bousquet has also drafted in famous French designers including Ms Andree Puttnam, who overhauled the city's park benches, and Mr Philippe Starck, who created a civic logo. Mr Bousquet has undoubtedly succeeded in modernising Nmes' image. The Georges Pompidou Centre in Paris even staged an exhibition dedicated to his architectural policy. But his new buildings were intended to attract more than critical praise. They were also supposed to encourage an economic revival. There are some positive signs. The exodus from Nmes has stopped. The population has grown by about 4,000 to 133,607 since 1983 and 2,000 jobs have been created. But the city has also been left with heavy debts, and the level of unemployment, at 17 per cent, is still well above the national average of about 10 per cent. Mr Bousquet now faces the challenge of reducing the debt and tackling unemployment. He has stopped spending so much money, with investment falling to FFr283m last year from its 1988 peak. The level of debt per inhabitant has fallen from FFr3,802 in 1989 to FFr2,335 in 1992. But Mr Bousquet's hopes of reducing it further by selling land to private developers  - as Mr Freche did in Montpellier during the buoyant 1980s  - could be impeded by the sluggishness of the property market. The recession could also hinder his hopes of capitalising on the publicity generated by Nmes' new buildings to attract investment. At present local attention is distracted from these issues by the furore over the dismissal of Mr Simon Casas, high-profile director of the Arenes. Mr Casas, a former matador who relaunched the Arenes (arena) by bringing in a string of celebrity bullfighters, unsuccessfully challenged one of Mr Bousquet's allies for a conservative candidacy in this spring's parliamentary elections. Three days after the elections he was fired, triggering a blistering row with Mr Bousquet. Once the row has died down, and the excitement of the Carre d'Art opening evaporates, Mr Bousquet and the Nmois will have no more distractions from the mundane matters of paying off debts and creating jobs in a chilly economic climate. Another Petit Projet is in the pipeline: a university for 4,000 students on the site of the 17th century Fort Vauban. Mr Bousquet has also begun an ambitious urban plan to redefine the city's boundaries, extend its green spaces and link the ancient aspects of its architecture by new roads including an 8km Grand Axe designed by Sir Norman Foster.</p>

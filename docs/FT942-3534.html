			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Allianz takes 30% of Berner Holding Allianz of Germany, Europe's largest insurance company, yesterday announced the acquisition of a 30 per cent stake in Switzerland's Berner Holding, in a rare example of foreign penetration into the highly-regulated Swiss insurance market. The deal is one of a number of recent cross-border acquisitions by European insurance companies, which are expecting an increase in competition as the European insurance market is liberalised. Allianz, which made the acquisition through its Italian subsidiary, Riunione Adriatica di Sicurta, did not disclose details of the price. In recent transactions European insurers have been sold for amounts equal to between 50 and 100 per cent of their annual premium income. In 1993 the consolidated net premium income of Berner Group, one of Switzerland's leading 10 insurers, amounted to SFr1.08bn (Dollars 771m). The group had a 4.7 per cent share of the Swiss non-life market in 1992. Allianz has extended its operations outside Germany in the past 10 years. It acquired Cornhill of the UK in 1984, and has subsidiaries in most European markets. In Switzerland it owns two small companies, Allianz Continentale Allgemeine and Allianz Continentale Lebensversicherungs. The companies' premium income amounted to SFr268.5m in 1993. Allianz said the co-operation with Berner, formed from three smaller companies in 1990, offered 'interesting perspectives' for both parties. Although Berner would continue to work as an independently run enterprise, the deal would strengthen its capital base and increase underwriting capacity. Last week Commercial Union, the UK's largest company, announced that it was poised to pay Pounds 1.46bn (Dollars 2.2bn) to buy the Abeille Assurances and Abeille Vie operations of Groupe Victoire, France's sixth largest life insurer.</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: HSBC/Midland Lloyds' withdrawal left the outcome of HSBC's bid for Midland, which closes on Thursday, pretty much a foregone conclusion. Indeed Lloyds may ultimately have helped HSBC's cause by showing that there was no real alternative. It is hard to see a majority of investors turning their backs now, especially as that would bring a sharp fall in Midland's price. Just the same, it looks as though the 'yes' vote will lack conviction. Indeed, one reason for the difference between yesterday's Midland close of 423p and the bid's value of 441p may be selling in the market for cash. The deal will bring short-term benefits to Midland holders in the form of a dividend restored to a level they could otherwise only expect much later in the UK bank's recovery. In theory they will also share in south China's growth prospects. Yet HSBC itself has underperformed the Hang Seng index by 14 per cent since the bid was revealed, partly due to the disclosure of its Dollars 780m exposure to Olympia &amp; York. The merger may bring some synergy benefits in areas such as foreign exchange, but Midland holders will face exposure to Chinese politics, as Cable &amp; Wireless holders found after the Tiananmen Square massacre. More immediate worries are the impact on Hong Kong of deadlock in the Uruguay Round and of Japan's economic slowdown. Some of this may be forgotten in the initial euphoria as HSBC joins the Footsie. A place in the index does not normally confer lasting outperformance, however. That could provide a further opportunity for those investors who remain suspicious of the merger concept to sell into strength.</p>

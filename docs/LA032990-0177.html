			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1989 ALL-STARS;  </P> <P> LYNWOOD'S HIGH-SCORING KILLUM LEADS SOUTHEAST PREP BOYS ALL-STAR TEAM  </P> <P> Unstoppable is perhaps the best way to describe Lynwood High School's Earnest  Killum, the top scorer on the 1990 Times All-Southeast prep basketball team.  </P> <P> Combining his ability to shoot from outside, drive to the basket and leap, the  6-foot-4 1/2 Killum averaged 30 points and 7.5 rebounds a game.  </P> <P> He played in 60 varsity games in two years under Coach Bill Notley and was  never held under 10 points.  </P> <P> Heavily recruited by colleges and universities, he is considering Oklahoma,  Oregon State, Nevada-Las Vegas and Cal State Long Beach.  </P> <P> It is the second consecutive year that Killum has made The Times' all-star  team.  </P> <P> Here is a look at the rest of the All-Southeast team, which includes three  juniors and a sophomore:  </P> <P> Juaquin Hawkins, Lynwood -- A 6-5 junior, Hawkins averaged 11 points and 9.5  rebounds. "He has shown flashes of brilliance," Lynwood Coach Notley said.  "Once he becomes consistent, he will be an outstanding player."  </P> <P> Scott Day, Cerritos -- Day, a 6-foot senior, averaged 18 points and 5 assists,  and shot 46% from three-point range. He had a high game of 34 points and was  All-San Gabriel Valley League. "We relied on him for leadership and ball  handling," Cerritos Coach Jim Chapel said.  </P> <P> Mark Flick, Cerritos -- A good rebounder who can handle the ball, the 6-7  Flick, a junior, averaged 15 points and 7.5 rebounds. Like Day, he was  all-league. "He will lead the team next year," Chapel said.  </P> <P> Brandon Titus, Gahr -- A 6-3 sophomore, Titus is a "legitimate gym rat,"  according to Gahr Coach Vern Stewart. "He will be very good because he loves  the game so much," Stewart said. Titus averaged 17.6 points, 4.8 rebounds and 4  assists. Confidence is one of his best assets.  </P> <P> Paul White, California -- A three-year varsity player, the 6-8 White averaged  21 points, 16.5 rebounds and 7 blocked shots. "He has leadership on and off the  court," California Coach Paul Turley said. "He dominated from every  standpoint."  </P> <P> Ruben Oronoz, Whittier Christian -- "He allowed us to limit teams to one shot  because he dominated the defensive boards," Whittier Christian Coach Bob Brown  said of the 6-5 junior, who averaged 17 points and 10 rebounds. Oronoz can  score from inside or outside.  </P> <P> Sam Sybesma, Valley Christian -- This quick, 6-2 senior guard had averages of  17 points, 3 assists and 3 steals. "His composure made him a great player,"  Crusaders Coach Harold DeBie said.  </P> <P> Chris Beck, Brethren -- The hard-working Beck led the Warriors into the  playoffs. A 6-2 senior, he averaged 10 points, 5.6 rebounds and 6 assists.  </P> <P> Jason Pietsch, La Mirada -- The 6-8 senior was the Matadores' best all-around  player, averaging 15.4 points and 7 rebounds. He played outside early in the  season, then switched inside when the Suburban League started. He has a 3.75  grade-point average.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Southeast all-star boys and girls teams, each consisting of 10 members,  their coaches and parents, will be guests of The Times at 9 a.m. Sunday at the  Anaheim Hilton for the annual Times High School Basketball Awards Brunch.  All-star teams from 12 circulation areas will be honored and the players and  coaches of the year from each area will be announced.  </P> <P> The teams were chosen on the basis of a poll of area coaches, who were asked to  fill out ballots nominating their own players and opponents, plus the  observations of college scouts and sportswriters. Each player will receive the  traditional Times golden basketball plaque and award certificate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Boys Prep Team  </P> <P> Name: Earnest Killum  </P> <P> School: Lynwood  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-4 1/2  </P> <P> Average: 30.0  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Juaquin Hawkins  </P> <P> School: Lynwood  </P> <P> Year: Junior  </P> <P> Height: 6-5  </P> <P> Average: 11.0  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Scott Day  </P> <P> School: Cerritos  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-0  </P> <P> Average: 18.3  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Mark Flick  </P> <P> School: Cerritos  </P> <P> Year: Junior  </P> <P> Height: 6-7  </P> <P> Average: 15.3  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Brandon Titus  </P> <P> School: Gahr  </P> <P> Year: Sophomore  </P> <P> Height: 6-3  </P> <P> Average: 17.6  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Paul White  </P> <P> School: California  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-8  </P> <P> Average: 21.0  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Ruben Oronoz  </P> <P> School: Whittier Christian  </P> <P> Year: Junior  </P> <P> Height: 6-5  </P> <P> Average: 17.0  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Sam Sybesma  </P> <P> School: Valley Christian  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-2  </P> <P> Average: 17.7  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Chris Beck  </P> <P> School: Brethren  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-2  </P> <P> Average: 10.1  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Jason Pietsch  </P> <P> School: La Mirada  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-8  </P> <P> Average: 15.4  </P></p>

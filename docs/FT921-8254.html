			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Money Markets: UK rates firm THE BANK of England set out to skim the froth of interest rate speculation yesterday, signalling in its early dealings that there would be no imminent cut. It traded just a shade under the current 10 1/2 per cent base rate level during the day. However, the market was still gambling on a reduction around the March 10 UK Budget, with players holding on to their paper for more favourable rates. As a result, the Bank of England injected a mere Pounds 431m by midday to stem a forecast Pounds 1.3bn shortage. Treasury bills, maturing assistance and exchequer transactions accounted for the lion's share of the shortfall. In the morning, the Bank bought band one and two bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent, and Pounds 316m in paper for resale to the market on March 9 at 10 7/16 per cent. The afternoon found players still scrambling for paper, as the Bank again operated in measured tranches of band one and two bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. Afternoon and late help totalled Pounds 714m, leaving the market Pounds 125m short. Overnight money was expensive yesterday, trading for the most part at about 11 1/2 per cent. By the close, it had fallen to 10 3/4 - 5/8 per cent - still on the high side, said traders. 'It is an indication that it will be another dour day tomorrow,' commented one dealer, who added that most players were not expecting an imminent cut in rates. He went on to say: 'It might be a political manoeuvre, but it is not likely in this climate.' Sterling's bottom-ranked position within the European exchange rate mechanism appears to be the principal obstacle to a cut. Most of the rates at the short end were similarly pessimistic. One week money closed at 10 3/4 - 5/8 per cent, while the one month rate was 10 5/8 - 1/2 per cent. The key three months interbank rate ended at 10 3/8 - 5/16 per cent. The March short sterling contract took the contrary view, finishing at 89.84. At that level the market is discounting a reduction in rates before the contract falls due on March 16. In Germany, call rates were steady at 9.55/65 per cent. Traders were anxious that call money could approach the Lombard rate of 9.75 per cent, if the Bundesbank did not provide enough liquidity in this week's round of securities repurchase agreements.</p>

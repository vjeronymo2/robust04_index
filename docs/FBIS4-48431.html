			<p>BFN     [Text] The UN Office for Humanitarian Assistance  Coordination [UNOHAC] reports that some 75 percent of the more  than 3.7 million displaced persons had already been settled  throughout the country by February 1994. UNOHAC says just over  950,000 people still need to be resettled, the largest number of  which are in Sofala, Tete, and Gaza Provinces. The figures  refer to people forced to abandon their areas because of the war  and natural disasters. It was estimated that there was just  over 5 million displaced persons, including 1.5 million refugees  in neighboring countries when the General Peace Accord was  signed in October 1992.</p>

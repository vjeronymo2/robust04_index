			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Construction Contracts: Motorway project in North Yorkshire AMEC has secured three new projects with a total value in excess of Pounds 100m. The largest, in joint venture with Alfred McAlpine, is a Pounds 54m contract to build a 21km section of the A 1(M) between Walshford and Dishforth in North Yorkshire. The joint venture will build the new three lane carriageway to the west of the existing A1, upgrading this stretch of the route to motorway standard. The project represents the first milestone in the government's 1990 proposals to upgrade the entire A1 between the M25 and Tyneside. The second is from British Gas West Midlands, which has awarded AMEC Utilities four period contracts estimated to be worth in the region of Pounds 33m. Running for a fixed period of three years, the work will cover the whole of the West Midlands area and involves replacement of mains and services and installation of services. The last is a Pounds 20m contract for AMEC in Singapore, in joint venture with local company MAE Engineering, for the Pontiac Marina project. The contract involves mechanical and electrical services, air conditioning, fire protection and pool and fountain installations. The project is due for completion in October 1995 and consists of a 41-storey office tower, a retail podium and two car park levels. The contract was awarded by main contractor Dragages et Travaux Publics Pte.</p>

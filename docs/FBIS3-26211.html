			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 3 (XINHUA) -- Bo Yibo, a retired  veteran Chinese leader, said that China must combine development  speed with high economic returns.    In an impromptu speech at a forum here yesterday, he said  that a "comprehensive understanding" of Deng Xiaoping's  exposition on the development speed and economic returns is  essential to maintaining sustained, rapid and healthy growth of  China's economy.    He said that the country's economy is now growing  vigorously,  while initial successes have been made in macro-economic control.    The whole Chinese nation is trying hard to push China's  economy to a new height by following the principle of seizing  the current opportunity for development, deepening the reform,  opening wider to the outside world, promoting development and  maintaining stability, he told the forum on Deng Xiaoping's  ideas concerning the improvement of economic returns.    Bo Yibo also called attention to the fact that low economic  returns nationwide remain largely unchanged. For example, the  composite index for industrial economic returns fell at the end  of 1993.    He warned against the bad tendency rising in some localities  toward blindly undertaking construction projects, overextending  the construction scale, blindly seeking development speed and  neglecting economic returns.    "The scale of fixed assets investment is so large as to  exceed what China's financial capabilities can withstand," he  said.    He criticized some mass media organizations for failing to  highlight the importance of improving economic returns.    Under these circumstances, it is necessary to spread Deng  Xiaoping's ideas on combining the development speed with  economic returns to make sure that high speed and high economic  returns promote each other.    Over the past ten-plus years, Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly  stressed that the development speed must be combined with high  economic returns, he said.    "We must try our best to achieve a relatively high growth  rate," he told the forum.    According to Bo, it is both "possible and necessary" for  China to achieve an annual growth rate of eight to nine percent  in line with its economic strength, financial capabilities and  materials supply.    "We must combine development speed with economic returns,  product quality and market demand," he noted.    He opposed what he called a low development speed and  underproduction which he said will adversely affect the  improvement in China's overall economic strength and living  standards.    Meanwhile, he also warned against excessive stockpiles and  redundant construction. Inventories of manufacturers covered in  government budgets amounted to 170 billion yuan at the end of  last year, he added.    He said that the combination of high speed with high  economic  returns serves as an "inevitable road" for China to achieve  modernization in three phases.    "This is not only an economic issue, but also a political  issue," he said in conclusion.</p>

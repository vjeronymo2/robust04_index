			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN HIT BY TRUCK PLUNGES TO DEATH IN PIT  </P> <P> A driverless truck careened down a steep hill in downtown Los Angeles Friday  morning, hit a passing car, then struck a man as he waited for a light --  knocking him through a plywood fence to his death at the bottom of an 80-foot  construction pit.  </P> <P> Another pedestrian was injured in the bizarre accident about 10:30 a.m. at the  intersection of Grand Avenue and 5th Street, across the street from the  Biltmore.  </P> <P> The driver of the truck, who was not immediately identified, had parked it on  the hill on Grand between 4th and 5th streets, locked it and had gone into a  nearby building, said Lars Oakander, a Los Angeles police detective.  </P> <P> For some reason, the vehicle started to roll, picking up considerable speed,  the detective said.  </P> <P> An unidentified passer-by ran alongside the Ford pickup trying to get inside,  but the doors were locked, Oakander said.  </P> <P> "He tried to hold the truck back" with his hands, Oakander added. "But you know  what it's like trying to hold onto a vehicle when it's moving."  </P> <P> Only a stack of wood, he said, kept the pickup from plunging into the huge,  concrete-lined pit, which is to be a four-story underground parking garage for  the Los Angeles Central Library.  </P> <P> The dead man was identified a Francisco Molina Espinoza, 38, of La Puente.  </P> <P> He suffered massive injuries and fractures as he fell into the pit and struck a  series of steel supports, Oakander said.  </P> <P> The second pedestrian, an unidentified man who also had been waiting for a  light to change, was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital, where he was treated and  released. The driver of the car that was struck apparently was not hurt.  </P> <P> Jonas Matz, a movie crew medical technician, was working inside the Biltmore  when he heard that there had been an accident. He grabbed his medical bag and  ran to the scene.  </P> <P> "I climbed over the hood of the truck and suddenly there was this huge hole  that I didn't expect," he said. "I looked down and there was a construction  worker standing on a little platform about halfway down. I don't know if he  jumped out of the way or what."  </P> <P> The construction worker, who was not injured, pointed out the body at the  bottom of the hole. Matz said Espinoza was unconscious when he reached him and  died minutes later.  </P> <P> No charges have been filed against the truck's owner.  </P> <P> Police did not know if he had put the truck's emergency brake on or if the  truck was in park or neutral, Oakander said.  </P> <P> Charges could be filed later if the truck owner is found to have acted  negligently, Oakander said.  </P></p>

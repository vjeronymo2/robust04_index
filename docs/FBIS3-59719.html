The particle does not  easily dissolve in living bodies and it can envelop internally  any drug as long as the drug has the characteristic of repelling  water. It is expected to help increase the types of drugs that  can be used in the DDS (drug delivery system) which is  attracting attention as a new pharmaceutical technology.    The developers were groups from Mr. Mitsuo Okano, Assistant  Professor of Tokyo Womens Medical College, Engineering Research  Facility for Medical Usage and Mr. Kazunori Kataoka, Assistant  Professor of Science University of Tokyo, Basic Engineering  Section. When macromolecule chain composed of hydrophobic group  which is water insoluble and hydrophilic group which is water  soluble is reacted with water, the hydrophobic portion of the  chain will aggregate and this characteristic hydrophobic bonding  is what has been used.    First, the macromolecule chain that connects the string like  hydrophilic macromolecule polyethylene oxide and hydrophobic  polyamino acid is dissolved in an organic solvent and to it, a  hydrophobic drug is added. When this is gradually transferred  into water solution, the string portion of the hydrophobic group  will aggregate as the drug is taken in while the surface becomes  covered with the hydrophillic chain as it produces a  macromolecular particle (micelle).    Since the drug is physically wrapped by the particle, the  technology will apply to any drug as long as it is hydrophobic.  In the past, there has been macromolecule micelles that have  been formed from chemically bonding the drug to the string  portion of the hydrophobic section.    However, if the drug does not have the amino group to form a  chemical bond, it would not be able to enter the micelle. Many  of the anticancer drugs are hydrophobic and it is said that this  development will broaden the area of DDS application.    The surface of the macromolecular micelle is hydrophilic so  that it attaches to the living body with ease and will not  readily be destroyed by the immune cells in the blood system.  The special structure called aggregates characteristically has a  more stable existence compared to liposome which is made from  artificial lipid membrane and also has expectations of being  useful as DDS. Furthermore, the size of the particle has a  diameter of 30-50 nanometers (one nanometer is one hundred  millionth of a meter) and it can easily pass through the cancer  cell blood vessels and it is said that it has a tendency to  gather at the site of the cancer.    Experimentally, the anticancer drug, adriamycin was  physically inserted to form a macromolecule micelle, then added  to cultivated cancer cell and during ten days, it was confirmed  that the anticancer drug was slowly being released. The  effectiveness of the anticancer drug was said to be  approximately the same as when adriamycin alone was reacted. Up  to now, the research group has produced macromolecular micelle  that contains indometacin that is being used as an  anti-inflammation drug.</p>

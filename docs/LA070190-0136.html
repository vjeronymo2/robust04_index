Military ruler Omar Hassan Ahmed Bashir, who  overthrew democratically elected Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi last year, gave few  details of the proposed conference, saying only that it would reject individual  dictatorship, one-party or sectarian rule. Later, hundreds of thousands of  people in Khartoum demonstrated in support of Bashir's rule, according to the  official Sudan News Agency.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Sali Berisha received Kosovar President  Ibrahim Rugova today. Both presidents discussed extensively the  development of democratic reforms in Albania, problems related  to the Albanian question, and the situation in the region. They  considered important both for Albania and the region the last  efforts of the Albanian Government to develop and strengthen  regional cooperation and friendship with regional countries,  such as Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], the European  Union countries, other European countries, and so forth.    Presidents Berisha and Rugova assessed as successful and  important the visits and meetings of President Rugova in the  North Atlantic Assembly, where the grave situation in Kosova and  the possibilities of resolving this problem were addressed. The  assembly meeting provided extensive support to the policy of  Albanians in Kosova and their civil resistance against the  Serbian occupation.    They also assessed as very important the visits and recent  meetings of President Rugova with high-level government members  and other officials in Denmark, Norway, France, and Germany.  All these meetings revealed a great concern on the part of  these countries regarding the violation of freedoms and national  rights of the Albanians in Kosova and their determination to  seriously contribute to resolving the Kosova question.    Both presidents assessed positively the serious efforts of  the international community to establish a dialogue between  Prishtina and Belgrade in the presence of a third party on the  reestablishment and functioning of democratic institutions and  the solution of Kosova's political status. They welcomed the  efforts and indications that encourage the start of a dialogue.    Both presidents considered that the cooperation between  Albania and Macedonia is important for peace and stability in  the south of the Balkans. They were also of the opinion that  Macedonia's membership in the CSCE as a member with full rights  not only serves this state but provides a real impetus to a  further respect for freedoms and human and national rights of  the Albanians in Macedonia, which is a condition for the  stability of this republic.    They considered as a very important step the implementation  of the census, which is in conformity with the standards and  criteria of the law recommended by the group of experts and  approved by the Macedonian Parliament.    Both presidents think that Albania's relations with Greece  are important both for the two countries and the region and that  there exist real possibilities to resolve the disagreements  through dialogue. Albania respects and is committed to  respecting the fundamental freedoms and rights of the Greek  minority. These rights, alongside those of the Albanians, have  been subject to deeply spectacular positive changes and they  will be further expanded in the future.    Both presidents also stressed that the freeing of aid for  the  balance of payments and the continuation of aid for Albania by  the European Union is of extraordinary importance for the  progress of the reforms in Albania and its active role in  preserving peace and stability in the region.</p>

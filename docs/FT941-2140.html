			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Management Education &amp; Training (3): Rival benchmark gains in credence - British NVQs Mr Andrew Summers, chief executive of the Management Charter Initiative, a body set up in 1988 to improve the quality of UK managers, is often asked by employers about the relative merits of different management qualifications. 'Until recently, the only management qualification with standing was the MBA,' says Mr Summers, 'but I believe the higher level national vocational qualifications (NVQs) at levels four and five will in time be established as a qualification with equivalent currency.' It is an ambitious hope as well as being a controversial one. NVQs, unlike the MBA, which is acquired through either full-time or part time study, are competence-based, depending on what an individual is able to do in his or her workplace, rather than what he or she knows. Wider adoption of NVQs in the field of management qualifications thus has significant implications - not least for business schools where MBAs are an important income generator. A full-time course at a top school can cost up to Pounds 20,000. Accreditation of an NVQ level four or five in management is a much cheaper option. Candidates typically have to demonstrate in their workplace, to trained assessors who are not their direct line managers, that they can perform a number of management jobs. The many modules of the qualification include managing operations, and financial competence. NVQs do not, however, formally test the knowledge of the candidate through examination, and it is here is that the gulf emerges between proponents of NVQs and MBAs. The NVQ framework has been set up as part of the government's strategy for addressing askills shortage in the UK compared with its main competitors. The qualifications start at NVQ level one, a basic competency in performing a given task, and cover most blue collar jobs. They are slowly being extended into the professions. The lower level NVQs have attracted some criticism but the greatest suspicion and hostility has been encountered at higher levels, particularly from professional bodies, defending the traditional system of testing knowledge by examination. 'The NVQ cannot be a substitute for the MBA, an academic qualification which includes some practical work,' says Mr Alan France, dean of the business school at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston. 'Academic inquiry is a useful skill for managers to acquire, and experience cannot be a substitute for the ability to reflect.' It is a criticism that Mr Summers, chief executive of the Management Charter Initiative, takes on board. 'There are no formal examinations for the level four and five NVQs in management but there is a requirement that candidates demonstrate that they have the underpinning knowledge,' he says. 'In practice, this means that the information and skills required to do a task - such as developing teams and individuals - will be acquired through a variety of means: by imitating best practice of colleagues; by attending courses at college; or by personal reading.' Typically, he says, it would take an individual between six and 18 months to demonstrate that they had the competency to carry out these tasks, and this could include a substantial amount of study, and evidence in support. The merits of NVQs as distinct from the MBA qualification are, he believes, a matter of horses for courses. 'An employer considering sponsoring his employees for either NVQs or the MBA should ask what his or her business objectives were, and what key skills needed to be developed,' he says. 'Some employers would say they needed to develop practical skills, such as team-building, or setting up a quality programme. The attainment of the level four and five management NVQs could be part of the package equipping individuals with those skills, whereas if the need was for strategic planning or analysis, a more formal input from a business school might be more appropriate.' Conversely, business schools acknowledge that the NVQ may have some merit and they are examining whether or not practical aspects of their MBAs can be accredited as NVQs. There is a financial reason for this. In a highly competitive marketplace, candidates for NVQs are eligible for tax relief on fees, such as those charged for accreditation of the qualification. For this reason, Cranfield School of Management is discussing with the Inland Revenue whether it will recognise the practical parts of the school's MBA as the equivalent of the NVQ levels four or five. If the Inland Revenue does not agree, the school will consider making the competence parts of its MBA NVQs in order to obtain the tax reduction.' It seems highly unlikely NVQs will replace the MBA. The measurement of competences as assessed by NVQs is only one aspect of management education and may not be the most important one,' Professor Colin New of Cranfield says.</p>

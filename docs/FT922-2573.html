			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Move to defuse row at business school VIGOROUS efforts are being made to defuse the row over the future of Manchester Business School that led its advisory council and Professor Tom Cannon, the school's director, to resign last month. The 14 industrialists on the council complained of high-handed treatment by Manchester University, which has now redefined the school's role and decided to abolish the council. The business school is a graduate and post-doctoral research institution and is part of the university. The government has refused to intervene formally, but Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Universities' Funding Council, has asked Sir Dennis Landau, former chairman of the business school's council, to state his terms for resuming office. It seems likely that the government has asked Sir Ron to use his influence. Sir Dennis, chief executive of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, says he will reconsider only if asked to do so by Prof Martin Harris, who will become vice-chancellor of the university in August. Mr Chris Kenyon, chairman of the governing council for the entire university, says the university authorities had believed that Prof Cannon and the business school's council wanted greater autonomy for the school. He says the university council cannot see why the 14 felt they had to resign. Sir Dennis says the 14 would have stayed if the words 'after consultation' had been added to a new university ordinance, giving the business school council a statutory right to a say in its own affairs, such as disposal of assets. Mr Kenyon says that if a compromise involving just two words was on offer, no one on the university side realised it. The university plans to federate the business school with the mainly undergraduate University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (Umist) and the university's department of accounting. Sir Dennis doubts that this will work. He and his fellow former councillors are concerned that it might devalue the Master of Business Administration degree. MBA students fear that a change in the balance between the course's vocational and academic content could dilute their marketability as doers rather than thinkers. The Franks Report on management education - which led to the setting up of business schools in Manchester and London nearly 30 years ago - recognised the tension between the academic and the vocational as a case for autonomy. The Manchester school council relied on a written definition of its quasi-autonomous position, approved by the university some years ago. Mr Kenyon last week accused Prof Cannon of leading the school's council astray over the extent of its autonomy. Prof Cannon says the written definition made the position quite clear. It is this confusion Prof Harris has to resolve. Ironically, a search is already under way for yet more industrialists to serve on a new business school body, which the university says will function as an executive board. Favourite for chairman is Prof Sir Roland Smith, chairman of Umist's fundraising committee and former chairman of British Aerospace.</p>

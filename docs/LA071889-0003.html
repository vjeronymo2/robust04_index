			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> European Community foreign ministers agreed to send emergency food aid to  Poland pending a wider international effort to tackle structural problems of  food supply there. The 12 ministers were responding to the decision at the  Paris summit by the seven leading industrialized democracies to ask the  European Community to coordinate help for economic reforms in Poland and  Hungary. A preparatory meeting of officials of the 12 community governments  will be held soon to prepare a conference to examine ways to help Polish  agriculture overcome problems causing chronic shortages.  </P></p>

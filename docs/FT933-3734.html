			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / How to Spend it: The simple bare accessories of life . . . - The eternal question: what to buy the man who has everything. Paul Keers has a few tips for those with cash to spare MEN'S accessories are big business. They are landmark purchases, bought to commemorate achievements and anniversaries, when people are happy to pay a little more for a memorable item. Essentially, they are the male equivalent of jewellery; expensive bits of decorative metal. But unlike jewellery, they have a function, which excuses their presence on an executive desk-top or in a trouser pocket. Many, of course, are bought by women, as gifts for those men who have everything. That is why accessories come in matching ranges; one successful gift can then be followed by a succession of coordinating items, in what one marketing man describes as 'executive desk-dressing'. But from lighters to blotters, keyrings to penknives, most accessories are inherently nostalgic. They evoke an image of a traditional man. No-one has yet begun to market silver-plated computer accessories, or designer car alarm keyrings; instead, the functions of men's accessory ranges are locked in a bygone era. And so, manufacturers produce ashtrays for a generation of men who no longer smoke; blotters and inkwells for executives who only work on screens; desk-top lighters for smoke-free offices; and tie-tacks and cufflinks for men who work in polo shirts. Yet in these times of upheaval, perhaps nostalgia, with its suggestion of permanence, is what men are seeking. As Alan Duddle, Director of Merchandising at Dunhill, explains it: 'In buying a brand new product, in a contemporary design, men are committing themselves to the unknown. Whereas if they buy a nostalgic design, they are buying something which already has longevity and credibility.' The newest accessory ranges for men seem to acknowledge this, and look backwards in their form as well as their function. The results are personal accessories designed to offer the reassurance of the past to the executive who feels unsettled in the present. Later this month, Tiffany is erdorsing this trend, with its first ever line of men's accessories. The range extends from lighter to letter opener, from desk-top ashtray and picture frame to keyring, money clip and cufflinks. Over two dozen items for men, and all in a single style; not the usual contemporary Tiffany look, but a design drawn from the streamline movement of the 1930s. Called Streamerica, the accessories echo the aerodynamic lines of the locomotives, aircraft, dirigibles and cruise ships of the period. Each item has the curved lines, precise seams and rivets in miniature which were the hallmarks of streamlining. To reflect the style, the range has been made, not in silver but, for the first time at Tiffany's, in stainless steel. 'Stainless steel is rarely treated as a precious metal, and given this quality of metalwork,' explains John Loring, Tiffany's director of design. 'Steel is not the same price as silver, but to do your best with it is even more labour intensive than working with silver or gold. To properly mill and finish it is a real labour of love.' The Streamerica items are made with a precision and weight which makes them inherently masculine, in spite of a smooth, sensuous feel. The range is expensive because of the labour involved; a small pocket knife is Pounds 100, an ashtray Pounds 205. But, because the items are in stainless steel, they seem much more appropriate for use today than ostentatious equivalents in precious metal. 'It goes along with our self-imposed sumptuary laws,' agrees Loring. 'It affords the possibility of showing off craftsmanship, rather than expenditure on raw materials.' It seems only right that the range is produced by a company which has a reputation underlining the similarity between men's accessories and women's jewellery. Unlike jewellery, of course, men's accessories do have a veneer of usefulness. But in many cases, it is only a veneer. Is there a male executive senior enough to merit a Pounds 135 Tiffany letter-opener? Tiffany is not the only company to be looking to the past in order to appeal to the modern man. Dunhill's next collection is also based around a 1930s theme. Dunhill maintains a small archive museum, which tracked down dozens of historic items for the company. 'Our centenary forced us to look at some of our older products,' explains the company. 'We realised that, against a background of social and political upheaval, there was something very comfortable in nostalgia. In an unpredictable world, it's reassuring to own something which reflects a time past when things were more comfortable.' So Dunhill has revived ranges of silver flasks, cigar cases, pocket knives and lighters all in designs, and bearing a large hallmark, as featured in their pre-1925 items. There are Sunburst lighters, cufflinks, money- and tie-clips, in silver decorated with boldly-coloured enamel; again, the lighters use a 1930s design. In contrast to brash 'n' flash modern wristwatches that used to typify Dunhill style, there is a range, the Steel Centenary Collection, directly inspired by Alfred Dunhill timepieces of the 1930s. These are elegant, oblong watches, with traditional mechanical movements and blued hands, offering all the design appeal of the past but with the production values of the present. At around Pounds 500, their price is far lower than their precious metal or, indeed, genuine antique counterparts. 'These are progressive, comfortable, up-to-date products,' says Dunhill, 'but they reflect the past.' That may also be the reason behind the current success of Oris watches. This small Swiss company, started in 1904, refused to switch to the quartz technology which transformed the wristwatch market. But, instead of moving into the four-figure luxury market, they have kept their place as mid-market mechanical wristwatches (Pounds 175 to around Pounds 600). And along with the nostalgic sound of ticking, they have also retained the idiosyncratic styling of watches from the middle of the century. To most thirtysomething men, these look like the watches their fathers used to wear. Some models even boast the Oris Big Crown, an over-sized winder designed so that second world war pilots could adjust their watches without removing their gloves. Sold in fashionable outlets, such as The Watch Gallery (Jermyn Street and Sloane Street), they allow modern men to feel just like their fathers, but as if an inherited watch came along with a modern service guarantee. Given the upheavals in design over the past five years or so, many men would now prefer to mark significant occasions with items whose style has stood the test of time. In both their personal and their professional lives, they want to feel linked to a stable past. Clearly, several big companies feel that that might be described as a fact after the accessory.</p>

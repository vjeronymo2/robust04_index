			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Arts: The National smartens up - Off the Wall IF YOU run a hard presed arts organisation and come across anyone called Sackler - grab them. The American Sackler brothers, beneficiaries of a drugs fortune, are a posse of white knights as far as the UK's leading art galleries are concerned. It was the late Arthur, and Jill, Sackler who gave the Royal Academy its smart new galleries. On Tuesday a new Mesopotamia gallery was unveiled at the British Museum, thanks to Raymond and Beverly Sackler; and yesterday the National Gallery announced that Dr Mortimer and Theresa Sackler were giving well over Pounds 1m to renovate one of the grandest, if tattiest rooms, in the Gallery. At the moment it houses 18th Italian art, but in deference to Theresa, who is English, when the new Sackler Room is unveiled it will be home to British art. The National Gallery also revealed that an anonymous friend was giving almost Pounds 1m to restore another gallery. This means that it has raised over Pounds 13m in the last five years to smarten up its original Wilkins building. Now the hunt is on for money to improve the modern northern extension. Unlike many arts organisations the National Gallery seems in good heart: but it must run very hard to stand still. In 1993-94 its government grant is Pounds 16.5m, but it expects to spend over Pounds 25m. Just five years ago the government covered virtually all its costs, but now that the Gallery has Trustee status it must bridge a growing gap in its finances from its own efforts. It means that the chairman of the Trustees, Nicholas Baring, and director Neil MacGregor, are constantly tapping the shoulders of potential benefactors. The main problem is the disappearance of a specific purchasing grant from the government. The Gallery finds it difficult to raise money for acquisitions, especially as it it still paying Lord Cholmondeley Pounds 2.5m a year for the Holbein 'Lady with a Squirrel' which it acquired in 1992. Its annual report shows only three very minor purchases last year, but important paintings sold at auction to foreign buyers included works by Daumier, Goya and Ribera. The Japan Festival of 1991 must be the only major festival in the UK since the Great Exhibition of 1851 to end up with a surplus. Most of its Pounds 20m funding came from pre-recession Japan and the UK organisers were continually amazed at the sums that belatedly landed in their laps. But it is not being squandered. Each year the Japan Festival Fund will give prizes with an annual value of around Pounds 30,000 to British cultural ventures which continue to demythologize Japan to the British. The first batch was distributed this week with the injunction from the chairman of the judges, Sir Kit McMahon, that there were no restrictions on how the money was spent. 'You can even speculate against the Yen with it.' The biggest winner was the Lyric Hammersmith for its season of Japanese plays. The judges could hardly have picked an arts institution more in need of Pounds 15,000. The Lyric is believed to be on the Arts Council's list of ten clients set to lose their grant - which in the Lyric's case accounts for Pounds 300,000, or roughly a third of its income. Although the Council remains adamant that some clients will be discarded, it is back-tracking slightly. There will be another review, and if the government comes up with more money for the arts in the November budget, four of the ten might be saved. The Council is not optimistic about reversing the proposed Pounds 5m cut in its grant, the first actual reduction in its budget since 1979. Yet, at one level a lower grant helps the Arts Council. It gives it someone to blame as it pushes ahead with its desire to redistribute Pounds 1.4m from drama to contemporary dance and the visual arts. But it cannot escape opprobrium. If theatres like Plymouth, Oldham and Watford are on the hit list substantially populated areas will be deprived of professional drama, for it is unlikely that these theatres can maintain a reasonable programme without a subsidy that accounts for over 30 per cent of their income. Such an eventuality is expressly against the Council's charter to bring the arts to every part of the UK. This whole saga still has a few twists in it, but the Council has committed so much energy to its new policy of being on the 'cutting edge' of the arts that some sacrificial victims seem inevitable. Stephen Daldry, now in sole charge at the Royal Court, announced this week that he was in favour of direct action to restore the cuts in the drama budget threatened by the Arts Council. He was ready to lead a commando raid on the Council, although what would be achieved, apart from a plot line for a Royal Court play, is uncertain. His reign at the Court seems set to combine controversy with a hard headed financial stewardship. There is likely to be an outcry over a November production, MSM, the first verbal work by choreographer Lloyd Newson of DV8, the dance company. It looks at the issue of cottaging, sexual contacts in male toilets. On the other hand the Royal Court should have another profitable transfer when David Mamet's Oleanna moves to the West End. The Royal Court has done well out of developing links with the US. It has found a rich friend in the Audrey Skirball-Kenis Foundation, which has promised it Dollars 100,000 a year for three years to bring new American works to London and send Royal Court writers to Los Angeles. Daldry pinpointed the crisis in contemporary British drama. In the past there was a loyal audience for the Court's new plays which guaranteed it a fair audience of 45 per cent of capacity. No play at the Court has played to this level of capacity for three years. It either presents hits, or total misses. More news from the Lyric Hammersmith. Its new artistic director is to be Neil Bartlett, who coincidentally has written a new work, a musical, for the Royal Court, Night After Night, which opens in late November. It seems quite the fashion for artistic directors to spend their time in rival theatres: Daldry has no current plans to direct at the Court but is working at the National Theatre.</p>

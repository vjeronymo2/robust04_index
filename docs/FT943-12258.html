			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Lex Service Lex Service, Britain's largest car distribution and leasing group, is expected to report a sharp increase in interim pre-tax profits this week. The rise follows exceptional gains on the sale of the last tranche of shares in Arrow Electronics, which it received in part payment for the disposal of its North American electronic components distribution businesses to Arrow in September 1991. Analysts predict profits will climb to Pounds 31m (Pounds 21.2m) under FRS 3 when the group announces its results tomorrow. Yesterday's Financial Times incorrectly reported that the results were due today.</p>

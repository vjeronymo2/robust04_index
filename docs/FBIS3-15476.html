He noted that "social appropriations are now responsible for  70 per cent of the entire defence budget". According to the  deputy minister, whole cities which mushroomed next to munitions  factories, are maintained at the expense of the defence order.    Kokoshin stressed that "the intention of the Finance  Ministry  to cut considerably the defence order this year may result in a  collapse of key defence industries and will negatively tell on  the fate of 15 million people".    In Kokoshin's opinion, even the present defence order "is  below the requirements of the Armed Forces".    He underlined that the Defence Ministry is guided by the  need  to preserve the main high-tech industries. The deputy minister  "had in mind industries manufacturing both military products and  civil technologies.    He pointed to the need for enlisting investments in the  defence complex from the non-state sector. "We need major  enterprises and industrial-financial groups. In future, many  types of weapons can be financed with inner funds," he explained.    Kokoshin also noted that cuts for defence "can negatively  tell on the export of Russian weaponry". In his opinion, "the  difficult position at our enterprises will undermine Russian  export positions".</p>

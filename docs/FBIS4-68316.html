			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Comments by Vladimir Polevanov, governor of Amur Oblast, to </F> Nikolay Beliy, special correspondent for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI,  dateline Amur Oblast: "Will There Be a Cosmodrome on the Amur?;"  first paragraph is source introduction]    [Text] The large national project for the  construction of a new Russian cosmodrome on the Amur could  wither in the "coordination" stage. Commenting at the request of  the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent on the possibility of the  construction of a new domestic cosmodrome between the Amur and  Zeya rivers, the governor of the Amur Oblast, Vladimir  Polevanov, had no idea, it seems, what effect his affirmative  response would engender.    The issue centers on the creation of a unique testing ground  from which heavy-lift launchers such as Proton, Zenit, and even  Energiya would be able to place in orbit virtually any space  vehicle. Whether the far reaches of Russia will become the space  "New Vasyuks" is a question that, more than anything else,  depends on money.    But the position of the leadership of the oblast is  pragmatic  and therefore, on the outside only, appears immovable. The  project -- if, of course, it is carried out -- will bring into  the weak economy of the Amur region large capital investment,  will create new jobs, and will raise the prestige of a poor far  eastern province. The opposition has its own radically opposite  point of view: the idea is bad, and the site itself won't hold  up to criticism.    You'll recall how three years ago, in this same place, in  the  Amur region, a project almost as large and of an international  nature was successfully frozen. At that time, when the first  administration of the Amur Oblast was still in office, the plan  called for throwing up an automobile/train bridge across the  border-running Amur, near Blagoveshchensk. Now the third  administration is in office. But everything is still the way the  dacha holders across whose plots the transcontinental highway  was to be built decided long ago it would be. The bridge isn't  being built, even though there is even a special decree of the  Government of Russia to have it done. Won't the new project,  which also has an international significance -- China and Japan  have already shown their interest in it -- meet the same fate?    Before it even came about, the project divided scientists,  specialists, and residents of the region into two camps. The  opponents of the Russian Baykonur are facing an entire social  committee created to protect the future cosmodrome. Newspapers  boldly manipulating the "public vote" are drawing horrible  scenes of massive catastrophe. The far easterners are predicting  a global apocalypse: the stages from the spacecraft that are  launched will start falling on the heads of the Amur residents,  and the jarring of the soil will cause earthquakes, which will  cause the Zeya Hydroelectric Station reservoir to fill up to the  brim, and the water will break the dam, and every living thing  for hundreds of kilometers around will perish.    But the local residents are responding calmly to the gloomy  predictions, and no one is running out of the places where the  construction is supposed to be. Just the opposite -- people are  declaring their readiness to work on Russia's future launch  complex. A purely economic factor is at work: getting permanent,  high-paying work and joining the ranks of contractors for a  project that has state-level status means resolving the issue of  one's own well-being, not to mention survival. Judging from  everything, that's how the situation was sized up by the group  that makes up the Amurstroyproyekt joint-stock company, one of  the first to proffer its services to the military.    Why the military? The fact is that the new Russian  cosmodrome  is expected to be built in places in which, until only recently,  the military were the main dramatis personae. The missile units,  closed to journalists and concentrated in the forests and knolls  near the Amur section of the Trans-Siberian Railroad, all went  under the name of Svobodnyy-18. Not far from Svododnyy were the  "articles" with nuclear entrails. Missiles without warheads  were, the military say, launched from the silos there on a  regular basis, and nobody had a problem with that, because, they  say, nobody knew about it.    Thanks for the disclosure, especially since it comes from  someone who should know. From, for example, the strategic  missile forces division commander, Maj.-Gen. Aleksandr  Vinidiktov. In doling out information to the press, he told  about how, today already, they -- the military -- are literally  being assaulted with requests that they employ machine operators  from nearby settlements. They're taking many of them.    The residents themselves of the town of Svobodnyy-18 are  divided about the possible transfer to the aegis of the  military-space department. Most of the officers, who often work  without pay, are for it. Space to them is not just some abstract  world -- it's a means of achieving strictly earthbound goals.  The facility, my conversation partner assured me, presents no  serious danger. the nuclear weapons that used to be in the  military units (those missiles have been removed from the  military's possession) represented a much greater threat to the  entire region.    But the issue of the construction of a far eastern  cosmodrome  is not yet settled. Having studied the circumstances,  specialists have acknowledged that Svobodnyy-18 is one of the  best places in Russia to build a space launch complex. In fact,  it won't even be a cosmodrome, but rather the main center for  testing and adapting space systems. Again, that's if it ends up  there. One thing is certain and indisputable: there won't be any  nuclear testing in that center.    Despite the encouraging last phrase of the professional  missileman, the decision won't be an easy one for Moscow or  Blagoveshchensk to make. Local patriots suggest that the Russian  Baykonur be built wherever is best, but not on the Amur. Of  course, one can't tackle such a grandiose project, one that is  capable of attracting the attention of the world community,  without performing in-depth analysis, above all ecological  analysis. But what's also indisputable is the fact that the fate  of a facility that is strategically important for this power  can't be decided by a simple vote. By the way, in America, they  built a cosmodrome in a resort state, Florida, on the basis both  of national interests and local interests. But this issue, I  repeat, is a state issue and isn't to be resolved as if it were  otherwise. In fact, we're not Florida.</p>

			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> SCIENTISTS DETECTED NO QUAKE WARNINGS  </P> <P> U.S. Geological Survey scientists said the October earthquake in the Bay Area  was "not encouraging" for scientists who hope someday to be able to provide  warnings of major temblors. A major earthquake should reveal through various  precursors that it is about to strike, scientists have theorized. But William  Prescott of the Geological Survey said "there was nothing that we could clearly  identify" as a precursor of the Oct. 17 quake. Prescott spoke at the fall  meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco.  </P></p>

The meeting was chaired by Mr. Mourad Cherif, minister of  foreign trade, foreign investments, and handicrafts. [passage  omitted]    After the meeting, Mr. Mourad Cherif, minister of foreign  trade, foreign investments, and handicrafts, made the following  statement:    [Begin Cherif recording] Since 1986, the member states of  GATT have been holding the Uruguay talks. These negotiations  ended on 15 December last year with an agreement which will be  signed on 15 April this year.    It honors me to announce that the choice of the  participating  parties has fallen on the city of Marrakech to host the trade  ministers' meeting during April this year. That was in response  to a proposal by His Majesty King Hassan II, may God make him  victorious. The final agreement of the Uruguay rounds will be  signed during this meeting and the birth of the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will be announced.    This choice is proof of confidence in and excellence of our  country on the international sphere, and puts the seal on our  encouraging and recorded economic achievements during a decade  of structural reform. [passage omitted]    The success of the Uruguay rounds, God willing, will add  (?100) billion dollars to world revenue until the year 2000,  according to a study carried out by the World Bank and the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.    The reduction in tariffs which the participating parties  will  give will enable Moroccan goods to enter foreign markets. The  signing of the agreement in the city of Marrakech will give  positive and important results to the Moroccan economy in  general and our exports in particular. [end recording]</p>

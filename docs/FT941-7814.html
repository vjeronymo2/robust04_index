			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Arts: The Kitchen - Theatre 'If you can't stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen.' On the other hand, President Truman's motto always seemed like an invitation to get into the thick of it. And so it is with Stephen Daldry's magnificent revival of Arnold Wesker's play at the Royal Court. Even the theatre has been transformed. Part of the audience sits on what used to be the stage. The huge kitchen is placed in what was once the front stalls. Excitement rises on the moment of entry. The Kitchen, first performed without decor at the Court in 1959 and then in its present full-length version in 1961, can be seen on several levels. First, it is a piece of triumphant theatricality: a cast of 28, bitching, quarrelling, joking, loving, occasionally running amok but usually getting on with the job of dishing up meals for a busy London restaurant. No food is served; even Wesker recognised that cooking on stage would be impractical. All that is mimed. For the rest, all the implements are there and all the staff in their strange hierarchy: kitchen porters, waitresses running in and out, pastry cooks, the chef and sometimes the restaurateur. The production is worth seeing for this versatility alone. The interchanges never stop, even when lunch-time demand is at its peak: an odd flirtation here, a social comment there, a few broken plates, yet somehow the service goes on. Watch, for example, the riveting performance by the perpetually smoking Annette Badland in the minor part of Bertha, a vegetable cook. I single her out partly because, in this theatre in the round, she worked close to where I sat: if the other small players are anything like as good, the production is even better than I have suggested. The surprise is that the underlying symbolism remains effective. It works because it is unobtrusive. The other meaning of the kitchen ovens is clear without being stressed. A dark-looking Cypriot called Gaston in the kitchen quarrels with one of the Germans, but they more or less patch it up. More strikingly, the German Peter - the boiled fish chef and the main character in the piece, played by Christopher Fulford - makes it up with the Jew. There is an Irishman called Kevin (Dermot Kerrigan) who works on fried fish and an English tramp (Sam Beazley) openly borrowed from Harold Pinter's The Caretaker. All these characters act together: all have dreams, like Michael the hamburger chef who imagines the football score Leyton Orient 18 Arsenal nil. The ageing restaurateur played by Ric Morgan makes his main appearance towards the end wondering what has gone wrong when the place blows up. He has paid high wages, done his best to serve his customers and is plainly Jewish. Yet nothing is rubbed in and there is no preaching. The Kitchen has stood the test of time: under Daldry's loving treatment it has matured. This is a very humane play.</p>

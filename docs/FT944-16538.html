			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Beijing battens down for tricky time ahead: Rumours are feeding anxiety Beijing, in these mellow autumn days, conveys an impression of orderliness with the usual parade of visiting dignitaries shuffling through the Great Hall of the People. Chinese leaders are conspicuously conducting business as normal, receiving visitors, holding meetings, embarking on overseas trips, exhorting the masses to greater endeavour, while steadfastly avoiding in public the issue of the day - the failing health of the senior leader, Deng Xiaoping. Beneath the apparent calm the mood in the capital and in other centres is skittish. Speculation is intense about the condition of Mr Deng, which is said to have worsened considerably since mid-year. Among indications of the high degree of anxiety were the wild gyrations last week of the Shanghai stock exchange, where the index plummeted by 40 per cent before recovering most of the lost ground on Friday, after the Foreign Ministry issued a statement to the effect the Chinese patriarch was in 'good health'. While this routine bulletin calmed the markets momentarily, it will not stop the endless rumours which clearly have become a factor in Chinese political life, complicating a smooth transition from one generation of leaders to the next. Inevitably policy pronouncements, personnel changes and even the vaguest utterances by the leadership are being viewed through the prism of what they mean for the post-Deng era. A political transformation has been under way for some time, but it is accelerating as the moment for Mr Deng's demise draws nearer. Thus, the recent fourth plenary session of the 14th Central Committee was notable not for any significant new initiatives, but for the impression given that the ruling party was seeking to batten down the hatches in preparation for what promises to be a difficult time ahead. The plenum resolution, Major Issues on Strengthening Party Building, hardly smacked of self-confidence at an uncertain moment. The concerns expressed indicated deep misgivings about the state of the organisation and its 54m members. 'The Party', the plenum document stated, 'must be capable of re-organising, enhancing and upgrading itself under the new situation of reform and opening-up, and conscientiously study and solve the new contradictions that crop up during its self-building'. While the resolution made the required references to ideology, these lacked conviction. The document also provided no sense that the party had decided the time was ripe to strike out in new political directions to cope with the momentous economic and social changes under way. Chinese leaders may be seeking to convey the impression that it is 'business as usual' in Beijing by continuing to engage in a welter of high-profile diplomatic activity, but it seems the reform momentum is slowing for the time being, pending Mr Deng's departure from the scene. Observers were surprised that the party plenum failed to address economic questions, suggesting this indicated divisions in the leadership on issues such as the pace of reform of faltering state enterprises. Worries about inflation, which has been running at about 30 per cent in the cities, are casting something of a pall over the reform effort. The strange 'end of an era' mood in Beijing was exemplified last week with the convening of a four-day symposium marking the 2,545th anniversary of the birth of Confucius, the sage vilified during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s as the patron of a 'slave-owning' aristocracy. Now, Confucius is being hailed by the Chinese media as an exemplar of the standards to which society should aspire. Even People's Daily, the party newspaper and leader in its day of the campaign to excoriate Confucius, joined the chorus. Commending Confucian values of filial piety and altruism, the paper warned that 'money worship' was eroding the values of society, and morality had 'lost its sacred meaning'. It is perhaps revealing of present uncertainties that as Mr Deng, veteran communist and father of a modernising state, shuffles from the stage, the Confucian legacy is being rehabilitated. These odd cross-currents seem set to continue for the time being.</p>

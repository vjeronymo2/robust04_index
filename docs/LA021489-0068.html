			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> About 80,000 condoms will be distributed free at five San Francisco Bay Area  colleges and universities this week as part of an annual rating contest  scheduled to start today on Valentine's Day. The contest, now in its third  year, began on the Stanford University campus and has since grown to include  the UC campuses at Berkeley and Santa Cruz, as well as San Jose State  University and Santa Rosa Community College. Students who agree to take part in  the survey are given a packet containing eight brands of condoms, an  information sheet and a ballot, said Daniel Bao, director of the Stanford AIDS  Education Project. The packets will be handed out from today through Thursday,  and the ratings are due back on Feb. 28, Bao said. The results should be  available in early April. The contest is designed to increase awareness about  AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, Bao said.  </P></p>

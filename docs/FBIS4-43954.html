			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Excerpts] Motherland Party [ANAP] leader Mesut Yilmaz has  declared that linking U.S. defense aid to Turkey to certain  conditions does not conform with the Turkish-U.S. alliance, and  the Turkish people will react to this. Yilmaz concluded his  contacts in the United States and returned to Turkey. TRT  correspondent Yavuz Yorulmaz reports from Washington:    [Begin recording] [Yorulmaz] [passage omitted] In a news  conference at the end of his contacts, Yilmaz said that public  opinion and lobbies have gained importance in the United States  in recent years. He said that Turkey should be more active with  regard to lobbying activities. As two allied countries, Turkey  and the United States have mutual responsibilities, Yilmaz  pointed out. He noted that in pursuing these relations, Turkey  takes into account world peace as well as the interests of the  two countries. Yilmaz cited the Korean and Gulf wars as  examples. Yilmaz remarked that linking the defense aid to  Turkey does not conform with allied relations.    [Yilmaz] Given the seriousness with which Turkey has treated  its alliance relations with the United States and the sacrifices  it has made to fulfill these relations, Turkey has the right to  expect the same understanding and, if necessary, the same  sacrifice from its U.S. allies at a time when it is facing  certain temporary difficulties.    [Yorulmaz] Pointing out that the Turkish people will react  against conditional military aid, Yilmaz said: If the current  government accepts this aid under these conditions, it will  contradict the will of our people. Yilmaz remarked that the  weight of Congress, public opinion, and lobbies is increasing in  the United States, and Turkey should take this development into  account in its relations with this country. He noted that  anti-Turkish lobbies are currently emphasizing the human rights  issue.    Yilmaz reported that, during the talks, he expressed the  view  that terrorism and the human rights issue should not be confused  with one another. The Cyprus problem was also raised during the  talks, Yilmaz explained, adding that he stressed the importance  of the United Nations acknowledging the conciliatory attitude of  the Turkish Cypriot side.    Pointing out that the Turkish economy is increasingly being  damaged by the embargo imposed on Iraq, Yilmaz said that he  conveyed to the U.S. Administration that this situation must be  rectified without losing more time. He added: The only hopeful  indication I received was that the U.S. Administration will  support the UN procedure to renew the flow of oil in the oil  pipeline.    After his news conference, Yilmaz left the United States for  Turkey. [end recording]    The ANAP leader was received at Ankara's Esenboga Airport by  party leaders and members.</p>

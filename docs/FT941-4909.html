			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Cosy club where favours can be reciprocated Sir, I am not surprised by the praise that Sir David Plastow heaps on to non-executive directors (Letters, March 5). He would say that, wouldn't he? Of course he wishes to perpetuate this cosy club within which chairmen may reward others for past favours or grant retainers and expenses for a few days' attendance a year in exchange for the same favour on the other's board. It is also a means of enhancing pensions for retired MPs and others. Do Americans call them freeloaders? I recall the high numbers of non-execs who served on the boards of some of our one-time great companies like Rolls-Royce and Dunlop before they went into decline. I remember how many times, when the Serious Fraud Office has been called in elsewhere, the non-execs have departed crying: 'These facts were not available to me.' Why is it that company directors think they should receive several concurrent incomes at shareholders' expense? I applaud the policies of BTR, Lonrho and Amstrad. Who is Cadbury anyway?

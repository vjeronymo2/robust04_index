			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Trafalgar rights 89% taken up TRAFALGAR House, the construction, engineering and shipping group, yesterday announced that its shareholders had taken up 89 per cent of its 1-for-2 rights issue at 60p. It ordinary and A shares yesterday rose by 1 1/2 p to 77p and 75p respectively. The rights raised Pounds 204.5m. The rump of the issue, representing 38.8m shares, was placed with the Swiss Bank Corporation by Robert Fleming, the merchant bank handling the issue. SBC has a put option under which Hongkong Land, the Jardine Matheson controlled property company, may be required to purchase up to 67m shares, or about 75m shares adjusting for the rights, representing 7.1 per cent of Trafalgar's stock. SBC is expected to sell the rump of rights to Hongkong Land for about 78p a share. This would take Hongkong Land's 20.7 per cent Trafalgar shareholding above 24 per cent. If SBC exercises all of the put, which it would have to do by May 3, Hongkong Land's stake would rise to about 28 per cent. Its stated aim is to take its Trafalgar holding to 29.9 per cent. Hongkong Land has undertaken not to increase its stake above 29.9 per cent or make a full bid for Trafalgar until April 1 1994, unless a third party offer or tender is made or a third party acquires 15 per cent of the company's shares.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to a report from the secretary of staff to  head of state, information from Head of State Eduard  Shevardnadze concerning Georgia's joining the CIS was circulated  today among the deputies of the Georgian parliament. The  information says: The Georgian parliament must make a  significant decision today on whether or not Georgia should join  the CIS. The significance of this step is stipulated by the  choice that our state is faced with today. Today each one of us  must decide, as our conscience and intelligence prompts us,  whether to follow the path of emotions, illusions and --  proceeding from this -- dashed hopes, or to make a serious  analysis of reality and take a pragmatic attitude to our  everyday issues.    The break-up of the Soviet empire on the one hand created 15  independent states, but on the other hand, it created a new  danger both for the development and existence of these countries  and for the whole world. If events further developed according  to this scenario, they would end with a complete catastrophe.  This is what stimulated the search for the ways out of the  grave situation and in my mind, the creation of the CIS was the  result of this search.    In the beginning the CIS was not a structure that could  effectively resolve the issues of Georgia and other countries,  but, in the meantime, in the process of its self-determination,  a whole range of significant issues were being worked out and  mechanisms for comprehensive cooperation established. Georgia  did participate in the work of different organizations of the  CIS, but this was chiefly in the status of an observer, which  limited our influence on the process of adopting a decision, and  our national interests were not fully observed.    During this period, Georgia tried to regulate relations with  other former Soviet republics. A fairly strong legislative  basis for bilateral political and economic relations was being  dynamically created. However, in the new circumstances and  against the background of the processes of regional integration,  this did not prove to be enough. The development of the  processes within the CIS has once again proved the truth that  securing political, military, and economic interests can only be  carried out effectively if a bilateral cooperation is replaced  by the mechanisms of comprehensive cooperation.    The CIS may not represent a definite guarantee for security,  but it is one of the factors for legally securing our  territorial integrity and the inviolability of our borders.    The regulations of the CIS also envisage the creation of  mechanisms for the member-states' collective security,  eradicating conflicts, and peacefully resolving disputes.    The realization of the CIS regulations will help restore  broken economic links and develop them on a completely new basis  which is a necessary prerequisite for the reforms for transition  to a market economy.    Thus, becoming a member of the CIS will help our country to  establish its place in the network of international and regional  relations, to become a part of the mechanisms of comprehensive  cooperation, and to use agreements on collective security and  economic cooperation for reinforcing with law the country's  territorial integrity, influencing the development of regional  processes, and creating prerequisites for overcoming the  economic crisis.    By becoming a CIS member, our country is proving its  aspiration for civilized development of international relations  and is getting additional means for improving the country's  social and economic situation; it is becoming a fully-fledged  member of the CIS with all relevant rights and, of course,  responsibilities.    The CIS is in its initial stage of formation. The process of  its formation is developing in quite a conflicting manner.  Issues are seldom resolved without hot debates. Discussions  are often uncompromising and severe.    Will the West react negatively to Georgia's joining the CIS?  There are different points of view on this issue in Georgia's  political circles. I have the following point of view: Many  inter-governmental structures have been created since World War  II. Most of them proved viable and many countries poorer than  Georgia have found their way out from the crisis and poverty.  The CIS must share this experience; there will be then less  ground for doubts and we can show everybody what we can do.    The fact that we have already signed comprehensive  agreements  on friendship, cooperation, good-neighborliness, and mutual  assistance with most of the CIS states gives us the hope that on  the basis of work with natural allies we will be able to set up  the CIS as a civilized and integrated union, and Georgia can  make its honorable contribution in this respct.    I am sure that our active participation in the CIS will  assist in overcoming the current crisis, promoting  stabilization, and halting the decline in the population's  standard of living.

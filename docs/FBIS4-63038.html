			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F> Ministry]    [Text] The May actions of the irreconcilable opposition in  Moscow, which ended with the Russian flag being burned and  Rutskoy and his comrades-in-arms appealing for the overthrow of  the present regime, have become the subject of a discussion in  the Kremlin. On this occasion Boris Yeltsin was visited by the  speaker of the upper chamber of parliament Vladimir Shumeyko and  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Shumeyko reported that,  when discussing the problem of ensuring stability in society,  there was an unanimous opinion that any actions of the  irreconcilables, which violate laws and the Constitution, should  be stopped. In the meantime, the Moscow procuracy was  instructed to determine within ten days whether there are  grounds for instituting criminal proceedings on the basis of the  information it possesses.</p>

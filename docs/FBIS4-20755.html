			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interviews with Dr. Fajj al-Nur; Mahmud Fahmi, the former </F> head of the Capital Market Authority, Hasan 'Abbas Zaki, the  former economy minister and chairman of the Arab International  Banking Corporation; and Dr. Hamdi 'Abd-al-'Azim, dean of  al-Sadat Administrative Sciences Academy-Tanta Branch, by  'Ala'-al-Din Mustafa; place and date not given--first seven  paragraphs AKHIR SA'AH introduction]    [Text] Since the promulgation of Law No. 95 of 1992, which  regulates the issuance and exchange of securities and companies  active in securities, there has been incessant talk among  everyone concerned with economic reforms of stimulating the  stock market. However, at the same time, efforts have not been  stepped up to explain and track what is happening in the  securities market. Such efforts are especially needed, because  the legislative tools of economic reform, or the improvement of  the legal frameworks in which investment projects operate, will  not realize the hopes pinned on them for an improvement in the  national economy unless the Egyptian capital market and stock  market resume operating efficiently, to take their place among  international stock markets and capital markets.    In this report, AKHIR SA'AH sheds light on the conditions  and  requirements which must be met to expedite the revival of  Egypt's market. This revival is especially needed in order to  move ahead with privatization through the offering of public  companies' shares on the stock market. These offerings will  achieve the desired goal of expanding the ownership base and  promoting greater activity and vitality in the capital market  and stock market.    We spoke first with Dr. Muhammad Hasan Fajj al-Nur. He  states  that many entered the stock market for the first time after the  promulgation of Law No. 95 of 1992 (the Capital Market Law).  This law is designed to expand the ownership base, develop and  stimulate the capital market, and finance the market directly  through the offering of securities after disclosure of the  financial positions and distributed profits [of the companies  whose shares are offered]. As of 7 January 1994, the General  Capital Market Authority had authorized seven companies, with  76.5 million Egyptian pounds in capital, to engage in securities  activity.    The authority also authorized the issuance of: 248 original  shares amounting to 765.8 million pounds or $101.9 million in  capital, and 138 shares when capital is increased by 975 million  pounds or $39.9 million; and financing instruments and bonds  amounting to 60.5 million pounds in capital.    The authority also issued seven licenses amounting to 30  million pounds in capital, and the establishment of 22 labor  unions, bringing the total number of authorizations to 425  amounting to capital of 190.78 million pounds or $141.8 million.    In addition, the Bank of Egypt was authorized to engage in  investment fund activity and to issue 500 million pounds in  investment certificates, and the National Bank was authorized to  engage in investment fund activity and to issue 100 million  pounds in investment certificates.    According to Dr. Fajj al-Nur, final approval will be given  after a board of directors for the authority is formed.  <H5>  Expansion of the Ownership Base </H5>   [Mustafa] Although more than two years have passed since the  Capital Market Law was promulgated, the market has still not  achieved the desired activity level. Why is this so? Can it be  attributed to reluctance among savings account holders to give  up their desire for and choice of the safe route of saving in  banks, especially after the painful experience of the investment  companies?    [Al-Nur] The investment companies affair undoubtedly casts a  pall on the development of the capital market and on activity in  the stock market. But an objective reading of the development of  stock exchange activity over the past two years shows that there  has been activity and trade. But more time and greater  awareness, which is the media's role, are needed.    Nonetheless, the stock market has undergone technological  development. The Cairo and Alexandria stock markets have been  linked, trading in shares and securities has been computerized,  and operations and trading are monitored on screens.    [Background] Dr. Fajj al-Nur stressed that Egypt's capital  market will succeed only if the privatization program proceeds  in tandem with it. Privatization requires an expansion of the  ownership base through the stock market, not through the  auctioning of public-sector assets. This is especially so given  the privatization program's main aim, which is to expand the  ownership base.    The expansion of the ownership base differs from the concept  of the expansion of the private ownership base. Expansion of the  ownership base entails ownership on a wide scale, i.e., as many  citizens and workers as possible owning the largest number  possible of shares in the companies offered for sale. Expansion  of the private ownership base means auctioning one or more  assets of a company to one or more buyers. The state's goal at  this stage is to deepen the sense of identification by expanding  the ownership base on a wide scale, and to enable capital owners  to obtain the financing they need to increase their investments.  The state aims to achieve this through a strong market that is  based on supervision which relies on transparency and openness.  <H5>  Development and Modernization of the Stock Market </H5>   [Mustafa] Where does Egypt's capital market rank among  international markets?    [Al-Nur] Egypt's capital market, which has begun to attract  attention worldwide, is ranked 20th among 50 recently  established capital markets, according to a ranking of recently  established stock markets performed by Euro Money to measure the  maturity and efficiency of these markets. Taiwan's market is in  first place. The Southeast Asian markets are also ranked highly.  Most of them are in the top 20.    [Background] Dr. Fajj al-Nur states that the following  criteria were used to measure the capital markets' efficiency  and ability to attract foreign investments:     -  Market size, which consists of the market's market value  and the number of securities registered on its stock markets.    -  Liquidity, which is the ratio of the total value transacted  during the past year to the market's total market value.    -  Number of weekly trading hours.    -  Strength of market concentration, which means the percentage  of  market value held by the 10 largest companies, in terms of the  ratio of total market value to their shares traded, and the  ratio of the total value traded to the value of their shares  traded.    -  The cost of a transaction, which includes the broker's  commission, stamp taxes, transaction expenses, and value-added  taxes.    -  The duration of clearance and settlement arrangements.    -  Degree of reserve.    -  The market's ability to attract foreign investments.       According to these criteria, Egypt's capital market is  ranked  20th out of a total of 50 markets that have been developed over  the past decade. This ranking is attributed to the development  of the market which occurred in particular as a result of the  promulgation of Law No. 95 of 1992, which regulates the capital  market. It is also attributed to the programs that were created  to develop and modernize the stock markets, and the  encouragement of the business sector to provide services in the  securities area that had previously been lacking. All of these  factors have done much to promote the attraction of foreign  investments, especially investments by large financial  organizations seeking new markets, especially markets in stable  countries which pursue sound economic policies, in which to  spread their investments.    Dr. Fajj al-Nur emphasizes that the privatization of  public-sector units through the stock market will advance the  capital relative to international capital markets. This will  draw attention to Egypt's capital market as an important, rising  market in the world.  <H5>  The Shares of Public-Sector Companies </H5>   Justice Mahmud Fahmi, the former head of the Capital Market  Authority, believes that the liberalization of Egypt's economy,  progress in the economic reform program, the giving of the  lion's share of the leadership of economic activity to the  private sector, and the success of the privatization policy all  require a strong capital market. Hence, the General Capital  Market Authority plays an essential, decisive role. One of its  main tasks is to adopt all of the necessary means to consolidate  national savings and channel them toward legitimate investment  channels. This requires stimulating the issues market, i.e.,  establishing stock companies and joint stock companies that  issue securities (stocks and bonds). It also requires measures  to induce individuals to invest their savings in these  securities. The authority is also tasked with supervising and  controlling the secondary market, which is the securities  exchange market. It performs this function on the stock exchange  to protect securities transactors.    A strong, regulated securities market with a high degree of  efficiency, transparency, and absorptive capacity must be  created if it is desired to channel national savings into  investment in securities. This is especially essential in view  of the decision to offer for sale, to the public and small  savers, some shares that the public business sector owns in  companies in the governorates or in public-sector companies.  Thus, measures are needed to upgrade the Cairo and Alexandria  stock exchanges and to establish essential financial  organizations. This will strengthen both of these markets'  capacity to absorb the shares of public-sector companies that  will be offered for sale to the public.    It should be noted that disposal through the sale of all or  some of these shares will achieve privatization while allowing  the relevant companies to continue enjoying their status as  legal persons. The disposal will be limited to the transfer of  the ownership of these companies' shares wholly or partially--49  percent or more--to the private sector by offering the shares  for sale on the stock market and through securities brokers or  brokerage companies to be established under the Capital Market  Law No. 95 of 1992 and its implementing regulations.    Justice Mahmud Fahmi concludes by saying that the  liberalization of Egypt's economy and economic reform--through  the use of a multiplicity of tools, whether legislative or the  improvement of the legal frameworks in which investment projects  of the private sector, investment sector, or public business  sector operate--cannot succeed in improving national economic  performance as hoped, unless they are accompanied by the  strengthening of the capital market in its broad sense, i.e., in  its capacity as a money market, capital market, and a securities  market.    Therefore, the government initiated measures to improve the  performance of the money market and the capital market, and it  issued Law No. 95 of 1992 on 22 June 1992.  <H5>  Numerous Types of Bonds </H5>   Dr. Hasan 'Abbas Zaki, a former economic minister and the  chairman of the Arab International Banking Corporation, believes  that numerous factors play a role in stimulating the capital  market. These factors relate to making investors aware of the  benefit of investing through securities transactions. They also  related to the securities themselves.    There are more than 20 types of instruments, i.e., stocks  and  bonds, traded in the world's stock markets. There are nominal  shares, fully-paid shares, preference shares, limited-term  capital participation shares, bonds convertible into shares, and  other types of stocks that are traded on international stock  exchanges.  <H5>  Integrated Measures and Policies </H5>   Dr. Hamdi 'Abd-al-'Azim, dean of al-Sadat Administrative  Sciences Academy-Tanta Branch, believes that the stimulation of  the capital market can be accomplished through a package of  policies, which must be integrated. This depends on the  seriousness of economic liberalization policies in terms of  promoting the private sector, granting some advantages and tax  exemptions to securities, liberalizing foreign trade and the  export of basic commodities such as cotton far from compulsory  delivery, reactivating the ready-made goods exchange that  existed in Alexandria before the revolution, reactivating the  future contracts exchange, and developing an international  communications network.    Attention should also be given to predictive studies and  computer programs designed to generate forecasts and  predictions, and to the gradual linkage of the stock market to  international stock markets.    Also, the issuance of modestly valued treasury notes for  purchase by individuals should be expanded, and the number of  moneychanging companies should be increased.</p>

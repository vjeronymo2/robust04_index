			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Reorganised Lex Service achieves sharp improvement THE VOLATILITY in pre-tax profits that can be caused by the new FRS 3 accounting standard was highlighted by Lex Service's results yester-day. Under the new standard, the motor group turned a pre-tax loss of Pounds 50.1m in 1991 into a profit of Pounds 107m last year. The big swing factors, giving a Pounds 63.7m profit, were the disposal (at a goodwill-impacted loss) of electronics interests and the ending (for a large amount of compensation) of its exclusive import agreement with Volvo. Earnings per share came out at 96.7p compared with losses of 57.4p. Under the old rules, with those transactions taken as extraordinary items, pre-tax profits advanced from Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 28.3m. Earnings were 30.2p (0.4p). The main FRS 3 neutral figures were turnover, Pounds 910.7m (Pounds 1.32bn), and the proposed increased final dividend of 6.6p (6p) to give a 10.6p (10p) total. The share price gained 16p to close at 335p. Lex also signalled its ambitions by announcing the Pounds 13m purchase of 62 Autocentre servicing garages from Lucas Industries. Sir Trevor Chinn, chairman and chief executive, said the group's other targets included increasing the car dealership network from 90 to 120 sites and doubling the size of the contract hire fleet to 100,000. Lex's continuing motor retail business nearly doubled its trading profit (before Pounds 6.7m of group overheads) to Pounds 12.4m with the help of about Pounds 2m from Swan National, bought from the TSB Group last May. Leasing companies, all joint ventures with Lombard North Central - part of National Westminster Bank, contributed Pounds 9.6m to pre-tax profit as associates. Lex Vehicle Leasing turned from a Pounds 3.6m loss to a Pounds 6.5m profit, benefiting from rationalisation and lower interest charges. Truck leasing was also turned round and the forklift trucks side showed strong growth. Lex retains a 17.5 per cent stake in Arrow Electronics of the US. This contributed Pounds 9.5m. The market value of the stake rose to Pounds 94m compared with a book value of Pounds 37m. Net debt fell from Pounds 56.9m to Pounds 8.7m. Lex's half share of off balance sheet debt in the leasing companies amounted to about Pounds 200m. COMMENT Lex now claims to have the biggest UK dealership network, overtaking Inchcape and Octav Botnar's AFG. Yet a swathe of ambitions lie ahead of it, including the service chain started with the latest buy. Its aims on the dealership/leasing fronts echo those of T Cowie and they may be bumping up against each other as they scan the motor activities of much larger groups. Continued recovery in all parts of Lex's business, which hit bottom in 1991 when the dividend was cut, should more than compensate for losing the residue of the Volvo import profits. A pre-tax profit of Pounds 34m (assuming no lumpy deals) gives a prospective p/e of about 14. After outperforming the market by a third in the past six months, most of the good news is in the price.</p>

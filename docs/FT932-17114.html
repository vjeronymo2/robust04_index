			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / M0 growth expected THE TOTAL of UK bank notes in circulation grew at an accelerating pace last month, suggesting continuing expansion of retail turnover and adding to signs that Britain is moving out of recession, Peter Norman writes. The Bank of England reported yesterday that the value of notes in circulation rose by 5.3 per cent in the week to March 31 compared with the equivalent week a year ago. City analysts said the latest weekly increase suggested that M0, the narrow measure of money supply comprising mainly notes and coins in circulation, grew by about 5 per cent in the year to March compared with 4.5 per cent in the year to February. The Bank will release provisional M0 figures for March on Monday. M0 is therefore likely to be growing well above the 0 to 4 per cent monitoring range announced by the chancellor in the Budget last month.</p>

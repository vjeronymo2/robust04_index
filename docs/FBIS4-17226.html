			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Serhiy Rakhmanin: "Esteemed Voters, Are You </F> Ready for a Communist President?"]    [Excerpts] The forum of the Socialist Party of Ukraine  [SPU], which was held on 16 April in Kiev, was supposed to be a  conference. As it turned out, however, the delegates ended up  turning the meeting into the fourth extraordinary congress; this  was the only way they could nominate their candidate for  president. From the very beginning, the candidacy of Aleksandr  Moroz did not raise any doubts. The SPU leader is, of course,  one of the most influential politicians in the state and the  most authoritative person in the party. [passage omitted]    Active work with youth, raising the status of the SPU  newspaper TOVARISHCH, stepping up organizational work, and  looking for sponsors were listed among the current and most  urgent goals of the party. In the opinion of A. Moroz, it was  due to the lack of organizational work and finances that only a  few SPU members became Supreme Council deputies.    Many of the deputies, who delivered reports at this  congress,  also spoke of the need to work on creating a party image, which  remains far too vague: An ordinary person on the street is  hardly likely to be able to intelligently answer a question  regarding differences between the SPU and the Communist Party of  Ukraine [KPU]. The delegates discussed the issue of holding  theoretical conferences under the SPU umbrella, as well as the  need to establish closer contacts with the mass media  (especially going into the elections). An opinion was  formulated that the Socialists should use the tactics of  social-democrats, which could help increase their membership.  [passage omitted]    KPU representatives gathered at their plenum on the same day  in Kiev to discuss KPU participation in the presidential  elections. According to the wish of party lawyers, the plenum  was transformed into a conference: In the opinion of KPU  lawyers, this made the KPU a subject of the upcoming elections.  As one of the KPU leaders, Yriy Solomatin said, there were many  deputies (out of some 350 deputies) who opposed party  participation in the election campaign. According to KPU  platform documents, the existence of presidential power in our  state is ill-advised. After a lively discussion, a decision was  adopted to draft a statement declaring that the KPU will  continue to regard the presidency in our state as not compatible  with the national mentality, however, KPU will participate in  the elections nonetheless because the voting will take place  irrespective of the Communists' attitude toward them. According  to Yu. Solomatin, "given the current sociopolitical situation,"  the KPU has to participate in the election campaign. The KPU  will use this campaign to propagate its ideas. [passage omitted]    As a result, the conference decided to nominate its leader,  Petr Simonenko, as a candidate for president. Petr Simonenko,  who already knew that the SPU congress had nominated Aleksandr  Moroz as a candidate, proposed that his party colleagues support  Moroz's candidacy. However, the KPU did not alter its decision.  [passage omitted]</p>

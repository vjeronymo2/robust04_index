			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOKES -- AND CLIOS -- ARE ON ORKIN RADIO RANCH  </P> <P> Dick Orkin must be laughing all the way home from the Clio Awards.  </P> <P> After all, Dick Orkin's Radio Ranch, the Los Angeles production company whose  radio ads are woven with wall-to-wall jokes, walked off Friday with six Clio  Awards, all for different clients. The awards, among the most coveted prizes in  advertising, are judged by industry professionals.  </P> <P> One of Orkin's awards was for that familiar V-8 juice radio ad in which a  future father-in-law hooks up his future son-in-law to a lie detector to see if  the young man drinks V-8 juice. Another winning ad, for AT&amp;T cordless  phones, features a man sitting in a hot tub with his girlfriend while talking  on the phone to his suspicious aunt.  </P> <P> "Humorous advertising cuts through the clutter," said Orkin, whose company has  won about 80 Clios during the past 20 years.  </P> <P> "It's a more human way to sell products in a very cluttered marketplace," Orkin  said in a telephone interview from New York, where he was attending the  ceremony. Clios for the best television commercials of the past year are  scheduled to be presented Monday evening.  </P> <P> Orkin said the Clios are often more important to clients than to the ad  agencies or production companies that enter the ads. "Clients like to know that  something they've spent a lot of money on has won awards," Orkin said.  </P> <P> In that event, many clients went away disappointed. Although more than 3,000  ads were entered, only 33 awards were handed out.  </P> <P> For the second consecutive year, the Motel 6 ad campaign walked off with a  major honor, this time, best national campaign. The ads, created by Dallas ad  agency the Richards Group, feature folksy Tom ("We'll Leave the Light on For  You") Bodett as spokesman.  </P> <P> Until last year, the Bodett ads were part of a regional campaign aired  primarily in California. But the ads helped generate so much new business that  the company decided to use a portion of those added revenues to take the  campaign national, said Hugh Thrasher, marketing director of Motel 6.  </P> <P> Bodett is under exclusive contract to Motel 6 for two more years, Thrasher  said. And Bodett's success with Motel 6 recently led the resident of Homer,  Alaska, to start his own syndicated radio show, "End of the Road Review."  Naturally, Motel 6 is a sponsor of that show.  </P> <P> In one of Bodett's current ad campaigns, he even sings the Motel 6 room  reservations phone number. "Obviously," gibed Thrasher, "you don't have to hire  the Boston Symphony to win awards." BRUCE HOROVITZ  </P></p>

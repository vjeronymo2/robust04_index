			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: German states agree on 'mad cow' ban Germany's 16 states had agreed to ban slaughter of cattle imported from the UK that might be infected with 'mad cow disease', the agriculture ministry said yesterday, reports Reuter from Bonn. An official said state veterinary authorities had agreed on a package of measures that several states began taking last week against bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Besides the slaughter ban, measures include observation and veterinary checks on suspect herds. Cattle of UK origin can only be sold by official permission.</p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Into the valley of dearth: The British army in Bosnia Welcome to the Wild West. This comes from Sinisha, interpreter and guide. Then his grin widens. He has a better thought. Welcome to Disneyland. The road north into the mountains of Bosnia goes through some of the wildest country in Europe. But it also takes you far into the realm of the surreal. Anybody unaware that they were skirting a war zone would find out at Tomislavgrad, which lies in a bowl of farm country. In Tito's Yugoslavia it was called Duvno, but now has its old Croat name back. It is crawling with the HVO, the Bosnian Croat army holding this front against the Bosnian Serbs. The patrol station is barricaded with sandbags. There is no diesel. The town is a staging post and logistics base for the British army, now moving armoured vehicles up north to protect aid convoys on behalf of the United Nations. The operation involves more logistics personnel - about 1,000, plus 400 engineers on temporary assignment - than fighting soldiers. 'The locals are amazed by this stuff. They ask why we need all this kit. And we're not here to fight a war,' an officer says. The Brits have rechristened the town Tommygrad. Carefully laid plans of the British Army of the Rhine have been transplanted here. So has the menu outside the cookhouse tent: Pork snitzels mit sauce. They are still waiting for beds and wardrobes to arrive from Split on the Croatian coast. They have ironing boards, but no irons yet. The warning sirens went off in town the other day. It is within artillery range of Serb positions. The British rely on the HVO to keep them up to date. One HVO battalion here is commanded by an Australian, the other by a German-Canadian. From recent movements it is assumed 'they're up to something'. Further up the road is a village, Rascane, where several hundred local Serbs were installed, under guard, after being collected from the town and surrounding area some months ago. Steering away from the battle lines, which make it impossible to join the main road, the route soon breaks off into a wet muddy track. The Land Rover, courtesy of BBC Radio, comes into its own. This has become known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail. It is pegged all along the way with the arcane symbols used on British army route markings. The road winds up into pine forests, over barren stony heathland and back into wooded mountains broken by cliffs. Royal Engineers have been working fast to create passing places and much of the track has been widened. But the traffic is heavy: old lorries carrying timber or livestock, improvised petrol tankers, consignments from Islamic aid organisations, coaches. Above a glorious valley we hit a stupendous traffic jam. After 40 minutes another convoy suddenly appears in the distance, a sight as chilling as a line of Apache braves appearing on the ridge. Back on a brief stretch of tarmac we pass through the gutted town of Prozor, scene of a flare-up two weeks ago between Croats and Moslems. House-fronts have been smashed or shot up, some houses burnt. A jeep is marked with the initials of the Croat neo-fascist HOS organisation. After Gornji Vakuf, the checkpoint is for the first time manned by Moslem rather than Croat soldiers, smoking and dangling their Kalashnikov look-alike rifles. Checkpoints are mostly less of a hazard on the route than bulldozers, sheep and pack donkeys. But one encountered later on in the dark requires driving around the land mines. 'Vitez? I wouldn't go there. Kate Adie's there,' a sergeant-major had said at Tomislavgrad. The presence of the high-profile BBC television reporter is to the army something like a royal visit. It is also another major logistics exercise. After more rough track through a ravine, the approach to Vitez, which lies on an arterial road west of Sarajevo, appears tame and civilised, strung with respectable family homes. From Split we are 75 miles away as the crow flies. The journey has taken 7 1/2 hours. The British have rented a 1970s-style school here as battalion headquarters. The bulk of the 800 troops to be stationed here is arriving over the next few days. Most will have to live at the start in tents. A few tents have just blown down in a rain squall. A big bang shakes the school windows. It turns out to have been an HVO 205mm howitzer fired from near the church. Later on, in the early morning, bursts of automatic weapon fire can be heard in the distance. The Cheshire Regiment has brought with it a small selection of regimental silver to brighten up the room used as the officers' mess. There are also framed copies of some of its pictures. One in the corridor commemorates the Sind campaign of 1843. In some respects, for all the high technology of modern soldiering, Vitez is no less remote. They have just managed to get proper cups for tea. But British newspapers arrive three days late.</p>

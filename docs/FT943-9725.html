			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Plan for driving licence photograph Government plans to include a photograph of the holder on each driving licence will be disclosed today. An official said: 'The Department of Transport will issue a consultative paper and its subject is the re-design of the driving licence - and in particular the identification through photographic reproduction.' Among possible options is a credit card-sized licence which could store information, could be read by a computer and would carry a photograph.</p>

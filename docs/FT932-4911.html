			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Letter: High cost of Czech currency exchange Sir, Mr Vladimir Dlouhy should look internally if Czech economic recovery is not to be stifled by unfair trading conditions (Letters, June 2). The recent addition of little stamps in the corner of common currency notes to differentiate them in the Czech Republic and Slovakia has ensured that Czech notes are not accepted in Slovakia and vice versa. Hotels will 'exchange' notes at 83 per cent of face value, plus 2 per cent handling charge, and banks at 88 per cent, plus 2 per cent. Consequently, on my recent journey from Frenstat (N Moravia) to Smokovec (Slovakia) and return to Brno (S Moravia) my Czech-Slovak currency lost 26 per cent at bank rates and 34 per cent at hotel rates. These penal exchange rates and non-acceptance of each other's currency was not notified by Cedok, the common tourist agency. I urge Mr Dlouhy to review this monetary policy if the tourist trade is not to be stifled. Paul Ashmore, Ashmore &amp; Jones, 6 Kingston Terrace, Eastgate, Sleaford, Lincs NG34 7DY</p>

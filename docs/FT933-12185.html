			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Battle is waged in 'local' Derby: The review of local government structure itself faces radical revision after fierce controversy. FT reporters examine the issues THE LOCAL Government Commission knew its suggestion of two unitary authorities for Derbyshire would be open to criticism. Its recommendation, one of four options it considered for the shape of local government in the county, is 'the least satisfactory in terms of community identity', it acknowledged. It tried to buttress its choice by advocating devolved management of services to the community level, and to build on what it called local centres of identity 'an enhanced role for town and parish councils'. The district councils emphasise community identity as they strain to make the case for their own survival intact or - failing that - merged with a neighbour. But even as they manoeuvre to break down the commission proposal of just one authority outside the city of Derby, their own position in deferring to local community identity may be just as weak as that of the commission. Earlier this year MORI, the research organisation, found that Derbyshire residents expressed a strong sense of attachment to their local neighbourhood (in urban areas) or village (in rural parts of the county). Identification with district areas was less pronounced, with the exception of the strong attachment expressed towards Chesterfield, and identification with the county less pronounced again. But MORI also reported that, as a factor determining the shape of local government, a sense of local community was deemed important only by 3 per cent of the sample. By far the most important factor was that the structure should respond to the wishes of local people, followed by the cost and quality of services.</p>

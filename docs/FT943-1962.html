			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (10): Overseas investors wooed - A look at problems in Japan As Japan's large institutional investors show increasing reluctance to take on new equity, the country's leading companies have started to look to overseas investors for funding. Hence, it was no surprise when Japan Telecom, which was listed earlier this month along with an offering of 34,000 shares, or 10 per cent in the company, wooed international investors by offering 5,000 shares for the international market. The issue was the first initial public offering ever to involve a separate international tranche. Japan Telecom officials say they want more acknowledgement among international investors to make future fundraising on global financial markets easier. But some analysts fear that the decline in Telecom's share price since its listing, leaving investors sitting on losses, may hurt such prospects. Foreign investors have become increasingly wary of buying new Japanese equity. Some analysts say Japan Telecom's listing has highlighted problems in Japan's pricing system for public offerings. Established after the Recruit stocks-for-favours scandal in the late 1980s, the current system attempts to prevent corruption by determining the offering price through an auction. The difference between the Japanese system and the bookbuilding process used in most international equity issues is that the price is set near the start of the offering period rather than towards the end. The wider the gap between pricing and trading, the more the share price is vulnerable to wider market movements. The issue needs to be resolved soon, especially since foreign investors have become more important to Japanese companies than ever before. According to the Ministry of Finance, net purchases of Japanese stocks by overseas investors totalled a record Dollars 46.7bn during the year ended March, an eight-fold rise over the previous year. An increasingly number of Japanese companies have already taken advantage of demand among international investors. In June, Amway Japan, the Japanese arm of the US home care products group, offered its shares through the first global offering in two years. Other companies have set up internal investor relations groups in order to enhance their images as investor-friendly organisations. Meanwhile, large companies have started to list on overseas markets so as to raise their profiles in the international financial community. Although such moves were common during the late 1980s when the Japanese stock market showed few signs of rising, since the stock market plunge in 1990, listings on overseas markets have been restrained because of the fall in profits among Japanese companies and the negative image of falling stock prices. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the leading telecommunications operator, announced in July that it would list on the London and New York stock exchanges to raise its profile among the global financial community. 'By listing in the US, where disclosure rules are stricter than in Japan, we hope to win trust from investors,' say company officials. Smaller Japanese companies are also trying to increase their appeal to international investors. Small ventures in Japan have had a hard time raising funds through the domestic equity market due to stringent listing requirements. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which overlooks start-up companies, is now encouraging companies to look overseas to diversify their funding options. For instance, Biomaterial, a bio-technology company based in western Japan, recently announced plans to apply for the US Nasdaq exchange. If it lists on the exchange in 1996 as planned, it will be the first Japanese company to bypass the domestic stock markets for a listing on an overseas stock exchange. To list on the Japanese over-the-counter exchange, a company is required to post Y10 or more in earnings per share and to have net assets of Y200m or more. It is a chicken-and-egg situation for many start-up companies since without strong earnings they cannot apply for a listing, but without a listing they cannot raise funds to expand their operations. The prospect of the equity offerings business in Japanese companies increasingly flowing outside the country is causing anxiety among Japanese brokers, who fear they may lose business to foreign investment houses which have stronger ties with overseas investors. In Japan, the media have dubbed the phenomenon 'part of the financial hollowing out process', whereby fundraising and secondary trading in the Japanese financial markets flow out to overseas markets due to Tokyo's numerous regulations, high costs and business practices which are not in line with international standards. The sentiment that the Tokyo stock market is not the place to be is shared by many foreign companies, which have withdrawn their listings from the Tokyo stock exchange's foreign division. This year, 13 foreign companies, including Eastman Kodak, the US photo film maker, have delisted from the TSE, reducing the number of companies listed on the foreign section to 96 companies, sharply lower than the 127 at the peak in 1991. The high costs of maintaining a listing and the lack of trading volume in the secondary market have been cited by companies which have moved out. Officials at foreign companies claim the promotional value as well as fund procurement benefits of the exchange's foreign section are virtually non-existent. In spite of worries over 'hollowing out' aired by the local financial community, including domestic brokers, the country's finance ministry officials remain complacent over the threat that the Japanese financial markets might decline into oblivion. They maintain that backed by Japan's high savings ratio and large current account surplus, the country's institutional investors retain as much financial power as ever. The reality is, however, that domestic institutional investors have not recovered from the shock of the stock market plunge in the early 1990s and remain cautious about equity investments. Unless they overcome fears of taking risks, Japanese companies will continue to turn to overseas markets and investors for funds.</p>

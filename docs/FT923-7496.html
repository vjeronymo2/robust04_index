			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Bush under pressure in oilseeds row AS THE US-EC dispute over oilseeds moves towards a climax, the Bush administration is being pressed by farm organisations and Capitol Hill to make the oilseeds dispute a test of the effectiveness of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. . Today is the end of the 60-day period for compensation talks under Gatt. Brussels made a number of offers, including proposals to raise quotas for beef imports and to increase access for imported maize. These have all been rejected as insufficient and providing little for the injured party - the oilseeds producers. However, according to one US farm group official, there was 'progress of sorts' when the EC withdrew a threat to impose a tariff rate quota on oilseeds. It remains possible that even today, the US could release its retaliatory 'hit list' which would put tariffs of as much as 400 per cent on trade worth Dollars 1bn. The list, thought to be the largest US sanctions package on record, will have been whittled down from a list valued at more than Dollars 2bn. Although the 60-day period is expiring, it could be some days before a final sanctions roster is released, because the farm experts at the US Trade Representative's office have been preoccupied with the North American Free Trade talks. Mrs Carla Hills, the US Trade Representative, is in Houston at the Republican Convention. Ms Nancy Foster, of the American Soyabean Association, which brought the complaint, said: 'We are recommending that the admin-istration show a strong signal of resolve on this issue.' In an election year, with the Mid-West an expected battleground, that recommendation is not likely to be ignored. Senators supporting the soyabean lobby in discussions with administration officials are making the issue 'a litmus test for the value of a new Gatt agreement,' Ms Foster said. 'If we follow the procedures, win a case twice and still not get redress, what is the point?' The negotiations in Brussels have gone beyond the US and the Community to encompass all oilseeds exporting countries claiming damages from the EC failure to eliminate subsidies to its oilseeds sector. The compensation talks include Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Hungary, Poland, Pakistan, India and Sweden. So far, the group has been united in holding out for a better compensation package. While the farm groups have been urging a tough line on the administration, US business has been scurrying to keep the food, wine, spirits and flowers it imports off the final sanctions list. If it comes to retaliation, the damage will be painful on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

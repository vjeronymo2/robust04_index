			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: BM sale continues restructure programme BM Group, the debt-laden engineering company, has continued its restructuring with the sale of certain trading assets of Blackwood Hodge (Canada), its construction equipment distributor, for CDollars 6m (Pounds 3m). The sale, to Toronto-based Strong Corporation, comprises the business, stock and certain properties of BHC in Quebec and the Maritime Provinces. The disposal was part of a programme currently underway which is expected to fetch about Pounds 40m and eliminate roughly Pounds 24m in associated debt. It follows an earlier sale of 14 businesses for Pounds 51m. Buyers for the remainder of the Canadian assets of Blackwood Hodge are being sought, although BM refused to disclose their value for commercial reasons. BM acquired Blackwood Hodge's worldwide business for Pounds 54m in 1990. Last month BM reported a swing from profits of Pounds 34.6m to losses of Pounds 116.6m pre-tax for the year to June 30 after taking account of higher-than-expected restructuring provisions and write-downs.</p>

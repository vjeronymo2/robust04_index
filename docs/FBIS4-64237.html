			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Anabel Diez and Luis R. Aizpeolea: "PSOE </F> Leadership Insists Solchaga Does Not Have To Resign Yet"]    [Excerpt] Madrid - The scandals surrounding Mariano Rubio  and Luis Roldan will not at the moment lead to resignations in  the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party]. At the current  state of the investigation, the party leadership does not  consider there to be any political liability attached to former  ministers Carlos Solchaga and Jose Luis Corcuera, during whose  terms the irregularities were committed. This prevailing view  in the Socialist executive was revealed at Monday's [25 April]  meeting and confirmed in the course of the week. However,  Secretary General Felipe Gonzalez has yet to make a statement:  Everyone hopes he will do so today at the Federal Committee  meeting convened to approve the electoral lists.

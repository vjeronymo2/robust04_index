			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lise Tajik: "EU Fund Closed to Small Projects in </F> the Baltics"]    [Text] The EU [European Union] fund for small and minor  business projects in the Baltics has been depleted. The money  has been spent on the creation of advisory centers, and new  funds will not be appropriated until the middle of 1995.    There will be no new initiatives financed by the EU in the  three Baltic countries for a year and a half.    The EU fund in support of small and medium-sized enterprises  (SME) in the Baltics has been completely depleted, and no more  funds from this particular section of the PHARE [Economic  Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] program will become  available until the middle of 1995.    The money has been swallowed up in the establishment of  business advisory centers in the three Baltic countries, and  there is not a red cent left for more down-to-earth programs.  <H5>  Procedure Results in Problems </H5>   The Council of Artisans welcomes the idea of advisory  centers, but finds it alarming that the EU fund for SME has been  depleted.    However, it is not only the missing millions that the  Council  finds disturbing. Another problem is PHARE's very bureaucratic  appropriation process.    Only projects that the receiving countries themselves apply  for are given support. This benefits only government interests  in the Baltics to the detriment of private projects, among  others those enterprise-to-enterprise programs, on which the  future business structure in the three Baltic countries has been  based.    Another difficulty is the fact that, after revising the  Danish support arrangements for East Europe, one stresses the  importance of linking these to international sources of  investment.    In this way, small and medium-sized enterprises have been  let  go because they do not have a chance in the world of competing  with the big ones in getting their share of international funds.  <H5>  Large Grant to Poland </H5>   The PHARE program has set aside ECU230 million between 1990  and 1992 for development of small and medium-sized enterprises  in East and Central Europe. Of this, only ECU9 million have gone  to the three Baltic countries -- corresponding to 3.75 percent  of the total amount -- while about 40 percent -- ECU9 million  has been spent on SME projects in Poland.    The total PHARE program for East and Central Europe was  granted ECU1 billion (almost 8 billion kroner) in 1993, and a  similar amount has been set aside for 1994. The PHARE  appropriations, consisting of a combination of professional aid  and financial support, is spent on:    --Changeover and privatization of government businesses.    --Support for the private sector, especially small  businesses.%Modernizing of financial systems.    --Development of a social safety net.</p>

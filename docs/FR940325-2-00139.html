The hospital defendants agreed to exchange prospective and current compensation information. The conspiracy had the effect of depriving registered nurses in Salt Lake County and elsewhere in Utah of the benefits of free and open competition in the purchase of registered nursing services. In addition, the conspiracy resulted in smaller annual increases in the registered-nurse entry wage than the hospital defendants would have paid absent the conspiracy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Complaint seeks to prevent the defendants from continuing or renewing the alleged conspiracy, or from engaging in any other conspiracy, or adopting any practice having a similar purpose of effect for a period of 5 years. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Ruling boosts compensation prospects for Names The prospects of Lloyd's Names winning further compensation for losses suffered in the insurance market in the 1980s were yesterday enhanced after the House of Lords ruled that claims could be brought under the law of tort. Five law lords ruled that Names could bring actions under tort law, which allows for damages claims not related to alleged breaches of contract. The ruling clears the way for Names to bring more actions seeking compensation, since under tort law claims can be made up to 12 years from the date when the alleged damage was discovered. Claims for breach of contract have to be started within six years of the action complained of. Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, said it would start proceedings against Littlejohn Frazer, the former Gooda Walker auditors. The action to claim more than Pounds 100m compensation would centre on the use of 'time and distance' policies by Gooda Walker's syndicate 290, he said. The House of Lords also upheld a Court of Appeal ruling that members' agents were liable for the negligence of managing agents - a decision which confirms the ability of Names to claim compensation from the 'error and omission' insurance policies held by the members' agents. The E&amp;O cover arranged by the members' agents totals about Pounds 1.1bn. The Gooda Walker High Court case resumed yesterday with the start of closing submissions. Mr Geoffrey Vos QC, for more than 3,000 Gooda Walker Names who are suing the agency for more than Pounds 600m, said the agency's underwriters had 'thrown away the rule book' and carried out their work in an ad hoc, almost reckless manner. During the hearing the judge, Mr Justice Phillips, said he had 'a lot of sympathy' with the views on excess loss insurance expressed by Mr Ulrich von Eicken, a former Munich Re executive who appeared as an expert witness for the Names. Mr Von Eicken had said that writing excess loss on excess loss business  - a practice carried out by Gooda Walker - was an aberration since it could not be properly rated. Submissions will end this week. The judgment is expected in September.</p>

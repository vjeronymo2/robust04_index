			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Gilts It is hard to find any immediate justification for Mrs Thatcher's alarm over the state of government finances. True, the PSBR will double to Pounds 28bn this year, but the gilts market barely flinched at yesterday's Pounds 2.5bn auction announcement. With that money secured, the Bank of England already has some Pounds 8bn in the bag. So strong, it seems, is the demand for gilts since the election that the PSBR appears disappointingly small. Since a large part of the demand for UK government paper comes from abroad, that also implies little immediate grounds for alarm about the current account deficit. The Bank's decision to make the auction issue free of tax to non-residents suggests it perceives overseas demand even for the longest-dated gilts. If non-residents buy only half the Pounds 30bn in gilts expected to come on offer this year, they would produce a capital inflow sufficient to cover the government's estimated current account deficit more than twice. Indeed, far from being a threat to recovery, the rising trade deficit could be dismissed as a natural corollary to the capital inflow. It is only because such a situation is not sustainable in the long term that Mrs Thatcher's strictures make sense. In the early 1980s the US happily managed to run large deficits on its government and current account thanks to inflows of foreign money into the Treasury bond market. The difference between that situation and the UK today is that, when foreign investors became sated, the US was at least able to tackle its trade deficit by devaluation. That route would not be open to the UK as a member of the ERM. Though the UK's semi-fixed exchange rate encourages capital inflows, it also means the burden of any eventual adjustment will fall more heavily on government spending: all the more so since a high exchange rate will prevent growth snapping back with any vigour, limiting the cyclical effect of recovery on the PSBR. There are also more immediate reasons why the Bank of England should not get carried away by its funding success since the election. Gross gilt sales will still need to run at a rate of some Pounds 2bn a month for the rest of 1992-93 if the requirement is to be met. Also, Pounds 1.75bn of the auction proceeds will only flow into its coffers in May and June. The partly-paid structure may offer leverage to investors hoping for a further fall in nominal yields, but later issues will hit a market cluttered by sizeable calls on investor cash.</p>

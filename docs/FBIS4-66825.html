			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anita Katyal: "Composition of Rajya Sabha To </F> Change"]    [Text] New Delhi, March 20--When the Rajya Sabha  re-assemblies here on April 18 after a month-long recess, its  composition will have undergone a considerable change with a  large chunk of its 250-odd members having retired and many new  ones replacing them.    Unlike the Lok Sabha where the ruling party has been  progressively adding to its numbers, in the upper house the  treasury benches will shrink in size, no longer commanding the  comfortable position they do at present.    From 106, the Congress strength will come down to 95 while  the main opposition party, the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party],  will have added substantially to its numbers, which will go up  from 33 to 45. Even the Janata Dal, which has been written off  by political pundits, will increase its presence from 27 to 29.    With the Mulayam Singh Yadav-Kanshi Ram combine coming to  power in U.P., [Uttar Pradesh] their respective parties will be  better represented now in the Rajya Sabha. While the Samajwadi  Party's representation will go up from two to five, the Bahujan  Samaj Party (BSP) will be making its debut in the upper house.    Among the losers are the Samajwadi Janata Party (SJP), which  will be losing three of its 11 members while the TDP [Telugu  Desam Party] strength will be depleted from five to three.    The "shouting brigade" of the Congress will now be poorer by  one of its most effective members, Mr Vishvajit Prithvijit  Singh, who was equally capable of solid argument when the  occasion demanded. It will probably gain from the return of the  former Bihar chief minister, Dr Jagannath Mishra, who also  enjoys the reputation of being a voluble parliamentarian.    The party's doughty fighter, Mrs Satyabehin, will also not  be  returning next month just as Mr M.C. Bhandare, whose legal  acumen is bound to be missed by the ruling party.    The party seniors who will be gracing the treasury benches,  include Mr V.N. Gadgil, who is coming back to the upper house  after a gap of 18 years, Mr Janardhan Poojary, Mr Madhavsinh  Solanki and Mr Jitender Prasad, political secretary to the  Congress president, who comes to the Rajya Sabha for the first  time as he has been a member of the other House till now.    Mr Solanki's return, of course, is contingent on the ongoing  leadership battle being waged in Gujarat. Should Mr Solanki  succeed in "capturing" the chief minister's post he will have to  vacate his seat in the upper house.    Another Congress leader, who is coming back after a gap, is  Mr Ramji Lal, who had vacated his seat at the party high  command's behest to make way for Mr Dinesh Singh. Mr Lal has  been elected from Harayana in place of Mr Mohinder Singh Lather,  Mr Devi Lal's relation, whose exit means the severing of the  Tau's last link with this house.    Among those who have been reelected are Mr Suresh Kalmadi,  Ms  Saroj Kharpade, Mr Sitaram Kesari, Mr Bhuvnesh Chaturvedi and Mr  Hansraj Bhardwaj, who has managed to survive despite Mr T.N.  Seshan's efforts to do him out of his seat.    The opposition ranks in the Rajya Sabha might have been  steadily swelling but this increase in numbers has been more  than offset by the loss of effective speakers like Mr Kamal  Morarka of the SJP. As the Janata Dal leader, Mr S. Jaipal  Reddy, rightly put it in his farewell speech, Mr Morarka scaled  great oratorial heights and was undoubtedly one of the ablest  parliamentarians, who had the knack of coming to the root of a  problem without resorting to rhetoric.    Mr Morarka's loss will be doubly felt by the opposition as  it  had already lost an effective speaker and fighter in Mr Yashwant  Sinha, who resigned his seat when he snapped ties with the SJP  and joined the BJP last November.    Similarly, the maverick politician, Dr Subramaniam Swamy,  always a delight to listen to irrespective of whether one agreed  with his brand of politics, will leave a vacuum which will not  be easy to fill. His retirement, however, will be quite a relief  to the AIADMK [All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam] members  at least, considering Dr Swamy's penchant for raising  uncomfortable questions regarding Tamil Nadu and its chief  minister.    However, the opposition will find itself fortified by the  fiery presence of the first-timer, Ms Mayawati of the BSP, who  has already become a controversial figure because of her  unsavoury remarks about the Father of the Nation.    Considering her track record in the Lok Sabha, Ms Mayawati,  known for her intemperate and colourful language, is set to make  waves in the upper house.    Film star-turned-politician, Mr Raj Babbar, will be taking a  bow on the country's political stage, having been elected by the  SP [Superintendent of Police].    Ironically, he will find himself face-to-face with his  father-in-law, Mr Shivaji Patil (Smita Patil's father).</p>

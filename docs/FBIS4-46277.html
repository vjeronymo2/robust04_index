			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Dear listeners: One of the duties of the peshmerga  force is to punish traitors and criminals. Throughout its  period of activity, the peshmerga force has carried out many  such operations, and especially recently we have heard many  reports on the punishment and the revolutionary execution of  traitors broadcast on the Voice of Iranian Kordestan [VOIK].    Naturally the punishment of the traitors and of those who  serve the regime and commit crimes against the people and the  peshmerga force is an aspect of armed struggle. Of course the  peshmerga force both kills and is killed through its armed  struggle against a powerful and armed enemy because armed  struggle is a matter of life or death and anyone who is armed  will be killed if he does not kill the enemy himself.    Moreover as in most countries of the world, punishment for  traitors and for those who harm the interests of their nation  and of their homeland, and who work against the interests of  their people and their land is execution, unless we are talking  about countries where capital punishment has been banned and  replaced by life imprisonment. Of course this is meaningless  under the current conditions in Kordestan during a violent and  bloody armed struggle.    Thus, there is no doubt that traitors and criminals should  be  punished as persistently and as harshly as possible. As stated  above this is basically one of the duties of the peshmerga force  in its struggle. However there are some important points which  should be considered when carrying out this duty; and although  we are sure that the party committees and the party's  revolutionary peshmerga force always has these points and many  others in mind, we deem it necessary to re-emphasize them.    The most important point to underline is that when punishing  people, the objective is not revenge. Killing and executing  constitute only one method of punishment and should be used as a  last resort. This means that when punishing culprits, execution  should only be carried out if all other methods have proven to  be ineffective or when the treachery is so great that the only  punishment is execution.    We have repeatedly said that during an armed struggle,  resorting to execution may be the simplest thing to do.  However, the simplest thing is not always the best thing. If  we want to comment more precisely on the way that traitors  should be executed, we believe that we should start from the  beginning to reach the last phase which is execution.    First and foremost, when speaking about the punishment of a  traitor it should first be proven that person has actually  committed treason. Treason is a serious accusation, and as  previously pointed out, even warrants punishment by execution.  Therefore, such an accusation should not be made lightly  against someone, and someone should not be branded a traitor  merely on the basis of allegations by a couple of people or on  the basis of reports by some. In order to determine the extent  of the crime committed by someone, precise and detailed  investigations should be carried out and incontestable documents  should exist. During the investigations, the (?type) of treason  should be clarified since treason has varying degrees. This  means that each type of treason does not warrant punishment by  execution and that in many cases the type or degree of treason  may call for less severe punishment.    Treason committed by someone who reports on the location of  the peshmerga force but whose act does not harm the peshmerga in  any way is different from treason that is committed by someone  who leads one or several peshmerga to martyrdom, or from treason  committed by someone who has participated in the war against the  peshmerga and whose hands are stained with the blood of the  peshmerga. Such degrees of treason should be punished  accordingly.    Another point is, as stated above, that execution is the  last  resort. This is why death sentences should be issued only when  all other ways to punish, or ways to make a misled person repent  have been exhausted. For example, informing and showing the  right way to someone who has been caught in the web of treason  is undoubtedly the first, and most necessary, step to be taken.  A misled person can be shown the right path through the party  mechanisms and by the peshmerga force directly or indirectly  through encouragement of friends, relatives, acquaintances, and  neighbors. When all these methods prove ineffective, he should  then be warned and threatened.    In addition to all this, the decision on executing a traitor  is a collective decision which should be adopted through  consultations and not individually. In other words, when all  said points are observed, when all the phases referred to above  have been completed, and when things reach a point where someone  has to be executed, a decision on this should be discussed at  the party committee and all its aspects be analyzed and  examined. It is only then that orders to carry out the  execution should be given to the peshmerga force.    It should be said that the party committees in the various  parts of Kordestan have the authority and competence to execute  traitors and criminals. However, it should be noted that only  the committee or, at least, three high-ranking officials of the  party have this authority and competence and none of the party  members have this authority and competence on their own. In  addition, in cases when a decision on such an important issue  should be made, it is better to ask for the opinion of many  others too. And, if possible, the views of a number of the  villagers and especially of some members of the rural council of  the area where the traitor lives should be sought because, as  the adage goes, it is better to be safe than sorry. It is only  in this way that those who issue death sentences can have a  clear conscience.    When the death sentence for a traitor is issued its  execution  is assigned to the peshmerga force. If the traitor is not being  held by the peshmerga and the sentence has been issued in  absentia, the peshmerga force should attempt to arrest him.  However, the peshmerga should try, as best as possible, to hand  over the traitor to the party committee so that he will have the  right to defend himself or have another hearing. Of course this  is not a simple task and involves many problems because the  culprit is in the area which is under the enemy's control and he  may exploit this situation and refuse to surrender to the  peshmerga force and to attempt his self-defense or to cry out to  the enemy for help. In all these cases, there is the  possibility that the lives of the peshmerga are threatened.  This is why we do not consider this duty compulsory, hence our  noting that this is something which the peshmerga should try to  do as best as possible.    The last point which should be noted as far as the execution  of a traitor is concerned is that after the punishment of the  traitor, the people should be clearly informed on the reasons  for this execution and the record of the traitor. As far as the  punishments that have been carried out by the party committees,  we see that this point has been very well observed since reports  on these executions have been sent to the VOIK. This is a  source of happiness.    All the efforts and struggles by any individual or  revolutionary organization are for the people. This is why the  reasons for the behavior of these individuals and organizations  and their political and social stances should be clear for the  people during the struggle so that the people will be able to  understand them and to voluntarily support them. Moreover, the  major objective behind punishments is to teach a lesson to  others; and the execution of a traitor can be a lesson only when  those who are doing more or less what the traitor did can see  what acts the party considers to be treason and punishable by  execution and, in a nutshell, see and understand the  consequences of their acts.    As stated at the beginning of this talk, we believe that the  responsible political people inside the party and among the  ranks of the revolutionary peshmerga will observe these and many  other important points. Reports on some revolutionary  executions that have been received by the VOIK until now prove  this point; and this is a source of pride for us. Thus, we hope  that our few words will make our combatant brothers more alert  and more persistent in carrying out their duties. Do not forget  that the peshmerga force is fighting for human rights and the  members are sacrificing their lives in the process. Thus, they  should not unwillingly commit acts that will trample on the  human rights of an individual or of a group of people.</p>

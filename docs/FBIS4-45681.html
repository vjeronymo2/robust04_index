			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 17 (CTK) -- The absence of mining and  energy laws in the Czech Republic is proof that democracy is  sadly lacking in this country, Jarmila Valcikova writes in the  right- leaning daily CESKY DENIK today.    It follows that the state cannot effectively control its  natural and mineral resources. Strong lobbies after a quick  buck see this country as their promised land, the paper writes.    According to press reports, raw materials, building  materials  -- including sandstone and gravel sand -- and fuels accounted  for over 53 percent of Czech exports in the first nine months of  last year.    These figures provoke anxiety, the paper writes, asking  whether in the future the Czech Republic will have enough  resources to afford to buy such materials on the world market.    There is no pro-export policy to stimulate small businesses  with their potential for clever ideas and so the unscrupulous  pillaging of the land has been going on unchecked.    What is more, there are no legislative guidelines to provide  that the present conditions of early capitalism in the sector  become more like those of developed societies who protect their  natural wealth.    Compared to 1989, stone exports have gone up 90 times. The  Vrsetin hill in the Ceske stredohori mountain range has been all  but flattened. The paper asks whether the whole of Ceske  stredohori is to disappear for some people's profit and if so,  who is going to be responsible.    Ceske stredohori is state property and should not be owned  by  companies. Incidentally, stone is marketed, among others, by  the former agent Pavel Minarik, the paper says, quoting from  Minarik's interview with LIDOVE NOVINY.    Minarik has recently lodged an appeal against a four year  jail sentence handed down last September for his part in  plotting to put Radio Free Europe in Munich out of action in the  1970s.    The project of cement works at Tman, central Bohemia,  endangers a nature preserve of Cesky kras, an area of  underground sandstone caves unique throughout the world.  Already intensive work is going on at railway reloading points  in Vimperk, Volary and Prachatice, all South Bohemia, through  which sandstone passes on its way abroad. This year's cement  export quota amounts to almost two million tonnes. It is not  known how much earth needs to be dug to yield that amount, the  paper says.    Germany prohibits the use of digging mechanisms harmful to  the environment, which is why profit-hungry German businessmen  ship them to this country where their use is unrestricted.  Commenting on Tman, Czech Minister of Trade and Industry  Vladimir Dlouhy has allegedly said that he "never spoke in favor  of the cement works." The hopes these words might incite are  dashed in the light of the recently destroyed village Libkovice,  North Bohemia -- a place, the paper says, that he surrendered to  the coal lobby.    But rather than Germans, district officials at Beroun,  Central Bohemia, administering Tman, employees of the State  Hygiene Authority and local officials at Tman are to blame.    American Indians are said to have once sold land for a few  bottles of whisky, the paper says, adding that delegating too  much authority to towns and villages is courting disaster for  society and nature.    The construction of waterways is yet another example of  profiteering. It may be gravel sand lodged in the river beds  and not actual river transport that companies such as Ecotrans  Moravia and its sister companies are interested in, the paper  speculates. The profitability of river transport is questionable  and the value of property affected by waterway projects is  plummeting. Once they have been completed, the surrounding  environment is eventually reduced to steppes.    However, the law banning projects harmful to the  environment,  pushed through by the Ministry for the Environment, is there for  people to lean on if they want, as they should, to defend their  beautiful country and pass it on to their children, Valcikova  says in CESKY DENIK.</p>

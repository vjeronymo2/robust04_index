			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> DOMESTIC CRISIS FOR A JAMAICAN MOTHER  </P> <P> The agonizing plight of Jamaican immigrants to Canada is the subject of "Milk  and Honey" (at the Fine Arts), a well-intentioned, particularly well-acted film  that falls apart before its midpoint and finishes with soap opera flourishes. A  pity, because its star, Josette Simon, is as much a find as "Mona Lisa's" Cathy  Tyson.  </P> <P> Like Joanna Bell (Simon), many of the women who emigrate have been lured by  promises of comfortable money as nannies and instead find themselves virtual  indentured servants. Joanna has powerful reasons for leaving her small Jamaican  town; a single mother, she doesn't want to see her 6-year-old son, David  (Richard Mills), raised in rural poverty. In a wrenching parting, Joanna leaves  him with her mother, and in one day makes the jump from the tropics to a  Toronto with snowdrifts in the streets.  </P> <P> The cultural differences are almost as severe, and directors Rebecca Yates and  Glen Salzman make those absolutely clear in the first sequences. To Joanna,  this gleaming clean nanny's room with its own bath seems amazing; we may notice  that the heating duct runs right through it, and it seems to be a conduit for  the family's television sound, but this and a salary of $225 each week seems  like heaven.  </P> <P> But her first paycheck, minus all the allowable deductions -- her air fare,  paid off in installments, a pension plan, the $70 per week they charge her for  room and board -- is $20. And, talking to other nannies in the park, she finds  that she's as caught as they all are. Until she gets papers as a "landed  immigrant," which can be years, she is a "foreign domestic," earning a fixed  $126.40 per week and forbidden to do any other kind of work.  </P> <P> And so we skip two years. Joanna, whose hair is now handsomely cropped close to  her head, is still working for the same unfeeling middle-class couple who now  have two babies, and she is savvy, isolated and desperately lonely, her church  her only bulwark. The screenplay, by Trevor Rhone and Salzman, makes  superficial attempts to characterize her other friends: the warm and pious Miss  Emma (Leonie Forbes), bosomy Maureen (Jane Dingle) the Liverpudlian, and the  lively Del (Djanet Sears) clearly heading down the primrose path with her  con-man boyfriend (Errol Slue), known as Mr. Fix-It for his way with  immigration scams.  </P> <P> Joanna has also had an almost-disastrous encounter with a night-school teacher,  Adam Bernardi (Lyman Ward), who makes a clumsy pass at her. All these story  threads will come together when Joanna brings her son, now 8, up for Christmas  holidays, then impulsively, decides she cannot bear to send him back and will  try to keep him in the country illegally.  </P> <P> "Milk and Honey" may be a bit flat-footed and didactic in its opening; at least  that section tracks and the material is interesting. By the second half,  contrivance is all, and it feels as though gaping chunks had been left out,  particularly in the relationship between Joanna and Adam, who resurfaces as  principal of the school in which she registers the truant David.  </P> <P> It goes now from drama to melodrama to semi-love story to seeming tragedy with  an atrocious upbeat ending in Jamaica that solves nothing and makes you wonder  for the sanity of the people involved. Salvageable are the performances of  Djanet Sears as the unexpectedly malevolent Del, and Ward, whom you may  remember as the sought-after senior executive fox-trotting his way to success  in "Ray's Male Heterosexual Dance Hall." And, of course Simon, a member of  London's Royal Shakespeare Company, who will some day have material worthy of  her. SHEILA BENSON  </P></p>

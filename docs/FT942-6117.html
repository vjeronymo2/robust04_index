			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Mediobanca Mediobanca will be relieved by yesterday's bounce in its share price. Not only does it apparently show that the market is unconcerned by news that four top executives at the Milan merchant bank are under investigation over their role as advisers to the Ferruzzi-Montedison group. The higher share price will also ensure a smoother passage for Mediobanca's forthcoming L1,500bn equity issue. At yesterday's opening price of L15,300, the group's shares were uncomfortably close to minimum level of L15,000 that it had set for the issue. Not that there was ever much doubt that the offering would go ahead. The Italian portion of the issue is apparently already underwritten, while many non-Italian banks would probably not wish to slight such a powerful force in Italian finance by declining to take part in its fundraising. Even if Mediobanca's share price dips beneath L15,000 in the coming weeks, it could still press ahead with the issue. Mediobanca needs the new equity to maintain its grip on Italian industry. Several companies within Mediobanca's sphere have themselves recently issued shares or are planning to do so. The merchant bank therefore needs funds to avoid dilution. The money may also be used to accumulate stakes in the upcoming privatisations of Stet and Enel. Mediobanca's allies have already taken effective control of Banca Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano. Though the government has recently tightened the rules to prevent a recurrence in future privatisations, it remains to be seen whether they will be effective.</p>

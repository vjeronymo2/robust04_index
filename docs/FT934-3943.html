			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Backing for review of child support The controversial Child Support Agency came under renewed fire from MPs yesterday, following publication of a Commons social security committee report broadly endorsing the agency's role in collecting maintenance payments from absent parents. At question time in the Commons Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, welcomed the report and promised to examine recommendations aimed at easing the burden of payments on absentee fathers. Tory backbenchers joined opposition MPs in protesting that the agency was not concentrating on tracing absent parents who failed to pay maintenance for their children. The committee's report called for changes in the formula for calculating maintenance payments to reduce the burden on absent fathers. It recommended that big increases in maintenance be phased in over up to two years. It endorsed the principles behind the agency, however, in spite of widespread concern about the way maintenance is calculated. Mr Lilley said reaction to the agency came from 'men who were reluctant to pay in full the costs of maintaining their children'. He added: 'It is inevitable there should be some resistance to paying in full the costs of maintaining children if people have not been doing so up to now.' Mr Bill Cash, Conservative MP for Stafford, said Tory backbenchers were 'delighted' that the workings of the agency were to be reviewed. 'There are a number of very serious problems which I have come across in my constituency.' Mr Adam Ingram, Labour MP for East Kilbride, said there was 'very real anger' at the way government policy had been enforced. Mr Lilley replied that in 96 per cent of cases dealt with by the agency the mothers and children had been on benefit while the fathers usually had a reasonable income. Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the Commons committee, said it was 'imperative' that the government accepted in full the report's recommendations. 'Failure to do so, or to cherry pick over the recommendations, will lead to a breaking up of political support for this reform.'</p>

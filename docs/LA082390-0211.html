			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REWARD OFFER BRINGS 'HOT TIPS' IN TRIPLE KILLING  </P> <P> Investigators in the execution-style murder of three auto parts store employees  were pursuing "several promising leads" Wednesday that could lead to an arrest,  a police spokesman said, and they have determined that $1,100 was stolen during  the slayings.  </P> <P> Tustin Police Lt. Houston Williams, who is heading the probe into Monday's  triple murder, said detectives have received several "hot tips" generated in  part by a $50,000 reward offered by the victims' employer.  </P> <P> "We have several people we are looking at," Williams said. "But we are not  prepared to call them suspects (yet). . . . The last thing that I want to do is  put anything out in the press and spook a suspect into running."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Super Shops store, located at Tustin Avenue and 1st Street,  reopened for business Wednesday after police completed the long chore of  sorting through computerized receipts. Initial investigations had found nothing  missing in the store, but a manager later pointed investigators to a  compartment of the safe that had been overlooked. The day's cash receipts were  kept in that part of the safe.  </P> <P> Company President Gregg Koechlein said investigators completed their audit at 3  a.m. Wednesday and discovered a loss of about $1,100.  </P> <P> "The motive for the slayings now appears to be a cover-up for robbery,"  Williams said.  </P> <P> A manager of the store, which opened three months ago, arrived at work about 9  a.m. Monday and discovered the bodies of Darrell Esgar, 22, of Huntington  Beach, Chad Chadwick, 22, of Orange, and Russel B. Williams, 21, of Seal Beach.  </P> <P> Each had been shot in the head at close range, police said. One of the victims  had his hands and feet bound, another had his hands bound and the third had  only his feet bound.  </P> <P> Investigators said the three victims appear to have been shot about 6 p.m.  Sunday. Williams said investigators are trying to determine who was at the  store Sunday and at what time they left.  </P> <P> Police also said they have determined the caliber of weapon used in the  slayings, but declined to provide other details.  </P> <P> Super Shops President Koechlein said the $50,000 reward offered by the company  has prompted many of the tips that police are following.  </P> <P> "From what (police) told me, the response has been really overwhelming," he  said. "It's gratifying to see that."  </P></p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / The Rail Dispute: Pay curb halted 5.7% deal - June offer would have avoided conflict A deal over signalmen's pay could have been reached early last month between Railtrack and the RMT transport union, written evidence to the Commons employment committee showed yesterday. The deal would have avoided the industrial conflict which includes a further 24-hour strike today. But it was torpedoed by government intervention on the grounds that the deal would have breached its policy on pay in the public sector. The evidence emerged at a public session of the committee at which MPs questioned Mr Robert Horton, Railtrack chairman, and Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the union. It was disclosed at the session that Mr Horton had been in regular contact with Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, since the conflict began early last month. Railtrack, a company wholly owned by the government, indicates in its written evidence to the MPs that it believed union negotiators were ready to agree an interim settlement. It would have increased basic pay of signalmen by 5.7 per cent in recognition for past efficiency improvements. The company also discloses that the union was prepared to settle on terms acceptable to Railtrack. Nineteen hours of 'exploratory' talks spread over June 6-8 had brought both sides to the point of a deal. The company says: 'During these talks the Railtrack team formed the view that the RMT might accept an offer of an increase in basic rates in the region of 5.7 per cent (rather than the 11 per cent now claimed) accompanied by some productivity improvements to meet their interim claim and enable negotiations on the main restructuring proposals to proceed.' The Railtrack position is confirmed by the RMT's written evidence to the committee. This states that the company 'offered a 5.7 per cent increase in basic rates of pay with conditions attached in recognition of productivity and lost differentials'. The RMT adds: 'Railtrack indicated they would put this proposal to us formally on June 9 but this never materialised and under pressure from the government, Railtrack withdrew it on 13 June.' In its evidence Railtrack adds that 'the company's negotiating team reported back on June 9 on the exploratory talks held over the previous three days and the board discussed various options to resolve the dispute in the light of these talks'. That board meeting adjourned without a decision and then reconvened on the following Monday. By the time the directors met again the line had changed - because of intervention by the Department of Transport.</p>

Security forces and  police are out in force today to prevent disturbances. Leaders  of the Israeli Arab community have promised Police Minister  Moshe Shahal and senior police officers that they will work to  ensure quiet during the many rallies scheduled. More from  reporter Dani Gur-Arye:    [Begin recording] The day each year in which Israeli Arabs  protest government confiscation of land will be marked this year  in the shadow of the Hebron massacre and recent incidents in the  territories. For the first time in years shops, schools, and  public offices will be closed throughout the Arab sector.  Rallies are expected in the main cities and towns. Police are  hoping the demonstrations will be held quietly, but are prepared  to deal with disturbances. Arab leaders have asked the public  to refrain from outbursts of violence. [passage omitted]    On March 30 18 years ago policemen opened fire on Arabs  demonstrating against confiscation of land. Six Israeli Arabs  were killed. This year Police Minister Moshe Shahal says police  will concentrate on safeguarding the main roads, but will not  enter the population centers. The main rally will be held this  afternoon for the first time in the Bedouin town of Rahat. A  month ago police shot dead a youth in Rahat in the riots  following the Hebron massacre. Both sides are hoping to avoid  similar incidents today. [end recording]    In the territories as well, security forces are on alert to  prevent trouble on Land Day. A Qol Yisra'el reporter says the  IDF [Israel Defense Forces] plans to keep forces away from  Palestinian population centers, to prevent unnecessary friction,  and to avoid as much as possible any casualties. At the same  time the Army will be out in force along major access routes.  [passage omitted]</p>

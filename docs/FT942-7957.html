			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / International Company News: Loss that intensified a war of words - Seafield's battle with dissident shareholders The announcement last week of a Pounds 24.2m loss on turnover of Pounds 27.5m in 1993 by Seafield, the Dublin-based transport and distribution company, intensified the war of words between the management and dissident shareholders. Shareholders in the troubled group have seen its net worth fall from Pounds 61.2m in 1989 to Pounds 11.1m at the end of last year. The latest losses were 'the direct result of the ill-conceived decision to acquire a property development company near the peak of the property market, a decision taken by the board chaired by Mr Wilson,' Mr Brian Chilver, the chairman, wrote to shareholders. He was referring to Mr Tony Wilson, former executive chairman of the group, and the 1989 acquisition of Charterhall Properties, which was sold late last year at a loss. Mr Wilson and Mr Robert Cosby, a corporate adviser, have been nominated by the dissidents to replace as directors Mr Chilver and Mr Richard Hayes, who was involved in the Charterhall purchase, at an extraordinary meeting to be held in Dublin on June 10. Mr Cosby described last week's results as 'much worse than the requisitioning shareholder group had been fearing.' Turnover and operating profit on continuing operations had fallen. 'Unlike Mr Chilver, this is not what we would describe as the road to recovery.' The dissidents represent 25.4 per cent of the shares, and claim their support is growing. Of these the biggest single shareholder is Fidex International Trust, an offshore trust with 18.5 per cent. It was the main shareholder in Charterhall, which was chaired at the time by its founder Mr James Smith. Seafield paid around Pounds 70m in cash and shares, partly funded by a Pounds 58m rights issue at 150p a share. On Friday, the shares stood at 12 1/2 p. Mr Wilson nurses an ambition to return to the transport and distribution company which he built by acquisition while executive chairman. He claims that he wanted to resign and lead a management buy-out of the transport group when it ventured into the property market, but was urged to stay until the Charterhall deal was complete. The Charterhall purchase, according to Mr Wilson, was arranged by Mr Dennis Jones, the 1980s entrepreneur. Mr Jones was a Seafield director and large shareholder who at the time was also finance director of Hazelwood Foods. Mr Hayes assisted Mr Jones, Mr Wilson said. Seafield paid an arrangement fee of more than Pounds 1m to Mr Jones, but the company's auditors discovered it had not been mentioned in the rights documentation. Mr Wilson resigned afer the purchase and was ultimately followed as chairman by Mr Chilver, who had been chairman of Laing Properties. Mr Chilver, however, would not agree to a management buy-out of the transport division. Mr Wilson remains sore. 'Mr Chilver likes to present things as though I dreamed up the whole excursion into property - nothing could be further from the truth,' he says. Mr Chilver, who became chairman in July 1990, accepts that it is probably true that Mr Wilson was not keen on the foray into property, but in that case he should have resigned at once. He himself did not realise when he joined that the problems were quite so severe. The group did not have the muscle to stay in the property sector in a declining market. One particular site in Finchley, north London, 'must have cost Pounds 30m in write-offs over the last four years.' He points out that Pounds 17.5m of the latest loss represents goodwill written off on Charterhall. The purchase was originally based on profits stream, not assets - a move he dismisses as 'stupid'. The way is now clear to develop the transport and distribution business, he says, blaming the fall in the division's operating profits from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 804,000 on the European recession. He regrets the dissident move, which came out of the blue and led to Imari, a private Irish transport company seeking a listing, to withdraw from merger talks last week. Seafield has survived where many property companies did not, but it is now right back to square one. Mr Cosby, who will be chairman if the dissidents win, says he joined the fray because something had to be done to stop the company spiralling downwards. 'They were throwing away the shareholders' money.' He argues that as a transport and distribution group, the company will be much better served by the re-appointment of Mr Wilson - 'the man responsible for successfully building up its transport and distribution activities.' Mr Chilver, who argues that Seafield has maintained its reputation as an efficient transport business throughout the last four turbulent years, predicts: 'We should win as long as there is not too much inertia among shareholders.'</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Books: War, death and superstition - Tibor Fischer finds truth can be stranger than fiction IN PHARAOH'S ARMY by Tobias Wolff Bloomsbury Pounds 12.99, 210 pages THE CURE by Carlo Gebler Hamish Hamilton Pounds 14.99, 306 pages WHO WILL RUN THE FROG HOSPITAL? by Lorrie Moore Faber Pounds 14.99, 148 pages THE SECRET LIFE OF LASZLO, COUNT DRACULA by Roderick Anscombe Bloomsbury Pounds 15.99, 409 pages In Pharaoh's Army is the sequel to the much-lauded autobiographical This Boy's Life, but it is also an outstanding addition to the library on the Vietnam War. Appropriately enough for a book composed a quarter of a century after the events the prose has a cool poise and, compared with the frenzy of Michael Herr's Dispatches or the brutality of Larry Heinemann's fiction, seems almost gentle and unAmerican. Tobias Wolff drifted into the army, the Special Forces and then the Officer Candidate School - a course he only managed to pass because of his talents in managing the graduation night revue. 'They kept me on to produce a farce. That's how I became an officer in the United States Army.' There are other passages that are so symbolic that they would invite derision if featured in a novel: Wolff leads his men on a parachute jump that puts them smack in the middle of a rubbish dump, for example. Despite being a Green Beret, In Pharaoh's Army demonstrates that Wolff was as gung-ho as Franz Kafka ('I was completely incompetent to lead a Special Forces team,' he confides in the opening pages). Fortunately for him, because of his knowledge of Vietnamese ('like a seven-year-old with a freakish military vocabulary') he finds himself posted as adviser to a South Vietnamese artillery unit, where he spends a not too-combative year getting a big enough television to enjoy Bonanza and saving dogs from Vietnamese barbecues until the Tet offensive bloodily lumbers up to his quarters. The figures are well-known: imbecile officers, all-knowing sergeants, wily natives - Wolff makes it so funny, moving and memorable you feel it has never been written about before. Carlo Gebler's The Cure takes brutality of the hearthside variety as its theme. His novel, set in rural 19th century Ireland, relates how Bridget Cleary ends up being doused with paraffin and set alight by her doting husband, who then shoves her into the grate to smoulder away. All this while her family and assorted acquaintances stand around. It is a tribute to Gebler's skill that this climactic immolation seems inevitable: 'rules were rules and as the creature must have known there was always a right of recourse to fire'. Michael Cleary is not murdering his wife, but eliminating a fairy changeling in order to recover her. The whole book revolves around beliefs, whether of the superstitious or motivating variety - Gebler rips open the heads of all the characters. Bridget herself helps to build the superstructure of superstition that dominates village life. 'From the moment you pricked your finger,' she says to her cousin shortly before her death, 'I knew there was going to be bad news coming'. In its prose The Cure is clear and spare, in its horrific depiction of a woman executed by her nearest and dearest only comparable to Freidoune Sahebjam's La Femme Lapide. First rate, but not a book likely to be promoted by the Irish Tourist Board. Mention of Proust on the first page of a novel is usually a bad sign, but Lorrie Moore is too good at brevity and too contemptuous of the French to commit any Proustian sins. Who Will Run the Frog Hospital? has the narrator, Berie, picking over her adolescence, but the style is punchy and at 148 pages is really two collided short stories (Moore is one of the finest short story writers in the US) rather than a novel. The substance of this witty and poetic book is Berie's friendship with Sils, who works with her at an amusement park for pocket money; we get a portrait of intimacy, mooching in clubs, an elegy for teenage kicks. Incidents are few: Sils gets pregnant, Berie pilfers money for an abortion, gets caught, gets sent to a Baptist summer camp. Moore renders this through superb one-liners and a great gift for creating mood. One of the most poignant elements of In Pharaoh's Army is the death of Wolff's friend, Hugh Pierce. Lorrie Moore powerfully shows how you do not need a war to lose a close friend. Loss and irretrievability permeate both works. The Secret Life of Laszlo, Count Dracula is, as the title suggests, a Magyar Psycho. Laszlo, scion of a noble Hungarian family, leaves Transylvania to study medicine in Paris. Enjoying the fleshpots of the city, he slashes the throat of a demimondaine and flees. Back at the ancestral seat 20 years later, as the reader may have guessed, he discovers that killing women and drinking their blood is his bag. Bonus sub-plot involving Hungarian nationalists plotting against Austrian domination. Readable tosh, the only notable thing about this is that it is written by an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School who works with the criminally insane. Sadly this Dracula does not get beyond the elementary beast within.</p>

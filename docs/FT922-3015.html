			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Gardening: Plant of the Week - Kolkwitzia Pink Cloud This is the best variety of Kolkwitzia amabilis, a very free-flowering deciduous shrub that flowers in early June. It is usually six to eight feet high and has long arching branches crowded with deep pink flowers. American gardeners, who seem to have taken to it more rapidly than those in the UK, call it the Beauty Bush. It is quite hardy, unfussy about soil and it can be pruned, if it gets too big, by cutting off the old flowering stems immediately the flowers fade. If it is increased by seed some seedlings may be of inferior colour or performance. Pink Cloud should be increased by summer cuttings to keep it true to type.</p>

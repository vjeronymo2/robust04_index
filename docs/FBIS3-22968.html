The 12 were arrested and were found in possession of  leaflets  propagating ideas of Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (Islamic Groups).    The leaflets also objected to interrogations being carried  out with the Arabic weekly "AL-SHA'B," mouthpiece of the Labour  Party.    Investigations revealed that the group were planning to  provide hideouts for fugitive terrorist elements.    They were also found in possession of arms which they  intended to use in terrorist operations.</p>

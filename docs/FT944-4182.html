			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Observer: We presume Well, what indeed should be the moniker attaching to this impending grand union? Image consultants get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for this sort of thing, but here is Observer's first try, gratis. The most obvious, Morgan Warburg, has to be ditched right away - too close to Deutsche Bank-owned Morgan Grenfell. Warburg would want a sharper distinction from its old rival - even if a degree of fellow feeling might be kindled between proud Brits forced to fall back on foreigners' superior resources. Warburg Morgan or Warburg Morgan Stanley is a non-starter, seeing that the Americans will constitute two-thirds of the new company. Stanley Warburg, on the other hand, is worse - sounds like a long-lost relative of old Sir Siegmund's. All of which suggests that the pair will wind up with the most obvious: Morgan Stanley Warburg. A bit of a mouthful, but not so dreadful in a business which has suffered handles such as Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner &amp; Smith.</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> RATTLES AND HUMS: Motley Crue is apparently still at work on its upcoming  album, "Too Hot to Handle." In addition to the title track, the band has loads  of originals like "Dollar in My Pocket," "Poisonous Dreams" and "Dead Man" --  plus a raucous cover of "California Girls". . . . Iron Maiden is taking a year  off from recording while singer Bruce Dickenson finishes a novel about a  transvestite. . . . Talk about a real Richard Thompson fan: John Mellencamp  drummer Kenny Aronoff called to get tickets to a recent Thompson show in  Bloomington, Ind., only to find that the concert had been canceled after  Thompson's drummer slipped in the shower and broke his arm. Aronoff offered to  fill in and not only played that night, but also finished out the tour with  Thompson.  </P></p>

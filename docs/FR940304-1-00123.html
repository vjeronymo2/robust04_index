(California Energy Commission, No. 24 at 6). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response, the Department notes that the appliance labeling program is administered by the Federal Trade Commission. It will be the Federal Trade Commission's decision, not the Department's, whether to bring pool heaters under labeling requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Clothes Washers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a final rule regarding standards for three types of appliances, including clothes washers, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on May 14, 1991 (56 FR 22250), the Department announced that it was accelerating the second review of energy efficiency standards for clothes washers. In response to that notice, a number of energy-efficiency advocates and appliance manufacturers requested that the Department delay the second review until 1995&hyph;96. <FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>  The additional time was requested in order to allow manufacturers time to implement the standards imposed by the 1991 final rule and to fully evaluate new, more energy-efficient technologies such as top-loading horizontal-axis clothes washers. This additional time, manufacturers contend, will enable them to provide more meaningful and relevant comments on the next, legislatively required rulemaking. The Department considered the request, and by letter, dated February 26, 1992, notified the parties requesting the delay that the Department had determined that it will conduct the rulemaking on the later schedule, as requested. <FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 34 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ACEEE, AHAM, NRDC, No. 89 at 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 35 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> J.

Fluorescent Lamp Ballasts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Classes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several fluorescent ballast class issues were raised in the comments on the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. One comment supported the Department's proposed classes. (Advance Transformer, No. 25 at 2). On the other hand, a number of comments recommended additional classes for fluorescent lamp ballasts based on the size and type of lamp for which the ballast is designed. One set of comments proposed adding three and four-lamp F40T12 ballasts and F32T8 ballasts as product classes. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 2; Public Citizen, No. 7 at 3; Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 26; Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 3; California Energy Commission, No. 24 at 6; Northwest Power Planning Council, No. 32 at 2; and Sierrra Club, No. 43 at 2). Several comments proposed adding ballasts for compact fluorescent lamps as a product class. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 26; Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 3; Northwest Power Planning Council, No. 32 at 2; and Sierra Club, No. 43 at 2). Lastly, three comments proposed that dimming features on ballasts warrant a separate class, since such ballasts provide the utility to vary light output. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy No. 6 at 5; California Energy Commission, No. 24 at 7; Northwest Power Planning Council, No. 32 at 6). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response, the Department has added three and four-lamp F40T12 ballasts and one, two, three, and four-lamp F32T8 ballasts to the list of product classes. These new classes will all have unique ballast efficiency factors. Compact fluorescent ballasts, however, are integrated with a lamp and sold as one package. As such, one cannot determine the efficiency of the ballast separate from the lamp. Although dimming ballasts do provide a unique utility to vary light output, the Department believes that such ballasts do not warrant a separate class. At full light output, their energy efficiency is expected to be equal to that of non-dimming ballasts. Therefore, any standard developed for non-dimming ballasts will apply to dimming ballasts operated at full light output. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

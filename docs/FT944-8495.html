			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / International Company News: LVMH sells 4% of Guinness LVMH, the French luxury goods group, has sold a 4 per cent stake in Guinness, reducing its holding in the UK drinks company to 20 per cent. The French group, which made a pre-tax capital gain of about Pounds 50m (Dollars 82m) on the sale, said the move was in line with an agreement made at the start of the year when the two companies restructured their cross-shareholdings. Under the terms of the agreement, Guinness exchanged its 24 per cent stake in LVMH for a 34 per cent holding in Moet Hennessy, the LVMH cognac and champagne business. LVMH said it had no plans to reduce its Guinness holding further. 'We are merely completing the restructuring of our shareholding which we agreed in January,' it said. Some industry observers expressed surprise at the timing of the move. 'I thought they might wait in the expectation of a strengthening in the Guinness share price,' said one analyst at a French merchant bank. 'LVMH had until next June to make the sale, and the beer and spirits markets may improve with economic recovery.' Sale proceeds will strengthen LVMH. Its net debts - about FFr15bn (Dollars 2.8bn) at the start of the year - will fall to about FFr4.6bn. Mr Bernard Arnault, LVMH chairman, has used the group's improved financial position to launch a series of acquisitions. Following the conclusion of January's agreement with Guinness, the French group took a majority stake in Guerlain, the fragrance house, in a FFr1.9bn deal.</p>

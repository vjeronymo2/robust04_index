			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TRUMP QUESTIONS ALL THE FUSS  </P> <P> Donald Trump seems surprised that his split with his wife, Ivana, has been such  a running story in the New York tabloids and the British press. In a  rush-to-print interview in the upcoming New York magazine, the billionaire  developer expressed surprise that coverage of the Steven Spielberg-Amy Irving  and Jane Fonda-Tom Hayden splits were such one-day stories, while his goes on  and on.  </P> <P> He said that women he has never met are "saying that I was with them, too.  Because they'll get some publicity. . . . Famous women, I could give you their  names . . . have been calling the newspapers, their agents have been calling,  saying they were with me, trying to get their pictures in one of the so-called  conquests."  </P> <P> Trump has especially harsh words for some of Ivana's pals in the wealthy social  set, who are generally siding with her in Trump: The Divorce. "I generally find  them to be extremely unattractive people, among the most unattractive I've ever  met. I find women that buy $25,000 dresses -- they try to make themselves more  attractive by putting on $25,000 dresses, and then they walk into the ballroom  and nobody notices them anyway."  </P></p>

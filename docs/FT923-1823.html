			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / International Company News: Hongkong Land shows 3.7% rise to Dollars 152.8m at halfway HONGKONG Land, one of the colony's leading property investment and development companies, has reported a 3.7 per cent rise in net profits to USDollars 152.8m for the first half to June, up from Dollars 147.3m a year earlier, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. Earnings per share for the half year were 5.84 cents, up from 5.75 cents. The directors recommended a rise in the interim dividend to 3 cents a share from 2.85 cents. Turnover slipped to Dollars 194.3m from Dollars 195.1m. Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said the company was likely to show similar profits growth for the rest of the year. 'Although open market rentals in Hong Kong are again showing some increase, the effect of the group's three-year rent review cycle means that the profit growth in the full year is unlikely to be markedly different from that in the first six months,' Mr Keswick said. Occupancy in the group's office properties remained at 97 per cent, while open market rents had shown a modest increase since the start of the year. Hongkong Land is one third owned by Jardine Strategic, which in turn is 52 per cent owned by Jardine Matheson.</p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROTHER, CAN YOU SPARE A COUPON?;  </P> <P> SKID ROW'S WEINGART CENTER COOKS UP A NOVEL WAY OF ASSISTING HUNGRY PEOPLE OF  THE STREETS.  </P> <P> Maxene Johnston had come downtown for dinner and a movie when the panhandler  approached her, begging for money.  </P> <P> "I felt assaulted, insulted," she recalled. "I thought, 'This makes me feel  uncomfortable.' "  </P> <P> As president of the Weingart Center Assn. and doyenne of the private, nonprofit  group's 600-bed service facility at 6th and San Pedro streets, Johnston is  surrounded daily by poor people, and she understands their problems.  </P> <P> But as a well-dressed, successful businesswoman, she also understands from  personal experience what she calls the "assault on the conscience" that  panhandlers pose for the public.  </P> <P> Johnston mulled that discomfort along with other problems she was brainstorming  -- how to feed hungry street people and get them to Weingart Center for job  counseling or health care, and what to do about a $200,000 annual deficit in  the center's food program.  </P> <P> "Then I just sort of woke up one morning and said 'Food coupons!' " she said  this week in her 12th-floor office overlooking Skid Row.  </P> <P> Selling coupons to businesses for distribution to their employees, she thought,  could accomplish three things:  </P> <P> * Help the public (the employees) feel good by handing out a free meal instead  of money, which a panhandler might use for drugs or alcohol.  </P> <P> * Help the panhandler by assuring him a free nutritious meal, and motivating  him to visit the center where additional help is available.  </P> <P> * Help the Center Cafe break even.  </P> <P> So, she launched a pilot program last spring, asking center board members to  distribute coupons through their downtown businesses or law firms.  </P> <P> When the results were tallied at the end of June, 1,390 of the $2.50 coupons  had been sold to businesses or individuals, and 555 had been redeemed for  breakfast, lunch or dinner in the spiffy Center Cafe.  </P> <P> Johnston knew she had a winner when she offered some change to a panhandler  outside the Ketcham YMCA atop Bunker Hill one day and was asked by the  disappointed beggar: "Don't you have one of them Weingart coupons?" Center food  service director Jane F. Sieck found that the coupons brought new faces to the  food lines, which could eventually lower production costs. She said each  complete meal, priced at $2.50 to walk-in customers, costs about $3 to produce.  Now serving 300 to 700 meals a day, Sieck said the cafe could easily serve  1,000 with the same labor force, reducing the per-meal cost.  </P> <P> Because even the unredeemed coupons were paid for, the coupon project helped  defray the deficit for meals actually served.  </P> <P> And, her worst fear was allayed when the coupons were redeemed only a few at a  time.  </P> <P> "It turned out very well," she said, "because they didn't all come in the next  day and say, 'Let's have lunch!' "  </P> <P> Now Johnston and her board are brainstorming again about launching a full-scale  coupon program, or, as she puts it, "How to get the word out and the money in."  </P> <P> She is ready to tailor the program to any group's wishes.  </P> <P> The downtown office of the Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corp. employees  said they wanted to help, but did not particularly want to hand out coupons to  panhandlers. So she worked out a plan in which the employees will raise $30,000  to buy food coupons and give them to Para Los Ninos, a Skid Row service agency,  for distribution to needy children and families.  </P> <P> During the pilot program, some businesses paid for the coupons but chose to  donate them back to Weingart Center. Because most of the center's programs  provide beds and counseling but no food, Johnston put the coupons to good use.  </P> <P> A typical recipient was Pascale Summers, 20, a Parisian who had moved to New  York to start school, then married an American and came to California with him.  Homeless and penniless, the couple obtained beds at Weingart Center but still  needed food.  </P> <P> "I was looking for a job, and my stomach was growling," said Summers, who has  subsequently found work. "I was ashamed."  </P> <P> A man waiting for counseling at the center, who did not give his name, looked  with interest at a sample coupon Johnston showed him.  </P> <P> "The majority would use them," he said. "Some would sell them to somebody else  who would use them to come down here and eat. It may go through about five  people, but people would eat with it."  </P> <P> Sieck said a few of the coupons received had been tattered, indicating that  they may have gone through several hands. But she believes that most of the  people fed were the original coupon recipients.  </P> <P> Those handing out the coupons seemed even more enthusiastic than the  recipients.  </P> <P> Center general counsel Timothy F. Ryan said his law firm, McLaughlin &amp;  Irvin, bought coupons and distributed them to employees -- particularly females  -- to hand out near their office at 8th Street and Grand Avenue.  </P> <P> "A lot of our female staff are intimidated by the panhandlers," Ryan said, "and  we thought this was a way we could help them."  </P> <P> Both individuals and companies in the pilot program agreed that they would buy  more coupons, although Ryan suggested that companies could better afford the  cost.  </P> <P> "The $2.50 might be a lot for an individual who would ordinarily give a  panhandler a quarter," he said. "But for a firm, this is a nice way to make a  contribution."  </P> <P> Judith L. Sweeney, an associate with the financial management firm McKinsey  &amp; Co. at 400 S. Hope St. on Bunker Hill, bought 20 of the coupons and  handed them out at lunch or dinner hour near her office over a couple of weeks.  </P> <P> "Some were receptive," she said, describing the panhandlers' reaction. "When I  said the coupon was good for a free meal, they were very, very excited and they  said, 'Really?'  </P> <P> "Others were clearly looking for money," Sweeney said. "They just looked  disgruntled. And a couple of people did refuse to take them. They just said  no."  </P> <P> Sweeney said she occasionally gives panhandlers food but never hands out money.  </P> <P> "I have a firm belief that the best way to deal with the homeless in Los  Angeles is through institutions," she said. "By handing out the coupons, you  are supporting the institutions, and not the habits of the homeless that I  might not approve of, like drinking and drugs."  </P> <P> "Some people don't want to give out cash," said her colleague, Rick Beckett,  who found 19 buyers among the 20 people he solicited in their office. "But most  people want to do something. And this is a good alternative."  </P> <P> Center board member Dean Weiner, a partner in the law firm O'Melveny &amp;  Myers on Bunker Hill, said he never gives panhandlers money but he felt good  handing out coupons.  </P> <P> "I am a bit of a soft touch and don't just like walking away from someone  without giving him anything," he said.  </P> <P> "The conventional wisdom is that it is not a good idea to give cash to a  panhandler because it doesn't . . . help him get off the street. But the coupon  directs him to a place where the goal is to help him reach self-sufficiency one  way or the other."  </P></p>

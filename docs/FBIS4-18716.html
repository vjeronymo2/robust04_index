Here is a statement by the spokesman of the  French Foreign Ministry Richard Duque:    [Begin Duque recording] First, France deplores the brutal  death of the Rwandan and Burundian presidents. We would like to  extend our condolences to the families of the presidents and to  the families of the other victims. You also know that the crew  were French. We deplore their deaths and extend our condolences  to their families as well. We do not have any particular  information on the circumstances in which the plane of the  Rwandan president crashed yesterday evening. We think that  there is a need for an international investigation in order to  find out precisely what caused the crash and who was  responsible. [end recording]    An emergency meeting was held this morning in Paris. There  were representatives of the presidency, the prime minister, and  of the ministries of defense and foreign affairs. The French  forces based in Bangui, in the Central African Republic, have  been put on alert.

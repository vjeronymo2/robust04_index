			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Anyone who has seen those 1968 photos of sculptor Beverly Pepper clad in  calf-length boots standing next to her enormous polished aluminum cubes has  wondered how this statuesque woman could craft those Gargantuan, imposing  forms. Well, 20 years and a major Brooklyn Museum retrospective later, Pepper  is still peeling off expectations as fast as we form them. Without missing a  beat, Pepper has switched from the airy Bauhaus precision of her aluminum work  to "urban altars" and "columns" -- stalwart, dense forms made from rough hewn,  dark cast iron with crusty surface textures that take our minds forward to  factory debris and backward to fertility totems or votive grave markers.  </P> <P> The columns predominate in this show. Set on clunky little mounds or small  stepped stages, the long lean shafts slice the air, looking like second cousins  to those spare, mythical sculptures Noguchi made to accompany Martha Graham's  dances. Structurally the works are based on complex variations of elongated  hexagonal or octagonal tubes, which tends to give works the look of giant tools  for tightening bolts. In some pieces, Pepper divides the multi-sided shafts  into two abutting mirror halves with the thinnest strip of air running up their  center so that they look like giant, perfectly perched tuning forks. Names such  as "Vertical Presence I" or "Ritual Sentinel" confirm some personal mythology  operating here, and completion dates from 1981 to 1989 indicate that every  subtle counterpoint of weight, balance, internal vs external pressure we  experience but cannot articulate has been rigorously planned. Whether this work  is your cup of tea or not, Pepper is a major sculptor who merits attention.  (James Corcoran Gallery, 1327 5th St., to May 20.) MARLENA DONOHUE  </P></p>

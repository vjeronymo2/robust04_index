			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Mersey in talks with Medway THE MERSEY Docks &amp; Harbour Company announced yesterday that it was 'in the early stages of exclusive discussions' which could lead to it acquiring Medway Ports, bought by its management and employees for Pounds 54m and the assumption of Pounds 17m of debt in March 1992. Earlier this week Medway revealed that it had received a number of approaches from potential bidders, including Forth Ports and Powell Duffryn. Neither Mersey nor Medway would reveal details about the talks because confidentiality agreements have been signed. However, at the beginning of the month, when he was announcing plans for Medway's stock market flotation - expected to raise about Pounds 70m - Mr Peter Vincent, its chief executive, did not rule out the possibility of becoming part of a larger ports group. In February, Mr Trevor Furlong, Mersey's managing director, said that Mersey Docks was still looking to buy an east coast port that would provide synergy at the European end of a UK land bridge. The reasons Medway would favour a merger with Mersey are thought to include the prospects for the enlarged business, price, and management teams which see eye to eye. A combined Mersey/Medway would be the second largest grouping after Associated British Ports. Medway controls Sheerness, a deep water port which has eschewed containers and handles cars and fruit and forest produce. Medway also controls the former Royal Navy dockyard at Chatham, which includes 140 acres of development land next to the Medway road tunnel, currently under construction. The government still holds a 20 per cent stake in Mersey which the company said would be sold when 'appropriate'. The Labour Party last night accused the government of privatising Medway, which was owned by a local trust, for 'a knock down price'. Ms Joan Walley, shadow transport minister, said she would call on Sir John Bourn, the comptroller and auditor general, to hold an investigation into last year's sale. The Department of Trade and Industry said Medway was 'a private sector port and it's up to them what they now do.'</p>

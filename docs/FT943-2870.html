			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: French groups fight for Com-Dev Six French industrial and media groups are set to compete to buy Com-Dev, the cable television operations of the Caisse des Depots et Consignations, the state financial institution. Com-Dev is one of France's largest cable television operators with about 200,000 subscribers and network connections to a total of 400,000 buildings. However, like most other French cable operators it continues to suffer losses. Last year it recorded a deficit of FFr480m (Dollars 90.7m), of which about FFr400m related to the cost of investment in building the network. The companies interested in buying all or part of the cable business are thought to include France Telecom, Chargeurs, Lyonnaise Communications, TDF, Generale des Eaux, and a subsidiary of Electricite de France. Most have activities in the media or telecommunications sectors. Generale des Eaux, the construction, utilities and communications group, is France's largest cable television operator with about 450,000 residences connected to its networks. Mr Willy Stricker, president of Com-Dev, declined to comment on the possible value of the company. He said the cable operator could be sold in separate tranches, but that a global offer would be preferred. A decision on the successful candidate, or candidates, is expected by the end of the year. The Caisse des Depots wants to sell its cable TV operations because they lie outside its principal financial and investment interests. An attempt last year to sell Com-Dev drew interest from France Telecom and Generale des Eaux. The sale was postponed reportedly because of disagreements on price and the sensitivity of the issue, following the upheavals at Canal Plus, the pay-TV station. Mr Andre Rousselet resigned as chairman of Canal Plus this year following an accord between communications groups.</p>

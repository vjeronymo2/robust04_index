			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFI L.A. INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL: CAPSULE REVIEWS  </P> <P> Following are capsule reviews of today's screenings in the American Film  Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex Odeon Century  Plaza Cinemas:  </P> <P> 'The Mother of Kings'  </P> <P> Poland, 1982, 126 minutes  </P> <P> 8:45  </P> <P> The title is ironic; the three sons of this working-class Warsaw family are  pulled into Communism or petty crime, while their widowed mother continues to  have faith in ideals and/or men who unfailingly let her down during the 30-year  span of the story, from 1930 to 1956. Begun in 1982, then stopped when martial  law was imposed, Janusz Zsorki's tribute to naive tenacity won a prize for its  central actress, Magda Theresa Wojcikz; its brooding black-and-white camera  work is splendid, but it is a long sit and a far too predictable story. --  SHEILA BENSON  </P></p>

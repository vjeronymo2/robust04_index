			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 20 May (MTI) -- Borsod-Abauj-Zemplen  County police are conducting proceedings against Istvan Mosolygo  -- the driver of the car that crashed while carrying Hungarian  Socialist Party (MSZP) Chairman Gyula Horn from an election  rally in Miskolc -- for having allegedly caused a road accident  by careless driving, says a statement issued by the National  Police Command (ORFK) simultaneous to its Friday [20 May] press  conference.    According to the police briefing, the Saab-9000 driven by  Mosolygo, en route from Miskolc to Budapest, crossed the  bisecting line of the road and hit an IFA-type lorry, which was  parked in the opposite lane because of a defect in the trailer's  right rear tyre. The accident occurred on May 5 at 8.45 P.M.  [1845 GMT] on highway No. 3 between Nyekladhaza and Emod.  Mosolygo, Horn, and his escort, retired police-major Jeno  Zsidey, sustained serious injuries in the accident. According  to investigations so far, neither Mosolygo nor the lorry-driver  were intoxicated.    The police survey of the scene of the accident showed that  the lorry stood on the left side of the road, 0.7-1.2 meters  from the bisecting line. The passengers in the Saab observed no  oncoming traffic, nor did they see any pedestrians, cyclists, or  animals nearby, and only Zsidey claimed to have seen a sudden  flash of light. Mosolygo cannot remember what happened before  or during the crash.    There was no witness to raise suspicion that the crash had  been caused deliberately, the National Police Command told  reporters at the press conference called in Budapest on Friday  after investigations into the accident came to an end.    In response to questions from reporters, the National Police  Commissioner, Brigadier-General Sandor Pinter, said that on  March 25 the ORFK had offered personal escorts to all eight  parliamentary parties, but none availed themselves of the  opportunity. He made it a point to stress that the car carrying  the person under police escort never goes ahead, as was the case  with the convoy of three cars accompanying Horn on his return  from Miskolc.    Prior to the accident, Horn received several threatening  telephone calls, and police patrols had been assigned to  regularly check the vicinity of the MSZP chairman's residence,  Pinter said.</p>

			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Danes rule out short cuts to treaty accord DENMARK is calling on the rest of the European Community to go ahead with ratification of the Maastricht treaty this autumn without waiting for any breakthrough in the confusion caused by its No vote three months ago. Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish foreign minister, said the EC could not expect any 'smart moves' or 'short cuts' to resolve the imbroglio sparked by the Danish referendum on June 2. Britain says it will not re-submit the Maastricht legislation to parliament until Denmark has come up with proposals to make the European union plan more palatable to the Danish electorate. However, Mr Ellemann-Jensen told the Financial Times he expected Britain to continue with the EC plan, agreed in June, to proceed with ratification. Even if France says Yes to the treaty in its referendum on September 20, the Danish government believes the question of Danish participation may take until next summer to be resolved. This indicates that the fate of the treaty will be put on ice at least until that date, as it cannot come into force until all 12 EC members have ratified it. 'Those who expect a second Danish referendum before the end of the year can forget it,' Mr Ellemann-Jensen said. Calling the Danish rejection 'a crisis for our political system', he emphasised the care the government would take to try to find a solution acceptable both to the electorate and to Denmark's EC partners. He hoped that a 'rough framework' might be worked out at the EC summit in Edinburgh in early December. Any formula, however, would have to be put to a second vote by the Danish people next year. He declined to give firm ideas on how the treaty text could be refashioned to overcome Danish objections. The white paper on Maastricht promised by the Danes for the first half of October is unlikely to contain definite proposals for a way out of the impasse. It will mainly be a list of legal problems created for Denmark and its partners by the possibility of a separate Danish path on Europe. Mr Ellemann-Jensen, who campaigned strongly for the treaty three months ago, said he felt 'very humble' about its rejection and considered, 'for 10 seconds', resigning. Among the options being considered in Copenhagen are adding protocols to the treaty to define more closely how EC decision-making can be brought closer to the people - the so-called subsidiarity principle. Denmark also favours building into the treaty provisions limiting Denmark's participation in common European defence. This was a particular stumbling block with Danish voters. Mr Ellemann-Jensen said the latest opinion polls had shown that, although opposition to Maastricht was even greater than in June, Danish support for the EC and Nato was as strong as ever.</p>

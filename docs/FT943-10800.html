			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / People: Ocean Group seeks skipper Nicholas Barber, 53, chief executive of Ocean Group for the last eight years, has left the transportation conglomerate and a new pilot has yet to be found. Peter Marshall, 67, Ocean's non-executive chairman has taken the helm in the interim. Barber, who joined the company in 1964, announced in April that he planned to step down this year. He says that he had always wanted to go in his mid-fifties so that he could spend more time on his outside interests. In addition to being a non-executive director of Royal Insurance and Barings, he is a governor of London Business School and a trustee of the British Museum. Barber took over as chief executive shortly after Ocean had defeated a Pounds 300m takeover bid from Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand corporate predator. During his tenure the company has been transformed from a traditional shipping company into a transport services group with interests ranging from air freight forwarding to offshore oil support services. However, there has been some concern in the City that Ocean has not fulfilled its early promise at the time of the unwelcome takeover bid. Profits have stagnated, dividend growth has been sluggish, and Ocean shares have underperformed by more than a third since Barber took over. Sir Ron Brierley placed his hostile stake at 340p a share in September 1989 and less than two years later Ocean raised Pounds 88m through a rights issue at 295p a share. However, Ocean's shares are currently trading at 258p, valuing the company at little over Pounds 400m. Ian Laurie, Ocean's finance director, described Barber's departure as 'extremely amicable' and denied that he had gone earlier than planned. However, there has been some surprise in the City that Barber has left before his successor has been appointed. Barber was on a three year rolling contract and will receive some sort of 'golden handshake'. It is understood that this will be mainly in the form of enhanced pension contributions and payment in respect of his contract is expected to be less than Pounds 100,000. Laurie said that the search for a new chief executive was 'well in hand'.</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FEW IN NORTH COUNTY JOIN MERGER FRAY  </P> <P> With almost missionary fervor, San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor has regularly  condemned the proposed merger of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric with Southern  California Edison, and has summoned other cities to the cause.  </P> <P> But up in San Marcos, they don't much care that O'Connor has declared the  utility marriage the most important issue of her political career, or that San  Diego already has spent $2 million fighting the plan.  </P> <P> "There's the attitude that San Diego has always treated North County like  orphans," said San Marcos Mayor Lee Thibadeau, who suggests that the county's  crown city has a thing or two to learn about managing its own affairs before  handing down judgments to its neighbors.  </P> <P> For all O'Connor's warning that the immense utility has been a pro-growth force  in the Southland's urban sprawl, Thibadeau scoffed, "San Diego is not far from  becoming another L.A. itself."  </P> <P> And one city away from San Marcos, Escondido Mayor Doris Thurston isn't exactly  dabbing moist eyes at the prospect of losing SDG&amp;E, with its legendary high  energy bills for consumers.  </P> <P> "We have to face the fact that Southern California Edison is on the cutting  edge and uses state-of-the-art equipment" that could slash rates, Thurston  said.  </P> <P> It's been a year and a half since the merger plan was introduced, and -- aside  from these comments during interviews -- so far there has been virtual  political silence by the nine cities in North County.  </P> <P> Not one city council has taken a position on the issue, and if anything, most  cities seem to view the boiling merger controversy as a nasty little ruckus off  in some distant land. "We are remote from the issue," said Thurston. "It's more  or less become a City of San Diego issue."  </P> <P> Although that sentiment might not be universally shared in North County, there  is clear confusion over the complex merger proposal and a reluctance to get  involved just yet in the issue's noisy polemics.  </P> <P> In a typical comment from a North County mayor, Bud Lewis of Carlsbad groused,  "There is so much propaganda going out, it's hard to tell what's what. We  haven't taken a stand one way or the other."  </P> <P> Such remarks come from the very community leaders whose aid will be sought by  merger foes to help sway public opinion against the utility deal. The county  Board of Supervisors has tentatively decided to hold a countywide June advisory  election on the merger.  </P> <P> The California Public Utilities Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission are reviewing the proposal.  </P> <P> Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers Action Network, said he  counts on the northern city leaders to have a "significant impact on the public  perception" against the merger. He said "the greatest contribution the cities  could make is participating in the advisory vote."  </P> <P> In February or March, "that's when we start going around asking for their  support," he said.  </P> <P> Actually, O'Connor has already done that, appealing for backing before the San  Diego County division of the League of California Cities and coming away with a  letter attacking the virtue of the merger.  </P> <P> But that was early in the game, in December 1988, and since then there's been  nothing to suggest that North County is genuinely galvanized on either side of  the issue.  </P> <P> "I think everybody in North County is taking a wait-and-see position," said  Oceanside City Councilwoman Lucy Chavez.  </P> <P> It probably would take a bolder alliance than that for San Diego to prevail.  Paul Downey, spokesman for O'Connor, said, "It would certainly be helpful to  San Diego's case to have strong opposition to the merger from the other  cities." But, so far, he said, "San Diego, the county and Chula Vista have  really been the three big players" against the merger.  </P> <P> With the cities in North County more geographically and politically distant,  San Diego may find more sympathy among its southern neighbors, such as  Coronado, with which it has a close rapport.  </P> <P> Coronado Mayor Mary Herron, whose City Council has not yet taken a position on  the merger, said, "We're sitting back, watching the big guns shoot at each  other. . . . We see no real reason to get drawn into it as yet."  </P> <P> However, Coronado's mere proximity to San Diego has resulted in the two cities'  working together to solve mutual problems such as sewage disposal.  </P> <P> "I would characterize it as a cordial relationship," said Herron, adding,  though, that the key factor in deciding whether to back the merger is whether  it would lower utility rates for Coronado residents.  </P> <P> The San Diego City Council voted unanimously Nov. 30 to oppose melding  SDG&amp;E with Rosemead-based Edison to create a 4.8-million-customer utility  district, the nation's largest. The vote came one year after SDG&amp;E  directors approved a $2.4-billion stock trade offer with Edison's parent  company, SCEcorp.  </P> <P> O'Connor pronounced it the "most important merger in this country" and the most  critical issue of her political career. Her council's vote authorized City  Atty. John Witt to determine whether the city has legal power to block the  merger by refusing to let SDG&amp;E transfer city franchise agreements to  Edison.  </P> <P> Those franchises give SDG&amp;E the right to send electricity, gas and steam  using city streets, highways and rights of way.  </P> <P> While a court ruling on that franchise question is sought, the broader  controversy rages on. It focuses on whether the merger would mean loss local  control over providing energy, result in higher or lower rates for consumers,  how it would affect the county's environment and whether it would cause  SDG&amp;E jobs to be eliminated in San Diego.  </P> <P> Opponents glumly regard the merger as promising only to foul San Diego County  with everything that's evil about Los Angeles, with its pell-mell development  and pollution.  </P> <P> But most North County city governments, for a variety of reasons, aren't quite  willing yet to embrace that characterization of the merger, and the issue  surely hasn't aroused the public. "Usually the people are very good about  talking with me when something is on their mind," said Vista Mayor Gloria  McClellan. "There just hasn't been much interest expressed." Her comment was  echoed throughout North County.  </P> <P> One reason the merger hasn't stirred much emotion is that San Diego is often  seen as having a separate political reality from North County, where smaller  cities face the crush of their own local problems.  </P> <P> Vista, population 61,000, is chiefly worried about school crowding. Oceanside,  with 107,000 people, is grappling with street gangs, growth and downtown  redevelopment. Poway, 41,000, is struggling against outside-generated traffic  congestion to keep its rural image. And so on.  </P> <P> Solana Beach Mayor Marion Dodson said of the utility merger: "There seems to be  a lot of apathy. It's not a city issue. We have other, more local issues."  </P> <P> Of course, O'Connor has a fundamentally different opinion on the merger's  countywide significance. Downey, the mayor's spokesman, said "the people in  North County will be affected as adversely as the people in San Diego. They  have a large stake in this. There's the likelihood of increased rates,  increased pollution and loss of local control."  </P> <P> Yet another perspective comes from Larry O'Donnell Jr., chief spokesman for San  Diegans for the Merger.  </P> <P> "North County feels it's growing and has its own set of problems," he said.  "The city of San Diego is kind of like a big brother that sits there and tries  to speak on behalf of the entire county."  </P> <P> However, enemies of the merger who want to keep local control by holding fast  to SDG&amp;E labor under a rather general dislike for the utility company,  which alienated many customers by dramatically raising rates during the 1970s.  Although energy bills are lower now, SDG&amp;E is still known as having some of  the highest rates in the country.  </P> <P> Carlsbad's Lewis said "SDG&amp;E has had a bad record. During the crunch of the  70s, we were paying more for energy than any other utility around. They've got  a poor management record."  </P> <P> Encinitas Mayor Pam Slater complained that "SDG&amp;E has suffered from some  mismanagement. I feel we're paying way in excess of what we should be paying."  Yet she might not be happier with a merger, arguing that any non publicly-owned  utility "is a monopoly and an opportunity for the public to be ripped off. And  we have been ripped off."  </P> <P> SDG&amp;E's rates have fostered among some North County politicians a  willingness to at least hear what Edison would offer through a merger and not  dismiss the utility simply because it is identified with the Los Angeles area.  As Escondido's Mayor Thurston put it: "I'm not as sensitive to the big city as  some people are."  </P> <P> There are exceptions to that view, such as Del Mar Mayor Brooke Eisenberg,  whose council hasn't voted whether to actually oppose the merger but has  "voiced some strong concern" over fear that "we would become an appendage in  the Southern California Edison conglomerate."  </P> <P> For the most part, though, North County government leaders are inundated with  facts from organizations on both sides of the merger question, and few local  politicians know what to believe. Slater said, "We've (council members)  individually been given a barrage of paper to read."  </P> <P> If nothing else, that has created much ambiguity about the merger and a desire  among North County's cities to do little or nothing politically until an  objective party completes findings on the proposal.  </P> <P> "Right now, the jury's still out on the facts," said Poway Deputy Mayor Jan  Goldsmith. "We all expressed a desire to receive facts from an independent  source. . . . A lot of these issues are beyond the smaller cities."  </P> <P> Thus, some cities have placed a high premium on research undertaken by the  Public Utilities Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The  cities' delay in political involvement until more is known suits O'Donnell  fine. "If San Diego is so upset," he said, "why aren't the North County cities  so upset? Because they're acting correctly."  </P></p>

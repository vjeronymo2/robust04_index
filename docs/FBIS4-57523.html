			<p>BFN     [Text] The changes at the Attorney General's Office [PGR]  are linked to the results of the struggle against drug  trafficking. Of the four attorney generals who have left their  post, three have fallen into disgrace. They were fired for  their inability to fight drug trafficking and only one of them,  Jorge Carpizo McGregor, obtained positive results. This served  to promote him to a higher position: government secretary.    In a PGR analysis of the administrations of the four  attorney  generals this institution has had and is expected of the fifth  appointed in this six-year administration, it is noted that  Carpizo McGregor was the one who achieved the greatest control  of the PGR. He controlled "up to 35 percent," the remainder (65  percent) was controlled by the large drug trafficking  organizations and the territories they managed.    Of the other three attorney generals, Enrique Alvarez del  Castillo was considered the most negligent. He never established  any type of control of the PGR. During his administration, the  drug cartels appointed and removed government officials. During  Ignacio Morales Lechuga's administration, up to 15 percent was  under his control, although he was forced to resign when that  control dropped to 5 percent.    During Carpizo's administration, control of the PGR rose to  35 percent, while during Diego Valades' administration, control  was lost once again as he surrounded himself with officials who  had "dubious" backgrounds. The percentage of control fell to 10.    Humberto Benitez Trevino, the fifth attorney general, to a  certain extent has been appointed to direct blows against drug  trafficking, but his main concern is the electoral problems and  the crimes that may arise.  <H5>  First Attorney General </H5>   1 December 1988 to 21 May 1991.    Enrique Alvarez del Castillo, former Jalisco governor, was  appointed attorney general by President Carlos Salinas. He took  over the post on 1 December 1988.    Without any control of the PGR, Alvarez del Castillo  delegated the PGR's main duties to Javier Coello Trejo, who he  appointed deputy attorney general in charge of combating drug  trafficking. According to the PGR analysis, Coello Trejo gave  support to cartel "A" in Tamaulipas led by Juan Garcia Abrego  which competed with cartel "B" in the Pacific, led by Armando  Carrillo Fuentes. In addition to the above, Coello Trejo and  his police officers acted with impunity. The cases of rapes and  kidnappings of women in which his officers were involved damaged  even further his image.    From 1989 to 1990, the drug-trafficking heyday continued  until the murder of Norma Corona, the president of the Human  Rights Commission of Sinaloa, on 21 May 1990. Citizens'  pressure forced Salinas to organize a National Commission for  Human Rights (CNDH).    Salinas placed Jorge Carpizo, former president of the  National Autonomous University of Mexico, at the helm of the  CNDH. Salinas was forced to give total support to Carpizo.  This in turn resulted in the fall of Alvarez del Castillo, who  had lost control of the PGR, and Coello Trejo on 21 May 1991.  <H5>  Second Attorney General </H5>   22 May 1991 to 4 January 1993.    Ignacio Morales Lechuga, the new attorney general, appointed  Jorge Carrillo Olea to replace Coello Trejo. He was not  appointed as deputy attorney general, however, but as  coordinator in the struggle against drug trafficking. The new  coordinator's struggle against drug trafficking took off until  it confronted Hector Palma, alias "El Guero," who was engaged in  a struggle with capo Miguel Felix. This resulted in a shoot out  and a massacre among drug traffickers in Sinaloa and Tijuana,  territories controlled by these gangs.    At the same time, a confrontation took place between "El  Chapo" Guzman and the Arrellano Felix gang when the former  entered the heroin market in addition to stealing three cocaine  shipments from the Arellano Felix gang.    During Morales Lechuga's administration attempts were  initiated to reduce capo Garcia Abrego's influence in the PGR,  given that in the previous administration under Alvarez del  Castillo, Garcia Abrego designated deputy district attorneys,  delegates to the states, and distributed large sums of money.    Although during Morales Lechuga's administration there was  an  attempt to reduce the drug cartels' influence, Garcia Abrego  influenced PGR decisions at the highest levels, Arellano Felix  at the mid-level, and Amado Carrillo at the lower level.   <H5>    Third Prosecutor </H5>   5 January 1993 to 10 January 1994    When Jorge Carpizo initiated his administration at the PGR,  he left Carrillo Olea at the forefront of the struggle against  drugs. Nevertheless, from day one it was noted that Carpizo  would not follow in the steps of Ignacio Morales. He started by  taking control of his office and learning the PGR reality, which  he began to control.    "With Carpizo at the helm, none of the PGR officials budged,  they all walked a straight line -- at least that was the  appearance. At any time, a special investigation group could  surprise them and if any irregularity was uncovered they lost  their jobs or they ended up in jail. This instilled fear in  many of the officials," remarked one of the sources consulted.    Everything went well for Carpizo until 1 January 1994 when  the insurrection took place in Chiapas. Beginning in January, a  "witch hunt and repression" was initiated in all the nation's  police institutions as a result of this armed conflict.    At that time, from the Center of National Security at the  Government Secretariat, Fernandez de Villar attempted to involve  Carpizo in this "witch hunt and repression." The attorney  general, however, cleverly pointed out that the PGR had nothing  to do with the Chiapas conflict, therefore, it was not its  responsibility.  <H5>  Fourth Attorney General </H5>   11 January 1994 to 13 May 1994    Diego Valades, who came from the Federal District  Prosecutor's Office, came to the PGR with the mission and with  the same line of conduct as Carpizo. Nevertheless, Valades'  problem was that he sought political posts with greater  responsibility such as Queretaro Governor or a seat on the  Supreme Court of Justice. This took up his time as well as much  of the push Carpizo gave to the PGR. The PGR began to fall by  the way side.    Valades appointed to his work team deputy attorney generals  who were publicly questioned for being corrupt such as Rene  Gonzalez de la Vega and Alfonso Cabrera. Moreover, he made  important changes in PGR representatives at several  institutions; this allowed drug trafficking to blossom.    In addition to this, Valades made a mistake when he  attempted  to present new charges against Mario Aburto, Luis Donaldo  Colosio's murderer, for "false testimony." Aburto had never  declared he was telling the truth before any judicial authority.  Valdes also made a mistake by fighting the National Action  Party team that governs Baja California, while he conducted  operations and made statements that placed the PGR's legality in  doubt.    This attorney general felt a great deal of pressure and  anger, first because a Special Prosecutor's Office was not  created for the Colosio case, and second for the creation of the  National Public Security Coordinator, headed by Arsenio Farell.  <H5>  Fifth Prosecutor </H5>   14 May 1994 to ?    Humberto Benitez Trevino took over the post of attorney  general on Saturday. His main challenge is not the struggle  against drug trafficking, rather it will be to combat electoral  crimes.</p>

			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Optimism lifts Dow in light trading Wall Street US stock markets continued to advance along a broad front yesterday amid mounting optimism about the outlook for the economy, although trading volume was light, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At 2pm, when the market closed early because of the long Thanksgiving holiday weekend, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 15.94 at 3,282.20, its highest point since mid-September. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500, meanwhile, finished 0.97 at 430.16, at another all-time high. The Amex composite index rose 0.51 to 393.39, while the Nasdaq composite rose 1.16 to 649.49, a new record high. Turnover on the New York SE was 106m shares, while rises outpaced declines by 959 to 647. Many participants extended the Thanksgiving holiday, but there was enough of a follow-through of buying from earlier in the week to help share prices post strong gains, although late profit-taking took 10 points off the Dow in the final half-hour. Investors are feeling more positive about the economy every day, and in the wake of Tuesday and Wednesday's promising numbers on GDP, consumer confidence and big-ticket factory orders, came more good news in the shape of a 1.0 per cent rise in personal income and a 0.7 per cent rise in personal spending for October. Both numbers bode well for the economic recovery, which appears to be gathering pace. Although the figures depressed Treasury market sentiment - the benchmark 30-year government issue closed down  21/32 , yielding 7.590 per cent - the rise in bond yields did not upset equities. Among individual stocks, blue-chips were mostly higher. IBM rose Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 65 7/8 , Merck put on Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 45 7/8 , International Paper firmed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 64 5/8 , Du Pont climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 47 5/8 and Caterpillar rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 54 1/4 . Transportation stocks expected to benefit from increased economic activity were also in demand, with airlines leading the way. AMR, parent of American Airlines, rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 64 3/8 , Delta climbed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 52 3/4 and UAL added Dollars 1 at Dollars 120 7/8 . USAir was the exception, easing Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 12 7/8 . On the Nasdaq market, Ohio Bancorp surged Dollars 4 1/4 , or 16 per cent, to Dollars 30 1/4 on the news that the banking group is in takeover talks. Canada TORONTO stocks ended higher, buoyed by gains in Canadian gold and bank shares. The composite index rose 4.3 points or 0.13 per cent to 3,276.5 on volume of 32.1m shares valued at CDollars 290m, compared to turnover of 25.9m on Thursday.</p>

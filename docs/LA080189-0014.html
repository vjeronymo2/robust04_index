			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Comedian Rodney Dangerfield will get no respect from the musicians' union in  Las Vegas. Dangerfield opens at Bally's tonight, despite a strike by musicians  who are angry that many Vegas showrooms rely on taped music rather than on live  performers. Connie Francis will also go ahead with her scheduled six-day stand  at Bally's. The hotel-casino is trying to find a non-union band to replace the  strikers. The union went on strike last week, prompting singer Dean Martin to  cancel his engagement in the Celebrity Room. DANIEL CERONE  </P></p>

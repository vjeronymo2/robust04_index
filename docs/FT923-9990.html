			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Arts: Old Masters lead the way to normality - A year in which tradition - and sanity - returned to the auction houses / Saleroom THE MOST expensive work of art sold at auction in London, in the UK, indeed in the world, in the saleroom season now ending was an Old Master painting. Canaletto's broad sweep of the Horseguards in St James's Park in 1749, which Christie's sold for the Harris family, who had owned it for more than two centuries, went to composer Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber for Pounds 10.13m. The second most expensive work disposed of in the UK, also at Christie's, was another Old Master, Titian's 'Venus and Adonis', which the experts decided was mainly in the hand of the Master rather than his studio. It went, via Christie's and the Earls of Normanton, to the Getty Museum for Pounds 7.4m. And the third most costly work? Well, yet another Old Master, Rembrandt's portrait of Johannes Uyttenbogaert, which Sotheby's sold, for Lord Rosebery, to an American collector for Pounds 4.18m. What could more vividly sum up the transformation in the art market than the fact that three Old Master paintings, all from English aristocratic collections, made the top prices in the auction room in 1991-92? The rout, at least temporarily, of the Impressionists, and of 20th century art, of classic cars and of the abstract expressionist artists of the 1950s, is complete. The auction world has returned to its traditional ways, where connoisseurs rule and established works of art hold pride of place. Christie's reports that Old Master sales rose 23 per cent this season and furniture by 18 per cent. For Sotheby's, jewels were the biggest market - followed by Old Masters. But this return to accepted standards is not totally good news for the salerooms. In the heady days of the late 1980s and early 1990 the speculative bubble in the Impressionists, headed by Japanese buying, pushed art prices (and saleroom profits) to unprecedented heights - Dollars 82.5m (Pounds 43.1m) was paid for a Van Gogh; Dollars 78.1m for a Renoir. With the disappearance of such prices for post-1870 art the annual sales of Sotheby's and Christie's have slumped and they have to work hard to make a profit. This week they announced their results for the 1991-92 season. Sotheby's registered a worldwide decline in sales during the year of 15 per cent in dollar terms to Dollars 1.14bn (Pounds 640m), while Christie's was 8 per cent lower at Pounds 609m (Dollars 1.082bn). The falls at least showed a levelling off on a year ago when both salerooms announced a reduction in turnover during the 1990-91 season of approaching 60 per cent. The art market has now accepted that it is in for a long, hard haul out of recession. Christopher Davidge, managing director of Christie's, admits that he anticipates two seasons of modest growth. But there are clear signs that the worst is over. Both Sotheby's and Christie's report that sales in the first six months of this year show a 6 per cent improvement over 1991. This is the kind of growth that the auction houses anticipate in the immediate future. In a business where confidence is vitally important, the two auction houses are skilled at finding patches of blue sky. For a start, sellers have finally accepted that the market is in the doldrums and that, to dispose of their works of art, they must lower price expectations and reserves. As a result the number of lots left unsold globally this season has remained the same, at around 23 per cent at Sotheby's and 25 per cent at Christie's (although Christie's in London has done much better, reducing its unsold lots by 5 per cent during the season to 17.5 per cent). The basic problem for the salerooms remains the reluctance of owners to risk disposing of important masterpieces at auction during a flat market - unless the demands of Lloyd's of London, or business failures, command otherwise. What Sotheby's and Christie's need is a succession of substantial deceased estates, consisting of works of art of undoubted brilliance, and heirs desperate to raise some money. Sotheby's has actually just secured one. The death of the Prince of Thurn und Taxis in Bavaria has forced his widow to cash in some of the family's amazing art collection to meet death duties. The first, of three, auctions - consisting of jewels, silver and works of art - will be held at Geneva in November. Sotheby's is tempting buyers with very conservative estimates, and at least Pounds 8m should be raised. Michael Ainslie, chief executive of Sotheby's, hopes that this auction, which seems certain of success, will be the trigger to restore much-needed confidence to the art market. Sotheby's needs a lift. It has found conditions marginally harder in the past season than Christie's, which got its cost reductions in first with a wave of redundancies in December 1990 and is currently trading at a small profit. Sotheby's has had its triumphs - the collection of Jaime Ortiz-Patino raised Dollars 29.4m; a Faberge Egg sold for Dollars 3.2m; there was a record for a carpet when a Louis XVI Savonnerie made Dollars 1.2m; and the Dollars 2.8m paid for a painting by Diego Rivera was the second highest price for a Latin American painting. But Christie's, thanks mainly to its century-old links with the owners of Old Masters paintings and its success with English furniture (especially the Messer collection, which brought in Pounds 7.7m), marginally increased its market share. It claims 49 per cent, a 1 per cent gain on the season and its highest share against Sotheby's since the mid 1950s. It has inflated its figures by including private treaty sales, in particular the Pounds 10m it secured by selling Holbein's 'Lady with a squirrel' to the National Gallery. Even so it probably made a minor inroad and certainly heads Sotheby's in the UK and Europe. But market share is less important than market size. While the recession extends its grip on the world there will be no substantial improvement in the fortunes of the salerooms. Speculative buying has disappeared, and antique dealers faced with unsold stock are, in markets such as 20th century art and furniture, taking a back seat to private buyers. Both Sotheby's and Christie's have reduced their payrolls this year, frozen salaries, and had a blitz on printing and office costs. Christie's senior directors are still enduring a 20 per cent cut in their salaries, but at least the company seems safe from takeover bids. Sotheby's has attracted more speculation since its owner, Alf Taubman, decided to sell 8m shares this summer. Phillips, third in size among the British auction houses, did well by achieving sales of Pounds 85.3m and registering a fall of only 3 per cent. It was helped by the emergence of private buyers who out-bid the moribund trade. Bonhams, fourth in size, did even better, managing growth of 2.3 per cent to Pounds 22.12m. and actually recording a gain of 14 per cent in the first six months of 1992, thanks mainly to private buying. Indeed, all the auction houses are looking towards the collector to provide the limited growth they anticipate in the new season, which gets under way seriously in October. It will be a hard grind but, with the worst probably behind them, the auction houses can try and forget the wonder years between 1987 and 1990 and return to the slow but steady expansion, linked to the world economy, which characterised the trade in the past.</p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANCICH LEADS TUSTIN PAST UNIVERSITY, 14-10  </P> <P> Powered by fullback Visko Ancich's 143 yards, Tustin High School (7-3 overall,  4-1 league) earned sole possession of second place in the Sea View League and a  Southern Section playoff berth with a 14-10 victory over University High School  (2-8, 0-5) Friday night.  </P> <P> The Tillers scored first when quarterback Andy Borza hit Chad Smith with a  22-yard touchdown pass after Tustin recovered a Trojan fumble at its own 47.  </P> <P> University tied the score, 7-7, when Victor Davis rambled 40 yards for a  touchdown on a screen pass from Brian Vail early in the second quarter.  </P> <P> Then Ancich broke loose for a 66-yard run that set up a Borza one-yard  touchdown run, giving the Tillers a 14-7 edge, but the Trojans answered with a  22-yard David Jacobson field goal to make it 14-10 just before the half.  </P> <P> Tustin could not relax until University failed to score on a fourth and goal on  the Tiller seven with 2:30 left. The Tillers stopped Jerry Apana at the three  on a short pass, denying the Trojans their first league victory of the year.  MICHAEL ITAGAKI  </P></p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / The Finance Bill: Drowning in a sea of paper - The need to modernise the way tax law is made 'The one certainty about our tax system is that what the government gives, it must first take away. The archaic ritual by which parliament decides how this shall be done is about as appropriate to a modern industrial democracy as tally sticks to the international money market. We need radical reform of our machinery for tax legislation. Only then will the legislation itself become intelligent and intelligible. As long as we continue to worship in accordance with established rites at the altar of the annual Finance Bill, so long will our laws be confused and confusing.' Sir Geoffrey Howe made this rousing call for reform in January 1977. A couple of years later he was back in office and chancellor of the exchequer, a post he held from 1979 to 1983. Once established in Number 11 Downing Street he took no action to restructure the process by which tax law is made in the UK. Nor, despite sporadic reforms of the tax system, has any of his successors. As a result, the tax system is less intelligent and intelligible than it was in the late 1970s. Even professional tax consultants, who profit from the obscurity of the law, admit to being exasperated at the complexity of the UK's tax legislation. They also complain about the volume of it: 3,338 pages of new law enacted between 1975 and 1989. Some taxes were abolished during the course of the Thatcher administration - for example Capital Transfer Tax - but this was more than compensated for by a succession of voluminous Finance Acts. 'But for the efficiency of the tax publishing firms in producing materials that annually update the tax legislation, the majority of tax practitioners would not even begin to cope with the recent volume of legislation,' reflects Malcolm Gammie, a tax partner in Linklaters &amp; Paines, in a discussion document on tax reform first published last year and to be re-issued later this year.* Every tax partner has his or her favourite complaint about the tax system. Adam Broke, formerly head of tax at Ernst &amp; Young, wishes that the Inland Revenue would stop trying to make distinctions between income and capital. Andrew Jones, Broke's successor at Ernst &amp; Young, objects to the arbitrary pigeon-holing of different types of income. Mr Gammie notes that basic tax concepts such as 'income', 'trade' or 'disposal', are not defined. All are agreed that one central cause of the complexity is the way in which tax legislation is enacted by means of the Finance Bill, the 'archaic ritual' identified by Sir Geoffrey in 1977. The process works as follows: proposals are worked up in great secrecy and announced in broad terms in the Budget; about a month later a Finance Bill is published containing the detailed legislation. This is debated in committee at the House of Commons and enacted in the summer. 'Through the Finance Bill process, parliament performs the important constitutional role of allowing the opposition to oppose what government proposes,' says Mr Gammie in his discussion paper. 'It is, however, largely ineffective as a body designed to scrutinise the detail of new legislation . . . Measures which are inherently complicated or require the active involvement of taxpayers to be implemented successfully, require more detailed examination than the current Budget and Finance Bill process allows.' As Sir Geoffrey put it: 'There now follows the by-now-traditional struggle on the Finance Bill Standing Committee. Both sides arrange themselves in adversary relationship, with the opposition attacking the Treasury and the Treasury defending . . . . The minister often feels no compunction about glossing over questions which are beyond him, and the government backbenchers often require little more assurance on a moot point than a promise which trips lightly off the financial secretary's tongue 'to look at the matter again.'' 'Technical material is thus enacted through a parliamentary process where the politicians are not interested in anything but knockabout point scoring,' says Roger White, head of tax at KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock. 'Let's face it, there is no political will to get a better tax system. There are no votes in it.' Another problem is that MPs have no opportunity to influence tax policy: pre-Budget secrecy ensures that there is, in most cases, no consultation over tax proposals. MPs are up against a tight timetable and there are no independent parliamentary experts to help them with the details. The only advice comes from people outside parliament who have axes to grind. Personal Equity Plans (Peps) were first introduced in the 1986 budget, Mr Gammie says, without the benefit of a formal consultation process. Peps were substantially modified in the 1989 budget, reflecting 'a failure to achieve the objectives of the original proposal'. This is but one example of tax law which has had to be rewritten in the light of experience. In more complex areas, tax advisers are forced to rely on the Revenue adopting a pragmatic approach to enforcement. A huge volume of case law has sprung up to give interpretation on difficult points. Mr Jones at Ernst &amp; Young says that, in an ideal world, tax law would be codified and amendments would be made by inserting a new paragraph or schedule into the relevant section of the code, rather than by a reference in one Finance Act to a previous Finance Act. Echoing some of Mr Gammie's conclusions, Mr White makes three proposals for reform. First, he argues that the Revenue should consult more widely and more frequently. Second, he believes that the Budget proposals should be split into two pieces of legislation, one covering tax rates and allowances and the other containing the detailed tax proposals (the technical bill would not have to be enacted until October). Third, he believes there should be a formal tax advisory committee - consisting of lawyers, accountants and industrialists - which could debate the Revenue's proposals before they are published in the form of a bill. The Revenue is getting keener on consultation: last month it published consultative documents on, among other issues, UK trusts, the taxation of foreign exchange gains and losses and the taxation of subcontractors. But other reforms are unlikely. The way tax is implemented now may be tiresome to specialists but it is convenient for the government: huge pieces of legislation can be ushered on to the statute book speedily and with the minimum of fuss. The arcane ritual looks set to continue for some time. *The Process of Tax Reform in the United Kingdom; published by the Law Society of England &amp; Wales.</p>

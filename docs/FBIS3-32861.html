			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Elena, 14 Feb (AFP) -- Visibly exhausted by  the Army's persecution and "sick and tired of war," Nicaragua's  main rebel group announced today that it is willing to begin  disarmament talks immediately and without political conditions.    The leaders of the 3-80 Northern Front (FN 3-80) proposed a  meeting to be held today, Monday, with a peace commission that  would be made up of representatives of the church and the  International Commission of Support and Verification of the OAS.  Recontra leader Elvin Talavera, alias "Chacalin," told the press  that the rebels had accepted a peace proposal by the church and  writer Pantonio Cuadra and that they are willing to negotiate on  the basis of that document.    The plan, disclosed more than a week ago, suggests the  demobilization of the so-called "recontras" but does not mention  any of the political demands the recontras have made since they  took up their weapons against the government.    The unconventional forces are respecting the cease-fire they  unilaterally declared 10 days ago, even though on Friday a group  killed two soldiers and injured three others when they ambushed  a military vehicle in Buena Vista, 8 km from a big military  base. The Army has also refrained from conducting military  operations in the northern area of the country and has announced  that they do not wish to hinder the efforts being made toward  disarmament. Therefore, they will not take reprisals for the  attack.    Chacalin, whom the Army reported as having been killed a  week  ago, said that the group is willing to talk but that the  presence of the soldiers in that area "could hinder" the process.    To date, the recontras have not mentioned any political  demands in exchange for disarming and have only asked that their  safety be ensured. A few months ago, the rebels demanded the  resignation of President Violeta Chamorro and Presidency  Minister Antonio Lacayo and the removal Humberto Ortega,  commander in chief of the Sandinist People's Army.    Regarding their former demands, Chacalin said that "we are  thinking about the upcoming elections (in 1996); we must head  for a civic struggle." Chacalin hinted that there is a  possibility that the group will join the recently formed  Nicaraguan Resistance Party (PRN). The PRN is formed by former  contras who, several years ago, chose the civic way of struggle.    Another FN 3-80 leader known by his alias, "Martin Negro,"  told AFP that they will ask the government to establish new  safety zones to which the Army will not have access. If the  government agrees to these demands, "the meetings will continue"  to discuss other points in the proposal that includes the  creation of another peace commission, Martin Negro said.</p>

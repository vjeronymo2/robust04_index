			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Doubt raised on Sizewell C timing NUCLEAR ELECTRIC, the state-owned generating company, has applied to demolish a dock next to the site of the proposed Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk, suggesting that an application to build the Pounds 3.5bn plant is still some way off. The Pounds 6m dock was built three years ago to handle large loads for the construction of Sizewell B. Nuclear Electric was hoping to use it when the proposed twin-reactor Sizewell C plant was built. In the continuing absence of permission from the Department of Trade and Industry to submit a planning application for Sizewell C, officials have bowed to local pressure to demolish the dock, which is causing erosion of Sizewell beach. The local authority fears that in the long term the effects could be felt further along the coast. Nuclear Electric had hoped to receive permission to submit a planning application for Sizewell C after the coal review earlier this year. Editorial comment, Page 23</p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / International Company News: Pepsi-Cola unit links with NZ brewer PEPSI-COLA International, part of the US PepsiCo group, is to form a joint venture with Lion Nathan, the New Zealand brewer, to produce, distribute and market PepsiCo soft drinks in Australia and New Zealand, the companies announced yesterday. The joint venture would have combined sales of more than NZDollars 200m (USDollars 107.5m) in a highly competitive market. Lion Nathan, the biggest liquor group in Australasia, has been the sole producer of Pepsi products in Australia since 1990. The venture will also incorporate the New Zealand operations owned by Pepsi. It will be 83 per cent owned by Lion Nathan and 17 per cent by Pepsi. The companies said the equity stakes reflected the values of their respective businesses. The venture will be managed by Lion Nathan, which last year had sales of more than NZDollars 2bn. Mr Douglas Myers, chief executive of Lion Nathan, said his company had invested heavily in the Australian soft drink market, and recently opened a ADollars 50m (USDollars 35.7m) facility in Sydney.</p>

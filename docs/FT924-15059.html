			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Buthelezi in secession threat: Tensions fuelled after talks pull-out CHIEF Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of South Africa's KwaZulu black 'homeland', yesterday threatened to secede from South Africa, further raising the political temperature following his decision last week to pull out of talks on a post-apartheid constitution. In a speech at a meeting with two other homeland leaders and ultra-right wing white political leaders, Chief Buthelezi stressed that secession would be what he called 'the ultimate extremity of political action'. But he added that such an extreme action might be 'foisted' on him if negotiations failed. His threat adds to the tension caused by the renewed crisis in negotiations, with the Zulu leader issuing increasingly heated attacks on the African National Congress (ANC) and the government, which he accuses of reaching agreements which ignore the wishes of other parties to the negotiations. Yesterday's meeting was called to discuss this complaint. Chief Buthelezi and Mr Lucas Mangope, leader of the Bophuthatswana homeland, both said they might pull out of negotiations permanently unless they and other leaders were given more say. Mr Mangope has made clear in the past that he prefers to remain outside a post-apartheid South Africa, and would consider re-incorporation only if the new South Africa is a federal state with very strong regional governments. 'We say no to any further appeasement of the ANC,' Chief Buthelezi told the meeting. The parties said they did not plan a formal alliance, but wanted to signal to Mr F W de Klerk, the president, that they would work together to thwart any further agreements between the ANC and Pretoria. Over the past 10 days western diplomats have been pressuring government and the ANC to take action to appease Chief Buthelezi and bring him back into the negotiations.</p>

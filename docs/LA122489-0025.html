			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASTIMES: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> JAPANESE FLOWER ARRANGING  </P> <P> THE TRADITIONAL EUROPEAN or American recipe for floral design is fairly simple:  Buy or pick some posies, plunk them into a vase, move them around a little and  maybe add some greenery. Depending on the colors and varieties of flowers and  the type of container, this can be as simple as a daisy in a beer bottle or as  elaborate as those 7-foot multifloral behemoths in some nouvelle restaurants.  </P> <P> An integral part of holidays and other festivities since ancient times, flowers  are not merely decorative. Greeks and Romans worked up wreaths and garlands to  mark victories, later Europeans danced around Maypoles, and even today no  self-respecting bride would exchange vows without flowers. Whether a  celebration of the seasons or an appreciation of nature's beauty, flower  arranging is more popular today than ever before. Although fresh flowers are  still the overwhelming favorite, dried and silk flowers are blooming in more  and more places.  </P> <P> In contrast to the Europeans' exuberance, Japanese flower arranging, or  Ikebana, is more sculptural. Texture and overall shape, such as the triangle or  three-point design, are important, and variations of styles are distinct  categories -- cascading Moribana, for instance, or trailing informal Seika. A  perfect flower or two, an upright stalk, a fleshy leaf, a low-slung ceramic pot  and the essential pin holder (for supporting leaves and blooms) are the usual  raw materials.  </P> <P> There is nothing casual about these restrained arrangements; they clearly  announce the time, training and art involved. In Japan, flower arranging was  originally practiced only by priests and nobles; like the tea ceremony, sand  painting and incense burning, flower arranging remains a ritual layered with  meaning.  </P> <P>  Instructors in many kinds of flower arranging are plentiful in Southern  California. Kayoko Maekawa teaches Sangetsu flower arranging at MOA (through  UCLA Extension); she describes Sangetsu as emphasizing "the nature of the  plants, bringing out their own beauty."  </P> <P>  Japanese and other kinds of flower-arranging classes are frequently offered by  the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum in Arcadia (Ikebana -- Japanese  Flower Arranging starts Jan. 12) and South Coast Botanic Garden in Palos Verdes  Peninsula; a course titled Flower Design and Arranging is offered by  Everywoman's Village in Van Nuys; Silk and Dried-Flower Arranging for All  Seasons is available at Piecemakers Country Store in Costa Mesa, and The Art of  Silk Floral Design is offered by The Learning Tree in Chatsworth.  </P> <P>  Shunsui Kamimura in San Pedro regularly schedules classes, as does the Elva  May Florist School in Fullerton (the latter a $1,250 Monday-through-Friday  four- week program for would-be commercial florists).  </P> <P>  Some of the many gorgeous and useful books on flower arranging include "The  Book of Fresh Flowers," by Malcolm Hillier (Simon and Schuster); "Designing  With Flowers," by Tricia Guild (Crown Publishers); "Ikebana," by Haru  Reischauer (out of print), and "Flower Arrangement the Ikebana Way," by Minobu  Ohi, et. al., edited and prefaced by Dr. William C. Steere (C. E. Tuttle).  </P></p>

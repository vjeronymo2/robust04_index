			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council, along with Shaykh  'Abd-al- Majid al-Zandani, member of the Presidential Council,  met yesterday evening with several representative dignitaries,  notables, and social figures from the Yafi' District in the  Lahij Governorate. [passage omitted]    The brother chairman of the Presidential Council spoke at  the  meeting, expressing his thanks and gratitude for the high  national unionist spirit demonstrated by the sons of Yafi'  District, the heroic strugglers who have shown true belonging to  the homeland and faith in unity. He noted that the secessionist  rebels, led by the traitor and agent al-Bid, have imposed  challenges on unity by their plots and pursuit of their  destructive selfish interests.    He said the broad national support for the Armed Forces,  which are defending unity and legitimacy, demonstrated by the  sons of the Yemeni people all over the Yemeni homeland, is a  sincere expression of the meaning of unity for our people.  Unity means pride, dignity, existence, and the fate for all  Yemenis. It is not possible to imagine the present and future  of Yemen without unity. The masses of our people have zealously  and eagerly stood up for unity to bolster it, baptizing it with  the pure blood and the precious sacrifices of the sons of our  people and their Armed Forces in order to preserve and maintain  unity.    He added that unity deserves all sacrifices. Our people are  willing to make more sacrifices and they will defend their  unity, even if they have to use stones if weapons are not  available. They will uphold the slogan of unity or death.    The brother president praised the stands of the sons of the  Yafi' District, who have valiantly confronted the gang of  secession and rebellion and defeated it in more than one  location. The sons of Yafi' have proven to be strong strugglers  who are loyal to principles and to the homeland's causes and  unity.    He said our people are today formulating a new history in  their life and effort to make a prosperous, stable future which  cannot be imagined without unity. He pointed out that our  struggling Yemeni people, who have been hardened by experience,  have championed their will all along and are today capable of  defeating this new challenge imposed by the criminal  secessionist gang on unity. The Yemeni people will emerge  victorious, God willing, because the will of the people derives  from the will of God. He said all efforts will be mobilized in  the next stage to repair and reconstruct what has been destroyed  by the war imposed by the secessionists on the homeland and to  build a new Yemen based on unity, democracy, comprehensive  development, broad popular participation, building modern  institutions, establishing law and order, respecting human  rights and social justice.    The meeting was attended by brother Yahya al-Ra'i, member of  the House of Representatives.</p>

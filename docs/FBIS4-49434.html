			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 5 (XINHUA) -- A draft law on China's  emerging real estate business was submitted to the Standing  Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation  today.    The Law on Urban Real Estate Management (draft), on which  officials and experts have worked for six years, is expected to  provide the legal basis for real estate development and make it  a pillar of the national economy.    The draft contains 79 articles in seven chapters governing  use of land for real estate development, housing property  development, real estate trading, registration of real estate  property rights and other subjects.    In explaining the draft to the NPC Standing Committee, Vice  Minister of Construction Ye Rutang noted the rapid expansion of  real estate development in recent years.    "But a host of problems cry for resolution, and provision of  a legal base is the fundamental solution," the official said.    According to the draft, transfer of land shall, in most  cases, be executed through auction or bidding.    Under specific circumstances, however, land may be  transferred through negotiated agreement with approval of the  State Council or a higher level authority of the local  government with the power to approve such matters.    The draft specifies that land for construction of  commercial,  tourist and reactional facilities as well as villas shall be  transferred through auction or bidding.    According to statistics available to XINHUA, of the total  amount of land obtained for construction between early 1992 and  July 1993, bidding was employed for only 0.78 percent and  auction for another 0.32 percent.    The rest was obtained either by administrative allocations  or  through negotiated agreement.    To uphold the state monopoly over urban land, the draft  stipulates that transfer of land shall conform to the overall  planning for use of land and urban development and be  incorporated with the construction of specific projects.    The land developer, says the draft, must abide by the  contractual terms for the development project on the land and  within the contractual period for the development.    With regard to advance sales of housing property, the draft,  apparently to prevent profiteering speculation, prohibits  transfer of housing already sold but not yet finished and  occupied.</p>

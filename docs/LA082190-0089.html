			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH FORMALLY WARNS OF BUDGET CUTS ON OCT. 1;  </P> <P> DEFICIT: NOTIFICATION OF GRAMM-RUDMAN SLASHES PUTS PRESSURE ON NEGOTIATORS.  ANALYSTS SEE THE MOVE AS SYMBOLIC.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration formally served notice that it will have to impose  mandatory budget cuts in many key federal programs starting Oct. 1 unless White  House and congressional negotiators reach agreement on a budget accord.  </P> <P> The Office of Management and Budget warned that, in order to avoid such cuts,  the budget deficit must be reduced by between $85.4 billion and $105.7 billion  -- a figure that is $35 billion to $55 billion more than negotiators have  publicly said is politically feasible.  </P> <P> Bush is expected to sign a cutback order Saturday that will direct federal  agencies to begin preparing for the mandated reductions. The action would not  affect Social Security and other basic entitlement programs.  </P> <P> Analysts say that, at this point, the move is mainly symbolic. In reality, both  the budget negotiators and Congress have plenty of room to maneuver if they  decide to cut spending further, raise taxes or simply abandon the targets set  by the Gramm-Rudman budget law.  </P> <P> But the action intensifies pressure on the negotiators, who already are being  faced with soaring costs stemming from the Middle East crisis.  </P> <P> The White House warnings were bolstered by a companion report compiled by the  Congressional Budget Office showing that a cut of $101.2 billion is required to  meet the Gramm-Rudman target, which calls for reducing the deficit to $64  billion.  </P> <P> Monday's report by OMB provided a detailed analysis of how spending will be  reduced in each government department; it calls for cuts of 32.4% in  non-defense programs and 35.3% in military spending, excluding personnel costs.  </P> <P> President Bush earlier exempted personnel costs from the Gramm-Rudman automatic  cuts in order to avoid putting spending pressures on the Pentagon's deployment  of troops to the Middle East.  </P> <P> If the automatic cuts reached the maximum $105.7-billion level, about $52.8  billion would be slashed from non-exempted defense programs, and $52.8 billion  would be cut from the scant 28% of domestic programs that are not exempt from  the required reductions.  </P> <P> The $85.4-billion figure represents the cutbacks that would be needed from  appropriations already passed by Congress. The higher figure of $105.7 billion  reflects what the total would be if the lawmakers provided full funding for all  the programs they have authorized.  </P> <P> Under the law, 72% of total government spending, including Social Security  benefits, would be exempted from mandatory cuts. Medicare benefits could be  reduced by up to 2%.  </P> <P> Budget Director Richard G. Darman said the Administration hopes to avoid  imposition of automatic cuts, but he again criticized Congress for failing to  work with the White House to reach an agreement.  </P> <P> "Absent responsible congressional action, sequester (the automatic cuts) will  go into effect -- as required by law," Darman said in a statement.  </P> <P> But other Administration officials and congressional staff members said that  the budget-cutting threat was mostly symbolic, because the increased cost of  coping with the Middle East crisis has forced both the White House and Congress  to rethink their budget projections.  </P> <P> White House and congressional negotiators have agreed that the deficit should  only be reduced by $50 billion in 1991, effectively diluting the official  Gramm-Rudman targets.  </P> <P> At the same time, analysts say the combination of the U.S. military deployment  in Saudi Arabia and the impact of higher oil prices stemming from Iraq's  invasion of Kuwait now will make even that lower deficit-reduction figure more  difficult to attain.  </P> <P> Congressional staff members said the crisis may force Congress to find a way to  circumvent the Gramm-Rudman process in September, perhaps by altering the  budget targets, in order to give the government breathing room during the  confrontation with Iraq.  </P> <P> If Congress were to change -- or temporarily suspend -- the Gramm-Rudman  targets, the automatic cutbacks would not be required.  </P> <P> Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), one of the authors of the Gramm-Rudman legislation,  conceded Monday in an interview that the lawmakers most likely would take some  action to rescind the cuts once they went into effect.  </P> <P> "No one contemplates keeping these kinds of (mandated) cuts in place for a  year," he said.  </P> <P> Gramm conceded that the whole budget-cutting debate will be thrown out if  "shooting starts" in the Middle East. "Then the (automatic budget cuts) stop  being a credible threat to Congress, and people who oppose them will use that  to find a way around them," he said.  </P> <P> Yet, even if Congress takes no action before Oct. 1, the effect of Saturday's  presidential budget-cutting order would still be limited if a new budget  agreement can be hammered out by Oct. 15, the final deadline under the current  Gramm-Rudman process.  </P> <P> If an accord were reached by then, federal agencies would be able to avoid  layoffs and other cost-cutting measures by using funds allocated for the rest  of the year, thus making up for any loss of funds in early October, budget  experts said.  </P></p>

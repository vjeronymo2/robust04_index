			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / British Gas gets go-ahead to discount prices for industry British Gas was freed yesterday from regulatory restraints which have allowed its competitors to seize 84 per cent of the Pounds 1.1bn a year market for large industrial customers. Ofgas, the industry regulator, decided to suspend the requirement that British Gas sell to large industrial and commercial customers - those using 25,000 therms a year or more - at its published prices, a rule that did not allow for any discounting. The requirement lifted yesterday was imposed in 1989 as part of the government's efforts to introduce competition into the gas market. Independent companies, operating with minimal overheads and using British Gas pipelines, were quickly able to take a large market share by offering discounts of 10 per cent-20 per cent below British Gas prices. The suspension of the regulation will run for six months from October 1, during which time Ofgas will also conduct a regulatory review of the entire gas contract market above 2,500 therms. Ofgas said yesterday the suspension was dependent on British Gas's maintaining a 'non-discriminatory' pricing policy. It said any evidence that the company was selling gas at 'broadly below cost', or using predatory pricing to win back market share, might result in the reimposition of price schedules. Ofgas held out the prospect that similar restraints on British Gas in other market segments might be lifted at the end of the review. Those restrictions may be replaced with a general requirement that the company should not discriminate in pricing. Ofgas has ordered British Gas to reduce its share of the contract market above 2,500 therms a year to 55 per cent by 1995 to encourage competition. The company has asked for the early lifting of all price restrictions, saying that its share of the contract market had fallen to 47 per cent. But Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general, said the company's dominant share in other market segments made it 'premature to lift those schedules at this time'. Many of British Gas's competitors expressed doubts about the ability of Ofgas to police an unrestricted market. Mr Norman Ellis, managing director of Kinetica, a joint venture between PowerGen and the US oil company Conoco, accused Ofgas of being 'short-sighted' in allowing British Gas to compete freely in the commercial market for guaranteed supplies while the independents were still barred from competing in the residential market. He said the move would depress already thin profit margins in the commercial market and might cause some independents to reconsider their commitment to the UK gas market. He added that squeezing the independents 'won't give our shareholders confidence to make the investment decisions that need to be taken' to prepare for the phased opening of the domestic market in 1996. British Gas welcomed the Ofgas decision and said it 'looked forward to the removal of all other regulatory restraints as soon as possible'.</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: Alcan losses rise to Dollars 56m in final period ALCAN Aluminium, faced with continuing low ingot and fabricated products prices, lost USDollars 56m, or 29 cents a share, in the final quarter of 1992, against a loss of Dollars 36m, or 18 cents, a year earlier. Revenues were Dollars 1.86bn, little changed from the 1991 period. For all of 1992, Alcan's loss was Dollars 112m, or 60 cents, against a loss of Dollars 36m, or 25 cents, in 1991. Revenues were Dollars 7.6bn against Dollars 7.7bn. The figures were struck after preferred share dividends. The 1992 loss included special environmental and rationalisation charges of Dollars 58m, up slightly from 1991. Mr David Morton, chairman, said the results did not reflect the strength of demand, particularly later in 1992.</p>

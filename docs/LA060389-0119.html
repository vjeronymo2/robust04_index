			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AGOURA TO FACE BIG BEAR FOR SOFTBALL TITLE  </P> <P> When Coach Linda Moule took over as Agoura High softball coach last year, she  inherited a team that had won only one game in the two previous seasons.  </P> <P> Moule, who coached the Chargers' junior varsity in 1987, has since turned the  program around.  </P> <P> Agoura tied Santa Paula for the Frontier League championship in 1988 and won  the title outright this year with a 9-0 league record. The Chargers last won  the league crown in 1978.  </P> <P> Now Agoura (22-2), which had never survived the first round of the Southern  Section playoffs, will play for the 1-A Division championship. The Chargers,  winners of 19 in a row after starting the season 3-2, will play second-seeded  Big Bear at 2:30 p.m. Saturday at Mayfair Park in Lakewood.  </P> <P> Because they lack experience in a major tournament championship, the Chargers  are slightly numb to the feeling.  </P> <P> "I know they're excited," Moule said. "But I don't think the real meaning of it  has hit them yet."  </P> <P> The realization should have sunk in Tuesday when Agoura eliminated top-seeded  Paraclete, 10-3, in a semifinal. Big Bear defeated St. Bonaventure, 5-1, in the  other semifinal.  </P> <P> Big Bear (22-3) is no stranger to postseason play. The defending Small Schools  Division champion is making its fifth consecutive playoff appearance.  </P> <P> Agoura (22-2), the fourth-seeded team, will rely on pitcher Melissa Thatcher --  the Frontier League's most valuable player -- in its attempt to dethrone Big  Bear.  </P> <P> Thatcher (22-2), who has an earned-run average of 0.56 and averages six  strikeouts a game, threw a four-hitter and struck out four against Paraclete.  The sophomore right-hander is a low-ball pitcher who gets a lot of outs on  ground balls.  </P> <P> Big Bear, the De Anza League champion, will counter with starter Marjie Sievers  (20-3), who has struck out 199 of the 547 batters she has faced this season.  </P> <P> The Chargers are led by catcher Lisa Little, the only senior on the team and,  according to her coach, a sound defensive player. "We haven't had very many  people steal against us this year," Moule said, adding that at 6-foot-1 she  blocks the plate well. "If she puts her shoulder down, you can forget it."  </P> <P> Little (.430 batting average) Jill Hartwig (.380) and Leslie North (.400) are  the team's top batters. Wendy Baertschiger had three hits against Paraclete.  </P> <P> Big Bear's Chelcee Clifton, Coach Mike Clifton's daughter, is batting a  team-high .635 and has five home runs. She is also the team leader in runs  batted in (39) and runs scored (40).  </P></p>

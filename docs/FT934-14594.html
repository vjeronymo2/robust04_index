			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Strong third quarter for Lockheed LOCKHEED, the US aerospace contractor, lifted third-quarter net profit to Dollars 117m, or Dollars 1.85 a share, from Dollars 86m, or Dollars 1.40, in the corresponding period last year, agencies report. This brings net profit for nine months to Dollars 287m, or Dollars 4.57 a share, which compares with a loss of Dollars 402m, or Dollars 6.48, in the same period of 1992. Last year's figures, however, reflect a significant accounting charge: net earnings before the charge equalled Dollars 3.69 a share. Nine-month revenues increased to Dollars 9.33bn from Dollars 7.18bn, with the third quarter generating Dollars 3.47bn against Dollars 2.47bn. The latest quarter's figures include a gain of about Dollars 90m on settlement of the P-7A navy aircraft dispute, partly offset by changes of about Dollars 75m for the discontinuance of certain operations.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak by Dobrochna </F> Kedzierska, Marek Krol, and Boguslaw Mazur under the "WPROST  Conversations" rubric; place and date not given: "Teamwork"]    [Text] [WPROST] There is a strong coalition behind your  Cabinet, Mr. Prime Minister, but the social perception is that  there continues to be no stabilization. What is the reason for  that?    [Pawlak] First of all, the reason is the kind of approach to  the issue that you are demonstrating here. Almost any situation  can be interpreted in a way that would confirm someone's  preconceived notion. I think that, if one takes a look at the  facts, one can see that there are no signs of the instability  you mentioned. Sure, we have plenty of interesting situations  and difficult dilemmas, but I do not think there is any big  danger to the functioning of the state. Economic indicators  confirm unequivocally that the economy is developing very  smoothly. Take, for instance, the figures regarding price  increases for the first quarter, which are the best in seven  years, and we have also reported a major increase in output. We  should conduct politics in a determined manner, and often times  in a way that would be attractive and interesting to voters and  journalists, provided economic stability is not interfered with.    [WPROST] Given that the situation in parliament is optimal,  why is that not reflected in a clarity of political arrangements?    [Pawlak] Every country has its own interesting events that  make it possible for journalists to discuss interesting topics  and to predict various scenarios of how the situation may  develop. But, if you take a look at specific problems, then, in  my view, society does not feel any special kind of anxiety over  the fact that some terribly unstable situation has just emerged,  even though, indeed, there are a lot of issues stirring up  emotions, such as the issue of appointing a deputy prime  minister for economic affairs, or what has been happening on the  stock market, even though, in the latter case, it does not  affect a large part of society. In the case of the stock  market, it turned out in practice that the "bag" out of which  enterprises wanted to gain capital for their ventures is empty,  and that all that happens at the stock market is that money is  shuffled from one place to another: Some sell and others buy,  but the actual amount of capital is seriously limited.    [WPROST] You said the people have no reason to feel anxious.  How do you manage without a finance minister and a deputy prime  minister for economic affairs?    [Pawlak] As I have said many times before, coalition rules  are about teamwork, and the condition of the team as a whole  counts. For the moment, we are lacking a "forward left" on the  "field," but that does not change the fact that our team has  scored some very good results. Among the practical successes,  the following can be listed, which will remain so in the future:  the restructuring of our debts incurred with the London Club,  and a second stage of debt reduction with the Paris Club. These  are not spectacular events, but they remain important to the  economy and investors alike. I am talking about that here  because what smacks of sensation from a journalist's viewpoint  does not necessarily have to be reflected in the functioning of  the economy right away.    [WPROST] But sometimes such sensationalist issues are  reflected in social life, such as through threatened strikes or  disputes surrounding the so-called neopopiwek  [salary-controlling] law. Your position on the latter issue is  not clear to the public at large. So, does Poland need  salary-control mechanisms?    [Pawlak] What we need are mechanisms that would protect  economic and social stability. A trilateral commission has been  established that includes representatives of employers, trade  unions, and the government. This creates a chance to define  general parameters concerning salary increases in the economy.  Following the acceptance of the president's veto, one should  think about whether it pays to go back to the "shaky grounds" of  a mechanism that has largely ceased to function anymore, or  whether one should implement changes regarding the merits.  After all, one could travel down a path that would require  responsibility by the trade unions, the managing cadre, and the  government. If it were not for salary-increase pressures, a  possibility would occur for establishing general principles of  shaping salary policies by the trilateral commission, followed  by making them more specific through collective agreements.  Commercialization of the economy is also an important issue, as  well as moving away from a valorization of benefits vis-a-vis  salary increases to a valorization vis-a-vis price increases.    [WPROST] The problem of whether we are, first of all,  supposed to invest or consume, has not been resolved in Poland  yet.    [Pawlak] We have been introducing mechanisms that are  conducive to making investments. Income tax and dividends are  supposed to play that function in enterprises. If some of that  revenue is devoted to investments, another part may be devoted  to salaries, and these regulations should be defined nationwide;  there are enterprises with a structural position on the market  that allows them to separate themselves from situations at the  remaining enterprises. We cannot have a situation where an  expert for maintenance of electronic equipment earns 20 million  zlotys [Z] a month because he just happened to come across a  company with a very good market position, whereas an employee  working in a company manufacturing some extremely complicated  computers, but with a low popiwek basis at the beginning would  earn just Z3 million a month.    [WPROST] You mentioned the responsibility of trade unions,  among others. Do you know for a fact that they will actually be  responsible, or do you just have faith in their reasonable  attitude?    [Pawlak] Fortunately, it is a trait that can be verified in  practice. After a debate in the Council of Ministers, during  which an overwhelming majority of ministers spoke in favor of  introducing salary-controlling mechanisms, I spoke with the  chairmen of more than 10 trade unions. I asked them whether, in  a situation of lack of a statute, the trade unions are capable  of resisting temptations to raise salaries under control. And I  must say that the responses were positive in large majority. I  think trade unions are interested in not destabilizing the  situation in the process of abandoning salary controls. On the  other hand, there have been attempts--for instance, in the  Polish State Railroads--to use the current situation to satisfy  pressures for salary increases. Such cases substantially weaken  my arguments, and they may make it necessary to adopt a law that  would control salaries. The government has spoken out in favor  of the Sejm being able to "suspend" such a law, on a motion by  the Council of Ministers. This would create an opportunity for  trade unions, employers, and the government to act in concert.  Various things may prove necessary in practice.    [WPROST] Aside from conflicts with trade unions, there have  been conflicts among the different power centers. The president  has expressed criticism regarding your decision to conduct  self-governmental elections by saying that you should not have  done it before he vetoes the new electoral law. One may have a  feeling that there is no one main decisionmaking center in  Poland.    [Pawlak] It is much easier to find solutions if we  concentrate on practical problems and not on "positions." The  case of the self-governmental elections shows that there is a  time when one can debate various solutions, but then the time  schedule forces us to make a decision. Postponing those  decisions makes us enter a period where conducting elections  becomes somewhat risky because elections make sense in  June--that is, before vacation season. From that standpoint, it  is important to search for practical solutions to problems  instead of insisting on one's "position."    [WPROST] The previous government was impotent because it did  not have a majority in the Sejm, whereas your government's  activities seem to be blocked by the Belweder.    [Pawlak] Statistics defy such suppositions: A majority of  laws were, in fact, signed by the president. But there are also  cases of some interesting situations, such as the salary-control  law. But I still think the president's veto forced everybody to  think carefully about the new solutions. So it follows that,  when one approaches problems practically, there is no situation  where there would be no positive solution whatsoever. If one  could carry out everything very easily, life would be very  boring indeed.    [WPROST] But can you see any solution with regard to the  government-Belweder relationship?    [Pawlak] So many problems arose that one just had to get rid  of them--and that was what the meeting between the president and  the Democratic Left Alliance Parliamentary Club was all about.    [WPROST] You are talking about teamwork and about successes,  but the opposition accuses you of not having a strategic concept  of leading the country, citing the dispute surrounding the  neopopiwek as an example.    [Pawlak] In that particular case, the opposition fell into  its own trap because it could have acted a little more  responsibly during the vote, and it could not have provided such  a categorical reply. After all, our offer was quite open. But,  when it comes to this government's strategy, it is not one of  imposing decisions on others but one of showing the direction.  I have spoken out many times regarding the main priorities. I  will repeat this once again: If we talk about heading in the  direction of democracy and a social market economy, we are doing  this to guarantee Poland a high-ranking place in the family of  free nations. We are eager to see cultural, intellectual, and  economic development of society and the state. Experience of  recent years demonstrates that a few principles should be  observed. First of all, changes must take place in an  evolutionary manner and without sudden, radical moves. Second,  it is necessary to widen support for the reforms by establishing  mechanisms for active participation by large segments of society  in the processes of change. The third principle is about a need  to make our actions, structures, and procedures rational.  Finally, what is also important is the development of human  capital, broadly speaking. We must create practical  possibilities of investing in technologies elaborated by our  scientists, and a system of investment breaks could serve that  goal. One must also secure economic and social stability. That  makes up the general plan that must be the basis for detailed  actions. We can really gain a strong position and be an  important country in this part of the world. Some big  challenges are ahead of us, but they are not insurmountable for  a country located in the center of Europe, with big intellectual  potential and inhabited by people with imagination.</p>

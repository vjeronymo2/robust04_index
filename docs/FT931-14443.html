			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Conflict With Iraq: Turkey distances itself for US-led attack Turkey yesterday distanced itself from the US-led attack on Iraq, insisting that allied aircraft from the Incirlik air base had acted in self-defence in bombing anti-aircraft installations in northern Iraq, writes John Murray Brown in Ankara. It maintained the mission was part of Operation Provide Comfort, the coalition air umbrella to protect the Kurds north of the 36th parallel. The issue is particularly sensitive for Mr Suleyman Demirel, prime minister, who criticised in opposition Incirlik's use in the Gulf war.</p>

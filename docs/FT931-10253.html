			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Hunting coatings side sold for Pounds 19m HUNTING, the defence, aviation and oil services company, has sold its specialist coatings division to Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, for about Pounds 19m. The sale marks the end of Hunting's attempt to develop a special coatings leg that would reduce group dependence on a declining defence market. Mr Ken Miller, chief executive, said the group had already gone a long way along a better diversification path with the development of its oil services and aviation divisions. Yesterday Hunting added two Houston-based oil service companies at a cost of Pounds 5m. It also announced a Pounds 250,000 purchase from Pirelli of Sekur, an Italian defence company whose products include fuel tanks and rubber components for tracked vehicles. Hunting also said that in December it raised Dollars 50m (Pounds 33m) for a 5-10 year period through a dollar private placement. The announcements come only days after it was awarded a seven year contract to manage the UK government's Atomic Weapons Establishment at four sites including Aldermaston in Berkshire. As a result of the deals, gearing should fall from the 70 per cent level prevailing at the end of December, according to Mr Miller. This was after taking account of additional working capital requirements to fund the AWE contract and the benefit to shareholders funds from a Pounds 10m profit over book value on the sale. The coatings businesses, which trade under the Hammerite name, will be an addition to the Williams stable of consumer building products that include Polycell and Cuprinol. Mr Nigel Rudd, Williams chairman, said the deal was consistent with group policy of buying market leading brands in the consumer building product and fire and safety areas. Hunting shares closed up 13p at 233p.</p>

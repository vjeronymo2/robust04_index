			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOOD ENOUGH TO EAT  </P> <P> Hungry? How about a steak dinner with all the trimmings, followed by a  strawberry sundae piled high with whipped cream? If vinyls, polyurethanes and  resins are to your taste, this is the place for you. Iwasaki Images of America  is a practitioner of the arcane art of food replication: making lifelike  foodstuffs from synthetic materials. Long used in Japan, fake food is  increasingly used in the United States for restaurant displays, film props and  even as novelty gifts. When durability is required, a complete salad bar --  fake right down to the crushed ice -- will look fresh and green into the next  century. The company can create an attractive "menu" from its catalogue of  ready-made items, or it will bake, drill, paint and glue a customized item on  request. Founded 15 years ago in Harry Fujita's garage, Torrance-based Iwasaki  Images counts among its customers Disneyland, Anheuser-Busch, Hickory Farms and  Burger King.  </P></p>

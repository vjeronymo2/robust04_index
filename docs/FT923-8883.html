			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Finance and the Family: Argentine market falters  - At A Glance Prices on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange have fallen sharply over the past six weeks, ending one of the most impressive bull runs in South America. The stock market increased by 396 per cent in 1991 but so far this year, share prices have fallen by 11.2 per cent. In July alone, equities lost one-third of their value, bringing the market's capitalisation down to Dollars 23.35bn, from a peak of Dollars 32.13bn in mid-June. This is despite a good economic background with growth forecast at 6 per cent and low inflation. Observers believe that profit-taking and a political setback for the government when it failed to win a Buenos Aires by-election in June, sparked the downturn.</p>

			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVES  </P> <P> DONIZETTI: "ANNA BOLENA." Joan Sutherland, Susanne Mentzer, Jerry Hadley,  Samuel Ramey; Chorus and Orchestra of Welsh National Opera conducted by Richard  Bonynge. London 421-096-2 (three compact discs). Sutherland is a fit tragic  heroine for Donizetti's inventive dip into bel-canto Elizabethiana. The  Australian soprano still commands an authority that few of her contemporaries  can match -- the extended finale before the beheading is still worth waiting  for -- but the occasional underpitch note and unraveled phrase suggests this  project should have been done a decade ago. Sutherland's unfailingly youthful  colleagues underline her current vocal estate. American mezzo Mentzer brings  fresh tone and a persistent vibrato to Jane Seymour. Hadley proclaims Percy's  ardent sentiments with cultivated tenorial fervor. Ramey is an orotund and  sympathetic Henry VIII. Bonynge accommodates them all, without imposing much  personality on the project. Allan Ulrich  </P></p>

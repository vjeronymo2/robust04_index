			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Abnormals affect Boral figures The acquisition of Sagasco and good results from its core Australian operations helped Boral, the Australian energy and building products group, to a 34.7 per cent increase in profits to ADollars 280.9m (USDollars 207.7m), after tax but before abnormals, in the year to end-June. Earnings per share, again before abnormals, were up by 28.6 per cent to 28.3 cents. Sales rose by 10.2 per cent to ADollars 4.65bn. Large abnormal items severely depressed the bottom-line performance, causing Boral to post profits after tax and abnormals of ADollars 121.8m, down from ADollars 228.9m a year ago. The net abnormal charge was ADollars 159.1m, including a ADollars 121.3m profit on the sale of the Azon businesses, a ADollars 108.8m write-off of goodwill, and a ADollars 140.1m provision for rationalisation and restructuring costs. The abnormal charge means that Boral is dipping into its reserves to pay a dividend of 20 cents a share for the year, with the final being an unchanged 10 cents as promised at the time of the rights issue. Directors added that they were confident the dividend could be maintained, given the significant effect of abnormal items last year. Boral said that its core Australian building products business performed well on the back of the continued strength in the housing industry, as did the much-enlarged energy business. The US and European operations - while showing significantly higher profits than in the previous year - also made unsatisfactory returns, the company said. However, it noted that 'results in the second half do indicate significant improvement is under way'. Boral said trading in the first two months of the current year was ahead of that recorded in the same period of 1993-94 and ahead of budget.</p>

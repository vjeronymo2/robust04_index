			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Sharp losses in S Africa Shares in Johannesburg closed with heavier than expected losses as the firmer financial rand, consolidating gold price and nervousness over world markets discouraged buyers, Reuter reports. Dealers said disillusionment over the gold price was creeping in and, although the undertone was bullish, gold and mining related share prices would continue to drift downwards on profit-taking. The overall index lost 67 to 5,764, the industrial index shed 66 to 6,454 and the gold index was 49 down at 2,356. De Beers was off R3.25 at R105.25 while Anglos shed R5 to R238. Elsewhere Gold Fields fell R3 to R125 and Minorco shed R1.70 to R11.55. Lonrho went against the trend to add 10 cents to R9.30.</p>

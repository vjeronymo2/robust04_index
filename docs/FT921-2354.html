			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Manifestos): More of the same or take Kinnock on trust If the Conservatives lose the election, it will be because of the recession. The manifesto held aloft by Mr John Major yesterday is nothing to do with the case. If Labour wins, it will be because of the recession  - and the anodyne manifesto published by the party yesterday. Take the Conservative manifesto first. Some floating voters may back the friendly team that got us into the fine mess we're in right now, but if they do it will be for fear of Labour, and therefore in spite of the slump. It will not be because of any radical or exciting new construct from the Tories, not even the firm promise to introduce a hedgerow incentive scheme, 'to help preserve hedgerows of particular historic, landscape or wildlife importance'. I have to tell you, Mr Major, that this will not help my hedgerow, which is merely of domestic importance. 'What you see is what you get,' said the prime minister yesterday. He was waving a copy of the Conservative manifesto. 'It's all me,' he added proudly. It is. The cover is an enormous blue print of the smiling face of Mr Major. Put him back in No 10 Downing Street and you will get an intensification of the experience of the past 16 months  - collegiate cabinets, broad grin, Citizen's Charter, and all. Others will vote for change. That means rule by the ex-socialist old lags who promise that they really are reformed this time, honest guv. Such voters are gamblers. They will have to take the Labour programme on trust. The entire Labour campaign is designed to convince waverers that there is nothing to fear from the new model party. If this can be achieved, all the Opposition has to do is wait for the government to defeat itself. Not even Mr Neil Kinnock could have dreamed that the Conservatives would be so diligent in their efforts to auto-destruct. There is, of course a third choice. Monday's Liberal Democrat manifesto does not offer an alternative government, but it does suggest a means of expressing a wish for a more effective political mechanism, such as a coalition. Alas, after the election, the Liberal Democrats will be lucky to command a couple of dozen seats. These could, in certain favourable circumstances, enable Mr Paddy Ashdown to lobby Labour in favour of constitutional reform. But however often you toss a coin, it falls heads or tails more often than it stands on edge. For the moment I say no more of the Lib Dems, whose manifesto is graced by a larger than-life photograph of Mr Ashdown. The Conservative manifesto would sound more radical were it not written under the cold eye of the Treasury. Mr Major has injected a sense of respect for the public services into the mix left behind by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, but he has done so from within the corridors of Whitehall. He has not been mean, but then, unlike Labour, he has no compelling urge to redistribute incomes and/or wealth from rich to poor. He reiterates past undertakings to increase child benefit in line with inflation, raise pensions for the worst-off recipients, and establish a 20 per cent tax band. That is not the end of his 'caring' paragraphs. The Tories' national health service reforms are superior to anything Labour has to offer. They constitute an attempt to bring managerial discipline into a nearly unmanageable undertaking. Labour wants to save that promising scene for the health unions. The tone of Mr Major's manifesto is generally defensive, but then the Conservatives have much to be defensive about. In spite of that, the document contains numerous small but useful ideas, many of which are to be commended. The prime minister's penchant for traditional teaching methods more than compensates for the few lunacies (such as a privatised inspectorate) in his plans for schools. The 'millenium fund', financed from a state lottery, is well designed to catch headlines. The proposed changes in the machinery of government are of intense interest to civil servants. Let me pause here. The phrase 'civil servants' defines the problem. Most of these New Conservative proposals bear the mark of close official scrutiny, earnest debate, submission, withdrawal, drafting and redrafting of papers and eventual compromise. This is a manifesto made by ministers who have forgotten the fear of losing office. That is why I believe that the Tories delude themselves when they say that the effect of their policies will be, in Mr Major's words, to put 'you, and not the government . . . in charge of your life'. The health and education reforms require greater control at the centre, in compensation for the further emasculation of local responsibilities. All the new (or recycled old) initiatives, not least the Citizen's Charter, add as much to ministerial power and patronage as they subtract elsewhere. The proposal to govern London with a cabinet sub-committee is not worthy of discussion. As Labour's Mr Gordon Brown remarked at a recent meeting of Charter 88, the constitutional reform pressure group, 'what the Conservatives offer is 88 charters'. So does Labour, but Mr Kinnock at least throws in a (truncated) programme of constitutional reform, including a Scottish assembly. His party's manifesto, which to his credit has the flags of the four nations of Britain on its cover, is evidence that Labour's fiscal intent is redistributive, while its administrative purpose remains regulatory. It would return the monopoly power over state schools to local authorities. It would destroy the NHS reforms. Competitive tendering would become a last resort. One of the sub-titles in Mr Kinnock's document is 'a government which business can do business with'. It is more likely to be a government which business has to do business with. It will have to pay the minimum wage, accept new employee rights, fork out for training, and answer frequent letters from official bodies. Labour has a better appreciation than do the Tories of the deficiencies of our present governance, but it has not yet fully taken in the message from the east, that ministers really do not know best. None of this is the old socialism. It is the new statism. It is not public ownership, but public control  - control, that is, by officials and ministers. Nationalisation is dead. Long live regulation. Supporters of Mr Kinnock may protest that this is to read more into the Labour manifesto than is really there. Certainly the drafting shows extreme care. Some of the language is positively Thatcherite. 'The only way to defeat inflation . . . is to raise productivity . . . ' The phrases are all either designed to soothe, or to advertise. There will be a new body called British Technology Enterprise, a National Health Initiative, a Health Quality Commission, a Ministry for Women, an Education Standards Commission, a Food Standards Agency . . . the list exceeds the space available here. Voters who take a chance on Labour have to believe that (a) all of this really is harmless tomfoolery while (b) Mr Kinnock and his colleagues will not, should they become ministers, revert to their aspirations of yesteryear. The difficulty is that the only way to find out for sure is to let them demonstrate their innocence while in office. The extent to which there is now a widespread willingness to take such a risk is evidence of just how fed up with the recession erstwhile Tory supporters have become.</p>

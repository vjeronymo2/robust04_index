			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (2): Combination of brains and brawn - Drug discovery, the first phase of pharmaceutical research, is being reshaped by several strong technological forces / Research trends Two of the most powerful factors in pharmaceutical research may seem to be leading in different directions. One is the ability to screen vast numbers of molecules - which may be natural products or synthetic chemicals - ever more rapidly for useful pharmacological activity. The other is the use of computers to design an individual molecule to fit perfectly into a particular biochemical slot, such as a receptor site on an enzyme. There are indeed companies focusing hard on one or other of these approaches. For example, Affymax of Palo Alto, California, has pioneered a technique to make and test millions of new compounds, by putting together peptides from random combinations of amino acids. The pharmaceutical industry is suddenly showing great interest in creating huge 'chemical libraries' of this sort for mass screening. At the other extreme is Agouron, based further south in La Jolla, California. It is a leading exponent of 'rational drug design' by computer. The company says its anti-cancer drug AG-337, now in clinical trials, is the first in the world developed from scratch by computational chemistry, without reference to existing compounds. Agouron designed AG-337 to inhibit thymidylate synthase, an enzyme required by rapidlydividing cancer cells. But most drug companies are combining brains and brawn in their approach to drug discovery, says Dr Trevor Nicholls, European managing director of Amersham Life Science, a UK-based supplier of research tools to the pharmaceutical industry - 'some of our customers are using both approaches in tandem. They look for a good shape to fit a particular receptor, through the principles of rational drug design, and synthesise many molecules with the same general shape. Then they use 'high throughput screening' to find the best of this rationally chosen bunch.' Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo, agrees that the use of chemical libraries in this way has enormous potential - 'if you have a target - if you have identified a receptor or enzyme, you can clone its gene and crystallise the resulting protein. Then you can look at the active site and say: this is the sort of molecule you can fit into it. With chemical libraries, you can make thousands of variants and see whether by iteration you can get a better and better fit. 'You're limited at the moment with chemical libraries - they consist mainly of peptides - but as the technology develops you will be able to make thousands of variations of these molecules instead of needing medicinal chemists to make them. Then the fine tuning would be done by medicinal chemists,' Sir Richard says. Glaxo launched a chemical libraries initiative last year. In the US the company has an ambitious programme to synthesise a million small molecules. In the UK, Glaxo is concentrating on building up chemically diverse collections of organic molecules that might be developed into drugs. Sir Richard says chemical libraries and their associated technologies will enable research chemists to spend less time on the routine aspects of organic synthesis and more on the creative medicinal aspects of chemistry. Meanwhile laboratory automation, together with new techniques such as Amersham's Scintillation Proximity Assay, is rapidly speeding up the rate of screening. 'People are regularly running assays with up to 10,000 samples on a single screening run, which can be completed within a day,' Dr Nicholls says. 'Some companies are now looking to increase that by a factor of 10, for example by mixing several compounds in a single well. If you get a 'hit' in a particular well, you then separate the compounds out and test them individually.' Dr John McCall, executive director of discovery research at Upjohn, says his company is 'now using recombinant technology to screen as many as 12,000 compounds in a day - which used to take 12 to 15 months. That represents one of the biggest revolutions in molecular biology.' Both mass screening and rational drug design share a common underlying technology: genetic engineering. They are feasible because 'recombinant DNA' techniques enable researchers to clone the gene for any protein receptor and transfer it to cells in culture, which then produce large quantities of the pure protein. For screening, the protein is incorporated in an assay which tests whether candidate drugs bind to it. For drug design, X-ray crystallography is used to obtain the protein's precise three-dimensional structure which can then be fed into a computer programmed to carry out molecular modelling. Agouron employs 17 X-ray crystallographers who play a central role in the drug design process. They crystallise not only the pure target protein but also the complex formed when the drug binds to it. Their structures are fed back to the computer scientists, who use the detailed information about the binding site to improve the drug further. So the design process involves an iterative cycle between computer modelling and crystallography. How will drug discovery develop in the future? 'Over the next few years, we're going to see more emphasis on experiments taking place within living cells,' predicts Dr John Maynard, research director of Amersham International. 'You can only examine cellular expression systems by looking at living cells.' Sir Richard Sykes believes that it will become technically possible to improve the structure of candidate drugs in situ, while the molecule is actually attached to the target site, through a process of chemical evolution - 'the long-term potential is to put some sort of evolutionary pressure on the discovery process,' he says. 'For example, if you have an enzyme, by an evolutionary technology you would develop the molecule within the active site. I would think this is the way people are thinking: move away from peptides to small organic molecules and alter them within the active site. In effect you're trying to speed up the process of natural evolution.'</p>

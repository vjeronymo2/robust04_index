			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lucia Domville] </F>   [Text] Mexican Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello and Canadian  Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet have agreed to grant more access  to agricultural products and to increase bilateral trade in  cereals, beef, cattle, and agricultural food products.    In the transportation sector the two governments'  representatives agreed to grant reciprocal access to trucks and  trailers so they may use the facilities and terminals in each  country. Tello and Ouellet recognized commercial drivers'  licenses and reached an agreement on technical cooperation in  the transportation sector.    Minister Ouellet said the conflict in Chiapas will not  prevent an increase in the flow of Canadian investments in  Mexico.    Four topics were discussed within the framework of the 10th  Mexico-Canada Ministerial Meeting: politics, trade,  transportation, and the agrarian-livestock sector.    Regarding trade issues, the government representatives  explored ways to increase the potential of an exchange in assets  within the NAFTA negotiations. The Canadian foreign minister  said his government intends to increase the trade of cereals,  beef, cattle, agricultural products, canned fruits, and other  agricultural food products. Canada exported $771 million to  Mexico in 1992. This represents 37 percent of that country's  sales abroad. This figure would increase to surpass the  $1-billion mark if shipments are included. The export of  Canadian manufactured products to Mexico increased almost 15  percent that year.    Bilateral trade will substantially increase once NAFTA is  implemented. Canada has launched the "Access to North America"  initiative, a trade development program worth $27 million.  Ouellet said his government intends to promote trade with small  and medium- sized Canadian enterprises in the market  opportunities given to that country. Telecommunications,  plastics, machinery, tools, and metal engraving tool companies  operate in Mexico. The same goes for agricultural and  industrial products, particularly processed food and similar  high-quality products, a significant opportunity that the  Mexican market has granted Canadian companies.    Regarding the transportation sector, Communications  Ministers  Douglas Young and Emilio Gamboa signed three memoranda of  agreement to strengthen relations between Canada and Mexico and,  consequently, expedite the flow of merchandise. Young explained  that the three memoranda of agreement called for technical  cooperation in the transportation sector, where Canada offers  great advantages to Mexican transportation companies; reciprocal  access to trucks and trailers for circulation in the two  countries; and, he recognized, the use of Mexican commercial  driving licenses in Canada.    Referring to political issues, Ouellet said they discussed  the situation at the national, regional, and world level. On  the national level they reviewed the problem in Chiapas and he  reviewed reports on those events, and the operation to solve the  conflict. The Canadian foreign minister said his country's  investments will not be negatively affected by an internal  conflict because President Carlos Salinas de Gortari guaranteed  it is a local problem that will be peacefully solved, and human  rights will be fully respected.    The foreign minister said he will take a report from the  National Human Rights Commission, led by Jorge Madrazo, back to  his country so his government may have firsthand knowledge of  the causes and ways to settle the conflict.    Moreover, Manuel Tello said the agreements signed within  this  bilateral framework will strengthen relations between the two  countries; and he said the cultural and education exchange will  be particularly intensified.    At the end of the meeting Tello accepted holding the 11th  ministerial meeting in Canada in 1995.</p>

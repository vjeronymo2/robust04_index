Even a </F> Name"]    [Text] Tbilisi -- The Transcaucasus Border District has  changed its name. It is now called the Caucasus Special Border  District. The change of name reflects the need to pursue a  unified border policy in the Caucasus as a whole. The  district's troop directorate has been relocated from Tbilisi to  Stavropol.    "The directorate of the `Gruziya' troop group of Russian  border troops will function in Tbilisi," Colonel V. Chistousov,  chief of the troop group, said. "None of the units has left the  territory of Georgia, and each of them is continuing to guard  the border in the same structure. I hope that attacks on border  subunits, the taking of motor vehicles, and hostage taking are a  thing of the past and that the attitude toward those who defend  Georgia's interests on the border will change."    During last year alone approximately 100 intruders were  detained by Russian border guards on the Georgian-Turkish  border. But there are no grounds for complacency. Georgian  Security Minister I. Georgadze declared in an interview with the  newspaper SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA that all the preconditions exist  for the republic to be able to become a major transshipment  point for the transit of drugs to Europe and America from Asian  countries.    Tasks of guarding the border are resolved jointly with the  Georgian Border Troops Department. An agreement has been signed  on the procedure for manning the Russian Federation border  troops and for the performance of military service on a  voluntary basis by citizens of Georgia on the republic's  territory. It is planned to draft up to 600 people in the fall.    In the opinion of the chief of the "Gruziya" troop group,  the  agreement will create a favorable basis for forming Georgia's  own border troops.</p>

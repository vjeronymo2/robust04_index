			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone report by Shpetim Roqi from Bucharest] </F>   [Text] Last night Romanian President Ion Iliescu hosted an  official dinner to honor President Berisha at Cotroceni Palace.  In exchanging greetings, both presidents expressed the desire  and goodwill to further develop bilateral relations. Worried  about the situation in the Balkans, both presidents committed  themselves to prevent, through diplomatic policy and dialogue,  the spread of conflict and work for the stability in the region.    This morning President Berisha started his activities with a  visit to a small church, more than 200 years old, in the center  of Bucharest, which for a long time was known as the Albanian  Church, called Dintrozi [as heard] in Romanian.    Addressing the priest of the church, President Berisha said:  I have come here to visit this church, which is a great symbol  for all Albanians, as Archbishop Fan Noli, one of the most  distinguished figures in letters, the church, and the Albanian  political world, addressed his prayers here. I have also come  here because I pray to God to bless Albania and Romania, and  Albanians of Romania, including Viktor Eftimiu, along with many  other Romanian personalities of Albanian origin.    Meanwhile, the daily newspapers of Bucharest and the radio  and television continue to publish and broadcast news on the  visit of President Berisha in Romania. At 1100, Berisha gave an  exclusive interview for Romanian Television. After that, Berisha  held a meeting with Emil Constantinescu, leader of the  Democratic Convention. At this meeting Berisha acquainted his  interlocutor with developments in Albania, stressing the  achievements of the shock therapy and a group of completely  social measures.    Honoring the sublime act of the martyrs of Timisoara,  Berisha  said: They not only gave their lives against Ceausescu's  dictatorship, but they shook the foundations of dictatorship in  Albania and encouraged Albanians to raise and liberate  themselves from it. They will always be honored in Albania.    President Berisha also expressed thanks for the help that is  being given to Albanian students in Romania, as Constantinescu  is rector of the Bucharest University and dean of the Romanian  rectors.    For his part, Mr. Emil Constantinescu said that we in  Romania  need the Albanian experience, as it is more important to know  than the experience in other countries as the United States or  Germany. Our countries have suffered from fierce dictatorships  and the transition started under grave conditions. That is why  we are interested in getting acquainted with the Albanian  experience. Your visit here offers a very good opportunity.    Regarding President Berisha's request for supporting the  Democratic Party membership in the European Democratic Union,  Constantinescu committed himself to render his contribution.  President Berisha also gave an interview for the largest  opposition paper, ROMANIA LIBERA.</p>

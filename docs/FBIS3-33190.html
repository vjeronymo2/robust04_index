			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In Matanzas, over 8,000 people are self-employed  under Decree Law No. 141; 61 percent of these are new requests.  The occupations most requested to date in Matanzas Province are  wagon worker and preparer of light foods -- the latter of which  has been temporarily suspended. Independently of the services  and needs of the Matanzas market that the province's residents  might meet through self-employment, the state budget also  benefits, receiving income of over 0.25 million pesos for new  registrations and almost 5 million pesos in taxes.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (12): Tide may turn on smart devices - 'Personal digital assistants' have not yet caught on The goal of the mobile communications industry is to keep you in touch 'any time, anywhere'. Whether or not this is an attractive proposition, it seems to be the inevitable fate of many professionals in the not-too-distant future. Already, many are toting a bag full of communications gadgets: a cellular telephone, a pager and a notebook computer complete with telephone modem. Combine the functions of these products into a single device and you have a 'personal communicator'. It seemed a sure-fire winner, but so far personal communicator products, also known as 'personal digital assistants', have created more publicity than profits. In fact, they have been a dismal failure. Apple Computer's Newton was the biggest letdown. Heralded as a product that would 'change the way people live and work', it turned out to be a product that changed little except the names of the top management executives at Apple. Tandy's Zoomer and AT&amp;T's Eo Communicator have also been slow sellers. Yet it may be too soon to write off the personal communicator. Advances in wireless data communications and software for personal communicators promise to make the next generation of these hand-held devices far more attractive than the first. Apple Computer is set to introduce a new version of Newton with improved communications capabilities and better handwriting recognition software. AT&amp;T, stung by the disappointing sales of the Eo Communicator, is redesigning the system, lowering the price and transforming it into a mobile telephone with computer features. IBM is said to be planning a family of personal communicator products, each designed for specific tasks. One model, for example, is equipped with voice recognition for dictating notes. Another is designed for sending and receiving electronic mail. Motorola is about to enter the market with a personal communicator called Envoy that has a built-in modem to send data both over telephone lines and over the Ardis network. Jointly owned by Motorola and International Business Machines, Ardis provides wireless data messaging service in all large US metropolitan areas. Sony is also planning to launch a personal communicator in the US this summer. Link Resources, a US market research group, predicts a 45.7 per cent compound annual growth rate in sales of all types of 'smart hand-held devices' over the next five years, with more than 5m units being shipped to business users and consumers in the US in 1998. The second generation of personal communicators will sell well to mobile executives and in the small office and home office markets, Link researchers predict. They anticipate several developments that could turn the tide for this new category of mobile communications devices. Most importantly, the market researchers expect wireless data communications services to proliferate and become less expensive. At present, Ardis, a joint venture of Motorola and IBM, and Ram Mobile Data, owned by BellSouth and RAM Broadcasting, offer wireless data networks in large cities throughout the US. This year new Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD) and enhanced 'specialised mobile radio' (SMR) services - based on the networks being implemented by McCaw Cellular and NexTel - will drive down user costs for wireless voice and data communications, Link Resources predicts. CDPD sends data in packets over cellular networks. 'In the simplest sense, this technology sends blocks of information over the networks by utilising those milliseconds when channels are idle between calls,' said Brian Montgomery, of Cellular One, a California cellular telephone service company that is a joint venture of McCaw Cellular and Pacific Telesis. 'It provides the capability for a cost-effective data service because it doesn't require expanded system capacity.' An important advantage of CDPD is that it is an 'open' standard, developed by a consortium of communication companies including McCaw Cellular Communications and PacTel Cellular, based on non-proprietary technology. This means that unlike existing wireless networks, it will be accessible to anyone with a computer or personal communicator equipped with a CDPD modem and that it can be integrated easily with existing software for applications such as electronic mail. Lotus Development, the personal computer software company, is developing software to take advantage of CDPD networks. NexTel, a little-known six-year-old New Jersey radio dispatch service company, burst on to the scene as a potential new competitor in the emerging market for wireless data communications last year with its acquisition of mobile radio spectrum rights from Motorola. Using digital technology from Motorola, NexTel aims to create a nationwide network offering voice, data and paging as well as its established dispatch services . When low cost wireless data communications services are in place, personal communicators will become really useful devices, enabling people to send or receive written (or typed) messages, access information services or simply use the device as a portable telephone. Another important impetus for personal communicators may be 'intelligent networks' such as AT&amp;T's 'PersonaLink'. Using software developed by General Magic, a California software company in which it holds a stake, AT&amp;T plans to introduce 'PersonaLink' this summer. Among the features of PersonaLink is the ability to prioritise messages. Perhaps more than anything else this may prove to be the 'must have' attraction of personal communicators for people who are overwhelmed with telephone, facsimile and electronic mail messages. Instead of exacerbating this all-too-common problem by creating 'anywhere, anytime' communications, personal communicators may actually therefore help individuals to regain control of their personal communications.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FORECAST PRODUCTION OF 'SMART' HAND-HELD DEVICES ('000 UNITS)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Device              1992   1993    1994    1995    1996    1997    1998  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Organiser            594    586     555     527     448     403     363 Personal agent         0    160     385     539     728   1,019   1,324 Personal communicator  0      9      85     285     675   1,250   2,250 Intelligent electronic   book                 3     19      33      74     135     225     385 Electronic notepad     3      5      17      33      72     135     240 Electronic personal   agent                0      0      35      85     165     275     550  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                600    779   1,110   1,543   2,223   3,307   5,112  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Link Resources  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Fifth of companies cut union recognition ALMOST one in five companies employing more than 1,000 workers have withdrawn union recognition partly or completely over the past five years, research for the Department of Employment shows. A survey for the employment department by researchers at Warwick, Sheffield and Oxford universities found that a quarter of those derecognising unions did so at most or all of their sites. Falling union membership among the workforce was one of the most common reasons employers gave for derecognition, the study of 176 UK and overseas-owned companies says. The full survey is to be published in September by Warwick University's industrial relations research unit. The survey's preliminary findings are reported in this month's issue of Personnel Management Plus, the Institute of Personnel Management's magazine. Of those companies opening at least one new site over the past five years, 59 per cent have not recognised unions. However, of the 82 per cent of companies which reported taking over one or more operating sites as going concerns, more than 90 per cent had maintained union recognition.</p>

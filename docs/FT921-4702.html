			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Collecting: Big names go to Paris in springtime - Nicholas Powell previews the Salon de Mars and the Salon du Dessin and sees plenty to attract interest MARCH and early April traditionally are a quiet time for Paris galleries but dealers and collectors have two big events, the Salon de Mars and the Salon du Dessin, to which they can look forward this year. The fourth annual Salon de Mars will be held as usual under several acres of white canvas on the lawns of the Champs de Mars in Paris, just by the Eiffel Tower, from March 25-30. The often-startling mixture of periods and styles, from pre-Columbian to the avant-garde contemporary which is the salon's trademark, is as pronounced as ever. Last year's event attracted 50,000 people and most serious buying was done by French collectors. Broadly speaking, art priced at under FFr500,000 sold easily but the market proved sluggish above that figure. Highly-priced contemporary art was almost impossible to move but specialists in less-speculative fields, such as art deco and African art, reported good sales. There are 115 stands this year, five fewer than 1991. Some leading Paris dealers, such as medieval specialist Bresset, have preferred to stay away and concentrate instead on the huge Biennale arts fair in September. Twenty-four of this year's dealers have come from abroad, one fewer than in 1991; but only two are American, compared with nine two years ago when the art market still was booming. Although organisers are confident that the reputation of the Salon de Mars is growing outside France, foreign dealers have been put off by their own economic problems and the French government's swingeing increase in value-added tax on art last summer. Although that rate was reduced in December from 18.6 per cent to 5.5 for original art works, - the last of several legislative turnabouts - the news came too late to help the salon. The fair will, nevertheless, have two British exhibitors for the first time: Richard Goedhuis, who deals in Oriental art, and contemporary art specialist Stoppenbach and Delestre. The quality of exhibits at the Salon de Mars has improved radically over the past couple of years and the fair has begun to attract the trade's biggest names such as Paris furniture dealers Perrin, Segoura and Etienne Levy. Levy, who specialises in 20th century French mahogany furniture, is presenting an unusual bookcase with incorporated bottle and cigar racks  - ideal, he says, for 'a selfish, refined bachelor.' A Paris colleague, Jean Gismondi, known best for highly-decorated 17th century Italian furniture, is showing only French Empire furniture in mahogany. The highly-specialised fields will be well represented, too. Gisele Croes, a leading Chinese art specialist from Brussels; Parisian medievalist Jacqueline Boccador; and African arts experts Alain de Monbrison and Helene and Philippe Leloup (also from Paris) all are showing. Presentation at the Salon de Mars is unfussy. At the Salon du Dessin, it is positively austere. The stands are only 45 sq ft, the nondescript beige wall hangings are the cheapest the organisers could find, and the potted plants must be shared. The salon was the first drawings fair in Europe, and the world's first showing only original drawings to the exclusion of prints. It began last year in basement rooms at the Hotel George V and proved so successful it is being repeated from April 1-5. Seventeen Paris dealers again are clubbing together for the show, which is intended to give a further boost to the rapidly-developing Paris market in drawings - and keep the proceeds at home. This year, though, the fair's only contemporary dealer, Marwan Hoss, has dropped out and is replaced by Brame and Lorenceau, who are leading specialists in late-19th century drawings and paintings. This year's salon, like the first, will be top-heavy in French 18th century drawings of the sort the local public likes best (although dealers complain such works are increasingly hard, and ever more expensive, to find). Galerie Cailleux, which probably will have the best in that line, is presenting a special homage to the artist Hubert Robert, with a selection of architectural fantasies and studies of ancient Roman characters. Galerie Proute, one of the city's most learned specialists in drawings and engravings, is showing works by Rodin and Fragonard. Dutch-born dealer Bob Haboldt, who last year had the finest choice of northern European works, is proposing a mix this year with 17th and 18th century French works.</p>

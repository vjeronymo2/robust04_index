			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Art of staying afloat in a cold climate: Assessing the mood of British boatbuilders PEOPLE buy pleasure boats when they are feeling wealthy, says Mr Edwin Paul, and the British are not feeling particularly wealthy at the moment. 'I reckon people have got the cash but not the confidence,' he says. All the same Mr Paul sold five sailing boats on New Year's Day, the first day of the 1992 London International Boat Show at Earl's Court. Last September Mr Paul led a management team to buy Westerly Yachts for Pounds 2.2m after it went into administrative receivership in May last year. Renamed Westerly Yacht Construction, it will sell 80 boats this year, compared with its previous annual average of 250. Doctors are still buying boats, but the owners of cash-strapped small and medium-size companies are not. Mr Peter Thomas, Westerly's sales director, says the decline of the building industry probably means the two bricklayers who bought a yacht two years ago will not be after a bigger boat. Mr Paul Wagstaff, chief executive of the British Marine Industries Federation, insists that Westerly going into receivership was not typical. No more than a handful of the federation's 1,400 member businesses failed last year, he says. Mr Wagstaff says a dearth of British buyers resulted in the turnover of the UK pleasure boat industry falling by up to 20 per cent last year from Pounds 1.36bn in 1990. However, the success of exports, which account for 50 per cent of revenues, has saved it from the shake-out experienced in other sectors. In spite of the UK's decline as a shipbuilding nation, Britain remains surprisingly successful in the manufacture of pleasure boats and related equipment. The 650 exhibitors at Earl's Court, many of them UK-based, will spend the next week showing off everything from navigational aids to streamlined power boats that look as if they would be more at home in space than in the water. Mr Wagstaff says that although the sector employs only 20,000 people, the UK pleasure boat industry vies with that of France for the title of the biggest in Europe. Mr Robert Braithwaite, managing director of Sunseeker International, one of Europe's biggest manufacturers of power boats, says: 'Well, you've got to put the hype out, but everyone's suffering. People who are not exporting are suffering very badly.' Sunseeker has responded to the UK recession by increasing exports from 95 per cent of production to 99 per cent. Continental Europe accounts for 60 per cent of Sunseeker's sales, with the rest divided between North America, the Far East and Japan. 'There's no market that's booming, but we've been working on Japan for four years. There's luck in business and the Japanese market suddenly took off for us,' Mr Braithwaite says. The company has eight months of orders, compared with the 12 months it usually achieved before the recession. 'I'm very pleased to have eight months, I can tell you,' he says. Some smaller, more specialised UK manufacturers have suffered less in the recession. Mr Sean McMillan, managing director of Suffolk-based McMillan Yachts, which makes custom-built wooden boats, expects 1992 to be the first profitable year since he founded the company five years ago. Mr McMillan, a fine-arts graduate from Newcastle University, eschews the industry's move towards computer-aided design, preferring to draw yachts by hand to meet each customer's individual requirements. The average price of his yachts is Pounds 100,000, but they can sell for much more than that. At his Earl's Court stand is a drawing of a 78ft schooner designed for a group of Swiss businessmen. If the deal comes off, Mr McMillan will sell the boat for Pounds 1.5m. He says: 'The recession has affected us only inasmuch as we haven't seen as many UK purchasers as we would have liked. But we've had a comparatively easy time because of the overseas market. In our business you're looking for only half-a-dozen buyers worldwide and they're not difficult to find.' In spite of the lifeline provided by exports, Mr Wagstaff says the industry has worked hard over the past decade to market pleasure boating as an activity which is not confined to the very rich. The cheapest boat on offer at Earl's Court is a 6ft glass-fibre dinghy which sells for Pounds 169 excluding VAT. There are many other boats on display with price tags in the hundreds rather than thousands of pounds. Mr Wagstaff's federation sponsored 16 events in the UK last year at which beginners were encouraged to try their hands at boating. It has also launched a subsidiary called Schools Afloat to tell local education authorities about boating facilities in their area. The federation has targeted other markets. It makes presentations to seminars for the newly-retired. It has also advised its members to be on the look-out for potential customers who have recently inherited money.</p>

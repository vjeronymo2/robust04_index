			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Health row sparks bitter attacks by party leaders THE ELECTION campaign exploded into a bitter row over the health service yesterday after the Conservatives responded to a controversial Labour broadcast with a series of scathing personal attacks on Mr Neil Kinnock. But as the angry exchanges signalled the start of a new, much rougher phase in the campaign, Labour dismissed a move by Mr John Major to discredit the factual basis for the charges in the broadcast of NHS 'underfunding'. A day of insults was followed by two opinion polls last night indicating that Labour has held on to its lead over the Conservatives. An NOP survey for The Independent and BBC Newsnight put Labour three points ahead with its support at 42 per cent, the Tories at 39 per cent and the Liberal Democrats at 14 per cent. Gallup for The Daily Telegraph put Labour at 40.5 per cent, the Tories at 40 per cent and the Liberal Democrats at 16.5 per cent. The statistically unimportant Labour lead of 0.5 points in the Gallup poll compared with a two-point Conservative advantage in a similar survey last week. NOP, however, suggested that Labour's lead had fallen from four points to three points. Some senior ministers believe that if the polls do not begin to move in the Conservatives' direction by the beginning of next week it may be impossible for the party to recover enough ground to win the April 9 election. Their hope, however, is that the fierce attacks on Labour's tax and economic policies, emphasised again in the Conservative election broadcast last night, will begin to percolate through to the voters. The broadcast charged that Labour policies would stifle the prospect of recovery by forcing up inflation, interest rates and taxes. At the heart of the latest bruising exchanges was an emotive Labour film broadcast earlier this week which dramatised the plight of a young girl who had to wait nearly a year for a National Health Service operation. Alongside her it presented another child who was treated immediately in the private sector. As details emerged of the actual case behind the broadcast, the Conservatives launched a fierce attack on Mr Kinnock's honesty and fitness to govern. Remarks by the hospital consultant involved alleging an administrative error and misrepresentation of the facts prompted Mr Major to lead an all-out attack on Mr Kinnock's participation. Speaking at a rally in Edinburgh, the prime minister accused the opposition of having 'no regard for the truth' in its campaigning on the health service. He went on to attack bitterly the Labour leadership: 'I tell you this. Their attitude tells you more about the people who lead the Labour party than it does about the health service. Such men are unfit to govern, such men must never govern.' Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, went further, accusing Mr Kinnock of producing 'sleaze' to trade 'in the misery of families and the pain of little girls to make a political point'. Mr Waldegrave, the health secretary, likened the images to the propaganda in Nazi Germany during the 1930s. But Mr Kinnock fiercely defended the broadcast, arguing that it provided an example of the widespread 'privatisation' caused by the Conservatives underfunding of the health service. Labour then released a letter sent to the parents of the child last month, in which the consultant listed shortages of beds, doctors and nurses as the reason behind the delay in the child's operation. Accusing Mr Patten of 'negative and dishonest' attacks, Mr Jack Cunningham, the Labour party campaign director, said that the broadcast had achieved Labour's objective of putting health at the centre of the election battle. He said that Labour had received 'hundreds' of examples of parents being told they would have to pay for rapid treatment of children.

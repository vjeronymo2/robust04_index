			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Healthcare bill likely to be sent to Congress this week THE Clinton administration will probably send its detailed healthcare reform bill to Congress next week, according to one of its chief architects. Mr Ira Magaziner, White House adviser, said in a speech in Washington yesterday that publication of the bill had been delayed by last-minute number-crunching over new taxes and fees to finance the extension of basic health coverage to all Americans. This delay has offset some of the initial momentum gained from the impressive presentation of the outlines of the package by President Bill Clinton and his wife late last month. Mrs Hillary Clinton has continued to draw favourable reviews as she campaigns around the country on behalf of the plan, which she also played a leading role in shaping. But her husband, and the public, have been distracted by events in Somalia. However, yesterday the president flew down to North Carolina, one of the biggest tobacco producing states, with the apparent intent of at least trying to make the case that it is right and proper to help finance national healthcare reform through the levying of higher 'sin taxes'. The suspicion of some lost momentum was confirmed by the latest Washington Post poll released yesterday. This found public support for the Clinton plan down to 51 per cent from 56 per cent after his speech to Congress, while opposition had risen from 24 per cent to 39 per cent. Most reservations centred on the undoubted fact that people will have to pay more, directly or indirectly, for their medical care and on the fears that its quality, including the freedom to choose doctor and hospital, might decline. Nevertheless, as the White House was quick to point out yesterday, the Post poll still found a comfortable majority (59-31 per cent) believing that the Clinton plan was better than the current system. Even many Republicans concede that reform is essential. The details of the bill, likely to run to over 1,000 pages, will be critical, with countless interest groups some representing indisputably worthy of causes, waiting to pounce.</p>

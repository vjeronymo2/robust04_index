			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / UK Company News: A bimbo with the sweet smell of success - Inspec Group heads for market with Pounds 100m valuation Inspec Group, a speciality chemicals company bought from British Petroleum by a management team for Pounds 40m only 18 months ago, should be valued at over Pounds 100m when it floats on the stock market in the next two months. The flotation is expected to raise about Pounds 50m via a placing of shares combined with either a public offer for sale or an offer through financial intermediaries. Even by the standards of recent management buy-out flotations the investors will have done well. The venture capital backers, led by Advent International, will have seen the value of their investment more than double while the stake held by management and staff, for which they paid around Pounds 600,000, could be valued at over Pounds 15m. That will make it one of the most successful examples of the Bimbo - the increasingly fashionable combination of management buy-in and buy-out. The management is headed by chairman Mr John Hollowood, 58, a former Oxford research fellow who has already made one fortune from speciality chemicals. In 1984 he sold Fine Organics, the drug intermediates business he founded, to Laporte for almost Pounds 8m. He stayed with the company and joined Laporte's acquisitions team before retiring in 1990. 'I played a lot of golf but soon got bored.' Despairing of any improvement in his handicap, he teamed up with Mr Jim Ratcliffe, 41, a chemical engineering graduate who, after a career spanning the London Business School, Esso and Courtaulds, had moved into venture capital with Advent. They started approaching the many large chemical and oil companies which were looking to sell their specialist chemicals subsidiaries. A year later they clinched the BP deal. 'Some people have accused us of being lucky to find this business, but we looked at 25 different companies,' says Mr Ratcliffe, who left Advent to become group managing director of Inspec. However, there is no denying that their timing was fortunate. BP needed cash and was under pressure from the City to speed up its disposal programme. Better still, it was just completing a major restructuring of its fine chemicals arm which included the closure of its site at Carshalton in London and the transfer of production to its other plant at Hythe on Southampton Water. In a successful attempt to return the business to profit BP had invested Pounds 13.7m at Hythe and rationalised both the product line and the workforce. 'We got a very good chemistry set and some very good people,' says Mr Ratcliffe. Eleven of the senior managers joined the buy-out and now 85 per cent of the 150 staff at Hythe own shares. The BP legacy also included some very strong market positions in specialist products such as dimethyl isophthalate (DMIP), a key ingredient for the making of PET plastic bottles. Inspec, the world's biggest manufacturer, has 80 per cent of the growing European DMIP market and is making inroads in east Asia. It is also the world leader in hydroxy monomers which provide the high gloss finish for car paints. Despite its exposure to the motor industry, which provides over a fifth of its sales, and to continental Europe, which accounts for well over half, Inspec has grown strongly since the new team took over. Helped by sterling's devaluation turnover rose by 17 per cent to Pounds 49m in 1993 with operating profit from continued activities up by more than half to Pounds 7m. At 14.3 per cent its operating margins are among the fattest in the sector while its profit per employee of Pounds 41,000 is more than double that of its nearest quoted rival, Allied Colloids. The statistics have improved further following December's Dollars 20m (Pounds 13m) acquisition of Allco Chemical, an American speciality chemicals company which boasts operating margins of 36 per cent. Thanks to its strong trading and modest capital investment needs Inspec managed to fund virtually all the Allco purchase price from cash flow. Most of the funds raised in the flotation, to be handled by merchant bank Morgan Grenfell with brokers Cazenove, will be used to pay off expensive buy-out debt. Freed from that burden the company could contemplate bigger deals, but Mr Hollowood lays more stress on expanding the existing business. 'The easiest way to increase our profits is to fill up our plant at Hythe which is operating at only 67 per cent capacity.' He sees good growth prospects for its newer products such as DMB, a starting material for synthetic musk which provides the 'stay-fresh' smell for detergents. Even Inspec's most mature business, synthetic lubricants, is growing well thanks to the development of new applications. Potentially most exciting are the patented oil-soluble polyethers which, when added to ordinary mineral oil, are claimed to give it the characteristics of totally synthetic engine oils - for half the price. Mr Ratcliffe says that several major oil companies are now testing the product which BP spent Pounds 3m developing. 'If it is successful it could be a very substantial business. We will know in about three years time.'</p>

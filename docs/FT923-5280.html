			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Lloyd's agency in fresh takeover AJ ARCHER HOLDINGS, one of two Lloyd's agency groups listed on the Stock Exchange, yesterday announced that it would continue its expansion by acquiring a fellow agency, Kellett Holdings. Mr Brian Kellett, the owner of Kellett Holdings, is to become chief executive of the new group. Mr Kellett is a prominent non-marine underwriter and a member of the Lloyd's council, the London insurance market's governing body. Last month Archer bought another Lloyd's agency, Cuthbert Heath. The move signals further rationalisation at Lloyd's as businesses seek to reduce costs and improve efficiency after their worst trading losses ever. Pre-tax losses for 1989, which were announced in June, in line with the three-year accounting system of Lloyd's, amounted to Pounds 2.06bn. Chatset, the research company that monitors Lloyd's, forecast last week that losses for 1990 will amount to Pounds 1.5bn. The combined capacity (the capital base) of the syndicates managed by Archer amounts to Pounds 573m, making the agency the second-biggest after Sturge Holdings, whose managed syndicates this year have a combined capacity of Pounds 955.96m. Murray Lawrence has a managed capacity of Pounds 534.46m. Mr Kellett, referring to the rise in premium rates at Lloyd's, said: 'The consolidation of Lloyd's agencies into larger and more economic units will enable us to take advantage of the improving market conditions.' Archer members' agencies will handle the affairs of 663 Names, the individuals whose assets support underwriting. Mr Richard Maylam, chairman of Archer, said that he had been looking at potential acquisition targets since last year. Following the market's difficulties, agencies were 'much more willing to become part of a larger group'. Kellett shareholders will receive 2.25m paid-up Archer shares and a deferred cash consideration as well as profit commissions received by Archer from the Kellett businesses. Kellett net assets amount to about Pounds 640,000. It is proposed, subject to the approval of Lloyd's, that the acquisition will be completed before the end of the year. Other agencies to make acquisitions this year include: Stewart Underwriting (which has taken over the business of Miles Smith), Crowe Underwriting (which has taken over AR Mountain), Castle (which has agreed terms with Edward Williams Coutts &amp; partners) and Cox (which has taken over the business of CW Rome).</p>

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Motor industry joins fast lane: In the last of our series on manufacturing, FT writers find one sector's prospects are improving but in another they are growing bleaker IF THERE is one sector in British manufacturing where there are strong hopes for revival it is the motor industry. The UK is set to be the fastest-growing centre for car production in Europe during the 1990s and the industry is expected to move into trade surplus in the second half of the 1990s. Mr Colin Hope, president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and chairman of T&amp;N, the UK automotive components suppliers, said: 'The prospects are for a doubling of production over the next five years.' Professor Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff Business School, said UK car production could jump to between 2.5m and 2.8m units by the year 2000 from 1.3m last year, with exports rising to between 1.2m and 1.5m from 600,000 last year. He predicted a surplus in the overall trade balance in automotive products in 1996. The motor industry is a good example of the decline of manufacturing in post-war Britain. In the 1970s labour relations were notorious, product quality was often abysmal, management was inadequate and inward-looking, and the attempt to create a national champion in the form of British Leyland was bungled. The motor industry trade balance plunged into the red in 1982 and economic growth in the second half of the 1980s sucked in more imports, while the industry lacked a strong export base to penetrate foreign markets. The deficit swelled to a record Pounds 6.6bn in 1989 - 28 per cent of the UK visible trade deficit. Mr William Ebbert, chairman of Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, said: 'The UK automotive industry has laid firm foundations for a strong future, even though we've still got a long way to go. Britain really does have a great chance to play a leading role in the future of the European motor industry.' By 2000 the UK could have moved 'from fifth to maybe third place in the European industry,' he said. The biggest single force behind the recovery is investment - totalling more than Pounds 2.1bn - by three leading Japanese carmakers, Nissan, Toyota and Honda, although Mr Hope insists that existing vehicle makers and component suppliers are 'playing a full part' in the recovery. Mr Jacques Calvet, the protectionist chairman of Peugeot, the French carmaker, sees the UK as 'a Japanese aircraft carrier' leading the assault by Japanese producers on the traditional carmakers in Europe. By the end of the decade the car industry in Britain, measured by output, will be one-third owned by Japanese makers, one-third owned by US manufacturers and one-third owned by European producers. The UK industry built 1.16m vehicles in 1982 with 315,000 people, including metal parts suppliers. By 1991 output had risen to 1.45m vehicles with a workforce of 216,000, Mr Ebbert says, while motor vehicle exports rose from 327,000 in 1982 to nearly 690,000 in 1991. Mr Ebbert said: 'On most significant criteria our industry today is highly competitive in Europe. The British industry is now delivering quality products reliably, and in European terms, at low costs.' He believed, however, the European motor industry had to 'redouble efforts to lift performance to world-class levels.' The arrival of the Japanese car producers is helping to rejuvenate the automotive components sector. Parts and accessories account for about 45 per cent of UK exports of motor industry products. Japanese component suppliers such as Nippondenso, Calsonic and Sumitomo are producing in the UK, and European suppliers such as Valeo, Robert Bosch and Magneti Marelli have also established a significant presence here. Prof Rhys said that the UK motor industry, with its long-term competitive improvements reinforced by the devaluation of sterling since it left the European exchange rate mechanism in September, was 'well set to survive in the more competitive environment leading up to the new millennium'. The industry that was 'the laughing stock of the 1970s' was experiencing 'renewal and growth'.</p>

[Begin Sarid recording] I am telling you: As far as I am  concerned, the PLO has not yet built confidence. It signed the  agreement, but my impression at this point is that it is not  honoring that signature. Up until now, I have not discerned any  interest on its part in what is happening in the field, and I  find this very disappointing and depressing. [end recording]    Having said that, Minister Sarid went on to assert that a  Palestinian state will definitely be established. According to  him, the establishment of a Palestinian state is an inevitable  natural development.</p>

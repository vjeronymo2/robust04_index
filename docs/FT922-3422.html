			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Court to settle Maxwell claim NATIONAL Westminster Bank yesterday asked the High Court to settle the dispute over the ownership of shares in Teva, an Israeli pharmaceutical company, which are held by the bank as security and are claimed both by the Maxwell pension funds and by the administrator of Robert Maxwell Group, one of the Maxwell private companies. NatWest said if the court decided that beneficial ownership of the shares never passed from the funds managed by Bishopsgate Investment Management to RMG, then it was prepared to relinquish the security and return the shares to the pension funds. If, however, the court ruled that title in the shares passed from BIM and the common investment fund to RMG before being mortgaged to the bank in return for a loan, then it would not return them, because it was a 'bona fide purchaser for value without notice'. The 25m Teva shares, with a value of just less than Pounds 20m, were mortgaged to NatWest as security for a new loan of Dollars 27.3m on November 7 last year after a Maxwell request for new money to meet interest payments due on the MCC 'jumbo facility' used to fund the purchase of Macmillan. The bank said the mortgage was taken in good faith after receiving written assurances that they were beneficially owned by RMG. NatWest asked questions before accepting the mortgage because the certificates were in the name of BIM. It then took a mortgage in the same form from BIM as a guarantee for the RMG mortgage. NatWest said yesterday it was only on December 5, when the Maxwell private companies went into administration, that it was notified by the pension fund managers that the shares might be trust assets. It asked the court to determine the issue because the RMG administrators indicated the shares should not be surrendered to the detriment of other RMG creditors.</p>

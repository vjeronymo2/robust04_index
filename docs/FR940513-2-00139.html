			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any operational difficulties associated with the authorized operations shall be resolved by DRRC/CALM and any other affected party through negotiated agreement, or, if the parties cannot reach agreement, by the Commission. Any initiation of operations by any entity other than DRRC/CALM over the AMR lines shall occur only after approval by the Commission and upon 30-days' notice to the Commission and AMR. This 30-day transition period would apply also to operation commenced pursuant to the Commission's approval of Finance Docket No. 32479.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> We find:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. DRRC/CALM has requested the Commission to permit it to provide continued rail service over those portions of the AMR lines included in the Norman Branch which it determines to be operationally safe.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. To prevent transportation and economic disruptions in this area of Arkansas, and to assure the immediate continued movement of critically needed commodities to adjoining regions of the United States including Louisiana, it is necessary for the Commission to authorize DRRC/CALM to operate over AMR's Norman Branch line including 3 miles of overhead trackage under 49 U.S.C. 11123, conditioned upon a waiver of any compensation from the Federal government and DRRC/CALM's agreement to hold the United States Government and AMR harmless from any claim arising out of the authorized operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or energy conservation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is ordered:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Based upon its undertaking to do so upon the terms and conditions noted herein, DRRC/CALM is authorized under 49 U.S.C. 11123 to enter upon and operate AMR's Norman Branch including 3 miles of overhead trackage rights pursuant to the terms of this service order and its agreements with AMR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Operations by DRRC/CALM on the lines of AMR authorized in this decision may continue provided it gives appropriate notification to the Commission that the lines to be operated remain safe for that operation. Operations by DRRC may continue for 180 days from the effective date of this decision unless it is sooner modified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Operations performed under authority of this order shall conform to the directions and conditions prescribed herein.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. All submissions filed in this proceeding should refer to Service Order No. 1516 and should be sent to the Commission's headquarters at 12th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20423. Any filings made in this proceeding should include an original and 10 copies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The provisions of this decision shall apply to intrastate, interstate, and foreign commerce.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Commission retains jurisdiction to modify, supplement, or reconsider this decision at any time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Notice to the general public of this decision shall be given by publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The decision will be served on the Federal Railroad Administration, the Association of American Railroads, American Short Line Railroad Association, DRRC/CALM, AMR, and UP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. This decision and order shall become effective at 11:59 p.m., on April 27, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Unless otherwise modified by the Commission, this order will expire at 11:59 p.m., on October 24, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> By the Commission, Chairman McDonald, Vice Chairman Phillips, Commissioners Simmons, and Philbin.

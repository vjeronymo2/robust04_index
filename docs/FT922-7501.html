			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Shephard relents on work hours THE government believes it can no longer fend off an agreement on the European Community's controversial working time directive - including the 48-hour ceiling on the working week - at the next social affairs council on June 24. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, will instead be lobbying over the next few weeks for a clause saying that although workers cannot be obliged to work more than 48 hours, they may work over the limit if they choose. That idea was floated at last month's social affairs council, along with the earlier UK proposal that all workers who regularly do more than 48 hours a week should only be allowed to do so if they pass a health 'risk assess ment'. The risk assessment idea has won little sympathy from other EC countries, most of which support the working time directive. Almost 6,500 engineering workers at Britain's largest railway carriage makers will work 38 hours a week from July this year and 37 hours a week from next July, the AEEU engineering union announced today. The union says the deal for Brel workers at York, Derby and Crewe is one of the biggest and best negotiated under its shorter working week campaign.</p>

			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Survey of New Zealand (16): A small nation's sense of self-respect - Sport BY ANY standards, New Zealand is one of the great achievers in world sport. Its roll call of world champions and record holders, now and in the past, is impressive and out of all proportion to what might reasonably be expected from a country of only 3.3m people. Its medal haul at the last few Olympics has been impressive. On a medal per population basis it exceeded that of any other country, putting this small south Pacific nation in the forefront of international sport. It has also achieved great success in non-Olympic sports such as the Whitbread Round the World Yacht Race, where in the last event, after 24,000 gruelling miles, New Zealand yachts fought out an exciting climax to finish first and second. International sports administrators and athletes sometimes ask why such a small country, with a population fewer than many large cities, excels in such a wide variety of sports, both as individuals and in team events. New Zealanders take their sports seriously. When the national rugby team, the All Blacks, were beaten in the semi-final of last year's Rugby World Cup, millions of words were written and hours of television time were devoted to analysing the defeat in minute detail. Retribution was also swift. The selectors, coach, assistant coach, captain and several senior players - all deemed to have let their country down - were dropped. In a few weeks, New Zealanders will vote in a referendum to determine the method of selecting future governments. Fewer than one in 1,000 voters knows the meaning of the referendum alternatives. By contrast, only one in 10,000 does not know that the All Blacks were beaten by Australia by only one point in early July. This means that every child and adult in the country has access to ample facilities in any sport they choose. People of all ages are actively encouraged through government-backed community service TV advertising to 'have a go' and participate in some sporting activity. Other aspects of the New Zealand lifestyle and environment help to encourage sporting prowess. The country's clean air, congenial climate, good quality housing, easy access to beach, bush and countryside, outdoor living and plenty of healthy food - even for the less well-off  - all provide a solid base to encourage and develop sporting ability. The shoreline is the fifth largest in the world. With its numerous natural harbours, lakes and rivers, this is an ideal environment for water sports. The colourful sight of thousands of yachts on the sprawling Auckland harbour on summer weekends has earned it the title of City of Sails. Children aged 10 to 12, in specially designed small yachts, have their own competition races. These help to develop their skill from an early age. At the last two Olympics, New Zealand won several medals in yachting, canoeing, kayaking and sailboard riding. It has been a major competitor in the Whitbread Race and in the America's Cup. One big disadvantage for world class New Zealand sportsmen or teams is distance. To compete in the northern hemisphere or the US where most world championships are staged is costly in time and money. To send the country's equestrian team to the Barcelona Olympics will cost more than NZDollars 250,000 (Pounds 80,000). Teenage girls, members of the hundreds of pony clubs around New Zealand, have contributed to the team's fund-raising. This is one sport in which the country has high hopes of winning a medal. The team includes Mark Todd, a champion rider hoping to gain his third successive gold medal. The cost of sending the full Olympic team of 138 athletes will be more than NZDollars 3m (Pounds 1m). Without financial support, topline individuals or sporting bodies would not be able to compete in international events to the same extent as they do now. Helping to meet some of the costs is the Hillary Commission, a government-appointed body which this year has NZDollars 24m from lottery profits to fund sporting organisations. While some of the funds will help to finance the Olympic team, a considerable amount of money is spread widely to encourage all types of sporting and leisure activity. Each year, hundreds of organisations benefit. Some grants are modest to help local sports club acquire or build better facilities. Grants can range from helping to build a new mountain hut for alpine climbers to providing equipment for a rural softball team. The major objective is to encourage all New Zealanders of all ages to participate in some form of sporting or leisure activity. For continuing sporting success, particularly against larger, wealthier nations, has given New Zealanders confidence and a sense of self-respect.</p>

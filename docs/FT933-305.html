			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hanson retreats Hanson gave up 4 1/2 to 253 1/2 p as turnover rose to 16m, after BZW and SG Warburg reduced profits expectations. In a detailed note on the company, BZW lowered its current year forecast by Pounds 50m to Pounds 1.08bn and trimmed the following year's figure by Pounds 35m to Pounds 1.195bn, to take account of the costs of a strike at Peabody, its US coal operation. The strike started in February. Warburg is believed to have weighed in with a more severe downgrade in profits, trimming its forecast by Pounds 65m to Pounds 1.2bn, for the same reasons. Warburg was reported to have advised investors to switch out of Hanson and into BTR, a stock that has been underperforming the market in recent sessions. The shares climbed 10 1/2 to 371 1/2 p in heavy trade of 9.3m. Talk that Bass may surprise the market with a gloomy statement at a meeting with analysts tomorrow was being heard and the shares drifted back before rallying late in the trading session. They closed steady at 465p. Scottish &amp; Newcastle was hit by renewed rumours that it was negotiating to buy a big part of Grand Metropolitan's Chef and Brewer chain of restaurants and that a large rights issue would be its probable choice of payment. The shares dipped 5 to 470p. However, analysts are still tipping Whitbread, up 5 at 541p, as the favourite to land the 1,500-strong pub and restaurant chain. The emergence of S&amp;N has shifted the secondary spotlight away from Allied-Lyons as a potential Chef and Brewer purchaser and the relief helped the shares gain 10 at 570p. GrandMet basked in positive comments over its restructuring and management changes and the shares rose 15 to 418p. Minorco relinquished 6 to 1229p after announcing an asset swap with its majority shareholders, South African groups Anglo American and De Beers Centenary. The 10 per cent improvement in the dividend at insurance group London &amp; Manchester cheered the market and the shares jumped 16 to 365p. Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank, was reported to have advised investors to switch into Legal &amp; General and out of Prudential Corporation. The former rose 10 to 489p on the advice, while the latter closed 2 ahead at 348p. The recent selling in Sun Alliance appeared to have dried up, leaving the shares to advance 8 to 385p. Among banks, talk that Royal Bank of Scotland was to float off its Direct Line Insurance business returned to the market, helping the shares to firm 3 to 316p. However, leading market watchers dismissed the speculation. The renewed speculation that TSB was at last about to dispose of Hill Samuel, its merchant banking subsidiary, along with further positive recommendations from analysts, saw the shares add 4 1/2 at 221 1/2 p. Hotel group Forte drifted back ahead of results due tomorrow, with NatWest Securities reiterating its sell stance. The shares eased 3 to 237p. Brent Walker felt the fallout from the hefty losses and gloomy outlook announced on Monday, the shares weakening 1 1/2 to 5 1/2 p. First Leisure put on 8 at 276p at the start of a series of presentations by NatWest Securities to institutions in Scotland. Also holding meetings in recent sessions has been Granada, with analysts and institutions being told of steady trading and rosier prospects. Smith New Court, in its latest research note, says: 'Given the ability of Granada to continue to grow earnings even in unhelpful economic circumstances, its rating looks very undemanding.' The shares moved ahead 8 to 448p. A squeeze in Rank Organisation shares sent them scurrying forward 16 to 817p. Thorn EMI, rebuffing press criticism of its Rent-A-Centre business in the US, gained 10 at 941p. Trimming of profits forecasts continued in Hazlewood Foods and the shares lost 3 to 172p. A presentation at BZW by Carlton Communications was said to be a factor in its advance of 19 to 743p. A buy note from James Capel was said to have helped Dixons appreciate 7 to 263p. The agm at Great Universal Stores disappointed stores analysts, who had been hoping for some detail on current trading. The shares, which have galloped in recent sessions, steadied yesterday at 2241p. Profit-taking continued in Next, which slipped 2 to 198p. More talk was heard of good business being done at Marks and Spencer and the stock climbed 7 1/2 to 386 1/2 p. Storehouse shed 2 to 221p, with UBS said to be negative. Talk of disposals at international trading group Inchcape saw the shares add 9 at 531p. Shares in Cookson Group, under pressure at the tail end of last week following a profits downgrading from Smith New Court, rallied 3 1/2 to 194 1/2 p, with Hoare Govett and James Capel said to have been recommending the stock. Andrew Sykes, which tumbled on Monday following a profits warning, bounced up 5 to 80p as bargain hunters moved in. Engineering group Siebe moved forward 10 to 535p after the company confirmed that it was consolidating its business activities into three divisions and making changes in senior management. The company had signalled the changes in recent meetings with analysts. A profits upgrade from Hoare Govett boosted FKI, 5 stronger at 151 1/2 p. The broker only raised the current year forecast by Pounds 1m to Pounds 51m, but improved the following year's figure by Pounds 6m to Pounds 66m. TI Group edged 8 ahead to 343p, with Kleinwort Benson said to be positive on the stock. Drug shares remained under a cloud as Wall Street influences again governed events. Wellcome fell 11 1/2 to 694 1/2 p and Glaxo 13 1/2 to 633p. Waste management group Shanks &amp; McEwan retreated as a number of brokers were said to have cut their profits forecasts. The shares retreated 6 to 169p. Among transport stocks, P&amp;O gave up 8 to 567p, with Smith New Court said to have reiterated its cautious stance. The broker remains concerned about the implications of increased competition on routes across the Channel. Smith also suggested that on a 12-month view the yield had been eroded to no more than the market average.</p>

			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STATE SEN. DEDDEH, IRAQI NATIVE, SUPPORTS BUSH'S MILITARY MOVES IN MIDDLE EAST  </P> <P> Visibly anguished, state Sen. Wadie P. Deddeh (D-Bonita) told his legislative  colleagues Thursday that he backs President Bush's military actions in Iraq but  urged him not to create "further enmity towards the United States in that part  of the world."  </P> <P> After his Senate floor speech, Deddeh, who was born in Iraq, said in an  interview that he's received several telephone threats because of his Iraqi  background, but dismissed them as "crank calls."  </P> <P> Deddeh's remarks came during discussion over a Senate resolution calling on  Californians to conserve energy through car-pooling and fuel-efficient vehicles  to ease the nation's dependence on foreign oil during the current Mideast  confrontation between Iraq and the United States.  </P> <P> "The problem in the Middle East is not going to be contained," said an  emotional Deddeh, who grew up in Iraq before emigrating to America in 1947. He  visited his native country on behalf of the Carter Administration in 1979 and  was under consideration by the Reagan Administration for an ambassadorship to  the Middle East.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately for us in the West, we are identified with the forces that are  trying to stifle the rise of Arab nationalism. This is what concerns me,"  Deddeh said.  </P> <P> "And, while I pray for my President and support him, I hope we will not do  anything that would create further enmity toward the United States in that part  of the world," he said.  </P> <P> Deddeh said he fears for his 300 relatives living in Baghdad, which could be  destroyed "within hours" by American forces. "A lot of innocent people will go,  on both sides, unfortunately," he said.  </P> <P> He also predicted that "a lot of Arab leaders would be destabilized" during the  current crisis. But, despite his misgivings, Deddeh said he was supporting the  resolution and Bush's actions so far. "In times of crisis, there is no  Democrat, there is no Republican. We're all Americans."  </P> <P> After his remarks, Deddeh was publicly commended by Sen. Art Torres (D-Los  Angeles) for expressing himself despite an "incredible number of threats, not  only from his own area but from other parts of the state, because of his  heritage."  </P> <P> After the remarks, Deddeh said he has received a "couple of crank calls from  crackpots and a letter," but declined to discuss them further. "Just let it go  at that. I don't want to escalate it or attract attention to it."  </P></p>

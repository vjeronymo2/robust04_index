			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Query over Pakistan's quiet revolution: Architect of reform hopes Bhutto will safeguard his work BEARDED men in traditional clothes and armed with sophisticated assault rifles stood guard outside the parliament building in Islamabad this week, to protect their powerful tribal leader who was about to take oath as a member. The guards were a stark reminder of the influence of tribal and feudal values in Pakistani politics and the economy, but never before have those values come under such intense pressure as in the past three months. Because of an aggressive campaign of unpopular economic reforms which have tried to clamp down on powerful interests, many Pakistanis are hoping a turnaround will occur in their country's economic fate. The architect of the reform programme has been Mr Moeen Qureshi, the former prime minister, who stepped down on Tuesday after handing over power to Ms Benazir Bhutto. For many Pakistanis looking at the future of their country, the key test for the new government is the extent to which the reforms will survive. By any standard, Mr Qureshi's programme has been as unusual as his own background. His three decades of work experience with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank kept him away from his country as well as its influences. When he was appointed Prime Minister in July he brought a fresh insight to many of the chronic problems which previous governments failed to resolve because of reluctance to confront powerful interests. During his brief tenure, Mr Qureshi moved fast to introduce unpopular measures such as taxing previously immune and politically powerful rich landowners. He also began a large-scale campaign to recover outstanding bank loans and unpaid utility bills, changed the tax collection network to increase government revenues and eliminated special government quotas which allowed elected politicians to allot valuable government land at throwaway prices. He also finalised a three-year tariff reform programme which aims to eliminate at least some of the smuggling activities, estimated to be worth at least Rupees 100bn (Pounds 2.1bn)a year. As a result, for the first time in Pakistan's history, the new government is left with virtually no patronage that could be used to attract new political allies or tame critics. 'The most important reforms aim at good governance. I feel that this country has been run previously by governments that have had almost feudal characteristics. It's not the fault of any particular government, it's the system that has evolved in that way, and public resources, public assets, have been used a means of political patronage,' Mr Qureshi said in an interview. If 'we've got to build a healthy democratic system, then the people must expect that their rulers are in fact their servants rather than their authoritarian rulers,' he added. Mr Qureshi remains hopeful that his programme will remain on course, largely because both Ms Bhutto and Mr Nawaz Sharif - the two front-runners in the electoral race - had assured him they agreed with the broad thrust of the plans. In addition, continuing with the reform programme would allow future governments to benefit from larger revenues while laying the responsibility for unpopular measures on Mr Qureshi's shoulders. The reforms have also been acclaimed by the IMF and the World Bank. One sign of that acknowledgment has been the recent approval of a Dollars 277m (Pounds 183.4m) standby IMF loan. Mr Qureshi is confident the new government can also get up to Dollars 1.2bn in extra IMF funding over the next three years if a commitment is made to keep the reforms on track. Ms Bhutto's government has yet to come out clearly on its future economic policies . Some officials are concerned over her statements on the campaign trail that she would review the new agriculture taxes. But it is not yet clear if such a policy reversal, which may well have been part of the electoral rhetoric, could be made in face of criticism from Pakistan's multilateral and bilateral aid donors. Mr Qureshi hopes public opinion will play an important role in protecting his initiatives. 'I don't think that some of our fundamental reforms, particularly in so far as good governance is concerned, can fall apart, because they are really based on awakening the conscience of the people,' Mr Qureshi declares. 'I believe that the Pakistani public is much more conscious and much more sensitive now about the misuse of power and authority in government and about its use for political purposes.'</p>

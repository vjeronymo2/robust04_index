			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / EC plans Gaza hospital THE European Community yesterday gave Ecu13m (Pounds 9.1m) to build the first substantial new hospital in the Gaza strip since 1967, as part of its growing and controversial Palestinian aid programme in Israel's occupied territories. The 232-bed hospital, to be built under a contract signed yesterday with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), will be near Khan Younis, in the southern part of Gaza. It is intended to help improve what the Brussels Commission claims are deteriorating health conditions among the territory's population of 780,000, most of them Palestinian refugees. The EC has traditionally channelled most of its aid to the occupied territories, amounting to Ecu472m over 1971-91, through UNRWA. But in 1987 it began its own direct aid programme. The Israeli government has allowed an EC official to supervise this, but at Jerusalem's insistence he is based in Brussels. The UNRWA is to give food to Palestinians in Gaza to ease suffering caused by an Israeli ban on most workers entering Israel, Reuter adds from Gaza.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] In Libreville, Gabon, the new cabinet was  formally sworn in yesterday. It is the fourth government since  multiparty politics was instituted in the country in 1990.  [passage omitted]    Concerning this cabinet, let me add that Jean-Francois  Ntoutoume Emane, the man appointed minister of state control and  parastatal reforms, has turned down his appointment. He has  declined Casmir Oye-Mba's offer. What are the reasons for this  turndown? Jean- Francois Ntoutoume Emane spoke a short while  ago with Raphael Mbadinga. As you will hear him pointing out,  his rejection of the post was not a last minute one. He  disclosed his stand to the head of government on 31 March,  adding that he was not consulted before the appointment. Here  is Jean-Francois Ntoutoume Emane.    [Begin Emane recording] I am not an opposition figure. I am  in the presidential majority. I am and will remain a member of  the Gabonese Democratic Party. You are fully aware of  developments in my constituency. I (?proved my worth) by  barring the way to Father Paul Mba Abessole of the National  Lumberjacks Rally in the 1991 parliamentary elections. I did  the same at the last presidential elections in which my  constituency gave the president 15,900 votes, a score second  only to what he obtained in Haut-Ogooue Province.    I believe if they wanted me to return to the government,  they  should have consulted me first. Thereafter, proposals could  have been made to me and I should have been given time to  consider those proposals. Concerning the idea of making me  minister of state control, let me state, first, that I am  against the regionalization and tribalization of ministerial  appointments. For some time now, the state control portfolio  has been held by indigenes of the Estuaire Province. While  offering me the state control portfolio they have taken away its  substance by transferring the parastatals and privatization  portfolios elsewhere. They rather tagged me with the  decentralization portfolio. From the intellectual standpoint, I  would have loved to handle that department but while entrusting  decentralization to me they assigned the local government  portfolio to someone else.    How can you talk about decentralization or promoting a  decentralization policy without enjoying the [words indistinct]  and without a base, which local government areas precisely  happen to be? It means I would find myself constantly at  loggerheads with the minister responsible for local government  areas. I was assigned the territorial development portfolio but  one cannot talk of territorial development or promote  territorial development without a base. They added regional  integration to my tasks but given the present state of the  Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa where [words  indistinct] have not been paid for the past two years, given the  difficulties facing the Economic Community of Central African  States.    The point is not that I am against the composition of the  government but as a Gabonese, I wish all the same that a smaller  government had been formed during this time of crisis. I was a  minister for a long time. For me, it is not a [word indistinct]  to enter the cabinet. Let those who have never been ministers  do so. As far as I am concerned, when one is a minister, one  must be prepared to work but I cannot work in an inconducive  atmosphere with poorly defined functions. I cannot head a  ministry made up of knickknacks, namely a ministry that is  haphazardly constituted. [end recording]</p>

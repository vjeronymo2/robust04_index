			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Yermolin: "Defense Budget, Benefits to </F> Service Members: View of the State Duma"    [Text] On Thursday the Chairman of the Committee of the  State Duma for Budget, Taxes, Banks and Finances Mikhail  Zadornov held a press conference whose main topic was the draft  state budget for 1994. After becoming acquainted with the  supplied materials, the committee concluded that the draft did  not allow for the real dynamics of socioeconomic indices of the  current year. In particular, in January and February the volume  of production dropped not by 9 percent, as planned, but by 24  percent. What is more, the draft did not adhere to the  priorities of economic policy proclaimed in the presidential  message. And finally, a number of documents, without which the  Duma members did not think it possible to accept responsibility  for adopting such a budget, had not been submitted. The  committee will recommend to the Duma that it take into  consideration the budget report of the Government of the Russian  Federation and continue work only after the described  deficiencies had been corrected.    Regarding the defense budget, all factions without exception  are talking about it today. And in particular the leader of the  "Vybor Rossii" [Choice of Russia] faction Yegor Gaydar has his  own opinion about military expenditures. Responding to a  question from a KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent, he stressed that  the faction will favor the adoption of that version of the  defense budget which was submitted today by the government of  the Russian Federation. As Gaydar stated, "Today in the defense  budget there are no surface reserves" allowing it to be reduced  solely at the expense of the Defense Ministry. However, the  leader of "Vybor Rossii" believes that "a long-term program of  military reform and long-term program of reductions in the Armed  Forces is required." In the future, Gaydar sees a reduction in  military expenditures through structuring of the Armed Forces  and reduction in military units "which today are undermanned and  therefore not combat ready."    However, Yegor Gaydar's position is not fully shared by his  colleagues in the faction or by the Chairman of the Defense  Committee Sergey Yushenkov. He stated to the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA  correspondent that he would try to obtain ratification of the  defense budget "at least at the 1993 level." But the present  proposed level of defense expenditures, as you know, is less  than last year.    The press has stated that a number of ministries are  insisting on revision of the benefits list for service members.  In the press service of the Government of the Russian  Federation, it was reported that at the last session of the  government, this question was not raised, and it is still not  known whether the question will be considered next Thursday.  However, the position of the departments which are forced to pay  for a number of benefits granted to service members by the RF  Law "On the Status of Service Members" partially from their own  pockets has been and remains unchanged: Such benefits should be  paid from the federal budget. This is understood by all, but the  "damned question" of money (which apparently the state, it turns  out, does not have for the adopted law) stirs up public opinion  and heats up passions. The departments do not want to pay  benefits to the army at their own expense. The Defense Ministry  does not have a kopeck for this purpose. The federal budget,  with which all agree, is not made of rubber either. What is the  solution?    They are searching for it, including in the State Duma.  Sergey Yushenkov said that the question will be considered at a  session of the Defense Committee. The Duma members have  different approaches to the question. Yushenkov himself wants to  continue seeking implementation of the "benefits" articles of  the law and ensure their financing with a concrete line in the  federal budget.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ETHICS REFORM IN LOS ANGELES  </P> <P> I was hopeful when I read about the ethical reforms proposed by a mayoral  commission (Nov. 21-22) to apply to Los Angeles city elected officials. I was  dismayed to read that members of the City Council are expected to come out  against the reforms.  </P> <P> Electoral positions of public trust should have attractive enough salaries to  encourage people to serve, let them maintain an appropriate life style, and put  their children through college.  </P> <P> There should be no augmenting of that salary, however. If a person cannot get  by on the stated salary, he shouldn't run for that office. No outside  employment, lobbyist gifts, free passes, gift vacations or trips or honorariums  should be allowed -- period. No exceptions should be permitted, and that also  means the abolition of political action committees.  </P> <P> If rules such as these had been in effect by 1988, Mayor Tom Bradley's  reputation would still be intact. If these reforms are enacted, perhaps we will  not have to read the conflict of interest stories or other tales of petty greed  reported all too frequently in The Times.  </P> <P> If the City Council won't enact these needed regulations or the mayor declines  to sign such a bill into law, then a ballot initiative should be passed to try  to keep our city officials semi-honest.  </P> <P> GARY A. LYNCH  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

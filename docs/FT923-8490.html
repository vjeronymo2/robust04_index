			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / West drafts UN plan for use of force in Bosnia BRITAIN last night reached agreement with the US and France on a draft United Nations resolution calling for the use of force, if needed, to deliver humanitarian aid in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina. The draft resolution also endorses international demands for access to Serb-controlled detention camps. Concern about the camps and human rights abuses in the former Yugoslavia is spelt out further in a separate draft resolution. The two draft texts, also agreed by Belgium, were submitted last night to the other members of the 15-nation Security Council in closed-door consultations at the UN in New York. They are not expected to come to a vote until tomorrow or Thursday. The proposals were hammered out after days of negotiations to bypass differences between western powers about the scope of any military involvement in the former Yugoslavia. Pressure for some kind of gesture has grown with media reports of Serb detention camps holding emaciated Moslem prisoners. The main resolution would authorise 'all necessary means to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance'. This implies use of force, but it does not spell out exactly what would be involved or who would organise it. The draft leaves open a number of options. It calls on all states to 'take nationally or through regional agencies or arrangements all measures necessary to facilitate, in co-ordination with the UN, the delivery by relevant UN humanitarian organisations and others of humanitarian assistance to Sarajevo and, wherever needed, in other parts of Bosnia-Hercegovina'. This resolution also 'demands that unimpeded and continuous access to camps, prisons and detention centres be granted immediately to the International Committee of the Red Cross and other relevant humanitarian organisations and that all detainees therein receive humane treatment, including adequate food, shelter and medical care'. Elaborating on western concern about reports of atrocities, the second resolution repeats a demand for access to detention centres and expresses 'grave alarm' at reports of abuses against civilians. In London, prime minister John Major's office confirmed that British ground troops and airmen might be called on to protect the flow of relief to victims of the fighting in Bosnia. Downing Street said Britain was negotiating with the US and France to determine what each would contribute to an escort force to protect aid convoys. Officials added that the precise role and command structure of the escort forces involved striking a delicate political balance to keep the UN on board. In Brussels, Nato started drawing up contingency plans to send troops to Bosnia, but senior Nato officials and other military experts voiced concern about the difficulties and dangers of committing forces to the region. In London, Mr Willem Van Eekelen, secretary-general of the WEU, the nine-nation European grouping, said international relief convoys should be protected by European forces, but backed by US air-power. There was a lull in fighting around the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo yesterday, but residents said they were running out of bread. The Red Cross confirmed it received permission to visit detention camps in Bosnia. Further reports, Page 2</p>

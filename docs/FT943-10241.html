			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Stronger yen helps boost Japan surplus Japan's current account surplus widened in June to Dollars 11.1bn (Pounds 7.1bn), up 4.7 per cent on a year earlier, according to preliminary figures released yesterday by the Finance Ministry. In the first six months of the year the surplus was up 2.2 per cent at Dollars 68.8bn, the highest figure on record.

The overall increase in the current account surplus owed much to the strengthening yen, as prices of exports rose with the value of the Japanese currency and import prices fell. Measured in yen terms, the increase in June's current account surplus was just 0.2 per cent. In the first six months of the year, exports decreased by 0.9 per cent in volume while imports grew by 10.4 per cent. Analysts pointed to the yen figures as evidence that the huge surplus, the cause of much trade friction between the US and Japan, is finally peaking. 'We seem to be at or near the peak of the current account surplus,' said Mr Richard Werner, chief economist at Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo.

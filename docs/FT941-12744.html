			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Sir Denys Henderson to join Rank board Rank Organisation yesterday ended more than a year of speculation by naming Sir Denys Henderson, head of ICI, as the leisure group's nominee chairman. Sir Denys, who retires as ICI chairman in April next year, will become a non-executive director of Rank in March. After retiring from ICI, where he masterminded the demerger of the drugs group Zeneca, he will be appointed non-executive chairman of Rank. He will work part-time at the company's headquarters. Sir Denys said yesterday he was delighted at the appointment. 'I hope my experience in various different fields of business will enable me to contribute to the company's continuing success,' he said. He replaces Sir Leslie Fletcher, who took over as temporary chairman following the death of Sir Patrick Meany in 1992. Sir Denys and Sir Patrick were close personal friends for many years, and the latter was once a director on the ICI board. That friendship is likely to stand Sir Denys in good stead in his new post, where he will work closely with Mr Michael Gifford, Rank's blunt speaking chief executive. Both were named in a survey of Britain's toughest bosses. Mr Gifford said he, too, was delighted at the appointment. Rank is believed to have been discussing Sir Denys's nomination for several months. Sir Denys is also a director of RTZ and Barclays. Rank is carrying debt of almost Pounds 1bn, the legacy of the Pounds 889m Mecca takeover. It has already announced annual pre-tax profits up from Pounds 230m to Pounds 276.6m. See Observer</p>

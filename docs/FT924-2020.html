			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Wills debt-swap banks sell shares BANKS holding a third of the 5 per cent cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares in Wills Group, the engineering equipment distributor, have converted and sold their holdings at close to the market price. The ordinary shares were unchanged at 14p. Holders of 878,000 preference converted into 8.78m ordinary, or 11.9 per cent of the enlarged equity, which were then placed at 12p a share. The preference were issued when the banks swapped debt of Pounds 4.56m for 2.4m shares as part of a capital reconstruction in October last year. Three of the eight banks involved converted yesterday. The remaining shares are convertible or redeemable no later than November 2001. Mr David Massie, chairman, said it would be wrong to see yesterday's conversion as taking a loss - the original debt swap and conversion valued the ordinary at 19p. At the time of the swap there was a rights issue at 3 1/2 p per share and the present price seemed a long way off, he said.</p>

Hojjat ol-Eslam Fallahian said: The person who intended to  assassinate the president was Kurosh Nik-Akhtar whose surname  used to be Kamare'i in the past.    The information minister said: In addition to arresting  Kurosh Nik-Akhtar, who was apprehended because of the full  awareness and prompt action of our courageous people on 1  February, a large network of his accomplices and cohorts have  been identified and arrested.    According to the information minister, more than 20 members  of this network's nucleus who were either aware of the  assassination plan or who cooperated with the terrorist, have  been arrested. The information minister added: During the  preliminary questionings, all the people who were arrested  confessed their ominous and counterrevolutionary objectives.  These confessions have shown that most members of the group  were involved in many immoral and corrupt acts.    The general decision of the terrorists was to start shouting  antistate and apparently revolutionary slogans in order to  attract the attention of public opinion and to justify their  counterrevolutionary movement by distracting the people. They  intended to propagate their blind ideas in order to impress the  Muslim nation with their terrorist act and to spread public  mistrust toward high-ranking pious, revolutionary, and  hard-working elements.    The information minister also stated that in order to ensure  that the assassination plot would be as successful as possible,  the suspects had held a coordination meeting the night before  the attempt and had discussed the details of the plan.    The information minister said: There are persons among those  who were arrested who were affiliated with atheist leftist  groups and have a criminal record.    The criminal records and confessions by the suspects have  shown to also have a record of drunkenness, moral corruption,  and addiction.</p>

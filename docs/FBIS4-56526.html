			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Edwin Britez: "The Last Hope Dissolved"] </F>   [Text] Judge Jose Agustin Fernandez' decision to dismiss  charges against General Lino Cesar Oviedo for his alleged  violation of the Electoral Code reminds us of the kind of  country in which we live. From time to time it is necessary to  come to earth and look at ourselves in a mirror so as not to  forget that despite the passage of time we continue to live in a  country that has not changed.    Perhaps this is Judge Jose Agustin Fernandez's only merit,  if  we need to find a positive side to the decision. Or perhaps it  is Electoral Prosecutor Carlos Aranda Daroczi's merit to remind  us the kind of country in which we live because instead of  formally filing charges against Oviedo he simply handed the file  on the alleged crime to the judge.    The fact is that Army Commander Gen. Lino Cesar Oviedo is  free to continue participating in politics for as long as he  chooses. Neither his natural Armed Forces commanders nor the law  or ordinary justice can stop him. The truth is that the judge  was the last hope.    Of course, we could not expect the present Armed Forces  commander in chief [President Juan Carlos Wasmosy], for whose  candidacy Oviedo worked without pause during the electoral  campaign, to order his retirement for breaking a law. Neither  could we expect Gen. Oviedo to get scared and request his  retirement because of Rambo [Hermes Rafael] Saguier's protests  or the reports presented by [Liberal Party leaders] Domingo  Laino or Bogado Gondra.    We would offend the intelligence of Gen. Oviedo if we  thought  he would authorize an eventual entry of U.S. troops into the  country at a time there was a possibility of retiring him and  when the only ones who could control him were those in "Strong  Roads 94-South."    Now that we can no longer object to the Army commander on  political, legal, and least of all military grounds, we must sit  down and mentally design policies for the 1993-98 period, with a  military leader as the central axis of the transition to  democracy.    Our reality for the next four years, even though it might  hurt to admit it, will be one of a civilian government under  Armed Forces tutelage. The country's rudder will be operated  from the barracks for as long as the state apparatus continues  as it is today. That is why there is resistance to reforming  the state, the privatization program, judicial branch changes,  and the appointment of independent-minded officials.    The current situation favors the unofficial handling of  public affairs because institutions operate based on political  loyalties and because these political loyalties are nothing else  than blind obedience to the individual in command, never fearing  the law, and least of all support for reasonable government.    Prosecutor Carlos Aranda discovered a single possible  electoral crime in the files. He handed the judge the evidence  of an act at the Interior Ministry involving Oviedo and the  then-Colorado Party presidential hopeful Juan Carlos Wasmosy and  his running mate Angel Roberto Seifart. During this act, Oviedo  said the ANR [National Republican Association-Colorado Party]  and the Armed Forces would rule for ever.    Let us remind ourselves of some data from the archives  regarding military interference in politics, just to make the  prosecutor and the judge blush before their  friends:     -  "Laymen Club charges that the military are  interfering in politics." (ABC COLOR 6 Jul 92)    -  Former President  Gen. Andres Rodrigues votes in the internal elections of the  Colorado Party. Gen. Oviedo justifies military men voting in  the internal elections of the Colorado Party. (ABC COLOR 14 Aug  93)    -  Current Colorado Party President Eugenio Sanabria Cantero  reveals that the ANR consulted Gen. Rodriguez, who in turn  consulted the Armed Forces about the Wasmosy-Seifart ticket.  (ABC COLOR 7 Sep 92)    -  "Former Colorado Party Presidential  candidate Luis Maria Argana urges his fellow party members not  to be afraid of the military men currently in power." (ABC COLOR  25 Oct 92)    -  "Frutos [not further identified] criticizes the  generals who support the Wasmosy-Seifart ticket." He mentions  Generals Oviedo, Marino Gonzalez, and Rodriguez. (ABC COLOR 21  Nov 92)    -  "Lino Oviedo again meddles in politics in Fuerte Olimpo.  Military man participated in a political rally organized by  Wasmosy and Seifart." (ABC COLOR 5 Dec 92)    -  "Colorado Party  internal elections. Oviedo gives his opinion before polling  concludes. `The people can lump it if they have the desire to  return to the past,' he said referring to Argana after  announcing that he had voted for the Wasmosy-Seifart ticket."  (ABC COLOR 28 Dec 92)    -  "The military men who participated in the  ANR rally may be punished." (ABC COLOR 5 Feb 93)    Finally, after ANR's victory was made known on election day,  Oviedo, who was still euphoric, stated that his remarks at the  Interior Ministry during the election campaign were not made to  "lift the spirit and courage of the Colorados, because his voice  and vote respond to only one person."    The last hope of a military caudillo who would bow before  the  law has now vanished with Judge Jose Agustin Fernandez'  decision. We must now resign ourselves to putting up with a  military chief as the focal point of the transition to democracy  in the 1993-98 period, and at the same time observe how the  pieces are moved in a plan that contemplates the immobility of  the state's obsolete structure so that it can remain at the  service of those who seek continuity.    The background data showing that the law has been violated  is  useless, the law itself is useless when those who administrate  it think more about the bench they sit on than the justice that  concerns us.</p>

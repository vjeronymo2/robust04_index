Peligre is closed for repairs. That  is all we were able to ascertain. No answer was given to what  kind of repairs, the cost of those repairs, or the duration of  those repairs since the general manager continues to hide behind  a great wall of silence. He has perhaps chosen not to speak with  the press because our calls remain unanswered. Jean Max Blanc  tries to find some explanations in the following report:    [Begin recording, in Creole] The problem of electricity in  Haiti is not going to be solved by the end of the week or within  a few days. Currently, the authorities of Electricity of Haiti  [EDH] have closed the Peligre power station, which supplies  power to the West Department. A high-ranking employee in the  company told Radio Metropole that the authorities made such a  decision in order to repair the Peligre station. However, this  employee is not able to tell us how long those repairs will  take, how much they will cost, or how much damage there is in  the station.    Some say the damages are not inconsequential in the Peligre  station. The management EDH will not confirm this information.  The general manager, Axel Saint-Dic, never agreed to receive  journalists and even refused to answer phone calls. Manager  Saint-Dic, according to his secretary, is in meetings everyday.  Perhaps Saint-Dic is seeking solutions to the electricity  problem the country has been facing since 1990.    Although this problem is not new, it reached a new level  some  time ago. For instance, some neighborhoods do not have  electricity at all, while others receive some electricity once  or twice a week. Regardless of who comments on that problem, the  answers are basically the same. [passage omitted]    The electricity problem in the country not only increases  the  prices of products, but also creates a change in lifestyle for  Haitians. The problem of electricity is now closely linked to  the problem of fuel. Some business people say those problems  have caused the decrease in sales, and the prices of freezer  products have increased. They explain that the greater the stock  of products requiring refrigeration, the more fuel the  generators need to operate. The result is that the consumers pay  those costs while their purchase power is at a standstill. The  other problem is that since the consumers cannot stock at home,  they are obliged to spend more on gasoline to market everyday.  [passage omitted] If people are more or less informed on the  fluctuating price of gasoline, no one knows when Haitians will  no longer have to face this electricity dilemma in the country.    While still waiting for the EDH general manager, Axel  Saint-Dic, to answer questions regarding the importance and  duration of the work to be done in Peligre, most of the  neighborhoods in Port-au- Prince are blacked out, while others  enjoy electricity 24 hours a day. Some residents explain that in  addition to these problems, some people steal their  transformers. The daily blackout encourages much negative  behaivior, which is being reported in Port-au-Prince.

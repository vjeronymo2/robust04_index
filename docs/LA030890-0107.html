Jose Campos Martinez died after spraying almond trees with the potent pesticide  parathion in the Wasco area. "We found parathion in his stomach but not on his  skin, not on his clothing and not in his liver, lungs or kidneys," said Jim  Malouf, chief investigator in the Kern County coroner's office.  </P></p>

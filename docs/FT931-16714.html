			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / UK Company News: NatWest seeks a new life - Resolution to secure long-term income THE NEW year's resolution of most high street banks is to make more money than in the past year. Beset by provisions on bad loans, they are seeking ways to increase steady sources of income. This is why National Westminster Bank is placing both hope and Pounds 105m in a new insurance subsidiary. National Westminster Life Assurance is an expression of optimism for the future. Mr Lawrence Churchill, its chief executive, believes it can sell 200,000 policies in its first year. NatWest Life starts underwriting this week, and has a regional sales force of 1,900 already in place. But the venture is also an admission of past error. The bank did not tie to a life insurer in 1988 when the Financial Services Act forced it to choose. It made great play of the fact that its NatWest Insurance Services subsidiary was an independent intermediary which offered unbiased advice. Things have changed since then. Although NatWest Insurance Services contributed profits of Pounds 54m in the first half of last year, the bank has come to have second thoughts about advising the most profitable segment of its customer base to take its related business elsewhere. The growth of 'bancassurance', the sale of insurance through banks, in Europe is being matched in Britain. Of the 1.2m Lloyds Bank customers with life and pensions policies, 14 per cent are with its Black Horse Financial Services subsidiary. Lloyds thinks it can raise that to 35 per cent by 1995. Life assurance sales fit well with NatWest's attempt to remodel its branch network, removing much processing work and making more space available as a customer service and sales area. For branches to become more profitable, they will have to generate more sales of financial products. Part of NatWest's strategy, along with that of other high street banks, is to raise non-interest income which does not carry the risk of loans going bad. At the half-year, the non-interest income was Pounds 1.38bn, about 43 per cent of the total, and the bank wants to increase this. The sale of tied life assurance fits well with many of NatWest's intentions. Potentially at least, it is a good way of making money compared with lending. 'Life assurance has high quality profits. People tend to die in a predictable way, so you can price risk,' said Mr Churchill. The bank has devoted considerable effort to analysing and planning its new venture. It is the dominant partner, with a 92.5 per cent stake, but has involved Clerical Medical, the life insurer, to handle the fund management and provide start-up advice on administration and systems. NatWest Life will offer 12 standard life products, which it believes will cover 95 per cent of what its customers want. Most of the selling will be done by 1,500 financial advisers, who will work from referrals by branch staff, and independent requests from NatWest customers for advice. A venture into tied life assurance selling raises several issues for a clearing bank. There is the question of exploiting a bank's customer base to sell products. One reason for the growth of tied sales is that 'warm selling' through branches is more effective than cold calling. Bank advisers usually sell about four policies for every one managed by an insurer's sales force. However, there is great potential for upsetting customers by selling too aggressively. As Mr Churchill admitted, those going into bank branches may get 'cheesed off' by a succession of offers. He insisted that the bank's priority was to develop a trusted relationship rather than exploit it. The fine dividing line has already been recognised in the banking code of practice, introduced this year, which prevents bank sales forces from simply tapping into customer databases to find potential customers. Customers have to be referred by branch staff. There is also the question of the selection and training of staff. The cultural divide between many traditional branch staff and insurance sellers has already been recognised by NatWest. It has used psychometric tests to help recruit internally staff who will be happy to talk and sell to customers. It has also introduced unusual employment terms. Unlike most insurance sales forces, NatWest Life's advisers will be paid largely by salary with a small bonus linked to sales. Mr Churchill said this would restrain over-enthusiastic selling. But it could also encourage inertia. Finally, there is the question of how quickly NatWest Life will start contributing to profits. Mr Churchill hoped it would contribute a 'significant proportion' of profits in the long term. In terms of the embedded value of policies, he thought it would be profitable by the end of the first year. However, he estimated that it would be three years before it passed on a dividend to the bank. This means that NatWest cannot hope for it to balance the weight of lending problems as fast as it might wish. Mr Churchill said the bank took a long-term view. 'This is not the flavour of the year. Internally, it is viewed as one of the most visible strategy moves in 20 years,' he said. This part of the NatWest's new year's resolution will have to wait until past the end of 1993 to prove its value.</p>

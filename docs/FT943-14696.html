			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / 'Cash for questions' inquiry may put MPs' outside interests at risk MPs will decide today whether to hold a full-scale parliamentary investigation into the so-called 'cash for questions' affair, in a move that could have far-reaching consequences for their ability to exploit outside interests to augment their income. Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, yesterday gave the go-ahead for an emergency debate today into whether to refer the issue to the Committee of Privileges. The matter arose from newspaper allegations that two Conservative MPs were willing to accept Pounds 1,000 to table parliamentary questions. Addressing a packed and tense Commons chamber, Miss Boothroyd said there was 'an urgent need to clarify the law of parliament in this area'. She said the conduct of The Sunday Times newspaper, which claimed to have used a reporter posing as a businessman to approach Labour and Conservative MPs, 'merits further examination'. One focus of today's debate is expected to be whether or not MPs with outside consultancies should be allowed to sit on the ad hoc committee of senior members to which the Commons is expected to refer the issue. Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, the Labour MP for Workington, said any report produced by such a body would be 'discredited' without an assurance that its members had no conflict of interest with work they undertook as parliamentary consultants. But Labour last night stopped short of demanding that MPs with consultancies be excluded from the committee. A senior spokesman said he hoped the body would recommend 'a radical tightening up' of the rules relating to consultancies. There is little evidence that either the extent of MPs' outside interests or the large number of MPs who have them are on the decline in what is said to be the age of the career politician. Fewer than 10 per cent of MPs had nothing to declare in the most recent register of members' interests - a document which requires disclosure of property holdings and overseas visits as well as consultancies and adviserships. Yesterday's announcement came some 48 hours after the two MPs - Mr Graham Riddick and Mr David Tredinnick - were suspended as junior ministerial aides. The speed of Downing Street's reaction to the newspaper's claims was interpreted as a sign of the government's continuing sensitivity to any suggestion of impropriety in the wake of a series of embarrassments. A senior government spokesman said yesterday that Mr John Major supported Miss Boothroyd's decision. Both suspended MPs deny wrongdoing.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 28 (XINHUA) -- Prime Minister Tsutomo  Hata today welcomed an agreement reached between the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and South Korea on holding  their first summit meeting next month.    The agreement between the DPRK and South Korea is "good  news," Hata was quoted by local press as saying.    The outgoing prime minister said that the summit would also  have a good effect on relations between Japan and the DPRK.    He indicated that Tokyo will provide the DPRK with economic  and technical assistance if the nuclear issue is settled in the  forthcoming high-level talks between the DPRK and the U.S.    The DPRK and South Korea agreed earlier in the day to hold  an  inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang on July 25-27, followed by a  second meeting at a later date, but the location is yet to be  decided.    In a related development, government sources were quoted as  saying that Japan will send a senior Foreign Ministry official  to Washington this week to consult with U.S. and South Korean  officials ahead of the planned U.S.-DPRK talks in Geneva in  early July.</p>

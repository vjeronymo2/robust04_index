			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Row over control of McCain Foods flares up The two-year feud for management control of family-owned McCain Foods, the international frozen foods group, has flared up again. Mr Wallace McCain, 64, co-chief executive with his brother Harrison, 66, has proposed ending their dispute over succession by taking the company public and bringing in an outsider to lead it. But McCain Foods' chairman, Mr Andrew McCain, said the board would come up with its own proposal for the succession on September 13. It opposes the plan to go public. McCain Foods has CDollars 3bn (USDollars 2.1bn) in annual sales and is highly profitable. The proceeds of a public issue would be used to expand the business internationally and enable a dividend to be paid, Mr Wallace McCain said. The company is 100 per cent controlled by several generations of the McCain family. Four outside directors would be appointed, while the board would include the two brothers and the new chief executive. Last April a New Brunswick judge arbitrated the dispute between the brothers and suggested ways to resolve it, including going public and appointing an outsider as chief executive. Mr Wallace and Mr Harrison McCain support different members of the family to succeed them.</p>

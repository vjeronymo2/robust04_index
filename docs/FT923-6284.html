			<p>920825 FT  25 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Base rate fears prompt heavy setback UK EQUITIES yesterday suff-ered their biggest daily setback since the failed Soviet coup a year ago, as renewed falls in the US dollar and sterling fuelled both global economic worries and fears that UK base rates might have to be raised to protect the pound. The FT-SE Index dropped 54.6 points, or 2.3 per cent, as shares in international dollar earners and domestic interest rate-related UK companies fell heavily. However, trading volume remained moderate and most of the damage to share prices reflected marking down operations at the opening of the market. The Footsie was 45 points down at the first calculation of the day and extended the loss to 59.7 after Wall Street opened sharply weaker, to record a day's low of 2,306.0. The stock market, however, steadied as the pound rallied after moving dangerously close to its ERM floor and Wall Street also edged off its early low to show a decline of 13 Dow points in UK hours. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,311.1, with the day's loss of 54.6 just exceeding daily falls recorded earlier this year, notably the 51.5-point loss chalked up in mid-July when one UK building society raised mortgage rates. Seaq volume of 383.7m shares yesterday compared with 436.9m on Friday. On August 19 last year, the Footsie fell by 80.5 (or 3.1 per cent) as London reacted to the attempted coup in the former Soviet Union. The continued recovery in the Tokyo market was ignored in London. A widening in the UK trade deficit to Pounds 934m in July, hardly encouraging for sterling, was almost lost in the general rush of bearish factors on the first day of the new equity trading account. With the City of London braced for further pressure on the dollar and, via the foreign exchange cross-rates, the pound, share prices were marked down by marketmakers who did not wait for sellers to arrive. Both marketmakers and retail investors were inclined to act in stock index futures rather than in underlying equities, which were often difficult markets. London shared in the general setback across European bourses as dollar weakness took effect. But the downturn in the UK market took in substantial losses in shares which would suffer immediately if UK base rates have to be raised to protect sterling's position in the ERM network. Thus, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, stores and building issues all came in for severe losses. These groups of stocks have traded somewhat erratically in recent weeks as currency and interest rate factors have ebbed and flowed, and share prices have become highly volatile. Equity strategists could find little reason for confidence until the outlook for sterling and UK interest rates becomes more clear. An attempt at a modest rally at midsession was wiped out when a UK trading house implemented a large sell programme across the range of the market. London-based securities houses have suffered heavy losses since the pound began its latest slide last week. Trading books are now severely squeezed.</p>

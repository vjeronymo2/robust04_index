			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / A ring that sounds like profit: China's decision to establish a second telephone network means big opportunities for western telecommunications companies China's decision last month to sanction a second telephone network to compete with the state monopoly marks a radical shift in policy, and one that should bring substantial benefits to international suppliers of telecommunications equipment now crowding a market worth billions of dollars a year. Beijing says the competing network, to be known as China United Telecommunications, or China Unicom, will help 'accelerate' the development of the telecommunications sector to cope with the demands of a rapidly modernising economy whose orderly growth is being constrained by poor communications, especially to outlying regions. The decision to open the telecommunications sector to competition followed a long and bruising debate within the Chinese bureaucracy. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications had fought to preserve its monopoly, but was forced to give ground to a powerful coalition of interests involving three ministries - of the railways, the electronics industry and electric power. These are China Unicom's main partners among 17 shareholders, which include several of China's main state-owned corporations. China Unicom faces formidable obstacles, however, in 'grafting' a second network on to existing facilities in spite of the significant assets brought to bear by the state bodies involved in the project. Both the Ministry of Railways and Ministry of Electric Power presently operate their own communications networks, necessitated by primitive existing telecommunications. The Ministry of Railways, for example, owns 22,000 miles of above-ground lines, 19,000 miles of coaxial cable and 1,900 miles of optical-fibre cable. Aside from these cable facilities, the ministry, whose reach extends to most corners of China, has set up numerous microwave links plus switching capacity for 400,000 telephone lines. Likewise, the Ministry of Electric Power owns 17,000 miles of digital microwave links. 'All of these private networks have spare capacity which could be made available to the public,' says Mr He Fei Chang, director of telecommunications at the Ministry of Electronics, one of China Unicom's partners. China's need for a crash programme to modernise its telecommunications has not been in doubt for years, but the best means of achieving a more rapid extension of services has been the subject of endless debate since the 1980s. Then it became clear that, unless huge investment was made, the system would continue to fall far short of China's requirements well into the next century. This debate was sharpened by the publication in 1992 of a comprehensive World Bank study of China's telecommunications sector* which found that the country's telephone system is 'among the least developed in Asia relative to population size, and service quality is low'. It reported: 'Public telephones are virtually non-existent. Networks are heavily congested, making it almost impossible to communicate by telephone during peak business hours. Long delays are experienced in long-distance telephone calls . . . While some of the world's most advanced technologies are being introduced in the fastest-growing parts of the network, old and obsolete plant is still widespread.' Among the World Bank's main themes was the need for competition. But at that stage the bank did not envisage anything as ambitious as building a second network. Such a bold move would not, in any case, have been possible before China embarked on the latest, accelerated phase of economic reform heralded by a visit to southern China in early 1992 by Mr Deng Xiaoping, the country's senior leader. Mr Deng, known for his earthiness, gave a simple instruction to local officials, which then became a slogan throughout China. 'Do it faster,' he is reported to have said in reference to the need for a quickening of China's economic growth. Since then China's economy has recorded growth rates exceeding 13 per cent a year and investment in telecommunications has risen sharply. Indeed, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, which is due to spend Yn53.6bn (Dollars 6.23bn) on telecommunications this year, achieved its planning targets for the current five-year plan (1991-1995) by 1993, two years ahead of schedule. Yet, for all the increase in expenditure and the fairly impressive spread of services in coastal areas and larger cities, including dramatic improvements in line quality, China's average national penetration rate (telephones per 100 persons) hovers around a minuscule 2.5 per cent. This compares with rates of 60 per cent in most developed countries. China plans to increase the number of telephone lines from the present 30m to 110m by 2000, involving expenditure of Yn450bn and including some Dollars 7bn in loans from abroad. This would provide a penetration rate of 8 per cent, still low by international standards and those of its Asian neighbours, though it would represent a big leap for China. Western telecommunications experts say the magnitude of the task can be gauged from the fact that, if China holds to its plans of installing between 10m and 11m lines a year for the rest of the century, this would be equivalent to installing Britain's telephone network every three years. Among China's many difficulties in bridging the gulf between supply and demand is one of distribution. While the official figure for existing capacity is 30m lines, only about 17m have actually been connected, according to some western estimates. 'It's one thing to install switching equipment; it's quite another to get a line to a house or a factory,' says a western telecommunications expert in Beijing. The huge technical and logistical problems involved in extending a telephone network throughout China with its 1.2bn people and thousands of cities, towns and hamlets is the main reason why powerful figures in the leadership backed the establishment of Unicom. Such a gargantuan task is simply beyond the capacity of a single organisation. Both Mr Zhu Rongji, the senior vice-premier in charge of the economy, and Mr Zou Jiahua, a vice-premier responsible for the telecommunications sector, are solidly behind the Unicom proposal. One of the most telling arguments in favour of promoting competition was that it would vastly improve access to telephones by communities in more remote areas, and thus help to slow the widening economic and social gap between coastal regions and the hinterland. The Ministry of Railways, for example, with its extensive existing network could deliver services in far-flung areas like Yunnan in the south west and Xinjiang in the west. Competition, the authorities say, would also help to reduce the cost of telecommunications services which are among the most expensive in the world. Installation fees in the cities are running at about Yn6,000 and in rural areas at Yn3,000. This is three to four times the cost of a phone installation in the UK, and perhaps as much as eight times that in the US. While Chinese officials say they are keen to promote telecommunications competition, they are also making it clear this will not extend to allowing foreign participation in the operation of networks for the foreseeable future. Indeed Vice-Premier Zou, announcing the decision to allow a second network, stressed that China Unicom was a pilot project and that no other corporations would be authorised to operate telecommunications services. Foreigners would be restricted to supplying equipment and technical advice to the new network and possibly taking some form of equity participation at a future date. In spite of the looming threat from Unicom, telecommunication ministry officials are seeking to put the best face on the loss of their monopoly, insisting competition is in the interests of all. But there is also no doubt they are apprehensive about the practicalities of making the new dual system work. Not least among the ministry's concerns are the technical difficulties involved in achieving an interface between parallel networks. Unicom will be obliged to piggy-back on the existing system run by the telecommunications ministry in much the same way as the new Optus network in Australia is joined to the state-owned system. Other ministry concerns include regulating competition in a new, more free-wheeling telecommunications sector - it is both regulator and provider through its subsidiaries - in the absence of a telecommunications law (one is still in the drafting stage). Officials also anticipate problems over sharing scarce resources such as technical staff. Mr Xu Shanyan, the telecommunications ministry's chief spokesman, describes these as 'unresolved issues' and says they will require careful study and discussion in the implementation phase. Since Unicom will depend heavily on the telecommunications ministry in the start-up phase, officials of the new network are careful to stress their desire to avoid duplication and keep competition within limits. Mr Zhao Weichen, chairman of Unicom, says the network will 'engage in wide-ranging co-operation and co-development' by adhering to what he described as a policy of 'five expansions'. These include an expansion of co-operation with domestic and international networks 'within the scope permitted by Chinese government policy'. But western observers are sceptical about declarations that the new network will not engage in fierce competition. 'China Unicom is meant to restrict its activities and not to compete directly with the telecommunications ministry, but in practice they will obviously compete,' says a representative of a Western telecommunications corporation. China Unicom's plans are certainly ambitious. Its development targets for the rest of this century include providing 12m new lines, which will increase the nation-wide telephone penetration rate by 1 percentage point; and acquiring a 10 per cent share of national and international trunk traffic plus 30 per cent of the mobile telephone market with services in more than 100 cities. The new network also plans to develop the manufacturing capacity of the Ministry of Electronics Industry, one of its three founding partners. This will bring the electronics ministry into direct competition with the telecommunications ministry, whose subsidiaries are heavily engaged in foreign joint ventures manufacturing telecommunications equipment, including switching gear and optical fibre cable. Recent reports of a glut in the supply of optical fibre cable due to excess manufacturing capacity should cause some hesitation among prospective new entrants in what is becoming a highly competitive market. But all the signs are that the world's telecommunications giants are pursuing the China market as if the question is not whether they can afford to be participants but whether they can afford not to be. Without exception, companies such as AT&amp;T and Motorola of the US, Alcatel of France, Northern Telecom of Canada, Siemens of Germany, Ericsson of Sweden, NEC and Fujitsu of Japan, Nokia of Finland, and GPT, the UK-based supplier, are engaged in joint ventures in China. The advent of a second network - which will vastly increase demand for all manner of equipment including switching gear, transmission lines, communications software and cellular phones - could hardly have come at a more advantageous moment for the world's big telecommunications manufacturers. Mr Chisun Lai, Motorola's chief representative in Beijing, summed up the favourable industry view when he said of the decision to sanction a second network: 'What China has done is help speed up the market development of the telecommunications industry with additional operators and networks. This is certainly positive for the industry and positive for companies involved in that industry.' *People's Republic of China Telecommunications Sector Study: Survey, Assessment and Strategy Recommendations.

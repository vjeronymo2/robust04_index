The crowd also booed the joint statement tabled during  the meeting when it was read to them and one man, tears  streaming down his face, wailed aloud.    King Zwelithini, who was met with thunderous applause,  calmed  the crowd, telling them their patience would be rewarded. He  called on his subjects to exercise restraint on their way home.  The large crowd was expected to return to King's Park Stadium,  from where they would be bused home. Before leaving, the crowd  sang a farewell Zulu song to their monarch.    Police maintained a strong presence throughout and  channelled  people to their destinations. Durban's litter-strewn West  Street emptied within minutes.</p>

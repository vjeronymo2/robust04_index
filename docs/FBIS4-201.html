			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] It's beginning to look like the biggest stumbling  block towards peace in Liberia. It's the continuing fighting  between Charles Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Front of  Liberia] and the Liberia Peace Council [LPC] in the east of the  country. Much of the fighting had been around the River Cess in  the Grand Bassa County, but now it seems like the battle is  concentrated further north towards the Cote d'Ivoire border,  around the town of Zwedru, with thousands of refugees fleeing  the clashes towards the town of Tapeta. From Monrovia, our  correspondent, Nii Nartey Allison, sent this telex:    More than 2,000 refugees have so far arrived in Tapeta. And,  according to United Nations officials, they are fleeing fighting  between the NPFL and the Peace Council in Zwedru. Zwedru has  twice changed hands and it is not yet clear which group is in  control of the town. Fierce fighting is said to be continuing  around the border village of To and the United Nations Observer  Mission today declared the region a no-go zone. According to  United Nations officials, atrocities in southeastern Liberia by  both the LPC and the NPFL have extended into Zwedru, and  hundreds of residents have fled into the surrounding forests.    The UN said that local officials in Tapeta were physically  preventing some of the escapees from entering the town. Some  300 people are on the move, trying to escape fighting, said a  senior UN official, but they are being prevented by local  authorities from entering Tapeta because of congestion.  Journalists, who attempted at the weekend to go into the area,  were stopped in Gbarnga by the NPFL. The United Nations said  that there is a dire need to move in with food, medicines,  temporary accommodation. They said that 500 malnourished  children aged between one to 12 are in desperate need of food,  medicines, and clothing. The United Nations said that  panic-stricken Zwedru residents arrived in Tapeta and the  village of Diala, 10 miles southeast of Tapeta, with bullet  wounds. The French charity, Medecins Sans Frontieres, the only  aid agency operating in the area, moved in last week with  measles vaccine from mobile clinics.    Meanwhile, the United Nations today said that a fresh influx  of 700 displaced people arrived in the port city of Buchanan on  Saturday [2 April], fleeing continued skirmishes between the  NPFL and the LPC in River Cess County.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Rasht, Gilan Prov., May 13, IRNA -- President Akbar  Hashemi-Rafsanjani said here today that the capacity of the  discovered gas deposits of the country would be enough for 250  years.    Noting that gas is considered as the best fuel for the  country, the president said piped gas had been supplied to 240  cities and towns throughout the country, and that all other  places should indeed be provided with piped gas.    Elsewhere the president said Iran is considered as a steel  exporter today, and predicted that steel production would reach  five million tons in the current calendar year.    Iran is treading the path of self-reliance in many areas  including aluminium, copper, and petrochemical industries, he  added.</p>

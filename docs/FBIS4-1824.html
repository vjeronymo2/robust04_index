			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By S.Y. Yue] </F>   [Text] The Chinese Government has stepped up its efforts  to find potential candidates to fill the principal positions in  the first government of the Special Administrative Region (SAR).  Headhunting by Xinhua (the New China News Agency), which  represents the Beijing Government in the territory, began in  earnest after the collapse of talks between Britain and China on  Hong Kong's political development.    Xinhua has been inviting senior Chinese civil servants at  and  above the staff grade B (D3) -- deputy secretaries and principal  assistants -- to dinner. It is known that former civil servants  such as Wilfred Wong Ying-wai are acting as middlemen in  arranging the meetings. Mr. Wong, who had served in the  government for 17 years, resigned several years ago and is now  the deputy chief executive of the K Wah Group. He has been  acting as a Hong Kong Affairs Adviser to the Chinese Government.    Xinhua officials attending the dinner parties are said to be  quite plain about their intentions, urging senior civil servants  to prepare for the fact that they will no longer work for the  British administration. One staff member said he felt  humiliated when the Xinhua officials he met described his role  as having "served the British Government" for all his years in  the administration.    "When I joined the Government, I only considered it as a  good  and secure job. I have never considered myself as serving the  British administration. I serve the Hong Kong people," he said.  He said he and his colleagues were asked over dinner where  their loyalty lay. The easy -- and truthful -- answer had been  that they supported the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, he  said.    Under the Basic Law, the 22 principal officials should not  have a foreign passport. Senior civil servants, however, are  among those given passports under the British Nationality  package as an inducement for them to stay with the Government.    During their dinners, Xinhua officials give civil servants  the residential number of vice-director Mao Junnian and tell  them to call if they have any "queries". It is understood that  one of the "queries" is what to do about their British passports.    Another senior civil servant said he perceived the dinner  meetings as a way for both sides to get to know each other. One  of those who knew of the meetings but had not yet been invited  said he did not need such people as Mr. Wong to give him the  chance to prove himself capable of being promoted to senior  positions.    "I have worked for the Government for more than 20 years.  Isn't that track record sufficient to show my ability and  potential? Why should I need somebody like him to arrange  meetings with Xinhua officials? It is just ridiculous," he said.</p>

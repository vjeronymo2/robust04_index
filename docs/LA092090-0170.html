			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BASIC EDUCATION FOUND TO BE JOB PATH FOR POOR;  </P> <P> WELFARE: REPORT SAYS THAT SINGLE-PARENT MOTHERS WHO FIRST TRY TO EARN HIGH  SCHOOL DIPLOMAS BEFORE GETTING WORK SKILLS MAY NOT HAVE AN ADVANTAGE.  </P> <P> Low-income, single-parent mothers who receive basic education as a component of  job training programs are more likely to find employment and earn higher wages  than those who first try to earn a high school diploma, according to the  findings of a Rockefeller Foundation report released Wednesday.  </P> <P> The report found that a San Jose job-training program that incorporated  classroom study into technical skills courses "had large positive impacts on  employment and earnings by the end of the first year." By contrast, women in  training programs in three other cities, where remedial education preceded job  training, "did not achieve similar early gains."  </P> <P> Women in the San Jose program experienced a 27% increase in employment and a  47% increase in earnings, compared to a control group that received no  training. By contrast, programs studied in Atlanta; Providence, R.I., and  Washington, D.C., resulted in virtually no gains for the women who  participated.  </P> <P> The study should prompt state officials to consider alternatives to the  traditional school-first, work-training programs as they comply with federal  job-training programs, said senior researcher John Burghardt.  </P> <P> "We're not saying that improving basic education skills or getting people a  (high school diploma) is a bad thing," he said. "But there should be a wider  array of options. People should think about other ways of doing this."  </P> <P> The Family Support Act of 1988, which replaces the Aid to Families with  Dependent Children program, requires states to begin implementing new programs  in October that will shift low-income mothers from welfare dependency to  self-sufficiency.  </P> <P> A key provision of the law requires single, welfare recipients with children  under 3 -- and as young as 1 in some states -- to further their educations or  accept job training to qualify for continued government support. Despite  complaints from critics of the law, who contend that such programs do little to  help keep single mothers off the public dole, states are drawing up a variety  of remedial education and job-training programs.  </P> <P> "We want them to know that they can do something (to help welfare mothers), but  it's more important how you do it," said project director Phoebe Cottingham in  an interview.  </P> <P> The study tracked a random sample of 4,000 poor women in job-training programs  run by private community groups. The Rockefeller Foundation provided $12  million for the demonstration and study. Mathematica Policy Research Inc., a  social policy evaluation firm, analyzed the results of the various programs  after the first group of mothers had completed 12 months of work experience.  </P> <P> In Atlanta, Providence and Washington, the organizations followed the  traditional approach of testing applicants and then providing a typical  classroom education to qualify them for the equivalent of a high school degree.  Those who obtained graduate equivalent degrees then were offered specific job  training skills.  </P> <P> Burghardt of Mathematica said that further study is required to determine  exactly which types of job-training programs work best.  </P></p>

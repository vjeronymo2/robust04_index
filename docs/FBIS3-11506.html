The meeting of the representatives of Latin American  diplomacy coincided with the fleeting 7-hour visit by U.S.  President Albert Gore to Brasilia to invite Brazilian President  Itamar Franco to the Miami meeting.    Gore took advantage of his meeting with Franco and Foreign  Minister Celso Amorim to greet the foreign ministers and  representatives of the 13 countries, which agreed to harmonize  their position regarding the U.S. initiative.    The Rio Group foreign ministers will discuss on 24 April in  Sao Paulo, the seat of the Latin American Parliament  (Parlatino), all matters they want discussed at the Miami  summit, including what some diplomats have termed "the Latin  American perception" of the meeting.    An agenda was approved that will be proposed to the foreign  ministers of the European Union for the 6-monthly joint meeting  to be held between 20 and 23 April at the seat of the Parlatino.    The member countries of the Rio group are: Mexico, Colombia,  Panama, Venezuela, Bolivia, Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay,  Uruguay, Chile, Guatemala, and Trinidad and Tobago.</p>

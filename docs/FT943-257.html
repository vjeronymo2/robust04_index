			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / IRA still recruiting, secret service tells PM The IRA has continued to seek new recruits and to shadow police and army patrols in Northern Ireland in spite of its declared end to violence last month. Evidence from British intelligence that the organisation has sustained a capacity to resume military operations has reinforced Mr John Major's cautious response to the ceasefire. It coincides with growing anger in Belfast about a spate of 'punishment shootings' by the IRA in nationalist areas since the ceasefire declaration. The IRA has also continued actively to operate the criminal 'racketeering' from which it derives much of its finance. Taken alongside uncompromising comments from Mr Gerry Adams and Mr Martin McGuinness, the leading figures in Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, the intelligence has dampened hopes of an imminent breakthrough to pave the way for direct talks between the London government and Sinn Fein. Mr Adams warned this week on his high-profile tour of the US of a possible resurgence of violence if progress towards a political settlement were to reach deadlock. Mr McGuinness said he would never use the word 'permanent' to describe the ceasefire. Despite the two men's insistence they have no direct links with the IRA, British ministers insist both are on the organisation's ruling Army Council. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, reported to the cabinet yesterday on the latest developments in the province, but a substantive review of Sinn Fein's position will not take place until after Mr Adams's US tour. In the meantime there is little prospect of any further gesture by the UK government in the direction of Sinn Fein - such as the lifting of the exclusion order which bars Mr Adams from mainland Britain. Whitehall officials stress that they do not believe that the latest developments necessarily mark a retreat by the IRA from last month's announcement. The socialist group in the European Parliament yesterday nominated Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, for the Nobel Peace Prize. Dr John Alderdice, leader of the non-sectarian Alliance party yesterday had a meeting with Mr Major, in which he urged the prime minister to open direct contacts with the IRA if Sinn Fein leaders persisted in saying they could not speak for the paramilitaries. The purpose of these contacts would be to discuss the handover of IRA weapons.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The national protest committee for the defense of  Polish agriculture has asked the highest authorities of Poland  to start talks urgently. Andrzej Lepper, the leader of the  Samoobrona [militant farmers organization], suggested a state  farm at Montowo in Torun Province as the venue for talks.    The committee demands, among other things, the increase of  funds for agriculture by 8 trillion zlotys by raising the budget  deficit, and that priority be given to workers' companies in  leasing former state farms. It also demands cheap credits for  the purchase of turnover assets and for running production, and  that those guilty of destroying Polish agriculture be called to  account.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 13 (CTK) -- Representatives of the  government and of the central bank today signed a protocol on a  line of credit from the International Monetary Fund and sent it  to IMF director Michel Camdessus. By providing the credit line,  the IMF expressed confidence in the economic policy of  Moravcik's cabinet, Deputy Premier Brigita Schmognerova said.  The IMF thus also made it possible to take out other advance  loans, which would not be possible without a recommendation from  the most significant international financial institution, she  emphasized. She refuted former Premier Vladimir Meciar's  statement made last week that the importance of the IMF loan is  exaggerated. He said that the BB-rating given to the central  bank last year had opened up more opportunities for Slovakia.  He also pointed out that planned loans of over a billion  dollars had not been issued after his resignation.    "The significance of the IMF loan cannot be compared to the  rating," Schmognerova stated. Such "stamping," provided by many  agencies, indicates only the probability that loans will be paid  back, not the level of a country's economic policy, she said.    After the application for the line of credit has been  approved by the IMF Council of Governors, Slovakia should  receive $164 million by the end of the summer, mainly to  reinforce its balance of payments. On the basis of the standby  loan, the second tranche of the transition loan, $91 million,  should also be made available. The amount of money on  Slovakia's credit line corresponds to its quota in the IMF. The  IMF reserves the right to make three corrections during the loan  provision period. The loan will have to be repaid after twenty  months.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Rothmans to cut 1,000 jobs in Europe: Cigarette maker makes Pounds 124m provision for rationalisation as profits fall to Pounds 344m for year Rothmans International, the restructured tobacco group now shorn of its Dunhill luxury goods interests, is to cut 1,000 jobs in Europe in a further rationalisation of cigarette manufacturing. The company is providing Pounds 123.8m to cover the pre-tax cost of the moves, which involve the closure of factories in Berlin and The Hague and rationalisation in Belgium. The provisions resulted in a sharp fall in profits from Pounds 470.7m to Pounds 343.6m for the year to March. Excluding the provisions and the Pounds 31.2m pre-tax costs of last year's group restructuring, profits rose 6 per cent to Pounds 498.6m, with the increase entirely accounted for by exchange rate movements. Mr Bill Ryan, chief executive, said the closures were part of a long process of rationalising acquisitions made after the war. 'In the mid-1970s we had 15 factories in Europe. When this is completed we will have six which is still more than our main competitors.' Most of the job losses will result from the closure of the Berlin factory. Production will be transferred to Zevenaar in the Netherlands and to the two UK factories. Rothmans had another difficult year in Europe with operating profits falling 23 per cent to Pounds 99.6m on slightly lower sales of Pounds 1.04bn (Pounds 1.08bn). Sales were down sharply in France, after a fierce price war, and by more than 15 per cent in the UK, largely because two Budgets fell into the period. Mr Ryan said the rate of decline in Europe had slowed and he was now more optimistic. 'We believe there may well be an improvement in the current year with signs of economies picking up in Germany and France.' Group operating profits rose 5 per cent to Pounds 438.7m, including an additional Pounds 22.5m (Pounds 22.2m) of rationalisation costs on net sales revenue 3 per cent higher at Pounds 2.49bn. Worldwide cigarette volumes fell 8 per cent. The operating profits were less than the City had expected but net investment income of Pounds 59.9m (Pounds 51.7m) was rather better. This rise, which was despite the Pounds 450m special dividend paid last November, partly reflected gains on the disposal of a securities portfolio. Cash generation was also stronger than forecast with net liquid funds falling only Pounds 252.4m to Pounds 665.1m after working capital was almost halved to Pounds 204.1m. Earnings per unit, excluding exceptional costs, edged up to 35.1p (34.6p) and the dividend is 13.2p, up from a pro forma 11.5p. Rothmans' strongest growth continues to come from Asia where profits jumped 37 per cent to Pounds 110.7m on sales of Pounds 408.5m (Pounds 318.4m). The Americas contributed Pounds 90.4m (Pounds 85.5m) and the Pacific Pounds 52.7m (Pounds 46.4m). Mr Nyren Scott Malden, of brokers BZW, edged down his current year forecast by Pounds 15m to Pounds 525m. That puts the shares at 369p, down 9p, on a forward multiple of just over 10 with a yield of 4.5 per cent.</p>

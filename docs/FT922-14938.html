			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / US clears Israel of selling Patriot secrets to China THE US yesterday issued Israel 'a clean bill of health' on charges that it had transferred Patriot missile technology to China. But Ms Margaret Tutwiler, the state department spokesman, refused to address allegations in a department report on Wednesday that an unnamed country - widely assumed to be Israel - had engaged in 'a systematic and growing pattern' of unauthorisied sales of sensitive US military technologies to third countries. The two sets of charges must be treated separately, Ms Tutwiler said. The allegations have worsened relations between the US and Israel, already at odds over the US refusal to provide loan guarantees unless the Israelis stop building new settlements in occupied Arab territories. The alleged transfer of Patriot technology came to light in a leaked intelligence report. Mr Dick Cheney, defence secretary, said he had 'good reason' to be-lieve the report. But Ms Tutwiler said a 17-member team sent to Israel to investigate the matter had 'found no evidence that Israel had transferred a Patriot missile or Patriot missile technology.' The separate charges of numerous violations of US export controls were contained in a report issued on Wednesday by the State Department's inspector general, Mr Sherman Funk. He contended that there had been 'a systematic and growing pattern' of unauthorised sales of a major recipient of US military assistance. He did not refer specifically to Israel, but administration officials acknowledged privately that it was Israel. It was suggested that the two major recipients of the arms were South Africa and China. The investigation of the Patriot transfer was 'a stand-alone, separate mission' which must not be confused with the inspector general's report, Ms Tutwiler said. The Bush administration has been admonished by Mr Bill Clinton - the leading contender for the Democratic party's presidential nomination - for 'browbeating' Israel over its settlements policy. As a result, the arms transfer controversy has been handled very gingerly. In Jerusalem earlier, Israel repeated its denial that it had sold US arms and technology to countries such as China and South Africa in the face of US and international prohibitions. Israeli officials continued to demand a public retraction of allegations by the US. 'Our policy is to adhere strictly to the procurements and technology transfer agreements,' said Mr Danny Naveh, spokesman for Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister. The Israeli government is bracing itself for much tougher scrutiny of US arms and technology transfers, on which the Israeli defence forces and military industries have come to depend. The military is worried it may become subject to sanctions on some technologies to which it wants access to maintain Israel's 'qualitative edge' over its Arab foes. Despite the official denials, the US moves have forced Israel to be somewhat more open about its secretive military exports.</p>

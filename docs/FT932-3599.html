			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Malawians vote on democracy THE LIFE presidency of one of the world's most durable absolute rulers goes on the line today when Malawi votes on western-style democracy, Reuter reports from Blantyre. Dr Kamuzu Hastings Banda has run the tiny southern African nation like a private estate since independence from Britain in 1964. But he has been forced by internal unrest and western pressure over abuses of power to hold a referendum on whether Malawi remains a one-party state or permits opposition parties. The nonagenarian Ngwazi (conqueror) - officially he is 87 but is widely believed to be around 95 - predicts the roughly 4m voters will endorse his paternal autocracy. An opposition alliance is equally confident that Malawians have woken up from years of oppression to a new dawn of democracy creeping over Africa. Whatever happens, diplomats say it is unlikely Dr Banda's old style of government, which critics say brooks no opposition on pain of detention or even death, can survive. Western donors who keep the nation afloat are withholding all except humanitarian assistance in protest against human rights violations. Malawians have shown unprecedented resistance to the ruling Malawi Congress Party (MCP) - rioting a year ago killed about 40 people. Even the old president has appeared to acknowledge he cannot go on as before. At one rally he conceded there was more than one side to debate. The Alliance for Democracy (Aford) is campaigning for a multi-party vote with the United Democratic Front (UDF) led by Mr Bakili Muluzi, a sacked former minister . In event of a victory, the opposition wants a national unity government set up within a week to draw up a democratic constitution and a bill of rights.</p>

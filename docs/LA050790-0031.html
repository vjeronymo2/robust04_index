			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'A NIGHTINGALE SANG' RINGS WITH NOSTALGIA AT OLD GLOBE  </P> <P> Calling Vera Lynn.  </P> <P> The British singer, whose distinctive voice and mellow songs saw thousands of  Britons through the blitz and bombs of World War II and who became the  unofficial emblem of an era, is about all that's missing from Craig Noel's  tender production of "And a Nightingale Sang" at the Old Globe.  </P> <P> It's nostalgia time.  </P> <P> C. P. Taylor's wartime reminiscence, which opened Thursday, will remind older  viewers of such World War II film sagas as Noel Coward's "In Which We Serve" or  the throbbing Vivien Leigh-Robert Taylor starrer, "Waterloo Bridge":  bittersweetness with an edge.  </P> <P> The edge here is a solid-gold ensemble of Old Globe familiars, headed by Kandis  Chappell (who would brighten a recitation of the Yellow Pages on a rainy day)  and including the superior character skills of Katherine McGrath, Mitchell  Edmonds, Jonathan McMurtry and Lynne Griffin.  </P> <P> The staging is beautifully calibrated by Noel and lovingly detailed by scenic  designer Kent Dorsey, Jeff Ladman's vivid sound score, Lewis Brown's  period-perfect costumes and Peter Maradudin's pools of light.  </P> <P> Dorsey cleverly sets his working-class interior within a cut-out of the house  -- complete with chimney tops -- backed by a sky made up of headlines of the  period.  </P> <P> Would that such stylishness all around served a less predictable script. For  all of Taylor's fondness, "Nightingale" is sitcom with a touch of soap, a  well-made comedy that chronicles the eccentricities of a spunky working-class  family in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne during the war years, long on individual quirks  and short on surprises.  </P> <P> We follow the fortunes of the Stott family mostly through the eyes and voice of  the lame older daughter, Helen (Chappell). The madcap household (what do they  work at?) consists of Helen's ever-cheerful if quite enigmatic father, George  (Edmonds), who seems to live and develop spontaneous political theories at his  piano; Helen's giddy younger sister, Joyce (Griffin), who can't decide if she  wants to marry soldier-boy Eric (James Lancaster) or stay married to him after  the fact; Helen's itinerant grandfather Andie, who mopes around, punctuating  the comedy with truisms as he sashays in and out of their lives (McMurtry in  one of his more delicious old-man takes) -- and Helen's "Mam" Peggy (McGrath),  a devoutly hysterical churchwoman born to worry about the lot of them.  </P> <P> No such play would be complete without a taciturn stranger (played with  tenderness and just enough mystery by Alan Brooks), entering the household as  Eric's buddy and invading Helen's plucky heart. It's a bittersweet romance with  foreseeable turns of events. Which is precisely the problem.  </P> <P> Despite its individually touching funny or spirited scenes (there's no lack of  spirit in this production), "Nightingale" as a play sails too smoothly from  point A to point Z.  </P> <P> With the exception of Helen -- and, arguably, of her lover -- the characters  neither grow nor reveal much more of themselves by the end than they did at the  start.  </P> <P> This complacency shrinks the show to the level of feel-good theater --  palliative panorama. Nothing requires that we participate -- or be moved. We  watch, smile, laugh, go home, forget. Might as well turn on the telly.  </P> <P> Nice. But the Old Globe usually demands better and more from its audience. And  should.  </P> <P> At the Simon Edison Centre for the Performing Arts in Balboa Park, Tuesdays  through Saturdays, 8 p.m. (except May 23-24); Sundays and June 5, 7 p.m.;  matinees Saturdays and Sundays at 2. Ends June 10. $20-$27.50; (619) 239-2255.  </P> <P> </P></p>

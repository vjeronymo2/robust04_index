			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Boutros Ghali calls on Nato to step in Following is the text of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali's letter sent to Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, on Sunday and to members of the UN Security Council: I have the honour to refer to resolution 836 adopted by the United Nations Security Council on 4 June 1993. In paragraph 9 of that resolution the Security Council authorised the United Nations protection force (Unprofor), in carrying out the mandate conferred on it by paragraph 5 of that resolution '. . . . acting in self-defence, to take the necessary measures, including the use of force, in reply to bombardments against the safe areas by any of the parties. . . . ' The safe areas had been declared by the Security Council in its resolution 824 of 6 May 1993. They included Sarajevo. In paragraph 10 of resolution 836, the Security Council further decided that '. . . . member states, acting nationally or through regional organisations or arrange-ments, may take, under the authority of the Security Council and subject to close co-ordination with the secretary-general and Unprofor, all necessary measures, through the use of air power, in and around the safe areas in Bosnia-Hercegovina, to support Unprofor in the performance of its mandate set out in paragraphs 5 and 9 above.' In the declaration of the heads of state and government participating in the meeting of the North Atlantic Council held at Nato headquarters, Brussels, on 10-11 January 1994, the heads of state and government inter alia reaffirmed their 'readiness under the authority of the United Nations Security Council and in accordance with the alliance decisions of 2 and 9 August 1993, to carry out air strikes in order to prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo, the safe areas and other threatened areas in Bosnia-Hercegovina.' You subsequently informed me that, whereas the North Atlantic Council had already authorised close air support, a further decision would be required for it to authorise air strikes. I supported this position to the Security Council in my letter of 28 January 1994 addressed to its president. The mortar attacks last week against civilian targets in Sarajevo, at least one of which has been established by Unprofor to be the work of Bosnian Serb forces, make it necessary to prepare urgently for the use of air strikes to deter further such attacks. I should be grateful, therefore, if you could take action to obtain, at the earliest possible date, a decision by the North Atlantic Council to authorise the commander-in-chief of Nato's southern command to launch air strikes, at the request of the United Nations, against artillery or mortar positions in or around Sarajevo which are determined by Unprofor to be responsible for attacks against civilian targets in that city. The arrangements for the co-ordination of such air strikes would be elaborated through direct contacts between Unprofor headquarters and Nato's southern command, as has already been done in the case of close air support for the self-defence of United Nations personnel in Bosnia and Hercegovina. I am today informing the members of the Security Council that I have addressed the above request to you.</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (5): Germany starts to open up - The international investor is at last being courted The latest stage in the privatisation of Lufthansa, the German national airline, is being welcomed by international bankers and investors as evidence that they are finally being allowed to participate fully in one of the world's richest but hitherto closed markets. Germany's relatively small stock market and the intricate cross-holdings between the country's companies have long prevented foreigners from building up significant investments. As a result, the weighting of German equities in many international portfolios is very low relative to the size of the German economy. But the ever-stronger need for capital by the German corporate sector as it emerges from recession can no longer be met exclusively by the German state and the country's powerful banks. In addition, domestic institutional investors show no signs of making a radical departure from their traditional preference to hold bonds, even in the wake of the poor performance of the German government bond market this year which has seen yields on 10-year paper rise to 7 1/2 per cent, the highest level since September 1992. This scenario has prompted German companies and the government belatedly to court the international investment community. The government is believed to be keen to make the sale of its shares in Lufthansa an international event and Dresdner Bank, which is co-ordinating the domestic and international offerings, has appointed a large group of international banks to ensure a wide placement of the shares. The government intends to reduce its stake in Lufthansa from 51.4 per cent to about 41 per cent by not participating in a forthcoming rights issue. The 3.9m shares which the government will not be taking up will be sold to investors in Germany and abroad, excluding the US. Some foreign bankers have criticised the decision to exclude US investors this time round, because their absence will dilute the international importance of the transaction. Lufthansa has decided not to place shares in the US under Rule 144A of the US Securities Act, in order to limit the risk of excessive foreign ownership which could jeopardise its flag carrier status. US investors, however, are likely to be included when the government disposes of the rest of its shareholding, which is scheduled to take place before the end of 1995. If investor demand is sufficiently buoyant, the government also intends to sell a further 2.1m existing shares which would reduce its stake in Lufthansa to 36 per cent. Since Dresdner will be using the so-called 'book-building' process, the scale of the demand will be far easier to judge. Bookbuilding involves collecting investors' bids for the shares, thus helping to establish the most appropriate selling price. By matching the demand for and the supply of the shares on offer, bankers hope to avoid excessive volatility in the shares when they start trading in the secondary market. Bookbuilding also provides greater shareholder transparency which Lufthansa currently lacks because its shares are in bearer rather than registered form. The timing of the sale coincides with a sharp turnaround in Lufthansa's fortunes. This has been reflected in a doubling in its share price over the past year. That has prompted some concern among investors that they will be buying the shares at the top of the market and at a time when global competition among airlines is becoming increasingly fierce. The government is no doubt aware of these concerns but bankers believe that the new shares will be priced at only a marginal discount to the prevailing market price. However, since the government is keen for the Lufthansa sale to be an international success, it may scale back the sale of its existing shares in order not to flood the market. Although the Lufthansa sale is only likely to raise just over DM1bn, it is an important event because it is in effect the dry run for the long-awaited privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, Germany's telecommunications company. Market valuations of the company range from DM60bn to DM100bn which suggest that the sale of the first tranche of the shares could yield between DM15bn and DM20bn. But investors are likely to have to wait until late 1995 or even 1996 before the shares come up for sale. In the meantime, Germany's small, privately-owned companies are jumping on the international bandwagon with enthusiasm. In September, Fliemann, a fast-growing manufacturer and retailer of spectacles, raised just over DM200m through the sale of non-voting preference shares to domestic and international investors. Around one-third of the shares went to international investors and BZW, which was involved in arranging the offering with lead manager WestLB, reported heavy demand as foreigners sought to gain an exposure to Germany's buoyant retail sector. Bankers believe that German companies have become far more comfortable with the concept of making their shareholder base more international. Indeed, some believe that foreigners are more likely to be long-term shareholders than their domestic counterparts who are seen to be more speculative. This more open attitude should lead to a greater volume of international equity issuance from Germany.</p>

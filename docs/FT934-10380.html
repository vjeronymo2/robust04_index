			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Bellway up 28% on the back of rising house sales PRE-TAX profits at Bellway, the north-east-based housebuilder, jumped 28 per cent to Pounds 16.73m during the 12 months to the end of July. The company was helped by a rise in sales to private house owners and to housing associations which this year have benefited from increased government aid. Turnover rose by 13 per cent to Pounds 147.16m on the back of a record 2,299 house sales, a rise of almost a quarter on the 1,841 sold the previous year. Mr Kenneth Bell, chairman, said the company proposed to increase its final dividend by 0.5p to 8p, in line with the forecast made when it raised Pounds 33.6m in a 2-for-7 rights issue in February. That makes a 12p (11.5p) total. To improve the marketability of its shares Bellway is recommending that the 25p ordinary shares be split into 12.5p units 'to double the number of shares in issue.' Mr Bell said operating margins during the 12 months had risen by almost a fifth, from 8.3 per cent to 9.9 per cent, reflecting the benefit of higher sales volume and also the replacement of more expensively bought land which had been acquired during the late 1980s. The company's share price slipped 2p to 455p after the results. This compares with an issue price of 320p at the time of the rights offer. The group intends to use its improved financial muscle - it had net cash of Pounds 44m at the end of July - to expand sales. Since the summer it has committed a further Pounds 30m on land acquisitions. The number of plots owned by the group with planning permission has risen from 5,500 since July 1991 to about 10,000 currently. The number of sites from which the group sells has risen from about 100 to 120. COMMENT Bellway, like Wilson Bowden, has used rights issue cash raised in 1991 and again this year to finance expansion. Sales are planned to rise to 4,000 a year in England and in Scotland by the mid-1990s. Any short-fall on housing association work in the current year should be more than made up in improved private sector sales as the number of sites the group operates from continues to expand. Margins are on the mend and should improve further as the housing market recovers. The balance sheet also is in good shape. Bellway deserves its premium rating with pre-tax profits likely to reach Pounds 22m to Pounds 23m in 1993-94 but its strengths are already recognised in the share price.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Deputy Defense Minister  Mordekhay Gur said tonight that Hamas is succeeding in carrying  out painful attacks, but is not in control in the territories.  He said that Israel rejects the conditions presented by Hamas  for a cease-fire, and regards them as a provocation. Hamas  leaders want to present themselves as negotiating with Israel,  but we chose to negotiate with the PLO because it is the main  force in the Palestinian street, Gur said.

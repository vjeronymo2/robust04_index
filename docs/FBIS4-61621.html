			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 7 TASS--A joint statement of public  relations centers of the Russian Federal Counter-Intelligence  Service and the Interior Ministry was made here today to comment  on recent media reports claiming a "certain confrontation"  between the two institutions, including the Counter-Intelligence  Service's explosion of "a criminal group of high-ranking  staffers of the Interior Ministry".    "The Federal Counter-Intelligence Service has detained an  ex-  staffer of the Moscow Regional Interior Department's Punishment  Execution Division (dismissed in April 1994) and a senior  investigator of the Russian Interior Ministry's Investigation  Committee on charge of currency rules' violation (Article 88 of  the Russian Criminal Code), abuse of office (Article 170) and  bribing (Article 174, part 1). They have been arrested," says  the document.    "A staffer of the bar has been arrested on charge of bribing  (Article 174, Part 1). His case will be investigated by the  Russian procurator general's office. All the three were charged  on May 6. None of high-ranking staffers of the Russian Interior  Ministry is involved in this case," it stresses.    "The Russian Federal Counter-Intelligence Service and the  Interior Ministry would like to draw attention to joint actions  of the Service and the Ministry as regards this case. This is a  regular practice. The stand of Service and Ministry heads on  corruption, abuse of office and other crimes committed by their  staffers is clear: Reliability and pure morals of staffers and  security of services are topical for the whole law-enforcement  system.    "Exposure and prevention of corruption in the  law-enforcement  bodies and other state structures are direct duties of counter-  intelligence and interior bodies, their work to ensure national  security envisaged by the current legislation.    "Coordinated efforts of the law-enforcement bodies and  secret  services, interaction and close cooperation of interior bodies  and counter-intelligence are the main condition, obligatory and  natural element of their successful measures, in particular  those against dangerous crimes.    "Staffers of the Interior Ministry and the Federal Counter-  Intelligence Service have held a number of successful joint  operations to stop activities of many dangerous criminal groups  involved in illicit drug trafficking, arms sales and antics  contraband. The comprehensive operations of Putina, Tral and  Arsenal were a success.    "In this connection public relations centers of the Russian  Interior Ministry and the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service  think that rumors claiming confrontation and the "war of  monsters"--the Ministry and the Service, are nothing but a  provocation that affects the common cause, measures against  crime and corruption, provision of security of individuals,  society and the state," says the statement.</p>

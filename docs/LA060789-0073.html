			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WAXMAN DROPS BID TO BECOME MAJORITY WHIP, SUPPORTS GRAY  </P> <P> Rep. Henry A. Waxman of Los Angeles on Tuesday pulled out of the race for House  majority whip, the third-ranking spot in the House Democratic leadership,  saying that he entered the contest too late and his candidacy might divide the  Democratic Party.  </P> <P> The key job opened up when Rep. Tony Coelho of Merced decided to retire from  Congress rather than face an ethics inquiry related to his purchase of a  $100,000 junk bond.  </P> <P> Waxman, an influential liberal who had hoped to retain the leadership post for  a Californian, said that it would have been "very, very tough" to pry his  colleagues away from commitments they have made to three other candidates in  recent weeks.  </P> <P> "Entering the race at this late date poses difficult and perhaps insurmountable  obstacles," he said. "Since many colleagues have already given commitments to  the other candidates, I fear that my candidacy could serve to divide our party  and keep us from a smooth transition to a new leadership team."  </P> <P> Waxman threw his support to Rep. William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania, the  leading candidate to succeed Coelho. Gray, who heads the House Democratic  Caucus and is the highest-ranking black member of the House, is competing for  the post with Rep. David E. Bonior of Michigan, the deputy whip, and Rep. Beryl  Anthony Jr. of Arkansas, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign  Committee. A vote is planned later this month.  </P> <P> Waxman said Gray's candidacy would not be harmed by reports last week that the  Justice Department was conducting a preliminary criminal inquiry into his  office. Gray angrily denied that he is the target of an investigation and has  demanded that Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh investigate news leaks that led to  such stories.  </P> <P> Gray will be a "most valuable addition to the leadership team," said Waxman,  who had been urged to seek the whip job by other California House Democrats.  The post, which controls the flow and content of major House legislation, can  have a crucial impact on important California issues, such as clean air, AIDS  funding, immigration and highway construction.  </P> <P> Waxman will remain chairman of the powerful health and environment subcommittee  of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  </P></p>

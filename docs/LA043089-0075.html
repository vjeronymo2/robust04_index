			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HOUSING MODEL  </P> <P> The Oceanside City Council is to be commended for its precedent-setting  decision to provide emergency housing for low-income families in their  community. Their determination to proceed in the face of considerable hostility  and misunderstanding on the part of a very vocal opposition is both courageous  and enlightened.  </P> <P> So staggering are the problems of providing shelter for the homeless that it is  often easier to avoid taking action altogether, or to resort to inappropriate  action -- such as calling on the health department to drive migrant workers  from one encampment to another, without thought of the incredible hardship  being inflicted on innocent human beings. Instead, Oceanside and the good  sisters of Mission San Luis Rey, who provided the land, have chosen to light a  candle in the darkness. May their actions serve as a model for other  communities in San Diego County, which so far have failed to confront the  reality of the crisis in housing and the desperate need for practical and  humane solutions.  </P> <P> RAFAEL MARTINEZ  </P> <P> Encinitas  </P></p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Observer: Shake-out Meanwhile the mists have descended once more around the Drambuie Liqueur company, maker of the sweet whisky-based drink supposedly derived from a recipe invented by Bonnie Prince Charlie, which a year ago showed signs of emerging from corporate obscurity. At an elaborately staged press conference, the family-owned concern announced a new strategy of diversification, with its purchase of upmarket crystal-manufacturer Caithness Glass being heralded as the first of several acquisitions of Scottish companies making quality products. Spearheading the change was Peter Shakeshaft, brought in from packaging and games group John Waddington to be finance and development director under the brothers Calum and Duncan Mackinnon, who had recently taken over as joint chairmen of Drambuie after the death of their father, Norman. Bearded and an accountant by profession, Shakeshaft talked of building a 'good solid Scottish group' alongside the liqueur company 'over the medium to long term'. But the reticent Mackinnons were noticeably absent from the enunciatory proceedings. Now the 44-year-old import has resigned 'to pursue his own interests' but with no alternative job to hand. While he won't say why, it could be that he has found Drambuie distastefully resistant to being either shaken or stirred.</p>

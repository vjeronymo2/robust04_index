			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporter Hu Hsiao-i (5170 2556 </F> 0308): "Guangdong Province Seizes 140,000 Pirated Compact Discs  by Shock Tactics"]    [Text] Guangzhou, 20 Apr (TA KUNG PAO)--Beginning  yesterday at noon, in a concerted effort, more than 20 relevant  departments at the prefecture and city levels in the province  went out to take emergency action on an unprecedented scale to  crack down on illegal compact disc (CD) and audio-visual  products, achieving certain results.    As of noon today, the province has mobilized over 3,200  personnel to inspect more than 1,650 shops. They have seized  more than 141,000 pirated CD's, 1,300 laser discs, and 85,000  audio (video) tapes [as published]. A total of 10 stalls  without licenses were closed. In Guangzhou alone, approximately  60,000 pirated CD's and 2,700 pirated audio (video) tapes were  seized.    According to the person in charge of the Guangdong Province  Copyright Bureau, CD and laser discs rapidly developed and  became easily available only in the past two or three years.  Due to poor management, the low quality of those in the trade  -- who lack a clear understanding of copyrights -- and the  arrival of some manufacturers and individual operators who want  to reap huge profits from the audio-visual products market, the  phenomenon of pirating and theft in the audio-visual products  market in Guangdong and even the whole country is serious. In  order to safeguard the normal publication order, guarantee a  healthy cultural market, and strengthen propaganda for  protecting intellectual property rights in the province, this  concerted effort is only the beginning of a thorough inspection  of the audio-visual products market, and regular inspections  will henceforth be carried out.    The person also said that the China Press and Publications  Administration will promulgate the "Regulations on Inspection,  Registration, and Management of Compact Disk Copyrights"  shortly. The Guangdong Province Copyright Bureau will  incorporate the current 23 CD production lines in the province's  16 factories into the domain of management of press and  publications. In light of the relatively acute situation of  laser disc smuggling, the relevant department will coordinate  with the customs department in cracking down on smuggling and  blocking the sources. Stalls selling audio- visual products  must first apply for permits from the copyright bureau, which  will issue the business licenses, so as to strengthen the sense  of copyright law and understanding of the legal system among  stall owners.</p>

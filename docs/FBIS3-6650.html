			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] President Ramos has approved a comprehensive  development plan for Central Luzon involving the setting up of  industrial sites and the preservation of highly protected  farmlands in order to spur economic recovery and alleviate the  plight of the people displaced as a result of the eruption of  Mt. Pinatubo.    The president directed the members of Cabinet Cluster A and  all the local chief executives in the provinces of Bulacan,  Pampanga, Tarlac, Nueva Ecija, Bataan, and Zambales to  immediately meet and draw up a land use plan which will identify  areas suitable for industrial, residential, and agricultural  purposes.    Secretary Ernesto Garilao of the Department of Agrarian  Reform (DAR) reported yesterday that in a meeting of the Cabinet  Cluster A last Tuesday, it was initially decided that the new  program would be similar to the development plan for the  Calabarzon Provinces of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and  Quezon in Southern Tagalog.    President Ramos, Garilao said, wants to convert Central  Luzon  into another economic zone capable of providing adequate food  supply, job opportunities, and decent and affordable dwelling  units.    Garilao said under the proposed land use plan, concerned  local government units (LGUs) can promptly cite areas where  development projects such as low cost housing and industrial  centers can be established.    Likewise, it would also guide the LGUs in effectively  preserving prime agricultural lands mostly planted to rice,  corn, vegetables, and fruits.    He said the zoning plan aims principally to prevent the  failures on effective land use earlier encountered in Calabarzon  and involving mostly cases of unauthorized land conversion.    While problems cropped up in Calarbarzon because of  non-availability of a rationale and sustainable land use plan,  Garilao said, the development efforts, nonetheless, were proven  a big success as reflected in the total investments poured in  the area amounting to P [Philippine pesos] 140 billion from 1986  to 1993.    During the same period the total amount of investments  injected in Central Luzon reached only P30 billion, he said.    The Department of Trade and Industry has received  commitments  from both foreign and local capitalists to invest in Central  Luzon, he said.    Garilao said Tarlac, Pampanga, and parts of Zambales and  Bataan are among the areas where industrial sites can be set up  while Nueva Ecija and Bulacan could very well be tapped for  agricultural production.

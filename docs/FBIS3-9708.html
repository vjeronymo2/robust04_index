K.: "Hungarian President's Visit to Poland: </F> Motion Requesting Membership in Union"]    [Text] In the near future, Poland and Hungary will  introduce motions requesting recognition of their full  membership in the EU, said Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski  after his meeting with Hungarian President Arpad Goncz. The  Hungarian leader began his three-day visit to our state  yesterday.    Hungary will most likely introduce a motion regarding its  full EU membership by 1 April, and we will do so some time  later, added the chief of the Polish diplomatic service. He  also stated that, during an earlier meeting in the Belweder, the  Polish and the Hungarian presidents discussed, above all, the  international situation. Arpad Goncz and Lech Walesa agreed  that their views on the subject coincide entirely, stated  Olechowski.    Both leaders acknowledge that regional cooperation is a "key  goal" for the Middle and East European states. During his talks  with Lech Walesa, Hungarian President Arpad Goncz stressed that,  in addition to centrifugal forces, the Visegrad Group has  "stable prospects for future development."    Discussing cooperation among the Visegrad Group states,  President Lech Walesa stated that "some [states] do not want to  achieve some of the goals alone." He added that "not  everything develops the way we would like it to develop" because  "we are not doing things together."    At the Belweder, the Polish president awarded the Hungarian  guest with the Order of the White Eagle, and the Hungarian  president, in his turn, awarded Lech Walesa with the Hungarian  Great Cross of the Order of Honor.    Premier Waldemar Pawlak, who was received by the Hungarian  president at his residence, said that the subject of their  meeting was connected with political and economic cooperation  between the two countries. They also discussed the "Partnership  for Peace" program. Recalling the negotiations addressing the  Central European free trade area, the Polish prime minister  disclosed the wish to speed up the realization of this agreement.    President Goncz also met with Marshal of the Sejm Jozef  Oleksy. The Hungarian leader spoke in favor of the admission of  Slovenia and Croatia--after the war in former Yugoslavia is  over--to the Visegrad Group.    Minister Olechowski stressed that the "Partnership for  Peace"  program and joint efforts of NATO and the Middle and East  European states to begin cooperating in military areas serve the  faster rapprochement of the two states.    The chief of the Polish diplomatic service added that,  despite the closeness of their policies, the Hungarian and  Polish Governments differ in treating ethnic minorities.    "If the future of the Visegrad Group depended on only our  will, it would have developed dynamically," said Olechowski. In  his opinion, the governments of the two states believe that the  slowing down of the development within this group is only  temporary.</p>

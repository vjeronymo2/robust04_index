			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 8 COMMUNITIES MAY FORM WASTE-MANAGEMENT COMMISSION  </P> <P> Responding to warnings that the county may soon run out of places to bury its  trash, officials in Bellflower are recruiting seven neighboring cities to  devise a plan to handle the voluminous waste generated each day.  </P> <P> The Bellflower City Council's two-man waste management subcommittee has invited  the cities' officials to join a proposed waste-management commission.  Councilmen William J. Pendleton and Randy Bomgaars were appointed to the  subcommittee when it was formed one month ago.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Variety of Alternatives  </P> <P> The proposed commission, which would be patterned after a similar group in the  San Gabriel Valley, would look at a variety of waste-management alternatives,  such as recycling, waste reduction and the construction of a waste-to-energy  facility similar to the Long Beach and Commerce solid-waste incinerators,  officials said.  </P> <P> "It's apparent that we all are running out of space," Pendleton said in an  interview at City Hall last week. "It's getting worse. It's right in  everybody's face and we have to do something about it."  </P> <P> Pendleton and Bomgaars wrote to administrators and council members in Artesia,  Norwalk, Lakewood, Paramount, Downey, Hawaiian Gardens and Cerritos.  </P> <P> "One of the most pressing issues in American cities today is solid-waste  management," they wrote in the Jan. 31 letter. "Waste-management issues affect  us all, and perhaps working together, we can develop a better strategy and plan  for the future."  </P> <P> Downey and Paramount officials already have expressed an interest  </P> <P> in the Bellflower proposal, said administrative assistant Gonzalo M. Vazquez.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rail Line Suggested  </P> <P> Officials of the Los Angeles Sanitation Districts estimate that the county's 10  landfills will be filled by 1992. About 45,000 tons of trash are deposited in  landfills each day, said Donald S. Nellor, head of the Los Angeles County  Sanitation Districts' solid-waste management division. That figure is likely to  increase to 60,000 tons a day in three years, Nellor said.  </P> <P> "There will be no place for cities to put their trash in the very near future,"  said Nellor, whose agency has suggested a rail line be built to haul trash to  unoccupied desert areas.  </P> <P> Pendleton, an outspoken advocate of controversial waste-to-energy technology,  will attend a waste-management conference in Miami this week to study various  options to meet the growing trash problem.  </P> <P> The two-day "Resource Recovery" conference, which begins Thursday, is sponsored  by the National League of Cities, and will be a forum for city officials  throughout the country to discuss a broad range of waste-management issues and  problem-solving technology.  </P> <P> Pendleton, who is a customer service supervisor for Southern California Edison,  said he would rather see the city fund a waste-to-energy incinerator to reduce  solid waste.  </P> <P> Waste-to-energy incinerators, such as facilities in Commerce and Long Beach,  burn tons of municipal garbage and convert the heat into electricity, which is  bought by the local electric company for resale to customers.  </P> <P> Pendleton, whose decisions as a councilman may ultimately benefit Edison, the  local electric utility, said that he saw no conflict of interest in his  involvement in the subcommittee. He added, however, that he would resign from  the subcommittee if City Atty. Maurice F. O'Shea says that there might be a  conflict of interest.  </P> <P> Although the two facilities have been praised by some city and county officials  for lowering the amount of solid waste dumped into the county's 10 landfills,  others have been critical of the plants. They say that waste-to-energy  technology can pollute the air.  </P> <P> In fact, the Commerce facility has been cited recently for repeatedly violating  air pollution limits. The South Coast Air Quality Management District has  denied the two-year-old facility full operating permits until plant operators  can reduce emission levels.  </P> <P> Last year the newly opened Southeast Resource Recovery Facility (SERRF) on  Terminal Island violated AQMD standards for excessive visible emissions during  testing. In November, a defect in a precast concrete wall caused the city to  postpone approval of the plant until the problem is corrected.  </P> <P> And two years ago, environmentalists, community leaders and local lawmakers led  a successful protest against a proposed incinerator in South-Central Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Robert Hattoy, a spokesman for the Sierra Club, said that even the most  advanced technology cannot fully guarantee that the environment will be  protected. "It is always the fear that the best technology available doesn't  always work," he said.  </P> <P> Hattoy suggested that recycling and waste reduction should be attempted before  public officials open new landfills or build waste-to-energy facilities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Considering Options  </P> <P> Pendleton and Bomgaars said they are considering a variety of options as they  develop a waste-management plan for the city. But each clearly has his own  philosophy for battling the growing trash problem.  </P> <P> Pendleton prefers a waste-to-energy facility over recycling, and has suggested  that the Puente Hills landfill would be "an ideal spot." The city's disposal  company, Cal-Sans Inc., now hauls all city trash to the Puente Hills landfill  in the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> "I am not as married to recycling as I am waste-to-energy," Pendleton said. The  major opposition to the technology, he said, stems from ignorance and  misinformation.  </P> <P> "A lot of people are not totally informed about what's going on," Pendleton  said, referring to the criticism of the Commerce trash incinerator. "A lot of  opinion (against waste-to-energy technology) is formed through hysteria" over  small amounts of escaping pollutants.  </P> <P> "There is always a price to pay for technology," Pendleton said.  </P> <P> But Bomgaars, recognizing that waste-to-energy proposals are politically  volatile, said he would like the city to focus on "educating the community to  do more recycling on their own. We would have a very strong start (in lowering  trash volume) if we can get everyone involved."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Residential Recycling  </P> <P> Bomgaars, a public school teacher, also suggested that the board of directors  of the Sanitation Districts subsidize the additional cost of curb-side  residential recycling, which involves separating bottles, aluminum and paper  for delivery to a recycling plant.  </P> <P> About 20% of residential garbage is recycleable, said waste management expert  Nellor.  </P> <P> While acknowledging that a waste-to-energy plant "is an environmentally sound  alternative," Nellor said he has suggested that the Bellflower subcommittee  begin studying the feasibility of recycling residential trash.  </P> <P> He said that a good voluntary recycling program could involve about 40% of the  city's households. Recycling much of the trash could extend the use of the  current landfills for several years.  </P> <P> The Sanitation Districts' proposal to build a rail line to haul trash to  outlying areas was made at the request of a group of San Gabriel Valley cities,  which banded together in 1987 to discuss trash problems in that area of the  county.  </P> <P> As a result of that association, several San Gabriel Valley cities have adopted  recycling plans that have proven successful, Nellor said. Five cities --  Walnut, Arcadia, Duarte, Laverne and Claremont -- have residential recycling  policies. "Those cities are doing quite well" in lowering trash volume, Nellor  said.  </P> <P> West Covina and San Dimas have similar policies under consideration.  </P></p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Visit ends Hussein's isolation KING HUSSEIN of Jordan yesterday paid his first visit to Egypt in more than two years, signalling the kingdom's return to the Arab mainstream, writes Tony Walker in Cairo. Ostensibly, the Jordanian monarch flew to Cairo to offer condolences for victims of Monday's earthquake, but his mission had a broader significance. It effectively marks the end of the king's isolation in Arab councils. He had been ostracised by fellow-moderate Arab rulers incensed at Jordan's support for Iraq in the Gulf crisis.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Southend Property in Pounds 24.4m placing SOUTHEND Property Holdings yesterday joined in the spate of fund raising by property companies with the announcement of a Pounds 24.4m placing and open offer of 8 per cent convertible unsecured loan stock at 100p per unit. The company said that the issue would put it in a position to take advantage of acquisition opportunities. The issue was accompanied by the announcement of a forthcoming cut in its dividend from 4.25p this year to 2.4p for the year to the end of March 1994. The company said the decision to reduce the payment stemmed from the decline in its profits following the partial divestment of its non-core activities. The cut in dividend would also reduce the amount of irrecoverable advance corporation tax payable on future dividends. Mr Malcolm Dagul, chairman, and associated interests which together represent 22.6 per cent of the share capital, will not subscribe for their entitlement to Pounds 5.2m nominal of stock under the open offer. The stock may be converted on the basis of 117.647 shares per Pounds 100 nominal of stock in any of the years 1998 to 2020 at 85p per share. The terms represent a conversion premium of 3.5p per share, compared to Monday's share price. The offer has been made by Paribas on behalf of Southend.</p>

			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> POLICE PLAN TO CUT JAIL BOOKING FEES  </P> <P> The Ventura Police Department will try to cut down on bookings into Ventura  County Jail to reduce its payments to the jail, which recently started charging  fees, officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The County Board of Supervisors decided last month to offset state funding cuts  by charging cities about $120 each time their police officers book someone into  Ventura County Jail.  </P> <P> The fee will go into effect Jan. 1 but will be retroactive to July 1.  </P> <P> The new fees would cost the Ventura Police Department $400,000 to $500,000  annually, Lt. Pat Rooney said. But with cost-cutting measures, the department  believes that it can reduce the number of billable bookings into the jail by  two-thirds, he said.  </P> <P> Under the new policy set forth by Police Chief Richard F. Thomas, the  department itself will handle felony offenders who are to be released on their  own recognizance or released after posting bail. Offenders thought to be  dangerous or likely to commit another crime will still be taken to County Jail,  Rooney said.  </P> <P> "If the subject is dangerous, of course they're going to be booked," he said.  </P> <P> In misdemeanor cases, the department routinely cites and releases some  offenders rather than taking them to jail. Misdemeanor offenders are put into  the jail only under certain conditions, such as having an outstanding arrest  warrant or failing to provide satisfactory proof of identification, Rooney  said.  </P> <P> The department will now have sergeants monitor misdemeanor arrests more  carefully to make sure that no one is placed in the jail who does not fit those  conditions, Rooney said.  </P> <P> The new policy is temporary. Police will be evaluating its effectiveness in  meeting safety needs and reducing booking costs, according to a statement  issued by Thomas. CAROL WATSON  </P></p>

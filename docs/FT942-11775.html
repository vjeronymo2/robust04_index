			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Institutional unease over Lasmo bid terms Shareholders in rival explorers Enterprise Oil and Lasmo were yesterday expressing unease over the terms and structure of Enterprise's hostile Pounds 1.5bn offer. Some of the largest institutional stakeholders say they are not yet convinced by Enterprise's arguments that it needs to reach a 'critical mass' in order to increase the return to both companies' shareholders in a climate of low oil prices. 'Enterprise would have to put together a more compelling argument for merging the two businesses,' said one institutional investor in both companies. Enterprise yesterday posted its offer documents to Lasmo shareholders, prompting Mr Rudolph Agnew, Lasmo chairman, to charge that the bid 'smacks of desperation and the pursuit of size for its own sake'. Shareholders' main concerns appear to be the valuation placed on Lasmo, which so far excludes a cash alternative, the unusual equity structure and the timing of the bid. The offer of 27 Enterprise A shares and 12 warrants for every 80 Lasmo shares, in effect creates a new class of shareholder with limited dividend rights. One Enterprise shareholder said the equity structure prompted fears that the company was seeking to offset risk which it was not prepared to take. It 'raises suspicions that there may be something they might be worried about,' the investor said. Another institution suggested the paper offer may have overvalued Lasmo's assets. Enterprise says a cash element, either through a cash sweetener or underwriting arrangements, could be contemplated. But executives are concerned it would weaken its argument that the proposed financing arrangement gives Enterprise maximum flexibility to develop the combined assets of the two companies. Mr Andrew Shilston, Enterprise finance director, said yesterday that a cash bid 'forces you to run the assets for cash, and therefore doesn't give you scope to unlock all the value of the assets'. Enterprise is expected to try to persuade shareholders that an independent Lasmo will miss opportunities while it completes large development programmes, such as Liverpool Bay. But Mr Joe Darby, Lasmo chief executive, yesterday said 'he wouldn't be too happy' spending much more than the Pounds 50m a year on exploration and assessment given the uncertainty over prices.</p>

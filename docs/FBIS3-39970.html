And if Turkey is facing certain  difficulties at present, this is because of the coups it had  underwent."    Speaking to the press after a ceremony, President Demirel  said "let the democratic institutions, its army, and people of  the country alone."    "Everything is being discussed at parliament. A government  which has received a vote of confidence is on duty, whether you  like it or not. An independent court system is in effect. The  press is free and on duty. I am serving the country as the  president elected by this country's parliament."    "We might have certain problems but who doesn't?"    "I am making a call to everyone, since there are debates on  whether a coup will be made in Turkey," he said.    "I am addressing everyone. The regime is functioning in  Turkey. Here I am representing democracy and national  sovereignty and advise everyone to mind their own business."    Asked if a statement made a day before by Deputy Premier  Murat Karayalcin that a coup might occur in Turkey has a special  importance, President Demirel said, "I am not going to interpret  words said by someone else. You should listen to what people  have said before and after. There is no meaning in isolating  the word coup from the whole statement."    In May 27, 1960 a coup has been made by the Turkish Army and  the premier and his two friends have been executed. In March  12, 1971 another coup took place. The third coup of the Army was  made on September 12, 1980.</p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Allianz to maintain 22.3% stake in Dresdner IN A MOVE that bears witness to growing competitive pressures in the German insurance market, Germany's cartel authorities yesterday ruled that Europe's largest insurance group, Allianz, does not have to scale back its 22.3 per cent stake in Dresdner Bank, Germany's second largest bank. The original decision was seen by many observers as a declaration of war on two of Germany's most powerful institutions as they laid plans for increased business co-operation. However, the Berlin-based Bundeskartellamt said yesterday the competitive landscape had changed since March when it first told Allianz to reduce its stake in the bank to just over 19 per cent. Cartel authorities cited Deutsche Bank's and Assurance Generales de France's (AGF) recent purchases in the German life insurance sector. These acquisitions by large, financially strong institutions, had intensified competition and ensured Allianz no longer had a dominating market position, the Bundeskartellamt said. At the beginning of this month, Deutsche announced the purchase of a controlling stake in Deutsche Herold Versicherungs, a family-controlled insurance group, and in July it bought a 30 per cent stake in Gerling, the largest privately-owned insurance company in Germany. The Gerling deal received Cartel approval yesterday. Also in July AGF, one of France's biggest insurance groups, won a struggle to have its voting rights recognised on a 25 per cent-plus stake in Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), Germany's second-biggest insurance company. The authorities said another reason behind the change of heart was that Allianz had reduced its direct holding in Hamburg-Mannheimer Lebensversicherung, Germany's second biggest life insurance company.</p>

Dialogue is the only reasonable prospect for resolving  all the pending issues, otherwise the crisis will worsen and we  risk following the tendency toward chaos that has emerged in the  Balkans. I believe that we will be able to find a good solution  to all the issues dividing us, either by resolving them one by  one, or with a package of comprehensive measures." To do this  "it is necessary to have a different attitude, as well as the  awareness that propaganda and emotionalism harm both parties."  Gligorov, along with Bosnian [President] Izetbegovic, was  behind the last attempt to save some sort of Yugoslavia (June  1991), which was sabotaged by Croatia, Serbia, and Slovenia.  Home to a minuscule Serb minority, Macedonia has so far escaped  the fate of Bosnia. Nevertheless, we asked him what would  happen to a multiethnic (Slav and Albanian) Macedonia if Bosnia  too were divided along ethnic lines. He was keen to confirm  that Macedonia was different, in that it had a secular tradition  of Slav-Albanian cohabitation. So what about the paramilitary  network of Albanian separatists discovered in December, along  with weapons and a list of 20,000 names? "An isolated  incident." Gligorov also thinks that it is "impossible" that  Serbia and Albanians from Tirana or Kosovo would settle their  territorial quarrels in the same way that Belgrade and Zagreb  tried to resolve the Krajina question: i.e., by devouring a  third state (in that case Bosnia, in this case Macedonia).  Indeed, he is convinced that, despite certain unfavorable  prognoses that have appeared in the press (some of which are  attributed to the CIA), "there is a prevailing awareness that  stability in Macedonia is a condition for peace in the Balkans."  For this reason, the United States will also recognize Macedonia.</p>

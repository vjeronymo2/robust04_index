			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu by </F> unidentified reporter in Asuncion; date not given]    [Excerpts] [ABC COLOR] We do not know much about Romania.  We only know about Dracula and (former dictator Nicolae)  Ceaucescu.    [Vicaroiu] Dracula, Ceaucescu, (gymnast) Nadia Comanecci,  and  (tennis player) Ilie Nastase.    [ABC COLOR] Of course, there are other well-known names.    [Vicaroiu] It is true, little is known about Romania. It is  understandable because of the great distance separating us.  Before 1989, Romania was a totalitarian state ruled by  Ceaucescu.    [ABC COLOR] We have heard there are a lot of similarities  between the Romanian and Paraguayan processes, particularly  because of their dictatorships, which are now being followed by  transition processes...    [Vicaroiu] We have things in common. Both processes began in  1989. Both countries have encountered many difficulties in  their reform processes. We also suffered a lack of capital,  inflation, the privatization process, social costs... [passage  omitted]    [ABC COLOR] How was Romania's democratization process  carried  out? Who participated in it?    [Vicaroiu] The main protagonists were those involved in the  events. They organized a sort of provisional government. A  strategy was drawn up immediately after the revolution for the  radical transformation of Romania based on democratic values.    [ABC COLOR] What did that strategy involve?    [Vicaroiu] We drafted a new Constitution using the technical  assistance of experts from the most democratic countries in the  world. Then we worked out specific legislation on market  economy and began a process to eliminate all state intervention  in productive activities. We also distributed land among the  peasants.    [ABC COLOR] What happened with Ceaucescu's former government  officials? The fall of the dictator must have looked like a ray  of sunlight in an area of eternal darkness.    [Vicaroiu] Some went their own way during the privatization  process, others retired with pensions, while some others are  participating in the construction of democracy because the  people were not responsible for what happened.    [ABC COLOR] What do you mean by that?    [Vicaroiu] In Romania, by contrast to what happened in  countries around it, the Communist Party was more like a labor  union. It had more than 4 million members who paid money in  exchange for a secure job. [passage omitted]    [ABC COLOR] How does the reform process affect the  population?    [Vicaroiu] The reform had a very high social cost, just like  in any country going through a transition process. We have a  comprehensive program to reorganize and privatize the Romanian  economy. We have already finished the privatization of  agriculture. The privatization of industry is ongoing.    [ABC COLOR] How many companies have been privatized?    [Vicaroiu] To give you an idea, during the process we  created  some 380,000 companies with private capital. Of these, some  70,000 companies are based on foreign capital. So far we have  privatized hundreds of state-owned companies.    [ABC COLOR] Were the privatizations traumatic?    [Vicaroiu] We experienced a very difficult economic crisis.  When my government took over in November 1992, Romanian industry  was operating at 50 percent capacity. We introduced a series of  financial and monetary measures and started privatizing. The  decline stopped. In 1993, growth resumed. Agriculture has  grown 12.4 percent. We have launched a complex price, trade,  and foreign exchange liberalization process.    [ABC COLOR] How did the population react?    [Vicaroiu] We have very strong unions, perhaps the strongest  in Europe. Union members agree with the reform process, in  principle. But they also organize street demonstrations,  strikes...    [ABC COLOR] Union members organized a strike here this  month,  demanding "no to privatizations..."    [Vicaroiu] That is not the Romanian workers' position.  Unions are in favor of privatizations, but they naturally want  higher salaries, lower prices, more jobs...    [ABC COLOR] Are salaries freely negotiated? Do you have a  minimum salary?    [Vicaroiu] Salaries are freely negotiated between managers  and union leaders according to the financial possibilities of  companies. Our unions are not violent. We are in constant  discussion...    [ABC COLOR] What is your strategy to attract foreign  capital?    [Vicaroiu] Romania has aggressive new policies. One of the  essential conditions to overcome the crisis is to develop  bilateral relations with every nations in the world.    [ABC COLOR] Has the new democratic government spent more on  foreign relations, defense, interior affairs, or education?    [Vicaroiu] According to the budget, the state is only  responsible for financing infrastructure works, such as  highways, telecommunications, railways, ports, free trade  zones...    [ABC COLOR] How interesting is Paraguay for Romania?    [Vicaroiu] We are very interested in Paraguay and Latin  America. We are of Latin origin. We have things in common: the  language, civilization, traditions. We have complementary  economies and common economic potentials.    [ABC COLOR] In what are you specifically interested?    [Vicaroiu] Traditional products like cotton, soybeans,  ferrous minerals, and beef.    [ABC COLOR] What can Romania offer Paraguay?    [Vicaroiu] A great variety of industrial products like  planes, helicopters, ships, machines, and tools. We can also  offer textile, chemical, and fertilizer factories, and different  types of furniture, oil refineries...    [ABC COLOR] It is known that Paraguayan products end up in  former Communist countries, but deals are always made through  countries like Brazil.    [Vicaroiu] That will change. We can build a good furniture  factory here. We are the best in the world. Why can we not  install an urea factory in this country? We can make things  easier for businessmen.    [ABC COLOR] How does Romania compare with its competitors in  the manufacture of machines, tractors?    [Vicaroiu] We are exporting to the United States.    [ABC COLOR] Are Romanians interested in investing in  Paraguay?    [Vicaroiu] I am accompanied by more than 40 businessmen. We  have already signed some contracts. Each one must make a  profit...    [ABC COLOR] Can you balance your visit?    [Vicaroiu] Well, first, President Ion Illescu has officially  invited President Juan Carlos Wasmosy to visit Romania.  Meanwhile, we expect businessmen to negotiate new investments.  We also expect to receive Paraguayan congressmen and  businessmen.</p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE RETURN OF THE GREAT TOMATO;  </P> <P> IT'S BIG, IT'S RED AND IT TASTES GOOD TOO. SUN WORLD INTERNATIONAL'S NEW DIVINE  RIPE IS A BREAKTHROUGH IN TOMATO TECHNOLOGY  </P> <P> No fruit or vegetable has been more maligned than the modern tomato.  </P> <P> And with good reason.  </P> <P> The wonderful varieties that were sold in farmers' markets and roadside stands  are, for the most part, gone from today's grocery store. The rich flavor, deep  color and juicy texture of the classic beefsteak are distant memories.  </P> <P> But now a major breakthrough in tomato technology is occurring in Orange  County. The season's inaugural harvest of Sun World International's DiVine Ripe  began a few days ago on Irvine Ranch. This may be the finest tomato ever grown  commercially.  </P> <P> "Commercial tomato's flavor has traditionally been unacceptable," says David  Marguleas, marketing vice president for Sun World. Durability and shelf life --  two attributes highly prized by growers -- are probably responsible for the  tomato's decline in quality. The vast majority of fresh tomatoes is harvested  green and treated with ethylene gas to hasten color development. Only a small  percentage of the crop is actually vine-ripened.  </P> <P> Sun World, one of the produce industry's most innovative firms, decided to  change that. The Indio-based company began its search for tomato perfection in  the late '70s. They discovered that Israeli researchers were in the initial  stages of developing what was to become the patented DiVine Ripe seed.  </P> <P> The original challenge facing the researchers was to isolate the exact  constituents of superb tomato taste.  </P> <P> "I don't know of any instrument that will tell you whether a tomato's flavor is  good or bad," said Yakov Ben-Zion, President of LSL Biotechnologies, Inc., in  San Diego. (Under the current agreement, LSL conducts the research on DiVine  Ripe while Sun World handles production and marketing of the fruit.) "It takes  eight or nine painstaking years to develop a variety such as this."  </P> <P> Good tomato flavor is achieved by balancing the levels of sugar and acidity in  the fruit. Vine-ripened varieties are better than those picked green because  the sugar levels are not cut short by an early harvest and are allowed to  increase naturally.  </P> <P> Having attained the preferred flavor elements, the scientists were faced with  an equally difficult task: developing the proper firmness so that the tomatoes  could withstand the rigors of shipping.  </P> <P> "Vine-ripened is the way to go, but if you harvest at that stage of maturity  (partially red) then there are great difficulties in shipping the fruit," said  Marguleas. "Unless you can breed in the right amount of firmness, then all the  flavor achievements are for naught because you can't get the tomatoes to  market. Flavor and firmness are critical."  </P> <P> Ben-Zion is quick to point out that a firm tomato is not necessarily a bad one.  "You don't want the tomato so hard that it is like a rock," he says, "but it  still must hold its texture (in the week or more required to reach supermarket  shelves after harvest)."  </P> <P> The decade of research tailored the DiVine Ripe to temperate climates such as  Irvine's, which lacks extreme heat or wild temperature fluctuations. Orange  County is not as unusual a choice as it may seem: The 65,000 acre Irvine Ranch  has 10,000 acres designated as agricultural. "Southern California," Marguleas  said, "is one of the best growing areas for tomatoes in the United States."  </P> <P> Today, the success of the project is evident in the lush rows of five-foot-tall  vines bulging with fruit. Workers cut and gently place the tomatoes in wooden  crates lined with plastic bubble wrap. The tomatoes are then taken to a  processing shed where the fruit is washed, sorted for size and color  variations, adorned with a Sun World sticker and then packed for shipment.  </P> <P> The name may look familiar because the trademarked tomato was briefly available  twice in the past. In 1986 and again in 1988, Sun World distributed the  forerunner of the current variety. But although customers acclaimed the tomato,  the firm was not satisfied with the product. "The original DiVine Ripes were  not as perfect as we hoped," says Marguleas. "One of the imperfections was that  the tomato was (too) susceptible to cloud cover and it didn't color evenly."  </P> <P> The original varieties were also damaged by insects native to other crops in  the Irvine Ranch area, and yield per acre was disappointing. None of these  problems are surprising: Tomatoes are notoriously difficult to grow  commercially. "They had an awfully good tomato the first time around," says  Richard G. Spezzano, produce vice president for The Vons Companies. "But they  didn't get the consistency they were looking for."  </P> <P> The harvest of DiVine Ripe will continue through October, when the growing area  will be switched to Baja and other Mexican venues. By 1991, Sun World hopes to  have year-round national distribution of its tomato.  </P> <P> Sun World is not alone; a number of competitors are trying to develop a better  tomato using biotechnology. Other, less genetically intense programs are also  underway. The Vons Companies, according to Spezzano, are now offering a  vine-ripened tomato for the second year. They do this by contracting  wholesalers at the Los Angeles produce terminal each day to select the best  tomatoes available in terms of size, firmness and taste.  </P> <P> "The Vons' vine-ripened X-large," says Spezzano, "is a tomato we're quite proud  of." He indicated that he would consider offering the new Sun World tomatoes at  Vons as well.  </P> <P> As for the DiVine Ripe -- this is only the beginning. "It doesn't end here,"  says Ben-Zion. "There is no end in the quest for perfection."  </P> <P> Consumers can expect to see DiVine Ripe at gourmet or specialty stores in the  next two weeks. National distribution in selected supermarket chains will begin  in mid-August. Prices are expected to be between $1 and $2 per pound.  </P> <P>  RELATED STORIES: H11, H18, H27, H29  </P></p>

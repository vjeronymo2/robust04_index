			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It was learned on 27 February that the Ministry of  Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] plans to inaugurate in  fiscal year 1994 a "digital broadcasting technology development  office" under the Broadcasting Bureau's Engineering Division.  In a recent news conference, Broadcasting Bureau Director  General Akimasa Egawa said that the MOPT would not develop a  digital high-definition television (HDTV) system to replace an  analog system for the time being. Nevertheless, with the  setting up of the digital technology development office, the  ministry will become fully prepared for developing a digital  system.    During a news conference on 22 February, Egawa said: "Most  countries in the world are pursuing the research and development  of digital HDTV systems." He stressed the need for MOPT's  policy switch and called for replacing NHK's analog multiple  sub-Nyquist sampling encoding system with a digital system. His  remarks, however, created a great stir.    Because his comments brought protests from NHK and the  Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ), which is  selling analog TV sets, Egawa called another news conference the  next day and said: "Because of my lack of explanations, I have  caused a misunderstanding. For the time being, the MOPT will  continue supporting the NHK system." With this, the confusion  was unsnarled.    However, Egawa also said in the news conference that  "digital  technology directed toward the 21st century is necessary," thus  not denying the development of a digital system in the future.    According to the MOPT, the plan to set up the digital  technology development office was actively promoted by Egawa,  and the setting up of the office was decided on after a request  for changing the formation of the MOPT, which the ministry had  submitted together with a fiscal year 1994 budget request, was  approved.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: LME base metals prices move higher  -Market Report Base metals prices moved higher yesterday afternoon on the London Metal Exchange and, although there was some late profit-taking, all markets finished in the plus column with most set for further gains, dealers said. 'COPPER and ALUMINIUM found the going heavy at the highs, but are still looking good. They had the reactions earlier this week, and (three months delivery) aluminium should get above Dollars 1,500 (a tonne),' one said. The aluminium price closed yesterday at Dollars 1,497.50 a tonne, up Dollars 18.75 on the day, but ended the after hours session at Dollars 1,489. London Commodity Exchange COFFEE prices ended modestly firmer after a roller-coaster session that saw them test the downside after touching fresh 7 1/2 -year highs in early trading. The September futures position closed Dollars 25 up at Dollars 3,128 a tonne. 'We came back up on New York's regained strength,' said one trader. The market mood remained fundamentally very bullish and further gains were likely, others said, noting it was 'just the start of the frost period' in the southern hemisphere. Compiled from Reuter</p>

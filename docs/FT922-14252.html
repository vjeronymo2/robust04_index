			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Escudo makes firm debut UNEASY calm reigned over the UK foreign exchange market yesterday, with most activity centred on the smaller European currencies, writes Emma Tucker. The Portuguese escudo made its debut in the European Monetary System at a central rate of Ecu178.735, with a permitted divergence of 6 per cent above or below its central rate against other currencies. Backed by an attractive interest rate, the Portuguese unit rose rapidly to its ceiling against sterling - still the bottom-placed currency in the EMS - in early morning trading. Three-month interest rates stand at around 13 per cent in Portugal. Early intervention by the Bank of Portugal, which bought sterling and D-Marks, was followed by a cut in the bank's money market intervention rates. But the escudo remained firm, closing at 85.86/96 against the D-Mark after 85.57/67. This was above the 86.30/35 rate before Friday's announcement that the currency was to join the EMS. In Italy, the central bank intervened to support the lira, selling D-Marks and Ecus, as the first returns from Sunday's general election suggested that the Christian-Democrat alliance was going to lose its majority in parliament. The Italian currency declined against the D-Mark to L756.20/40, from L755.10/20 on Friday. The dollar drifted downwards in quieter trading than last week, with the high yield of the D-Mark plus the crawling pace of the US recovery conspiring to keep the US currency down. It added  1/2 pfennig to recent sharp losses in late trading as investors waited for the currency to go even lower before buying. Mr Nick Parsons at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said a much speedier economic recovery had been factored into the dollar, which climbed 9 1/2 per cent in the first six weeks of this year. He added: 'The scale and speed of that movement suggest there were some very exaggerated assumptions about the pace and scale of the recovery.' The US currency finished in London at DM1.6210, after a DM1.6245 start and a DM1.6290 Tokyo close. It slipped to Y132.75/85 from a Y133.14/24 opening. In New York the dollar improved to end at DM1.6255 and Y133.17. The Finnish markka stabilised yesterday after Friday's turmoil. It was helped by an emergency package of government spending cuts, a sharp rise in interest rates and a number of currency swap deals with European central banks. The pound, meanwhile, rested in the wings after last week's hectic trading. It weakened in the morning on news of the escudo's entry to the EMS but later stabilised. Dealers reported a big buy order for sterling, but it had little effect on the currency's rate, which closed at DM2.8375 after a DM2.8386 opening.</p>

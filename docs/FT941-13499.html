			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: ABB invests Dollars 300m in Indian operations ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the international electrical engineering company, will invest Dollars 300m in its Indian operations over the next two years as part of a restructuring and technology modernisation programme. ABB's investment, the largest by a multinational in India's manufacturing sector since the country embarked on economic reform in 1991, will be in three areas. Existing plants will be modernised, and new products introduced and upgraded. A power-plant manufacturing facility will be established, and a 'green field' unit will be set up, either in Gujarat or in Karnataka, to manufacture turbines for the power sector, with an investment of more than Rs2bn (Dollars 64m). The multinational, which will soon complete its merger with Flakt India, a Calcutta-based electrical engineering company, will make a series of strategic alliances, acquisitions, mergers and joint ventures to help it consolidate its position as a leading electrical engineering company in India. ABB has also offered to take over a struggling company, the Durgapur-based Associated Boilers (ABL), India's second-largest boiler manufacturer. ABL, formerly ACC Babcock, has accumulated losses of more than Rs1.3bn, and ABB is planning to pump in 'a large amount of money' to revive the company and take over management control, pending government approval. ABB is also seeking permission to part-acquire another company, the Bangalore-based New Government Electric Factory, an electronics manufacturer for the power industry which is jointly owned by the Karnataka government and AEG of Germany. When the restructuring is complete, ABB's India operations will then be in a position to challenge the near-monopoly of the state-owned Bharat Heavy Electricals in the manufacture of power plant equipment. ABB's annual income in India is expected to increase to at least Rs15bn by 1996-97, more than double the current group turnover of Rs7bn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has confirmed that he  has received three letters from Yasir 'Arafat over the last week  regarding the autonomy agreements and the difficulties on the  ground. Rabin said he answered the letters, but refused to  divulge details. Prime Minister Rabin told our correspondent  Shulamit Schmerling that Teddy Kollek presented him with the  idea of inviting King Husayn for prayers in Jerusalem, adding  that Rabin answered that if Kollek wanted to send the king a  personal invitation that was okay with him, but that he does not  know if the king would come.    Our correspondent adds Rabin confirmed that Jacques Neriya,  his political adviser, has decided to accept Hayim Ramon's offer  and take a post in the Histadrut labor federation. Rabin  expressed regret, but added that Neriya's resignation will not  have an adverse effect on the efficient operation of the prime  minister's bureau, just as the resignation of other advisers has  had no such effect. Yitzhaq Rabin admitted his working method is  military in nature, with channels of command and analysis  directing activities, and one adviser more or less makes no  difference.    Regarding another issue the prime minister said that the  government will no longer subsidize inefficient industries, and  henceforth those elements that wish to stand on their own two  feet -- whether a factory or a local authority -- will have to  become more efficient and finance themselves. The government  will not aid the local authorities any longer and they will have  to bear full responsibility for their budgets, according to the  prime minister. The prime minister made these remarks during a  meeting with northern mayors.</p>

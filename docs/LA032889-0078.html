			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Former Texas A&amp;M football Coach Jackie Sherrill's contract called for an  initial base salary of $95,000 when he was hired Jan. 6, 1982, but increased to  $185,120 by the time A&amp;M bought out his contract three months ago.  </P> <P> The Bryan-College Station, Tex., Eagle obtained a copy of Sherrill's contract  last week under the Texas Open Records Act. It showed that Sherrill also had a  separate arrangement with A&amp;M for his services on the "Jackie Sherrill  Show," a highlight program that ran weekly during football seasons. At the time  of the buyout, the talent contract was worth $142,000 a year.  </P> <P> The contract called for an automatic salary increase of at least 10% annually,  or the percentage increase of the average faculty salary, whichever was  greater.  </P> <P> Additionally, Sherrill received a month's base pay for each bowl appearance "in  order to compensate for the extra time needed to prepare for the appearance and  for the tangible benefit derived by (A&amp;M) from such appearance."  </P> <P> The university also provided Sherrill with a car and required him to be a  member of Briarcrest Country Club in Bryan -- at university expense -- because,  "It is the desire of the University that Sherrill be active in the affairs of  the community, maintain good alumni relations, vigorously recruit student  athletes, esteem himself socially and morally, act as a spokesman for the Texas  A&amp;M University Athletic Department."  </P> <P> In an agreement not mentioned in the contract, A&amp;M provided a five-year  $150,000 loan to Sherrill for the purchase of his home. Twenty percent of the  loan was written off by A&amp;M for each year Sherrill was employed.  </P> <P> Last September, the NCAA put A&amp;M on probation for two years for violations  of several regulations. A number of other sanctions were imposed but under the  terms of Sherrill's contract, the sanctions were not enough to cause his  dismissal.  </P></p>

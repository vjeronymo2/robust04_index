[Text] Your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent learned  yesterday from sources close to Russian counterintelligence some  details about the Russian SMM defense concern employee, arrested  by the counterintelligence organs, who had passed on secret  military information to British special services. It became  known in particular that the man suspected of spying since 1986  is Vadim Sintsov, director of an SMM administration. According  to information received by KOMMERSANT-DAILY, he was detained  with his partner, Mikhaylov.    KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned that the detained man, Vadim  Sintsov, used to be in charge of an administration in the USSR  Defense Industry Ministry. Following the collapse of the  ministries catering to defense, he joined the SMM concern as  head of one of the directorates for foreign economic  cooperation. His former colleagues in the concern characterize  Sintsov as an extremely sociable staffer. Besides, according to  one of his former colleagues, Sintsov was fluent in English,  knew computer technology well, and was brilliantly conversant in  the ways of the Russian armaments and military hardware market.    Yevgeniy Pershikov, SMM deputy president, in a talk with  your  KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent confirmed that the English spy  detained by the counterintelligence service had worked for the  concern, and was in charge of a directorate for foreign economic  relations. He stressed, however, that the SMM concern does not  possess any classified materials: "We have not had classified  materials for two years; even our first departments have been  closed down." Pershikov is confident that even if Sintsov was  indeed engaged in spying, he was doing so outside the concern.    That the detained man is precisely Vadim Sintsov was neither  confirmed nor denied to your correspondent at the Federal  Counterintelligence Service press center. A press service  officer explained that the English spy case is being  investigated by the military procuracy.    Your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent turned to the head of a  directorate of the Security Council apparatus to determine the  size of the damage and the nature of the information that Vadim  Sintsov had passed on to British special services. The official  said that, to his knowledge, Sintsov showed the greatest  activity in 1991 to 1993. However, he said, owing to the fact  that no important research and development projects were  undertaken by the defense sector at that time, British special  services used him in secondary roles: military information  coming to English intelligence services was checked up on  through him. Besides, Sintsov had no access to either materials  on the main defense development projects or to the secret  provisions of the military doctrine concerning its  military-technology section. "The value of information Sintsov  passed on to British special services has been artificially  overestimated. At any rate, the comparison to Penkovskiy and  Tolkachev is exaggeration," the Security Council apparatus  official thinks.</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / The Westminster Report: Council feels weight of damning criticism - Authority acted with 'disgraceful and improper purpose' / Effect on homeless people attacked Westminster city council yesterday suffered arguably the most damning criticism a district auditor has ever made of an English local authority. The Conservatives' local government flagship had in the provisional opinion of Mr John Magill, the district auditor, been guilty of 'gerrymandering' - defined by Collins dictionary as 'dividing constituencies of a voting area so as to give one party an unfair advantage'. It did so through its policy of 'designated sales', in which council houses were left vacant until they could be sold to middle-income families who would not otherwise have been able to buy their own home. The policy had been introduced in 1974, but only about 20 houses were sold each year. But in 1986 the Conservatives came close to defeat in the local elections, with their overall majority slashed from 26 to only four seats. In July 1987 the housing committee decided to expand the programme radically, with about 500 sales each year. Mr Magill has drawn up a report running to more than 200 pages which details his provisional findings. It is an offence under the Local Government Finance Act to reveal information gained by a district auditor in the course of his duty, and so it is not possible to quote from this. However, Mr Magill issued an 11-page statement about his provisional findings. He said in the statement that he believes a decision was made to move likely Conservative voters into marginal wards. Nine wards were identified as 'key' marginals and eight were later targeted as 'battlefield' wards. He said: 'Both the decision to increase the number of designated sales and the selection of the properties designated for sale were influenced by an irrelevant consideration, namely the electoral advantage of the majority party. I am minded to find as a fact that the electoral advantage of the majority party was the driving force behind the policy of increased designated sales and that this consideration was the predominant consideration which influenced both the decision to increase designated sales by 500 per annum and the selection of properties designated for sale. 'My provisional view is that the council was engaged in gerrymandering, which I am minded to find is a disgraceful and improper purpose, and not a purpose for which a local authority may act.' The attempt to gain political advantage was not the only element of the sales policy condemned by Mr Magill. His statement attacks both the consequences for the homeless in the borough, and the expense involved. He said: 'No local housing authority acting reasonably would adopt a policy, the anticipated consequences of which were that the number of homeless households placed in temporary accommodation would increase by 172 each year and that the net revenue costs to the council would increase, as a result, by over Pounds 1.5m in each succeeding year on the previous year's costs.' Westminster ignored both its statutory duties to the homeless, and even failed to consider the needs of 'Category A medical cases', who need to be rehoused urgently if their condition is not to deteriorate. According to professional valuations, the council lost Pounds 13.3m by selling the properties at a discount to their open-market values. Homeless families were put into temporary hotels while council flats were left vacant. Accommodation costs came to just over Pounds 2m. The housing committee also introduced a scheme of capital grants to existing secure tenants to purchase non-council accommodation. Mr Magill said his provisional view was that this was unlawful as the payments were not authorised by statute and such powers which the council had were exercised for a 'disgraceful and improper purpose'. The grants totalled Pounds 2.6m, he said. So many documents were printed to identify the best wards to target that Magill estimates the illegal expenditure on them at Pounds 5,000. Westminster council continues to argue that the policy is legal, citing opinion from a barrister in its support. Mr Miles Young, the new leader of the council, said the policy was intended to boost home ownership and support social cohesion in an area of the country where property prices were artificially high. However, Mr Neale Coleman, a former councillor and leader of the objectors who first called for the report, said that details of the report, which he had studied, made it 'absolutely clear' that the council's legal advice had been abused. Labour also said that Westminster had expanded its policy since Mr Magill started his work 4 1/2 years ago, to 'export' the homeless by housing them in newly built developments in outlying London boroughs. The 10 people named in the auditor's statement are Dame Shirley Porter, former leader of the council; Mr Barry Legg, former chief Tory whip; Mr David Weeks, council leader after Dame Shirley resigned in 1991; former councillors Mr Peter Hartley, Mr Michael Dutt and Ms Judith Warner; Mr Bill Phillips, former managing director; Mr Robert Lewis, former deputy city solicitor; Mr Graham England, housing director; and Mr Paul Hayler, divisional director in the housing department.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD DEATHS;  </P> <P> REALITY BROADSIDES FANTASY LAND  </P> <P> It is an axiom of plane geometry that two parallel lines, however long they may  run, never intersect -- never meet or touch or cross, in spite of the human  eye's optical illusion that they do.  </P> <P> Movies, film, television, all the incarnations of Hollywood, are supposed to  work much the same way. The lines -- reality and fantasy -- are not intended to  intersect. However realistic the fantasy tries to appear, the two are to be  kept apart.  </P> <P> This week, they have intersected. Reality has broadsided fantasy. In a city  where scripts often read like police reports, police reports read like scripts:  </P> <P>  -- A young actress, with an ingenue freshness that got her hired for the  kid-sister TV role that was her big break, is shot to death on her own  doorstep, perhaps by a deranged fan. She had returned home from Italy, filming  a miniseries about the brutal terrorist murder of a wheelchair-bound American  man aboard a cruise ship.  </P> <P>  -- A man with a grudge and a gun smashed his way into Lorimar Studios, shot up  a sound stage, then killed himself. He was a one-time business partner of a  "Dallas" TV show actor, a failed venture in the staple food of movie palaces,  popcorn. Lot workers said later that they thought it was a special-effects  stunt. Before he shot up Lorimar, the man handed the guard an envelop that held  a news article. Its headline: "Dreams, Feuds, Love, Lawsuits -- and Popcorn."  </P> <P>  -- A young bit actor who once appeared in a TV show about two highway  patrolmen who pursue and arrest evil-doers is killed on the spot when a  brand-new stolen Chevrolet being chased by police slammed into his car on a  street near Koreatown.  </P> <P>  -- And even as Shakespeare's grimmest dramas have moments of slapstick, a  sidewalk preacher in fine moral dudgeon over actor Rob Lowe's blue-movie porn  videotapes went to court to try to stop the actor from filming movie scenes in  the mid-Wilshire apartment building where the preacher lives. The preacher  lost.  </P> <P> The ripples have scarcely ceased moving through the sets and studios and office  suites of Hollywood.  </P> <P> "I think everybody in L.A. right now feels terrible -- everyone's talking about  it," said actress Theresa Saldana, who nearly died in a knife attack by a  deranged fan bent on killing her as his "divine mission." She has fought to  keep him in prison, and fought too for victims' rights.  </P> <P> They talk about coincidence. They talk about the triad mythology, that  disasters arrive in threes. They talk about the twin irritants of heat and  humidity. Even the moon. "Well," postulated one Lorimar worker, "it was a full  moon last night. That's one explanation for it."  </P> <P> Out at Lorimar, Bob Peacock, who works in the film lab, didn't see the  shooting, but around there, you never know "whether the sound of a gun is the  real McCoy -- it is the movie industry. If you were looking down on the stages  and saw some guy blowing up the wall with a gun, you wouldn't think anything  about it. They knew this was no act only when the cops showed up."  </P> <P> Said an executive on a daytime soap opera, whose actors find that fans often do  not distinguish between the actors and the characters they play, insulting them  or commiserating with them if they happen to encounter them in real life:  </P> <P> "Well, we live in a land of illusion. They make movies so real now, and in  movies, it's nothing to walk up and start shooting. So you have to consider. A  lot of people say violence doesn't cross over into people's everyday lives,  (but) things happen like this and you have to think twice about it. . . .  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Always Tragic'  </P> <P> "It's always tragic, but it's not surprising in today's world."  </P> <P> A radio performer pointed to "the city of L.A. itself -- you've got not only  people picking off high-profile people in general, but just driving down the  freeway, gang wars, people at fast-food restaurants getting bumped off. There's  a thin line anyway between fantasy and reality, and for people who live in a  nether kind of world, maybe that (a movie, an actor or actress admired or  reviled) spurred something."  </P> <P> Psychologist Dr. Stuart Fischoff, who has produced and written TV movies --  most recently "Miles to Go" with Jill Clayburgh -- sees Tuesday's swath of  violence as another piece of the pattern without a pattern: a society where  frustration creates violence and where that violence intrudes on every level of  life and life style, seeping even into the charmed circle of Hollywood as  surely as it does in South-Central Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Still, he said, "it's been pretty well documented by research that TV tends to  blur the real world; reality becomes less real. The intersection of these two  experiences is going to occur a lot more often" -- not necessarily with violent  consequences, but as a matter of perception.  </P> <P> "Especially," Fischoff added, "with people relying more and more on electronic  relations -- me and the TV, me and the fax machine, me and the computer," the  cocooning-retreat from complex social challenges to less demanding electronic  ones.  </P> <P> The fictions of television and movies provide a new kind of community, their  inhabitants are our neighbors, and thus their impact is almost personal, even  when the tragedies occur to people we do not meet.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unclear Lines  </P> <P> Fantasy tragedies can make us cry -- Dr. Jerry Clark, president of the media  division of the American Psychological Assn., recently sniffled his way through  the movie "Field of Dreams." That is the art of it. But when for certain  imbalanced fans the line between the actor and the person is not clear, danger  emerges.  </P> <P> The man who killed Schaeffer "probably had fantasized an intimate relationship  with her," Fischoff said. "What happens with TV is even the people who are too  psychologically weak to go outside and relate to people . . . can relate to  people in television, and then if it goes far enough you get the Hinckleys and  (Jacksons, Saldana's attacker) who probably feel very righteous in what they  did."  </P> <P> The intrusion of real life on Hollywood is of course not new, but it does seem  to many to be escalating. There have been movie-set accidents, where fantasy  disintegrates into tragic reality, from the earliest movies when the actress  crossing the ice floes in "Uncle Tom's Cabin" slipped into the freezing water,  to the deaths and injuries of stunt men and the death of three performers, Vic  Morrow and two children, in the "Twilight Zone" movie, which precipitated an  industrywide safety scare.  </P> <P> But the personalizing of violence to the performer is something else.  </P> <P> Just the recent instances: the man who showed up at Universal Studios to kill  actor Michael Landon, and allegedly killed two security guards; a man being  held in Illinois, who allegedly threatened singer Olivia Newton-John and  several others; a woman who just pleaded not guilty to sending more than 5,000  threatening letters to actor Michael J. Fox, and a woman who broke into  late-night host David Letterman's house and believes herself to be his wife.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Security Problems  </P> <P> Security consultant Gavin de Becker, who has advised Saldana, Fox and others,  and talked to legislators about special security problems for celebrities, sees  "a blurring of the line" of behavior toward actors "that we come to feel  intimately involved with, characters we really don't know but think we do."  </P> <P> "When you look at the American dream, this is the flip side. . . . When they  tell you you'll be free and you'll be famous and well to do, well compensated,  they don't also tell you you'll be at the center of a hurricane of desperate  people."  </P> <P> Jerry Clark, the psychologist, says it is "coincidental" that three deaths  should occur in one day, "but it's not coincidental that there's more violence  than ever before."  </P> <P> It points to the need to "reduce the amount of violence" on TV and in films.  </P> <P> "Who needs Lethal Weapon 2? I really do like the two actors but. . . . "  </P> <P> Times staff writer Elizabeth J. Mann contributed to this story.  </P> <P> * STUDIO SHOOTING  </P> <P> Police blamed shooting at Lorimar Studios on a soured business deal. Metro,  Page 1.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, 17 May KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  said Tuesday [17 may] it was "not very appropriate" for top  coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa to call the mass-circulation  daily ASAHI SHIMBUN "a red newspaper" which practices "black  journalism."    The premier was answering questions about the controversial  remarks by Ozawa, secretary general of the coalition's core  party Shinseito led by Hata.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai declined to answer a  similar question, saying the government cannot comment on  politicians' individual remarks.    Ozawa, speaking on Monday in Chiba, east of Tokyo, blasted  the daily for "slandering" him, apparently referring to a 26  April ASAHI SHIMBUN story in which he was quoted as saying that  "one is free to sleep with the woman of one's choice. It's none  of your business."    The comment was later criticized in the Diet and by some  public circles as being indiscreet and demeaning of women.    According to the ASAHI SHIMBUN, Ozawa made the remark when  asked about the ruling parties' formation of the parliamentary  group "Kaishin (Innovation)" the previous day.    The Social Democratic Party (SDP) seceded from the coalition  in late April after Kaishin was formed without the SDP being  consulted, reducing the Hata coalition to a minority government.</p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LACK OF FRUIT FLY EVIDENCE EASES CONCERN ON QUARANTINE  </P> <P> Ventura County agriculture officials this week reported no new findings of the  Oriental fruit fly, easing concerns about the possibility of a quarantine on  fruit.  </P> <P> The fly, found for the first time two weeks ago on Ventura County's west end,  sent alarm through the farming community because of its potentially devastating  effects on citrus, avocados, strawberries and other fleshy fruits.  </P> <P> But even with 920 traps set countywide, no new flies have been captured since  Oct. 27.  </P> <P> "We still have traps out, and they are checking them every day for a while  yet," said Ken Weiss, deputy agricultural commissioner. "But that's mostly a  precaution."  </P> <P> Weiss said the increased findings of the Mediterranean fruit fly in Los Angeles  County concerns growers in Ventura County.  </P> <P> "The more you get down in L.A., the more likely it is that they'll pop up up  here," Weiss said.  </P></p>

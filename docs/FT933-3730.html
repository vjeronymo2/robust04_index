			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Property: Land prices start the long climb back - Cadogan's Place BUILDING land prices are another sign of how the property market has touched bottom and is rising slowly. In 1988-89, many a village kitchen garden was sold off with outline planning permission for dwellings. Then, the market collapsed, falling more than 60 per cent between 1989 and mid-1992, according to Savills' residential building land price index. Now, this market is on the turn, gaining 1.8 per cent on average in the second half of 1992 and a further 7.4 per cent in the first half of this year. In the Cotswolds, Hurley Lloyd Thorpe reports quick sales of two sites, each with consent for four houses, at close to the asking prices of more than Pounds 150,000 (near Chipping Campden) and around Pounds 145,000 (near Stow-on-the-Wold). Until the middle of last year, the market fell relentlessly. Savills' Yolande Barnes says this made some site values 'too low when compared to a residual value (after building costs and developer's profit) based on house prices - even on the very depressed house prices of 1992.' Now, though, better land sales early in the year seem to have encouraged developers, including the local builder who bought the Chipping Campden site, to look around and plan ahead. In areas where there is not enough suitable land, developers are bidding up the prices, and a few prime sites have gone for 20 per cent more than last year. But Barnes does not expect any sustained increase until house prices move further ahead. * * * FARMLAND also is selling well, thanks to the improved EC support payments for UK farmers that appeared overnight as a result of the devaluation of the pound almost a year ago. Strutt &amp; Parker recently sold a farm of 188 acres in Northamptonshire, on the border with Leicestershire, for Pounds 385,000 at auction, quoting a guide price of Pounds 400,000 beforehand. The price works out at an impressive Pounds 2,073 an acre. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley sold Pounds 40m of farmland between May and August, noting that the funds to buy came 'almost exclusively from individuals and trustees.' They benefit most from legislation that allows 100 per cent relief from inheritance tax (IHT) for the owner's personal farming, which includes farming by contract and share farming . In the eyes of the Inland Revenue, it seems that being a farmer no longer involves getting up early. Even owning let land allows 50 per cent relief from IHT. * * * STONELEIGH, in Warwickshire, is an address that all farmers recognise as the home of the Royal Show each summer, and of the National Agricultural Centre. The Stoneleigh Abbey Preservation Trust and Kit Martin (well known for his conversions of major country houses) are seeking planning permission to convert the Georgian, Grade I-listed big house, plus its stables and the home farm, into flats. The state rooms will be kept for the public to see. To provide the funding, the trust has gone into partnership with Bryant Country Homes to build new houses on a site next to the home farm, a hotel near the Agricultural Centre, and two golf courses on arable land at places on the estate where they will not damage the look of the big house and its park, designed by Humphrey Repton. * * * NEW HOPE awaits the Brighton Marina as well. Housebuilder Barratt and the troubled leisure group Brent Walker have agreed that Barratt can market 30 existing houses and flats there. Barratt also is preparing plans for more units at parts of the site it has acquired from Brent Walker, and expects them to be available for buyers from early next year. Inquiries to 0273-693 636. * * * RENTING revived in the recession as a sensible alternative to what had, suddenly, become the perils of owning your own home. An imposing house now available (although possibly suited better for a company than an individual) is Dupplin Castle in Perthshire, built in 1969 by the architect Walter Schomberg Scott for the late Lord Forteviot of the Dewar's whisky family. It is astonishing that so prestigious a house - Scottish baronial, late 1960s' version - was built privately only 24 years ago. Like the 1940s' palaces of India's rajahs, it is gloriously unaware of changing worlds. Length of the lease and rent are both negotiable with Savills in Edinburgh (031-226 6961). * * * IN WARMER Devon, Craddock House near Uffculme and Tiverton is a Georgian property with a colonnaded veranda, a good garden and a Victorian conservatory with vines. The guide price from Jackson-Stops in Exeter (0392-214 222) is Pounds 750,000. A further 40 acres with farmhouse, barns and farm buildings are available for around Pounds 210,000. In Hertfordshire, Tuthill Manor is an intriguing, ancient, half-timbered house which has, over 30 years, been restored by its present owners into the glorious manor house, complete with great hall and gallery, it once was. John D. Wood (071-493 4106) offers it for Pounds 450,000.</p>

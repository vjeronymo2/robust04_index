			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / International Company News: Dickson Concepts surges 27% DICKSON Concepts, the Hong Kong-based fashion retailer and wholesaler, yesterday surprised stock market analysts with a 27 per cent increase in net profit to HKDollars 281.8m (USDollars 36.6m) for the year to March 1992. Turnover increased by 9 per cent to HKDollars 2.36bn. Earnings per share rose to 53.8 cents from 52.7 cents. Mr Dickson Poon, chairman, said the higher profits resulted from an across-the-board improvement in trading last year. He forecast significant growth and further development of Dickson Concepts in the coming year. A final dividend of 18 cents a share is to be paid, making a total for the year of 28 cents. Adjusted for the company's one-for-two rights issue last September, the total dividend payout was up 61 per cent, the company said. Dickson Concepts also announced a big push into China. It has reached agreements to distribute ST Dupont, Charles Jourdan and Guy Laroche labels on the mainland. More importantly, the company will develop a comprehensive range of men's and women's fashion products which will be manufactured and sold in the China market. 'This strategy will undoubtedly make the group a pioneer in the development of the brandname business in China,' the company said. Mr Poon said 1991-92 saw a substantial turnround of the company's fortunes in the UK and Taiwan. In October last year it bought Harvey Nichols, the London luxury department store, for Pounds 53.7m (USDollars 99.3m) from Burton Group. The company said the store was now operating profitably. Dickson Concepts has expanded the retail space available by 20,000 sq ft and opened another 20,000 sq ft for a specialty food store and two restaurants. It plans to install real-time information technology systems shortly, and to launch a collection of Harvey Nichols ladieswear in the UK and Hong Kong later this year.</p>

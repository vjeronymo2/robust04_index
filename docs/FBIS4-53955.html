			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- Commodity futures dealers  have been illegally discounting commissions for large investors  and foreigners, government sources said Monday [23 May].    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) and  the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries found in a  probe that dealers have discounted commissions for futures  transactions of gold, Azuki beans and other commodities for the  sake of specific investors in breach of the commodity exchange  law, government sources said.    Officially, however, the ministries deny any such misconduct  by the dealers, the sources said. The ministries will take no  particular punitive actions against the dealers.    Under the law, the practice of commission discounting is  banned and violators could face fines or other penalties,  although no cases of violation have ever been reported.    Japan's relatively high commissions -- seven to eight times  more for gold futures than on the New York market -- puts local  dealers at a disadvantage in international competition.  Therefore, it is widely seen as "common sense" among dealers to  change commissions from customer to customer in order to survive.    "We cannot compete unless we discount (commissions)," an  official with one firm said.    Responding to calls from Japanese traders, the government  plans to partially liberalize the commissions in June.    The planned liberalization, however, will be limited to  commissions for foreign investors and commodity funds apparently  because sweeping deregulation would hurt smaller dealers, the  sources said.</p>

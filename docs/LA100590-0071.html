			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ADVICE ON DUMP GAS IGNORED, OFFICIAL SAYS;  </P> <P> LOPEZ CANYON: AIR QUALITY ENGINEERS URGED DEEPER WELLS TO CONTROL METHANE  EMISSIONS FROM ROTTING GARBAGE AT THE LANDFILL.  </P> <P> A top Los Angeles sanitation official admitted Thursday that the city  disregarded the advice of regional air quality engineers when it installed an  inadequate collection system to control methane gas emissions at Lopez Canyon  Landfill in Lake View Terrace.  </P> <P> "The results were disappointing," Michael Miller, assistant director of the  city Bureau of Sanitation, told the South Coast Air Quality Management District  hearing board.  </P> <P> He said sanitation officials realize there may have been a flaw in the design  of the initial 18 wells the city installed by an AQMD-mandated deadline in  January of this year.  </P> <P> "We realized the failure," Miller said. "Certain elements were not operating  efficiently."  </P> <P> Since January, the city has installed more than 100 additional wells to collect  methane and other gases given off by garbage rotting underground at the  northeastern San Fernando Valley dump, Miller said. The sanitation bureau also  has plans to spend millions of dollars more on additional measures demanded by  AQMD officials to control the emissions, city officials said.  </P> <P> The AQMD hearing board, a quasi-judicial body, hopes to wind up testimony today  in hearings it has been holding since April on the emissions problem.  </P> <P> The hearings led to a new agreement aimed at satisfying all three sides in the  long-running dispute -- city sanitation bureau administrators, regional air  quality officials and dump neighbors made ill by the emissions -- that has been  submitted to the five-member board.  </P> <P> Board members agreed this week to conclude testimony on city efforts to control  gas emissions today, conduct a public hearing Oct. 18 in Lake View Terrace and  rule on the agreement Oct. 19.  </P> <P> "We'd like to wind this thing up," board member James Joyce said. "Some people  think these hearings have gone on far too long."  </P> <P> On Thursday, Miller said he believes the new agreement will bring the landfill  into compliance with state laws governing methane gas emissions because it is  more specific as to the steps the city must take.  </P> <P> He admitted that the initial wells installed at the dump were shallow -- 25 to  75 feet deep -- rather than deep wells of 100 feet or more recommended by AQMD  engineers. "Our engineers believed their system would work," Miller said. He  refused to answer a question as to which city official made the decision to  install shallow wells.  </P> <P> In other testimony, AQMD engineer Robert Pease said there was also a problem  with the initial system the city installed because the capacity of the flares  was not great enough to burn off all the gas collected by the wells.  </P> <P> An expanded flare system will be installed by the city, in addition to more and  deeper wells, Pease said.  </P> <P> AQMD engineer Jay Chen testified that he had advised the city to install deeper  wells because "the first 18 wells were inadequate to control gas emissions."  Other landfills, including Sunshine and Scholl Canyon, have followed the AQMD's  advice and have controlled emissions, Chen said.  </P> <P> "I don't particularly like the locations of the 18 wells" at Lopez, Chen told  the board. "They are too low."  </P> <P> He said the city also failed to submit all the monthly reports to the AQMD and  to monitor emissions at the dump as often as required by an Aug. 2, 1989, order  issued by the hearing board.  </P> <P> Board members said they were disappointed that the city had not installed an  easily accessible 24-hour telephone hot line to accept public complaints about  landfill odors, which was required in last year's order.  </P> <P> "One of the most infuriating and disgraceful things about all this is the way  that hot line was installed," board member William F. Banks said. The hot line  is connected at night to a sanitation facility near Los Angeles Harbor where  the employees are unfamiliar with Lopez Canyon, critics say.  </P> <P> "I'm concerned about having to hand out clothespins to the community," board  member Esther Lewin said about the odors.  </P> <P> Although city officials have maintained that the present gas-collection system  is operating more efficiently, an AQMD inspector was called to the site as  recently as Saturday morning because of the large number of complaints about  odors.  </P> <P> "The smell made some of us gag," said Rob Zapple, a Kagel Canyon resident who  has been a leader in fighting the dump.  </P></p>

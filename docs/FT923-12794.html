			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Spanish ban means Nike can't just do it: A trade mark ruling that prevents advertising and sales by the biggest sportswear group A SPANISH Supreme court decision to uphold a ban on the advertising and sale of sportswear in Spain by the US market leader Nike to protect a Spanish claimant to the Nike name is embarrassing Madrid just eight days before the Olympic Games start in Barcelona. For a time last week it was feared the courts might even use police to prevent the US athletic team, which is being sponsored by Nike, from entering the Montjuic stadium in Barcelona for the inaugural ceremony on July 25 if they were wearing the Nike flash. With Madrid under pressure from the US and the European Commission, the Barcelona judge who ordered the ban found a novel way around the problem - the athletes could wear their Nike uniforms as they would not have been bought in Spain. The ban has, of course, infuriated Nike, the world's biggest sportswear company with global sales last year of Dollars 3.4bn. Nike (slogan: 'Just do it') has been engaged in a three-year battle with the Spanish authorities to get its goods into the country and had been hoping to use the Games to launch a multi-million-dollar line of new sportswear. That respite aside, the ban, which is provisional and affects Nike apparel but not its shoes, has opened a serious breach in Spain's trade relations with the US. Madrid has been placed on Washington's watchdog list, making it a potential victim of reprisals. Government officials in the Spanish capital, asked in June by the European Commission for an explanation, confess they are concerned about the implications of the ban but that there is little they can do to overturn decisions made by independent judges. The government is trying to persuade the courts to allow Nike US to post a bond which would allow it to advertise during the Games but provide some security to the Spanish claimant to the Nike name should the courts continue to find against the US company. 'Over the past three years, in the Spanish courts and in the market place, our rights to operate as a brand in Spain have been trampled under,' said Mr Richard Donahue, president of Nike, from the company's Oregon headquarters recently. 'Our goods have been seized from bonded warehouses, our country manager harassed, read his rights and summoned before a criminal court to defend Nike's movement of products within the free trade zone (of European Community countries).' Nike's nightmare goes back to 1932 when a Catalan sock maker registered the Nike name in Spain. Little is known of the Spanish Nike's fortunes until 1982 when Nike Inc signed a distribution agreement with the owner of the rights to market the Nike brandname in Spain, a Catalan company called Cidesport. The actual trademark is owned by a Catalan lawyer, Mr Juan Amigo. When Nike International, Nike Inc's international operating arm, first began doing business with Cidesport, the marketing rights were held by two brothers, Carlos and Lorenzo Rosal Bertrand. Nike officials in Oregon say they were assured by the brothers that the local trademark was not a problem. However, by 1988 when Nike began to indicate it wanted to market its product directly in Spain, Mr Amigo had transferred the right of use of the name to Flora Bertrand, mother of the Bertrand brothers, and Cidesport would not let the trademark go. Mr Amigo and his partner are now offering to sell Nike the Spanish rights to the Nike name for Dollars 30m, which the US company flatly refuses to pay. But a Barcelona court has upheld the local company's rights to the mark and, in June, the Constitutional Court turned down an appeal by Nike International. At stake now is another appeal to overturn the ban while lawyers fight over the basic rights issue. Nike Inc reckons the ban could cost around Dollars 20m a year in Spain and that sales of Nike clothes by the Spanish company amount, in effect, to counterfeiting. That may allow the government, helpless to intervene until now, a way into the dispute by using its prosecutors to mount a criminal case but as yet no decision has been made. While the string of court cases is most unlikely to be resolved before the Games, Nike Inc can take heart, however, from the results of a 50-year battle by Perrier, the French natural water group, to sell its Vichy water in Spain. Then, too, Catalan courts repeatedly upheld the rights of the makers of Vichy Catalan to use the Vichy name in Spain. They relented last year. Nike Inc's struggle should not take quite so long; even this month it has been awarded new trade marks by the Spanish authorities. Mr Amigo's Dollars 30m play may be running out of time but until it does, Nike buffs may have to gambol about wearing only their shoes.</p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Flawed - but necessary A NEW booklet from the Occupational Pensions Board for pension fund trustees  -Pension Trust Principles - falls far short of being the practical guide needed if a repeat of the Maxwell affair is to be avoided. It tells trustees what they should and should not do, but not how to fulfil their role, particularly when the going gets tough. It does not give any practical advice on where trustees can seek help and make complaints other than to consult their legal advisers or go to court. In dealing with the relationships between employer and trustee, the booklet can only leave trustees more confused. To start with, it points out that the employer may be one of the beneficiaries of the scheme (Maxwell certainly thought he was). But then it states that while the trustees must consider the interests of all classes of beneficiary, it does not mean that trustees should consider the employer's interests when dealing with his obligations. This is certainly the case with self-investment in the form of loans to the company or buying and leasing back company occupied property. It warns trustees that they should not loan money to an employer simply to prop up an ailing business - easy advice to give but much more difficult for trustees to apply when it could well mean the company going under and leaving themselves and their colleagues out of a job. The booklet serves one useful purpose. It spotlights the complete inadequacy of operating pension schemes under trust law, especially when conditions are tough. Trustees cannot ignore this booklet, in spite of its shortcomings. The Commons Social Services Select Committee envisages the Occupational Pensions Board being overall watchdog with sweeping supervisory powers. But on this showing, the board would need to tighten up considerably before it could undertake this role. Pension Trust Principles Booklet, 191-195 Southampton Way, London SE5 7EF.</p>

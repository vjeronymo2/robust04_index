			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: TRESVANT COULD COME ON STRONGER;  </P> <P>  1/2 RALPH TRESVANT "RALPH TRESVANT"MCA  </P> <P> As the last member of New Edition to record a solo project, Tresvant -- always  the group's resident heartthrob -- must have felt a bellyfull of nerves when he  decided to do this album. The results are respectable if a bit formulaic and  unfocused, never really surpassing the monster he-man grooves of former  groupmate Bobby Brown's solo smashes, and too laid back to wallop the  misogyny-with-a-backbeat hits of Bell Biv DeVoe.  </P> <P> Tresvant's R&amp;B traditionalist style is most similar to that of New  Edition's Johnny Gill. Both of them are closer to the old-fashioned soul man  approach of a Jackie Wilson or Otis Redding than they are to the new jack swing  posture of their young contemporaries in black music.  </P> <P> While not as bold as Brown or adventurous as Bell Biv Devoe, Tresvant is not  without his strong points. On "Stone Cold Gentleman" and the Jimmy Jam and  Terry Lewis-produced "Sensitivity," he extends a near-irresistible invitation,  presenting himself as a dreamy-eyed antidote to the heavy-handed women bashers  of the world. Jam and Lewis produced one other radio-worthy track, "Rated R,"  and against its rap-laced incendiary beat, Tresvant comes on stronger still. If  only the rest of the album contained this much fire, freshness and new jack  nerve.  </P> <P>  Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to five (a classic).  </P> <P> CONNIE JOHNSON  </P></p>

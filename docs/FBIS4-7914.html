			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 4/4/1994 -- Possibilities are at  hand to expand the commercial exchanges and economic cooperation  between Romania and El Salvador, is the conclusion of the 4  April meeting between Romanian Trade Minister Cristian Ionescu  and Miguel A. Salaverria, minister of foreign affairs of El  Salvador.    The talks pointed to the necessity to diversify the Romanian  export offer to the Salvadorean market, to include more  products, such as farm machinery, equipment, installations. The  possibility was also emphasized to increase the presence in the  Romanian market of traditional El Salvador products, like  coffee, tropical fruit juices and concentrates, tropical wood.    The two parties agreed that a Romanian economic mission  should go to El Salvador at the end of April to seek out domains  of interest for cooperation between the two countries.    In 1993 the Romanian-Salvadorean trade was worth some $1.2  million.    Romanian exports to El Salvador consisted of chemical  fertilizers and tractors.    Romanian Senate President Oliviu Gherman also had a meeting  with the Salvadorean foreign minister Miguel Angel Salaverria  and stressed the compatibility between the two countries'  economies, saying that the visit by the Salvadorean chief  diplomat could allow for the singling out of zones where mutual  support in the process of democratization could be facilitated.    The Senate president expressed the Romanian Parliament's  readiness for the development of interparliamentary relations  between the two countries, possibly by setting up groups of  friendship.</p>

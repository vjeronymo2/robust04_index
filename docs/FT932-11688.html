			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A WELCOME, if possibly technical, bounce in stock index futures yesterday restored the June contract on the FT-SE Index to a premium against cash and encouraged a recovery across the range of the underlying equity market, reports Terry Byland. Local traders were active buyers of the contract but there were some large investment buyers. For most of the session, the Footsie contract traded at a premium of several points to cash, although not to the Fair Value which is currently worth around 7 points. At the official close, the contract was almost at Fair Value. Trading volume was well down, however, at just over 7,000 contracts. Strategists warned that yesterday's recovery was a technical response to the absence of the feared US sellers. The contract could be tested if it approaches the 2,828 area next week. Sharply lower trade in the FT-SE contract reduced overall activity in traded options to 26,640 from Thursday's 47,286. Lonrho headed the actives list with 2,573 contracts.</p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONDOS FOR 'AFFLUENT'  </P> <P> Regarding the article by David W. Myers "New Downtown Apartments Aimed at  Affluent" (June 25), foes of this complex have missed an important point of  having such apartments in the city: to begin to alleviate the horrendous  commutes and gridlocked freeways that Los Angeles has become famous for.  </P> <P> The reference to "affluent yuppies" is such a tired cliched, and pointless when  you consider that $1,500 per month is standard for anyone (not just yuppies) to  pay for rent in most of Los Angeles. Considering the cost of a mortgage these  days, it doesn't even seem "upscale," it seems average.  </P> <P> For people who need to work downtown or who like the urban life style, such  apartments and condos will be a welcome relief from life styles of the outlying  areas. Perhaps a greater variety of places to eat and shop will be drawn to the  downtown area and L.A.'s heart will become a fun place to live and work, equal  to towns like Boston and San Francisco.  </P> <P> In addition, whether we like it or not, L.A. will continue to attract record  numbers of new citizens from colder climes, and they're willing to commute  downtown from Palmdale, if that's what it takes to live here. Do we want them  on our freeways, or do we provide affordable housing for them that's closer  than an hour and a half on the freeway?  </P> <P> CAROL WORTHINGTON LEVY  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INFORMATION OVERLOAD;  </P> <P> WHAT TO DO WHEN ANXIETY CRIPPLES YOU  </P> <P> ONCE, PHONE service came from a single company, computers were used only by  rocket scientists and watching television meant choosing one of three major  networks. Today, the information assault is on. There are 125 long-distance  phone companies in California alone. Computers have revolutionized everything  from hand-held calculators to household appliances. And 1,388 TV stations crowd  the airwaves.  </P> <P> Want just the facts? If you went to the Library of Congress and looked at one  book, manuscript or other library resource each minute eight hours a day, five  days a week, it would take you more than 688 years to see all 85,895,835 items.  (That's up from 59,890,533 in 1969.) The size of the average American newspaper  has more than doubled since 1970 to 91 pages, and we spend 45 minutes a day  reading it -- though that is just 10 minutes more than a decade ago. The  average Sunday paper in 1970 had 145 pages; in 1986 it had 351.  </P> <P> Even convenience is increasingly complicated. One videocassette recorder --  with 35 buttons on its remote control -- takes salespeople about 45 minutes per  customer to explain. The instruction manual is 35 pages thick. Little wonder,  then, that a Circuit City salesman in Torrance says 20% of the 50 VCRs the  store sells every day are eventually returned by people who can't figure them  out.  </P> <P> Richard Saul Wurman, developer of the Access guides, including "L.A. Access,"  and creator of the "Smart" Yellow Pages, specializes in making information of  all kinds easy to find, use and digest. In this preview of his book,  "Information Anxiety," he describes symptoms of the malady of the Information  Age, and ways to keep from drowning in the data stream.  </P> <P> Illustrated by J. T. Steiny  </P> <P> THE DEFINITION  </P> <P> INFORMATION ANXIETY is produced by the ever-widening gap between what we  understand and what we think we should understand. Information anxiety is the  black hole between data and knowledge. It happens when information doesn't tell  us what we want or need to know.  </P> <P> Our relationship to information isn't the only source of information anxiety.  We are also made anxious by the fact that our access to information is often  controlled by other people. We are dependent on those who design information,  on the news editors and producers who decide what news we will receive, and by  decision makers in the public and private sector who can restrict the flow of  information. We are also made anxious by other people's expectations of what we  should know, be they company presidents, peers or even parents.  </P> <P> Almost everyone suffers from information anxiety to some degree. We read  without comprehending, see without perceiving, hear without listening. It can  be experienced as moments of frustration with a manual that refuses to divulge  the secret to operating a videocassette recorder or a map that bears no  relation to reality. It can happen at a cocktail party when someone mentions  the name Allan Bloom and the only person you know by that name is your dentist.  It can also be manifest as a chronic malaise, a pervasive fear that we are  about to be overwhelmed by the very material we need to master to function in  this world.  </P> <P> TELLTALE SIGNS  </P> <P> IF THE "In" basket in your office casts a shadow like Annapurna over your desk  and the mere mention of the word information makes you cringe and moan, chances  are that you're suffering from information anxiety. But if you're not sure, the  following behaviors are indications that dealing with information might be a  problem in your life.  </P> <P> Chronically talking about not keeping up with what's going on around you.  </P> <P> Feeling guilty about that ever-higher stack of periodicals waiting to be read.  </P> <P> Nodding your head knowingly when someone mentions a book, an artist or a news  story that you have never heard of before.  </P> <P> Finding that you are unable to explain something that you thought you  understood.  </P> <P> Blaming yourself for not being able to follow the instructions for putting a  bike together.  </P> <P> Refusing to buy a new appliance or piece of equipment because you are afraid  you won't be able to operate it.  </P> <P> Feeling depressed because you don't know what all of the buttons on your VCR  are for.  </P> <P> Buying high-tech electronics because you feel that, through osmosis, you'll  become more technologically knowledgeable.  </P> <P> Calling "The Society of Mind" "prophetic" even though you couldn't even  understand the book review of it, which is all you read.  </P> <P> Looking down at your digital watch to jot down the exact time in an office  building logbook even though you know that no one really cares.  </P> <P> Giving time and attention to news that has no cultural, economic or scientific  effect on your life.  </P> <P> Filling out a form and feeling compelled to fill in every blank.  </P> <P> Reacting emotionally to information that you don't really understand -- like  not knowing what the Dow Jones is but panicking when you hear that it has  dropped 500 points.  </P> <P> Thinking that the person next to you understands everything you don't.  </P> <P> Being too afraid or too embarrassed to say, "I don't know."  </P> <P> Or worse, calling something information that you don't understand.  </P> <P> We are bombarded with material from the media, from colleagues and from  cocktail party conversation, all of which is delivered in the form of what we  have been taught to think of as information. We are like a thirsty person who  has been condemned to use a thimble to drink from a fire hydrant. The sheer  volume of available information and the manner in which it is often delivered  render much of it useless.  </P> <P> THE DISEASES  </P> <P> THE FOLLOWING are misnomers, myths and diseases that litter the information  field. Unless you are aware of them, they will sabotage understanding. They  afflict our ability to see things we have always seen but have never really  seen. They obscure our path to learning. But by recognizing them, we can disarm  their potential to mislead us.  </P> <P> The disease of familiarity. Familiarity breeds confusion. Those afflicted are  the experts in the world who, so bogged down by their own knowledge, regularly  miss the key points as they try to explain what they know. You ask them the  time, and they tell you how to build a clock. We have all known teachers whom  we consider extraordinarily bright, yet we cannot understand what they are  saying. They fail to provide the doorknob or the threshold to each thought so  that you can grapple with the learning connections along the journey.  </P> <P> Looking good is being good. The disease of looking good is confusing aesthetics  with performance. A piece of information performs when it successfully  communicates an idea, not when it is delivered in a pleasing manner.  Information without communication is no information at all. It is an extremely  common, insidious malady among graphic designers and architects. The cure is to  ask how something performs.  </P> <P> The uh-huh syndrome. This occurs when our fear of looking stupid outweighs our  desire to understand. The manifestations are involuntary head-nodding and  repeating, "Uh-huh, uh-huh," pretending to know what we do not. Rather than  admit we don't understand quantum mechanics, we nod our heads as if we were  intimately familiar with the subject, desperately trying to give the impression  that we understand terms or allusions that are incomprehensible to us. This  only prevents us from learning and exacerbates our suspicion that everyone else  knows more than we do.  </P> <P> Unhealthy comparisons. Comparing unknowns or intangibles is uninformative; so  is comparing things that have nothing in common. People warn of the dangers of  comparing apples to oranges, when this is a perfectly reasonable comparison.  They share many common characteristics -- both are globular fruit that grow on  trees. An unhealthy comparison would be to compare the cost of a loaf of bread  or a movie 50 years ago to the cost today. The dollar had a completely  different value then. The informative value of this comparison is very little.  Whereas healthy comparison is one of the most powerful informative tools -- for  example, comparing the cost of a loaf of bread relative to a movie 50 years ago  and today.  </P> <P> If it's accurate, it's informative. One doesn't necessarily follow the other.  The cure is learning to go beyond the facts, to meaning, and to recognize the  nature of the receiver. Accuracy or facts do not necessarily make things  understandable. Quoting a price in pounds won't help someone who understands  only dollars and cents. Barometric pressure is another example. I would say  there is one person in a thousand who knows how the barometric pressure is  derived or what it means; yet weather commentators slavishly offer it in every  forecast.  </P> <P> Unnecessary exactitude. Rounding off is not a sin. Not only is extreme accuracy  not always information, it is often not necessary. For pilots, knowing the  exact altitude of the plane is important. But whether the plane is flying at  32,000 feet or 32,112 doesn't add to their experience of flying. In the  business community, an accountant needs exact figures, but someone making a  presentation on sales projections might just as well say that projected sales  will be $90,000 rather than $91,653. Just because the technology to provide  accuracy to the nth degree exists doesn't mean we have to take advantage of it.  Sometimes detail prohibits you from seeing the bigger picture. Even the federal  government permits rounding dollar amounts on tax forms.  </P> <P> Rainbow worship, or adjectivitis. This is an epidemic belief that more color  and more colorful language will increase understanding. This is particularly  insidious in sports reporting, which has adapted the dramatic language of war.  Teams are "annihilated, destroyed, massacred."  </P> <P> Here today, gone today memory dysfunction. This is characterized by total  memory loss one hour after learning something. This has been caused by the  educational system's emphasis on short-term memory. The cramming of unnecessary  information about unnecessary subjects for unnecessary examinations to get  unnecessary grades. The cure is very simple; the key to learning is remembering  what you are interested in and that through interest comes understanding.  </P> <P> Overload amnesia. This is a permutation of the here today, gone today memory  dysfunction that occurs more specifically as a response to overloading yourself  with data. When overtaxed, your memory will not only release the data that you  were trying to retain but also may arbitrarily purge other files as well. This  is often experienced when trying to assimilate data when you cannot control the  flow, such as in a classroom, conference or lecture. This is why, after  listening to a particularly ponderous speech, not only can you not remember a  thing the speaker said, but you forget where you parked your car, too.  </P> <P> User-friendly intimidation. User-friendly has to be one of the most absurd  terms in the language of technology. Like many other words in techno-talk, this  usually means the opposite of itself. Any piece of hardware or software that  has to be described as user-friendly is probably not. Often the appearance of  friendship with silly graphics is only camouflage for incoherent instructions.  Besides, why should a computer be friendly? We have the right to expect  technology and equipment to perform for us, to save us time and make our lives  easier, but if we expect friendship from it, we're bound to be disappointed.  </P> <P> Some-assembly-required gambit. I have no doubt that somewhere in the  instructions for building a Saturn missile are the words "some assembly  required." This is instant intimidation, a phrase lightly tossed off and  designed to make the user feel that any boob could put this machine together  during a network station break. I suspect that it's sheer business chicanery, a  trick so that the manufacturer can collect on a house call and a repair bill  after you have failed miserably at the some-assembly-required test.  </P> <P> The expert-opinion syndrome. There is a tendency to believe that the more  "expert opinions" we get -- be they legal, medical, automotive or otherwise --  the more informed we will be. But we tend to forget that "expert opinion" is by  no means synonymous with "objective opinion." Unfortunately, most experts come  with a professional bias that makes obtaining truly objective information  almost impossible. Take the second-opinion movement in medicine in which  patients are encouraged to consult more than one doctor before undergoing  non-emergency surgery. Surgeons are trained to respond to problems by  performing surgery, so it is likely that they will see surgery as the solution  to a patient's problem.  </P> <P> Don't tell me how it ends. The popularity of the suspense genre in books and  movies has encouraged people to extrapolate this to maintaining interest when  conveying new information as a salesman does when unveiling a new product. I  think not knowing how something ends makes us apprehensive; it prohibits us  from understanding how something was done while we frantically try to guess how  it might end. People love Shakespeare because they know the endings; an opera  is more pleasurable when you know the whole story before the curtain rises.  While suspense has its place, it does tend to induce anxiety, which is probably  not an optimum state for receiving new information. If you know the ending, you  can relax and enjoy the manner in which something is presented. An audience  will be more receptive to new information if it isn't kept in suspense, made  anxious trying to guess where someone is going. Many people can't really listen  to an idea until key questions about it have been answered in their minds.  </P> <P> Information impostors. This is nonsense that masquerades as information because  it is postured in the form of information. We automatically give a certain  weight to data based on the form in which it is delivered. Because we don't  take the time to question this, we assume we have received some information. My  favorite example of this is in cookbook recipes that call for you to "season to  taste" or "cook until done." This doesn't tell you very much. Why bother?  Information impostors are the fodder for administrativitis.  </P> <P> Administrativitis. This is a disease manifest in schools, institutions and big  business where the individuals think that they are running the system but where  the opposite is the case. It is characterized by a preoccupation with the  details of the operation -- administrative issues, salaries, square footage of  office space and supplies -- and a neglect of the purposes for operation. It  has reached global proportions and is the fundamental curse of our society.  </P> <P> Edifitis. This is a condition characterized by the belief that a better  building or a flashier annual report will solve all problems. Many a business  has crumbled trying to improve its corporate headquarters instead of its  corporation.  </P> <P> THE CURES  </P> <P> THESE ARE my own prescriptions for reducing anxiety, for making less painful  and more sensible decisions about the information in your life, for developing  practical defenses against the increasing onslaught of raw data. They include  the tactics I employ when the piles on my desk start to topple, my appointment  schedule short-circuits, and my life seems ever more complex. My battle plan  for conquering information and information anxiety is aimed at improving your  attitude toward the subject, as well as the actual approach you take to  information-processing.  </P> <P> Robust Attitudes  </P> <P> Accept that there is much you won't understand. Let what you don't know spark  your curiosity. Visualize the words I don't know as a bucket that can now be  filled with the water of knowledge.  </P> <P> As you learn about something, try to remember what it is like not to know. This  will add immeasurably to your ability to explain things to other people.  </P> <P> Reduce guilt feelings over the unread by recognizing that the quantity of  information is such that you can't read everything.  </P> <P> Every time you come across a new idea, try to relate it to something else. Find  a connection from the new idea to other ideas.  </P> <P> Think about opposites. When you have a problem, think of one solution, then of  its opposite. When you choose a direction, think about what would happen if you  went in an opposite direction.  </P> <P> Robust Actions  </P> <P> Become familiar with the traps and pitfalls of communicating information. Are  you a victim of:  </P> <P>  -- The disease of familiarity?  </P> <P>  -- Thinking that looking good is being good?  </P> <P>  -- The uh-huh syndrome?  </P> <P>  -- Unhealthy comparisons?  </P> <P>  -- Assuming that if something is accurate it's informative?  </P> <P>  -- Unnecessary exactitude?  </P> <P>  -- Rainbow worship, or adjectivitis?  </P> <P>  -- Here today, gone today memory dysfunction?  </P> <P>  -- User-friendly intimidation?  </P> <P>  -- Some-assembly-required gambit?  </P> <P>  -- The expert-opinion syndrome?  </P> <P>  -- Don't tell me how it ends syndrome?  </P> <P>  -- Failing to recognize information impostors?  </P> <P>  -- Administrativitis?  </P> <P>  -- Edifitis?  </P> <P> Establish your own level of appropriateness when it comes to accuracy. For  example, when someone asks you the time, instead of faithfully recounting to  the minute the time on your digital watch, try saying, "It's almost noon."  </P> <P> Make a list of the terms you use but don't really understand, such as the Dow  Jones Industrials or the M1, M2, M3, and make a point to learn what they mean  -- one at a time.  </P> <P> Plan your information diet as you would plan a vacation. Outline a system for  categorizing the information needs in your life based on your answers to the  following questions:  </P> <P>  -- What do you need for your job?  </P> <P>  -- How much is essential?  </P> <P>  -- How much is desirable?  </P> <P>  -- What subjects pique your interest?  </P> <P>  -- What do you like to talk about?  </P> <P>  -- What do you spend time with that isn't really necessary?  </P> <P>  -- How would the elimination of it change your life?  </P> <P> After you have established categories, develop a picture of your informational  habits (the newspapers you read, programs you watch, books you consult, etc.).  How do they fit into the larger categories and subgroupings?  </P> <P> Determine your preferred method of learning. Some people learn best by reading  a book, taking a course, experimenting or asking someone else. Then, when you  need to get information on a subject, try to find a way that will involve your  preferred form. Personally, I learn more from talking to one other person.  </P> <P> Isolate the informational areas in your life that give you the most anxiety.  They could be:  </P> <P>  -- Medical (talking to doctors).  </P> <P>  -- Financial (handling banking, mortgages, insurance forms, loan  applications).  </P> <P>  -- Electronic (buying equipment, operating technology).  </P> <P>  -- Reference materials (reading train schedules or statistical abstracts).  </P> <P> Just by making a list, you will probably feel less anxious. Rate the items from  one to 10. Postulate what would have to happen to reduce your anxiety in each  area. Would you have to take a course, study for two years, or could you call  someone on the phone? Then you might decide you would rather pay an accountant  to figure out your taxes than overcome your form phobia. Once you admit that  you can't know everything, you will be much more comfortable with the idea of  not knowing something.  </P> <P> Reduce your guilt pile of reading materials that seem to gaze disapprovingly at  you from their high perch on your desk while they wait interminably to be read.  I use the shard approach. First, I let the stack of periodicals (piled on the  floor next to my desk) reach a designated height (about 2 feet). Then I leaf  through them and rip out articles that interest me. This reduces my guilt pile  to a small stack of articles that becomes my interest "shards."  </P> <P> We have only begun to tap the markets for information. It is capital in an  unlimited supply. Information isn't just mathematical formulas or instructions  for a computer. It is art, advice, technology, theory and the motivation behind  all communications.  </P> <P> Those who profit most from it will be those who recognize its universality and  multiple applications. Those who tap into new sources of information with  confidence and a sound sense of purpose will be the power brokers of tomorrow.  </P> <P> As the economy adapts to an unlimited supply of capital, we will come to view  information in a different light and adjust our vision to accommodate it. And,  as we become more comfortable with living in an information age, we can shed  some of our anxieties about it.  </P></p>

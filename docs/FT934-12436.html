			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Companies back Bonn moves on competitiveness THE 16 leading industrial organisations in Germany, headed by the employers' federation, yesterday pledged their support for the government's campaign to revive German industrial competitiveness. In a joint declaration issued from the Petersberg guest house outside Bonn, they admitted that far too many German enterprises had failed to invest in cost control measures and new technologies, to prepare for the downturn in the German and world economies. 'We have the responsibility for introducing new products and using new production techniques,' they said. 'It is up to us to ensure and reinforce the position of research and development within our enterprises.' The declaration pledged the employers' support for measures to open new markets, especially in the Asia-Pacific area, and to improve the level of training of their workforces. At the same time they warned that cutting production costs meant reducing capacity to the level of market demand, and often job cuts were inevitable. As far as national wage-bargaining is concerned, they promised support for the maintenance of industry-wide contracts, while urging that they should be more flexible, and more in tune with the needs of individual enterprises. The industrial leaders held a meeting at the Petersberg with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and government ministers to seal their declaration, seen as an important gesture of reconciliation in a government-business relationship which has frequently been uneasy. For his part, Mr Kohl urged both sides of industry to concentrate on introducing more flexible working times and regulations, to expand the use of part-time working greatly, and to slow the trend towards early retirement. He warned that Germany's education system had become too extended and too academic, leaving the small business sector without the necessary recruits to maintain its traditional strength.</p>

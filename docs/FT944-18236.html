			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (22): Expanding, but it's a gamble - Korea: The ambitions of the country's Big Three South Korean car manufacturers are taking perhaps their biggest gamble since the industry was established in the 1960s by doubling their production capacity to at least 6m vehicles annually by 2000, with a third of this amount manufactured abroad. The rapid expansion is risky when the global car industry is already struggling with surplus production. But Korea's leading industries have traditionally been addicted to large-scale production to achieve economies of scale in spite of dire predictions about adverse market conditions. Korea's three leading carmakers - Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo - are hoping to repeat the success of the country's shipbuilding, electronics and petrochemical companies, which added massive production capacity during the last five years and are now reaping the benefits by quickly filling rising global demand. The expansion of car production has the support of the government, which selected the motor industry as a vital sector in 1990 and gave it easy access to state-subsidised bank loans and overseas borrowing privileges to raise capital for the capacity increase. If the expansion goes according to plan, Korea will become fourth biggest car manufacturer in the world by end of the decade, with its three main companies being included among the top ten carmakers. Hyundai wants to increase its production from 1.16m vehicles this year to 2.3m in the year 2000. Production will double to 1.5m at Kia by 1997 and quandruple to 2.2m at Daewoo by the end of the decade. Ssangyong, which produces commerical trucks and sports vehicles, also plans to start car manufacturing in late 1996 in cooperation with Mercedes-Benz. Its initial production of 50,000 cars is expected to rise to 150,000 by 2000. 'The Koreans are contradicting the global trend toward downsizing,' said Don Lee, motor industry analyst at BZW Securities in Seoul. 'They are justifying the expansion by going into new markets in the developing world.' Exports now account for only a quarter of Korean car production, but manufacturers want to raise the ratio to 40 or 50 per cent within the next several years as growth in the domestic market slows down to an annual rate of 10 per cent from 40 per cent in the late 1980s. The weakness of the Korean currency against the strong yen is likely to benefit Korea in its export plans. Overseas sales in developing countries accounted for 46.2 per cent of exports during the first half of 1994, while shipments to North America accounted for 37.4 per cent of exports and western Europe 16.4 per cent. The car companies are concentrating on increasing their market share in the developing world by building local assembly plants to avoid possible tariff barriers. Hyundai has signed joint-venture agreements in Indonesia, the Philippines, Egypt and Zimbabwe to produce a total of 300,000 cars abroad. Kia will also produce 300,000 cars overseas through planned facilities in Indonesia, Mexico, India and Morocco. Daewoo has set a more ambitious target of producing 1m cars in the developing world to take advantage of the region's low wages. Joint ventures have been established in Uzbekistan, Iran, India and Vietnam. Daewoo is now negotiating to build a car parts factory in China as the first step toward gaining approval from Beijing for the construction of a car factory in what is potentially its largest overseas market. But the Korean carmakers are not neglecting the US and Europe. While Hyundai already has a strong presence in these markets, its rivals are following suit. Kia began establishing distribution networks in the US and Europe last year and recently signed an agreement with Karmann of Germany to produce its Sportage four-wheel drive vehicle for the European market from next year. Daewoo has acquired a car plant in Romania to supply vehicles for its independent West European dealer network, which will begin operations in 1995. It will also enter the US market in 1996. But while Korean carmakers are aggressively expanding abroad, they must worry about the opening of their strongly protected home market to imports. The US and the EU are demanding that Korea reduce duties and non-tariff barriers that limited the sale of foreign cars in Korea to slightly less than 2,000 last year, only 0.19 of the total market. Seoul recently agreed to cut the car tariff to 8 per cent from 10 per cent and ease restrictions on TV advertising and distribution outlets, but the concessions have still not satisfied Washington, which has led the campaign against the car import restrictions. Even if further concessions are made, sales of US and European cars in Korea are not likely to represent much of a threat to domestic manufacturers since the foreign models will be concentrated in the executive car segment. A more serious worry would be abolition of the two decade-old ban on car imports from Japan. It remains undecided whether the Korea will lift the ban in 1997 as part of a programme to improve trade relations with Japan. But Tokyo is expected to demand this action if Korea wants to gain membership in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 1996. The irony is that the Korean motor industry has largely developed due to technical help provided by Japanese car manufacturers. Hyundai has a partnership with Mitsubishi, Kia with Mazda and Ford, and Daewoo recently linked up with Honda after dissolving its joint venture with General Motors.</p>

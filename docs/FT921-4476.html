			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Bush sure of his prize in 'home state' of Texas PRESIDENT George Bush has not even bothered to campaign in his adopted home state of Texas in the past 10 days, so sure he is of a convincing win. The campaign of the right-wing Republican challenger, Mr Patrick Buchanan, who originally made Texas a target state, says that '25-30 per cent would be a major victory'. This would be less, for example, than the uncommitted vote in South Dakota, when Mr Bush ran unopposed. Among the Democrats, Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton's campaign has been up and running in Texas since December, and is far better organised than that of his chief rival, former Massachusetts senator Paul Tsongas. Mr Clinton's populist style goes down well in Texas, and he has portrayed Mr Tsongas as an out-of-touch north-easterner, the 'Wall Street' candidate. President Bush, says Mr Arnie Vedlitz, a political scientist at the Texas A&amp;M University, will probably suffer less in Texas from the protest vote that has hurt his campaign in the rest of the country. The president, whose legal residence is in Houston, Texas, has close ties with the local Republican party, and, notes Mr Vedtz, 'conservative Republicans do not feel alienated here, because they have not been shut out of the system'. Mr Buchanan's resort to racist themes has not gone down well in a state where around 40 per cent of the population are black or Hispanic, and where immigration has long been accepted by both Democratic and Republican parties. Republicans in Texas are, for example, opposed to making English the official language, and like most Texans, are enthusiastic supporters of the proposed Mexico-US free trade pact - which Mr Buchanan has railed against. However, conservative Texans are still smarting from the president's U-turn on taxes, and the poor state of the economy. But here again, Mr Bush is likely to fare a little better than in the rest of the country. Texas's recession started much earlier than in the rest of the US, and recovery of sorts is on the way. The stakes for Mr Clinton in Texas are high, since he is overwhelming favoured to win. In the latest opinion poll, Mr Clinton scored 41 per cent against 18 per cent for Mr Tsongas. As Walter Dean Burnham, a political scientist at the University of Austin says: 'If he fails in Texas that will be the end of him.' Mr Clinton, from neighbouring Arkansas state, is by far the richest Democratic candidate, with his campaign team saying it hopes to have raised Dollars 1m in the state (when final figures are out). Mr Tsongas has found it very difficult to raise his visibility in a state where two months ago he was unknown and where it is expensive to make any impact in the highly diverse media market. Mr Clinton's position to the left of Mr Tsongas will help in a state where Democratic primary voters are now mainly minorities, union supporters, or traditional liberals. Mr Clinton has been backed by the 95,000-strong Texas state teachers association, the governing body of the state Democratic party, Mexican-American organisations, the state land commissioner and several prominent unions. It was the ability to attract these sorts of endorsements that helped Mr Michael Dukakis sweep the Texas primary four years ago. The character issue may haunt Mr Clinton down the road - if he gets that far  -but for Texas Democrat primary voters it has made little impact, with no significant drop in Mr Clinton's support between January and February. Texan Democrats are generally tolerant of personal vices. Mr Tsongas is thus playing an expectations game, with a campaign spokesman saying the candidate is hoping for a strong second place, aided by likely support from well-off suburban voters in the Austin area. He opened up his office in Austin only two weeks ago, and the first night had to work by candlelight, thanks to a lack of electricity. 'We don't have the organisation of the leading candidate' admits a spokesman, 'but we are relying on personal character and the message'.</p>

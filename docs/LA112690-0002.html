			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: ATTENTION, HUSBANDS: MATRIMONIAL ADVICE FROM A 39-YEAR  VETERAN  </P> <P> Gloria Steinem and Molly Yard may want to leave the room.  </P> <P> Evan Keliher, a new resident of Rancho Bernardo, has just written "For Men  Only: How to Survive Marriage."  </P> <P> Probably at bookstores by January or February, published by CCC Productions in  Los Angeles (known for the classic "Hormones From Hell").  </P> <P> Keliher, 59, a retired school administrator, wants to give men a fighting  chance to maintain their sanity and self-respect. Here are his rules from  Chapter 3: "Early Danger Signs."  </P> <P> * Women are basically all alike; the apparent differences are illusory.  </P> <P> * Suspect her motives from the first date and look for signs of deception.  </P> <P> * Beware of so-called romantic marriages; it's more important to know her  credit rating and work history.  </P> <P> He recommends bachelorhood and prenuptial agreements ("chock-full of  obfuscating flyspecks and legalese"). Here's his section on in-laws:  </P> <P> "Get half-loaded on the old man's best Scotch on every visit. Turn on the  football game and don't take your eyes off the screen all afternoon. Insist on  eating from a TV table so you won't miss any of the game."  </P> <P> So why did Keliher, married these past 39 years, write "For Men . . ."?  </P> <P> "Partly for humanitarian reasons," he explains. "Married men need all the help  they can get. Also, I want fame and fortune. I want to drive a Porsche."  </P> <P> His chapter on wifely nagging traces nagging back to the late Cretaceous period  and notes that one of the all-time nags was Socrates' spouse, Xanthippe.  Hemlock was a pleasure by comparison.  </P> <P> Keliher presumes -- hopes, actually -- that his book will be controversial. If  so, he's been there before.  </P> <P> When he was working at an inner-city school in Detroit, he published the  satiric "New Africa High: A Low Comedy."  </P> <P> He sold 20,000 copies and adapted the story for a low-budget film called "Rebel  High." He also received numerous death threats.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Our Sewers Are Your Sewers  </P> <P> Seen and heard.  </P> <P> * Your government at work.  </P> <P> The San Diego City Council today will honor the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  for including anti-drug messages in their lip-synced songs.  </P> <P> The turtles, who start a five-day run at the Sports Arena on Wednesday, will  receive a gold-colored key to the San Diego sewer system.  </P> <P> * Jeannette Roache, wife of sheriff-elect Jim Roache, has resigned as vice  president and political operative for the Building Industry Assn.  </P> <P> It's all part of a shake-up due to the uniting of the political efforts of the  BIA, Construction Industry Federation and Assn. of General Contractors.  </P> <P> The new effort will be headed by Frank Panarisi, former assistant chief  administrative officer for the county government.  </P> <P> * San Diego Catholic News Notes, the new newsletter for conservative Catholics,  is the handiwork of Jim Holman, anti-abortion activist and editor-owner of The  Reader.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Santa for the Dogs  </P> <P> News from the north.  </P> <P> * Ho, ho, herpetology.  </P> <P> Anyone interested in having his pet pose with Santa Claus is invited to the  Village Fair Shopping Center in Carlsbad from Dec. 1-9.  </P> <P> For $5, you get a color Polaroid. An announcement says it's a fund-raiser for  the North County Humane Society and SPCA, Oceanside.  </P> <P> All pets are welcome. To prove it, the organizers included a picture of Santa  with a 10-foot Burmese python wrapped around his neck.  </P> <P> * North County bumper sticker: "Life Is Good. Deal With It."  </P> <P> * Someone stole a Bible from the purse of a 68-year-old Cardiff woman sitting  on a bench in Del Mar. Go figure.  </P> <P> * Headline in the Fallbrook Enterprise: "Do You Still Call It An RV When Its  Owners Spend Their Time Volunteering for Hard Work Instead of Enjoying  Recreation?"  </P> <P> From the country-Western song of the same title, presumably.  </P></p>

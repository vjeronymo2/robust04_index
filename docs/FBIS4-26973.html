			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Yan Jinjiu (7051 6855 0036) and Su Ruozhou </F> (5685 5387 5297): "Inherit and Develop Our Army's Night  Fighting Tactics"]    [Text] Jinan, 19 Jun (JIEFANGJUN BAO) -- The nine-day  all-Army on-the-spot meeting on the reform of night training  came to a satisfactory conclusion yesterday. Liu Huaqing, vice  chairman of the Central Military Commission, personally arrived  at the field to instruct and observe an exercise, and make an  important speech. During the session, Vice Chairman Zhang Zhen  made a special trip to visit the All-Army Exhibition of  Renovated Equipment for Night Fighting Training, whereas General  Chief of Staff Zhang Wannian presided over the meeting.    The on-the-spot meeting focused on the theme of resolving  how  should night combat and training be conducted under hi-tech  conditions -- through lectures on night combat theory;  exchanging experiences; demonstration maneuvers between two  units, with results scored in tactics, ways of training,  contents, and logistics -- while playing a role in guidance,  promotion, and standardization for the whole Army to unfold  in-depth reform of night exercises. The leading and related  departments of various military regions and service arms in  charge of training, and comrades of some command institutes and  academies universally reflected that the recent on-the-spot  demonstration and seminar were characterized by inheritance, as  well as blazing new trails, and were very valuable at that,  while opening wide the train of thought for developing the  tradition of night fighting and promoting reform in night  training.    Various troops throughout the Army have deepened training  reform over the past two years, based on the general design and  arrangements made by the Central Military Commission and General  Staff Headquarters. Focusing on the knotty issues in night  fighting this year, the Army, Navy and Air Force have worked  together to tackle the bottlenecks through concerted efforts.  They figured out measures characterized by developing the  strong points and avoiding weaknesses in order to find  countermeasures that aim to avoid the opponent's strong points  and attack its weaknesses. They worked hard at contention in  intelligence and courage, determined moves giving play to the  Army's might in integrity, and reformed technological equipment  while creating new tactics. As a result, a whole range of night  fighting tactics and ways of night training having  characteristics of the times, as well as of our Army, gradually  have taken shape, which brought along the comprehensive study in  combat and training issues under hi-tech conditions, and  promoted in-depth development throughout the reform of training.  The recent on-the-spot demonstration placed the main results of  night training reform, which reflected the joint efforts and  pooled wisdom of the officers and men of the whole Army, under  the test of a live exercise in fighting tactics. For the first  time in our Army's history of training, live exercises in night  fighting tactics on the scale of a reinforced infantry division,  as well as of a reinforced tank regiment, were conducted. For  the first time, a live ground exercise in fighting tactics was  conducted with the air arm, airborne troops, and Air Force units  under ground force command working in coordination. This has  augmented faith in night combat, while finding solutions to both  the ways and means.    During the meeting, Military Commission Vice Chairmen Liu  Huaqing and Zhang Zhen, Chief of General Staff Zhang Wannian,  Deputy Chiefs of Staff Li Jing, and Cao Gangchuan; Xu Caihou,  deputy director of the General Political Department; Zhao Nanqi,  commandant of the Academy of Military Sciences; Zhu Dunfa,  commandant of PLA National Defense University; Wu Quanxu,  assistant to the chief of general staff; Zhou Liangyou, deputy  director of the General Logistics Department; and comrades  participating in the all-Army on-the-spot demonstration of  reform in night fighting and night training; visited the  exhibition of all-Army night vision equipment, and renovated  equipment for night fighting and night training. On display at  this exhibition were renovated night fighting reconnaissance,  camouflage, command, and countermeasure equipment with which our  Army already has been equipped. They all were researched and  manufactured with the Army's own efforts. All this showed that  the level of our Army's night combat equipment has greatly  improved, and the means of night vision and night combat have  been markedly elevated.    In his important speech at the meeting, Vice Chairman Liu  stressed that all PLA troops must deepen research on issues  concerning combat under hi-tech conditions. He said: Issues of  combat under hi-tech conditions are an entirely new topic. What  we were familiar with in the past was entirely incompatible with  the demands of future combat. It is imperative to strengthen  research on this issue, and to think of ways and countermeasures  to develop our military thinking, strategies and tactics. Focal  efforts should be exerted on studying and researching hi-tech  warfare. Regarding hi-tech warfare, general knowledge about it  is not enough, nor is general research; genuine efforts and hard  work are called for. Whether in studying high-tech knowledge or  research in hi-tech warfare, our leading comrades at all levels  -- especially chief military officers and political commissars  or instructors -- must do a good job in playing an exemplary  role, take the lead in study, earnestly think how they should  plan for the development of army building and improvement of  army combat effectiveness. Efforts must be made to inherit and  develop our Army's traditional tactics. The strategies and  tactics of the people's war were a magic wand for our Army to  win victory over the enemy; we will always inherit its basic  concepts.    However, regarding specific fighting tactics, we  must proceed from the characteristics of combat under hi-tech  conditions, while continuously developing them and blazing new  trails. It is necessary to grasp those key and difficult points  that have a bearing on the overall situation, and to tackle  those bottlenecks with focused efforts, resolving them one after  another. All sides, departments, and levels should work with  concerted efforts, pool their wisdom, and grasp implementation  to seek development. Vice Chairman Liu required officers and  men of the whole Army to do a good job in bringing forward the  tradition of the Red Army and of army building in accordance  with the general requirement of Chairman Jiang's "five-point  instruction," to provide staunch and powerful security insurance  for reform, opening up, and modernization, and to live up to the  trust of the party and people.    At the meeting, Chief of General Staff Zhang expounded on  how  to deepen reform in night training. He indicated that to  continue to deepen reform in night training, it is imperative to  grasp firmly the core issue of developing and creating new night  combat tactics. To achieve this, it is necessary to do a good  job of grasping five important links: First, we should proceed  from the new fighting tactics of our opponent in creating our  own. Second, we should proceed from giving play to the effects  of existing weapons and equipment to create new fighting  tactics. Third, it is necessary to proceed from the  characteristics of future battlefields in creating new fighting  tactics. Fourth, we should proceed from resolving the difficult  point of hi-tech warfare creating new fighting tactics. Fifth,  it is necessary to proceed from developing our Army's flexible  strategies and tactics to create new fighting tactics. These  five links are the chief channels in the reform of fighting  tactics, as well as the important signs for testing fighting  tactics. They reflect the organic combination of the subjective  and the objective, common nature and individuality, and  inheritance and development; they are interrelated with mutual  infiltration. Only by analyzing and studying them in synthesis  will it be possible to create new fighting tactics.</p>

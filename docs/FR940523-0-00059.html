			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> F. NRC or Agreement State Concurrence <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Several commenters objected to the provision in &sect;765.21(d) of the proposed rule requiring NRC or Agreement State concurrence in the reimbursement claim approval process. These commenters asserted that involving the NRC or Agreement States in the process will cause undue delay. Furthermore, commenters argued that the Department's review will be adequate because of the Department's experience with UMTRCA Title I sites and because approved reclamation plans, or other written authorization for both pre- and post-UMTRCA costs, will be submitted to support claims for reimbursement. Some commenters argued that NRC or Agreement State concurrence is unnecessary for those claims that fall clearly within the scope of an approved plan or license condition. However, another commenter strongly supported the requirement for written certification from NRC or an Agreement State that claims be substantially in conformance with NRC or Agreement State authorization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed elsewhere in this preamble, section 1004(3) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a&hyph;3(3)) requires that remedial action costs for which reimbursement is claimed must be for work ``necessary to comply with all applicable requirements'' of UMTRCA or, where appropriate, with applicable requirements established by an Agreement State. Whether work is necessary to comply with UMTRCA or Agreement State requirements often may be determined, at least in part, by a review of a site's approved reclamation plan or other written authorization. Licensees are required to link each cost of remedial action for which reimbursement is claimed to a specific element or activity contained in an approved reclamation plan or other NRC or Agreement State authorization for both pre- and post-UMTRCA costs. This will facilitate the Department's review of claims, and help to ensure that reimbursement is made only for costs incurred for activities necessary to comply with UMTRCA or, where appropriate, with applicable Agreement State requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There may be situations, nevertheless, where the Department's review of the site's reclamation plan or other written authorization does not confirm that an activity for which reimbursement is claimed was necessary to comply with UMTRCA or, where appropriate, Agreement State requirements. To address these situations, &sect;765.21(d) of the proposed rule provided that before approving a claim for reimbursement, the Department would request NRC or the Agreement State to review the claim and provide written concurrence that the activities for which reimbursement is claimed are ``substantially in conformance with the licensee's approved reclamation plan.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the concerns raised by commenters, however, the Department has revised the requirement for NRC or Agreement State written concurrence. When it is not clear from a comparison of a claim and the approved site reclamation plan or other written authorization that an activity for which reimbursement is sought was necessary to comply with UMTRCA or, where appropriate, with applicable Agreement State requirements, the Department will consult with the appropriate regulatory authority to determine whether the activity was necessary to comply with these requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, some commenters urged that &sect;765.21(c) of the rule explicitly provide licensees with a right to attend and participate in informal conferences between Department and NRC or Agreement State personnel concerning a claim for reimbursement. The Department has decided not to adopt this approach. The claim submittal and review process provide a licensee with ample opportunity to present any relevant information or clarification necessary for the Department to be fully informed in reviewing and acting upon a claim. In addition, the Department may, at its discretion, provide a licensee with additional opportunities to clarify any issues which could arise with regard to a claim prior to reaching a final decision. However, to conform with the above revision to &sect;765.21(d) the Department has deleted the reference to the informal conference with NRC or an Agreement State in &sect;765.20(c). Any informal conference would be conducted as part of the Department's consultation with these regulatory agencies pursuant to 765.21(d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> G. Reimbursement of Costs of Subsequent Remedial Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Section 765.30 of the proposed rule required licensees seeking reimbursement of costs after December 31, 2002 to submit a subsequent plan for remedial action to the Department in accordance with section 1001(b)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act. Specifically, reimbursement of costs incurred after December 31, 2002 would be subject to Department's approval of a plan containing: (1) Applicable remedial action requirements established by NRC or an Agreement State pursuant to UMTRCA that had not yet been satisfied by the licensee; and (2) the total cost of remedial action required at the site, with supporting documentation, segregated into actual costs incurred and anticipated future costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters indicated that the proposed rule provided inadequate guidance on the criteria the Department will use in approving a subsequent plan for remedial action. Specifically, these commenters construed proposed &sect;765.30(c) to mean that the Department would, if necessary, require a licensee to make changes to a reclamation plan approved by NRC or an Agreement State. In addition, some of these commenters claimed that the Department's review should be limited to matters of schedule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

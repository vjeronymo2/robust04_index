			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Paraguay keeps links with past MR Juan Carlos Wasmosy became Paraguay's first-ever democratically elected civilian president on Sunday, when outgoing President Andres Rodrguez surrendered power as scheduled four years after toppling Gen Alfredo Stroessner in a bloody coup. But Mr Wasmosy, a politically inexperienced construction millionaire, promised no sudden break with the country's past, overshadowed for 35 years by Gen Stroessner. In his inauguration speech Mr Wasmosy called for 'dialogue, tolerance and unity' and promised to continue the previous government's policies of political and economic liberalisation. Mr Wasmosy, 54, named a 10-member cabinet of politicians and bureaucrats who served first under Gen Stroessner and then under Mr Rodrguez. During his four-year term as president, Mr Rodrguez is credited with bringing unheard of democratic freedoms to Paraguay while reforming its closed and backward economy. Mr Wasmosy's narrow election victory in May, when he won 40 per cent of the votes, ensures that the dominant Colorado party maintains its 60-year grip on power, but it no longer holds exclusive control over government. Two opposition parties now dominate Congress, forcing Mr Wasmosy to begin negotiations with political leaders on a 'governability pact'. At the same time, the new president needs to preserve good relations with the armed forces, which retain great political influence in Paraguay. He is not expected to investigate aggressively corruption scandals involving top army officers that came to light during the final year of Gen Rodrguez's government.</p>

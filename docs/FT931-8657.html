			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Technology: Sights set on wider horizons - Wearers of spectacles and contact lenses want to look good as well as see better One day, the chances are that if you are not a myope or a hyperope, you will become a presbyope. You may have done so already. There is nothing to worry about; the terms do not denote weird changes of appearance or behaviour. They define the main types of eyesight problem which require people to wear spectacles or contact lenses, either from childhood or, somewhat disconcertingly for those born with perfect vision, from the onset of their 40s. Almost everybody needs lenses at some stage of their life - spectacles have a bigger slice of the market than contacts - and companies are striving to bring out new products that combine improved optical quality with greater elegance. These include new thinner and lighter plastics, special coatings and tints, and the blending of varying optical strengths on the same lens to eliminate the bifocal effect. Essilor, the French company which leads the world spectacle lens market, reckons that (excluding the statistically opaque eastern European region and China) one in five people wears a corrective lens. This means 700m pairs of lens-covered eyes. In the western industrialised countries, the proportion is much higher: some 60 per cent of people in North America have lenses, as do 40 per cent in western Europe, and 41 per cent in Japan. Half the lenses are sold to presbyopes - the greying over-40s who find that a hardening of the eye's crystalline lens makes it harder to focus sharply. With a higher proportion of older people in the populations of developed countries as the post-war 'baby boom' generation ages, the demand for lenses to correct presbyopia will obviously rise sharply. More than 90 per cent of those aged 45 and over in the US wear lenses, and over 70 per cent in other industrialised countries. 'The presbyopic is the fastest growing market,' says Jacky Fremont, head of Essilor's UK operation. The other common types of lens wearer for which companies cater are myopes, who can see well at short distances but poorly from afar, and hyperopes, with the opposite problem. In western Europe, there are nearly 60m myopes (including 5m in the UK alone) and more than 35m hyperopes (4m in the UK). Whatever their vision problem and however serious it may be, most people do not just want to see better through their lenses. They also want to look better while wearing them. Much of the fashion effort goes into producing more elegant, colourful and stylish frames. But the appearance of the lens is also important, especially for those whose sight is bad enough to warrant a thick prescription lens. By far the biggest share of the spectacle lens market is accounted for by plastic, which is much lighter than glass. The original CR39 polymer resin, developed in the US and first used by Essilor in the 1950s, is about half the weight of glass. It is shockproof and accepts artificial tints better than glass. But it is also about 30 per cent thicker than glass and less scratch-resistant. Much of the optical companies' recent work, therefore, has been on thinner and lighter lenses from more advanced resins. This development began in Japan, where there is a high level of myopia and thus a greater degree of sensitivity to the wearing of very thick lenses. The California-based Sola Group expects the thin, light end of the market to grow at about 20 per cent annually in the next few years. Its new Spectralite lenses are made of tough, versatile plastic material and have aspheric designs which make them flatter than spherical lenses. These compete with Essilor's Ormex lenses, which are up to 55 per cent lighter than glass and 30 per cent lighter than its Orma material introduced in the 1960s. Both companies' products use material with a high refraction index which requires less curvature. Essilor and Sola (owned by Pilkington of the UK which has put it up for sale) are the main players in the world spectacles market, but there are a host of smaller competitors such as Rodenstock and Zeiss in Germany, Hoya, Seiko and Nikon in Japan, and American Optical, Signet Armorlite and Vision Ease in the US. 'The market is highly competitive,' says John Heine, Sola's chief executive. In the expanding presbyope market, so-called progressive lenses have gained in popularity as they do away with the segment lines on bifocal or trifocal lenses and the need to switch between glasses for reading and other uses. With a progressive lens, the wearer - there are 130m presbyopes in Europe - can move through a family of lenses whose outer curve changes gradually as eyesight worsens. Essilor's Varilux Multi Design, in plastic or glass, has 12 lenses, while Sola has its rival Graduate and XL products; as with all corrective lenses, it is the carving out of the inner curve which gives the lens its individual character. 'It's quite a complex operation to shape the surface and get the power without a segment line showing,' says Colin Perrott, Sola's head of technology. 'In future, there will be a multiple choice of different lens designs according to people's lifestyles and different materials according to taste.' Apart from frame and lens shapes and the materials used, spectacle wearers can also satisfy their varying tastes by having coatings applied. These are used to make plastic lenses scratch resistant, eliminate reflection, repel water, and either tint lenses or enable them to darken in sunlight. At Essilor's UK plant near Bristol, the quartz anti-reflection coating is put on in a special vacuum chamber using sophisticated computer-controlled machines. The coating works by turning the light reflection back on itself. Fremont says Essilor's anti-reflection coating increases sight transmission from 92.5 to 99.6 per cent. Most coatings absorb damaging ultra-violet rays. For work on screens - now covered in the EC by a special directive - companies have developed tints that soothe the eyes. Essilor, in partnership with PPG Industries of the US, has also come up with a way of giving plastic lenses something approaching the photochromic quality of glass, enabling them to darken fashionably in sunlight. Vanity may not rule the world of optics, but it has a strong influence.</p>

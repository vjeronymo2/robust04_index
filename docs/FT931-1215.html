			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / International Bonds: AT&amp;T returns with Dollars 400m issue AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications giant, returned to the international bond market for the first time since 1987 to refinance part of the Dollars 1.5bn of bonds it decided recently to repay early. The Dollars 400m, five-year issue was said to have been aggressively priced, given that the company's credit ratings are under review for a possible downgrade from both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's. The bonds were priced to yield 40 basis points over US government bonds. But AT&amp;T's strong name recognition among retail investors and the relative lack of new five-year Eurodollar bonds recently ensured success. A number of banks involved in the transaction reported the bonds had sold well, and they were freed to trade early in the day. Other retail-driven deals met a mixed response yesterday. After a recent five-year Canadian dollar issue from the Kingdom of Denmark, the Mortgage Bank of Denmark launched CDollars 150m of five-year bonds which carry a guarantee from the Kingdom. They were launched at a yield spread of 60 basis points over the Canadian government benchmark, which was said to be too close to where the Kingdom's own issue was trading at the time to assure the new bonds of strong demand. Also, much of the Canadian dollar paper issued recently to take advantage of attractive five-year swap rates is still said to be with underwriters, leaving little demand for more bonds in the same maturity. The bonds were bid later in the day at 99.20, down from the 99.45 at which they were offered, despite a rise in the Canadian government bond market. A better reception greeted the latest bond issue from a Latin American borrower, a Dollars 150m offer from the public-sector Bancomext (Banco de Comercio Exterior). At seven years, the issue extends the maturity further than recent Mexican issues. The yield spread of 220 basis points over US Treasuries, compared with the 208 basis point spread on the recent five-year United Mexican States issue from Deutsche Bank, was said to be fairly priced by banks not involved in the transaction. The steady flow of Mexican paper in recent weeks contrasts with the flood of Brazilian bonds in the past fortnight. Banco do Brasil added to this on Wednesday with a Dollars 100m, five-year deal through CSFB at a yield spread of 540 basis points. Although from a highly-regarded borrower, the bonds presented a severe test for the market.</p>

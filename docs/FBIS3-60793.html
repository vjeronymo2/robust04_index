The ring planned to  assassinate high-ranking Lebanese officials to destabilize the  country and embarrass Syria ahead of the Syrian-U.S. summit.    AL-SAFIR reports that one ring member who was arrested  recently was tasked with assassinating a high-ranking official.  The authorities have also foiled a plan to assassinate a  minister and a senior military official.    Citing well-informed sources, AL-SAFIR says the Israel  agencies and another, non-Israeli, party have drawn up a plan to  weaken Syria's position. They want to weaken President  al-Asad's position ahead of the Geneva summit with President  Clinton. So they planned to embarrass him in Lebanon.    This information follows Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin's recent visit to the occupied border strip and his veiled  threats against Lebanon and Syria.</p>

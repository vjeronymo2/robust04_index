			<p>BFN     [Text] London, April 26 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher said today that Bosnian Serbs must do more to  avert the threat of NATO air strikes.    Speaking to reporters after talks with British Foreign  Secretary Douglas Hurd, Christopher said the Serbs had not yet  done enough to avoid the threat of being bombed.    "The information I have this morning is that the Serbs have  moved a number of heavy weapons outside the 20 km zone, but  there are a number still there," he said.    "It is clear that today will be an important day to see if  they really will comply with requirements," he stressed.    Hurd also told reporters that he hoped the Serbs would pull  back completely.    "If they don't then they know there will be air strikes  against them," he warned.    Christopher and Hurd conferred as the "contact group", made  up of high-level officials of the United States, Russia, the  European Union and the United Nations, its first meeting in  London [as received] to coordinate efforts to bring peace to  Bosnia.    NATO has given the Serbs until 0001 GMT on Wednesday [27  April] to pull back all heavy weapons to at least 20 km from the  U.N. safe haven of Gorazde.</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Technology: Teeing off with virtual golf - Japan's players are competing on screen Japan's golf lovers cannot seem to get enough of the game, despite the high prices and traffic jams they must bear to indulge their passion. Technology, however, has stepped in to take some of the trouble away for the avid golfer intent on conquering his favourite course complete with lakes, trees and bunkers. The Tour Simulator golf machine developed by Mizuno, a Japanese sports goods company, recreates a round of golf on famous courses, taking the player from starting tee to finishing green with the help of a screen, two computers, cameras and a laser disc player. The system can be set up in any room big enough to allow four players to hit a golf ball against the 3m-high canvas screen. The game starts with the players choosing one of the courses Mizuno has captured on laser disc in 3,600 photographic images, or 200 photographs per hole. A long-distance view of the course comes on screen. Players choose how many holes they want to play, the tee position and even the speed and direction of the wind they prefer to battle against. When the first hole comes on screen a voice describes the hole and offers advice on how best to tackle it. After the player has hit the ball, it is shown on the screen as it flies through the air and lands somewhere on the fairway. For the visual representation of the ball's flight, the screen uses data provided by a computer which has calculated exactly how and where the ball would have flown, depending on the strength and angle of the player's stroke. When the player hits the ball, his swing is photographed by two cameras using high-speed shutters. One of the cameras is set up to the side of the player to capture the speed and angle of the ball while the other camera is fixed to the ceiling and captures the direction of the ball from above. A microphone on the ground by the tee alerts the camera as the player hits the ball and triggers a high-speed strobe light which flashes several times per second. The multiple images that are captured are then sent to an image interpreter connected to a computer. The computer analyses the speed of the ball and the distance travelled. It then tells with the laser disc player (which stores images of the golf course) where the ball should have landed based on data such as the angle at which the ball was hit, the speed and direction of the ball, and the chosen speed and strength of the wind. Using that data, the laser disc player chooses a view of the golf course where the ball should have landed and projects it on to the screen. The distance to the hole and the player's score up to that point are given on the screen. There are other treats such as contours that faithfully recreate each particular green on the chosen course and a movable tee to simulate the difficulty of hitting a ball that has landed in the rough. If the ball should, according to the computer's calculations, have landed in the lake, the screen image and sound of splashing water will recreate that, too. The system uses conventional 16-bit computers with software developed specially by Mizuno's engineering and development department, a division of the company which also developed shoes for the athlete Carl Lewis. Mizuno engineers took a year to develop the virtual golf system, which costs Y13m (Pounds 78,000) and has been installed in 40 places throughout the country. Similar systems have been developed by other manufacturers. But virtual golf is not a Japanese idea. It was thought up in the US by Ingolf of California to enable golfers to practise swings in their garages. Ingolf, also active in Japan, now plans to link up its indoor golfing plazas around the world by satellite and computer networks so that teams can play each other. Considering the size of the average Japanese home, the next high-tech hit in Japan might be a virtual American home.</p>

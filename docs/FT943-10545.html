			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Still shopping as the margins drop: Now the battle for Wm Low is over, where will big UK food retailers find growth opportunities The battle for control of Scottish supermarket group William Low was the first bidding war between the UK's two largest grocery retailers - Tesco and J Sainsbury. It may not be the last. Tesco won the fight yesterday with a bid of 360p a share, valuing the 57-store Wm Low group at Pounds 247m - some Pounds 93m higher than in its original bid three weeks ago. Sainsbury, which bid 305p last week, decided the price was too high and withdrew, saving itself for other fights ahead. Other contests are almost certain to follow. The two grocers went into battle for control of Wm Low not just because of the opportunity it offered to buy market share quickly in one of the few regions in which both are under-represented. They were also motivated by the changing structure of the industry, which has raised the question of whether the big groups can continue to expand by building new superstores. They may have to look elsewhere - overseas or back in the high street - for earnings growth. From the mid-1980s until late 1992, profits and share prices of the 'big three' grocery retailers - Sainsbury, Tesco and Argyll (owner of Safeway) - soared as they moved hundreds of stores from high streets into purpose-built, retailing palaces on the edge of towns. By getting ever better deals from suppliers, increasing the proportion of higher-margin own-label products, and introducing sophisticated computer and distribution systems, they increased profit margins substantially. Last year, however, food retailers' shares began to underperform the market as the City realised that the formula for growth could not continue for much longer. The Pounds 10bn spent on building new superstores by the big three in the previous five years had led to a shortage of possible sites in parts of the country. Moreover, since 1990 a new breed of foreign discount grocers - limited-range, low-priced stores - had taken root alongside the established UK discounter, Kwik Save, and threatened to force superstores to cut prices. Fears about growth prospects were initially played down by the superstore groups, but the events of the past year have marked a watershed: May 1993: Gateway, the UK's sixth-largest supermarket, opened price skirmishing by permanently reducing the cost of 1,000 products. July 1993: Mr Archie Norman, chief executive of Asda, the fourth-largest superstore group - which also cut prices - warned 'halcyon days' were over for food retailers. August 1993: Intensifying the price war, Tesco launched a 'Tesco Value' range of cheap own-label products designed to counter the threat from discounters. October 1993: Sainsbury cut the price of 300 own-label products indefinitely. December 1993: Argyll became the first superstore group to announce it was reducing its spending on expansion. It also began to depreciate the value of existing stores in its accounts. Its move was soon followed by Tesco and Sainsbury. All admit price competition had reduced their gross margins. April-June 1994: Sainsbury and Tesco reported their smallest profits increases for a decade; Argyll reported its first profits fall. The question now is whether price competition will continue to escalate, leading to a downward spiral in margins. Mr Jeremy Alun-Jones, European retailing analyst at US investment bank Lehman Brothers, points out that the big three food retailers are still committed to spending more than Pounds 1bn a year until 1997 on new stores. In a saturated market, he argues, they may be forced to keep cutting prices in an attempt to achieve enough sales through these stores to earn a return on their investment. Such an outlook might be too pessimistic. While parts of the UK have little room for new superstores, some areas are under-provided - most obviously Scotland. Moreover, the big grocers argue that, although margins have fallen, they will not necessarily continue to decline. Both Sir Ian MacLaurin and Mr David Sainsbury, chairmen of Tesco and Sainsbury respectively, say that reducing prices on the kind of basic products sold by the discount chains has neutralised the discounters' threat. 'We have really hurt the discounters. They have no room to cut prices further,' said Mr Sainsbury when he unveiled the group's latest results in May. Discounters are indeed finding life difficult. Shares in Shoprite, the discount grocer which operates mainly in Scotland, plunged last month after profits for the six months to May came in well below expectations and the company warned that full-year profits would be similarly disappointing. Nevertheless, the continuing price competition from the discounters means margins are unlikely to creep up again. Moreover, even if there are still places where the groups can build new superstores, this is unlikely to be the case by the end of the century. Both factors will make superstore expansion in the UK less attractive. How, then, can the superstore groups continue to grow? One possibility is that they may begin to put stores back into the high street. Tesco and Sainsbury have developed small town-centre formats, Metro and Central respectively. They say increased buying power and efficiency means they can trade more profitably from small stores than they could 10 years ago. That, combined with the comparatively low cost of leasehold property for small stores, means they can earn similar returns from these stores as from freehold superstores. Sir Ian MacLaurin said yesterday Tesco had identified 80 potential sites in the UK for its Metro stores and estimated that, in spite of the superstore expansion of recent years, 30 per cent of grocery spending was still in high-street shops. 'That is clearly an opportunity for us. We have the technical skills to run quite small stores profitably now,' he said. The battle for Wm Low could thus be followed by further bids from the big three grocers for smaller supermarket groups with high-street stores, such as Gateway, Iceland or the Co-operative retailers. But with a typical Tesco Metro only a quarter the size of a new superstore, moving back into the high street will not offer the same scope for growth as superstore expansion did in the 1980s. Another option for expansion may be to go into other forms of retailing. Sainsbury has tried this with its Homebase DIY and Savacentre hypermarket chains. It says these will account for increasing proportions of capital spending in coming years. Similarly, the big three, which have long operated petrol stations alongside their superstores, may become operators of standalone petrol stations. Tesco is already doing so at three London sites; Sainsbury is considering it. A final expansion route for UK superstore groups is likely to be acquisitions abroad. Tesco bought the 92-branch Catteau supermarket group in France last year, and admits this was a way of gaining overseas experience with a view to other purchases. In 1987, Sainsbury bought Shaws, the US supermarket chain of 87 stores, and says it will examine opportunities to add to that chain. UK retailers' experience overseas has been mixed. Marks and Spencer, for instance, has struggled to make north American acquisitions perform well - though it has had more success in Europe. But as opportunities for building out-of-town superstores dry up and the limited potential for returning to the high street is filled, the next wave of expansion may have to be overseas.  ----------------------------------  THE TOP 10 FOOD RETAILING GROUPS  ---------------------------------- Rank     Group       % Market share  ---------------------------------- 1        Sainsbury            15.06 2        Tesco                13.47 3        Argyll                9.47 4        Asda                  8.04 5        Somerfield (Gateway)  5.39 6        Kwiksave              4.90 7        Marks &amp; Spencer       3.94 8        CWS                   2.84 9        Wm.

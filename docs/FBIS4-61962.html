			<p>BFN     [Text] As Interfax learned from well-informed sources in  Russia's Foreign Ministry, during his visit to Germany on May  11-13 President Boris Yeltsin will try to talk the Germans into  conducting the ceremony of farewell to the Russian troops in  Berlin, not in Weimar. "The President is firmly resolved to  reach this goal," a high-ranking Russian diplomat told Interfax.    According to him, "there is no logic in conducting the  ceremony of farewell to the Western allies in Berlin, a city  conquered by Soviet troops, and saying farewell to the Russians  in Weimar, a city conquered by the allied troops."    As he said, "the striving to say farewell to the Russians in  Weimar, where no Reichstag was stormed and no victory banner was  hoisted, reflects the desire to erase from the memory of the  Germans some history chapters, particularly the quadrilateral  allied responsibility for Germany."    The issue of Russia's Kaliningrad Region may also be  discussed during President Yeltsin's visit to Germany, the  diplomat said. "This may take place during his confidential  conversation with Chancellor Helmut Kohl," he said.    Moscow's attitude to Kaliningrad and Kaliningrad Region  remains unchanged, Interfax's interviewee stressed. "This is  Russian land, and we shall surrender it to no one," he pointed  out.    According to Interfax's interviewee, "some circles in  Germany  are trying to kindle the issue concerning Kaliningrad's status  in the hope that in the future it will become possible to raise  it officially." "There will be no such possibility," he  stressed.    The diplomat spoke in favor of "levelling up" ties between  Kaliningrad Region and Germany. "It's clear that Germany,  because of its economic might at least, will be ahead of Sweden  or, say, Lithuania in trade with Kaliningrad Region. However,  in terms of economic cooperation, Kaliningrad Region must not  and will not be oriented solely to Germany," he noted.</p>

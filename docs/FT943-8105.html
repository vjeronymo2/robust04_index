			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / World Trade News: China in Dollars 888m coal pipeline deal - A US-led consortium is embarking on an ambitious plan China yesterday signed an agreement with a US-led consortium for construction of what is billed as the world's longest coal slurry pipeline in an Dollars 888m project due to be completed by 1997. The agreement between Pittsburgh-based Custom Coals and China's Ministry of Coal Industry provides for 51 per cent foreign ownership and is the 'first infrastructure project of its kind in China to have western financial and management control', according to the US partners. Mr Robert Horton, president of Custom Coals, said the 500-mile pipeline from Shanxi province in China's north-west to the coastal province of Shandong could open the way for many such projects to service the world's biggest coal producer. The Chinese transport system is greatly over-stretched, and with coal shipment representing 40 per cent of the country's rail traffic, a coal slurry pipeline will provide a much needed alternative. The Yu-Wei project agreed yesterday will include the construction and operation of a coal cleaning plant, pipeline and port facilities. Custom Coals will also supply coal-cleaning technology, which it says will greatly reduce China's coal-burning costs. 'The potential environmental benefits of this project to China are enormous,' said Mr Horton. 'China is the world's largest coal user, burning approximately 1.2bn tonnes in 1993 - one-third of the world's total hard coal consumption. 'If, based on the demonstrated economics of this project, China begins burning clean coal on a widespread basis, it would provide the single largest benefit to the earth's environment of any environmental policy or initiative - far greater than full implementation of the US Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.' The pipeline will have an annual capacity of 15m tonnes, of which around 5m tonnes will be supplied to local power stations. A further 8m tonnes a year is likely to be sold to purchasers in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan under long-term contracts, said Mr Horton. The balance will go to the spot market. China Pipeline Holdings, the US-led consortium that will have developmental and operational control of the project, also includes Australian-based MRI, owned by Mr Peter Oei, a Hong Kong businessman. The consortium will seek equity partners in the international market and Goldman Sachs (Asia) will assist with fund-raising. Financing is expected to include government-backed loans and suppliers' credits, although the ratio of debt to equity has not been finalised. Equity participants could expect a 20 per cent return on their investment, said Mr Horton. Ownership of the project will pass to the Chinese government after 50 years. The consortium partners expect to spend Dollars 15m-Dollars 20m preparing for the construction phase. They expect to 'break ground' in mid-to-late 1995. Some Dollars 400m of the cost of the project will be spent on capital equipment. China's 49 per cent interest will be through the China Coal Construction and Development Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Ministry of Coal Industry.</p>

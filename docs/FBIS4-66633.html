			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] Washington, March 10 (PTI [Press Trust of India]  &amp;  UNI [United News of India]): Prime Minister Narasimha Rao has  warned that any move by the Clinton administration to modify the  Pressler amendment to renew aid to Pakistan would "force India  to reassess its defence policy."    This was conveyed by the Indian Prime Minister to US  Senators, according to a report to the Senate by Republican  Senators Tad Cochran, Larry Pressler and Hank Brown, who visited  India recently and met Mr. Rao.    Rao and several other Indian leaders the Senators met  deplored the harm done to Indo-American relations by the  statements of Assistant Secretary of State, Ms. Robin Raphel, on  Kashmir, questioning the State's permanent accession to India.    When the US Charge D'Affaires, Mr. Kenneth Brill, tried to  find an excuse for her by saying that Raphel's statement was  casual and "off the record" (which was not true, her briefing to  correspondents from South Asia was on "background", i.e.,  attributable to a senior administration official), Rao reported:  "The statement was nevertheless appalling. Wherever it came from  and whatever the motivation, it hurts."    Though the Senators visited India in December last year, Mr.  Rao's statement on Pressler amendment acquires significance in  the wake of reports of Clinton administration's proposal to seek  a one-time waiver to the amendment to allow Pakistan acquire the  deadly F-16S.    The Senators quoted Rao as saying: "The Prime Minister moved  immediately to the Indo-Pakistan relationship, especially the  Kashmir situation and the destabilising impact of any change in  the Pressler amendment's restrictions on US aid to Pakistan  because of its nuclear programme."    It was in this context he said that any move to change  Pressler and resume aid to Pakistan "would force India to  reassess its defence policy."    Rao told the Senators that statements on Kashmir by  officials  like Robin Raphel would not improve Indo-US relations.    When Senator Brown said that India's economic reforms were  significant but relatively unknown in the US and that a visit by  the Prime Minister would be well-received especially by the US  financial community, Rao said his Ambassador in Washington  (Siddhartha Shankar Ray) had also been urging him to visit the  US.    The F-16 aircraft had been on order with Lockheed  Corporation, but deliveries had been barred under Pressler  amendment restrictions, although Islamabad had paid an advance  of 658 million dollars. The stymied aircraft deal has been a  sore point in Pak-US relations and Islamabad has left no stone  unturned in its lobbying efforts with the administration and  members of Congress to clear the deal.    Mr. Frank Wisner, Under Secretary for Defense, informed  Senator Pressler of the administration's intention to consider a  one-time lifting of the Pressler amendment in order to  accommodate the aircraft deal. Senator Pressler told reporters  that he was concerned at the move, which was likely to be made  at the House-Senate Conference committee on the State  Department's Appropriations Bill, since a one-time exception  would practically amount to repealing the amendment.    "It is the only piece of non-proliferation legislation on  the  books, and I think we should be building on it," the Senator  said. "Bringing F-16's into the region would trigger another  arms race," he added.    As soon as he was informed about the move, Sen. Pressler  wrote to President Bill Clinton yesterday, seeking "five minutes  at your earliest convenience to discuss nuclear  non-proliferation policy." To stress the urgency of the  situation, the Senator offered to meet "in your office, or  during a morning run."    The letter makes clear Sen. Pressler's deep concerns over  the  issue: "Should such a meeting prove impossible to schedule, I  will raise this issue the next time I am at the White House, or  if you should visit the Senate.    While I would rather not raise this issue in such a public  setting, I think it is critical for the administration, to send  a consistent signal about the importance of nuclear  non-proliferation.    "Copies of the letter to the President have been sent to  Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Defence Secretary  William Perry, which suggests, that Sen. Pressler intends to  take up the issue with the two officials.    Sen. Pressler pointed out that the Clinton administration  last November had proposed draft foreign aid legislation that  would leave out country-specific language, in effect putting an  end to the Pakistan-specific Pressler amendment.    But in the face of determined opposition from Sen. Pressler,  Senator John Glenn of Ohio and others, the administration beat a  hasty retreat, claiming that even if the Pressler amendment had  been repealed, aid to Pakistan would not have been provided as  long as Pakistan retained its nuclear weapons capability.    "I want the people to know what is being proposed," Sen.  Pressler said. What the defence department was proposing was  inconsistent with the position of the State department. He  called on all concerned citizens to write to their legislators  to take up the matter with members of the House-Senate  Conference Committee.    Sen. Pressler said he believed that part of the reason for  the new move was, pressure on the Defence Department by Lockheed  Corporation.</p>

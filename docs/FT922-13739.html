			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Bundesbank warns on state aid for east ECONOMIC recovery in east Germany could be held up considerably if Bonn plays too interventionist a role in the region's industry, the Bundesbank warns in its annual report released yesterday. The central bank also repeats its concern that the value of the D-Mark, as well as German economic growth and employment, was at risk from inflation and the weak state of foreign economies. The bank made clear it had no intention yet of relaxing monetary policy. It said consumer prices last year rose at their steepest rate since 1983. Interest rates reached a post-war high in December. While the annual inflation rate in March was more than 4.5 per cent, the strength of demand in the construction sector had pushed up building prices by 7 per cent. The bank repeated its warnings about high wage increases, saying these would endanger stability. On east Germany, the Bundesbank opposed any attempt at 'industrial policy', saying: 'This could delay the necessary economic restructuring and increase the risk that east Germany would remain an economically weak region for a long time.' The Bundesbank's view highlights a central dilemma of policy towards east Germany. The government wants to avoid social unrest by keeping as many people in work as possible, but also sees the need for a full-scale overhaul of industry there. Thus uncompetitive sectors like shipbuilding and chemicals are being supported in the hope of eventual recovery after costly restructuring. In this context, the Bundesbank again stressed the need to bring down state borrowing and budget deficits, which have shot up as a result of unification. Germany's public finances could be burdened too much if transfer payments to east Germany - likely to total DM180bn (Pounds 63bn) - continue to be high while more financial help is also required for eastern Europe and EC financial demands increase.</p>

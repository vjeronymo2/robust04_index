			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / International Company News: Metal prices hurt MIM Holdings LOW world metal prices caused MIM Holdings, the Australian mining group, to dip into the red in the final quarter, but the group reported only a marginal decline in operating earnings for the full year to the end of June, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney. Operating earnings fell marginally from ADollars 87m to ADollars 85.1m (USDollars 56.8m) on an 8 per cent improvement in revenue to ADollars 2.02bn. The dividend is being held at 5 cents a share. Abnormal items including large divestments, write-offs and currency fluctuations, had a substantial influence on earnings available to shareholders. This caused bottom line earnings to fall 30.4 per cent to ADollars 74.0m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by provisional President Emile Jonassaint on 18 May, </F> Haitian Flag and University Day, from his home in Freres,  Petion-Ville -- recorded]    [Text] My dear fellow citizens: Here we are, at a moment in  our history at which we are duty-bound to think about the causes  that have torn asunder the fabric of the nation. The fatherland  today calls for an awakening in all diverted and manipulated  consciences, invites them to save our ancestors' legacy. Yes,  the legacy is a heavy one; nevertheless, we must find the  strength to bear it together. On this 18 May 1994, I am saying  to you, here, the same thing I said in Arcahaie 44 years ago on  behalf of the Senate of the Republic. Let us again take this day  to pass to one another the torch of unity. Let us forget our  resentments, hatreds, and quarrels, sources of deep bruises for  the nation, so as to examine our motto: In Unity Lies Strength.    On this 18 May 1994 here we are, again, at a watershed in  our  history, when the unity of this people is as urgent a need as it  was on the day of our independence, so that we can compel  recognition as a nation.    My dear fellow citizens: Already nearly 200 years ago,  rallied behind the flag, on behalf of peace and the universal  rights of citizens, we fought the decisive battle for freedom,  thereby responding to the cries of despair and sufferings of  millions of men and women remaining in the enemy's chains. Let  us unite.    The symbol of a rallying and of solidarity among the  population, our bi-colored flag still highlights the proud epic  of our ancestors. I want this anniversary to be used to  reconcile Haitians among themselves, as brothers from the same  nation. The anguished fatherland today has the right to solemnly  demand the help of its children. It does not wish to believe  that its own sons could exacerbate even further the wounds of  its distress. [As an] achievement of our people's pride,  although our flag is rent asunder, let us recover the shreds, so  that we can again hoist our bi-colored flag before the world.  Let us together protect its honor.    In Unity Lies Strength. Hail Haiti! Thank you.</p>

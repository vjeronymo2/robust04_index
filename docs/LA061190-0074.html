			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PISTONS FEEL RIGHT AT HOME;  </P> <P> NBA FINALS: DETROIT'S 121-106 VICTORY IN PORTLAND IS ITS FIRST THERE IN 16  YEARS, AND GIVES THE DEFENDING CHAMPIONS A 2-1 SERIES LEAD.  </P> <P> For Blazermaniacs hoping to spend the week reminding America how overlooked  they are, there was a little reversal.  </P> <P> In mid-bellow of righteous indignation Sunday, they took a shot to the  collective Adam's apple from Detroit's Bad Boys, who turned the NBA finals  around again, beating the Trail Blazers, 121-106, in their own beloved, little,  packed, loud Memorial Coliseum.  </P> <P> It was the first home loss for the Blazers this postseason and the Pistons'  first victory here in 16 years.  </P> <P> It gave Detroit, which had just lost the homecourt advantage in this series,  its edge back. The Pistons lead the series, 2 games to 1. Game 4 will be played  here Tuesday night.  </P> <P> In Game 3, the Pistons were led by Joe Dumars, who ended his slump with 33  points -- and then learned of the death of his father.  </P> <P> Joe III's father, Joe Jr., died of heart failure in Natchitoches, La., shortly  before the game, after two weeks in intensive care. The family asked that Joe  III not be told until game's end. The only Piston player who knew was Isiah  Thomas.  </P> <P> "I thought about it a couple times out there," Thomas said. "He made one shot  today, going down the lane, the shot clock running down, where he threw it real  high in the air and it went in. We kind of looked at each other and smiled.  </P> <P> "I said to myself, 'Your dad threw that one in. Because you sure as hell didn't  make it.' "  </P> <P> For those familiar with Trail Blazer history, the day started in somewhat  familiar fashion, like a sort of Oregon Brigadoon.  </P> <P> Rising, as if from years of slumber, was Rip City, no less boisterous than that  championship season of 1977.  </P> <P> The Trail Blazers, back from their Game 2 victory in Auburn Hills, Mich., with  their overpowering home record, were in the driver's seat again and the local  fans could thus walk their pet gripes.  </P> <P> They arrived Sunday brandishing posters galore, like one of the U.S. map with  an arrow pointing to Portland and the words "You Are Here." They derided CBS'  Hubie Brown, who has fumbled Trail Blazer names; he was welcomed as Hoggie,  Hoobie, Hubie Stockmon and Hubie Musburger.  </P> <P> Get it? Nobody knows who the Trail Blazers are. Boo-hoo.  </P> <P> The Blazermaniacs thought they had problems? The actual game brought real  trouble.  </P> <P> Portland, as expected, came out flying and grabbed an 8-2 lead. The Pistons,  not as expected, shot their way back into the game.  </P> <P> The Pistons didn't have ace stopper Dennis Rodman, who sat out with his  sprained ankle. Dumars and Vinnie Johnson were in inopportune slumps. Suddenly  all that Bad Boy stuff looked like a lot of hype for a one-year dynasty.  </P> <P> "It's like the ultimate challenge for us," murmured Thomas before Game 3, while  Johnson declined interviews and Dumars explained that the groin the Detroit  medical staff said was fine, was hurting him.  </P> <P> "We haven't been in a position like this for a while. We'll see how our team  responds."  </P> <P> The response was the Pistons' finest moment in their three NBA finals of  1988-89-90, since Game 1 of the '88 series, when they beat the Lakers in the  Forum.  </P> <P> The twin slumps of the Piston shooting guards ended in withering volleys.  Dumars had 10 points by the end of the first quarter, when Johnson entered.  </P> <P> Dumars is generally a good shooter, but Johnson is something else. It could be  said that the Microwave's whole career is a slump, punctuated by awesome  bursts. He shot 43% in the regular season. He was four for 25 in his last four  games. An unplugged Microwave can stay that way for weeks.  </P> <P> For those suspecting ebbing confidence, suspect again.  </P> <P> "I'm from Brooklyn," Johnson announced later. "I'm built on confidence."  </P> <P> Let's just say he didn't run away from any shots. He canned a 15-footer the  first time he touched the ball and was off to a 15-point second quarter and a  nine-for-13, 21-point day.  </P> <P> What, Daly worry?  </P> <P> "When Vinnie came into the game," Daly said later, "Isiah said to me we'd  better not go to him right away because he's not warmed up.  </P> <P> "I said, 'Zeke, I've been coaching him seven years and he's as likely to hit  that one as one 10 minutes down the road.' "  </P> <P> The Blazers had other problems. Bill Laimbeer kept drawing charging fouls, or  fouls by Trail Blazers setting screens. He put two quick ones on Kevin  Duckworth, which resulted in Ducky's quick departure and the abandonment of the  inside game in favor of many Clyde Drexler launches, few of which went in.  </P> <P> Laimbeer then proceeded to draw four of Buck Williams' six fouls. Buck, the  Trail Blazers' heart and soul, was held to 27 minutes, five points and three  rebounds. Maybe Laimbeer prefers something else to the Duck'n'Buck Show.  </P> <P> There were several things the Blazers could have said to Laimbeer:  </P> <P> A) Congratulations.  </P> <P> B) Nice game.  </P> <P> C) No comment.  </P> <P> D) He cheated.  </P> <P> They went for C and D.  </P> <P> "I have no comment on Laimbeer," Trail Blazer Coach Rick Adelman said.  </P> <P> "I like Laimbeer," said Williams. "What I get upset with is when he flops and  he gets calls for it. Everybody in the world knows what an exceptional flopper  he is. He's made it an art. But everyone knows that."  </P> <P> Said Duckworth: "It's a crying shame."  </P> <P> The Pistons grabbed a 31-27 lead at the end of the first quarter, increased it  to 58-51 at the half and 90-82 at the end of three quarters.  </P> <P> They then held Portland scoreless for the first 3:45 of the fourth quarter,  grabbed a 16-point lead and were never threatened.  </P> <P> Laimbeer, foolish enough to grouse out loud about the rainy local weather,  fouled out late and left to a standing ovation of boos.  </P> <P> He took a little bow. He couldn't have been happier. For the Blazermaniacs, it  was scant consolation, but on this saddest of Oregon days, the only tiny bit  available.  </P> <P> NBA Notes  </P> <P> Rick Adelman criticized the referees. "Incredible," he said. "It was different  at one end than it was at the other. There's a different way some people can  play and other people can play. That was obvious today." . . . The Trail  Blazers reportedly believe referee Jake O'Donnel has it in for Buck Williams,  but when asked about it, all refused comment. . . . Commendation: Isiah Thomas  played as steady a game as he ever has in the finals, making six of his eight  shots, scoring 21 points with eight assists.  </P> <P> Their Yugo broke down: Portland guard Drazen Petrovic missed all five of his  shots and Vinnie Johnson and Joe Dumars smoked him at every opportunity. . . .  More bricks: Portland's Cliff Robinson went one for seven. Clyde Drexler's  outside shot, which helped win Game 2, went back to wherever it usually is. He  was nine for 23, one for six from three-point range.  </P> <P> * JOE DUMARS: Piston guard learns after Game 3 that his father died. Story, C6.  </P></p>

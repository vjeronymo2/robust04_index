			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Peugeot-Citroen hopes for recovery in second half PEUGEOT-CITROEN has been hit by falling sales, higher stocks and costs, and lower margins in the first half of this year. However, the French carmaker hopes that a second-half recovery in sales will keep it in profit for 1993. Mr Jacques Calvet, the group's president, warned that the company might have to add to the 2,600 lay-offs it had already planned to make this year. He said that the group had lost ground in a European market which itself dropped by 17.3 per cent in January-May this year, compared with the same period of 1992. Peugeot-Citroen's share of the European market fell slightly to 11.8 per cent in the first five months of this year, compared with its 12.2 per cent average last year. Mr Calvet told the annual shareholders' meeting that June had been more encouraging for the group's sales. In a market which he believed would contract overall by 13 per cent over the full year, he forecast that Peugeot-Citroen would raise its market share to 13 per cent, with helpful publicity coming from the triumph of the Peugeot 905 in the Le Mans 24-hour race. But the car group would have to reduce its stocks of unsold cars, which were too high, he said. The cost of carrying these stocks was outweighing the positive effect of lower French interest rates, leading financial costs to rise slightly to FFr1.5bn (Dollars 262.7m) this year, Mr Calvet said. The Peugeot president said that he was sticking to his plan for a 12 per cent improvement in productivity this year, to be achieved by more job cuts and de-stocking.</p>

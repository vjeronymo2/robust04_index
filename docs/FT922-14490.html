			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Observer: Loggerheads Clearly one of the few points of agreement between Liffe and LTOM, London's recently-married futures and equity options exchanges, was to skip the honeymoon. With the pre-nuptual aggro far from over, voting takes place this week for six LTOM members to join the Liffe board. Liffe, privately dismayed at the presence among the 13 nominees of five members from the old LTOM board, fears the arrival of an equity options pressure group. The options boys having failed to secure a managing director to fight their corner, are continuing the war by other means. Indeed, there are some surprising candidates, not least Gerald Freedman. His Smith New Court refused to take on market-making obligations, so showing less than total commitment to the new venture even if, as he protests, it is still one of the most active players on the floor. Other candidates vaunt their intimate association with the market since its inception - hardly the most promising qualification for candidacy given LTOM's miserable failure hitherto. The old LTOM was a cosy club, lining the pockets of a favoured few while the creation of a thriving com- petitive equity options exchange went by the board. Liffe thinks too many old faces might seek to justify that past. Instead of arguing about who 'really understands equity options' - a claim that could be premature for either side - the unhappy couple might consider generating some togetherness out on the road, selling what most other countries have found to be an eminently saleable product.</p>

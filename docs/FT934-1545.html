			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / EU and US agree oilseeds deal European Union farm ministers yesterday hammered out a deal on implementing an oilseeds accord with the US in an all-night session at the end of a five-day meeting, Reuter reports from Brussels. The oilseeds pact was part of a wider deal to cut farm subsidies struck in Washington more than a year ago. It restricts to 5.12m hectares the area in the EU that can be planted with sunflowers, rapeseed and soyabeans. Ministers agreed a mechanism to protect farmers from price cuts if their currencies strengthen too much and ironed out differences on a scheme to set land aside to curb cereals output.</p>

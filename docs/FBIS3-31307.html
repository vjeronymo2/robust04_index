			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Atanas Matev commentary: "....For Balkan States In </F> Particular"]    [Text] Tension within NATO circles has been greatly  escalating over the last two or three days and is growing to an  unprecedented level. Naturally, it is related to the ultimatum  against the Bosnian Serbs that was recently adopted.    Are the conditions of the ultimatum likely to be fulfilled,  or will it become necessary for NATO to embark on its first  combat actions since its establishment 45 years ago? If there  should be some fighting, how are the military operations going  to proceed? Should only air power be involved, or can we expect  ground forces to intervene as well? If such an intervention  should become necessary, which NATO member countries would agree  to send their soldiers to a he Bosnian battlefield from which  many would not return alive? The probable refusal of several  countries, if not of all the NATO members, to send their boys to  certain death would cause irreparable damage to the prestige of  the organization, which was most widely propagated as a lever  and source of stability in the world after the fall of  communism? Is the loss of such prestige not likely to be a  death sentence for NATO?    With the approach of the ultimatum's deadline, such and  other  questions are being increasingly frequently asked within NATO's  leading circles.    It is strange but their answers should have been clear even  as early as a few days ago while NATO was deciding what actions  to take in Bosnia after the massacre on Sarajevo's market  square. This is what a policy based on wisdom, rather than on  emotions, should be all about.    Let us hope that NATO's policy regarding the events in  Bosnia  is based on wisdom, rather than on emotions. In the opposite  case, not only is NATO's future at stake, but many rather  dangerous things are involved, which apply to the Balkan states  in particular.</p>

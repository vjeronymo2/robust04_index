			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Johannesburg Feb 2 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party  [IFP] supporters ruled the streets of Thokoza on Wednesday [2  Wednesday] as they marched to protest against the withdrawal of  the police's Internal Stability Division [ISD] from East Rand  townships and its replacement by SA Defence Force [SADF] troops  -- announced on Tuesday in the release of the peace plan for the  region. While most peacefully demonstrated down Khumalo Street,  a small criminal element from the Thokoza hostel looted shops,  robbed street vendors, stoned passing cars, intimidated the  elderly and stripped cars.    IFP supporters who sat on the Khumalo Street bridge refused  an invitation by SADF regional commanding officer Cmdt Michael  de Goede to be part of SADF policing. The IFP believes black  SADF soldiers sent to Thokoza are in cahoots with the African  National Congress [ANC] and has cited situations where the SADF  has allegedly harassed and even killed IFP supporters.    "I want to work closely with you. You can even work with my  soldiers on patrol," Cmdt de Goede said, appealing to the  militant crowd to give the SADF a chance to create peace and  stability.    The crowd called for "stability, stability" and refused to  negotiate with Cmdt de Goede. They told him if the ISD had to  go, the SADF should be removed as well. One angry man said: "We  would rather be left to fight it out to the death with the ANC.  At least then we will have a fair chance."    Roads into Thokoza were heavily blockaded by SADF troops on  Wednesday, while IFP supporters set up their own blockades with  taxis inside the township.    Hundreds of terrified pensioners collecting their money were  trapped inside the Thokoza Town Council offices while IFP  supporters, armed with pangas, axes, knobkerries and steel bars,  threatened to rob them. Payment of pensions totalling more that  R[Rand]3 million was postponed until Thursday, the venue was  transferred to Wadeville in Germiston and the pensioners were  escorted home by SADF troops.    Violence nearly erupted when ANC supporters celebrating the  ISD's announced withdrawal marched to the foot of the bridge to  confront the IFP gathering. The IFP supporters and SADF troops  took cover when shots were fired from the residential area but  nobody was injured or arrested. Cars forced to stop at the taxi  blockade were stripped.    Reporters watched while a masked man and his gang smashed  car  windows and made off with radios, tape-decks and tyres.    Taxis passing on the highway were stoned and street vendors  were chased away and their stalls were looted.    IFP Transvaal Chairman Themba Khoza, in the township to  quell  the unrest and negotiate with the police, said the impromptu  gathering was the consequence of the ANC and government making  decisions without consulting the IFP. He was referring to the  East Rand peace plan.    An eight-member task group has been appointed to oversee the  plan, but so far the IFP has refused invitations to join the  peace process.    East Rand Deputy Commissioner Maj-Gen Obie Oberholzer told  the IFP crowd police had not taken the decision to remove the  ISD from the area. "It was a political decision and I suggest  your leaders consult other political leaders," he said.    The crowd, waving posters which read "The TEC [Transitional  Executive Council] has fed us to the SADF" and "Umkhonto we  Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- MK] are back to kill us",  dispersed only when Mr Khoza agreed to set up an urgent meeting  with government ministers.    By late afternoon the area was still tense with IFP members  standing guard at Thokoza hostel, while residents gathered  across the road. A large SADF contingent with rifles at the  ready separated the two factions and armoured cars filled with  soldiers waited at street corners.</p>

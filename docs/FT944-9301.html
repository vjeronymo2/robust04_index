			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Observer: Timorous weather The Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum in Indonesia hardly set the world alight, despite the presence of more than 500 hacks and assorted national leaders. But Indonesian president Suharto did manage to pull one trick. Bogor, the site of the conference, is known for its downpours and the president was worried that Apec's great and not-so-good might get drenched when lining up for some serious photo-opportunities. So a rain man, or pawang hujan, was hired, and told to pray for dry weather. Sure enough, Bogor's skies were grey but there were no downpours. 'We told him (the pawang) that if it rained we wouldn't pay him,' said an Indonesian official. Better than some incentive schemes on offer in the vicinity.</p>

			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Bay Area veteran Tom Holland turns up with a substantial show of some 20 large  abstract paintings. In characteristic fashion, some hang on the wall while  others in plexiglass and aluminum formats are bent into three dimensions and  stand about, looking very much like sculpture. An impressive job called "Mann"  hangs from the ceiling like a giant mobile. We think of Frank Stella as the  artist who exploded painting into 3-D but -- if memory serves -- Holland was  there first, grommeting away.  </P> <P> Although lacking the high profile reputation of some of his peers, Holland is  an established talent who pursues his star steadily if sometimes unevenly. The  look of present work is slightly troubled and Neo-Expressionist. Formats  incline to dark, fuming Cubist envelopes shot through with wedges and shafts of  limpid color applied with frustrated tenacity. Their scrubby appearance is the  natural result of forcing paint onto resistant metal and plastic surfaces.  </P> <P> If these works could be played on a musical instrument, it would have to be an  organ with rich bass sonorities and flute-y high notes. The paintings are big  and Baroque, but if they have a theme it might be "What ever happened to the  good old days?" A painting on an oval format ruminates on the great moment of  Analytic Cubism in Paris. There are whiffs of Delaunay's Orphism in Holland's  symphonic color and of Constructivism in the way he puts it all together.  </P> <P> Thoughts of his own salad days in the '60s recall an artist like Ron Davis.  Mostly, however, the brooding, nostalgic character of the work ties Holland to  his own Bay Area tradition, its beginnings in visiting Abstract Expressionists  and its culmination in Richard Diebenkorn. To his credit, Holland rarely lapses  into eccentricity but fights the good fight for Serious Painting. As it has  been making a comeback of late, he seems to be winning.

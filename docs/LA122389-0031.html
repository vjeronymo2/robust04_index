			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TELEVISION COULD HAVE CLEARED THE GRAY AREA  </P> <P> The officials did not have the advantage that Chick Hearn, Stu Lantz and the  television audience had: We saw the Laker brawl from three different angles,  replayed about a half-dozen times. The officials' call of the fight was totally  out of line. Stuart Gray went on a one-man rampage and should have been the  only player ejected.  </P> <P> In this case, the officials would have made a much better call if they had  viewed the television coverage. Granted, basketball is probably much too  fast-moving for TV replays to settle most questionable calls; but in a drastic  case, such as Gray's outburst, the officials need the eyes of TV cameras.  </P> <P> KATHIE TARBELL, Huntington Beach  </P></p>

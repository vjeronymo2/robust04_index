			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sixth in series of reports entitled "Sights and Sounds of </F> Chinese Prisons" by staff reporter Tao Guangxiong (7118 0342  7160): "Qigong, Embroidery, and Psychological Corrective  Therapy"--Part 5 was published in the 25 May China DAILY REPORT]    [Text] Beijing, 25 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Many  criminals serving their terms in prison find it difficult to  quit their bad habits due to the weaknesses in their character  and psychology. In response to this, China's prisons have found  many extremely characteristic corrective methods in the course  of practice.  <H5>  Qigong Corrective Therapy </H5>   Every morning and evening, at the gate of Shanghai Municipal  Prison, one can find several lines of female prisoners  attentively practicing qigong to soft and relaxing music. After  practicing qigong for three years or more, many female prisoners  find that their health has obviously improved and their  willpower has strengthened.    Several years ago, Shanghai Municipal Prison and the  Municipal Qigong Scientific Research Institute were already  cooperating in exploring the practical corrective effect of  qigong in the reform of criminals, and their qigong training  topics on violent criminals and sex offenders have recently been  included as research subjects for this year by the China Medical  Association.    Violent criminals have an irritable and bellicose character.  They are ready to fight at the slightest provocation. The  prison authorities insist on having them practice slow "calming"  qigong. After several months, their irritable temper can be  effectively corrected. As for sex offenders, qigong training is  of particular significance in stabilizing their emotions,  creates a fine psychological environment, and optimizes their  psychological mechanisms. By practicing qigong, senile  prisoners can have their symptoms of senility improved or  completely eliminated. Moreover, their minds can be broadened  and their self-control increased.  <H5>  Embroidery Corrective Therapy </H5>   Early this year, Sun Chenggong had his prison term reduced.  He had been sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for theft,  robbery, and harming and hindering the execution of public  affairs. He was dissatisfied with the sentence when he was sent  to Shandong Beishu Prison and made an attempt to escape.    A small embroidery needle has changed his life. He told this  reporter that after he had been caught again in an escape  attempt, instructing cadres had him learn embroidery. He said  that he was not used to it at the beginning and felt  uncomfortable sitting just for a short while, but that later he  slowly mastered embroidery and his temper changed a lot.    Having bellicose and energetic violent criminals learn  embroidery, training their characters, and correcting their  behavior is a new method found by Beishu Prison in the practice  of reforming criminals. At an embroidery workshop, dozens of  male criminals quietly do embroidery work with their needles and  thread. They are not inferior to females in speed. A young  criminal said: This is also labor. Except for using the eyes,  it is lighter than other jobs. Moreover, I am energetic by  nature. I hated sitting, but embroidery can help reform me.  <H5>  Psychological Corrective Therapy </H5>   In-prison psychological counseling was initiated in Western  countries as early as in the twenties and thirties. Although  exploration of the feasibility of in-prison psychological  counseling has been carried out for only three to five years in  China, it is now being extensively adopted in prisons across  China.    According to a survey by Shanghai Municipal Prison, a  criminal entering a strange prison from the familiarity of  society will often be psychologically unbalanced and depressed  and feel at a loss or even tired of life. The incidence of the  psychology [as published] and cognitive retardation among  criminals is obviously higher than that among ordinary people.  The psychological problems of criminals not only hinder their  admission of guilt and observance of law and their reform, but  also bring difficulties to prison management.    In addition to offering special out-patient psychological  counseling services, Shanghai Municipal Prison also demands that  instructing cadres have some mastery of the knowledge of  psychology. It has also achieved good results in organizing a  series of studies on knowledge of psychology among prisoners so  that they can come to understand themselves and judge people and  things around them from a rational angle and so that they can  use psychology to explain the inexplicable phenomena and  feelings that once affected them and thus enhance the awareness  of reform.</p>

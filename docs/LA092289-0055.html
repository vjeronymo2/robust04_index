			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: NUDISTS IN BALBOA PARK? GLAD YOU ASKED THAT . . .  </P> <P> As a research librarian at the downtown San Diego library, Evelyn Kooperman  answers a lot of trivia questions about names, dates, quotations and other  oddball information.  </P> <P> She also reads a lot of books about San Diego County: 350 at last count.  </P> <P> Now she has married her two professional passions into a nifty, 406-page  paperback titled "San Diego Trivia" ($12.95, Silver Gate Publications).  </P> <P> It's got everything you never knew about local history, geography,  architecture, sports, music, art, theater, literature, place names, movies,  television, plants and animals.  </P> <P> Like:  </P> <P> * Who turned San Diego from a Democratic city to a Republican one?  </P> <P>  Land baron Alonzo Horton, who arrived in 1867 and announced that he would hire  only Republicans.  </P> <P>  * What county supervisor had to either resign or live in his barn?  </P> <P>  J.P.M. Rainbow in 1893. When the county line was redrawn, his house was in  Riverside, his barn in San Diego. He resigned.  </P> <P>  * How many of the 138 prostitutes arrested in the Nov. 10, 1912, raid on the  downtown red-light district promised to reform?  </P> <P>  Two. The others bought train tickets to Los Angeles. Most of the tickets  proved to be round-trip.  </P> <P>  * What San Diego mayor took office by climbing a ladder and crawling in a  window?  </P> <P>  John L. Sehon in 1905. His enemies said he was ineligible because he was a  retired Army captain, so he launched a preemptive strike.  </P> <P>  * Was there ever a nudist colony in Balboa Park?  </P> <P>  Yes, during the 1935-36 California Pacific International Exposition. But the  cops required the women to wear brassieres and G-strings; the men, loincloths.  </P> <P>  * What local city was named for a woman's first husband and then renamed for  her second husband?  </P> <P>  Santee. Raisin grower George Cowles settled the area in 1877 and called it  Cowlestown. His widow later married realtor Milton Santee.  </P> <P>  Kooperman, 43, a native San Diegan and graduate of San Diego State University,  says she got the idea for a trivia book after KFMB radio asked her two years  ago to submit some questions for a contest.  </P> <P> After that came nights and weekends of combing through books and old  newspapers. She's already dreaming of a second edition, after finishing 10 new  books on San Diego County.  </P> <P> The pursuit of trivia, she notes, is not a trivial matter.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Looking for a Perfect Fit  </P> <P> North County identity crisis.  </P> <P> The Palomar Pomerado Hospital District in Escondido has changed to the Palomar  Pomerado Health System. Presumably patients will be now systematized rather  than hospitalized.  </P> <P> In Encinitas, the city government has a contest to find a mascot or logo to  symbolize life on the suburban coast.  </P> <P> A suggestion: How about an adjustable-rate mortgage payment superimposed on a  BMW repair bill?  </P> <P> </P> <P> Knowing the Score  </P> <P> Political fallout:  </P> <P> * There was a reason you didn't see any pictures of Gov. George Deukmejian  standing beside Mayor Maureen O'Connor, Police Chief Bob Burgreen and  Councilwoman Gloria McColl before, during or after their meeting.  </P> <P> Before reluctantly agreeing to the meeting, the Duke put down an ironclad  condition: no news photos.  </P> <P> * Before we get giddy on the gassy rhetoric of populism, consider that John  Hartley won a City Council seat with fewer votes than any candidate in several  decades.  </P> <P> His 7,900 votes represent 1.3% of the city's registered voters. Explain to me  again how district elections ensure that the "voice of the people" will be  heard at City Hall.  </P> <P> * The "new politics" has some old political faces.  </P> <P> Tom Shepard, former Hedgecock strategist and criminal co-defendant, was an  adviser to both Hartley and Linda Bernhardt.  </P> <P> * There's no truth to the rumor that Hartley's first legislative proposal will  be to decriminalize the selling of lobsters from the back of flatbed trucks.  </P> <P> During the campaign, McColl branded Hartley as an outlaw because of his three  citations in the early 1980s for peddling edible crustaceans without a license.  Now, he's keeping them at arm's-length.  </P></p>

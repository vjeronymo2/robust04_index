			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Executive Cars (2): 'Isolation is not strength' / Charting a change of strategy among Europe's top manufacturers The joint venture announced earlier this year between Mercedes-Benz, the German luxury carmaker and SMH, the Swiss pioneer of cheap watches, to develop a micro compact car is a dramatic sign of the radical changes of strategy that are being embarked upon by Europe's executive carmakers. Mercedes-Benz, perhaps the world's leading producer of executive and luxury cars, is taking one of the most adventurous routes, as it maps out a future as a maker of a full range of cars from flagship limousines to two-seater micro city cars. BMW, its arch rival, has previously built its reputation on a fierce independence and a reluctance to enter alliances with any other automaker. In a departure from corporate tradition, just as stunning as that of Mercedes-Benz, it has moved recently to broaden substantially its industrial base with the takeover of Rover group from British Aerospace. Through the Pounds 800m acquisition of the leading UK vehicle maker it is doubling its production capacity and has become the foremost European maker of four-wheel drive sport/utility vehicles with Land Rover. It has acquired several new brand-names - most importantly Rover and MG as well as Land Rover - along with a position in the European market for small and medium-sized front-wheel drive cars, and a complex ready-made relationship with Honda, the Japanese carmaker. With the marketplace fragmenting, BMW has accepted that it must move into new segments to add to its niche of high-performance executive and luxury cars. It could have continued to go it alone and develop the necessary products itself, but that would have taken time and been much more expensive. Instead, it has chosen the riskier fast track of acquisition. It believes that with Rover it has also found a viable way of entering the small car market without diluting its own precious brand image. Rover is to be its centre for small car development. This will ensure BMW a presence in this marketplace but will not put at risk the BMW brand name, says Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, management board chairman. Volvo of Sweden, in the meantime, has been forced by rebellious shareholders and reluctant senior management to forsake the merger route as its chosen path towards future survival. Its alliance with Renault, the French state-owned carmaker, was so well-heralded that the final move to a complete merger had been taken for granted. Much to the discomfiture of Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, then Volvo chairman, the alliance failed late last year, when it became clear that leading Volvo shareholders would refuse to approve a merger. The new board's strategy is to develop Volvo into a 'streamlined' company. Non-core activities in food and pharmaceuticals are to be sold off to make the automotive operations 'financially stable'. Full-scale merger appears to have been ruled out by the Renault debacle but according to Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo president, specific co-operative ventures 'will be natural elements of our operations.' Despite the failure of the alliance, he says that it is still the case that 'in the automotive industry isolation is not strength.' Mr Gyll says that Volvo must 'intensify its efforts to find partners' in the areas in which it operates, not least because the process of renewing its product range 'must occur more rapidly than it has in the past'. Amid all this turmoil in Europe the most surprising change of direction has come from Mercedes-Benz, whose tradition had appeared to make it the least flexible of the world's leading prestige carmakers and the most unlikely candidate for re-thinking so radically the whole way it does business. Mercedes-Benz has embarked on a far- reaching re-alignment of its product strategy. It has decided to transform itself from 'a car manufacturer with a long tradition in the luxury class' into 'an exclusive full-line manufacturer offering high quality vehicles in all segments of the market.' With astonishing frankness, it has accepted the unpalatable truth that its luxury cars were 'over-engineered' and that if the company persisted with that policy in developing new models, it would end up being 'priced out' of world markets. Mercedes-Benz's new strategy means that by the late 1990s it will have launched a series of vehicles into new segments of the world market including: a multi-purpose vehicle, to rival models such as the Renault Espace, a modern four-wheel drive sport/utility vehicle that will be assembled in a new plant in the US, a small family car sized between a Volkswagen Golf and a Ford Fiesta, and a micro compact car, a two-seater for urban commuting, that it is developing in the joint venture with SMH, the Swatch watchmaker. Mr Helmut Werner, Mercedes-Benz chief executive, says of the so-called 'Swatchmobile': 'We intend to create a market segment which has hitherto not existed in this form yet provides substantial growth potential . . . The micro compact car is ideally suitable to re-define urban mobility.' The car is being conceived partly as a second or third car for traditional customers, but Mercedes-Benz also wants 'to appeal to new customer groups which were not open for us in the past'. In addition to the new product strategy Mercedes-Benz has embarked on a 'radical rethinking' of its production structure, says Mr Werner. It plans to increase the share of its car production outside Germany to 10 per cent in the medium term from only 2 per cent at present, with production growing in such countries as the US, Mexico, South Korea and India. It is cutting vertical integration - the level of in-house manufacturing - from 45 to under 40 per cent by 1998 by making greater use of outside components suppliers, and it is also ready to enter more co-operative ventures with other vehicle makers and suppliers. Mercedes passenger vehicle production is likely to jump to about 1m a year by the late 1990s with the addition of the new vehicle ranges, from 482,000 last year. Its car production peaked at 598,000 in 1987.</p>

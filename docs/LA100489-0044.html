			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPUBLICAN PRO-CHOICE CANDIDATE WINS SEAT IN 76TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT  </P> <P> Tricia Hunter, a Republican who bucked party leaders by taking a pro-choice  stand on abortion, Tuesday won a special state Assembly contest.  </P> <P> Hunter, a 37-year-old cardiac nurse from Bonita, was followed by GOP write-in  candidate Dick Lyles, who campaigned against abortion rights. Trailing far  behind were Democrat Jeannine Correia, also a pro-choice candidate, and a  second anti-abortion candidate, Republican Kirby Bowser.  </P> <P> The election fills the unexpired term of the late Bill Bradley (R-San Marcos)  in the 76th District, which includes parts of San Diego and Riverside counties.  </P> <P> The campaign's framework was constructed over the summer when the U.S. Supreme  Court gave states new authority to restrict abortions. With Hunter's pro-choice  position setting up a showdown between her and five anti-abortion Republicans,  the otherwise obscure race attracted nationwide attention as one of the first  tests of the political fallout from the court's July decision.  </P> <P> Hunter won the August primary with a scant 197-vote margin over Lyles, setting  up a runoff with Democrat Correia. Lyles, a 42-year-old Poway businessman,  immediately launched a write-in campaign.  </P> <P> With Republicans holding a 55%-32% registration edge, victory in the GOP  primary historically is tantamount to election in the district.  </P> <P> But Lyles' decision to continue his campaign created at least some uncertainty  about the outcome, raising concern among Republican leaders who feared that his  write-in candidacy could split the GOP vote.  </P> <P> Throughout the runoff, the campaign reflected an inherent irony: Hunter, who  owed her very presence to the abortion issue's ascendancy in the primary,  consistently sought to minimize its significance, terming it "only one of many  issues -- and not even one of the top ones -- people are concerned about."  Meanwhile, Lyles, who was victimized by the issue in August, fought to maintain  its pre-eminence in the runoff.  </P> <P> "In the time it takes you to vote, four babies will die from abortion," warned  a Lyles brochure that was distributed over the weekend.  </P> <P> A Hunter campaign mailer described Lyles as "the choice of the gun lobby,  anti-choice extremists and the Sacramento Cavemen," with the last phrase  referring to arch conservatives in the Republican Assembly caucus.  </P> <P> Correia, meanwhile, acknowledged that her admittedly slim chances hinged on a  divided GOP vote. A 46-year-old instructor of the developmentally disabled from  Poway, she often reminded audiences that, while she concurred with Hunter on  the pivotal abortion issue, the two differed on a wide range of social and  economic subjects.  </P> <P> Bowser, a 29-year-old Lakeside accountant, appeared from the outset to be  little more than a political footnote in the contest.  </P></p>

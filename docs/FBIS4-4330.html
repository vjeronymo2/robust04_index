			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, March 30 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the  United States agreed to push their plans to adopt a resolution  at the UN Security Council on the North Korean nuclear dispute.    The agreement came during a meeting Wednesday morning  between  South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher.    Han and Christopher decided they would retain the content of  the draft resolution worked out by the United States but tone  down the phrasing, informed sources said.    At the same time, they did not rule out the possibility of  going along with a statement by the council president as  demanded by China, the sources said. The two countries will  continue to seek a compromise with China, they added.    Talking to reporters after the meeting, Han said his  agreement with Christopher was not just a gesture to facilitate  negotiations with China. "We have actually agreed to push our  plans to adopt a resolution," Han said.    Prior to the meeting, Christopher had consulted with Foreign  Ministers Tsutomu Hata of Japan and Andrey Kozyrev of Russia on  adopting a resolution on North Korea. The foreign ministers are  still negotiating among themselves, the sources said.    "Be it a resolution or a council president statement, the  security council is expected to adopt it by Thursday," Han said.  He added, however, that the timing could be put off a little if  minor problems cropped up.    In either case, there would be a deadline for North Korea,  Han said, hinting that it would be around mid-May when the  International Atomic Energy Agency could resume inspections.    Han said that if the IAEA cannot undertake additional  inspections, the United States will forget about talks with  North Korea and enter directly into a phase where the Security  Council would impose sanctions.    Therefore, North Korea will have to respond to the  resolution  or the council president's statement, Han said.    Han also briefed Christopher on the results of South Korean  President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China and discussed possible  Chinese cooperation.    Han and Christopher discussed follow-up measures to the  Security Council resolution, as well as problems related to the  joint military exercise Team Spirit and a third round of  U.S.-North Korean high-level talks, the sources said.    Later Wednesday, Han met with Samuel Burger, deputy White  House aide for national security affairs, and they agreed to  continue maintaining close coordination and cooperation on the  North Korean nuclear row.    Han is scheduled to visit the United Nations in New York for  talks with Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and both  permanent and non-permanent members of the UN Security Council.</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Arts: Good value with 'January Sales' - Theatre The old art of revue has made a triumphant return to London's West End. Kit and the Widow's January Sales will remind anyone old enough to remember Pieces of Eight which starred Kenneth Williams and took off the old Tory slogan - Don't let Labour ruin it - in the late 1950s. As a two-man show, Kit and the Widow also owes a lot to the Flanders and Swann style of At the Drop of a Hat. And here is the highest compliment of all: January Sales does not fall far short of Beyond the Fringe, which was the last major revue to appear in the London theatre, and that was in 1961. By 'revue' I mean topical political, social and musical satire with a touch of camp and nostalgia. Beyond the Fringe was a breakthrough because it poked fun at the then conventional wisdom, But if you look back, it seems pretty self-satisfied and conservative: very British and very Oxbridge. January Sales has the same merits and defects. The political satire is relatively mild. It treats the present government with affectionate ridicule rather than contempt. There is a lot of undergraduate humour. One very Flanders and Swann song has the refrain 'Bottomley, Bottomley, Bottomley,' after the health secretary. Schoolboy jokes come in with the Church of England getting its vicars in a twist and 'minor canons going off all over the place' and science enters with a version of Noel Coward's old song as 'A Womb with a View', including the latest developments on designer babies. The sharpest political song again comes from Coward. Kit prances magnificently round the stage as Lady Thatcher cursing that she could have been so wrong about John Major - 'so bad about the boy'. The harshest political line comes in the course of a song about the new Germany: 'Stephen Sondheim - he may be Jewish, but his initials are great'. The only weak song in the show, unfortunately much applauded, attacked the French for wanting the Channel tunnel. No such harshness is applied to the British. The song about the Queen and her family is broadly on her side. John Major is never attacked directly and John Smith is never mentioned. Yet in a British kind of way the satire is effective. Poking fun at the government can be much more devastating than ranting and raving. Not everything is politics. January Sales has the best take-off of Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber - whose Sunset Boulevard is playing next door - that you are ever likely to see, bringing out the derivative nature of his music. Yet since Kit and the Widow seem to be such nice people, it is kindly rather than cruelly done. The revue is down to run for only three weeks. That is absurd. The Widow (Richard Sisson) is the thin one who plays the piano and is developing a good line in diffident jokes. The fat one is Kit Hesketh-Harvey who does most of the singing. Together they are a marvellous team. Vaudeville Theatre. (071) 836 9987</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE HOUSE THAT PIZZA BUILT;  </P> <P> DOMINO'S MANSION;  </P> <P> THOMAS MONAGHAN, GUNNAR BIRKERTS AND THE SPIRIT OF FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT BY GORDON  P. BUGBEE (SOUTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY PRESS: $40; 184 PP.; ILLUSTRATED;  0-9621045-0-7)  </P> <P> Thomas Monaghan is a postmodern American entrepreneur. Where the old-style  capitalist built railroads, made steel and dug for oil, the contemporary type  produces nothing durable. Ray Kroc's McDonald's is the best-known of the  postwar fortunes made from the new service economy. Fast food is more  profitable than steel and a lot cheaper to produce. Monaghan's Domino's Pizza  business grew from one store in Ypsilanti, Mich., run by him and his brother in  1960, to a vast pizza empire. Gordon Bugbee's "Domino's Mansions" describes the  chairman's self-conscious transformation from college dropout to a significant  patron of American architecture.  </P> <P> The story has been told at least once before. Monaghan and Robert Anderson  chronicled the company's history in "Pizza Tiger" (1986). Why another book?  Bugbee, described as a "Harvard-trained architect," has assembled a strange  mixture of fact and legend in this beautifully illustrated book. He struggles  to integrate the pizza baron's business success with his obsessive interest in  Frank Lloyd Wright. Monaghan has bought houses, furniture and drawings of the  architect. His new Ann Arbor corporate headquarters houses his collection in  what he calls The National Center for the Study of Frank Lloyd Wright at  Domino's Farms. But he is no ordinary collector. Monaghan has gone a few steps  further and, in effect, hired Wright as a posthumous collaborator for Domino's  ambitious building program.  </P> <P> Delivering pizza in fewer than 30 minutes was the corporation's great  conceptual breakthrough. Hiring Gunnar Birkerts, a competent modernist  architect, to adapt some of Wright's unbuilt projects, specifically the early  prairie-style McCormick House and his Golden Beacon, a 1950s tower on Chicago's  Gold Coast, made Domino's an oddball mixture of art patron and corporate  booster. Bugbee finds nothing unusual in any of this.  </P> <P> He humorlessly recalls the story of how Wright's Taliesin Fellowship was asked  to unearth the master's moribund plans for the Golden Beacon. Monaghan's grand  plans for Domino's Farms call for a tower rising above both the Michigan  flatlands and Birkert's low-slung Prairie-esque buildings. Bugbee's tone is  ever respectful: "Tailoring the Golden Beacon to the needs of Domino's Pizza  risked diluting the majesty of the concept. The company wanted a 30-story tower  instead of the original 50-plus. (The number 30 has canonical meaning to  Domino's Pizza; company policy insists that a pizza be delivered no longer than  30 minutes after the order is taken over the phone.)"  </P> <P> Bugbee's use of words like majesty and canonical is typical of the book's  overinflated rhetoric and a key to its essential dishonesty. Had this work been  presented as a pure exercise in vanity and self-promotion or just a catalogue  to Monaghan's remarkable cache of Wrightian objects it might have joined a long  list of glorified self-presentations from Andrew Carnegie's to Donald Trump's.  But Bugbee is involved in a serious confusion of motives.  </P> <P> In addition to mind-numbing portraits of Monaghan, Birkerts and a gaggle of  Domino corporate officers, he offers a condensed history of modern American  architecture. This is a confusion further encouraged in a foreword to the book  by Yale's celebrated architectural historian, Vincent Scully. He too joins the  uncritical celebration of the chairman's love of the automobile, the land and  all things American.  </P> <P> Domino's includes a working farm next to its Ann Arbor headquarters. Prof.  Scully volunteers his own imprimatur to establish at least a rhetorical link  between the Monaghan-Birkerts-Wright project and the more complex history of  modern architecture. Bugbee goes on at length to insinuate this project into a  list of acknowledged masterpieces that include Louis Sullivan's Guaranty  Building (1894), Eliel Saarinen's Tribune Tower proposal (1922), and Ludwig  Mies van der Rohe's Crown Hall (1952-56) on the campus of the Illinois  Institute of Technology.  </P> <P> Scully adds to the list, "When fully occupied by a number of going business  concerns, and accompanied by its complementary tower, the long, low-rise office  building between the superhighways will inevitably be read as a bold emblem of  Broadacre City itself and a glorification of Wright's beloved image of urban  decentralization along the automobile roads." Wright's Broadacre City was to be  a democratic experiment out in the country. It was not to be a city owned by  one man. In real admiration for their subject, Bugbee and Scully twist history  into an ornament for the top of Monaghan's tree. This kind of gassy promotion  makes you run for relief under the Golden Arches or to the soft kitsch of the  red-and-blue dominoes.  </P> <P> Monaghan should be encouraged in his quest for "quality" and "excellence." His  Domino's Farms complex is in the tradition of sterile campus corporate  headquarters pioneered by the General Motors' Technical Center (1951-57)  designed by the Saarinens with whom Birkerts apprenticed.  </P> <P> Bugbee misses the opportunity to question the assumptions that led Thomas  Monaghan to locate his business away from the city and in a 19th-Century  fantasy pastoral of cows and happy workers. One of the illustrations has this  caption: "The EBA Club is an upgraded cafeteria where all Domino's Pizza people  may feel at home. Once a month, all Domino's Pizza staff don the uniform of  pizza throwers as a gesture of solidarity with the franchises." It's this kind  of goofy stuff that makes this book entertaining. "Domino's Mansion" is neither  an objective history of Domino's nor American architecture, but more like a  pizza, a messy mixture of cheese, sauce and dough.  </P></p>

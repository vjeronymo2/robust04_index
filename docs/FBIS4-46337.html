			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rafiq al-Zayn in Nicosia] </F>   [Text] The question is no longer if Hizballah will  retaliate for the kidnapping of Mustafa al-Dirani, but how it  will retaliate. Information received by AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI a few  days after the Israeli operation indicates that a quick decision  was made at the highest levels between Beirut and Tehran,  following which a commando group was sent to Europe to carry out  a revenge operation that will grab media headlines and remind  Israel and the world that Hizballah's arm is long and able to  retaliate in kind against international terrorism.    Three days after the kidnapping of Mustafa al-Dirani, who  was  a prominent leader of the Believers Resistance, a report by a  major Western intelligence organization in Beirut noted that  Hizballah's threats are very serious this time, and its analysis  of these threats fit in with the movements on the ground, which  emphasize that preparations are under way for a powerful strike  in retaliation against this Israeli operation.    The report referred to the activation of a military plan  that  had been previously worked out to carry out an operation or a  series of operations against Israel.    The information stresses that the Hizballah leadership  decided to strike outside Lebanon. This decision was made  following protracted deliberations and after requesting an  Iranian green light, which was conveyed by a party's security  official dispatched to Tehran on Saturday morning, hours after  the kidnapping.    According to the information, the Hizballah  leadership--which  emphasized that it is expanding the area of confrontations in  Lebanon and that it will no longer adhere to restrictions on  resistance actions--ruled out the idea of carrying out the  violent retaliation for which it is preparing from the south for  several reasons: First, to avoid being accused of playing  Israel's game, which seeks to confuse the internal situation in  Lebanon and endanger peace through this operation.    Second, the party's leadership fears that the retaliatory  operations would ignite a confrontation between the party and  the Lebanese authorities, especially since the party has fears  of such confrontation to implement a plan to liquidate it.    The third reason is a regional one that has dangerous  dimensions. The party's leadership knows that igniting the  situation in south Lebanon continues to be a redline, especially  concerning the dangerous results it may have on the peace  process and the current negotiations. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI's  information emphasizes that a decision has been made by Bi'r  al-'Abd, in Beirut's southern suburb [Hizballah headquarters],  and Tehran to resort to an old-new style of powerful revenge  outside the country. This will protect Hizballah itself in  Lebanon, delay confrontation with the government, and offer a  goodwill gesture, and at the same time will issue a threat of  strong retaliation that will gain more international media  attention than a suicide operation in south Lebanon or by firing  Katyusha missiles at Israel.    The information adds that a plan has been worked out to  carry  out exciting and major operations against Israeli targets in a  West European country. It has been emphasized that the  retaliation should not be an assassination or booby-trapped car,  but it should be similar to what Israel did, that is to kidnap  ranking Israeli diplomats from embassies--an ambassador, consul,  or more--and detain them in a building or a crowded center in a  manner that incites media clamor and angers and forces  negotiations with the Israelis through the media.    Through this hostage-taking operation, Hizballah seeks quick  negotiations with the Israeli Government in which it will not  only demand the release of Mustafa al-Dirani, but all Lebanese  intellectuals in Israeli prisons, who currently number 350,  including Shaykh 'Abd-al-Karim 'Ubayd, who was abducted by  Israel from his house in the south in 1989.    Special security sources say that 'Imad Mughniyah, Hizballah  security officer who currently lives in Tehran and carries an  Iranian passport, played an important role in preparing for the  operation and training of the commando group that will carry out  the operation. Earlier, Mughniyah held intensive contacts and  meetings in Tehran in the presence of Intelligence Minister 'Ali  Fallahian, Revolutionary Guard Chief Mohsen Reza'i, and the  supervisor of the "al-Quds Battalion," which is specialized in  overseas operations. It is known that 'Imad Mughniyah is one of  al-Dirani's closest friends. They, together with Husayn  al-Musawi, were responsible for taking Western hostages in  Lebanon in the eighties.    According to the available information, a four-man Hizballah  commando group has arrived in Germany to carry out the operation  as soon as possible. Germany has been selected because of the  existence of the headquarters of the Iranian terrorist network  in this country, where Iranian terrorist groups move freely  thanks to the close relations of cooperation between Bonn and  Tehran. Taking advantage of these relations, Hizballah formed  and organized its networks in this country and a number of  neighboring countries. Hizballah maintains an important  logistics base in Germany in cooperation with Revolutionary  Guard elements. It seems that Tehran has given the green light  for the implementation of the operation in Germany despite its  relations with it. Besides avenging al-Dirani, Iran wants to  pressure the Bonn government to keep it from going too far in  the current trial of perpetrators of the Mykonos restaurant [in  Berlin] crime, in which four Iranian Party of Kurdistan members  were killed. Tehran attaches great importance to this trial  since the suspects are Revolutionary Guard and Lebanese  Hizballah members. Convicting them would threaten to officially  prove for the first time that Iran has a role in international  terror.    It has been learned that Tehran has offered all means of  support to the Hizballah group to carry out the operation.  However, it has set the condition that the operation should  take place in the name of Hizballah only, and that not a single  Iranian thread should appear in it. Actually, the Hizballah  cells in Germany and Europe have for days been preparing and  planning for the operation in order to carry it out  successfully. They are also considering the possibility of  carrying out similar operations in any other country, should a  chance become available. Therefore, the Hizballah networks in  Europe held contacts with fundamentalist Islamic groups in other  countries to help them secure logistical support. They also  asked radical Palestinian groups that are known to have a  presence in more than one capital to contribute to taking  revenge on Israel. According to the latest information, when  these lines were written last weekend, the Hizballah networks  had not received clear answers from its "Islamic fundamentalist"  partners, who, despite their enthusiastic response to the idea,  asked for some time to consult with their leaders and to do  their own calculations, especially since they for a while have  been under strict security surveillance in their own locations,  restricting their movements.    However, Western security authorities well acquainted with  the alliances of radical fundamentalist movements and  international terrorist organizations of various orientations  and nationalities do not rule out the involvement of a radical  Palestinian group in the Hizballah revenge plan, since this plan  is in line with this group's calculations and the international  terrorist plan it has been preparing for months, after it  redeployed its cells in Europe, specifically in Germany.    Will the alert and precautionary measures taken by the Mosad  in Israeli embassies and the intensive exchange of information  between most major Western intelligence services be successful?  Or will Hizballah manage to avenge itself and prove to the  world that its arm is long, just like Israel's?</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt The Bund market faces a nervous fortnight. This week and next traders will be overwhelmed with statistics on the German economy. They include new orders, unemployment, industrial production and the GDP figure for the third quarter. On Thursday, the Bundesbank policy-making council holds its penultimate meeting of the year. The market has priced in a further generous cut in the discount this year - but will it come? Latest inflation data, released last Friday, was good - an annual 3.7 per cent. This was the fourth month in a row growth had slowed. As Mr Johann Gaddum, Bundesbank vice-president, hinted last Thursday, this may mean Germany is over the hump on inflation, pointing to further easing of monetary policy. Working against this last week were hard-line speeches from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, and the fact that the fixed-rate repo, at 6.25 per cent, down four basis points on the previous week, apparently pointed to a more restrained pace of cuts. Growth in October M3 money supply was higher than expected. If the Bundesbank delivers no cut, the Bund market will have to focus all its hopes on the one remaining council meeting, scheduled for December 16. This may lead to nervousness in the long end. There may still be nervousness if the Bundesbank does deliver cuts.</p>

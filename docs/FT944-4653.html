			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Rolls-Royce on course to conclude Mercedes deal Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the Vickers-owned luxury car maker, expects to meet its target of concluding an engine supply deal with Mercedes-Benz of Germany before the end of this year. Mercedes will supply its 6 litre V12 engine and possibly some other components to Rolls-Royce under an agreement now in the final stages of negotiation. 'We can't say yet that a deal has been concluded and we have made no plans for an announcement this week,' Rolls-Royce said. 'However, talks are at a very advanced stage.' The company, based in Crewe, Cheshire, has been negotiating with Mercedes for nearly a year, although it has never formally identified the Stuttgart concern as the potential supplier of the engine to replace Rolls' own 6.75 litre units. The current engines used in Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars are derived from a Crewe-produced unit launched by the company in 1958 and updated substantially. The Mercedes engine, launched in 1991, is currently produced at a rate of only 8,500 units a year. The potential extra output of more than 1,500, which could arise from supplying Rolls-Royce, could improve economies of scale substantially.</p>

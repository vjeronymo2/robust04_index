			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Bonn proposes new recycling measure THE German cabinet yesterday approved a proposed environmental law which will force industrial producers to ensure the collection and recycling of waste consumer products. The law, which will be presented to parliament this year, should come into effect in about three years and will effectively transfer to the private sector the costs of collecting and recycling waste now assumed by local councils. The Environment Ministry said: 'Our philosophy aims to make industry, and not the state, pay for recycling consumer products.' However, consumers may be the first to bear the cost of the recycling. Industrialists, who have opposed the law fiercely, say it will force companies to charge higher prices. 'It is time to understand that there simply is a price to be paid for recycling,' Mr Klaus Topfer, environment minister said yesterday. A similar law for consumer packaging, adopted two years ago, prompted industrial producers to create a nationwide waste-collecting company, Duales System Deutschland (DSD). Consumers have been charged higher prices for products collected by DSD, which bear a distinctive green dot. Such a system may also be set up as a result of the new law, with producers creating a special organisation in charge of collecting consumer products and ensuring their recycling. Products sold in Germany by foreign companies could also be collected. The Environment Ministry hopes industry will ultimately be forced to manufacture products which can be more easily recycled. The new law will also restrict industry's opportunity to dump or incinerate waste.</p>

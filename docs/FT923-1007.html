			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Industry plea on science THE US should allocate at least Dollars 1bn-Dollars 2bn to help industry adapt for commercial use advances made in the Dollars 22bn federal laboratory system, according to a report by the private sector Council on Competitiveness. 'The superb array of expensive facilities, equipment and instruments' of the government laboratories, as well as their scientists and researchers, could be 'intensively utilised by and for the private sector,' said Mr Erich Bloch, former director of the National Science Foundation. He presented the report yesterday to the House committee on science, space and technology. The laboratory system is a microcosm of the broader US competitiveness problem, he said. It is still geared to the Cold War, rather than the current era of intense international economic competition. 'The federal government should launch national technology infra-structural projects that strengthen US industrial competitiveness and foster co-operation among industry, universities and the federal labs,' he said.</p>

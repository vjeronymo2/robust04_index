			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: FII launches bid for shoe rival C&amp;J Clark SHARES IN FII were suspended at 488p yesterday as Britain's second largest shoe manufacturer announced it was in takeover talks with a company identified as its private UK rival, C&amp;J Clark. The quoted company, with a market value of about Pounds 70m, is believed to have tabled an offer comprising cash or shares valuing Clark at between Pounds 100m and Pounds 150m. FII, which claims about 6 per cent of the UK shoe manufacturing market and is a major supplier to Marks and Spencer, has been interested in a deal with the family-held company for some five years. If its bid succeeds, FII is expected to retain Clark's retailing operation - K Shoes and Ravel. Meanwhile, Berisford dampened speculation that it was a front runner in the bidding for Clark. The property and commodities company said it was exploring the possibility of an offer and no final decision had been taken. A minority group of Clark's board members, who sought to unseat the chairman last year, are almost certain to oppose a sale unless the price is at least 200p a share, or Pounds 154m. They are believed to be unwilling to see the company - which is 70 per cent held by more than 500 Clark family members - pass out of family control.</p>

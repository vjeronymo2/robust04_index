			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / Nato air strike halts Serb shelling: US jets attack to protect embattled Bosnian enclave - Clinton warns of tough resolve Nato aircraft attacked Serb forces advancing on the Moslem enclave of Gorazde last night, the first time the alliance has acted on its long-standing threat to use air power to protect Bosnian towns. The United Nations said the air strike, aimed at an artillery command post, succeeded in stopping the Serb shelling. But President Bill Clinton quickly warned that Washington would support further air attacks on Serb positions if requested by UN military commanders in Bosnia. He said the raid by two US F-16 fighter bombers, based at Aviano in Italy, was a clear signal of UN and US resolve. He urged the Serbs to roll back their two-week-old offensive on Gorazde, one of three 'safe areas' for Moslems in eastern Bosnia. At least 100 people have been killed and 400 wounded in the fighting around the enclave. General Sir Michael Rose, the head of UN forces in Bosnia, said he had called for the raid after a tank began firing into the centre of the town. He said the shelling stopped 18 minutes after the aircraft dived out of a rain cloud to drop their bombs. According to Mr Michael Williams, the UN's chief spokesman in former Yugoslavia, the action was taken under Security Council resolution 836, which 'allows for the use of air power, in and around the safe areas, to support Unprofor (the UN protection force) in the performance of its mandate'. He added that UN military observers and humanitarian personnel, as well as Bosnian civilians, were at direct risk from the shelling, and that the Bosnian Serb leadership had been warned of this yesterday afternoon. He said General Bertrand de Lapresle, head of UN forces in former Yugoslavia, hoped to meet the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, and Bosnian Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic today. 'We would hope that the peace process is not seriously impaired,' Mr Williams said. However, Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian prime minister, said the Moslems would not join the talks unless the Serbs retreated to the positions they occupied before the battle over Gorazde. General Milan Gvero, deputy commander of the Bosnian Serb armed forces, accused Nato of bombing civilian targets, and described the strikes as 'an attack on Serbian civilisation', but did not threaten reprisals against Nato or the UN. However, the Nato action raises the possibility of a dispute with Russia, where the Serb cause is strongly supported. According to the Yugoslav news agency, the Serb army's Hercegovina Corps warned: 'By this act, Nato carried out a clear act of aggression against Serb people, striking at civilian targets far from the front line.' Gen Rose has struggled unsuccessfully in recent days to arrange a ceasefire in Gorazde in preparation for a longer-term truce. The Nato operation followed reports of heavy artillery and small-arms fire reaching as far as the centre of the enclave, home to 65,000 Moslems. Mr Kris Janowski, a spokesman for the UN High Commission for Refugees, said shortly before the air attack that thousands of desperate villagers were pouring into Gorazde amid a heavy artillery barrage. 'People can see villages around Gorazde burning and there is constant fire from howitzers in and around the centre.' He added that the UNHCR building had come under small-arms fire and people had been targeted by snipers. The US involvement marks a turning point in the conflict. In recent days, Pentagon officials had questioned whether air strikes would be effective in ending the conflict over Gorazde, and played down the scale of the fighting. However, the administration came under pressure to act as the UN reported an intensification of the Serb assault and warned that the townspeople were increasingly desperate. Gen Rose told Reuter news agency he had warned Serb commanders three times in telephone and fax messages they would be bloodied if they continued advancing on Gorazde. 'We warned them very firmly that if this continues we would have to resort to appropriate action and they knew exactly what we meant,' he said. The UNHCR, concerned about reprisals against its staff, said it would suspend aid convoys through Serb-controlled territory. Air onslaught risks alienating Russia, Page 3</p>

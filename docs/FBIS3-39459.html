This is shown by the RTL "Chancellor's  Barometer," which was presented on Thursday [17 February].  According to this poll, Kohl's popularity rose by 1 percent to  26 percent compared with the previous week. The head of  government, however, is still 9 percent behind Scharping (35  percent), who lost 2 percent.    According to the poll, 31 percent of the voters would vote  for the CDU/CSU, which is 1 percent more than last week. The  SPD, on the other hand, would lose 2 percent, but would still  have the support of 44 percent of the voters. With 6 percent of  the votes, the Free Democratic Party of Germany would exceed 5  percent for the first time in weeks. The figures of Alliance  90/Greens (10 percent), as well as the Party of Democratic  Socialism and the Republikaner (3 percent each), have remained  unchanged.    For this poll, the Forsa Institute questioned 2,514 German  citizens on behalf of the RTL morning program "Good Morning,  Germany."</p>

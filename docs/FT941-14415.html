			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Daf nets Fl 10m in 10 months Daf Trucks, the Dutch truck maker rescued from financial collapse last year, made a net profit of Fl 10m (Dollars 5m) in the 10 months from March to December. The company is still majority-owned by the Dutch and Flemish governments, but it is expected that the combined state holding will be reduced to a minority position later this year. Mr Cor Baan, chairman of the Daf Trucks management board, said the company had achieved a turnover of Fl 1.3bn in the final 10 months of last year. He forecast further growth in turnover and profit this year, despite continued weakness in the European truck market. The company has begun negotiations with the Dutch unions to increase the flexibility of its labour agreements. It is seeking to increase the working week to 38 hours from the present 36. It is also seeking to introduce a new shift system with a 9 1/2 -hour day, four days a week with the possibility of the plant working 6 days a week.</p>

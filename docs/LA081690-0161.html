			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MOUNTAIN VIEW;  </P> <P> SANTA CLARA COUNTY ENDING MEDFLY WAR  </P> <P> Santa Clara County is moving into the final stage of its yearlong fight against  an infestation of Mediterranean fruit flies. The last of nearly 800 million  sterile Medflies were released from the Mountain View area last Friday, and  about 1,200 new traps have been hung throughout the 65-square-mile quarantine  area. If no fertile Medflies are trapped in the next few weeks, the quarantine  that has blocked the shipment of fruits and vegetables from the area could be  lifted by mid-September, said Greg Van Wassenhove, the county's agricultural  commissioner.  </P></p>

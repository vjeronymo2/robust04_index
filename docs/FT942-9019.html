			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Chancellor denies rift with Bank over policy Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, last night sought to quash suggestions that he and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, differed on policy, asserting that they 'share the same aim of low inflation and sound money'. Stressing his belief in a 'business-friendly government', Mr Clarke said he would continue to set fiscal and monetary policy 'as toughly and decisively as I have to' with the aim of 'low inflation on a permanent basis and healthy public finances'. In an address to the annual dinner of the Confederation of British Industry, the chancellor admitted that the government had a political problem because the UK economy was recovering 'without a feel-good factor'. But, using words that echoed those of Mr George in a speech last week, he said: 'Too many people still hanker after the go-go growth of living standards they enjoyed in the years of boom. Well, this chancellor does not want a boom because boom gets followed by bust.' In a move to counter reports of differences with the governor over interest rates and Mr George's hawkish anti-inflation stance, Mr Clarke said he remained firmly committed to the government's policy of keeping underlying inflation in the 1 per cent to 4 per cent band and bringing it within the lower part of the band by the end of this parliament. He had, he said, allowed the Bank to publish its own quarterly inflation report and insisted on the publication of genuine minutes of his monthly monetary meetings with Mr George to improve the credibility of policy. 'There is not a clash between cultures or objectives.' Stories of differences with Mr George were 'a little coloured'. The new openness in government was 'heady stuff for journalists to handle - it is like introducing Red Indians to whisky'. Britain's current low inflation level had been hard won and 'the governor and I are equally determined that it should not be jeopardised by any lack of monetary discipline in the upturn,' Mr Clarke said. The government remained 'absolutely resolute' in its determination to control public spending and cut public borrowing, he added. Tax cutting would come on to the agenda again, he said, but only after 'the other things' had been put right. Mr Clarke made a vigorous defence of his private finance initiative, claiming that the effort to involve the private sector in areas such as infrastructure spending could have as important an impact in the 1990s as privatisation had done in the 1980s. He also said the UK should not lose self-confidence over Europe, claiming that Britain's improved economic performance could win influence and help the government in its aim of creating a European Union that is good for UK industry and enterprise.

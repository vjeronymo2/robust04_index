			<p>BFN     [Text] Fukuoka, June 11 KYODO -- The computer microchip  industry in Kyushu, known as Japan's Silicon Valley, is  regaining vitality on the strength of brisk exports, Trade  Ministry officials said Saturday [11 June].    According to the Kyushu Regional Bureau of International  Trade and Industry, total production of integrated circuits  (ICs) in the Kyushu region in April hit a record high of about  670.6 million chips.    April marked the 15th consecutive month of year-to-year  rises, said the regional bureau of the Ministry of International  Trade and Industry (MITI).    An official of major microchip manufacturer Oki Electric  Industry Co.'s semiconductor factory in Miyazaki Prefecture said  the record- breaking output reflects "strong exports to the  United States due to robust demand for personal computers there."    "A great number of microchip makers are building new  facilities to boost production capacities," he said.    In 1992, ic output in Kyushu plunged 11 percent from the  year  before to 6.36 billion chips.    Production began to show signs of picking up early this  year.  In February, the first year-on-year rise in about two years was  seen.    IC production surged to 668,637,000 chips the following  month, the highest level since the 670 million scored in  September 1993.</p>

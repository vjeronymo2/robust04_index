			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTESTERS VANDALIZE 2 CATHOLIC FACILITIES  </P> <P> In a graphic protest against the Roman Catholic clergy's position on abortion  and AIDS, vandals struck the headquarters of the Los Angeles Archdiocese and a  Torrance church Sunday, leaving behind graffiti, red coat hangers, a wooden  cross festooned with condoms and a mattress apparently stuffed with animal  entrails.  </P> <P> Police had no suspects, but in a telephone call to United Press International,  a group calling itself Artists Against Religious Oppression claimed  responsibility for what it called the "artwork" that was left just before dawn  at St. Catherine Laboure Roman Catholic Church in Torrance and at an  archdiocese office building just west of downtown where Archbishop Roger M.  Mahony works.  </P> <P> "The message is that the church should stay out of politics and medicine; that  it should stop its oppression of women, gays and lesbians; that it should stop  preaching sin and lies and that it should start preaching safe sex and the  truth," an unidentified spokeswoman for the group told UPI.  </P> <P> Archdiocese spokesman Rev. Gregory Coiro called the protest the work of  "extremists" who undermine "the serious public policy debate" over the church's  stance against abortion and the use of condoms as a means to prevent the spread  of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.  </P> <P> "This type of activity really is an assault against the First Amendment," Coiro  said. "It's an assault on freedom of speech. It's an assault on freedom of  religion."  </P> <P> In front of the archdiocese building at 1531 W. 9th Street, the vandals propped  up a brown mattress stuffed with red coat hangers, in apparent reference to the  era of back-room abortions; animal entrails, and what appeared to be an  animal's skin, according to witnesses. "Mahony murders women" was painted on  the mattress in white.  </P> <P> At St. Catherine Laboure Church on Redondo Beach Boulevard, police said a  10-foot-tall wooden cross was bolted to the door. The cross was covered with  about 30 fake penises -- police described them as "marital aids" -- covered  with condoms. Red coat hangers were strewn about the sidewalk, where the  vandals spray-painted the words "Safe sex saves. Mahony kills."  </P> <P> Sunday's attack was not the first time that local Roman Catholic clergy and  churches have been targeted by vandals.  </P> <P> In December, four Los Angeles churches were spattered with red paint by  demonstrators who denounced Mahony as a "murderer" for his view that chastity,  rather than the use of condoms, is the only morally correct way to stop AIDS.  Unnamed gay activists claimed responsibility.  </P> <P> A church in Silver Lake has been vandalized five times this year.  </P> <P> Parishioners at St. Catherine Laboure said Sunday's attack was not the first at  their church. During the last several months, they said, a concrete statue of  their patron saint has been destroyed, the exterior of the church has been  bombarded with Christmas ornaments filled with red paint and the rectory has  received threatening telephone calls.  </P> <P> The pastor of the church declined to comment on Sunday's incident and  parishioners said it was not discussed during Mass. Church officials, who had  been notified by police at about 5:30 a.m. that the attack had occurred,  removed the cross and covered up the sidewalk graffiti with door mats long  before services began. So it was not until reporters arrived that parishioners  learned that their church had been hit again.  </P> <P> Parishioners said they believe their church has been singled out because some  of its members are active in Operation Rescue, a vocal anti-abortion group, and  because they provide support to a nearby maternity clinic that counsels women  on alternatives to abortion. They said they were hurt, angered and saddened by  the vandalism.  </P> <P> "It's terrible," said Alice Aguirre. "It's a church and they have no respect  for it."  </P> <P> Said Clay Watson, who has attended St. Catherine Laboure since 1947, "This is  our life. When they hit the church, they hit us."  </P></p>

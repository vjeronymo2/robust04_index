			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Hewetson improves in second half A recovery in the normally more difficult second half enabled Hewetson, the flooring and building materials company, to limit the fall in annual profits to 19 per cent. The company added that the present year had started better with sales at higher levels and larger forward order books. On turnover up from Pounds 28.6m to Pounds 31.2m, including Pounds 1.58m from an acquisition, pre-tax profits were Pounds 407,000 (Pounds 503,000). Earnings per share were 0.38p (1.36p), but an unchanged final dividend of 0.75p is recommended for a maintained total of 1.25p. Hewetson said the results reflected difficult trading conditions during the early part of the year.</p>

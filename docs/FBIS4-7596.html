			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enes Musovic] </F>   [Text] According to the reconnaissance-intelligence reports  of the special units of the East Bosnian Operations Group of the  Army of Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Gorazde Ministry  of Internal Affairs, the Serbo-chetnik aggressor is going to  launch one of the fiercest attacks on Gorazde today. The attack  is expected from the direction of Foca and (?Prata).    Yesterday and overnight, the aggressor brought in 30 more  armored vehicles along with well-armed and fresh troops  consisting of members of the Herzegovina Corps, local chetniks,  and Russian and Romanian mercenaries.    Meanwhile, the Serbo-chetnik aggressor is continuing the  intensive artillery and infantry attacks on the defense lines of  the Gorazde defenders and civilian targets in this area. The  courageous fighters of our army last night repelled a strong  attack on Popovaca by drugged murderers. The attack lasted more  than two hours. In this fierce fighting, the chetniks suffered  major losses. One defender of Gorazde was slightly wounded.    This morning, the chetniks carried out one of the fiercest  artillery-infantry attacks on Lastan, the 13th attack since the  beginning of the offensive on Gorazde. Even though every single  inch of territory in this region is literally being turned over  by the destructive power of high-caliber projectiles, the  fighters of Lastan and all other defense lines are saying that  the ideas of war criminal [Radovan] Karadzic will never  materialize in this region and that this region will always  remain free    This is Enes Musovic reporting for Bosnia-Herzegovina radio  and television from the the Gorazde region press center.</p>

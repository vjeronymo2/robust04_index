			<p>BFN     [Text] The scheduled visit to the United States by the  director general of the Defense Agency [DA] has been canceled.  DA officials are concerned over the possible influence of his  cancellation on Japanese relations with the United States  because Kanda was originally scheduled to hold talks with  Secretary of Defense Perry prior to the May expiration date for  responses to the UN Security Council chairman's statement on  measures to deal with the suspected nuclear arms development by  the DPRK (North Korea). The Security Consultative Council will  hold its meeting at the bureau-chief level as scheduled.  However, it has been said within the DA that "the United States  may doubt Japan's approach towards crisis management."    If former DA Director-General Kazuo Aichi had been  reappointed, it was originally planned that he would visit the  United States beginning 1 May. However, immediately following  the replacement of Aichi by Atsushi Kanda of the Democratic  Socialist Party after the new cabinet was formed on 28 April, it  was decided the visit should be postponed since "few results  would be achieved due to insufficient preparations." According  to a DA source: "Kanda did not insist on paying a visit to the  United States."    The original plan for the DA leader's visit did not include  discussions only on measures to deal with the North Korean  issue. The visit was also aimed at "somehow or other improving  Japan-U.S. relations which have become rather stiff as a result  of economic and trade friction, appealing to the fact the two  nations still maintain a honeymoon relationship in security."  As far as the Hata administration is concerned, it would have  been the first visit to the United States by a cabinet member of  the minority-ruled administration.    Director General Kanda states: "I will give positive  consideration to the visit if there should be any changes in  North Korea." There is a growing hope within the Agency "that  his visit to the United States will take place in June."  However, when the long consecutive holidays come to an end, the  cabinet will be busily engaged in deliberations over the draft  budget bill for fiscal 1994. Since the future prospects for the  cabinet remain cloudy, it seems most likely those concerned will  have to share continuous concerns over this country's relations  with the United States.</p>

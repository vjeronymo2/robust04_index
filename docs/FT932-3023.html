			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Rothschild Bank provisions rise ROTHSCHILD Bank, the troubled Zurich affiliate of NM Rothschild of London, has made provisions of SFr270.9m (Pounds 122m) against bad loans in the past two years, substantially more than previously estimated. Mr Guy Wais, general manager, said yesterday that an investigation by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants, following the discovery of lending irregularities early last year led to the increase in provisions from the previously stated figure of about SFr220m. Most of the lending was to the collapsed York Hannover and Castor property groups, and it infringed Swiss law restricting the amount a bank can lend to a single client. The bank has maintained that the lending was arranged by its former credit manager, Mr Jurg Heer, and that he concealed the details from other bank directors. It has accused Mr Heer, who has admitted receiving commissions of some SFr30m on the lending, of fraud and other offences. Mr Heer has since fled Switzerland and an international warrant has been issued for his arrest. The Swiss Federal Banking Commission and the Swiss Bankers Association are investigating the apparent failures of the bank's internal and external control systems. But Mr Wais said yesterday that financially 'Heer's file' was now closed. The bank's 1992-93 annual report reveals changes in its financial structure. Total assets halved from SFr1.34bn at March 31, 1992 to SFr622.4m a year later. Mr Wais said this reflected a deliberate running down of its lending book in addition to the write-offs. Shareholder's equity has risen from SFr198.7m to SFr206.1m, reflecting an injection by a Rothschild family company of SFr120.5m in new capital. This was achieved by its purchase of a part of the bad loans at face value. The injection also made it possible for the bank to show a net income last year of SFr12.8m compared with SFr24.5m the previous year. The annual dividend was cut from SFr10m to SFr5.5m. Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, chairman, said operating profits, which were down only SFr2.5m to SFr57.1m, were 'good' and the balance sheet was 'extremely sound'. The board was confident 'all necessary and prudent safeguards' were in place. Swiss scandal, Page 26</p>

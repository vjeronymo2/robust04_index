			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Firebombs in MetroCentre SIX incendiary devices ignited early today in the Gateshead MetroCentre, Europe's largest shopping complex. Three others were found and made safe by bomb disposal officers. The police said the fires had caused minimal damage to stores and that no one had been hurt. 'These were professional devices,' Mr David Mellish, assistant chief constable for Northumbria. 'They would have caused serious fire damage and could have resulted in serious loss of life had they gone off this afternoon when the centre was crowded.' The centre was evacuated when two firebombs were discovered, and fires caused by other devices broke out as police were searching premises. No warnings were given, and police were unable to say when the devices were planted or who was responsible. The incendiaries, which contained timing devices, were thought to be similar to devices planted in shopping centres at Blackpool, Manchester and north London in December.</p>

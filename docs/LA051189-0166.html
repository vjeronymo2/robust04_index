			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUITS FORCE MOUNTAIN GEAR FIRM TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY  </P> <P> While Yvon Chouinard may be best known for founding Patagonia, the  Ventura-based distributor of outdoor clothing, the seeds of his $70-million  empire were in the functional climbing gear he first fashioned in the early  1960s in a metalworking shed in his parents' back yard.  </P> <P> Chouinard Equipment Ltd. posted only $6 million in sales last year. But it was  the industry leader, buoyed by the reputations of its high-performance gear and  its high-profile founder, who has spent months at a time climbing treacherous  ice in Antarctica or scaling Himalayan peaks without taking oxygen.  </P> <P> So industry observers were surprised last month when the firm announced that it  was filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  </P> <P> Company officials claimed that the firm's finances were sound but said that  pending lawsuits and the rising cost of liability insurance prompted the move.  </P> <P> "I've taken a lot of pride in making the world's best climbing equipment and  trying to do a good job at it, but times have changed," Chouinard said this  week. "Nobody wants to take responsibility for their actions, to say, 'I  screwed up, it's my fault, I didn't bother to learn how to use the gear.' "  </P> <P> Company officials said that four lawsuits blame Chouinard for injuries  allegedly caused by inadequate instructions and warnings on climbing harnesses  and other equipment.  </P> <P> Chouinard denies the allegations. Officials of Lost Arrow, the umbrella firm  that runs Patagonia, Chouinard Equipment and several other companies, declined  to identify the plaintiffs, or to say where or when the suits had been filed.  </P> <P> "No equipment failed and no equipment broke, but when people get hurt . . .  they sue," said Kevin Sweeney, a Lost Arrow spokesman.  </P> <P> Chouinard said that none of the lawsuits were filed by experienced climbers.  They were filed by beginners in climbing school, a window washer and an actor  who used the equipment on stage, he said.  </P> <P> Lost Arrow officials, who donate 10% of pretax profits to climbing and  environmental causes, said they aren't trying to evade their responsibilities  or liabilities. They said they are trying to ensure the company's survival.  </P> <P> They want to sever ties with Chouinard Equipment because they fear that Lost  Arrow's $70 million in assets could be attached if a lawsuit against the  mountaineering subsidiary succeeds.  </P> <P> As a result, Lost Arrow is trying to sell Chouinard Equipment. Lost Arrow  officials hope Chouinard's 70 employees will be able to raise the money to buy  the company themselves.  </P> <P> "It definitely sets a precedent in the industry," said George Bracksieck,  editor of Rock and Ice, a climbing magazine based in Boulder, Colo. "People  have sued over equipment failure before, but this is the first time one of the  major manufacturers of equipment has taken Chapter 11 because of suits."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 300 Trips Dropped  </P> <P> The increasing number of lawsuits and rising liability insurance costs already  have put mountaineers between a rock and a hard place. Last October, liability  concerns prompted the Sierra Club to drop all club-sponsored climbing trips  requiring ropes or ice axes.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Sierra Club chapter has dismantled part of its popular  mountaineering training course and dropped 300 mountaineering trips from its  extensive program of outings.  </P> <P> Some outdoor equipment business people fear that manufacturers and consumers  stand to lose if the suits against Chouinard succeed.  </P> <P> "It would have a chilling effect on the climbing industry," said Michael  Kennedy, editor of Climbing, a magazine based in Carbondale, Colo. "The  equipment won't be as good, and people won't have the money to do testing and  development. You'll end up with a lot of smaller, fly-by-night companies."  </P> <P> Throughout the industry, climbing aficionados and business people say that  while more people are climbing today than ever before, mountaineering remains a  high-risk sport with inherent dangers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Firms  </P> <P> "You can have the best equipment, but if you're high off the ground and make an  error, you can get killed pretty easily, and I think that needs to be  emphasized," Kennedy said.  </P> <P> Chouinard is one of only a few firms to file for Chapter 11 in the wake of  pending lawsuits. Johns Manville, which manufactured asbestos, and A. H.  Robins, which made the Dalkon shield, an intrauterine device that caused severe  medical problems for some women, filed for reorganization in two  well-publicized cases.  </P> <P> Legal experts said Chouinard might be making a smart move.  </P> <P> "Filing Chapter 11 is not something that is socially reprehensible," said  Kenneth N. Klee, a UCLA law school professor who helped draft the U.S.  Bankruptcy Code. "They could be doing two socially progressive things: Keeping  the business intact while they find out if they are liable and keeping their  employees in jobs while they litigate this issue."  </P> <P> 'Genuine Problem'  </P> <P> "They're being pretty straightforward," agreed Chris Hughes, editor of  Specialty News, a Bend, Ore., trade newsletter for the outdoor industry. "It's  a genuine problem for the whole outdoor industry."  </P> <P> Lost Arrow officials hope that the sale of Chouinard to its employees or  another owner might help to discourage further lawsuits and reduce liability  insurance costs.  </P> <P> They added that Lost Arrow would retain responsibility for lawsuits filed  against products sold before the ownership transfer.  </P> <P> In any case, many who are familiar with Chouinard said the filing signifies the  end of an era.  </P> <P> Said Sweeney: "The company's roots were in hardware gear and to sever those  roots does cause sadness around here."  </P></p>

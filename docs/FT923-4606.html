			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Dissident seeks to take control of Andrews Sykes DIRECTORS of Andrews Sykes, the industrial services and environmental products group which changed its name from Braithwaite last year, face a battle for control of the company with a dissident shareholder. Sykes said yesterday that Mr Jacques Murray, who holds a 26.63 per cent stake in the group, had called for an extraordinary general meeting. Mr Murray is also chairman of Nu-Swift, and majority shareholder in the office cleaning and fire protection group. The meeting, which will probably be held in late October, will be asked to consider resolutions for the removal of Mr David Hubbard, chairman, and Mr David Crowe, a non-executive director, from the 5-man board and replacing them with Mr Murray and three of his associates. Mr Hubbard said yesterday that he would resist moves by 'a minority shareholder to grab control of the company' without making a full bid. The directors said they would be recommending shareholders to vote against the resolutions. In their opinion and that of the company's advisers the mover 'would be neither desirable for the company nor in the best interests of other shareholders.' The company's shares closed up 5p at 130p yesterday. For the year to March 1992 Sykes returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.2m from a turnover of Pounds 56.8m.</p>

The Russian defense minister also told the Russian  television  program Itogi that he talked for an hour on phone with his U.S.  Counterpart William Perry after a meeting of defense ministers  from the U.S., Britain, France and the Netherlands.    "Fortunately, they listened to Russia," he said, adding he  understood from the conversation that although the defense  ministers hadn't made the last decision to deal with the  situation after the midnight Sunday deadline, his impression was  that there would be no immediate first-round air strike Monday.    The ministers would resume their meeting Monday to look into  the progress of heavy weapon withdrawal and the remaining  arsenals that the Serb side had failed to pull out because of  the heavy snowfalls, Grachev said.    Meanwhile, he said, about 400 Russian peacekeepers had  arrived in the Bosnia capital and would be deployed there.    The Russian deployment was part of an agreement with the  Bosnian Serbs, who in turn are lifting the siege of Sarajevo.</p>

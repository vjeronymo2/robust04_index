			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Japan The end of the fiscal year today marks the start of a testing time for Japanese equities. Higher share prices and a strong yen have helped banks comfortably to meet their BIS capital ratios. According to the bear argument, the passage of this important deadline will allow the authorities to leave the equity market to fend for itself. The recent rally may thus prove little more than an artificial end-year spike. Such worries, however, look overdone, not least because the government has lasting reasons for concern about the stock market. One of them is its desire to shore up other parts of the financial sector, notably life insurance companies whose solvency margins have been under pressure. Another is its plan to privatise more of Japan's railway network. Yet another is the need to maintain consumer confidence at a time of general uncertainty about the impact of corporate restructuring. By talking up NTT, the authorities have found a way of capturing the public imagination as well as helping the market as a whole. After hints that NTT's rate increases may be brought forward, the company's shares have risen some 50 per cent since the start of the year, dragging other high technology stocks up in its wake. The market has become convinced that the government is trying to engineer recovery based on technological renewal rather than traditional pump priming. That thought may continue to underpin share prices even if there will be a long wait before a turnround in earnings provides an excuse for the market to go decisively higher.</p>

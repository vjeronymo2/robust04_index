They focussed on  international issues, Balkan ones in particular, with special  stress on the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, said the Turkish  guest at the close of the talks. The Turkish foreign minister  enlarged on the appeal launched by President Suleyman Demirel  today before Romania's Parliament, an appeal addressed to  Bosnian Serbs to find a way to adhere to a confederation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Also, the stage of the relations between the two countries  and their neighbours was surveyed, in Romania's case with  Hungary and Ukraine, and in Turkey's case with Greece and the  states in the Caucasian ex-Soviet region, as well as the two  countries' relations with the European Union from the angle of  the Union's extension with new members.    Turkey's unconditional support was reiterated to Romania in  the process of integration in the NATO, the Romanian Foreign  Ministry spokesman Mircea Geoana said at the end of the round of  talks.</p>

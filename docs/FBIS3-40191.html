Mao Yingliang, director of the Shanghai Municipal Branch of  the People's Bank of China, said yesterday that Shanghai's  financial circles must quicken its tempo in deepening the reform  of the financial system. He expressed his views on Shanghai's  financial reform for the next year.    Mao Yingliang was interviewed yesterday right after he  attended the class for leading cadres in Shanghai to study  Volume 3 of Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. Through  the study of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, the  cadres in Shanghai's financial circles have deepened their  understanding of the remarks made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping who  said: "When a single move of chess is lively, the whole game of  chess becomes lively. This applies to the financial affairs" and  "Shanghai has gained international standing in financial  affairs. First of all, we must rely on Shanghai." Meanwhile,  remarkable achievements have been attained in implementing the  measures laid down by the central authorities on exercising  macroeconomic control. All this has provided Shanghai with  conditions to deepen Shanghai's financial reform in ideology and  in practice.    First of all, Mao Yingliang analyzed the current financial  situation in Shanghai. He pointed out that after exercising the  macroeconomic control, Shanghai's financial order in Shanghai  has been stabilized and its business operation becomes normal.  The amount of bank deposits and loans is increasing on a large  scale. The financial market remains active and opens wider to  the outside world. All this supports the sustained, rapid and  healthy development of Shanghai's economy. By the end of  November, the total amount of deposits of all types in Shanghai  was increased by 33.8 billion yuan over that in the same period  at the end of the last year, marking a growth of 9.08 billion  yuan as compared with that in the corresponding period in the  previous year. There is a regular increase of saving deposits.  As compared with the end of the last year, the amount of savings  deposits rose by 13.5 billion yuan, more than 90 percent of  which were fixed-term deposits. The amount of deposits from  government enterprises also sharply rose. With the amount of  deposits increasing, there is a steady rate of growth in loans.  The funds are being used on all major construction projects in  support of the economic development in Shanghai. Various  specialized banks turn over 9.8 percent of their deposits to the  central bank as reserve requirements, 4 percent more than that  before the macro-economic control and higher than what they are  required to do. The financial market is unprecedentedly active.  The annual volume of business on the security market is expected  to reach 500 billion yuan; the total amount of foreign exchange  that change hands on the swap market may exceed U.S.$4 billion;  and the total amount of inter-bank loans will reach 210 billion  yuan. The balance of inter-bank exchange remains normal, the  rate on the swap market is basically stable, and the situation  in the returns of money is fine. Mao Yingliang believed that the  measures adopted by the central authorities in exercising the  macroeconomic control has brought stability and prosperity to  Shanghai's financial circles and created a good environment for  further deepening the financial reform for the next year.    On the financial reform for the next year, Mao Yingliang put  forward the following seven tasks on the basis of the principle  of emancipating our thinking and seeking truth from facts:    1. We must introduce the market mechanism to energetically  cultivate and develop the financial market. Foreign exchange,  money, securities and gold markets should be further expanded  and developed. Efforts must be made in establishing the center  for foreign exchange of China. This center located at No 15 Bund  in Shanghai is now under construction. It is expected to go into  operation in early 1994. This is a large, nation-wide market. It  is necessary to make use of this market to form a national  unified foreign exchange market and a nation-wide system for a  unified foreign exchange rate. Meanwhile, it is essential to  unify foreign exchange rates in coordination with the reform in  foreign exchange system and to lay a foundation for the  internationalization of our currencies. Efforts must be made to  improve the money markets including the short-term national  bonds market, the inter-bank loan market and the discount  market; and exercise macro-economic control with open market  operations. It is essential to further improve the securities  market and enterprise management system, and optimize the  allocation of resources. Currently, the Shanghai securities  market has basically become the national business center in this  connection. During the next year, it will further expand  business and promote standardization. Efforts should be made to  build a gold market according to international standards. During  the last year, more than 10 tons of gold jewelry were sold in  Shanghai. The sale of such gold jewelry is expected to exceed 20  tons this year. We must study how to increase transactions in  gold bullions and gold certificates.    2. We must truly turn state commercial banks into ones which  operate like modern commercial banks. First, efforts must be  made to help specialized banks separate the existing  policy-lending business from commercial lending business and  engage in the management of the proportions of assets and  liabilities and in management of risks. They must be helped to  develop a mechanism of assuming responsibilities for their own  business management, their own risks, profits and losses, and in  restraining and developing themselves. It is imperative to help  the existing commercial banks develop a mechanism to operate  like genuine commercial banks. They must be allowed to compete,  and their businesses be permitted to overlap with one another.    3. We must actively and steadily develop the system of  cooperative banks and establish rural and urban cooperative  banks. Urban cooperative banks must be established on the basis  of the 99 existing urban credit cooperatives. They should serve  the small- and medium-sized enterprises and render regional  economic services. Urban cooperative banks should operate at  the grassroots and the city level. All of them enjoy their  status as independent legal persons. Rural cooperative banks  should be established on the basis of existing rural credit  cooperatives. State commercial banks may hold shares of rural  cooperative banks, but may not change the latter's  characteristics in cooperating with each other on a collective  basis.    4. It is necessary to open wider to the outside world in  financial affairs, and welcome more foreign-funded banks to open  up their branches in Shanghai. We hope that the number of  branches of foreign banks will reach 50 in 1995. Foreign-funded  banks are welcome to move their regional head offices or their  head offices in China to Shanghai. We must strive to carry out  experiments in allowing a limited number of foreign-funded  financial institutions to do business in renminbi.    5. It is imperative to popularize the use of computers in  financial operations. During the next year, we must set up a  credit card network and use computers for local check clearance.    6. We must blaze new trails in improving ways in handling  financial affairs including business in offshore financing,  mortgage loans, and others. It is necessary to develop real  estate financing business in close connection with housing  reform.    7. We must strengthen the macroeconomic control in financial  affairs. The central bank must strengthen its financial  supervision and auditing and further standardize the procedure  in handling financial affairs. Particular efforts must be made  to change from direct control to effective indirect control by  improving the market mechanism.</p>

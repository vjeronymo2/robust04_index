			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> FLINTRIDGE PREP'S WIN ENDS EIGHT-YEAR DROUGHT  </P> <P> The Flintridge Prep football team ended eight years of frustration last week  when the Rebels defeated Pasadena Poly, 27-6, in a Prep League game.  </P> <P> Flintridge Prep, which usually features a pass-happy attack led by quarterback  Chris Bisgaard and David Swayne, scored its first win over Pasadena Poly since  1980 by rolling up 250 rushing yards.  </P> <P> Tailback Lyle Mays gained a game-high 127 yards in 14 carries while fullback  David Park added 92 yards in 19 carries.  </P> <P> A Flintridge Prep win over Chadwick on Friday would guarantee the Rebels a spot  in the Southern Section eight-man playoffs.  </P> <P> Perfect season: Occidental's Laurie Schuster finished the Southern California  Intercollegiate Athletic Conference cross-country season unbeaten, winning the  5,000-meter SCIAC championship race in 18 minutes, 44 seconds last Saturday at  La Mirada Park.  </P> <P> Schuster, a junior, beat her nearest competitor by more than a minute.  </P> <P> The win qualified Schuster for the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division  III West Regionals at Santa Cruz on Nov. 11.  </P> <P> The Occidental women's team, which was third overall in the SCIAC  championships, tied Claremont and Pomona for the conference title.  </P> <P> Getting his kicks: Former La Canada High punter Rob Myers is kicking up a storm  for Washington State.  </P> <P> Myers, 21, is averaging 44.8 yards a punt for the Cougars, which ranks the  senior second in the Pacific-10 Conference and fourth nationally.  </P> <P> Armed forces: Franklin High quarterback Santiago Alvarez continued his dream  season last Friday, completing 26 of 36 passes for 361 yards and six touchdowns  during the Panthers' 44-0 win over Hollywood.  </P> <P> Alvarez has completed 168 of 273 passes this season for 2,111 yards and 28  touchdowns while throwing just six interceptions.  </P> <P> "He's doing everything we could have asked of him," Franklin Coach Armando  Gonzalez said. "There isn't a better passer in the City."  </P> <P> Franklin (6-1 overall) has outscored opponents, 260-28. The Panthers are tied  with Wilson for the Northern Conference lead with a 4-0 league record.  </P> <P> Add Panther passers: Former Franklin High standout Ronnie Lopez has also been  passing for big yardage since becoming the starter at Glendale College three  games ago.  </P> <P> Lopez completed 11 of 16 attempts for 238 yards and three touchdowns last  Saturday during the Vaqueros' 62-26 rout of Harbor.  </P> <P> Lopez has completed 45 of 83 passes for 809 yards and seven touchdowns this  season. He has thrown three interceptions.  </P> <P> On the run: For the first time in school history, three Glendale College  running backs each rushed for more than 100 yards in one game.  </P> <P> In the Vaqueros' win over Harbor, tailback Sean Hampton had a game-high 146  yards while tailback Doug Dragomer rushed for 110 yards and fullback Wes Bender  added 103 yards and four touchdowns.  </P> <P> Tighten up: Glendale's victory over Harbor pleased Coach John Cicuto, but he  had no defense for a defensive unit that surrendered 26 points to a team that  had been shut out three times this season.  </P> <P> "Our defense is struggling with peaks and valleys," Cicuto said. "They play  hard, but mentally they break down and it kind of puts us into a bind.  </P> <P> "We can't rely on our offense to score 40 or 50 points a game. It's just not  going to happen against the good teams."  </P> <P> A team, for example, like Moorpark.  </P> <P> Glendale (4-2-1 overall, 3-1-1 in Western State Conference play) travels to  Moorpark this Saturday for a game against the Raiders, who boast the top  defense in the state.  </P> <P> On the rebound: Unlike Glendale, Occidental had no problems with consistency  last Saturday against Whittier.  </P> <P> The Tigers played poorly from start to finish in a 26-16 loss.  </P> <P> "They didn't do anything we weren't prepared for, we just didn't play very  well," Occidental Coach Dale Widolff said.  </P> <P> "We tackled terribly, probably the worst we've ever had."  </P> <P> Occidental (5-2 overall, 3-1 in SCIAC play) meets Redlands (4-3, 4-0) at home  on Saturday.  </P> <P> Occidental can guarantee itself a share of the SCIAC championship by defeating  the Bulldogs.  </P></p>

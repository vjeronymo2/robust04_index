			<p>CSO     [Text] Tehran, 17 Ordibehesht [7 May] IRNA -- At a  gathering to study the nation's latest economic changes, Dr.  Kashan, consultant to the Central Bank of Iran, said: Last year  the country, whose population has reached 60 million, was  managed with $7 billion in imports, and this means that the many  capacities have been created inside the country.    Speaking at a joint meeting of the Chamber of Commerce and  the Iran and Germany Official Industries Organization, he added:  It is true that in the last two years the country and the banks  have been faced with delayed payments, but to make up for this  loss, in the last four years more work was done than projected  in the Five-Year Plan, and the average growth of 8.1 percent in  GNP is a good indication of thriving economic activity.    The Central Bank consultant said: In the year 1367 [21 March  1988-20 March 1989] Iran imported 4.5 to 5 million tons of wheat  per year, while in the year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993]  and 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] this figure decreased to  2.5 million tons. Imports of almost 4 million tons of iron and  steel in the year 1367 changed to exports of 1 million tons of  these materials in the year 1372.    Dr. Kashan said the nation's capacity to produce oil  by-products increased from 2.5 million barrels per day [BPD] in  the year 1367 to the present 4.5 million BPD. He added: The  Islamic Republic of Iran carried out its Five-Year Economic  Development Plan with fewer than 500 foreign experts, and its  capital formations grew to 23 percent of GNP.    Concerning the extent of Iran's indebtedness, he added:  Iran's total debts, including the suspended payments and what  will come due in the future, will be paid in the next five years  without any problem according to the payment schedule that has  been established.    He added: This is provided that payments are not delayed by  a  drop in the value of the dollar against other reputable  currencies such as the yen and the mark, or by a drop in the  price of oil.</p>

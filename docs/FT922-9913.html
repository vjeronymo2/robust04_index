			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Prescott backs Labourlink with trade unions MR John Prescott, the candidate of the traditional blue-collar left in Labour's deputy leadership election, yesterday hit out at calls for a 'new vision' for the party and claimed that its historic goals are as relevant now as they were a century ago. In a toughly worded speech to a May Day rally in Gwent, the shadow transport spokesman defended Labour's links with the trade unions and implicitly castigated party 'modernisers' who argue for fundamental change to Labour's message. His speech came as Mr Bryan Gould and Mrs Margaret Beckett, the two other contenders for the post, stepped up their efforts to appeal to the left. Both, however, have adopted postures aimed as much at the reforming wing of the party, especially on party reform and constitutional change, as at the traditional left. Vigorously backing the case for collective action to back a campaign for a fairer distribution of wealth, Mr Prescott said: 'There is much talk of the need for new radicalism and new vision in the Labour party. But what is wrong with the old vision?' Advocating policies of full employment, accountable public ownership, quality health, welfare and education services, and housing for all, he said that Labour's main problem was the 'lack of the conviction necessary to challenge a society in which the distribution of power and wealth is so unequal and unjust'. Mr Prescott, who won the backing of 64 MPs for his deputy leadership challenge, said reform of the unions' block vote and role in leadership selection must be debated. But he added that with the union movement under attack from the Conservative government it was essential to recognise the need for solidarity between the party and the organisations that founded it. 'These reforms should strengthen the essential link between us, not weaken our relations for fear that our links will be used against us by our opponents,' he said. Meanwhile Mrs Beckett used a weekend television interview to remind the party of her backing for Mr Tony Benn's deputy leadership challenge in 1981 and reiterated her reservations about Mr Neil Kinnock's abandonment of a unilateral nuclear disarmament policy.</p>

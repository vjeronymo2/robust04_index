They note that attempts to secure credits from the  governments of Latvia and Russia to build settlements in the  Pskov region where construction sites have already been provided  for repatriates have been deadlocked.    They tell Clinton that they would appreciate assistance from  American businessmen to build a construction materials  enterprise, a creamery and a meat packing plant in the area.    "We do not want to be a blind weapon in the hands of  nationalists like Zhirinovskiy and his party, playing skillfully  on our feelings," the message says.    As the Association's Chairman Vyacheslav Tikhomirov has  reported to INTERFAX, about 5000 people are ready to leave  Latvia for Russia.    According to the results of a poll made available earlier in  the week to Max van der Stoel, the CSCE high commissionaire for  ethnic minorities who visited Latvia last week, 160,000 people  want to go to Russia and 190,000 to western countries from  Latvia.</p>

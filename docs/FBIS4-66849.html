Pandit: "Congress Party's Internal </F> Dissatisfaction"]    [Text] The administrative style of Prime Minister Narasimha  Rao, president of the Congress (I) Party, has sent forth a wave  of dissatisfaction in the inner camp of the party. Some Congress  leaders say that the party president has formed the policy  according to the suggestions of his favorite people who have  their own vested interests. They get the approval of the party  president for whatever they want and use it for controlling  state politics. This has resulted in mutual differences between  all states from north to south and from east to west. In states  where a party president must be elected, the reports presented  by the committees and observation teams will get attention  depending on the politics of the party president's favorite  people who have the permission to stand around him. It would not  be inappropriate to say that getting the favorable interest of  these favored people is in the minds of all state party leaders  and workers. It is said that if anyone takes the courage to say  anything about these favored people, the party president without  any investigation puts such a stamp on the campaigner that that  person has no alternative but to remain silent in the future.  However, the request made by 50 prominent Congress leaders in  Bihar to the party president on 20 April to reorganize Bihar  state's Congress Party structure and veteran Congress Leader Dr  Jagan Nath Mishra's supporters's opposition to it illustrates  the situation that has arisen in the inner camp of the party.  The deputation of eight veteran leaders from Bihar that met with  the prime minister reminded us of the forgotten fact that  between 1990 and 1994 the state Congress (I) neither held a  rally in Patna's Gandhi Maidan nor did the state party president  travel at the district level to strengthen the party. Now that  the committees' terms have ended on 14 April, many obstructions  are seen in the path to obstruct those committees preparing for  the next vidhan sabha elections. Now they are waiting for the  prime minister's visit to Bihar on 30 April. According to  sources close to the prime minister, Mr. Rao will be successful  in controlling the situation there by making some important  announcements during his visit. It is also possible that the  prime minister will announce the establishment of Jharkhand  independent federation and be successful in changing the image  of his party. He has controlled the controversial situation in  Bihar to an extent by inviting Dr. Jagannath Misra for talks in  Delhi and also by including Ram Lakhan Yadav in the central  cabinet. We cannot say how much wMr. Rao's quiet politics will  be successful in U.P. [Uttar Pradesh] because the party  position in U.P. is a lot worse than it is in Bihar. The result  of this situation is seen in the recent vidhan sabha election.  To control the situation, four powerful members of the Congress  Party's central committee--Mr. Jaffar Sharif, Mr. Beant Singh,  Mr. Venkataraman Swami, and Navalkishore Sharma--have been sent  there to interview former legislators. Will all this information  be presented to the party president accurately? There is also  the fear that in any situation Mr. Rao will pay more attention  to his favorite political advisors. Will the Congress workers  from western U.P. and from other parts of the state have the  freedom to express their feelings to the prime minister so that  they can be brave like those eight members from Bihar were? The  hardworking U.P. leaders who are spending the last part of their  life in the capital say that the U.P. leaders have the tendency  to bow down to the high command from the beginning.  Traditionally, U.P. leaders have done whatever the high command  had ordered them. The high command decision will be the same as  his closer associates desire, because the central cabinet  members who represent the U.P. Congress have developed the habit  of not opposing any decision. According to political observers,  the height of those who represent U.P. at the Center has  diminished in the eyes of the prime minister. The remaining  leaders from the state have either been expelled or have been  silenced by awarding them with minor positions or have promised  them such positions. They are all waiting to see who will be the  president and whose luck will shine by getting one of the other  vacant positions. Whatever the close associates of the party  high command decide will be implemented. The politicians in the  capital are expressing doubts about Congress Party (I) getting a  new life in Bihar and U.P. because those who have damaged the  party image do no seem to be interested in the future of the  party. Why has work that was needed to be done in U.P. and Bihar  been ignored for the last two years? The three powerful  members--Madhavrao Scindia, K.C. Lekha, and Party General  Secretary Scinde--who were sent to Himachal Pradesh, said that  Chief Minister Virbhadar Singh should continue on in his two  positions. It will depend on the high command whether or not the  committee members will present their reports. The teams sent to  Andhra Pradesh under the leadership of Chief Minister Vijay  Bhaskar Reddy and composed of Ahmed Patel, Jagdish Titler, and  Mrs. Kailashpati recommended that a president of the state  Congress Party must be appointed, because former president  Madren has been appointed the leader of the legislative group.  The decision on a state party president should be made according  to the report of this committee and the results of inquiry that  is being made now. Who will that person be? The prime minister  will have to decide that. A similar answer was given by the four  members of the visiting team--Ramlakhan Singh Yadav, Sushil  Kumar Scinde, Mohsina Kidwai and R.K. Dhawan--on return from  Bhopal. They said, they have to go back again. Madhya Pradesh  has a lot of support for such leaders as Madhav Rao Scindia,  Vidhyacharan Shukla, Shyamcharan Shukla, Arjun Singh, and  Digvijay Singh. It is very difficult to make a decision about  this state, because the director of Madhya Pradesh leadership is  in Delhi and whatever he wishes will probably will be approved  by the high command. This is the situation in the Hindi-speaking  states or the so-called Hindi Heartland. One can glimpse in  Delhi what is happening to the party in southern states. The two  factions of the party from Tamil Nadu are fighting with each  other. The main reason for this dissension according to veteran  party leaders is the policies adopted at the Center. The two  groups are so lost in their fight that even Moopnar, the party  leader, has failed to straighten out the situation. It is said  that one Congress group supports Tamil Nadu's Chief Minister  Jayalalitha and the other group opposes her. At present, they  cannot decide whether to remove or keep Rama Murthy, the  president of the Tamil Nadu Congress.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Truce?"] </F>   [Text] The apparent softening of Begum Nusrat Bhutto's  attitude towards her daughter, after a long and bitter spate of  recriminations, is being interpreted in political circles as a  temporary truce, which could flare up again into open war at the  slighter provocation. That provocation, if the allegations of  arrest of two guards of 70-Clifton is to be believed, has  already been provided. In the meantime Mir Murtaza Bhutto,  though still behind bars, has announced the formation of a  parallel organisation to the PPP [Pakistan People's Party],  called the Bhutto group. He hopes to attract to it the truly  `sincere and dedicated' workers of the PPP. If and when the  group takes off, it may or may not drain the mainstream PPP of  its core, but it could certainly emerge as a splinter, capable  of causing damage to the party in Sindh. The crucial factor in  all this will obviously be the help and patronage of the Begum.  Deprived of his mother's support the Murtaza faction could  remain still-born. Therefore, the Prime Minister, in her own  interest would perhaps try to keep her mother out of the  divisive scheme that her brother has launched. She may try to  acquire her mother's symbolic, if not actual, association with  the main party. That of course, would not only be in the best  interest of the PPP but also in the best interest of the  evolution of a two-party system in the country. The split in  the Muslim League has already done a lot of damage to that  process. A split in the PPP would only aggravate that  situation and would, in the days to come, make the forming of a  stable government even more difficult.    The truce, if it holds, is the first hopeful sign in damage  control since the unceremonious ouster of Begum Bhutto from the  Chairpersonship of the PPP. But it obviously does not mean the  end of the rift. The Begum has opted not to speak out for the  time being, but there is no indication yet of her having given  an inch on her demand of being restored to the office of  Chairpersonship. Even if she were to accept a symbolic office  to salve her hurt ego and give up the quest for the big prize,  Mir Murtaza having already launched himself on his course of  sister-bashing, is not likely to give up. The Begum could thus  be instigated again and again by him to choose between the son  whom she considers the legitimate heir of his father's legacy  and her daughter who kept the party together and brought it  twice to power. It may not thus be just a triangular fight  within the family for the PPP crown, but an emotional divide  within the Begum herself. Because, unless Mir Murtaza decides  to rein in his overweening ambition, the Begum will eventually  have to cast her lot with one or the other of her siblings. [as  published]</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Twenty die in Stepanakert missile attack MORE than 20 people were reported killed in Nagorno-Karabakh yesterday in fresh violence between rival Armenians and Azeris, Reuter reports from Moscow. The new spate of violence, attributed by Itar-Tass news agency to Azeri shelling of the capital Stepanakert, occurred four years to the day after former President Mikhail Gorbachev sent the army into the enclave on the southern fringe of the old Soviet Union. Itar-Tass, quoting an Armenian foreign ministry official in Stepanakert, said the town had been hit by a barrage of 180 missiles which had destroyed the parliament building and a radio and television centre. High-level peace talks sponsored by the Russian foreign ministry, scheduled for today, remained in doubt after conflicting signals from the two sides.</p>

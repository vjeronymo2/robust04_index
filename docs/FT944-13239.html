			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: A picture of the UK being increasingly marginalised Sir, Joe Rogaly's column, 'A royal pipe-dream' (October 18), was excellent in drawing attention to the decline, moral and otherwise, that Britain has sadly allowed itself to succumb to. As an ex-pat for the last 7 1/2 years in the US, I have witnessed the UK's increasing marginalisation with growing anxiety. While other European countries get widespread coverage in US print and broadcast media with their trading, industrial and technological achievements, Britain's coverage seems limited to the latest folly about the royal family or the government. Meanwhile, UK companies, advertising to US audiences, seem to perpetuate the stereotype of the British class system. The full extent to which Britain has failed to get its message across about the role it can play came home to me the other day. An American friend was discussing renewed tensions in Kuwait and recalled the Gulf war. 'I think the best troops, apart from the Americans and the Israelis, were the Jordanians and the French,' he said. He was unaware of the SAS raids on the Scuds (although John Major has since commented on them), or of the RAF low-level strikes against the Iraqi airfields, or, indeed, of any British participation. The good things that Britain can do get overshadowed by a whole lot of absolutely trite, irrelevant imagery that portrays the country as a museum run by patronising dodderers for the benefit of a few capricious duchesses. I have noticed, with reference to your comments on the millennium commission, that many Americans are unsure that Britain truly knows which century is about to close around its ears. Something must be done - unless Britain is to return to its pre-industrial status of an insignificant island somewhere off the north-west coast of Europe.

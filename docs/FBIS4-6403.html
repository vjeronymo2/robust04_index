The prospect emerged after the House  of Representatives Steering Committee agreed not to convene the  vote-taking plenary session Thursday.    Efforts among ruling coalition parties to set policies  before  picking a successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  are floundering over differences on tax reform and national  security, coalition sources said.</p>

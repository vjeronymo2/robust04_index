			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ASSAULT GUN BAN MADE PERMANENT;  </P> <P> U.S. EMBARGOES 43 MILITARY-STYLE WEAPONS, INCLUDING AK-47S AND UZIS  </P> <P> The vast majority of assault weapons barred from importation since spring will  be banned permanently from the United States, the government announced Friday.  </P> <P> The ban imposed on 43 styles of semiautomatic weapons -- including the popular  Chinese-made AK-47 and Israeli-made Uzi carbine -- followed a four-month study  by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms on whether the weapons met the  standards imposed by the Gun Control Act of 1968, which barred importation of  weapons that are not used for legitimate sporting purposes.  </P> <P> "The study was undertaken because of the dramatic increase in the number of  these weapons being imported and police reports of their use in violent crime,"  said Stephen E. Higgins, ATF director.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 7 Permitted  </P> <P> While the 43 were banned permanently, another seven whose imports had been  suspended since early spring will be available for import again as a result of  the study. Those include six .22-rimfire caliber rifles and a gun called the  Valmet Hunter, which had been considered an AK-47 type of weapon during the  suspension.  </P> <P> The ATF, which studied the marketing and use of the weapons, said the models  banned were not being used for sporting purposes. Such weapons were identified  officially Friday as "semiautomatic assault rifles."  </P> <P> The ATF annually traces 35,000 to 40,000 guns used in crimes, and about 10% of  them are semiautomatic assault weapons, Higgins said. He estimated that  slightly more than half of them were domestic makes that are not subject to ATF  control.  </P> <P> "We're not saying that it (the assault weapon importation ban) will solve the  basic problem" of crime, Higgins said, adding, "Their use in crime is probably  disproportionately high compared with the number that are here."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Folding Stock  </P> <P> Holding aloft one of the banned weapons -- an Israeli-made Galil rifle --  Higgins pointed out some of the accouterments that led to its prohibition: a  folding stock, a night sight, a flash suppressor on the end that could serve as  a grenade launcher, its ability to accept a bayonet lug, a pistol grip and a  large magazine.  </P> <P> In the future, he said, weapons with several of these features probably also  would be subject to an import ban.  </P> <P> Higgins estimated that the Customs Service has seized about 20,000 of the  weapons and that those will not be allowed into the country unless purchased by  law enforcement agencies. Asked whether the government will pay damages to  importers, Higgins said, "That's something the court would decide."  </P> <P> Three importers already have sued the government over the suspension, and  although a U.S. District Court has upheld the government in one of the cases,  Higgins said the ATF would accept comments on the permanent ban from any  importers for 30 days. The final regulations would be issued "very quickly"  after that, he said.  </P> <P> Asked why the ATF previously had allowed imports of the now-banned weapons,  Higgins said the committee set up after the 1968 law was passed to determine  whether guns qualified for import had "concentrated primarily, almost  exclusive, on handguns." It was not until the number of assault weapons being  imported increased dramatically that the ATF focused on them, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Action Lauded  </P> <P> The action Friday was lauded by gun control advocates, but John M. Snyder,  spokesman for the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, said  it "shows the undependability of government, because originally, the ATF had  certified that these rifles could be imported because they are suitable for  sporting purposes.  </P> <P> "I think it also tends to further undermine whatever credibility President Bush  has left with the firearms-owning community in the United States," Snyder said.  </P> <P> Bush, a hunter and a lifetime member of the National Rifle Assn., came into  office opposing any ban on assault weapons despite an outcry over their  increasing popularity among drug gangs and a heightened public concern  triggered by the January schoolyard slayings of five children in Stockton,  Calif., by a man wielding an AK-47.  </P> <P> However, Bush asked William J. Bennett, the director of the Office of National  Drug Control Policy, to advise him on what to do about the weapons. In March,  at Bennett's urging, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady suspended the  importation of many of the weapons, and Bush expanded the list the next month.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. Guns Not Affected  </P> <P> The ATF, which has the power to control imports, does not regulate domestic  manufacture of weapons, so similar weapons made in the United States would not  be affected by the action. Several bills pending in Congress would control or  eliminate many of the U.S.-made assault weapons.  </P> <P> The ATF has estimated that domestic models account for 75% of the 3 million  semiautomatic rifles now owned by Americans. Colt Industries Inc. suspended  sales of its AR-15, the most popular of the domestic assault semiautomatic  rifles, in March.  </P> <P> Sarah Brady, chairwoman of Handgun Control Inc., praised the ATF's action as  Bush's "leadership in working toward reducing assault weapon violence by  stopping the import of these weapons of war."  </P> <P> "I urge the President and the Congress to continue in the direction of public  safety by passing legislation to stop the domestic production of assault  weapons," said Brady, whose husband, former White House press secretary Jim  Brady, was severely wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt on President  Ronald Reagan. "It is no more acceptable to have citizens being gunned down by  killing machines wearing a 'Made in the USA' label than by those made abroad."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gun Limits Decried  </P> <P> The NRA has argued vociferously against limits on the rights of law-abiding  citizens to own the weapons and has urged a crackdown on criminals rather than  gun-control laws.  </P> <P> The weapons on the original suspension list come primarily from China, Israel,  West Germany and Belgium. Others are made in Austria, Australia, Italy and  Switzerland, among other countries.  </P></p>

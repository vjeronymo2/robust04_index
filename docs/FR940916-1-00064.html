Where such waivers are granted from coverage under the DBA, the waiver is conditioned on providing other worker's compensation coverage to employees to which the waiver applies. Usually this takes the form of securing worker's compensation coverage of the country where work will be performed or of the employee's native country, whichever offers greater benefits. Information as to whether a DBA waiver has been obtained by the Department for a particular country may be obtained from the contracting officer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> (End of clause) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 172.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 7 (XINHUA) -- The development of  relations between Mongolia and China enjoys a promising  prospect, said visiting Mongolian Minister of External Relations  Tserenpiliyn Gombosuren.    In an exclusive interview with XINHUA here this afternoon,  Gombosuren voiced his satisfaction over the talks with Chinese  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen yesterday and meeting with Premier  Li Peng this afternoon.    He said there would be "two important events" in  Sino-Mongolian ties this year. One is Chinese Premier Li peng's  Mongolia visit at the end of this month, and the other the  upcoming China visit by Chairman Nachagyn Bagabandy of the  Mongolian State Great Hural.    The high-level exchange of visits between the two countries  would be of major significance in the development of bilateral  links, he added.    Gombosuren noted that the two countries' economic and trade  relations have been expanding in recent years. Last year  Mongolia's trade volume with China, in which border trade played  an important role, accounted for one-fourth of the country's  total trade volume.    He pointed out that there exist great potential and a bright  future in the cooperation between the two countries in such  fields as fuel, power and transportation.    He stressed that it is the priority of Mongolia's foreign  policy to develop friendly relations with China and Russia, two  neighbors of Mongolia.    Gombosuren and his party arrived here yesterday. In addition  to Beijing they are also scheduled to tour Tianjin and Nanjing.</p>

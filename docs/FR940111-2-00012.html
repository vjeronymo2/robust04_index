The CME&hyph;ICC&hyph;OCC program would involve the cross-margining of positions in specified commodity futures, commodity options, and securities options (``eligible contracts'') carried for, among others, certain market professional customers. These market professionals would include CME members and firms owning CME memberships, members of exchanges cleared by ICC, and market makers, specialists, and registered traders on securities options markets whose accounts would not be proprietary within the meaning of Commission Regulation 1.3(y), 17 CFR 1.3(y), (``participating market professionals'') and whose positions are carried by participating futures commission merchants (``FCMs'') that also are participating broker-dealers (``B/Ds'') or by participating FCMs and their affiliated participating B/Ds which may also be FCMs (together ``participating clearing firms'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 5a(a)(12)(A) of the Act provides that the Commission shall approve contract market rules only if such rules ``are determined by the Commission not to be in violation of [the] Act or the regulations of the Commission.'' Commingling of futures and non-futures funds of customers currently is not permitted under the Commission's regulations. Section 4d(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. &sect;6d(2), however, authorizes the Commission to issue an order prescribing the terms and conditions under which ``money, securities, and property (received by an FCM to margin, guarantee or secure the commodity futures trades or contracts of a customer) may be commingled *&blank;*&blank;* with any other money, securities, and property received by such [FCM] and required by the Commission to be separately accounted for and treated and dealt with as belonging to the customers of such [FCM].'' Accordingly, any proposal which would permit such commingling would require Commission action pursuant to section 4d(2) of the Act, as well as Section 5a(a)(12)(A).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Whereas,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the CME&hyph;ICC&hyph;OCC non-proprietary cross-margining proposal provides for calculation by the participating clearing organizations of a single margin requirement to support the positions of participating market professionals in eligible contracts carried by participating clearing firms;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Whereas,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the Commission has reviewed the CME&hyph;ICC&hyph;OCC cross-margining proposal; new ICC rules 514, 515, 516, 517, 518, 519, and 520; proposed amendments to ICC Rules 101, 301, 302, 513 and 614; the proposed agreement among the participating clearing organizations; the proposed agreements among the participating clearing firms and the participating clearing organizations; and the proposed agreements among the participating market professionals and participating clearing firms submitted by letters dated September 21, 1992 through April 22, 1993; the representations of the participating clearing organizations as to the operation of the program; the representations of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (``SIPC'') and the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC''); and such other documents as constitute the complete record in this matter (``Record'');  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Whereas,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the agreements among participating market professionals, participating clearing firms, and participating clearing organizations require that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Each participating market professional acknowledge in writing that any money, securities or property, including securities option positions, held on his behalf in a non-proprietary cross-margining account (``cross-margining property'') will be treated in a manner consistent with the terms of this Order and any other applicable order issued by the Commission;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Each participating market professional acknowledge and agree in writing that any cross-margining property held on his behalf by a participating FCM or a participating B/D affiliated with a participating FCM will be customer property deemed to be received by the participating FCM to be accounted for, treated, and dealt with by such FCM as belonging to such market professional in a manner consistent with Section 4d of the Act;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

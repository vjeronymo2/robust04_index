			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Drive to boost stock exchange listings The London Stock Exchange plans to launch its first marketing effort aimed at encouraging non-British corporations to seek a listing in London, said Mr Michael Lawrence, the exchange's new chief executive. Mr Lawrence, who took charge in February, was outlining the changes he intends to put in place at the stock exchange. The exchange's image has suffered, particularly since the collapse last March of its Taurus project for paperless share settlement. 'We want to convince major international companies to list in London,' Mr Lawrence said, noting that the US-based exchanges have used their marketing skills to attract significant international business. 'We need to make London as attractive as we can and then go out and market it,' he said. The exchange's marketing move signals a significant cultural shift as it has never actively sought new business before. However, it is also likely to anger continental exchanges which believe London is already attracting business which is rightfully theirs. The marketing effort would focus on the corporate brokers to leading companies, but the exchange would arrange direct meetings with companies where appropriate. The exchange is also interested in encouraging the listing of more Eurobonds and convertible bonds. The New York Stock Exchange and the US-based National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System share exchange have both had extensive marketing operations for years and have been successful in persuading leading multinational companies to seek listings in the US. As part of the plan London is looking at Global Depositary Receipts - sterling-denominated packages of non-UK shares like the US-dollar denominated American Depositary Receipts. GDRs could have looser requirements for listing than ordinary corporate shares, Mr Lawrence said. Outsider in the hot seat, Page 19</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 24 May (MTI) -- A sophisticated  environment-protection programme for the Danube region has been  initiated recently by the Hungarian Ministry of Environment and  Regional Policy. Hungary also claims that an international  project should be approved in order to provide for all drainage  areas of the river. Hungary is the only European country  threatened by critial conditions in water supply around the year  2000.    The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  (FAO) registers Hungary among the first 30 (mainly desert)  states whose drinking water supply is not secured for the  future. Ninety-five percent of the surface waterways of the  country originate abroad, which causes purity and quantity  problems. In 1992 Hungary initiated an environment-protection  programme for the Danube Basin. In order to solve present  problems, which foreshadow further ones in the future, water  management should be regulated under an agreement, with strong  commitment by all concerned to carry through their respective  obligations, Hungarian authorities say. Hungarian specialists  say that although the country's water reserves are expected to  decline in the following years, they will probably still meet  all demand after the turn of the century.    Waiting to see the issue of surface waterways settled,  Hungary is striving to preserve its underground water reserves.  There is no agreement with Ukraine, Romania, or Slovakia that  would oblige these countries to inform Hungary on water  pollution occurring in their own territories. Slovakia, for  example, takes out such a large amount of water from the river  Sajo each summer that the Sajo enters Hungary no longer as a  river but rather as a small stream. Besides, Slovakia operates  two barrage irrigation systems on the river Ipoly. Another major  problem is the decline in water reserves near the Gabcikovo  barrage system.    Water filtered through gravel beds is excellent for  consumption. Wells operating on this principle supply the  population of the Danube Bend and Budapest through a pipe water  system and might serve as the drinking water source of around 4  million people in the future. (The population of Hungary is 10.3  million.) Nitrate pollutants have to be filtered in these wells  too, although 15 years ago this was not necessary. (Most of the  pollution is due to the lack of sewage networks in nearby  settlements.) The river Tisza in the eastern part of Hungary,  which springs from Ukraine and has been known for its clean  water over the past 25 years, has recently become polluted at  places. The river Koros, originating in Romania, has also  declined in quality.    "Karst" and artesian waters are the real preserves of  Hungary. According to recent figures, their quantity exceeds the  consumption of the public, industry, and agriculture. Though  mining has caused long-lasting and difficult-to-remedy changes,  experts expect earlier, better conditions to return within a  decade's time.    The Danube-Tisza region in eastern Hungary has been  seriously  endangered by the lack of irrigation water. In the past 15-20  years, successive droughts have reduced the ground water  surface. Traditional plants being unable to absorb water from  3-6 metres down, new species had to be introduced. However,  declines in the region's agricultural production have been  considerable.    Ninety-eight per cent of Hungary's population drinks piped  water. Per capita water consumption has fallen to 150 litres per  day from 250 litres in earlier years. Experts say that drinking  water should be separated from water used for other purposes  (washing, watering, etc.) with an extra pipe system added, as it  has been already in some western European countries.</p>

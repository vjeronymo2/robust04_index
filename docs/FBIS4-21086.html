			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article signed J.A.M.: "Ministro's Sailors"] </F>   [Text] Yurimaguas, the most important river port on the  lower Huallaga and one of the great entry points to Amazonia, is  also one of the forest capitals around which today operates one  of the most active drug trafficking bands.    The Huallaga River is navigable to deep-draught vessels up  to  this point. Beyond the port, upstream, traffic is limited to  launches. Distances are measured in launch/hours. The principal  product of traffic by this means is basic cocaine paste (BCP),  gathered by the so-called "traqueteros."    A port captaincy operates in Yurimaguas, which is manned by  a  detachment of the Peruvian Navy. From August to October 1993,  the period within which these events took place, the port  captain was Navy First Lieutenant Victor Herrera Sheen. One of  his deputies was AP [Peruvian Navy] Lieutenant Pedro Huarcaya  Briceno.    Huarcaya and Herrera are the central figures in this  account,  provided voluntarily by a maritime officer [oficial de mar] to  the Special Investigative Working Group on Drug Trafficking,  appointed by the Constituent Democratic Congress (CCD). The  investigative group is headed by Julio Castro Gomez of the  Democratic Movement of the Left (MDI).  <H5>  Telejo Airport </H5>   Leaving Yurimaguas going south on the Huallaga, after two  hours one arrives at the village of Telejo. In August  1993--according to the testimony of the maritime witness to the  CCD committee--a clandestine airport was constructed there under  the benign gaze of his chiefs.    Shortly before 1993, through the intermediate ports of  Garcilaso, Abel Guerra and La Boca, people noticed--and they  noticed it because access to the port is open--heavy traffic in  iron and cement from Yurimaguas to Telejo. Mention is made of  frequent shipments (it is not specified whether daily or weekly)  of 50 bags of cement. But there are no important building  projects in Telejo. Then why so much building material?    "The boat owners and the pilots told us that it was for the  airport," said the mariner.    The members of the CCD committee asked him specifically if  he  knew of BCP flights from Telejo.    "I knew of an initial flight about 30 days ago (calculating  dates, this had to be about mid-September) and of a second  flight Thursday at midnight (in mid-October), that is, with  night navigation.    Between 40 and 50 men worked on the project. But who gave  the  order to build the airstrip?  <H5>  The "Caletas" </H5>   The accuser also testified to an intense traffic of raw  materials for the manufacture of BCP. He mentioned kerosene,  carbonate, sulfuric acid, and calcium. The lieutenants observed  this without reacting.    The enumeration of the delivery points for these materials  by  the accuser is interesting. Within the environs of Yurimaguas he  indicated the settlement of Shitari, at 15 minute distance, and  Santa Elena, Santa Maria, Santa Isabel and Dos de Mayo, within a  similar radius.    At more remote distances--from two to three and a half  hours--he mentioned Shucushuyacu, Yarina, Shazuta and Huimbayoc.  The crude paste reaches these locations and is converted into  refined paste. The places where these conversions take place are  called "caletas."    All of these places centered around Huimbayoc form the  domain  of Waldo Vargas Arias, "capo" of the drug traffic, of Colombian  nationality, better known under the nickname of El Ministro.  <H5>  Which Authorities </H5>   The CCD committee asked the maritime officer for the names  of  the officials or authorities who knew of the activities he was  revealing.    "The only names of officers that I could give--he  replied--would be those of Lieutenant AP Pedro Huarcaya Briceno  and First Lieutenant AP Victor Herrera Sheen. Lieutenant Herrera  is the port captain and Lieutenant Huarcaya, chief of personnel,  reports to him daily."    The witness was asked whether he knew the version according  to which the military authorities were providing security to the  drug traffickers so that the airplanes could take off without  problems.    "I had no knowledge of that, but I can add something. One  can  see--he declared--police officers as well as naval officers  having meetings with people connected to the drug traffic. I can  mention Mr. Miguel or Luis Farro. This individual is known in  the area as a "narco." He has several launches that travel all  over the Huallaga. I have even seen two emissaries from El  Ministro who came from Huimbayoc to visit my superiors."  <H5>  Detachment in Yurimaguas </H5>   One of the premises of the maritime officer was that the  activities of the "traqueteros" or collectors was by means of  the launches.    "Did your immediate commander ever order an action against  these `traqueteros,''' he was asked.    "We were never ordered specifically to intervene against  `traqueteros.' However, on one occasion we crossed the river to  the Huimbayoc area, under the command of Lieutenant Huarcaya."    They departed in two launches at 0430, so as not to be seen.  But the crossing took place without incident. When they reached  Huimbayoc, Huarcaya deployed his people behind an island and  ordered them to act. They proceeded to search everyone without  distinction. Dollars were discovered, but no drugs. The  lieutenant claimed that the money came from drugs and gave the  order to seize it. Everyone turned over the proceeds to the  chief. Lieutenant Huarcaya kept the booty until the return to  Yurimaguas. Only then would he proceed to distribute it,  according to the rank of each.    Meanwhile, the operation continued. "This is good, and we  are  going to stay," he ordered.    A brothel was operating in Huimbayoc, on the banks of the  river, despite the explicit prohibition of the regulations. The  naval witness said that the rule is as follows: the entire  riverine zone is property of the state and no establishement of  that type may operate there.    On that tropical night, Lieutenant Huarcaya was the special  guest of a certain "Passion." The eight military personnel who  accompanied him acted as security. The naval witness and accuser  asserted that on that occasion, in addition to the pleasures  provided by the service, "Passion" paid Lieutenant Huarcaya the  sum of $2,000, so that the patrol would continue to turn a blind  eye to the brothel's activities. This is what is stated in the  testimony in the hands of the CCD's working committee.    Two caches were discovered in the village, the first of  about  120 kg and the second of 100 kg of paste in the process of  steeping, deposited in plastic drums.    "We must not get involved in problems. I am going to fix  things with the secretary for discipline of the night patrol,  Mr. Alegria aka `Guitarron,' and with the president, Mr.  Macedo," was the lieutenant's remark.    The detachment went to Yurimaguas. The amount collected was  $2,800 ($800 seized on the island and $2,000 paid by "Passion").  Huarcaya tipped the senior technician $60, those beneath him in  rank $40, and $20 to the corporal. The intelligence technician,  Reynero Gallo, was the one who actually paid out the shares. And  the rest of the booty? Naturally, there were complaints. "The  matter is closed and do not test my patience," was how  Lieutenant Huarcaya dealt with this issue.    "Do you know whether any of this money reached higher  ranking  personnel?" was an important question asked of the naval witness.    "No. The only officer of higher rank was Lieutenant Victor  Herrera Sheen, who at that moment was in Lima. Lieutenant Pedro  Huarcaya ordered the raid while he was alone. He did everything  without informing the director of captaincies, Admiral Texeira,  and without informing his superiors in Lima.''    The CCD Special Investigative Working Group on Drug  Trafficking, directed by Julio Castro Gomez, has been  investigating the case since the end of October 1993.  <H5>  [Box, p 35] </H5> <H5>  The Art of Escaping </H5>   Not only National Police personnel were involved in the  escape of the Colombian drug trafficker called El Ministro, on  May 1993, but also naval officers in charge of the Yurimaguas  Port Captaincy.    Also involved in the illegal liberation of Waldo Vargas  Arias, in exchange for a bribe of $100,000, were Navy  Lieutenants Victor Herrera sheen and Pedro Huarcaya Briceno,  officers who were in charge of the naval base at the port of  Yurimaguas at the time.    This is what is emphatically stated by the maritime officer,  who witnessed the events, and who decided late last year to  present himself to the CCD Special Investigative Working Group  on Drug Trafficking to tell the whole truth.    According to his testimony, two policemen whose names he  does  not know but who he could recognize, turned over to Navy  Lieutenant Victor Herrera the sum of $8,000. The money was paid  so that the naval officers would allow the departure without the  required authorization of the boat or launch on which El  Ministro, his companion, and two bodyguards made their escape.    A Navy quartermaster named Ramirez was an eye witness to the  payment of $8,000 and it was he who communicated the fact to the  rest of the personnel of the Captaincy. Quartermaster Ramirez  also claimed that four days before the arrival in Yurimaguas of  the PNP [Peruvian National Police] Investigative Commission, led  by General Rodolfo Angeles, the policemen met with the commander  of the Port Captaincy.    The Commission did not interview either of the two naval  officers. Neither did any Navy inspection team investigate the  incident. There is only the report of the appearance of a naval  inspector who limited himself to checking the Captaincy's  administrative work, according to the version of the accuser  that was provided to the CCD Working Group.    There is more. With regard to the various irregularities  that  have occurred at the Port Captaincy of Yurimaguas, the assistant  technician of the naval police, Jaime Huaman, submitted a  detailed report to the deputy chief of personnel in Lima. But  the outcome was negative. Informed of the report, Lieutenant  Herrera began to harass technician Huaman. The latter's report  described the lack of surveillance of drug trafficking in the  area and abuses of authority by the two officers.    Lieutenants Victor Herrera and Pedro Huarcaya continued on  at  the base in Yurimaguas until late last year, in spite of having  exceeded the six-month period of assignment to the area  established for officers.</p>

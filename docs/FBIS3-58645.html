			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Russia Without Mr. Gaydar"] </F>   [Text] By promising, on taking his leave from Boris  Yeltsin, to "pray for the success of the reforms" in Russia,  Bill Clinton was taking a dangerous gamble. A few hours later,  in fact, we learned of the resignation of Yegor Gaydar, the very  symbol of that reform policy.    This departure by the former prime minister may seem  logical.  Yegor Gaydar, who, with Boris Yeltsin, was the main loser in the  12 December parliamentary elections, is merely acting on the  defeat of his party, Russia's Choice, which despite considerable  resources and unconditional support from television, was clearly  overtaken by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. This election highlighted  one of the main handicaps of Yegor Gaydar and his friends:  Their inability to show they understand the fate and concerns  of their compatriots.    Although he does not refer to this in his resignation letter  -- he preferred to "go out" on two stronger themes, and  especially the very costly construction of a new parliament  building -- Yegor Gaydar, and the whole liberal wing of the  government, were seriously weakened by the December election.  His influence within the executive was reduced accordingly.  What the government will lose in talent and international  reputation -- rightly or wrongly, Mr. Gaydar was regarded as the  guarantor of reforms with regard to the Western governments and  the international financial institutions -- it could perhaps  gain in cohesion.    [Prime Minister] Viktor Chernomyrdin's previous "team" was  characterized by a plethora of staff and serious disagreements  among the ministers. What could the advocates of  ultraliberalism and the supporters of the "status quo" do  together other than what they have done for two years -- namely,  implement a seesawing economic policy that in many cases  succeeded in combining the injustices of rampant liberalism and  the cumbersome aspects of a persistent collectivism?    Viktor Chernomyrdin's hour seems to have come. Chosen by  Boris Yeltsin in December 1992, but from the list put forward by  the Supreme Soviet deputies to replace Yegor Gaydar, this  representative of big industry is particularly in favor with the  president since his declared loyalty during the "White House"  insurrection last October. The prime minister will henceforth  have a free hand to implement the "centrist" policy he  advocates. This team, smaller and more homogeneous, will  nonetheless have to define and impose this mythical third path  which aspires to be both reformist and social.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] This is the just-in news. According to broadcast  reports from Seoul, some 1,500 students belonging to the South  Korean Federation of General Student Councils convened at Seoul  Municipal University on 21 May and held a rally for the  resolution of inheriting the spirit of the 18 May Kwangju  popular resistance and opposing the United States.    In the meeting, the students called on the United States to  withdraw its nuclear inspection suppression on the North.  Denouncing the United States for imposing unreasonable pressure  on the North for its own interests, the participants strongly  called for the pullout of the nuclear weapons of the U.S. troops  occupying South Korea and the suspension of the commotions of  nuclear inspection suppression against the North.    After the rally, the students, in a high spirit, staged a  street demonstration and marched toward Chongno Street in  groups. As the students finally advanced into Chongno Street at  around 1730, the police ran amok to stop them. However, the  students continued a violent struggle without yielding to them.  This has been the just-in news.</p>

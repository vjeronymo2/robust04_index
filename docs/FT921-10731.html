			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Berlin property sale probe to include Sony AN INVESTIGATION by the European Commission into the sale of prime-site property near the former Berlin Wall to Daimler-Benz has been extended to Sony, the Japanese electronics manufacturer, which bought a nearby property from city authorities. The investigation will determine whether the companies received an illegal subsidy from the city to buy the real estate on Potsdamer Platz. The area was the pre-war heart of Berlin, but is now a vast barren square populated mainly by rabbits. The bunker where Adolf Hitler committed suicide in May 1945 lies under a mound on the site. The Commission could declare both contracts invalid or agree to the companies making hefty additional payments. An independent valuation ordered by the Commission last year and carried out by the Berlin authorities said the sale to Daimler-Benz in mid-1990 of a 61,710 square metre property for DM92.8m (Pounds 32m) was well below the market value of DM179.7m. Daimler-Benz is understood to have offered an additional sum which is under study in Brussels. Mr Steffen Kammradt, spokesman for the Berlin Finance Ministry, said the city was notified yesterday by Bonn that the Commission will also look into the property sale to Sony to determine whether it received illegal subsidies. Sony bought the 30,000 square metre property for its German headquarters for DM97.2m in June 1991. The price per square metre was much higher than in the Daimler-Benz sale as German unification had taken place and Berlin was again the capital. Both of the prestigious investors were regarded by the city as vital for Berlin's future. Mr Eberhard Diepgen, the governing mayor, was also anxious to assure that Daimler-Benz suffered no 'loss of face' if the Commission ruled the cut-price sale amounted to illegal state aid. Daimler-Benz said the Commission's inquiry would not hold up the building plans for the headquarters of its service operations but that it wanted a decision from Brussels soon.</p>

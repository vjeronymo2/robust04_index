			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / International Company News: Saab Auto on the road to recovery - Chances for a turnround at the Swedish-US venture Saab Auto's 1991 results, to be announced today, will be better than most observers expect, says Mr David Herman, the company's American-born chief executive. But he is the first to admit Saab Auto has some way to go before it starts making an annual profit. 'If we can sell 100,000 cars this year, and the exchange rate is at SKr6.50 to the dollar, then we will be in profit,' he says. But in 1991 Saab sold only 87,500 units and its main markets - the US, Britain and Scandinavia - are where the recession is at its deepest. This year's sales outlook remains grim even if Saab is doing better than other foreign car-makers in the US market. Only a few days ago, the company announced temporary six-hours-a-week production cutbacks would continue until the end of April. Ever since early 1990, when Saab Auto was formed as a jointly-owned partnership between Saab-Scania and General Motors, it has been grappling with financial difficulties. In its first three months of trading, pre-tax losses were SKr995m (Dollars 166m), while for the whole of 1990 a deficit of SKr4.64bn almost wiped out the company's original SKr6.4bn equity capital. Mr Herman was compelled to shut down Saab's new SKr1.3bn assembly plant in Malmo, in southern Sweden, early last year. He also had to push through a tough rationalisation programme which will have cut the payroll by more than a third by the end of this year. By last autumn, the size of Saab's losses began to decline - with a SKr699m deficit in the second quarter of 1991 and a loss of SKr574m in the third quarter - despite flat sales and heavy start-up costs for the Saab 9000 CS model. The company was helped with a SKr5.5bn cash injection from its joint owners last June, while in the autumn Saab Auto raised Dollars 750m through a syndicated financing for its planned product and marketing developments in the 1990s. It has been an uphill struggle, however. A plain-speaking, though modest, man, Mr Herman was 'shocked' at what he saw in Saab's plants when he first arrived. 'I just could not see what everybody was doing. There were too many people with unclear work assignments,' he explains. Saab was also being crippled by a 25 per cent annual job turnover rate, and more than 10 per cent daily absenteeism among its blue-collar workers. Contrary to expectations, however, he did not march in and impose a GM management style on the company Instead, he sought to work with, and not against, the grain of Swedish labour practice. He focused on cutting costs and boosting productivity through greater efficiencies, turning Saab's independent work groups into teams with 'continuous training', and developing jobs with career prospects. Wage differentials based on merit and skill have been introduced. Managers are more integrated into the production process. Saab's performance has certainly improved. Productivity is up, with a cut in production time per car from 85 hours to 60 hours. This has brought Saab more into line with European levels of output, though it still lies far behind the 30 hours achieved in some Japanese plants. Staff turnover is down to 8 per cent a year and absenteeism to 5 per cent. Synergies in product development between Saab and GM, as well as joint sourcing of components and a merger of dealer networks in Sweden, is helping the company claw its way out of trouble. However Mr Herman remains cautions; 'I am not a saviour. It is the Swedes, not me, who have been making the changes.'</p>

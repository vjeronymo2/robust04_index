			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 8 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee  [C.C.] of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] gave a party on May  7 for the delegation of the Communist Party of India (Marxist)  on a visit to Korea.    Addressing the party, Secretary of the C.C., the WPK Hwang  Chang-yop highly appreciated the Communist Party of India  (Marxist) that is positively striving for the freedom and  emancipation of the Indian people, the peace and security of  Asia and the rest of the world and the cause of socialism, and  expressed firm solidarity for it.    "The current situation makes it incumbent upon the communist  and workers' parties to strengthen the bonds of international  solidarity and collectively confront the anti-socialist  offensives of the imperialists," he said, adding "the Workers'  Party of Korea will, in the future, too, direct positive efforts  to strengthening and developing the bonds of friendship and  solidarity with the Communist Party of India (Marxist)".    Head of the delegation Jyoti Basu, member of the Political  Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India  (Marxist) and prime minister of the West Bengal State, spoke at  the party.    Noting Korea, a bulwalk of socialism, is the beacon of the  world working class, he highly estimated the remarkable success  achieved by the Korean people in the socialist construction  under the guidance of respected Comrade Kim Il-song, the leader  of the world communist movement, and the Workers' Party of Korea.    Pointing out that the Korean people are advancing under the  uplifted banner of the chuche idea, he said:    Under the leadership of respected Comrade Kim Il-song and  dear Comrade Kim Chong-il, the Korean people are thoroughly  applying the principle of independence in politics,  self-supporting in economy and self-reliance in defence.    Friendly and fraternal relations are existing between the  Workers' Party of Korea and the Communist Party of India  (Marxist) and the party members of the Communist Party of India  (Marxist) are in high spirit over the socialism of Korea that is  making a stride forward.    The spearhead of aggression of imperialism is now directed  to  socialism, he said, noting any moves of the U.S. imperialists  can not bring the valiant revolutionaries of Korea to their  knees.    He denounced the U.S. imperialists' unjustifiable pressure  upon the Korean people with the fabrication of the "nuclear  issue" and expressed solidarity for the Korean people's  struggle, stressing that no one can check the advancement of  people towards socialism.</p>

			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VACANT CLEVELAND JOB DRAWS MANY INQUIRIES  </P> <P> Calls to the principal's office at Cleveland High came in a steady stream just  one day after basketball Coach Bob Braswell announced that he was leaving the  school to become an assistant at Cal State Long Beach.  </P> <P> Ida Mae Windham, Cleveland's principal, said the list of prospects was growing  fast Tuesday afternoon, and Braswell predicted that she would receive "100 more  calls."  </P> <P> Sandy Greentree, who guided Marshall High to the City Section 3-A Division  championship three years ago, was among the first to inquire about the vacant  position, Braswell said. Others reportedly interested are Washington High Coach  David Spirlin, Canoga Park Coach Jeff Davis and Calabasas High assistant Wayne  Fluker.  </P> <P> Fluker, a former Cal State Northridge graduate assistant, said he believes that  the chances are "pretty good" that he will succeed Braswell, his friend of five  years.  </P> <P> "At least in his mind, I'm the No. 1 candidate," Fluker said, referring to  Braswell. "Bobby knows the type of person that program needs. I'm sure his word  will influence her decision heavily."  </P> <P> Fluker was selected as basketball coach at Monroe High earlier this year but  was unable to accept the position because he had not secured a teaching  credential. Since then, he has received certification and has been teaching  physical education and health at Agoura High and coaching the junior varsity at  Calabasas.  </P> <P> Braswell is an English teacher, so a position is open in that department.  However, there are no openings for a P. E. instructor. Windham said that she is  working without a timetable for hiring a replacement.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Unified School District requires one-fourth of each school's  faculty to be composed of minorities, complicating Windham's task. Braswell,  who is black, said that the school is not currently in compliance with the  district guideline.  </P> <P> Whoever his successor is, Braswell is confident of one thing: Cleveland's  winning ways will continue, with guards Eddie Hill and Andre Chevalier and  forward Bobby McRae returning to form a solid nucleus next season.  </P> <P> "Whoever comes in should win 12 games, easy," he said. "You could put a dead  body on the bench and win 12 or 13 times with these guys."  </P> <P> Staff writer Steve Elling contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Soviet PM offers compromise THE Soviet Prime Minister said yesterday he was prepared to include in his government representatives of 'other movements' in an effort to 'broaden its social base'. The offer by Mr Valentin Pavlov at a plenary session of the the Communist Party central committee remained vague, but appeared to continue the momentum towards compromise in the Soviet Union. This movement began with an agreement to establish order and end the strikes which was signed by Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet President, Mr Boris Yeltsin, who heads the Russian Federation, and eight other Republican leaders. It received a further boost last night when Mr Alexander Dzasokhov, a Central Committee secretary, told a press conference after the two day plenary session that the Communist Party was in favour of a government which 'integrated into it representatives of the republics - so that new figures appear in the government'. He said the party's ruling body had expressed 'great satisfaction' at Mr Pavlov's statement, and that it was prepared for a 'widening of power'. At the same plenum, Mr Gorbachev made an emotional if ritual offer of resignation as Party general secretary after a trial by criticism from a number of conservative Central Committee members. The offer, like his others over the past two years, was immediately and heavily turned down by the party politburo. Mr Gorbachev has made full play of Tuesday's agreement with the republican leaders, arguing that it opened up a new period of reform. However, it appeared to have no immediate effect yesterday, as strikes continued in the main coalfields and in Belorussia. A token one-hour strike at the end of the working day, called by the democratic Russia movement and the Federation of Independent Trade Unions, is to go ahead today. Strikers in Minsk, the Belorussian capital, met in the city centre to demand an emergency session of the republic's Supreme Soviet - a demand which has so far been refused. Demonstrators in the city of Orsha were reported to be still blocking the town's railway station and threatening to block the transit of imports from the west. In Leningrad, metro construction workers and workers at the Kirov plant both threatened strike action - while the Soviet air traffic controllers have threatened strikes from May 21 if their demands for a tripling of their pay, together with part payment in hard currency, are not met. Mr Yeltsin defended his agreement with Mr Gorbachev before the Russian parliament yesterday, saying it was a 'great victory'. The statement recognised the sovereignty of the nine republics signing the statement, and the right of the six which do not wish to sign a new union treaty to leave the union. However his supporters, and strike leaders, expressed doubt and surprise over the agreement. Mr Lev Ponomaryov, a co-chairman of Democratic Russia, said that 'there are phrases in the agreement I dislike very much', instancing the call for an end to strikes. However, he also said that the agreement to hold elections for the Supreme Soviet by the end of the year was 'to a certain extent a fulfillment of the political demands of the miners'.

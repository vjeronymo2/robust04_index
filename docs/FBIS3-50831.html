Thousands of persons participated in the ceremony, including  several members of the Cuban leadership, with the obvious  exception of Fidel and his brother, Raul Castro, who is the  first vice president of the Council of Ministers and Minister of  the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba (FAR).    Such absences, particularly that of the chief of state,  caused surprise. Especially when some of Fidel Castro's  bodyguards were seen taking up positions in Ciudad Libertad,  formerly Columbia camp, which was the general headquarters of  the troops of Dictator Fulgencio Batista, who was defeated by  the Castroite guerrillas on 1 January 1959.    The media and government have thus far refrained from  explaining the absence. Some observers attributed it to the  fact that Castro delivered a speech last 1 January in Santiago  de Cuba (east) commemorating the revolutionary triumph.    On that occasion Castro reiterated his willingness to keep  Cuba on the socialist path and expressed his confidence for 1994  following the "most difficult year" ever experienced by the  regime since its emergence.    The Cuban revolution celebrates 1 January as the day when  Cubans began the year 1959 without Batista, who fled on 31  December for Santo Domingo. The guerrilla columns entered  Havana and Santiago the following day, 2 January, after the last  cells of military resistance surrendered.    Only Juan Contino, first secretary of the Union of Communist  Youths (UJC), spoke at the commemorative ceremony and insisted  on persevering in the socialist path.    Over the past few days Castro's epic event has been widely  commented on by the press, which has insistently cited a phrase  by the Cuban leader that is currently applicable: "Let's not  fool ourselves into thinking that everything will be easier from  now on. Perhaps everything will be more difficult."</p>

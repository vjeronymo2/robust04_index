			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Second bite urged at budget deficit PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is being urged to plan a second attack on the budget deficit after his current four-year reduction plan, in an attempt to restore competitiveness. The Competitiveness Policy Council, set up by Congress in 1990, yesterday called for elimination of the federal budget deficit by the year 2000 - or, even better, creation of a budget surplus - as an essential step towards freeing enough savings to finance an expansion in US investment. Mr Fred Bergsten, director of the Washington-based Institute for International Economics and the council's chairman, welcomed Mr Clinton's economic programme as a first bite at the problem; indeed, the Clinton plan draws in several areas on the council's work. 'We are saying he should have in mind that the first four-year tranche may not be enough.' In its second annual report, presented to Congress yesterday, the council, which groups leaders from business, labour, government and academia, calls for a central national goal of nearly tripling productivity growth, to at least 2 per cent a year, by the end of the century. That would require 'increasing national investment by at least 4-6 per cent of GDP, or about Dollars 300bn annually at current prices,' the report says, adding that 'most of the expansion must come from the private sector.' If this is to be financed internally, instead of by continuing to depend on foreign capital, the council argues, the national savings rate will have to rise by 5-7 per cent. 'Those are ambitious goals, but we think they are doable,' Mr Bergsten said. As some of the policies advocated by the council would involve increased spending, the report lists options for a future round of spending cuts and tax increases. The US current account deficit climbed back to Dollars 62.4bn last year, with an improved surplus on services partially offsetting a widening merchandise trade deficit and declining income from overseas investments.</p>

			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WEREN'T TRAFFIC PROBLEMS FORESEEN?  </P> <P> Gabe Fuentes' article, "Some Businesses Face Problems as Nordhoff St.  Straightens Out" (March 13) made me wonder why both the city in this case and  the state in the case of the Simi Valley Freeway are so shortsighted when it  comes to metropolitan transit.  </P> <P> According to Fuentes, the city has had rights to build the Nordhoff road  connection for 20 years. The problem cited for this lack of action was  insufficient funding. Now that funding has become available, construction has  begun, with a project completion date of sometime next summer. The city feels  that this will relieve traffic in the future, but for now inconvenience reigns  for area shoppers and residents. Something should have been done long ago,  before the problem arose!  </P> <P> Now direct your attention to the Simi Valley Freeway. At present, each  direction has three lanes, with the eastbound side allowing driving on the  inside shoulder during peak morning hours. It should be obvious to the state,  especially after underestimating traffic flow on both the San Diego Freeway and  the Ventura Freeway, that a freeway capable of handling more volume is  necessary to allow for future growth, without construction.  </P> <P> With Simi Valley's population of more than 100,000, it's obvious that expansion  is required, causing an inconvenience for thousands of motorists daily. Cost,  time and motorist inconvenience could be greatly cut if both the state and city  organizations looked a little bit more into the future.  </P> <P> TIM NELSON  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

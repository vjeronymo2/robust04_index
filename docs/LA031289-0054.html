			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DROWNING IN AMERICA, STARVING FOR CHINA;  </P> <P> THE JOY LUCK CLUB BY AMY TAN (G.P. PUTNAM'S SONS: $18.95; 277 PP.)  </P> <P> The only negative thing I could ever say about this book is that I'll never  again be able to read it for the first time. "The Joy Luck Club" is so  powerful, so full of magic, that by the end of the second paragraph, your heart  catches; by the end of the first page, tears blur your vision, and one-third of  the way down on Page 26, you know you won't be doing anything of importance  until you have finished this novel.  </P> <P> The main narrative here is taken up by Jing-mei Woo, a first-generation  American-Chinese woman whose whole tone is tuned to the fact that she is,  essentially, lost. She's swimming upstream in American culture, doing the best  she can, but she's gone through several jobs, she's gotten into the habit of  settling for less than she should, and her own Chinese mother appears to be  bitterly disappointed in her. Then, her mother dies, and Jing-mei is asked by  three old family friends to take her mother's place at their mah-jongg table,  at a social club they've been carrying on in San Francisco for the last 40  years.  </P> <P> Here is Jing-mei (who goes by the name of June, now), recording her first night  as a bona-fide member: "The Joy Luck Aunties are all wearing slacks, bright  print blouses, and different versions of sturdy walking shoes. We are all  seated around the dining room table under a lamp that looks like a Spanish  candelabra. Uncle George puts on his bifocals and starts the meeting by reading  the minutes. 'Our capital account is $24,825, or about $6,206 a couple, $3,103  a person. We sold Subaru for a loss at six and three quarters. We bought a  hundred shares of Smith International at seven. Our thanks to Lindo and Tinn  Jong for the goodies. The red bean soup was especially delicious. . . .' "  </P> <P> Not the stuff of high adventure. But the original Joy Luck Club was started in  Chungking during the last of World War II by Jing-mei's mother when she was a  young widow, literally setting herself and her friends the task of creating joy  and luck out of unimaginable catastrophe: "What was worse, we asked among  ourselves, to sit and wait for our own deaths with proper somber faces? or to  choose our own happiness? . . . We decided to hold parties and pretend each  week had become the new year. Each week we could forget past wrongs done to us.  We weren't allowed to think a bad thought. We feasted, we laughed, we played  games, lost and won, we told the best stories. And each week, we could hope to  be lucky."  </P> <P> The reason that the men in the present Joy Luck Club buy stock now is so that  every member can feel lucky and have some joy, because by this time it has  become unacceptable to lose anything more. The four women who have consoled  themselves in America for 40 years with friendship, mah-jongg and stories, have  already lived lives that are, again, unimaginable. On top of all their other  terrors and adversities, their pasts have been lost; as if these horrors have  taken place not just in another country but on another planet. Their deepest  wish is to pass their knowledge, their tales, on to their children, especially  to their daughters, but those young women are undergoing a slow death of their  own; drowning in American culture at the same time they starve for a past they  can never fully understand.  </P> <P> The author leavens this Angst with Marx brothers humor, making you laugh,  literally, even as you cry. What can you do with a Chinese couple who name  their four boys Matthew, Mark, Luke and Bing? What can you tell a mother who  thinks she's getting "so-so security" from the government, or (as Jing-mei  remembers her own mother deep in indignation about an irate neighbor who  believes that she's killed his cat) " ' . . . That man, he raise his hand like  this, show me his ugly fist and call me worst Fukien landlady. I not from  Fukien. Hunh! He know nothing!' "  </P> <P> But the misunderstandings don't come merely from vagaries of language. "The Joy  Luck Club" is about the way the past distances itself from the present as  speedily as a disappearing star on a "Star Trek" rerun. It's gone, gone, and  yet the past holds the only keys to meaning in every life examined here. On her  first night at the mah-jongg table, her mother's friends revealed to Jing-mei  that she has two half-sisters still in China, and that the Joy Luck ladies have  saved money so that she, Jing-mei, can go home to tell them about their mother.  " 'What can I tell them about my mother?' " Jing-mei blurts. " 'I don't know  anything . . . .' " But the book is dedicated by the author: "To my mother and  the memory of her mother. You asked me once what I would remember. This, and  much more." What results from this stunningly devotional tour de force is an  entrance into eight separate lives: four women whose "real" life occurred in  China, in another world, in another mind; and four of their daughters,  themselves grown women now. To say they are all products of conflicting value  systems is heavy-handed inaccuracy, wimpy paraphrase.  </P> <P> Here, for instance, is Eurasian Lena St. Clair, Ying-ying's daughter,  translating her mother's Chinese to her Caucasian father, after Ying-ying has  given birth to her stillborn baby brother: Lena's mother cries out " . . . Then  this baby, maybe he heard us, his large head seemed to fill with hot air and  rise up from the table. The head turned to one side. . . . It looked right  through me. I knew he could see everything inside me. How I had given no  thought to killing my other son!" Lena translates to her sad, ignorant father:  " . . . She thinks we must all think very hard about having another baby. . . .  And she thinks we should leave now and go have dinner.' "  </P> <P> And, 15 or so years later, it seems inevitable that Lena should end up with a  Hungarian "rice husband" (so named for all those Chinese "rice Christians" who  hung around missionaries in China simply so they could get a square meal). In  the name of feminism and right thinking, this husband is taking Lena for every  cent she's got, but she's so demoralized, so "out of balance" in the Chinese  sense, that she can't do a thing about it.  </P> <P> If, so far, I haven't done justice to this book, that's because you can't turn  a poem into prose, or explain magic, without destroying the magic, destroying  the poem. One can only mention scraps: The four mothers come from different  parts of (and times in) China, so for instance, the author allows us to see one  peasant mother, Lindo Jong, who remembers she was not worthless: "I looked and  smelled like a precious bun cake, sweet with a good clean color." Lindo,  betrothed at 2, wangles her way out of a horrible marriage with courage and  wit. But another mah-jongg lady, An-mei, has watched her own mother lose her  honor and "face" by becoming third concubine to a hideous merchant in Tiensing.  An-mei's mother times her suicide in such a way that her ghost can come back to  haunt the house on New Year's Day, thus insuring a good future for her child,  who, in turn, comes to America, has a daughter, Rose, who somehow rustles up  the courage to defy an American husband who's trying to swindle her. . . .  </P> <P> But the stories of the four mothers, the four daughters, are not really the  point here. "The Joy Luck Club" is dazzling because of the worlds it gives us:  When Lindo, old now, says, " 'Feel my bracelets. They must be 24 carats, pure  inside and out,' " if you have any sense at all, you let yourself be led down a  garden path into a whole other place; where a little girl in San Francisco  becomes chess champion at age 6 by using her mother's "invisible strength,"  where a woman who comes from the richest family in Wushi (with boxes of jade in  every room holding just the right amount of cigarettes) is given the name of  Betty by her dopey American husband, who doesn't know she's already "dead," a  "ghost. . . ."  </P> <P> At the perimeters of all these stories are all the men, buying and trading in  this Mountain of Gold, selling Subaru at a loss, each one of them with his own  story that has yet to be told. "The Joy Luck Club" has the disconcerting effect  of making you look at everyone in your own life with the -- however fleeting --  knowledge that they are locked in the spaceships of their own amazing stories.  Only magicians of language like Amy Tan hold the imaginative keys to the  isolating capsules. Which is why we have novels and novelists in the first  place.  </P></p>

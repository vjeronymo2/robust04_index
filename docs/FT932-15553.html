			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Spending at the European Bank: The bank that likes to say yes - to itself - The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has been one of the most imaginative initiatives taken by western nations in response to the economic and political turmoil brought about by the collapse of communism. But so far much of its money has been spent internally THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was set up in 1991 to help eastern Europe build on the ruins of communism with private investment. Two years later, as delegates attending next week's annual meeting in London will learn, the main beneficiaries of its largesse have been its staff, consultants, building contractors and aircraft leasing companies. It has provided considerably less in loans and investments to the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe than it has consumed on fitting out its London offices, paying salaries and meeting other overheads. Here are the facts: From April 15 1991 to the end of last year its total running costs, mainly salaries, travel costs and general overheads, have been Pounds 128m. Its budget for 1993, which is denominated in European Currency Units, is Ecu136m (Pounds 109m). It spent Pounds 18m of UK government funds on equipping its previous office, which it occupied for less than two years before moving to its new office block at Number One Exchange Square in the City last December. It is in the process of spending a further Pounds 55.5m on fitting out this building. By the end of last year it had disbursed only Ecu126m (Pounds 101m) in loans and investments to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. This is just half what it allocated to its buildings and its running costs in the same period. Some disparity between the costs of running the bank and the initial provision of finance to the region was inevitable. Start-up costs for any new institution are big and it was explicitly modelled on the World Bank, whose running costs are substantial. But the bank's intellectually dynamic founder and president Mr Jacques Attali, who for much of the 1980s was the special adviser to the French President, Mr Francois Mitterrand, admits that 'disbursement (of loans and investments) is amazingly slow in terms of our (original) forecast'. He adds, however: 'I would say it is a good thing, because it demonstrates that we are very cautious.' He says he would be facing considerable criticism from his shareholders - the leading industrial countries together with those of the former Eastern bloc - if the bank were being reckless in its investment policy. The bank also points out that it has stayed within its administrative and building budgets, which have all been approved by these shareholders, including Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, who is one of the bank's governors. Mr Attali's talents for designing grand schemes for the regeneration of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are not in doubt. But he is not by nature a financial controller or a chief executive. Two questions therefore suggest themselves concerning the execution of the bank's mission: Should the investment policy of the bank be loosened to facilitate a more rapid disbursement of funds? Does the budget-making process put enough pressure on the bank to keep its expenditure in check? Mr Attali appears to have inherited from Mr Mitterrand a passion for monumental architecture - the slabs of Carrara marble which frame the lifts in the lofty mirrored entrance may have been expensive, but the bank says they have great symbolic significance. A different kind of marble, Travertine, was originally installed. According to Mr Pierre Pissaloux, a former high-flying French civil servant who is the bank's budget director, this marble was inappropriate. So it was replaced by Carrara statuary slabs in various stages of polish, at a cost of Pounds 750,000. The point of the exercise, said Mr Pissaloux, was that the new marble represented what the EBRD was trying to do for people in eastern Europe  - 'changing them from something rough into something polished'. Mr Attali said he was not embarrassed by the bank's opulent offices. He said he had a 'duty to provide them (employees) with a very good environment' as compensation for the reduced pay they earn at the bank compared with what they could receive in the private sector. He also set a condition that the building cost should be 'below the average cost' of comparable projects in the City. Both arguments in favour of the building are questionable. Some of Mr Attali's colleagues came from the private sector, but most say they were lured by the challenge and excitement of changing the face of eastern Europe. They could probably earn more if they returned. However, the average EBRD salary - including secretaries and lower-grade staff - is Ecu58,300, high compared with most public-sector organisation but not by World Bank standards. EBRD employees do not pay UK taxes, thanks to the founding charter signed by the government. But the bank itself levies an 'income tax' averaging about 10 per cent which it uses to help finance its operations. The average salary is equivalent therefore to a UK gross salary of more than Pounds 65,000. Mr Attali is the highest paid employee, with a 1992 salary of Pounds 150,000 after deduction of the internal tax. Were he to pay UK taxes, this would be the equivalent of a gross salary of more than Pounds 240,000 - Pounds 75,000 more than the governor of the Bank of England received last year, Pounds 163,000 more than the prime minister and Pounds 40,000 less than the basic salary of the chairman of National Westminster Bank. Mr Attali has said he wants to waive the EBRD'S general pay rise of 5.5 per cent for the current year. The question of whether the Pounds 55.5m fitting-out cost is reasonable by City standards is more complicated. The UK government was desperate to attract the bank to London - it is the only leading international institution of its kind in the British capital - and provided Pounds 40m towards the costs of its offices. The bank spent Pounds 18m of this on its offices in Leadenhall Street - which it occupied for 20 months - and the balance of Pounds 22m is being spent on the new headquarters. The bank received an additional Pounds 250,000 grant from the Corporation of London. The building covers 403,000 sq ft in total. The cost of fitting out that space per sq ft is Pounds 138. Only 320,000 sq ft of that space is usable, however, which pushes the cost up to Pounds 173 per sq ft. Building consultants say that both figures are at the top end of normal fitting out costs. Mr Pissaloux disputed that judgment. The bank, he pointed out, had special needs, such as translation facilities for its annual meeting and conferences. If these special factors were excluded, he said, the cost per sq ft was Pounds 108. 'That is at the lower end of City fit-out costs,' he said. 'I am at ease with that.' Gleeds, the quantity surveyors, said that fitting-out costs for a large merchant bank's office would typically be about Pounds 70 per sq ft for gross space in a shell and core building (a building containing neither furnishings nor mechanical and electrical equipment). Mr Pissaloux also said that part of the building's cost had been met from saving rent due on the Leadenhall offices and by striking an advantageous deal with the building developer, Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments. By finishing work on its Exchange Square building ahead of schedule the bank was able to save six months' rental payments for Leadenhall. That rent saving was worth Pounds 6m, Mr Pissaloux said. In addition Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments, the building's developer, gave Pounds 9.5m towards the fitting-out costs, plus a rent-free period of two years and five months, which is worth Pounds 38m. Property agents said, however, that the deal with Rosehaugh was in line with market conditions at the time. 'When the EBRD was looking, the market was dead,' said a surveyor. 'Property companies were falling over themselves to deal with it.' The bank is paying Pounds 39.5 per sq ft, which is well below the peak rents paid for space in adjacent buildings in the late 1980s but well above today's prices for top-quality City space, which range between Pounds 25 and Pounds 35. Mr Pissaloux insisted: 'We got the best price at the time.' Mr Pissaloux also pointed out that there was a break in the lease after 15 years, allowing the bank either to move out or seek more attractive terms then. He was also proud of having secured a warranty which meant that the landlord had to pay for any structural defects which might emerge in the building over the next 12 years - which agents say is unusual. Staff moved to the new building just before Christmas and the move was celebrated with a party held at London's Grosvenor House Hotel. Mr Attali said the party's cost was 'very low'. In fact, it amounted to Pounds 52,000, Pounds 80 for each of the 650 employees or consultants who attended. The bank also argued that Mr Attali's regular use of rented private airplanes was value for money. Mr Attali said he used private jets on two sorts of occasions only: when he had to fit in a large number of meetings over a short period in many different countries (as happened quite frequently), or if his destination was not served by regular international flights (which was the case in many parts of the former Soviet Union). He spent Pounds 600,000 last year on private jets. Mr Pissaloux said that he had earmarked between Pounds 350,000 and Pounds 400,000 in this year's budget for between 15 and 18 trips by private jet - this comes to about Pounds 22,000 per flight. Mr Pissaloux stresses that all expenses were overseen by the bank's board of directors, who are government officials representing the 53 countries which are the bank's shareholders. Even the building costs had stayed within the special capital budget approved at the end of 1991. The main responsibilities of these directors is to approve loans, investments and spending. A series of board committees scrutinise salaries (the remuneration committee), the annual budgets (the finance committee) and the annual accounts (the audit committee). One director insisted that they were a tough independent force, whose aim was to ensure that the bank did not waste money. But, in the matter of their own remuneration, they were not independent from the EBRD. As Mr Attali said: 'It's a very strange system - we pay for them but they are representing their governments.' The directors, who are typically secondees from the shareholders' civil services, receive EBRD salaries and EBRD tax breaks. 'It's enormous pay compared to a normal civil servant,' said Mr Atalli. In 1992 the 23 directors, their 23 alternates and 23 secretaries, who occupy two floors of the bank's head office, were paid an average salary before the 10 per cent tax of Ecu87,000 each - equivalent to a UK gross salary of Pounds 100,000. It is arguable that if directors were paid directly by their governments they might exert tougher financial disciplines on the bank. The experience of private-sector companies also suggests that any board as big as the EBRD's will rarely have the cohesion to put significant pressure on executives.</p>

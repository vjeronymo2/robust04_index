			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Lev Ryabchikov for TASS] </F>   [Text] Simferopol 31 March, TASS -- The information working  group of the national movement of Crimean Tatars send telegrams  to the presidents of Crimea, Russia and Ukraine, as well as to  the mass media, labelling the 27 March elcections to the Crimean  parliament as "an act of outrage against the will of the Crimean  Tatars" which ensured cooperation of the kurultay-mejlis cohort  to the parliament.    Some 90 per cent of the voters in the Crimean Tatar ethnic  constituency cast their ballots for candidates from the  kurultay- mejlis, while the national movement of Crimean Tatars,  which is in opposition to the kurultay, managed to poll slightly  above 5 per cent of the votes. The telegram said this outcome  was prompted by the intensive treatment of the people by means  of the mass media, numerous violations of the voting procedure,  overt campaigning for kurultay candidates on the election day,  which is banned under law.    The leaders of the Crimean Tatars' movement assess the  election results as a plot against Ukraine, Russia and Crimea,  as well as the Crimean Tatars, the CIS, the world community, the  truth and justice.</p>

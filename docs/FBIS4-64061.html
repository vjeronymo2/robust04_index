			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By CRIME-TASS correspondent Olga Semionova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 27 TASS -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin told the collegium of the Federal Counterintelligence  Service (FCIS) on Thursday that he had sent to the State Duma  for approval the law on the Federal Counterintelligence Service  after endorsing it, the FCIS chief, Sergey Stepashin announced  at the continuing conference of the service leaders.    The passing of the law will strengthen the legal framework  which is now operating on the basis of the regulation signed by  the president in January.    While in the FCIS, Yeltsin proposed to restore the  investigative department to the service, which had been taken  away from it after the president had signed a decree in December  ordering the reorganization of the security agencies of the  Russian Federation. It has become clear since that time that the  move complicated the activity of the FCIS, as well as of the  prosecutor's office and the interior affairs agencies. They had  to investigate cases for which they had no adequate experience  and lacked appropriate support.</p>

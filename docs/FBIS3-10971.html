			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Venezuelan Enrique Ter Horst was confirmed today by  the UN Security Council as the UN representative and chief of  the UN Observers for El Salvador [Onusal] mission which will  have to take charge of the pending matters following the  elections. UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said that  it will be necessary to extend Onusal's mission after 31 May  when its mandate concludes. This is before the inauguration of  the government elected during the 20 March elections as there is  no prospect that by that date the peace agreements will be met.    UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali made reference to the  Salvadoran situation barely one week before the end of the  electoral process indicating that although there have been some  difficulties due to the delay in the delivery of voting  documents in former conflict ridden areas, Onusal is negotiating  with the authorities on the solution of this problem.</p>

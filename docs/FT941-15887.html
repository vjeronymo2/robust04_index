			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Balladur reignites education war: French school finance reforms France's historic tug-of-war between public and private education is about to be played out again in the streets of Paris, with a big protest planned for Sunday against the government's school finance reform. The only thing that will keep the number of demonstrators below the minimum 100,000 forecast by the interior ministry would be a decision by the country's constitutional council today or tomorrow to annul the reform, in response to the Socialist challenge that it unconstitutionally favours private (largely Roman Catholic) schools over public ones. By removing a 144-year-old limit on state funding of private school infrastructure late last year, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has re-ignited his country's ancient guerre scolaire. This has ended his period of calm cohabitation with President Francois Mitterrand who has taken up rhetorical cudgels in defence of state education, and also drawn more muted tactical criticism from his fellow Gaullist and presidential rival, Mr Jacques Chirac, and even some senior clerics such as the Archbishop of Lyon. Mr Balladur seems to have underestimated two factors giving fresh sensitivity to French educational policy. One is the seemingly endless rise in unemployment, which has made parents more worried than ever about any reduction in the resources deployed to prepare their children for a job. The other is that the desire of some Moslem immigrants for their daughters to wear traditional 'chador' scarves has seemed to many French to place their country's secular education system into question. In his new year's attempt to balance his reform with promises of more money for public schools, Mr Balladur is now trying to defuse what in the past has provide a political minefield - with repeated violent clashes in 1968, 1984 and 1986 over school and university reform. But he is unlikely to back-pedal entirely, even in the face of a flat Non from the constitutional court, given the pressure on him to redeem his coalition's election pledge to rationalise the remaining anomalies in French school finance. The most distinctive feature of modern French education is the deal which the French state struck with the Roman Catholic church in 1959. This appeared to end their long war, which saw the state first triumph over the church in the French revolution, then readmit some church schools in the 1850s, only to 'laicise' thoroughly education by the start of this century. To enlist the church's help in educating the 1950s baby boom, however, the de Gaulle government agreed to pay all the salaries and operating costs of any church school which signed a contract with the state commiting them to a syllabus and examination system set by the government. Such 'contract' Catholic schools must admit children of any religion. They can make reference to their religious philosophy, but must not impose it. Buoyed by this injection of state money - which brings basic monthly fees down to FFr30 (Pounds 3.50) for a primary school in the rural Vendee and to FFr150 for an urban technical school - 'contract' Catholic schools have blossomed. There are 9,500 of them, teaching some 2m, or 17 per cent, of the nation's children, and are particularly strong in the west, north and south-east. They hardly exist in Alsace, which missed out on the late 19th century 'laicisation' by being under German occupation and when it rejoined France in 1918 was allowed to keep its 1850s-style tolerance of religious education in public schools. Left unsettled, though, has been the issue of who pays for the schools' bricks and mortar. The 1850 law of a conservative education minister, Comte Frederic de Falloux - which the Balladur government has just amended - allowed local authorities to fund up to 10 per cent of regular private schools' infrastructure. However, full public funding was permitted for work on private technical schools in 1919 and for private agricultural schools in 1984. The latter concession is politically awkward for Mr Michel Rocard, who is now the Socialist party leader but who was agriculture minister in 1984. The Balladur government, and particularly Mr Francois Bayrou, the education minister and his UDF party which is especially attached to decentralisation, says the funding anomaly between private regular and specialist schools should be corrected and that local authorities should be able to use their money as they see fit. A government-commissioned report stated last month that half the country's private schools were in urgent need of repairs, whose cost it put in the range of FFr3.5bn-FFr5.3bn. However, in a time of budget squeeze, the Socialist opposition says this money will only come at the expense of public schools. Mr Henri Emmanuelli, a former Socialist president of the National Assembly, conjures up the worst of French fears by saying it will all lead 'to a British-style situation, with more and more delapidated public schools in a segregated, two-speed educational system'.</p>

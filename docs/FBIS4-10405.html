			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Daniel Dultzin Dubin, director </F> general of the multilateral negotiations in the Mexican Foreign  Relations Secretariat, by Jesus Aranda; place and date not given  -- all quotation marks as published]    [Text] Daniel Dultzin Dubin, director general of  multilateral negotiations in the Foreign Relations Secretariat,  has said that in the wake of Mexico's entry into the OECD, the  country will now have to make adjustments in several fundamental  economic areas.    According to Dultzin, included among the areas in which  Mexico is willing to make midterm and long-term adjustments is  maritime transportation. He also noted that, in general, all  environmental agreements are being carried out.    Modifications will have to be made in 38 economic areas,  including capital goods, services, environment, foreign  investments, multinational corporations, consumer protection  programs, agriculture, nuclear energy, and tourism. Other areas  that will need to undergo adjustment include financial markets,  fiscal issues, trade, employment and social issues, insurance,  scientific and technological policies, computer technology, data  processing and communications policies, development assistance,  and others.    Dultzin also mentioned areas such as education, in addition  to specific naval construction and steel agreements.    Although adopted agreements affect all of these areas, the  energy sector will not be affected because "we decided not to  participate in this area, and also, we did not participate in  developmental assistance or in independent agreements on  exports."    Other agreements are aimed at creating a more prosperous,  stable Mexican economy that will raise the people's standard of  living and increase employment, and all of these agreements "are  designed to improve the Mexican economy."    Daniel Dultzin explained that the adjustments really have  nothing to do with trade: "There is a Trade Committee that  thoroughly reviews international trade policies. If the OECD's  mission is to safeguard a multilateral trade system, they can  rely on the Uruguay Round of the GATT negotiations. This,  however, has nothing to do with the required adjustments on  issues such as trade deregulation or the granting of preferences.    "We are not about to lose our status as a developing  country;  our admittance into the OECD does not connote this. This is  something completely different; we are not going to lose this  status."    The SRE [Foreign Relations Secretariat] official explained:  "We have lost our concessional credits [creditos concesionales]  because our per capita income has surpassed the fixed $2,300  amount, and also because of the overall income level. In terms  of increases in our level of income, we will be losing some of  the advantages that come with being a poor country, or one in  development." At any rate, this will not take place just  because we are an OECD member.    On the contrary, the Basel Agreements between all of the  central banks imply government credits are rated as zero risk  for all OECD members. They fell from 100 to zero, but for the  commercial banks they will fall to 20. In other words, it is  expected that there will be an impact on the cost of what is  paid in premium for the credits Mexico acquires.    [Aranda] What can we expect from our admittance to the OECD?    [Dultzin] What we can expect is, first of all, to be  completely involved in all discussions of the more than 200  working groups and committees. Mexican officials will be  receiveing training in every area of government. The OECD  covers all areas of government except security, sports, and  culture.    In addition there will be "improved training and increased  coordination of programs in the interior, and, therefore, we  will be better informed, which in turn will allow us to better  apply new policies."    "We are gradually committing ourselves to offer  nondiscriminatory, fair treatment as long as economic conditions  in Mexico and the legal structure allow this. However, we also  expect to guarantee these liberties to all Mexicans living in  other countries. It is vital that the Mexican economy is  capable of globalizing. Of course, all of this depends on what  we might do."    [Aranda] Up until 31 December, there was a certain  perception  of Mexico abroad. Considering Colosio's murder, what support  can the OECD provide Mexico?    [Dultzin] All of the governments are well aware of the  problems we have had. They have decided not to modify the  discussions or the manner in which these are being carried out.  Our internal problems are our problems, and it is up to us to  resolve them. They have accepted us as a mature [maduro]  country confronting problems related to growing up. Maybe it is  a transition in our development process. We are being accepted  as a mature country by other mature countries.    "It will be up to us to resolve our problems as best we can.  However, the other nations are there, not so much to tell us  what to do, but to offer support and guidance, as well as to  help as much as possible because many of them have similar  problems."    [Aranda] The member-states have a democratic culture. Was  there any problem when you adopted the decision concerning  Mexico's admission?    [Dultzin] There are principles; these include a basic  philosophy, market economies, and economies that date back  hundreds of years. The relationship between states and markets  is very old. Democracy and respect for human rights are very old  principles and, obviously, they are essential to those countries  and to us, too. Within the OECD, there are various cases in  which various countries have faced very difficult political  situations.    "Mexico's pledge basically deals with human rights,  democracy, and a market economy that improves the people's  overall lifestyle and will become increasingly prosperous.  These are the principles we share. They do not touch on  political issues; they deal with other topics -- in depth and  vigorously.    Daniel Dultzin Dublin said Mexico's pledge is to strive for  a  better trained work force; a better adaptation of the labor  market to the need for more industrial services, greater  competitiveness, and productivity; and to include the working  class in the overall marketplace with a better lifestyle and  training.    [Aranda] The country faces uncertain times. What does the  admission to the OECD represent?    [Dultzin] Admission was scheduled for 24 March; the date was  established so the OECD Council could adopt a decision. It  adopted the decision despite all of the events that have  recently occurred in Mexico. The council was fully aware that  its decision was coming within a new context, but it  nevertheless adopted the decision as scheduled. The  confirmation and acceptance were planned for 14 April.    "It is an element of all of these countries' great  confidence  in Mexico, in its institutions, in the maturity of its society,  and in Mexican society's ability to face these problems and  overcome them. This can result in specific and mutual benefits,  and the OECD countries will be more aware of the problems that  afflict developing nations such as ours."    The director general of multilateral negotiations in the SRE  says OECD countries know what conditions prevail in Mexico:  "They know perfectly well how revenues are distributed and that  we are 5 percent above the median for the population with the  highest income -- a level in which Mexico is above the median  for industrialized countries. Some 20 percent of the low-income  population is way below the median for industrialized countries.  The general trend is for greater overall productivity and a  better distribution of wages."    Moveover, "very specialized work is being carried out on  regional development and rural development, which will give us  the experience to attack the poverty problem."    [Aranda] What topics interest Mexico the most as an OECD  member?    [Dultzin] There is one critical issue. In order to ensure  that economic development will be sustainable in the long run in  Mexico, higher growth levels must be compatible with reduced  inflation, price stability, and a sustainable external deficit.    "Also, everything dealing with the development of small and  medium-sized enterprises, their problems, and international  production tasks." [sentence as published] In addition, Mexico  is interested in "doing everything possible to incorporate an  underground economy, and this must be increasingly strengthened  through production chains, large companies, and large  distribution chains or their international counterparts, because  this will help us a great deal."    The official emphasizes it is essential for Mexico to have  much more access to international markets. "If this does not  happen, we will be inhibited in our development; we will not be  able to develop the Mexican economy's potential, which could be  around 5, 6, or 7 percent, and we will not be able to achieve an  in-depth solution to the problem of increasing our participation  in international markets with Mexican assets, services, and  experience. Mexican products are competitive, and they have a  market.    "It is an enormous challenge, but there are many topics  within the OECD that can help promote Mexico."    [Aranda] What other topics are important for Mexico?    [Dultzin] The basic problems that afflict large cities --  pollution, development, and urban planning -- as well as similar  problems dealing with regional development, more successful  agricultural policies, and assistance for the peasants. We can  find many areas in which we can improve our economy.    [Arenda] We have joined the APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation] organization, NAFTA, and the OECD. What next?    [Dultzin] Our admission does not guarantee we will fare  better. Mexico has maturity, knowledge, and experience that are  of interest to industrialized countries, as well as to East  European countries, where Mexico's experience may be of great  interest -- both our achievements and our backwardness, and what  we do with them -- and we can benefit from this. Mexico has  made a name for itself in the world community because it has  something to say, and it is capable of absorbing the experience  of others for its own benefit.</p>

The country's legislation should provide a common customs  duty but it should be implemented gradually to prevent a too  rapid unification of tariffs, said WB coordinator in Latvia,  Inguna Dobraja.    A WB mission worked in Riga last week and acquainted itself  with the local system of customs tariffs in view of introducing  a new model, Dobraja said.    WB experts suggested that Latvia promotes exports by  repaying  customs duty for exported goods which are made with imported  equipment and raw materials, Dobraja noted.    The WB mission toured the Riga trade port, the Riga airport  and a customs checkpoint to study the local conditions.    The mission will prepare a detailed survey on the results of  the visit. But they already noticed that Latvia needs to  improve the customs bookkeeping and revise the mechanism of  collecting customs duties.    The customs duties should be collected through non-cash  accounting to avoid corruption, the WB specialists said.    The next WB mission will continue to study the Latvian  customs late in April.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with People's Deputy of Ukraine Oleksandr Moroz </F> by Anatoliy Kraslyanskyy; place and date not given: "Oleksandr  Moroz: Pick Grain by Grain, And You Will Have Bread"]    [Text] There is no need to introduce People's Deputy  of Ukraine Oleksandr Moroz--he is a well-known politician. We  asked him to share his thoughts on the eve of opening the first  session of the Supreme Council 13th term.    [Kraslyanskyy] Oleksandr Oleksandrovich, you are, as they  say, not a novice in the Supreme Council, since you were a  member in the previous term and have now been elected a people's  deputy of Ukraine for the second time. What would you like to  reject of the things associated with the previous Supreme  Council, what would you like to preserve, and what would you  like to add in order for it to work successfully?    [Moroz] Of the creative achievements of the Supreme Council,  I would take the level of political professionalism, which last  year began to acquire clearer shape. I feel that when the  deputies worked on concrete legislative acts, they put aside  ideological disagreements and the knowledge acquired over four  years of deputy experience began to work. We really have gone  through a great school of learning, and it would be imprudent to  disregard it.    The work of the previous Supreme Council, however, was  replete with shortcomings, and they need to be consigned to  history. For instance, we have to discard the system of  lawmaking. The answer to the question recently asked by the then  Prime Minister L. Kuchma--what we are building?--needed to be  given back in 1990, at least after the all-Ukraine referendum.  Had we such an answer, in its content we should have worked out  the structure and sequence of steps in adopting laws. Then the  commission on questions of legislation and legality, as well as  other commissions, could function in accordance with a clear  program. One of the deputies of the Supreme Council chairman  should have put together a sort of a schedule of preparation of  laws and "monitor the progress" of each law from conception to  adoption and control over its "life." There was no such system.  The process of lawmaking itself was chaotic, and this became one  of the reasons that the laws did not correlate with one another;  they lacked financial and scientific substantiation, and a  forecast of the consequences of their action in society.    One more thing. If we know what people themselves want to  say  regarding preservation in the constitution, for instance, of  social guarantees regarding work, free education, and so on,  then why do we disregard citizens' feelings? Why do we act  against the will of the people? Is this democracy? Is this a  proper position for the supreme organ of authority? The new  parliament should develop an institute of lawmaking. It does not  have to be necessarily a staff structure--it can be a small  group of organizers-scholars, jurists, who would form a creative  group and develop a system of making concrete laws, perhaps  through a competition.    [Kraslyanskyy] In the beginning of our conversation you  mentioned the subject of ideological disagreements. Judging by  the composition of the current parliament, it will also  certainly have plenty of such disagreements. How do you see  overcoming them? Finally, with whom are you going to join forces  and with whom will you seek compromise?    [Moroz] One can never make the Supreme Council free of  ideological discussion--this simply would be against its nature.  The point is to make it a mere addition to lawmaking work in the  parliament.    [Kraslyanskyy] In principle, law in itself is ideology...    [Moroz] Undoubtedly. We understand very well that politics  is  relations between people and the corresponding spheres in the  state that are regulated by laws or other normative acts.    As to unproductive political clashes within parliament  walls,  much depends in this respect on the organization of the Supreme  Council's work, on the formation of its governing structures,  the order in which they will consider those draft laws and  questions that concern people most today. Knowing their mood, I  will say that current economic problems concern people more than  anything. Speaking of contentions of individual politicians that  the fault for all the troubles lies with the communists, who  allegedly are in power even now, you may rest assured: People  have figured out today who is who, who defended the versions of  privatization that made the plunder of Ukraine possible. Here is  economics and politics for you all at once. Knowing these  circumstances, realizing that we have to climb out of the pit  into which we have fallen, and giving the commissions some or  other laws that deal with economic problems for consideration, I  think that along this road we will have fewer ideological  battles, since a concrete cause demands concrete action, and for  the sake of it one can put aside irreconcilable views.    As soon as we start moving in the direction of economic  stabilization and people start feeling that the crisis is  subsiding, then the intensity of issues will diminish  considerably.    [Kraslyanskyy] A logical question: Do you see a way of  extricating Ukraine from its difficult economic situation?    [Moroz] Today this is the most difficult question for  anyone.  The Supreme Council apparently must first resolve the main  problem on this path: forming a capable, competent, decisive  government. I know this is not easy. But Ukraine has never had  its own government--a government of a state. Ukraine has not had  and still does not have its own economy. It is still not treated  by our executive authority as a single organism. We need to find  in the state a first person who will measure up to this task, be  able to get a grip on the situation as a whole.    [Kraslyanskyy] Do you have a candidate in mind?    [Moroz] There are various proposals and options. Without  naming any persons in particular, I will only say that in this  matter we need to resolutely reject strictly ideological  criteria. This has already done great harm to our economy.  Today, of course, there are many who are regretful, while  perhaps some are rejoicing, carrying out someone's instructions,  that this has happened, but it is true that since the fall of  1990 every new government has been weaker than the previous one.  From a political viewpoint perhaps it would be unsuitable to  turn to the specialists of the past, but I would step over all  these nuances for the sake of having good professionals in the  Cabinet of Ministers. Although usually new people, new  approaches, and a fresh team generate faster hope and confidence  in the authorities. There are options. And we are not talking  here about a return to the command-administrative system.    Thus, to start with it is necessary to form in the Cabinet  of  Ministers a team that will understand all these tasks and  nuances and will not strive to turn to the methods of leadership  that have already brought great harm to our economy. At the same  time, power structures need to resolutely rid themselves of  corruption and abuse, and repulse anyone's desire to profit from  others' misfortunes. On the other hand, they need to create  conditions so as to eliminate the possibility of engaging in  dirty business in the corridors of power. And one more thing.  Labor can be effective only when economic incentives begin to  work instead of compulsory forms of state orders or detailed  planning.    At the same time I think that at the macrolevel the state  sector of the economy must have clear leadership. And we see  that current economic management is being conducted in such a  way that the state sector is being destroyed, consistently and  purposefully. Already about 20 percent of the means of  production at state enterprises has been privatized. They  somehow still operate, agonize, but at the same time produce the  main part of the gross output. The state sector has been placed  in mortal circumstances; it is being deliberately strangled and  destroyed.    [Kraslyanskyy] Judging by everything, you now support a  change of authority, the creation of conditions that would put  an end to the chaos and, as you put it, abuse and  irresponsibility. Would it be correct to say that in this  current difficult period you support a restoration of the  dictatorship of authority?    [Moroz] I am for the dictatorship of order. And in this  respect it is not necessary to bring dictatorship to  authoritarian methods of organizing the authority. What I mean  is that everyone and everything should be subordinate to the  law, and that the latter should deal ruthlessly with whoever  attempts to violate it. For this we have to build up the  structure of power. I am convinced that the Council, which in  one form or another exists all over the world as the mechanism  of authority, presents great opportunities for establishing  order.    [Kraslyanskyy] So, Oleksandr Oleksandrovich, which form of  authority do you support: parliamentary,  parliamentary-presidential, or presidential?    [Moroz] For the current stage of development of Ukrainian  statehood I think the most suitable form of authority is  parliamentary-presidential. Although in the future, when the  situation in the economy stabilizes and society emerges from  cataclysm onto a straight road, we could do with a parliamentary  republic.    [Kraslyanskyy] I disagree with you in this respect. Knowing  the character traits of our people, their eternal striving for  Cossack freedom, where each is his own master, I think that  broad democracy in the form of a parliamentary republic may turn  into all-out anarchy and harm our statehood. And did you not  yourself feel at the time of the election campaign that people  want a strong authority concentrated in the hands of one person?    [Moroz] I think what people want is order and confidence in  tomorrow. They are not looking for salvation in a hetman or a  tsar. They are searching first of all for a way to realize their  labor potential. When we create motivation for labor, people  will respect both the law and the state.    [Kraslyanskyy] I would like to finish the conversation where  we started. Which is: Although the new parliament has not  convened yet, to my knowledge deputy factions have already been  practically formed. You head one of them. With whom are you  planning to work, and with whom to reach compromises?    [Moroz] Regarding leadership of a faction--thank you. This  is  news to me. And differentiation is indeed emerging. As to  compromises, I will say this: It depends on the purpose and for  the sake of what a compromise is being sought. If it is for the  fulfillment of the task I consider to be the most  important--overcoming the economic catastrophe--I am ready to  work with anyone. What is currently needed is action instead of  quarreling; we need to find the rational in different positions.  As they say, pick grain by grain, and you will have bread.</p>

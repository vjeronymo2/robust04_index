			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Serba, member of the Council of Experts </F> for Cossack Affairs under the Ministry for Nationalities Affairs  and Regional Policy, under the rubric "Position": "The State  Duma Has Not Yet Started on the Cossacks Issue: The Cossacks Are  Shifting Their Interest to Regional Power Structures"]    [Text] The Cossacks had barely asserted themselves as a  public movement as they rushed to establish contacts with the  legislative organs of the then USSR. This was only natural:  Their desire to restore the Cossacks' use of land and the  hetmens' self-rule as well as the formation of a Cossack unit in  the army had to find support in the appropriate legal acts.  Plans for the future included the creation of a professionally  trained group of Cossack deputies who would defend the Cossacks'  interests under the complicated political and ethnic situation  emerging in Cossack regions, mostly in the Kuban, Terek, and  North Kazakhstan.    The board of the Cossack Union, which was the first mass  Cossack organization created in the USSR, set its stake on the  USSR Supreme Soviet and put immense effort into its work with  deputies from the Cossack regions. These attempts were not  successful, however. Kuban was represented in the Supreme Soviet  by the ill-famed Ivan Polozkov; other Cossack regions were  represented by just as incongruous local party leaders. The  Cossack Union could not "delight" the Cossacks with any single  act that would have anything to do with them, not even an act on  their rehabilitation.    Hardly any more success was achieved in the highest  legislative organs by another public Cossack organization, the  newly restored Union of Russian Cossack Troops, which had been  eliminated by the Bolsheviks. Unlike the Cossack Union, it  managed to establish contacts with the Russian parliament. It  used a new approach in coordinating its activities with the  leaders of those political parties and deputy associations whose  policy in one field or another corresponded with Cossack  interests. An attempt to set up a group of Cossack deputies who  would work to restore the Cossack status met with no success.    The lack of any significant results shown by the Cossack  Union and the Union of Russian Cossack Troops in their work in  the highest legislative organs of both the former USSR and the  Russian Federation caused a certain disappointment in them among  the Cossacks, who shifted their attention to the regional power  structures. The 70-year-old pronouncement of Don hetman Kaledin  that "The healing of Russia should start with the outlying  areas" has been spread widely; whether it is appropriate or not,  people keep quoting a statement by Novosiltsev, a contemporary  member of the Union of Cossack Troops: "Given the current  situation, it is impossible to form any state power in Russia.  Power should be established in the provinces, in the oblasts,  and from there it should spread to the center and then settle."    Most of the Cossack leaders came to the latest elections  with  this idea of creating a strong local power which would become  the Cossacks' ally. As a result, the votes of many millions of  Cossacks supported a large variety of parties and election  blocs, from Russia's Choice to the communists. The support of  the Cossack voters was quite considerable and some of the  Cossack hetmen have joined regional representative bodies (some  of them were even elected to the Russian State Duma). This  allowed the local Cossack organizations to resolve some critical  issues, mostly legal or economic in nature. However, the  emergence of these "Duma Cossacks" did not do anything for the  Cossack community of Russia as a whole. They were elected from  various "non-Cossack" parties and blocs and, being promoted by  one or another structure that financed their election, these  deputies, instead of working for the Cossacks, had to "pay back"  by working for those who had financed their successful election  campaigns and ensured them victory over the other candidates.    Three months have passed since the State Duma started work,  but nothing has been uttered from its podium yet about the  situation of the Cossacks on the Terek or in North Kazakhstan,  or about the threat of ethic and social explosions in the Kuban  and Don. Nothing was said either about any mechanism allowing  implementation of presidential edicts on Cossack  self-administration and use of land, or about correlating these  edicts with legislation on Cossacks' federal service. In order  to change the situation, the Cossacks may act as an independent  force at elections to all-Russian representative bodies and  produce their own socioeconomic program. One must also remember  that the Cossack movement is well organized and its participants  are socially active and disciplined (the percentage of voting  Cossacks is much higher usually than the same figure for other  sections of the population). But the weakness of the Cossack  movement lies in its lack of unity, in the absence of accord  among its leaders. The hetmen of various Cossack units and  unions cannot come to a mutual understanding, are unable to  design a mutually acceptable pre-election program. Therefore,  the total number of Cossacks proclaims only its potential  possibilities, but not its realistic strength.    One of the strong points of the Cossack movement is the fact  that it is scattered over the entire territory of Russia and  represents all social strata of our society. The Cossacks enjoy  more popularity with people from other locations in non-Cossack  areas. The reason for this lies on the surface: Other residents  of Cossack regions are concerned about violations of their  rights and therefore observe the Cossack movement with  apprehension; but residents of "non-Cossack" territories do not  have the same emotions and view the idea of restoring the  Cossack status with more objectivity. Thus, the three Cossack  propagandists from the Cossack association in Moscow managed to  collect more signatures in Novgorod Oblast for support of Don  hetman Kaledin than the Cossacks of the Kuban and Orenburg areas  taken together. The result of propaganda may be a lot more  effective in other areas, for instance, the north of Russia and  the subpolar region, which have large numbers of descendants of  the repressed Cossacks. During the election campaign the  Cossacks may move outside their traditional regions and  transform the entire territory of Russia into their field of  action.    But in order to achieve any success in the pre-election  struggle, the ultimate goal set for the Cossack movement should  be other than a fight for privileges. Only in this case can the  Cossacks realistically count on the support of the Cossack  population. The Cossack movement does not have any well-known  leaders on the all-Russia scale. It should rely on the  provisions of its program but not on the popularity of certain  "leaders" who bore us on TV. It should prove that a strong  Cossack movement is needed for the purpose of reviving all  Russia and establishing its army.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Hammerson nails a deal There is a topsy-turvy feel to the property market at this stage in the recovery. Shares are trading at premiums to asset values; capital values are rising sharply while rents are still falling; and British Land and Hammerson are buying assets from institutional investors when most property companies would normally expect to sell to them. Still, both Hammerson and PosTel have reason to be pleased with their deal. By swapping a bundle of properties for Hammerson shares, PosTel is increasing its stake in a geared recovery stock from 1.2 per cent to 12.3 per cent. PosTel will eventually be able liquidate those shares more easily than property. Hammerson is in effect buying short-term earnings, which is useful given the strain of maintaining its dividend. Thereafter, it should be able to lift the initial yield of 7.6 per cent through more active management and redevelopment. But by marking Hammerson's shares down 2 per cent, the market focused more on the puzzling movements in its asset values rather than the attractions of the deal. It is hard to understand how Hammerson's US assets could have dropped 42 per cent over the year. The 5 per cent rise in Hammeron's UK retail assets also appears meagre given the significant shift in capital values elsewhere. Property investors must hope that reflects more on the ambitious valuations previously attached to Hammerson's portfolio rather than any cooling of the market overall.</p>

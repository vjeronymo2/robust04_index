			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Anthony Bevins report on the results of a Telephone poll </F> conducted for THE OBSERVER by ICM in Britain: "Eighty Per Cent  Reject Referendum on Single Currency"]    [Text] A Referendum on a single European currency, the  issue that divided the Tory leadership last week, is supported  by only a fifth of the electorate, an OBSERVER/ICM  [International Communications and Marketing Research] poll  suggests today.    Three times as many people wanted a referendum on further  constitutional change in the European Union [EU] -- the subject  for discussion at the next intergovernmental European conference  in 1996.    That left 60 per cent in favour of a constitutional  referendum, compared with 21 per cent favouring a referendum on  a single currency, due to be introduced by other EU states from  1999.    When ICM asked people whether they would be more or less  likely to vote Labour if it made a firm commitment to a single  currency, nearly half said they would be less likely to do so,  while 18 per cent would be more likely. A quarter said it would  make no difference.    The most marked antipathy towards a single currency, on the  basis of that question, was shown by Conservative supporters,  but even 58 per cent of Liberal Democrats said it would make  them less likely to vote Labour. compared with only 38 per cent  of existing Labour supporters.    The stronger support of Labour voters for Europe was also  shown when those interviewed were asked whether they would be  more or less likely to vote Labour if the party made a firm  commitment to closer political integration. Among Labour  voters, that question scored a positive rating of eight points  (34 per cent more likely to vote Labour; 26 per cent less  likely).    While the overall negative rating was 31 points on the  single  currency question, that fell to a negative rating of only nine  points on closer political integration, with 29 per cent more  likely to vote Labour; 38 per cent less likely.    That ambivalence became more pronounced when ICM asked  whether people would be more or less likely to vote Labour if it  made a firm commitment to halt any further shift of sovereignty  from Westminster to Brussels: 35 per cent said more likely, 35  per cent less likely, and 23 per cent that it would make no  difference.    With the European parliamentary elections taking place on 9  June, the debate between the Government and the Opposition  parties revolves around two questions -- the public hostility  towards Brussels centralisation, and the fear of being left  behind in the second division of a two tier European Union.    The Conservative campaign centres on the charge that Labour  favours socialist centralisation, while Labour argues that the  Tories will opt into the second division.    ICM asked: "If all members of the European Union cannot  agree to a timetable for economic and political integration, do  you think those willing to proceed should go ahead anyway, or  should all countries proceed together even if it means slowing  down the process?"    While a fifth (21 per cent) said those willing to go ahead  should do so, almost three-quarters (73 per cent) preferred a  united, slower pace -- compared with just over a half (56 per  cent) when the same question was put in October 1992. That  increase in the fear of isolation could help Labour when the  Conservatives are playing up John Major's Maastricht opt-outs,  and senior Tories are mooting withdrawal or use of the veto to  block further integration -- a move that could lead to a  two-tier development.    But when people were asked whether further economic and  political integration should be accelerated or slowed down, 63  per cent wanted it slowed down, while 23 per cent wanted it  accelerated -- an eight point increase on the 15 per cent  wanting acceleration in October 1992.</p>

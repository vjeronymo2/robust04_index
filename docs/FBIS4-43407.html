			<p>BFN     [Text] Asked to comment on a REUTER report last night that  the governments of European Union states may ask the Twelve to  take action if they believe the Turkish side is continuing to  obstruct progress in the confidence-building measures,  government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the Cypriot  Government thinks that sanctions are one way to end the Turkish  side's intransigence. Referring to the sanctions, the  government spokesman said the most important measure is an  embargo against the pseudostate's illegal exports, an issue on  which a European Court decision is still pending.</p>

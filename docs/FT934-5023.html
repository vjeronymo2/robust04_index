			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Pension tax rules targeted Tax rules for approved pension schemes are to change. One aim is to make personal pension scheme annuities taxable on the same basis as pensions paid by occupational pension schemes. Another is to improve arrangements for monitoring tax affairs of occupational pension schemes to ensure that the conditions on which tax reliefs are given continue to be met. The government also wants to remove a requirement for the Inland Revenue to approve the form of certain annuity contracts before they can be marketed to occupational pension schemes by insurance companies. The Revenue said yesterday that the purpose of the changes was to improve the operation of the tax regime for approved pension schemes. At the moment, annuities paid by approved personal pension schemes are treated as annual payments, so that basic-rate income tax is deducted from each instalment. For some people on small incomes too much tax is deducted and they have to reclaim the tax overpaid. Mr Clarke intends to change the basis of the charge for those annuities from Schedule D to Schedule E, bringing them within the PAYE system and allowing the correct amount of tax to be deducted from each annuity payment.</p>

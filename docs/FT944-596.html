			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Short-term pain, long-term gain - Serious Money The bungled devaluation in Mexico is a salutary reminder that emerging stock markets are intrinsically risky. What makes the lesson particularly hurtful for Western investors is that Mexico has been regarded widely as relatively stable. This - and the fact that US investors find Mexico comfortingly familiar - helped make it a major beneficiary of the recent flood of western money into the stock markets of the developing economies of south-east Asia and South America. When the emerging markets' bubble was pricked by the rise in US interest rates in February, all markets suffered, although the pain was not spread equally. The recovery has been equally patchy. But, generally, Latin American markets have tended to do better than the Asian ones which led the charge in 1993. Few British investors are likely to have a large proportion of their total investment portfolios in Mexico. But even a broadly-spread emerging markets trust has done well to make much headway this year: a sharp contrast with the glory days of 1993. Do not despair. The argument that investors from mature western economies should have a stake in more dynamic economies remains compelling. But it is a long-term strategy. If you cannot bear the short-term upsets, do not look. ***** Super-active investors hate holidays. Deprived of their second by second fix of stock market information, they loiter palely until the markets re-open. Do not let them make you feel guilty. Over-activity is one of the curses of the investing classes. Warren Buffett, the well-known American investor, points out that high turnover is better for brokers than for investors, adding: 'Investors should understand that what is good for the croupier is not good for the customer. A hyperactive stock market is the pick-pocket of enterprise.' Buffett gives a simplified example of a company which earns 12 per cent a year. He then assumes that the whole of the capital changes hands once each year, and that there is a 1 per cent commission levy on both buyers and sellers. So, in aggregate, the owners pay 2 per cent a year for the privilege of buying and selling the shares to each other. In other words, investors' excessive activity is subjecting their earnings to a voluntary annual tax of 16 2/3 per cent - and that is just the cost of buying and selling the shares. If you employ a financial adviser to tell you when to buy and sell, your total additional 'tax' will be even higher. Or, as Buffett puts it: 'Investors' penchant for financial flip-flopping also lands them with investment management charges for chair-changing advice.' Of course, if all your flip-flops are profitable ones, you can afford the costs. But it is a hefty 'if'. Most successful investors think hard before they make an investment decision and expect to stick with it for a long time. Personal investors who put money directly into shares and make their own decisions can imitate the masters. But, increasingly, the system is loaded against personal investors who rely on professional advisers. Say you ask a commission-based financial adviser to handle your unit trust portfolio. You are likely to pay an initial charge of between 3 per cent and 6 per cent (to cover the 3 per cent agent's commission) and 1.5 per cent a year afterwards (of which half a per cent goes to the agent). This does not sound extortionate - but it could eat up a third of your investment over the next 20 years. And it takes no account of the 'tax' imposed on the funds already by the costs of buying and selling the actual shares. Perhaps it is time to remember another Buffett suggestion. 'By periodically investing in an index fund, the know-nothing investor can actually out-perform most investment professionals. Paradoxically, when 'dumb' money acknowledges its limitations, it ceases to be dumb.' ***** Only 19 new names have signed up to join the Lloyd's insurance market next year; 2,652 are pulling out. For contrarians, this could signal that now is the time to take a plunge. On second thoughts, given that it's Lloyd's, keep the padlock on your wallet. ***** 'The salary of the chief executive of the large corporation is not a market award for achievement. It is frequently in the nature of a warm personal gesture by the individual to himself.' This quote from JK Galbraith comes from Matthew Parris's anthology Scorn.</p>

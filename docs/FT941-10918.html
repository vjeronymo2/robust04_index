			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (9): Manipulators targeted - Thailand Ekamol Kiriwat, head of Thailand's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), was only half joking when he explained recently how Thai stock manipulators had developed their use of bogus nominees to influence share prices: 'They used to use their drivers,' he said. 'Now they use their golf caddies.' The rapid expansion of the 19-year-old Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET)  - more than 360 companies and mutual funds are now quoted and volume on a busy day exceeds Dollars 1bn - has been accompanied by a fair share of volatility and insider trading. The Thai market, however, remains popular with foreign investors. Active and wealthy local speculators ensure that most stocks are liquid, the disclosure of financial information by Thai companies has improved, and foreign currency transfers in and out of Thailand have been simplified. Recognising the need for greater regulation, the Thai authorities established the SEC in 1992. Under Mr Ekamol, the SEC has taken the pragmatic view that it cannot hope to abolish all insider trading overnight and should concentrate on eliminating deliberate, large-scale conspiracies to create false markets in particular shares. The SEC has fingered three groups of alleged share manipulators since it was founded, and although no-one has yet been convicted (such convictions are hard to achieve even in developed markets) the SEC's vigilance has embarrassed the accused and helped to cool the speculative fever in Bangkok's trading rooms. Foreign investors have learned to cope with share-ramping; when the word is out in Bangkok that such and such a stock will rise, they are happy to buy shares which they themselves believe to be ridiculously overvalued on fundamentals (and then sell the stock quickly). Of more concern to foreign investors is the future of Thailand's foreign ownership limits. Foreign ownership is restricted under a variety of laws, usually to less than 50 per cent but to 25 per cent in the case of banks. Such restrictions create 'foreign premiums' when certain stocks - Bangkok Bank for example - reach their foreign ownership limits; in other words the price of the 'foreign' share rises above the price of the 'local' share in the same company. As in other countries with foreign limits, the possibility that limits might soon be eased in line with Thailand's financial liberalisation policy has caused volatility in premiums. The problem is complicated by the fact that many foreigners do own 'local' shares through nominees. This is a grey area, but it is supposed to be illegal to pass on dividends or rights to someone not registered as the beneficial owner of the shares. At least one custodian bank continues to pass on such dividends via nominees to foreign holders, but others have decided not to, although they are prepared to hold the stock itself. Most US institutional investors shun 'local' shares in any case, because their internal rules prevent them buying stock without voting rights. The dangers were highlighted recently when some foreign holders of shares in National Finance and Securities were denied access to a rights issue by their custodian and saw the value of their investment in the company halved overnight. Foreign investors are thus faced with a dilemma: if they buy 'foreign' shares, they risk losing money if the premium falls; if they buy 'local' shares, they risk losing dividends and rights. Only the 80 per cent rise in the value of Thai shares since June last year makes these dangers bearable. Thailand is considering a system of so-called Mexican trusts, which would allow foreigners to buy 'local' shares, without voting rights, through the trusts. However, the lack of voting rights would still be unacceptable to US institutions, and the establishment of the trusts might still cause a drop in foreign premiums as non-US investors moved from the foreign board to the trusts.</p>

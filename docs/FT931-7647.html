			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: Tremors follow Showa Shell's futures shock - The problem was that companies could defer settlement of contracts THE calm that pervades the offices of Showa Shell Sekiyu, the Japanese oil refiner and distributer 50 per cent owned by Royal Dutch/Shell, belies the shock that ran through Japanese industry on hearing at the weekend that it had incurred an estimated Y125bn (Dollars 1.05bn) in losses on foreign exchange futures contracts. Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry responded with criticism of Showa Shell's currency dealings and by asking other Japanese oil companies whether they were involved in similar transactions. Mr Yuji Tanahashi, vice-minister of trade, said it was regrettable that a leading Japanese company had posted a huge latent loss by engaging in foreign currency speculation without the knowledge of top management. Shares in Showa Shell fell Y300 yesterday, the maximum daily fall allowed under Japanese rules, as investors calculated the long-term consequences. Depending on how far the yen appreciates, its losses could rise to Y160bn. What has shocked the Japanese, apart from the scale of the losses, was how they were accumulated over four years without the knowledge of anyone outside the small group of staff involved in Showa Shell's foreign currency dealings. Mr Takeshi Henmi, the company's president, explained at the weekend that a small group of staff at the company's treasury department, who were responsible for foreign exchange trading, began placing forward contracts to buy the US dollar in 1989 on speculation that it would rise against the yen. However, the dollar failed to rise. Rather than settle the contracts at a loss, the group rolled over the contracts in the hope that eventually the dollar would move in its favour, or at least limit its losses. The average exchange rate at which the group placed buy orders was Y145 a dollar, while the yen rose to about Y125 at the end of last year. Since then, it has appreciated further to Y116.85 at yesterday's close in Tokyo. What made it easy for the group to keep knowledge of the dealings from the company's management was its ability to roll over, or postpone, the futures contracts indefinitely. That is, instead of paying for the dollars they agreed to buy, the group continued to postpone settlement of its contracts over several years. Another factor which helped conceal the accumulated losses was the fact that, under Japanese accounting rules, companies are not required to disclose unrealised losses in their annual figures. Since the losses at Showa Shell have not actually been incurred, they have not been reported in any of its accounts. On those occasions over the four years when the dollar came close to Y145 the group at Showa Shell was able to reduce its losses to some extent. In the event, however, the yen's rise against the dollar proved too large to combat. With latent accumulated losses amounting to about 82 per cent of the company's capital of Y153bn, the group was left with little choice but to go public. The company is conducting an internal investigation. But it has made clear that the group of staff involved was in breach of internal company rules on foreign currency dealings and would be disciplined. The ministries of both trade and finance would like to portray the development as an isolated case. But the extent of the losses, together with the fact that they did not surface for so long, raises questions about the wisdom of allowing companies to roll over currency futures contracts for an indefinite period. Last July, in an attempt to bring Japanese foreign exchange dealing practices more into line with those in the rest of the world, Japan's Federation of Bankers Associations agreed that banks should not allow companies to roll over futures contracts without specific business reasons for doing so. The Finance Ministry takes the view that the risks of foreign currency transactions are a matter for individual banks and companies to deal with and are not a matter for the ministry to meddle in. Nonetheless, it is said to have warned Japanese banks of the risks involved in allowing companies to postpone settlement of their futures contracts - widespread practice until recently, according to industry sources. Showa Shell expects to cover its losses over a period of 2 1/2 to three years by selling assets, including stocks and property. The company has emphasised that it will not cut the Y8 annual dividend, but the scale of the losses is expected to keep it under considerable strain for some time to come.</p>

Chokechai Aksaranan, president of  the Federation of Thai Industries, said the move would directly  benefit Thai business. The fact that Thailand and Vietnam are  geographically close will help transport of goods such as  consumer products and construction materials which Vietnam wants  very much, he said. Thailand will be in the most advantageous  position to be a springboard for investment in Vietnam.    Mr Chokechai expects more Thai investors to seek joint  ventures with Americans to invest in Vietnam because of the  United States' higher technology.    A Thai Petrochemical Industry Co executive, Prachai  Leophairatana, said the lifting of the embargo, if it occurred,  would greatly expand business in Vietnam because of the flood of  foreign capital into that country. The end of the sanctions  will enable new investors to enter Vietnam and this will be a  good time for Thai businessmen to sell their products.    As Mr Prachai is in the petrochemical industry dealing with  plastic and cement, he noted that this would be a good chance to  sell building materials to Vietnam. In supplying construction  materials such as cement, the country with the best advantage  will be the nearest because transport of the commodity costs a  lot.    In the short term, Thai investors will be in a better  position than others, but in the long run, if Thai investors do  not adapt, they will be disadvantaged particularly in terms of  competition in marketing and technology, he said.    Thirachit Satirotwong, a member of the Federation of Thai  Industries, said Thai businessmen had prepared for a long time  and sent several teams to explore investment opportunities in  Vietnam. He expects more investment if the embargo is lifted.    A United Gommunication Industry (UCOM) executive, who  declined to be named, said that UCOM recently approached  Vietnamese authorities to join an iridium project to link  Indochina with the rest of the world.    Vietnam had agreed but could not join officially because of  the embargo, he said. The lifting of the embargo will clear the  way for Vietnam to take part.    The $3.3-billion iridium system is a worldwide, digital,  satellite-based cellular personal communications system designed  mainly to provide commercial and governmental links through  mobile phones within a country and abroad. He said sole agents  of American products in the region, particularly in Thailand,  would directly benefit from the lifting of sanctions.    As most American products have Thais as their sole agents in  the region, particularly telecommunications products, their  markets will expand.    Although competition is expected from Hong Kong and  Singapore  agents for American products, the early dominance of Thais in  the Vietnamese market will be an advantage.    Americans would not directly invest in Vietnam for reasons  of  history, he believes. Also, the size of the market is not  large, about 60 million, and most people are poor. Business  would probably be done through barter. Rigid regulations on  money transactions would not attract American investors, he said.</p>

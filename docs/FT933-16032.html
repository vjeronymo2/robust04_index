			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Observer: Yung love The winds of change blowing through China have reached the byways of East Sussex. Larry Yung, the seriously rich son of Rong Yiren, China's vice-president, has bought his first English country estate. He has snapped up Harold Macmillan's old family home of Birch Grove. It is not known what Yung plans to do with the 14-bedroom mansion which has entertained statesmen ranging from Dwight Eisenhower and John Kennedy to Charles de Gaulle and Nikita Kruschev. But he should not feel too out of place if he chooses to move in. After all, the eldest son of China's multi-millionaire vice-president was born in the back of a Rolls Royce on the way to hospital in Shanghai. Sadly for Yung, the 1949 Chinese revolution - or 'liberation' as the Communists' like to call it - interrupted his family's high life. But, since arriving in Hong Kong in 1978, he has made up for it. He has built up the local branch of China International Trust and Investment Company into one of the colony's leading conglomerates, and is now acquiring all the necessary trappings of a taipan.</p>

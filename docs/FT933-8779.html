			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Greenalls in Pounds 3.5m drinks buy GREENALLS GROUP, the pub retailer and hotelier, has acquired JP O'Brien, a Lancashire-based drinks wholesaler, for Pounds 3.5m, comprising 650,000 Greenalls shares, loan stock of Pounds 700,000, and the balance in cash. O'Brien had turnover last year of Pounds 10m. Mr Andrew Thomas, Greenalls' chairman, said yesterday that the deal would increase the group's focus on wholesaling opportunities outside its own pub estate. 'Our existing wholesaling business will merge with O'Brien's and the resulting increase in scale will improve margins and increase its attraction to suppliers', he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Vladimir Taranov and </F> Boris Krivoshey]    [Text] Moscow April 7 TASS -- The Moscow round of talks  between the Tajik Government and anti-government opposition is  proceeding in calm and businesslike atmosphere. Both  negotiating teams demonstrate a constructive attitude towards  problems tackled by the talks, spokesman for the Russian Foreign  Ministry Grigoriy Karasin told a briefing on Thursday.    Nobody is under illusion that the current Tajik negotiations  will immediately disentangle all knots, which is to take  strained and ponderous efforts. Some recent reports by the mass  media are based on off-the-record statements and do not tend to  create a favourable atmosphere at the talks, the Foreign  Ministry spokesman noted.    Participants in the Moscow round of Tajik talks agreed to  refrain from hasty and comments. Only well-considered official  reports will be provided to newsmen. Relations with the press  will be coordinated by Piris-Ballon [name as received], the U.N.  secretary general's special envoy for peace settlement in  Tajikistan, Karasin told reporters.</p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / A deal snatched from under the giant's nose Mr Eric Nicoli, chief executive of United Biscuits, was quick to acknowledge yesterday that, however compelling the logic of the proposed CCA snacks deal, it required particularly deft selling to a stock market unnerved by recent reverses in UB's fortunes, writes Guy de Jonquieres. 'We are well aware that a strategic initiative at this time, when the performance of other parts of the business isn't optimised, raises all kinds of questions in the investment community,' he said. Mr Nicoli and his colleagues were ready with two answers. First, UB was making good progress in tackling the problems at Keebler, its US biscuits and snacks subsidiary, which led to a 17 per cent fall in the group's first-half profits. Keebler's sales during the second half-year, which began in July, were up 8 per cent, it had regained half its lost market share and profits were on course for a recovery. The second answer was blunter. The CCA deal was an unrepeatable opportunity to establish an Asian-Pacific bridgehead. 'The timing is entirely a matter of availability - we had to take it now,' Mr Nicoli said. UB has snatched CCA from under the nose of PepsiCo, the US soft drinks company, with which it is engaged in a worldwide race for market share. PepsiCo's annual snacks sales of almost Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn) are about four times greater than UB's. However, the CCA deal means UB can claim to be bigger than its US rival in the two markets where growth is fastest - Asia Pacific and Europe. Valued at roughly 12 times CCA snack business's annual cash flow, the price of the acquisition compares favourably with recent international food industry deals. There is also a neat fit with UB's existing businesses. The deal will strengthen UB's position in Italy and give it a plant in Germany. CCA's scattered Asian businesses also complement UB's outposts in China, Hong Kong and the Philippines. The restricted overlap limits the scope for recouping the purchase price through rationalisation. Profits growth will depend mainly on expanding sales. UB plans to restructure the management of its KP snacks division. CCA's European operations will be merged with KP's continental businesses, while management in Australia will take responsibility for all snacks operations in the Asia-Pacific region. In the near-term, UB aims to increase volumes by adding its existing products to CCA's range in Australia. However, the full promise of the deal will be realised only if it unlocks the potential of emerging Asian markets. Though some are growing rapidly, all except Japan are still quite small. According to Mr David Hearn, managing director of KP, the company's near-term approach will be 'a question of planting seeds and waiting'. But if UB is to maintain its early lead, it will need at some stage to make substantial investments to develop these markets. The company also faces a waiting game nearer home, particularly in Germany, Europe's second largest snacks market after Britain, which is dominated by Bahlsen and Convent, both privately owned companies. For the foreseeable future UB is resigned to playing a marginal role in Germany, but consoles itself with the thought that PepsiCo is in the same position. 'Neither we nor PepsiCo will break into Germany without buying one of the two local manufacturers,' says Mr Hearn. 'The play is to wait until one of them becomes available.'</p>

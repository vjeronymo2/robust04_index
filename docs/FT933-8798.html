			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Failure pays ONE OF THE yardsticks against which top people's remuneration packages should be judged is whether the directors feel the pinch when the company underperforms. Yet a study this week from Incomes Data Services confirms once again that the balance between risk and reward in the typical executive contract is all too often weighed in favour of the director against the company and its shareholders. Not only do executives on the usual three-year rolling contracts leave with an average of two years' pay in their pockets regardless of performance; many also take away other perks, including cars and compensation for expected bonus payments. Worse, the size of the pay-off often bears an inverse relation to merit because companies base the settlement on a calculation of what a law court might award, taking into account the director's re-employment prospects. Thus, the more public and egregious the person's failure, the lower the chances of a new job and the higher the settlement. Not all who leave have done anything wrong. Contracts are often broken because the job has ceased to exist or the company has been taken over. But even in these cases a two-year pay-off seems excessive, as most senior executives get new jobs five months after losing their old one. Supporters of three-year rolling contracts argue that legally enforceable tenure encourages continuity in the boardroom and prevents managers from taking short term decisions. But this does not square with the real world. Directors of Marks &amp; Spencer, P &amp; O and Abbey National, to name but three less than obvious short termists, do not have rolling contracts of more than a year. A second argument is that good managers are in short supply and will only move if they are promised security. Yet it is hard to believe that the really scarce managers are the ones who need this kind of security, let alone the reassurance that they will be disproportionately rewarded if they fail. The best way to ensure commitment for the long term is to tie the overall pay package to long-term performance. The simple answer to the contract dilemma is to make one-year contracts the norm. Postel, which manages the pension fund investments of British Telecom and the Post Office, has already applied pressure to larger British companies on this score - and to good effect. The terms on which the new chief executive of Booker was hired took into account Postel's requirements. But the chain of accountability from management to shareholder still has weak links. Better disclosure of remuneration, severance and pension packages would help institutional shareholders apply pressure where it is most needed.</p>

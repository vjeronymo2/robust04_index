			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Ljubljana DELO in Slovene of 5 April on  page 2 carries a report by Vladimir Vodusek about personnel  changes in the Defense Ministry and various military services  following the dismissal of the former Defense Minister Janez  Jansa, which the author sees as the beginning "of the  disbandment of the Moris special brigade and the intensive  banishment of Jansa's influence in the army."    As is reported, Tone Krkovic, commander of the special  brigade Moris, and Darko Njavro, deputy security commander of  the Moris special brigade, were relieved of their posts.  Vodusek writes that these changes took place before the inquiry  commission produced its final report about the incident in  Depala Vas, which resulted in Jansa's ousting.    Although Krkovic proposed Boris Mikuz as his replacement,  Vodusek writes, ``[new Defense Minister] Jelko Kacin decided for  Vojko Pavlin from the Moste Polje training center, who was until  the July war the commander of the Ljubljana province, and was,  together with Miha Butara, replaced by Janez Slapar. The new  commander will probably set up an entirely new office of  assistants. In political circles, one could have detected, for  quite some time, plans to reduce the numerical and striking  power of the special brigade, which also got its epilogue in the  accusations about the coup, the replacement of Janez Jansa, the  dismissal of Anton Krkovic, and the stripping of Darko Njavro's  authority.    "Beside Tone Krkovic, both [defense] state secretaries  Franci  Znidarsic and Gorazd Vidrih offered their resignations. Jelko  Kacin did not accept the resignation of Albin Gutman, commander  of the republican Territorial Defense Headquarters, although one  could have noticed from the media that he `allegedly stood too  much to the side' in the Smolnikar case. On the other hand,  government adviser Miran Bogataj, who took over the internal  investigation of Milan Smolnikar's arrest and in the  [parliamentary] commissions supposedly advocated Janez Jansa too  openly while did not identify with the views of the Liberal  Demoracts enough, will be promoted to a state secretary."    As the article says further, Milan Zver, the chief of  Jansa's  cabinet, and press representative Nika Dolinar are also leaving  the Defense Ministry and so is Maja Stojnic, who is in charge of  the international liaison.    "Big surprise are the rumors that the hitherto chief of the  Government Information Bureau Mile Setinc would become the head  of the military security service [VOMO]. Dusan Mikus, as a  moderate professional agent, is probably really not the must  suitable man for the potential use of VOMO for political  purposes, however the military intelligence service is, amidst  the general chaos, the only satisfactory constant in the  intelligence sphere," Vodusek writes.</p>

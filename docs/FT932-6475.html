			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Property leasing changes proposed THE DEPARTMENT of the Environment yesterday published a consultation paper on commercial property leases, which could lead to far-reaching changes in the UK property industry, Vanessa Houlder writes. The government is seeking responses to a number of possible changes, including the prohibition of upward-only rent review clauses, the prohibition of confidentiality clauses and establishment of a body to arbitrate disputed rent reviews. Responses to the proposals are sought by September 30. The decision to issue a consultation paper follows widespread criticism of commercial leases by tenants. They say that practices such as upward-only reviews and confidentiality clauses have favoured landlords over tenants and increased recessionary pressures on their businesses. Significant government intervention in commercial leases would be opposed by landlords, however. They believe it could cut property values and deter development. The government has said it does not intend legislating in any way to alter the terms in existing contracts.</p>

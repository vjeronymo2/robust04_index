			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / International Company News: Drexel rump sold for Dollars 600m The DBL Liquidating Trust, handling the disposal of what is left of the defunct investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert, announced yesterday it was selling New Street Capital, the successor firm to Drexel, to an Atlanta investment group, and liquidating its portfolio of mostly junk bond securities. The Trust said it expected to realise more than Dollars 600m from the sale of the Drexel assets, of which Dollars 209m will come from Green Capital, the Atlanta firm buying the on-going business of New Street, a small merchant bank with 24 staff. The remainder will come from the sale of New Street's securities portfolio, which consists primarily of junk bonds. The proceeds will be used to pay the holders of Drexel warrants, who will receive a total of about Dollars 21m, and the investment bank's creditors. A spokesman said it had yet to be decided how the funds from the sale of New Street securities will be distributed among Drexel's creditors. The disposals represent virtually the final chapter in the story of Drexel. Under the junk bond king Mr Michael Milken, the firm became one of Wall Street's premier investment banks during the 1980s, before the collapse of the junk bond market dragged it into bankruptcy. Mr Milken served 22 months in a federal prison for violations of securities laws. After the deals, all that will remain will be a portfolio of illiquid high-yield securities, estimated to be worth no more than Dollars 30m.</p>

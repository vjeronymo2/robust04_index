			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Sofia, June 23 (BTA) -- Today was the second  day of the visit of Admiral William Owens, vice chairman of the  U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff. He visited the International Bank  for Investment and Development and met with Foreign Minister  Stanislav Daskalov, Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov, the  leaders of the parliamentary National Security Committee and  President Zhelyu Zhelev. The bilateral relations, Bulgaria's  participation in the Partnership for Peace initiative and the  crisis in the former Yugoslavia were the key issues on the  agenda. Admiral Owens is visiting here at the invitation of the  Defence Ministry and the General Staff of the Bulgarian Army.  He delivered a lecture at the Atlantic Club.    President Zhelev elaborated on Bulgaria's position of  non-interference in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia and  non- participation in the peacekeeping forces there. It is  skeptical about the participation of Turkish "blue helmets."  There is transparency about Bulgaria's relations with its  neighbours Greece and Turkey, the military sphere included, he  said. In his opinion, however, Bulgaria is in a difficult  position because of the lack of balance in the region, Greece  and Turkey being much better armed. [passage omitted]    Defence Secretary William Perry will arrive here July 18,  Admiral Owens said.    Mr. Daskalov familiarized Admiral Owens with the progress in  the development of an individual cooperation programme and  emphasized the significance that Bulgaria attributes to its  long-term relations with NATO, Foreign Ministry spokesman Radko  Vlaykov reported. They both praised UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Force] for preventing the expansion of the conflict.    Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov thanked for the chance  given to Bulgarian officers to study in U.S. military schools.  He said Bulgaria was hoping to have at least one battalion  armed according to NATO standards, so that Bulgaria can take  part in UN peacekeeping missions.    The leaders of the Parliamentary National Security Committee  pointed out the political forces' consensus on Bulgaria's  integration with the European and Euro-Atlantic structures, the  parliamentary press office reported. They pointed out that  Bulgaria needs more guarantees for its national security from  its Western partners.    At the International Bank for Investment and Development  Admiral Owens was familiarized with the progress of business  contacts between Bulgarian and U.S. groups. This bank is the  first Bulgarian-U.S. joint venture in the banking sphere in  which the Bulgarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Parmont  Capital Investments have equal shares.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, May 23 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese  official in Hong Kong said today that China expects to resolve  the overall financing for the Hong Kong new airport at an early  date.    A settlement of the financial issue will help speed up  construction on the airport projects, said Zhang Junsheng,  deputy director of the XINHUA News Agency Hong Kong branch,  after attending the opening ceremony of a Chinese trade fair  here today.    The Chinese side has stated its opinion at the Sino-British  Airport Committee meeting last week and expected the British  side to give it a careful consideration, he said.    Both sides should accord with the memorandum of  understanding  on the construction of the Hong Kong new airport and reach an  agreement on the financial plan, he added.    China has always supported the construction of an airport in  Hong Kong and hopes to see it completed in time and up to  quality, he said, adding that China is not responsible for the  delay of the airport construction.</p>

			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DRUG CLINIC: COPING WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE IN SCHOOL  </P> <P> Question: I am a case worker in a statewide system for treating troubled  students. Presently I'm working with about 40 students who are hard-core  truants. They are constantly in behavioral trouble -- in and out of the school  system -- and come from the academically lowest-achieving school in our system.  </P> <P> When I approached the school principal about this problem, the principal --  backed by the administration -- told us not to ask these students any questions  about drugs or alcohol. He said, "These areas are personal, and parents won't  like it. Besides, there are no drug or alcohol problems in our school."  </P> <P> Do you have any suggestions on how to overcome these barriers?  </P> <P> Answer: First, here are two givens: (1) Every school, every industry and every  community has alcohol/drug problems. It's only a question of how extensive the  problems are. (2) Clinically, adults and adolescents who have significant  alcohol or drug problems also have trouble with their behavior and performance  in school, at work or at play.  </P> <P> Based on my clinical work with overseas schools as well as with public and  private schools in this country, I would say that the principal and the  administration in your town are playing politics, probably in order to protect  their jobs. The more sinister possibility is that the principal in question has  an alcohol/drug problem himself, or in his family.  </P> <P> In my clinical experience I have found that in schools where alcohol/drug  problems are rampant, one or more of the following situations exist:  </P> <P>  -- Substance abuse problems among top officials of the school administration.  </P> <P>  -- Widespread substance abuse among faculty members. (When I ask in such a  school how many recovering alcohol/drug abusers there are among the school  faculty, I get blank hostile stares, and the answer "zero." That tells me that  the teachers who are addicts in that school are still sick.)  </P> <P>  -- The school has no substance abuse program at all, or the program exists  only on paper.  </P> <P> Your community is not unique. Recently the principal of a New York City public  school was arrested while buying crack. He had been suspended three times  before by the school board because of unexplained absences and late appearances  at the school, but he had not been disciplined or removed.  </P> <P> When the media printed a news story about the principal's arrest, New York  City's school chancellor criticized the press and described his errant  principal as "a principal who unfortunately made a bad decision about the use  of crack."  </P> <P> When the news caught the attention of Mayor Edward Koch, he ordered an  investigation that revealed that the principal had become a troubled drinker  about three years before and was often observed drunk and dozing at meetings;  that he was late or absent 142 days out of 184 school days last year; that  one-fourth of the teaching staff was regularly late or absent; and that the  school's reading levels were among the lowest in the city, ranking 529th out of  616 elementary schools last year. The principal has since enrolled in a drug  treatment program.  </P> <P> What can be done to overcome the problem in your community? As a professional,  you have an obligation to treat your clients by using the latest effective,  accepted techniques available. If you counsel troubled students, getting a  drug/alcohol history, not only of your client but also of your client's family,  is of utmost clinical importance.  </P> <P> You must also discuss the school principal's advice with your own boss. If your  boss sides with the principal, maybe your mayor will want to look further into  this problem.  </P></p>

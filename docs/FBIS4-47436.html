			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S.Yu. Safarov, M.A., prof., and M.A. Aliyev, </F> Chair of Surgery, Stomatologic and Pediatric Faculties, Dagestan  Medical Institute, Makhachkala]    [Abstract] Clinical trials were conducted with porcine  splenic homogenates in the management of infected wounds on 30  patients, for comparison with a control group of 30 patients  treated in conventional manner. The outcome demonstrated the  efficacy of 2-5 applications of the homogenate: patients in the  experimental group were discharged from the hospital on an  average of 13.0 +/- 0.1 days earlier than the control subjects.  Cytologic and bacteriological workups demonstrated that in the  experimental group pus disappeared within an average of 3.0 +/-  0.1 days and granulation tissue appeared in 4.0 +/- 0.4 days,  whereas in the control group analogous manifestations required  9.0 +/- 0.4 and 8.1 +/- 0.2 days, respectively. In general, the  effects were attributed to absorptive capacity of the  homogenates for bacteria, their metabolites and cell detritus,  as well as anti-inflammatory factors.

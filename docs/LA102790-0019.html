			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LET GIBSON LEAVE AND GET STRAWBERRY  </P> <P> What must we faithful Dodger fans do to get Darryl Strawberry dressed in blue?  I read he wants to come to the Dodgers and then I heard it from his own mouth  on television. Surely the Dodger front office can come up with a solution that  will make Strawberry, the Dodgers and the fans extremely happy in 1991.  </P> <P> LYNDA M. GALLUP  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

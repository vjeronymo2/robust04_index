			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Session Resolution No. 7-18c of the Kazan City Soviet of </F> People's Deputies, Dated 19 May 1994": "On the Course of  Implementation of the 'Package of Urgent Measures To Fight Crime  in Kazan for 1993-1995'"]    [Text] The Standing Commission of the Kazan City Soviet of  People's Deputies on Observance of Legality, Protection of  Citizens' Rights, and Safeguarding of Law and Order and the city  administration have examined matters concerning the course of  implementation of the "Package of Urgent Measures To Fight  Crime" on a systematic basis.    The adoption in May 1993 of the Tatarstan Republic Law on  Emergency Measures To Fight Crime has enabled us to concentrate  efforts on the implementation of measures used in the fight  against crime. To achieve this end, R839.7 million was allocated  from the city budget and rayon budgets in 1993. Some 79  additional vehicles and means of individual protection were  acquired for the city militia. The Sovetskiy Rayon Internal  Affairs Directorate building was put into operation. Efforts  continue to institute supplementary militia divisions and  provide them organizational staffing and equipment. The  numerical strength of the Kazan Garrison increased by 1,200  individuals last year, enabling our law enforcement organs to  carry out their duties in the intensified operating mode. In  addition, it is planned this year to allocate more than R2.5  billion to law enforcement activity.    The Tatarstan Republic Law on Emergency Measures To Fight  Crime has been an important factor in improving the crime  situation in the city of Kazan.    Energetic efforts by the criminal-militia services are being  directed against the "authorities" of the criminal world  suspected of having committed grave crimes. Forces of the Kazan  Militia Garrison have conducted inspections, jointly with the  Tax Inspectorate, of commercial structures controlled by various  criminal groups. About 500 violations of various kinds--from tax  evasion to the sale of spurious alcoholic beverages--were  uncovered. In all instances, measures were undertaken to file  appropriate charges against the violators in accordance with the  law.    Implementation of the Law on Emergency Measures To Fight  Crime have enabled us to put a halt to the growth of crime.  According to 1993 results, the level of crime in the city  decreased 5.0 percent (from 22,209 to 21,074). Over the first  four months of this year, crime was reduced 9.8 percent from the  level observed during the same period of last year, while the  number of crimes solved increased by 20 percent.    At the same time, analysis of the program's implementation  shows that there have been a number of defects in its execution.  Development of a system of private investigative agencies is not  reflected in the package of urgent measures. Some grave crimes,  including crimes against the individual, remain unsolved.  Personnel turnover in the Kazan Militia Garrison is such as to  have an effect on the overall growth of professional skills and  the state of official discipline.    Inadequate attention is being devoted to the prevention of  crimes committed by intoxicated persons and juvenile delinquents.    There is no system for publishing and distributing law  enforcement literature for the populace. A number of issues  pertaining to public education and health care remain unresolved.    Regulation is lacking with respect to the kiosks, stores,  and  other places where alcoholic beverages are sold. A number of  these are located in direct proximity to children's and  educational institutions.    Proceeding from the above statements, the Kazan City Soviet  of People's Deputies RESOLVES:    1. To take into consideration the information on the course  of implementation of the "Package of Urgent Measures To Fight  Crime for 1993-1995."    2. That the head of administration of the city of Kazan  (K.Sh. Iskhakov) shall continue its efforts to further implement  the "Package of Urgent Measures To Fight Crime in Kazan for  1993-1995," taking into account the proposals and observations  expressed by deputies in session of the city soviet of people's  deputies.    3. That the Standing Commission for Observance of Legality,  Legal Protection of Citizens, and Safeguarding of Law and Order  shall:    3.1. Continue to monitor execution of the "Package of Urgent  Measures To Fight Crime in Kazan for 1993-1995."    3.2. Develop and submit for ratification by the presidium,  jointly with the city administration, measures for  implementation of the proposals and observations expressed  during discussion of the issue in question.    4. To ask the Tatarstan Republic Supreme Soviet to extend  the  term of effectiveness of the Law on Urgent Measures To Fight  Crime, prior to adoption of legislative acts by the Russian  Federation to intensify measures in the fight against crime.    4.1. To present an initiative to the State Duma of the  Russian Federation on adopting a law to stiffen liability for  carjacking, racket operations, and theft of personal property.    5. That the chief of the Internal Affairs Directorate of the  City of Kazan administration (N.G. Akbarov) shall ensure that  militia personnel comply with provisions of the law in the  execution of their official duties.    5.1. To direct that additional proposals be drawn up on the  establishment of a system providing operational communications  between citizens of the city and organs of the militia.    6. Responsibility for the course of implementation of this  resolution is entrusted to Deputy Chairman of the City Soviet  N.N. Rybushkin.    [Signed] Chairman K.Sh. Iskhakov</p>

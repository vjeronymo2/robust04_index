			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Citing a lack of evidence, a Colombian judge dropped charges against two  reputed leaders of the Medellin drug cartel accused in the assassination of  Colombia's attorney general and a kidnaping, a leading Bogota newspaper  reported. The two -- Pablo Escobar and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha -- are being  sought by U.S. authorities. The judge's action in Colombia apparently would not  prevent their extradition. Meanwhile, in Washington, the White House announced  that Colombian President Virgilio Barco Vargas will meet with President Bush on  Thursday on his way to New York to address the United Nations.  </P></p>

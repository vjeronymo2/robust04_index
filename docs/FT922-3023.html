			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Executing a will I AM the executor of a husband's simple will. Everything, including properties in the sole name of the husband, is left to his wife. My responsibility is to transfer all to the wife. There are three properties which have been occupied by relatives for many years, tax free and rent free. The wife does not wish to become involved with the two properties. She wants to gift them to the occupants. After obtaining probate, can I transfer the two properties direct out of the estate under the wife's instructions? If I can do this: 1) Should I use the normal transfer form to convey Title? 2) Would any other documents be required? 3) As a safeguard for myself, what should I ask the wife (sole beneficiary) to sign? You would need to execute an asset, in writing, to the wife and then have her execute a normal transfer to the tenants. It may be wise to ensure that the wife has independent legal advice before she makes a gift in this way to the tenants, so that she may be advised of the financial and tax consequences eg. the liability to inheritance tax, or absorption of part of her nil rate band allowance. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

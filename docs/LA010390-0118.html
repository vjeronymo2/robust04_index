			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COACHES' TASK: WINTERIZING FALL ATHLETES;  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOLS: SOME MAKE THE CHANGE FROM FOOTBALL, WRESTLING AND VOLLEYBALL TO  BASKETBALL EASILY. OTHERS FIND IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.  </P> <P> Tim Manning and Jim Farbaniec didn't have much time to celebrate after helping  Trabuco Hills High School win the Division VIII football championship in  December.  </P> <P> One day after the Mustangs beat Orange, 13-7, for their second consecutive  Division VIII title, Manning and Farbaniec were back in uniform.  </P> <P> Basketball uniforms, that is.  </P> <P> Manning, a quarterback and a defensive back, threw for a touchdown and  intercepted a pass in the Friday night football championship game.  </P> <P> Twenty-four hours later, he came off the bench and played 15 minutes, scoring  two points in a 67-64 victory over Mission Viejo in the third-place game of the  Trabuco Hills tournament.  </P> <P> It wasn't a great performance for Manning, who scored 15 and 17 points in games  the next two weeks, but it was a start.  </P> <P> "Jim and I went out there, looked at each other and laughed," said Manning, a  6-foot, 180-pound senior. "We couldn't believe we were doing this. We had just  won CIF and we were still thinking football."  </P> <P> Manning and Farbaniec are among several Orange County high school athletes who  make the transition between fall and winter sports.  </P> <P> Some, such as Manning, make the transition easily. Others have difficult, even  painful experiences.  </P> <P> Farbaniec didn't play against Mission Viejo and was used as a substitute the  next few weeks. He was still struggling to learn all of the Mustangs' plays.  </P> <P> "We had just won the football championship and I was ready to celebrate," said  Farbaniec, a 6-4, 260-pound offensive and defensive tackle. "But there I was  going out and running drills for basketball. It was kind of tough for the first  few days."  </P> <P> The transition can be particularly frustrating for basketball coaches.  </P> <P> They sometimes struggle early in the season because their best players are  playing football or volleyball. And, once the players do arrive, their shots  often draw iron but no net.  </P> <P> Rainer Wulf, Trabuco Hills basketball coach, said he encouraged Manning and  Farbaniec to play football. But their absence early in the basketball season  caused problems.  </P> <P> "The positive is that they're doing well in another sport, then come in here  after winning the CIF championship and they're really pumped up," Wulf said.  "It injects some energy back into the team.  </P> <P> "But we had to wait to put in some of our presses and things we do offensively  until Tim got here. They wouldn't work without him in there."  </P> <P> The late arrivals sometimes create frustrating practices.  </P> <P> Dan Henshall, girls' basketball coach at El Dorado, has four volleyball players  on his team. He spends the first few weeks of practice working with them on  rebounding.  </P> <P> "They're used to tipping the ball instead of shooting it," he said. "I keep  reminding them to catch the ball."  </P> <P> Charlie Brande, girls' volleyball coach at Corona del Mar, said most volleyball  players sit out the basketball season to compete for club volleyball teams.  </P> <P> "Because there are so many volleyball scholarships available, it's more  attractive for them to specialize (in volleyball)," he said. "That's wrong. We  try to work our club season around so they can play basketball too."  </P> <P> Although Manning's football and basketball seasons overlapped, he had few  problems adjusting. He is in his third year of varsity basketball and had  played during the summer, so he picked up the offensive plays right away.  </P> <P> "I still wasn't the player I was last summer," he said. "I was averaging 24 or  25 (points) last summer."  </P> <P> It was even tougher for Farbaniec, who sat out the basketball season as a  junior to concentrate on academics and train for the shot put and discus events  in the upcoming track season.  </P> <P> "Jim had taken a year off from basketball (so) he had to relearn everything,"  Wulf said. "It took a couple of weeks before I could call a play and he  wouldn't look at me like, 'Uh oh, what was this one?' "  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills had a two-week break in its schedule after playing in the San  Dieguito tournament in mid-December. Manning said the break has provided a  chance to get comfortable with the Mustangs' offense.  </P> <P> "We're getting everything burned back into our minds," Manning said.  </P> <P> Athletes make more than a physical transition, though.  </P> <P> Trevor Cooper of Huntington Beach said the transition from football to  wrestling was a demanding one physically and mentally.  </P> <P> Cooper, a nose guard who wrestles in the 191-pound class, separated his  shoulder during football practice last fall. He reinjured it in a wrestling  meet in mid-December and sat out three weeks.  </P> <P> "Making the transition was a big deal," Cooper said. "There was a lot of  pressure with football, and the break (in wrestling season) helps. The hunger  starts to come back, but it's still hard to be out."  </P> <P> Conditioning plays a big part in making the transition from sport to sport,  coaches say.  </P> <P> Henshall said his volleyball players came to basketball practice in good shape,  but still had room to improve.  </P> <P> "It's not too bad of a transition," he said. "I don't find too many problems.  It's harder to go from a sport like basketball to track and field.  </P> <P> "There you're going from an anaerobic sport to an aerobic sport, and from a  team sport to an individual sport."  </P> <P> Jim Reames, boys' basketball coach at Foothill, said football players make  "much more aggressive basketball players than regular basketball players."  </P> <P> "Physically, they're tougher," he said. "But conditioning-wise, they still need  to get their basketball legs back."  </P> <P> Wulf said most football players have trouble playing a full 32 minutes of  basketball when they initially make the switch.  </P> <P> "They're in long-term shape but not in basketball shape," Wulf said. "We ask  them to go hard 30 or 40 seconds and then get a few seconds break. In football,  it's just the opposite.  </P> <P> "You notice it especially if the player's a shooter. Tim's (Manning) shots all  hit the front of the rim that first week he was back. His legs weren't in the  type of shape to get high enough on his jump shot."  </P> <P> Manning said: "You have to get in shape or your legs die really quick.  Everything was moving in fast-forward ahead of me. I was confused trying to  remember plays. You may look ready but still thinking, 'Yeah I've a long way to  go.' "  </P> <P> In contrast, volleyball players make the switch to basketball with few  problems, rebounding notwithstanding, Henshall said.  </P> <P> Henshall said the similarities between volleyball and basketball make the  transition easier.  </P> <P> "We have a conditioning program for basketball, but I would prefer they go out  for volleyball," Henshall said. "They do a lot of jumping and lateral movement  in volleyball and that really helps them (for basketball). And they're working  on the timing of the ball coming to them.  </P> <P> "It helps on defense too. (In volleyball) they're always helping out on  defense, just like basketball. You get an assist in volleyball, just like  basketball."  </P> <P> The transition between sports can be a little confusing. At least Manning  believes so.  </P> <P> "By the San Dieguito tournament (mid-December), I felt more like a basketball  player instead of a football player trying to play basketball," he said.  </P></p>

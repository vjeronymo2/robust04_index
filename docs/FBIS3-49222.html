			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Madeleine Albright, U.S. permanent  representative to the United Nations, arrived today on a  three-day visit to Croatia. Mrs. Albright is the highest ranking  U.S. official to visit Croatia so far.    Madeleine Albright's visit to Zagreb is the beginning of her  European tour that will take her to 13 countries, mostly those  that embarked on the road to democracy as a result of the fall  of communism in the East. [passage omitted]    [Begin Albright recording] The conflict in this region has  no  justification. Aggression cannot be justified. War crimes  cannot be justified. Blocking humanitarian aid convoys cannot  be justified. It is time to stop the excuses and start making  good on many of the unfulfilled promises.    Second, the United States has supported and will continue to  support the territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia.  At the same time, the United States will continue to insist on  a peaceful, nonmilitary resolution of the problems of Croatia's  occupied territories and full respect for the rights and dignity  of all citizens of Croatia regardless of national identity. [end  recording]    [Announcer] In a brief meeting with the press, the U.S.  envoy  answered several questions. Among other things, she explained  what will be done regarding the incessant Serb attacks on  Sarajevo. The United States is aware of what is going on there  and is monitoring the situation with concern.    Should the Blue Helmets' role be altered from protecting the  peace to imposing peace? The reply was that UN soldiers should  continue performing their duties as they have been doing so far.  [passage omitted]    After the meeting with reporters, Madeleine Albright and the  John Shattuck, assistant human rights adviser to the secretary  of state, visited the U.S. military hospital at Pleso where 150  members of the U.S. Air Force are currently working. According  to her schedule, the U.S. envoy will visit Vukovar tomorrow.    [Begin Albright recording] It is very important for me as a  representative of the United States and as a member of the  Security Council to be able to see Vukovar and to be able to see  the mass graves there. I think this is something that we are  very concerned about and I hope very much that there will be  clear access for us. [end recording]    [Announcer] The U.S. envoy is scheduled to be received by  Croatian President Franjo Tudjman tomorrow.</p>

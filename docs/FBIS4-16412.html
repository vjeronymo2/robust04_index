			<p>BFN     [Text] Georgia's Foreign Minister Aleksandr Chikvaidze told  INTERFAX that efforts to settle the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict  showed certain progress now that an agreement had been signed on  the repatriation of refugees.    It was slow progress, said Chikvaidze, although nothing had  been lost and hope remained for ending the logjam in  Georgian-Abkhazian relations.    He said Georgia wanted more integration with the  Commonwealth  of Independent States and would be working to achieve this. It  needed more integration from primarily the economic point of  view. And Georgia would still try to keep its policies for  Russia and other Commonwealth republics in balance and working  for good relations between its own and other nations.    In Chikvaidze's view, economic cooperation between Georgia  and Russia would expand. Expanded cooperation and subsequent  economic growth could well lead to the exchange of Georgian  coupons for Russian rubles, said Chikvaidze and cited the  Belarussian experience in that field.</p>

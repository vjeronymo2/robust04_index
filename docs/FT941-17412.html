			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Money supply rise signals a strengthening recovery Evidence that the UK economic recovery is picking up pace came yesterday with a sharper-than-expected rise in the most narrow definition of the money supply. The Bank of England said M0 rose by a seasonally adjusted 5.8 per cent year-on-year to December, supporting recent anecdotal evidence of an excellent Christmas season for the retail sector. The M0 measure consists of notes and coins in circulation, plus banks' operational balances with the Bank of England. It is often a good indication of activity in the retail sector. The money supply figures did little to help sentiment in the UK government bond market, where long gilt prices fell by 1 1/4 points. Analysts felt the apparent buoyancy of the consumer sector may have dampened hopes of an early cut in UK interest rates. Gilts and equities were also affected by New Year profit-taking after strong December rallies. The FT-SE 100 index, down 38 points at one stage, rallied in the afternoon to close 9.9 points lower at 3,408.5. The 1 per cent month-on-month rise in M0 was well ahead of market expectations of a 0.4 per cent increase. However, the figure was partly foreshadowed last week by a sharp rise in bank notes in circulation, which rose an annual 7.1 per cent in the week to December 29. The 5.8 per cent year-on-year rise in M0 compares with a 5.1 per cent increase in the year to November. It is the highest since June 1990 and is well outside the government's monitoring range of 0-4 per cent. Yesterday's figures may have been distorted by temporary factors, such as a relatively high level of operational bank deposits and a surprisingly high rate of increase in Scottish and Northern Irish notes in circulation. Also, the sheer scale of consumer spending at Christmas, and the pattern of bank holidays, make the December M0 figures more volatile than other months. The unadjusted figures showed a less significant annual rise of 5.5 per cent, creating the possibility that there might be a problem with the seasonal adjustments. Mr Don Smith, UK economist at Greenwell Montagu, described the figures as 'erratic'. He said the market would monitor closely forthcoming figures on December retail sales and on January notes-in-circulation for more substantial evidence of the strength of consumer spending. M0 is only one of the inflationary indicators studied by the government. Others, such as M4, the broad money measure, are giving little sign of a rise in inflation, although Nationwide's house price index, published yesterday, showed a higher-than-expected 3.3 per cent annual increase. But there was speculation that the M0 rise might dissuade the government from making an early cut in base rates. Seasonally adjusted M0 has been rising at 7.9 per cent, on an annualised basis, over the last three months. 'This is the first piece of hard evidence that points to strong retail performance in December and that will push back the timing of a base rate cut to February or March,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at Warburg Securities. Sterling strengthened slightly against the D-Mark as traders felt an imminent base rate cut had become less likely. The pound closed 0.6 pfennigs higher at DM2.578 and gained a tenth of a cent to Dollars 1.4815. It also gained a little further in New York.

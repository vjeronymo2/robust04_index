			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Peasant farmers take over four Chiapas towns Mexican peasant farmers have taken over at least four towns in the southern state of Chiapas, protesting against official corruption and the poverty in which they live. The farmers, mainly from collective farms, are not connected with the Zapatista rebels that violently seized several towns in the state on New Year's Day. But they have clearly been inspired by the Zapatistas, and sense the government's sudden vulnerability to peasant protests. The peasants took over the towns of Huehuetan, Tuzantan, Teopisca, and Mapastepec in the past few days. In several other parts of the state unrest was building, with peasants occupying land and threatening to seize town halls. In the town of Teopisca, about 30km from the city of San Cristobal de las Casas, about 1,500 peasants from a collective farm peacefully took over the town hall on Monday, blocked incoming roads, and demanded the resignation of the mayor and free elections to elect a board of leaders. The farmers complained about lack of schools, drainage, and running water. They alleged the town mayor, Mr Hector Alvarez Gordillo, had taken money from the town budget, that he failed as promised to give out food and medicine, and repair a dirt road. Yesterday morning the peasants remained in control of the town hall, but opened the road, which is the main route to Guatemala. Farmers in Teopisca chanted 'The peasants have awoken - the Zapatistas have opened our eyes' as they walked around the town's central square. While they said they opposed the Zapatistas' call to arms, they approved of their goals, and used almost identical language to the guerrillas when complaining about Mexico's political system. Until this week Teopisca had been a model of tranquility. It had always supported the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, giving it 100 per cent of the vote in the mayoral elections two years ago. The last significant protest against the governing party was in 1985, and that was over the selection of the PRI candidate for mayor. 'We were fed up with the burden of injustice,' said Mr Braulio Gutierrez Lopez, one of the farmers' leaders. 'Things are now going to change because we have woken up to our suffering.' Mr Alvarez Gordillo, who took refuge in his large house in the main square, dismissed the farmers as supporters of the leftist Party of Democratic Revolution. But while some of the peasants, including Mr Gutierrez, are from the PRD, most said they had always voted for the PRI. As farmers explained their decision to take over the town hall, it seemed as if the Zapatista movement had removed the fear that prevented such protests before. Police beat up demonstrators in 1985, but this time the hands of the government are tied. Such a crackdown would seriously put back the prospects for a peaceful settlement in Chiapas.</p>

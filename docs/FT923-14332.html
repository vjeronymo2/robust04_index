			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Irish MPs told of coup at Telecom MR Brendan Hynes was sacked as chairman of Telecom Eireann, the state-run telecommunications company, at the weekend because he had lost the support and confidence of its board of directors, Ms Maire Geoghegan Quinn, the Irish minister for transport and telecommunications, said yesterday. She told parliament that she was left with a choice of either firing Mr Hynes or facing the resignation 'individually or collectively' of the board. 'The problem was not with the former chairman's thinking. The problem was with (his) modus operandi . . . the chairman must secure board approval for his/her proposals,' she said. The opposition Fine Gael party attacked the government for 'mismanaging' what is Ireland's most profitable public sector company and a party spokesman said: 'We are not really any wiser over the reasons for the differences between Mr Hynes and the board.' Telecom made a IPounds 94m profit on a IPounds 782m turnover last year. It has 1m customers, 13,500 employees and is estimated to be worth some IPounds 1bn were it to be privatised. Mr Hynes was appointed to the post just six months ago, replacing Mr Michael Smurfit who resigned last September over a controversial deal to build a new headquarters. Mr Hynes took a hands-on approach to the non-executive chairmanship, believing he had been given a mandate from the then telecommunications minister, Mr Seamus Brennan, to carry out a thorough review of the company ahead of its possible privatisation. Mr Brennan, however, lost his post to Ms Geoghegan Quinn, in the cabinet reshuffle following the resignation of Mr Charles Haughey as prime minister. Nonetheless, Mr Hynes, whose main business experience has been in the mining and exploration sector, pressed ahead with his review and in a statement at the weekend indicated that despite Telecom's good profit levels, problems of overmanning and heavy capital expenditure plans would have to be addressed to make the company competitive in the single European market. Telecom's directors yesterday went on the counter-attack saying that they 'unanimously' reject Mr Hynes' criticisms and that on June 26 they passed a motion of no confidence in him as chairman.

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / People: Hambro takes over from Hambro Rupert Hambro, 51, has taken over the chairmanship of JO Hambro &amp; Co following the death of his father, Jocelyn Hambro, who founded the merchant banking boutique. James Hambro, 45, succeeds his brother as managing director of the firm, which has around Pounds 500m of investment funds under management. JO Hambro was set up in 1986 by Jocelyn Hambro and his three sons - Rupert, Richard and James - when they split off from the much bigger Hambros group to branch out on their own. Jocelyn had chaired Hambros between 1970 and 1983 and Rupert had been chairman between 1983 and 1986. James Hambro's appointment is another sign that JO Hambro and its associate company, JO Hambro Magan, which specialises in providing corporate finance advice, are starting to go their separate ways. Hambro Magan was set up in February 1988 by George Magan, a corporate finance chief at Morgan Grenfell, Alton Irby, a former deputy chairman of Sedgwick, and Rupert and James Hambro. Rupert (left) was chairman of Hambro Magan until June 1993 and James Hambro has been a joint managing director. By taking on his new responsibilities at JO Hambro, James has followed his brother and stepped down from the Hambro Magan board. Although the two firms remain close, growing City concerns about potential conflicts of interest between the investment management and corporate finance sides of merchant banking type businesses are forcing them to adopt a more independent stance.</p>

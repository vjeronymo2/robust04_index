			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Burlington in Dollars 800m flotation BURLINGTON Industries, the North Carolina-based textiles group, is to return to the stock market almost five years after being taken private through a leveraged buy-out, via a Dollars 800m-plus flotation. The company plans a public offering of 57m shares, and said it expected these to be priced in the Dollars 14 to Dollars 16 range. The money raised from the issue would be used to pay down existing debt and recapitalise the company. Burlington Industries is the latest in a long line of highly-leveraged companies - including the likes of RJR Nabisco and Duracell - to take advantage of record stock market levels to pay down debt via equity issues. Interest charges on the heavy debts resulting from the Morgan Stanley-led buy-out have compounded operating losses at the textile company for much of the LBO period, although the operational side has improved recently. In the year to end-September, earnings before interest and tax were Dollars 156.8m, but were offset by a Dollars 251.7m interest charge.</p>

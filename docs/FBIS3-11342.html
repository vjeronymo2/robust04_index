The  suggestion to hold the meeting to see whether the constitutional  revision process takes off once and for all was made by the PMDB  leader in the lower house, Deputy Tarcicio Delgado (MG [Minas  Gerais]), who believes the work will not continue.    "Either the constitutional revision is made, or it is not.  We  must make a decision in order not to act like clowns. Right now,  attention is centered on the economic plan, the stripping of the  political rights of congressmen, and the election race," Delgado  said.    The proposal of PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]  leader Deputy Artur da Tavola (RJ [Rio de Janeiro]) to suspend  the constitutional revision work after voting on subjects of  consensus and to resume the work in 1995 is gaining force in  Congress. Tavola believes he has found a formula to make the  proposal legally feasible. He maintains that the power to amend  the Constitution could be delegated to another congress by  including an article in the chapter of temporary provisions of  the Constitution.    Deputy Miro Teixeira [PDT [Democratic Labor Party]-RJ)  agrees  with constitutional revision rapporteur Deputy Nelson Jobim  (PMDB-RS [Rio Grande do Sul]) that any proposal to suspend the  work is unconstitutional. He said the anticipated promulgation  of the Social Emergency Fund (FSE) has frozen the deadline of  the revision work in order to prevent questioning by the STF  [Federal Supreme Court].</p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> '89 CHARITABLE GIVING UP 10.5%  </P> <P> Americans gave nearly 10.5% more to charity last year, and about half the  $114.7 billion donated went to religious groups, according to a report.  </P> <P> The report attributed the increase to an 8.9% rise in personal income, a 21.1%  jump in the stock market, intensified fund-raising and growing awareness of  AIDS, homelessness, the environment and other concerns.  </P> <P> The report was issued by the AAFRC Trust for Philanthropy, an arm of the  American Assn. of Fund-Raising Counsel.  </P> <P> The biggest chunk of last year's donations, 47.4%, went to houses of worship,  religious organizations and the social services they provide.  </P> <P> Two natural disasters in 1989, the San Francisco earthquake and Hurricane Hugo,  generated an outpouring of financial aid. The Red Cross, for example, received  $155 million for both disasters in mostly small, individual donations.  </P></p>

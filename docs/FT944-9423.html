			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Nato may set up Bihac zone The US and its Nato allies are considering establishing a 10km heavy weapons exclusion zone around the Serb-besieged Bosnian town of Bihac, the US defence department said yesterday. This could allow allied air power to stop Serb forces overrunning the Moslem-held enclave. The possibility has been raised as forces loyal to Mr Fikret Abdic, ousted Moslem leader of the Bihac enclave, are being mobilised to join a Serb offensive against the area, UN officials said. Mr Michael Williams, UN spokesman, said in Sarajevo: 'Our estimate is that Mr Abdic is presently mobilising a force of at least 5,000 from refugee camps.' Bosnian Serb forces had fired seven Sam anti-aircraft missiles at the Bihac pocket on Monday, he confirmed. About 30,000 people loyal to Mr Abdic last August fled the Bihac pocket, a UN safe area, after being defeated by Bosnian government forces.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Bass agrees real ale marketing deals with Young's and Fuller's BASS, the UK's biggest brewer, has agreed reciprocal marketing deals with Young's and Fuller's, two of London's leading real ale brewers. Young's bitter will be sold in more than 100 of Bass' managed pubs in London, while the Wandsworth brewery's 180 pubs will stock Tennent's Extra, Bass' premium draught lager. Fuller's London Pride will also be offered in Bass pubs and about 150 of Fuller's 200 pubs in the south-east will sell Carling Black Label, the Bass brand which is the UK's best-selling lager. Bass said the real ales could eventually be offered to all its 500 pubs in the south-east. Most of those selected would carry both Young's bitter and London Pride, a stronger beer, but this would be decided on a pub-by-pub basis. The deal marks another stage in the resurgence of real, or cask-conditioned, ales which have been regaining popularity after years of yielding ground, first to keg bitter and more recently to nationally-promoted lager brands, such as Carling. Although the recession has cut overall demand for beer, UK markets for premium lager and real ale are both growing. Grolsch, the Dutch brewer, is currently in talks to buy Ruddles, the Leicestershire-based brewer founded in 1858, in a deal which could be worth Pounds 40m, according to industry estimates. Bass said that Carling was continuing to gain market share and currently claims about 20 per cent of the market for non-premium lager. Bass already brews its own real ales, but said: 'These quite different beers will extend the choice to the customer. They have such a strong consumer franchise in the south-east that what we offer will not suffer.' There are, however, continuing pressures towards consolidation in the brewing industry. Fuller's said that growing demand for London Pride had obliged it to increase capacity at its Chiswick brewery, and it had accordingly decided to end production of K2, its own lager brand. 'K2 was a good brand, but we never set out to be a national brand. We could never offer the discounts of the big operators,' Fuller's said. See Lex</p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Seville and World Expo '92 (1): The fair of the century - About 18m visitors are expected at Seville's Universal Exposition. The fair, commemorating the 500th anniversary of Columbus's voyage to America, also heralds the return of Spain to Europe's mainstream after centuries of seclusion THE WORLD'S most sophisticated railway lines run up to it. Europe's newest airport was built for it. Spain's best roads have just reached it. What if no one comes to it? Of course they will] Welcome to the 1992 Universal Exposition, or Expo '92, in Seville, the biggest, certainly the most expensive, and easily the most rapidly assembled celebration of any single event, probably, in human history. The cost? About Dollars 9bn, but who's counting? It is too easy to knock Expo - it is a big, brash, fabulous waste of money  - and much harder to appreciate what its success means to Spain. This is a country gripped by one dominating and rampaging anxiety - what do other people think of it? Hardly a week goes by in Spain without a symposium somewhere devoted to this very serious matter. Its newspapers write articles about what foreign newspapers write about Spain. Now, in these few days before Expo opens and the country's 1992 celebrations (including the Olympics in Barcelona in July) really get underway, Spain is fluffing its skirts and patting its hair like a young lady preparing for her first date, hoping to get a glimpse of herself in a nice big mirror before the night is over. Expo and the foreigners that go to it are that mirror. By Expo's success and by the smiles on the faces of its visitors, Spain, or a large part of it, will judge itself. Spaniards know that many northern Europeans think they are a lazy, good for nothing and untrustworthy lot. It is nonsense, of course, but there have been some horrible moments along the way to Expo: when a terrible fire, caused by careless working practices, destroyed one of the Expo's most important pavilions in February, the press was vicious. 'Chapuza Nacional' screamed one - national cock-up  - as if to say it before some foreigner did. Earlier a replica of the first ship to sail round the world toppled over moments after being launched and some crew in replicas of Columbus's three ships tried to run away when they reached the US. About 18m people, the organisers say, will go to Seville to meander about the town and the Expo site between its opening on April 20 and its closure 176 days later on October 12, 500 years to the day that Christopher Columbus first set foot in the new World. The site is Cartuja Island, once home to a monastery where Columbus often rested after his great voyages. The 450 hectare island sits in the middle of the Guadalquivir River that skirts Seville and up which eventually sailed gold-laden galleons for the century or so in which Spain was able to reap maximum benefit from the colonisation of Latin America that Columbus had begun. The monastery still stands, but dwarfed by the incredible Expo city that has been built around it. It is impossible to stand in the middle of it - even while frantic last-minute preparations continued  - and not be thrilled by the sheer scale of what has been put down on Cartuja and the speed with which it has been done. Just 18 months ago Cartuja was little more than a swampy bulldozed mess. In four days time the Expo will open its 95 pavilions, 70 bars, 150 shops, 40,000-place car park, 16 banks to the public. Somehow, the organisers have managed to squeeze in 55,000 different pieces of entertainment at 21 stages dotted around the site. The New York Metropolitan Opera will be coming, and so will opera from Vienna, Dresden and Milan. Trinidad and Tobago are sending a steel band. The whole point is that everyone is coming and Expo '92 is probably going to be the last truly great cultural statement of this century. It is not, or it should not be, a trade fair. It is a celebration of knowledge and, specifically, discovery. The country, theme and corporate pavilions may not push the barriers of architectural knowledge beyond what we already know, but nowhere on earth are the eccentric and conventional forms and structures of the late 20th century so brilliantly scrambled together. At the risk of sounding like a publicist, Expo promises to be terrific fun. This is, after all, Andalucia. The incredible noise on the streets and in the bars of Seville could just as easily be the sound of Spain's beating heart. These people taught the rest of Spain the meaning of fiesta. Visitors might find Seville a little cramped - not any more so than during its Easter fiesta - but it is the smallest city ever to host a Universal Exposition and it has managed to attract the greatest number of countries to take part. One result will be a great shortage of accommodation and what is available will be very expensive. For most of the time the fair is opened, it will also be unspeakably hot. That partly explains why the Expo site will be open until four in the morning every day and also why the organisers felt it necessary to plant 350,000 trees and shrubs around the site. Shade will be Expo's most valuable commodity. Just how valuable the Expo is to Seville is already easy to measure. It was King Juan Carlos who first suggested (naturally, when one is the King, one's ideas are always one's very own ideas) holding an Expo at Seville in 1992. That was in the late 1970s. But it was the election of the socialist government, led by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, in 1982 that really set things moving. Mr Gonzalez and his most senior advisers were all Andalucians in the early years and they have bent over backwards to make sure that, along with the Expo, Andalucia in 1992 would be used to mark the return of Spain to prominence as a major economic and democratic power. Their Andalucia was (and still is) a largely poor, dry and illiterate place. It has bred some wonderful people but given them precious little to live off. So Andalucia has been showered with gifts for this year. Easily the most exotic is the world's newest high-speed train line, between Madrid and Seville, with a branch to the Expo entrance. Just outside Seville, where the airport was once little more than a blockhouse, stands a spanking new terminal capable of taking 8m passengers a year. After the Expo, it could take Seville 20 years to use that airport to capacity. Around the city are nearly 70km of new roads and eight new bridges cross the Guadalquivir, while five new highways connect Seville with Andalucia's other great centres and with Madrid. This is Andalucia's big chance. It has become fashionable to speak of Andalucia as Europe's next, or first, Silicon Valley. But it may just find the imagination needed to turn the infrastructure it has been showered with in the past few years to its advantage once all the visitors have gone. The Expo organisers have already established a project - Cartuja 93  - which is designed to preserve the Expo site more or less intact for use as a base for research and study. Andalucia has never shown much interest in the future, but Cartuja may change that. Just as it may change the way Spaniards think about their past. What is being celebrated here is Columbus's discovery of America, or what he thought was the East, and the firm establishment, for arguably the first time, of true democracy in Spain. Both are important, for the Expo has neatly coincided with an intense effort by Spain to reconnect itself with its former colonies in Latin America, which now account for just 3 per cent of Spain's trade. Latin America holds up a rather different mirror to Spain than do its admiring European partners. It is an older mirror, perhaps darker too. The devastation wrought by the Conquistadores on the native populations of the countries they invaded still provokes quick and fiery argument in Spain. Should Spain feel shame at that memory? Surely not now, just as it has been able to welcome back and legalise the Jews 500 years after their expulsion by Ferdinand and Isabella. This is not a very contemplative society, but Spaniards who think about themselves might want to extract as much as they can from the Latin Americans who come to Seville. That continent's chaos, its struggle for democracy, has a frighteningly clear reflection in Spain as well. Some people think they know why - that by the time the Conquistadores sallied forth democracy in Spain had already been lost as a trade off for land and title. That notion is suspect simply for being so neat and tidy and the lessons to be drawn from what Columbus began 500 years ago in Latin America are not easily defined. The Spanish started planning for 1992 calling it the year of Discovery until South Americans reminded Spaniards that people were living in the new world long before 1492. Spain changed the theme of 1992, then, to the Re-encounter. That seems more apt and, even if it says nothing much, it is at least a mark of a new humility.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Shao Ling (6730 7227)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 2 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--In view of  the fact that the legitimate rights and interests of workers and  staff of foreign-funded enterprises are ignored and infringed  upon, the mainland's All-China Federation of Trade Unions has  repeatedly called on foreign-funded enterprises to make proper  arrangement for working hours and respect worker and staff  personal freedoms. Not long ago, labor disputes repeatedly  broke out in foreign-funded enterprises, and some workers and  staff even went on strike. Hence, the National People's  Congress (NPC) started deliberating the "Labor Law" from April  and is prepared to push the establishment of trade unions in  foreign-funded enterprises within this year with a view to  developing them into buffer organizations safeguarding worker  and staff rights and interests and settling labor disputes.    It was reported that from 1979 onwards, there are a total of  more than 170,000 foreign-funded enterprises (including joint  ventures, Sino-foreign cooperative enterprises, and enterprises  solely invested by foreign businesses) with a real investment of  $60 billion by Hong Kong, Taiwanese, and overseas businesses.  It should be said that these foreign-funded enterprises have  played a very great role in the mainland's economic construction  and employment and brought about economic prosperity in various  localities.    However, foreign-funded enterprises have also caused many  problems. In recent years, cases of employer infringement of  workers' rights and interests and personal freedom frequently  occurred. For example, in a Taiwanese-funded shoe-making  factory in Fujian Province, Taiwanese businessmen surnamed Chang  and Chen tied up and violently beat a female worker surnamed Yu  who had stolen two pairs of shoes. Later, they even put the  shoes up around her neck before the public and then locked her  in a big iron cage, thus arousing public indignation. In  another example, a piece of jewelry was lost in a joint-venture  jewelry factory in Zhangjiang Township in Shanghai's Pudong New  Area, the boss went so far as to order all female workers to  take off their clothes so body searches could be made. In  another case, a foreign-funded factory in Tianjin went so far as  to issue "toilet-going cards" to workers and staff and  stipulated that every worker could only go to the toilet for  five minutes and anyone violating this rule would be fined. All  these cases were violations of worker and staff personal dignity  which contravened mainland labor decrees.    Meanwhile, foreign employers of foreign-funded enterprises  arbitrarily ordered workers and staff to work overtime with  little or no overtime payment. In some cases, workers who had  worked overtime till the early morning on the next day had to go  to work as usual on that day. It is a widespread phenomenon in  various localities that workers frequently work 12 to 16 hours  in a row. According to the regulations, if workers go to work on  statutory paid holidays, such as the New Year's Day and National  Day, factory employers should pay them 50 percent or even 100  percent more than their daily wages. However, workers and staff  in foreign-funded enterprises do not enjoy this benefit. In  this way, labor disputes frequently break out.    In addition, in order to seek superprofits, some Hong Kong  and Taiwanese businesses often find ways to cut down worker and  staff pay when enterprise interests come into conflict with that  of workers and staff, such as using factory discipline and rules  to hold down or deduct worker and staff pay. For example,  although an eight-hour work system has been set as a mainland  rule and Sundays are fixed as rest days, many foreign-funded  enterprises stipulate in private that workers and staff must  work overtime unconditionally, otherwise they will be punished  and their pay will be deducted for staying away from work  without good reason. In the "staff rules" set by a  foreign-funded enterprise in Guangdong, as many as 46 of them  are related to pay deductions and fines, and 80 percent of the  workers and staff are punished every month!    Even more serious is that many small and medium-sized  foreign-funded factories generally neglect labor safety and lack  protective equipment and fire prevention facilities.  Consequently, accidents occur again and again. Last year, when  two factories run by Hong Kong and Taiwanese businesses in  Shenzhen and Fuzhou caught fire, workers could not escape  because there were inadequate fire safety facilities and the  front and back doors were locked, thus causing serious  casualties.    After receiving many complaints from workers and staff of  foreign-funded enterprises, last December the All-China  Federation of Trade Unions openly called on departments  concerned to take measures to protect the personal safety and  legitimate rights and interests of workers and staff of  foreign-funded enterprises. By the end of last April, the  mainland Ministry of Labor, Ministry of Public Security, and the  All-China Federation of Trade Unions jointly issued a circular  strictly prohibiting foreign-funded and private enterprises from  restricting worker and staff personal freedom by locking and  shutting workshops and worker and staff living quarters.  Enterprises committing criminal offenses will be investigated  by judicial organs to see whether they have criminal  responsibility.    Before and after the NPC deliberated the "Labor Law" last  April, Guangdong and some other provinces and municipalities  responded to the call and made preparations for helping  foreign-funded enterprises set up trade unions. The trade  unions can be considered as organizations negotiating with  employers on improving labor conditions, safety facilities, and  pay and welfare, and as the buffer zone of labor disputes to  prevent workers and staff from going on strike because of undue  demands and to protect employers' and employees' justifed rights  and interests.</p>

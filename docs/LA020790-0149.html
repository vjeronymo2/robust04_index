			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> ALLEGED THREATS LEAD TO ARREST  </P> <P> A Newbury Park man unhappy about the investigation and prosecution of his son's  death was in jail today after allegedly making death threats against a Ventura  County prosecutor and an assistant sheriff, authorities said.  </P> <P> Charles Flores, 47, was being held in lieu of $500,000 bail on suspicion of  threatening an executive officer, Sheriff's Lt. Kelli McIlvain said.  </P> <P> McIlvain said Flores was arrested Tuesday night after calling the district  attorney's office and threatening to kill Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Holmes and  Assistant Sheriff Oscar Fuller. Authorities declined to give details of the  threats.  </P> <P> The threats were apparently motivated by Flores' unhappiness over how  authorities handled the death of his son, John Flores, 18, during a Jan. 20,  1989, fight at a party in Newbury Park, McIlvain said. The death was  investigated by the Sheriff's Department, and two men were arrested. One was  later convicted of assault, and the other was acquitted after being tried on a  charge of manslaughter.  </P></p>

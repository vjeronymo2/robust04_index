			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 16 April Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] At a cabinet meeting on 15 April, the government  decided on an amendment to the Construction Business Law, and  will submit it to the Diet for deliberation during its current  session. The amendment aims at preventing a recurrence of  financial scandals involving general contractors by extending  the disqualification period from two to five years, during which  licenses are not issued to construction firms whose licenses  have been revoked for involvement in bid-riggings, and by  strengthening punitive provisions in the law.    In response to a series of financial scandals involving  general contractors who have been accused of rigging bids for  public works projects, last December the Central Council on  Construction Contracting Business (an advisory body for the  construction minister) compiled an agenda of proposals calling  for adoption of an open competitive tender system. The agenda  also calls for the "exclusion of disqualified construction  companies from participating in biddings under the new tender  system" and the "strengthening of penalties." The government  has decided to amend the Construction Business Law in line with  the proposals.    The Construction Business Law stipulates that if  representatives or local managers of construction companies are  sentenced to more than one year in prison, the license of that  construction company shall be revoked. If revised in accordance  with the amendment, the Construction Business Law will stipulate  that if representatives or local managers of construction  companies are sentenced to imprisonment for any length of time,  their licenses shall be revoked. Under the Construction  Business Law to be revised in accordance with the amendment, the  representatives or local managers of construction firms, if  found to have falsely stated in their applications for licenses,  will face less than six months of imprisonment and they will pay  1-3 million yen in fines if they are found to have continued to  do their businesses in violation of administrative measures that  suspend their businesses.    The amendment makes it mandatory for construction firms to  keep construction records of their subcontractors. The  amendment also calls on construction firms to strengthen their  guidance systems and to position supervisory engineers on  construction sites in order for public works projects to be  implemented properly and fairly.    In a bid to develop blue-chip construction companies, the  amendment calls for extending the effective period of licenses  from three to five years.</p>

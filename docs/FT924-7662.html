			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Travel: Merzbacher - the world's weirdest lake / In Kirghizstan, Giles Whittel buys a motor cycle and goes in search of a lake famous for its disappearing act 'Welcome to our sunny republic', chirps the poster on dehydration in the tourist hotel in Urgench, the town with the ugliest name in Uzbekistan. But Uzbekistan is more than sunny. IN JUNE, at any rate, it is terrifyingly hot. The heat mugs you the moment you step out of the shade. To cool down, you have to heat up first by drinking tea, then sweat. There is often a wind but never a wind chill factor. It is like being in a fan-assisted oven. Forgive me, then, for racing through the immortal cities of Bokhara and Samarkand on a night bus bound for Bishkek, the renamed capital of neighbouring, and very much cooler, Kirghizstan. I was meant to be slogging through the desert in the footsteps of an eccentric correspondent of The Times who walked this way in 1914. But he was tougher or madder than me. For the time being I had given up. Russian colonists used to escape the central Asian summer in the mountains behind Bishkek rather as the British did in Simla. But since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kirghizstan's Russians have been returning to the Motherland in their thousands. Nikolai Shchetnikov, a geologist-turned-travel-agent with a quiet and efficient manner belied only by his screw-topped metal briefcase full of vodka, is one of the minority staying on. We were watching his video, Holiday in Kirghizstan, in his flat in Bishkek. An orange helicopter banked steeply over a glacier against a backdrop of bleakly beautiful mountains. It flew down the glacier past a series of dark triangular buttresses, each about 3,000ft high. Suddenly, we saw a lake, filling the mouth of a neighbouring valley, pushing against the flank of the glacier, studded with icebergs. 'Merzbacher', said Nikolai, and pressed 'pause.' Merzbacher was a German geographer who penetrated the Central Tien Shan several times early this century and discovered what may be the world's weirdest lake: 15,000ft up and extremely remote, the lower Merzbacher lake is held in most of the time by the second biggest glacier in the CIS. But every summer its ice-plug melts and in three days of furious gurgling it disappears. It is hard to get to, but not impossible. Nikolai will take you there on a 16-day trip including high-altitude sightseeing by helicopter and some trekking for about Pounds 450 excluding travel to and from Bishkek. I preferred to travel independently as far as possible, so we arranged to meet at a distant helipad. To get there, I bought a motorcycle. Throughout the former Soviet Union the military police and many others ride motorcycles called Urals. Based on a 1946 BMW 650cc machine with spoked wheels and a sidecar, they have tremendous character but as much oomph as an ill camel. Mine was nearly new and cost Pounds 200. I called it Ural. Ural and I were pulled over five minutes into our maiden ride. The policeman, checking the first English driving licence of his career, decently ignored the paragraph which says its holder may not ride a motorcycle. But his finger stopped at the word 'Provisional.' 'Professional, da?' 'Da.' It was the first of countless checks, but the closest any Kirghiz traffic cop came to speaking English. More often, convinced of alcohol's warming properties, they would simply offer vodka or 96 per cent pure spirit. The road passed another lake, far more famous than Merzbacher. This was Issyk-Kul, 100 miles long, ringed by snow-capped mountains and fed by 70 rivers (though none, mysteriously, flows out). It is the Lake Geneva in president Akayev's vision of Kirghizstan as the Switzerland of central Asia. But it is somehow disappointing. Laurens van der Post wrote in 1966 of people still living nomadically and hunting with eagles on the shores. They don't now. Wide-boys and hypochondriacs come from all over the CIS to its half-built concrete sanatoria. And mafiosi whose poppy-growing is no longer supported by the regime smoke, disconsolately, tobacco. Beyond Issyk-Kul, the road turned south up a wide alpine valley and the weather changed to snow. Herdsmen retreated into round felt tents while their horses and the great red screes higher up turned white. At the pass, the arctic-looking Ehan Tengri range came briefly into view, still 100 miles to the east. Lake Merzbacher was up there somewhere in the ice. Then the road dived into a long, twisting canyon which ended at an almost deserted tin-mining town. Nikolai was waiting there with some Spanish climbers - his only dollar-paying clients of the year - and a cauldron of ibex stew. Where central Asia resisted Sovietisation, Islam, not mountains, did the resisting. In fact, the Russian enforcers of Soviet imperial rule seem to have relished defying geography in the highest, coldest outposts of their empire. Enter the Mi-8, a five-rotored beast of a helicopter. Its orange Aeroflot paint-job is always streaked with soot from its two deafening turbines. It was the standard Soviet mountain helicopter for doctors, vets, engineers and climbers. Now it serves western heliskiers too, at Dollars 400 (Pounds 245.30) an hour. It is king of the wilderness, operating from lonely roadheads up to a staggering ceiling of over 18,000ft. We flew 50 miles up the Inylchek glacier with the windows open, landing on fresh snow amid yawning crevasses an hour's walk from Nikolai's base camp. The camp faced the awesome north wall of Pik Pobeda, the highest mountain in the Tien Shan. Behind the tents, a spur of rock rose steeply towards Pik Maxim Gorky, where some of Nikolai's proteges were in training for a climbing competition. Lacking money, Russian climbers pay heavily for their thrills in both lives and frostbite. Four Siberians from Tomsk were recovering in the camp after a stormy ascent of Khan Tengri, a legendary marble mountain further up our side of the glacier which is said to glow pink on fine evenings. It seemed to take them three days to warm up, sitting like zombies in the dining tent in all the clothes they owned, picking occasionally at the scabs on their swollen faces. During this time I had a go at Ehan Tengri myself, and was a mere vertical mile from the summit when my heart ('motor' in Russian) had had enough. Then Nikolai informed me that the three Siberians who could still walk (one had had part of a big toe removed with a pair of scissors but no anaesthetic) were to form my escort to Lake Merzbacher. None of them had been there before, but Nikolai said the route was easy: descend the main glacier, passing its first three tributaries - glaciers Dikki, Komsomol and Proletarian Tourist - and camp under Pik Frunze Technical College. It would take six hours. We left at 8am and were still going 14 breakneck hours later. By the end I was gasping like a bad actor and my 'motor' was hurting again. I cursed the Siberians for being so fit after seeming so nearly dead. There were three more hours to do next morning to the lake. Within sight of its icebergs we were stopped by an especially sinister and serpentine crevasse. 'How much longer?' I asked, unfairly. 'Forty minutes.' The Siberians conferred on how to jump the crevasse. 'No. Maybe two hours.' We backtracked but still found no way through. 'Is it impossible?' I asked. 'It is possible, but this year . . . maybe two days from here.' Two days to do a quarter of a mile? We ate some bread and cheese and turned back. Two days later the lake began to drain. I knew because by that time I was down near the snout of the glacier trying to take a mineral bath in a hot spring, but the spring was under 9ft of cold grey water surging angrily towards China. Here were tens of millions of tons of ex-lake thundering down an ex-Soviet canyon only to evaporate in a vast and uninhabitable desert, the dreaded Takla-Makan depression - Mars-on-Earth. It wasn't the lower Merzbacher itself but it was extraordinary enough, and cooler than Uzbekistan.

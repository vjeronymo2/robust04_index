			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / UK Company News: The Telegraph turns in Pounds 16m but circulation slips below 1m Sales of the Daily Telegraph last month sunk below the symbolic 1m mark for the first time in many years. The official circulation figures for April for the daily, whose readers have a higher age profile than those of most other national titles, missed the mark by a whisker. The average for the month was 998,921 copies, although this represented a decline of only 0.17 per cent in a market down by 0.43 per cent. 'The FT did 10 times worse than us with a 1.69 per cent drop to 298,971,' said Mr Joe Cooke, managing director of the Telegraph Group. For good measure he added that The Guardian had dropped below 400,000 to 397,177, although the 30p Times put on 1.63 per cent to 478,419. The mixed circulation news came as the Telegraph announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 16m for the first quarter of 1994, against Pounds 19.1m for the comparable period - although that figure was boosted by a Pounds 6.5m profit on the sale of the group's investment in Trinity International. Advertising revenue was up by about 18 per cent, and the company said that the initial recovery from recession was continuing. Advertising revenues were approaching levels last seen in 1989. 'The business is as sound as a bell,' said Mr Cooke, who added that circulation of the Daily Telegraph would soon be back up above 1m again. Turnover increased by 10 per cent to Pounds 68.8m, and operating profit at Pounds 12.1m was up by more than 16 per cent. Earnings per share, excluding profit on sale of investments, rose from 5.9p to 8.4p. For the six months to March average sales of the Daily Telegraph fell 1.65 per cent to 1,016,468, although sales of the Sunday Telegraph increased by more than 6 per cent to 617,505 in the same period. Further evidence of a recovery in the newspaper advertising market came yesterday from Pearson, the media and entertainment group which owns the Financial Times. At its annual meeting the group reported a 'significant recovery' in advertising revenues. Lord Blakenham, chairman, said the first four months was never much of a guide to the full year 'but advertising revenue was higher in the first four months, led by the Financial Times'. See Lex</p>

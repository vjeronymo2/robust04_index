The troops conducted exercises on 28  March for about two hours near the regimental base.    In this regard, Colonel Carlos Medina Monjagata, the Armed  Forces social communications director, reported that the tanks  from the "Colonel Felipe Toledo" No. 2 Armored Cavalry Regiment  were mobilized within the framework of a training exercise  program for new recruits.    He explained that citizens were not informed about the  mobilization because it was scheduled to be held in the vicinity  of the regiment. He added: "The people are not informed when a  two-hour exercise is held. They are informed only when tanks  will cross the Paraguay River so that no one is alarmed."    Medina Monjagata stated that normally the recruits  participate in two training exercises, the first during the  basic training period and the second during the advanced program.</p>

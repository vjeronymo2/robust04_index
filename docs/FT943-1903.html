			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Rival declares himself premier A long-standing tribal rival to Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi yesterday declared himself Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini's traditional premier, a position formerly claimed by the Chief, Mark Suzman writes. Prince Mcawayezeni Zulu, a member of the royal family and former regent of the Zulu kingdom, said he was assuming the duties of the honorary post with immediate effect. This will deepen the rift between the two most important Zulu politicians in the country. On Tuesday King Goodwill broke relations with the Chief raising fears of inter-Zulu clashes. The South African army, at the request of the ANC-led central government, yesterday dispatched troops to guard the king.</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / De Klerk offers blacks cabinet seats: Pretoria goes some way to meeting ANC's demands, but ministers to stay PRESIDENT FW de Klerk offered yesterday to include South Africa's black opposition groups in his cabinet and promised to amend tough security laws in an effort to avoid threatened confrontation with the African National Congress. The moves, in a speech by Mr de Klerk to parliament in Cape Town, was the government's reply to an ultimatum from the ANC which expires next Thursday. The ANC has said it will boycott talks on a post-apartheid constitution unless the government acts by then to halt township violence in which nearly 10,000 people have died since 1984. Mr de Klerk offered concessions on the most important of the demands, although he ignored others and may not have gone far enough to prevent the ANC suspending talks. He will not accede, for example, to the ANC's call for the dismissal of Mr Adriaan Volk, law and order minister, and of General Magnus Malan, defence minister. He is attempting to go some way towards meeting most of the other six points in the ultimatum: dismantling of all counter-insurgency units; suspension of policemen involved in two incidents where ANC supporters were killed; a ban on the carrying of weapons at public gatherings; a ban on the issue of live ammunition to police at such events; phasing out of single-sex township hostels; and an independent inquiry into complaints of security force misconduct. Mr de Klerk said he would go ahead with all-party talks on May 24 and 25 about ways to end the violence 'with or without the ANC.' Responding to one of the ultimatum's seven demands, Mr de Klerk said he would scrap some of the most hated provisions of the country's Internal Security Act, the law used to crush anti-apartheid protest in the 1980s. The aim, he said, was to strip the law of 'provisions that may have an inhibiting effect on participation in normal political activities'. The act's sweeping authority to banish dissidents, close newspapers and put anti-apartheid activists under house arrest would be removed. Mr de Klerk stopped short of announcing the abolition of detention without trial, saying that the provisions for declaring organisations illegal and detaining people for questioning - section 29 of the act - would be 'amended drastically'. In a move which may go some way towards meeting the ANC's demand for an interim government, Mr de Klerk suggested that a transitional cabinet could include 'a relatively broad spectrum of competent South Africans', including members of the main parties to constitutional negotiations. Such a cabinet, which would by implication include the ANC, could only be formed after a planned multi-party conference had been convened to discuss drawing up a new constitution. Dealing with other aspects of the ANC ultimatum, he announced a 10-point plan to combat the violence which has claimed more than 100 lives in the past week. He said that the police force would be strengthened, community involvement would be sought to end violence and a permanent commission would investigate causes of unrest. There would also be job creation programmes to aid social conditions in townships, and money for victims of violence. The men-only hostels, where much of the violence has been centred, would be converted or upgraded and control of dangerous weapons would be 'intensified'.</p>

			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / An early start to next summer: The growing battle for record sales of holidays Food poisoning in Minorca. Mould in the showers in Majorca. The tabloid press this week had no difficulty filling its front pages with holiday horrors, in spite of the lull in air traffic controllers' strikes. But whatever the inconvenience, travel agents are expected this year to have sold a record 9m summer holidays. This week they broke another record by announcing discounts for next summer - the earliest price war anyone in the industry can remember. Lunn Poly, the largest travel retail chain, started last Tuesday with discounts of 11 per cent on summer 1995 holidays. By yesterday it was offering 15 per cent discounts. Going Places and Thomas Cook, the second and third largest chains, also increased their top discounts to 15 per cent. In spite of Lunn Poly's boast that it was 'giving away' over Pounds 25m in discounts, the price cuts are not the undiluted boon to consumers that they seem. Buyers still have to purchase the travel agent's own holiday insurance. Nevertheless, they do represent a considerable financial sacrifice by the travel agents, which is why they will probably not continue for long. Travel agents earn commissions of between 10 per cent and 15 per cent on each holiday. Offering a 15 per cent discount means losing the commission, with the sale of travel insurance the only means of making any money. Many argue there is little point in doing so this early. The traditional time for launching a price war is late August or early September. Few people are likely to book before they have taken this summer's holiday and more than 3m of those people expected to take a summer holiday this year have not yet left. The reason for the early reductions lies not with the travel agents but with the groups which own them. Lunn Poly is owned by Thomson, the largest tour operator. Going Places is owned by Airtours, the second largest operator. Tour operator profit margins are small. The top 30 tour operators' aggregate pre-tax profits last year represented just 2.6 per cent of their turnover, according to Civil Aviation Authority figures. This was lower than 1992 when the margin was 2.8 per cent and 1991 when it was 3.8 per cent. But it was a considerable improvement on 1989 when the profit margin was nought and 1987 when it was a 0.9 per cent loss. Holiday prices this year have fallen again. The average price of a summer holiday booked through Lunn Poly by the end of June was Pounds 353, compared with Pounds 356 last year. With profit margins so small, generating sales is crucial. There is evidence that being first in the market can give tour operators a flying start, increasing their market share. On the evidence of last year, however, that increase is not easy to maintain. Last year Thomson sent its summer 1994 brochures to travel agents in the middle of August - before Airtours and Owners Abroad. By Christmas last year Thomson's market share was 41 per cent, compared with 29.1 per cent at the same time in 1992. Airtours' market share was down to 18.3 per cent at Christmas from 20.6 per cent the year before. Owners Abroad fell to 9.5 per cent from 15.8 per cent in 1992. But by April and May this year Thomson fell to 27 per cent, Airtours fell to 16.3 per cent and Owners Abroad had risen to 11.6 per cent. This week Thomson was out first again, but with a single family holiday brochure rather than its full summer 1995 programme. Airtours responded with its full programme. Lunn Poly is offering discounts on all operators' holidays. Going Places and Thomas Cook are, however, offering smaller discounts on Thomson holidays than on packages from Airtours and Owners Abroad. Thomas Cook says this is because Thomson will not pay a commission of more than 10 per cent. Going Places says it offers top discounts only to those operators prepared to help bear the cost. Few will relish doing so for long. Travellers who want to be sure of discounts should book soon.</p>

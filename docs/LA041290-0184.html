			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: POMONA;  </P> <P> PLAN TO EASE BILLBOARD RULES  </P> <P> The City Council has instructed the Planning Commission to consider an  ordinance that would expand the areas where billboards are permitted.  </P> <P> Billboards now are authorized only in manufacturing zones, but a number of  billboards are located outside the zones.  </P> <P> The proposed ordinance would allow billboard companies to retain their existing  signs or relocate them in commercial and manufacturing zones. In addition, new  signs would be permitted along freeways in manufacturing and  administrative-professional zones.  </P> <P> Mayor Donna Smith has sharply attacked the proposed ordinance submitted by  Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant, because it was largely written by a billboard  company, the Patrick Media Group.  </P> <P> She said the city should not allow an industry to write its own regulations. In  addition, she said, the ordinance would increase the number of billboards,  contrary to the wishes of residents who persuaded the council to enact tough  billboard restrictions in 1964 and successfully maintained those restrictions  through a referendum eight years later.  </P> <P> After action by the Planning Commission, the ordinance will be considered again  by the council.  </P></p>

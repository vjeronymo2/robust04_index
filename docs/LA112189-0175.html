			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'CHARIOTS OF FIRE' RUNNER'S MEDALS, MEMORABILIA SOLD  </P> <P> Medals and memorabilia belonging to Olympic hero Harold Abrahams, whose story  was told in the movie "Chariots of Fire," fetched $39,720 at auction today.  </P> <P> Egyptian-born entrepreneur Mohamed Fayed bought about 30 of Abrahams' medals,  stopwatches he used during training and his Commander of the British Empire  award bestowed by Queen Elizabeth II in 1957, Christie's auctioneers said.  </P> <P> The gold medal Abrahams won for the 100-meter race in the 1924 Paris Olympics  was not among the items sold; it was stolen from his home about 50 years after  his victory.  </P> <P> Abrahams' struggles to win Olympic gold were portrayed by Ben Cross in the 1981  Oscar-winning movie. He was the first and only Englishman to win the Olympic  100 meters and gave up athletics after a fall in a long jump competition in  1925. He died in 1978.  </P> <P> "I was inspired by a man who put principle before winning," said Fayed, who  with his two brothers owns Harrods department store. The medals will go on  display at Harrods before Christmas.  </P> <P> Abrahams' adopted daughter, Susan Pottle, said she and her brother, Patrick,  decided to sell the collection because it was languishing in a desk drawer.  </P> <P> "It seemed a pity to just leave them there," she said. "We wanted it to go to  someone who will treasure it or to a museum.  </P></p>

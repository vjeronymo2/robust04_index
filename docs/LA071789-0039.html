			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> "The only thing you can do is wait and see," said Danny Wells, a district union  representative in Madison, W. Va., as coal miners in Appalachian mines were  deciding whether to follow their Midwestern and Southern colleagues back to  work. Wildcat walkouts by as many as 46,000 miners supporting 1,900 striking  Pittston Coal Group workers have idled much of the nation's coal production  since June 12. The number of wildcat strikers fell to 37,000 last week. And  16,000 -- all the miners in Alabama, Illinois and Indiana and some in Kentucky  -- are expected to return for their next scheduled shifts. Union leaders in  Pennsylvania said they believed the 7,500 miners in their state would return by  today. That put pressure on miners in West Virginia, Ohio and Tennessee.  </P></p>

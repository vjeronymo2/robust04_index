			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Head of Kidder Peabody replaced by GE General Electric yesterday replaced Mr Michael Carpenter as chairman and chief executive of Kidder Peabody, its troubled securities subsidiary, in a move intended to shore up sagging confidence in the firm on Wall Street. Mr Dennis Dammerman, GE's finance director, has taken over full-time management of the firm. GE also created the additional post of president and chief operating officer at the securities company for Mr Denis Nayden, an executive vice president at GE Capital, the group's financial services arm. Mr Welch said the management changes had been made to restore confidence in Kidder, which had been hit by reports of financial difficulties and questions over GE's support for the business. He added that the firm had lost Dollars 30m on its mortgage-backed securities business since the end of March, a figure which is lower than most rival dealers had speculated. Kidder was rocked by the discovery two months ago of what it says were fictitious profits of Dollars 350m created by the head of its government bond trading desk. The trader, Mr Joseph Jett, has said that he acted under instruction from senior Kidder executives. More recently, Wall Street's attention has switched to Kidder's involvement in the mortgage-backed bonds market, where it is the leading firm. These bonds have fallen further than US government bonds during the recent downturn in the fixed income markets. Mr Welch said that Mr Carpenter's resignation was not directly linked to either issue. However, he said that Kidder was beginning to lose business as reports spread that it was in difficulties, prompting GE to take action now. 'Kidder's fundamentals are strong and we intend to provide whatever financial and human resources are appropriate for the firm to realise its potential,' Mr Welch said. GE called Mr Dammerman's involvement at Kidder 'a transition role', and said that Mr Nayden would eventually take over the top job at Kidder. The management shake-up at Kidder comes two months after Mr Welch expressed confidence in Mr Carpenter and his management team in the wake of the phantom profits scheme. The company came close to selling Kidder two years ago, and the recent troubles have led to speculation that it may try again to dispose of the business. Taste of turmoil, Page 30</p>

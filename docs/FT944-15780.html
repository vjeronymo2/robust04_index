			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / People (Names in the News): EvA - audacious optimism Eugene van As, the man who engineered South African paper producer Sappi's Dollars 1.6bn takeover of US company SD Warren last week, has long had a reputation as one of South Africa's most aggressive and audacious businessmen, writes Mark Suzman. An Afrikaner by birth, van As speaks fluent English and German and has been Sappi's chief executive since 1978, becoming executive chairman in 1991. During that period, through a number of large-scale, high-risk deals, he has transformed Sappi from being a mid-size South African company to one of the world's largest paper producers. Known within the company by his initials EVA, van As is widely admired as a tough, no-nonsense manager with a fine grasp of the details of the paper business and an ambitious, but impressive vision of Sappi's future as a global paper company. Nevertheless, there is also suspicion, particularly among shareholders, that he has a tendency to put his empire-building ambitions ahead of their interest. Over the past decade he has consistently made new deals just when more conservative people might be consolidating existing operations. His first big gamble was the construction of a R1.6bn Kraft paper mill in the eastern Transvaal in the early 1980s. Then, in 1988, Sappi picked up Courtaulds' huge southern African pulp interests when the UK company disinvested. In 1990, van As began Sappi's international expansion programme with the purchase of five UK paper mills, and in 1992 bought German-based Hannovier Papier. Despite van As's irrepressible optimism, however, nearly all the deals, and particularly the Hannovier takeover which seriously dented earnings over the past two years, have proved very difficult for Sappi to digest. As a result, the company has at various times been forced to take drastic action, such as suspending its dividend, before returning to an even keel. Now, just as Hannovier appears to have turned the corner, van As has taken his biggest gamble yet, with the highly leveraged Warren deal. Once again, he is confident he has guessed right on the cycle and paid a reasonable price; once again shareholders are nervous of the consequences. But as one analyst notes succinctly: 'Whatever else you may think of him, the guy certainly has got balls.'</p>

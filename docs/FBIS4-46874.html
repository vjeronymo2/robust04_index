			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mykola Petrushenko: "Miners No Longer Ask for </F> Wages. After Meeting Representatives of Donbass's Tsentralnyy  Rayon, Ukraine's President Ordered Creation of a Commission  Which Is Obliged To Undertake Measures in Ten Days To Save the  Coal Sector"]    [Text] Everyone remembers the miners' rebellions and  strikes. The miners shook the government like a pear tree. And,  they gained something for themselves.    It wasn't for the good life that representatives of one of  the most difficult and essential professions left their jobs.  And then, speaking of wages and improved working conditions,  they hoped and believed that the government would really do  something about the sector. Because without energy independence  the young state cannot develop normally.    But the government quenched the conflict without getting  into  the root causes. By hook or crook they managed to raise wages in  the mines. But the government's measures had no effect on the  main thing--stabilization of the operation of the sector. Now it  is on the verge of collapse. This was stated by representatives  of labor collectives of Donbass's Tsentralnyy Rayon at a meeting  with Ukraine President L. Kravchuk.    What's the problem? Payment failures have paralyzed  production. Since the start of the year, the mines have not been  paid 3 trillion karbovantsy [Ukrainian rubles] for coal shipped.    Under these conditions, naturally, the mines can't even  maintain production. And in order to boost production, new mine  faces have to be opened. But there's no money. The work front is  declining, as is the motivation to work.    "It all started with talk about the market," said O.  Kalfakheyan sadly (he's the general director of  Dzerzhynskvuhillya Association). "We have state orders, but we  get nothing for state prices. The businessmen are living off the  state and the working people. We have nothing to work with, the  sector has been artificially paralyzed."    L. Kravchuk:    "What do you suggest to get out of the crisis?"    "The state needs to extend credit."    "What will it be spent on?"    "Settling our debts."    After that brief dialogue, there was a pause in the meeting.  Extending credit means settling the debts of the past; there are  nonpayments for 1992 and 1993. How are people to live now?    There is no easy answer. One good thing, however, is that  the  fault of the state for the sector's problems was acknowledged.  And the next step was taken: the government cannot just put out  the fire, it has to draw up an integrated plan to solve the  sector's crisis. In the presence of the miners, L. Kravchuk  created a commission to study the situation and draw up specific  proposals. It is supposed to submit a concrete program of action  in 10 days.    Everything seems to be fine and logical. But I should like  to  make this comment. None of the troubles in the coal sector,  which is so essential to Ukraine's economy, took shape  overnight. The government failed to act.    The idea of meeting with the miners didn't come up on the  day  of the meeting, either. Hence, the commission could have been  created earlier so that its proposals could have been discussed  at the meeting, but this was not done. Time is being lost, and  problems are getting worse. We don't seem to know how to look  ahead. We operate on the principle, "The peasant doesn't cross  himself until he hears the thunder."</p>

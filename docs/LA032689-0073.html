			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDYING THE DOLPHINS  </P> <P> Some new luxury hotels are capturing dolphins and placing them in concrete  pools under the pretense of "scientific study." Having 100 people a day swim  with these captive dolphins is a study of their response to stress. The best  environment for the study of dolphins, however, is in the open ocean, where the  dolphins can swim away if they like. As a bonus, they don't need to be fed dead  fish and don't need to be medicated for the stress that captivity creates.  Dolphins are sensitive social beings that are interdependent and interactive  with others within their group, which can number in the hundreds.  </P> <P> To hold dolphins captive under any condition is wrong. To keep dolphins in a  hotel lagoon is immoral. Last summer I spent an amazing week with the Wild  Dolphin Project, under the direction of researcher Denise Herzing. She has been  researching the same family of wild, free dolphins for four years. If one is  interested, one can arrange to join Herzing for a week aboard the Wild Dolphins  Project research vessel. The project can be contacted at P.O. Box 12141, Lake  Park, Fla. 33403-0141.  </P> <P> CHRISTOPHER W. TRAUGHBER  </P> <P> San Pedro  </P></p>

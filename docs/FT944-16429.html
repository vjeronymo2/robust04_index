			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Pru may buy stake in Thai insurer Prudential, the UK's largest life insurance company, is holding talks about its first significant acquisition in the Asian insurance market, a 24.9 per cent stake in Thai Sethakit Life Assurance. TS Life is the second smallest of the 12 Thai insurance companies and has a market share of about 1 per cent. Its market capitalisation is Pounds 37m. Rules in Thailand do not allow Prudential to acquire a stake of more than 25 per cent in TS Life. Morgan Grenfell Thai Company, financial adviser to TS Life, said existing shareholders had provisionally agreed to sell their shares at Bt65 each and that the sale should be completed next month. If it is, Prudential will provide TS Life with technical support, international expertise, new product development, computer systems, training, marketing and management skills. TS Life noted that the Thai insurance market has experienced recent growth of more than 20 per cent a year. 'With increasing pressure to liberalise the Thai insurance market, we believe TS Life is now well positioned to compete with new foreign entrants to the market and to expand as the market develops. Expansion into regional markets is also a possibility,' it said. Mr Mick Newmarch, Prudential's chief executive, has identified Asia as one of the key growth areas for the company. Most of its expansion in the region, however, has been through organic growth of long-standing operations in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore. The company has also entered the Malaysian market. Last year, Prudential opened an investment management office in Hong Kong to handle regional investment activities. It has also opened three representative offices in China - in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. This is the first step towards obtaining licences to sell insurance products in China. According to Prudential's annual report, Asian activities are providing some of the most rapid growth of all its operations. New premium income from Hong Kong in 1993 rose 43 per cent from the 1992 level, while that from Singapore rose 18 per cent.</p>

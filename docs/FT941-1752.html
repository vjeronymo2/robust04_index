			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Creditors come out in favour of Brazil Brazil yesterday won approval from bank creditors to close its Dollars 52bn (Pounds 35.6bn) commercial debt restructuring, without the formal support of the International Monetary Fund. Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citibank and chairman of the bank steering committee, said that creditors holding more than two-thirds of the debt had agreed to waive the IMF's involvement. The deal needed 66 per cent approval to go ahead. 'This is the quickest waiver approval I've ever experienced,' Mr Rhodes said. Banks had until the end of today to agree the waiver, he said. The waiver became necessary after the IMF last week refused to grant Brazil a stand-by loan, apparently reflecting concern about the viability of the country's anti-inflation measures. The usually appalling traffic in Sao Paulo, South America's largest city, was even worse yesterday due to a series of strikes protesting against the government's anti-inflation measures. Metalworkers from Sao Paulo's main car plants blocked motorways in the south of the city while services on the underground railway were delayed for two hours. Workers complained that the government's latest attempt to tackle inflation, through the introduction of a new currency later this year, was damaging their purchasing power. Conditions returned to normal by late morning.</p>

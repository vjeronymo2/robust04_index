			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Ailing Tokyo contractor in talks with home-builder A LEADING Japanese home builder, Misawa Homes, is negotiating with an ailing contractor, Ishihara Construction, over a rehabilitation plan. The scheme is likely to include the taking of a 20 per cent stake in Ishihara which has been weakened by links to failed property developers. The negotiations reflect the reluctance of Japanese banks to allow leading clients to fail. Ishihara is listed on the second section of the Tokyo exchange, and its bankers, including Mitsubishi Trust and Mitsubishi Bank, had apparently been seeking a partner to assist in its restructuring. Misawa Homes has remained strong in spite of the downturn in Japan's property market over the past year. Mr Fumichika Ishihara, the president of Ishihara Construction, said the Misawa group was the most likely of four candidates that have sought a capital tie-up with his company, which has debts estimated at Y110bn (Dollars 863m). Ishihara Construction was closely linked to Kyowa Corporation, a bankrupt steel frame builder and property developer which was at the centre of a political scandal last week for its large donations to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Mr Fumio Abe, a former Japanese cabinet minister, was arrested for allegedly taking bribes from Kyowa, which had collapsed owing more than Y200bn in late 1990. Ishihara had guaranteed Y21bn of Kyowa's outstanding debt and has been obliged to put up three Japanese properties and another in Malaysia as collateral for the debt. The contractor had also guaranteed loans totalling Y4.6bn for Ohira Sangyo, another failed property developer, Tokyo-based Ishihara incurred increased debt through its dealings in property development just before the Japanese property market weakened two years ago. It plans to allot new shares to its creditors, who, aware that Ishihara is backed by its banks, are likely to agree to postpone repayment deadlines.</p>

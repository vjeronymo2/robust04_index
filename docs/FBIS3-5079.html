			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by industrial reporter Hiroyuki Shioda: "Change </F> Occurring in Cray's Predominant Position in Supercomputers; It  Faces Battle Over Pricing and Paralleling Technology"; third in  a series entitled: "Review of the Four Areas of Japan-U.S.  Friction"]    [Text] "I think Fujitsu has gone too low to win the bid."  And so saying, Yoshikazu Hori, president of Japan Cray Company,  the Japanese arm of Cray Research Company of the United States,  instructed his man in charge of negotiations with government  offices to ask the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] about the deal. This happened when Fujitsu's bid won the  firm its first supercomputer contract under the first 1993  supplementary budget. MITI insisted "there was no problem" with  the bidding, but Cray was not satisfied. Of the 11 sets of  supercomputers bought by the government under the supplementary  budget, six were U.S.-made. As this was more than the five  Japan-made sets, one would have thought this would have  alleviated trade friction, but there was still more trouble  ahead.  <H5>  "Problems in Procurement Procedure" </H5>   In tenders under the initial 1993 budget, Japanese  manufacturers won all four bids to supply supercomputers. In  July last year, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor,  complained strongly about this, warning, "U.S. concern is  mounting." He said he would watch closely procurement done  under the supplementary budgets. Results of procurement under  the first supplementary budget show that even though Cray won  only two, U.S. companies won six altogether. Cray argued that  the reason it failed to win up to five of the contracts, as it  had expected, was the result of problems with government  procedure. President Hori of Japan Cray insisted: "The  technical performance review should be done more strictly,  through the creation of a third-party evaluation agency, and  price ceilings should be set to prevent price competition from  becoming excessive."    Cray is concerned about Fujitsu, which won contracts to  supply four sets in biddings this time around. Take, for  instance, the bidding to supply Tsukuba University Academic  Information Processing Center. In terms of technical  performance evaluation, Fujitsu's product led Cray's slightly,  but was a long way ahead of NEC Corporation's. Fujitsu offered  its product at about 2 billion yen, way below the 3.5 billion  yen cost quoted by Cray and lower, even, than NEC's price of 2.6  billion yen. An executive member of U.S. Cray, who was in Japan  at the time of the bidding, was told of Fujitsu's price and  said: "This is incredible."    NEC managing director Akira Kobayashi said his company  "could  not have anticipated" such a low price. The contract is awarded  on the basis of dividing technical performance points by price.  NEC opted for a low-price bid in view of the known performance  of its product. Fujitsu's product, not only high-performance but  low in price, was a landslide winner. In other projects Fujitsu  has won bids even when it was not the lowest bidder. Chairman  Takuma Yamamoto said the "victory was due to good planning." To  Cray, however, it "looks like a money-losing deal."  <H5>  Domestic Manufacturers Are Cool </H5>   The U.S. Government and Cray had previously insisted that  bidding procedures should be made clear, and that Japanese  Government procurement was not clear enough. Since then,  competition over price has intensified and, as a result, an  ironic situation has developed -- Cray is at even more of a  disadvantage. Japan Cray President Hori said: "If the price  comes down too low, it becomes a precedent, and insufficient  funds will be set aside in the budget for the next round of  procurement."    The first supplementary budget envisaged spending about 30  billion yen on supercomputers, but ended up spending only about  22 billion yen.    Domestic manufacturers have little sympathy for Cray's  position. NEC said: "The technical performance evaluation is  something that should be done by the users, any third-party  review agency is not necessary. Besides, they should not  denounce efforts by manufacturers to bring their prices down."    Fujitsu said: "The United States in its tenders applies the  Buy-American clause, which gives preferential treatment to  U.S.-made products. It does not make sense to complain about  Japanese Government procurements only."    These two Japanese companies -- Fujitsu and NEC -- sell  their  products in the United States, but neither has managed to sell  to government offices.    To find out why Cray has lost its previous market share  within the context of a very good performance overall by U.S.  companies, it is necessary to note that the supercomputer  industry is now undergoing a new wave of technological reform  called "paralleling."    In the field of parallel computers, Cray and Japanese  manufacturers have been laggard. Among the new, rising forces  are Intel and Thinking Machines of the United States. In bids  for parallel computers, three Japanese companies, including  Hitachi Ltd., have participated in government procurement  tenders in cooperation with these U.S. companies. Many  "Japanese-U.S. alliances" have been born, and a Fujitsu official  went so far as to say "Japan-U.S. friction centered on Cray is a  thing of the past."  <H5>  Time To Find Common Ground </H5>   To date, Cray supercomputers have represented the very  essence of U.S. high-technology. And competition between Cray  and Japanese manufacturers who have tried to catch up with its  technological lead has led to friction. But that is coming to  an end, and now Japan and the United States are reaching a state  of equilibrium. An associate professor at a national research  organization said: "Cray's difficulties are now due to its  backwardness in paralleling technology."    Total supercomputer demand in Japan amounts to about 40 to  50  billion yen a year. Even if U.S.-made products took the whole  market, its contribution to reducing Japan's trade surplus would  be small. It is only because the products were thought to be  symbols of high-technology that Japanese and U.S. manufacturers  been at each other's throats. Meanwhile, users have been given  no say. Users in Japan and the United States should get  together and exchange information and discuss procurement  procedures to find common ground for competition between the two  countries.</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Survey of Lanarkshire (7): Illustrious industrial heritage - Clydesdale Development Company focuses on rural areas IT is an irony of Lanarkshire that the town from which it takes its name is far removed in character and some way in distance from the industrialised north of the county on which so much attention is being lavished. Lanark is a market town of 10,000 people set in rolling green countryside where cattle and sheep farmers come to sell their produce and country ladies do their shopping. Yet it has an illustrious industrial history, for it was at New Lanark that the socialist entrepreneur Robert Owen created an industrial community in which the workers' education and health were as important as profit. In the early 19th century New Lanark was a place of pilgrimage for social reformers, statesmen and royal personages. It is now the leading historic tourist attraction in Lanarkshire, where last year 190,000 people paid to see the restored factory and visitor centre, and many more to stroll round the old village, which is progressively being restored, or gaze at the falls of Clyde. New Lanark is now classed as a World Heritage site. Last year Clydesdale Development Company, the local enterprise trust, was able to point to figures showing that between 1979 and 1990 it had the fastest rate of growth for new businesses in Britain, based on VAT registrations which increased by more than 245 per cent, making the largest percentage increase in Britain, well ahead of Corby, Milton Keynes, and Stevenage. The registration of 631 new businesses is thought to be due partly to Clydesdale residents who formerly commuted to Glasgow setting up businesses nearer home. The number of of people working in Clydesdale has grown in the past 10 years from 23,000 to 35,000. The Clydesdale Development Company is chaired by Mr Arthur Bell, who runs Scotland Direct, a successful direct marketing group, from a converted tweed mill in Biggar, south of Lanark. The development company is an enterprise trust which has a franchise from the LDA to offer business services and advice. Its annual budget is about Pounds 500,000. It differs from most other enterprise trusts in Scotland is that it focuses strongly on the rural areas. 'Clydesdale district covers 500 square miles, and 25 per cent of our businesses are in farming,' says Mr Chris Travis, the executive director (check). 'We must stop the decline in farmers' incomes, or the rural infrastructure will run down, and shops and schools will close in a downward spiral.' Together with other bodies it has established Farm Futures, a programme targeted at young farmers who are likely to inherit the family business. The aim is to provide a grounding in forward planning, business management, and new market opportunities, including how to deal with the demands of the supermarket chains. Though much of Clydesdale is over 1,000 feet above sea level and very bleak in winter, part of the Clyde valley near Lanark has for decades been a centre for raising tomatoes in glass houses, thanks to a warm micro-climate. But the industry has been in steep decline and was becoming unable to compete against plentiful Dutch tomatoes. With the Scottish Agricultural College and the Robert Owen Foundation, the Clydesdale Development Company encouraged six of the surviving tomato growers to club together, 'not to out-produce the Dutch but to out-market them,' Mr Travis explains. They now sell under the banner Scotland's Tomatoes and have agreed a price with the supermarkets which has restored a premium to their tomatoes. Revenues this year are 50 per cent above last year's. The development company is now trying to find ways of assisting beef producers. 'We are trying to find an effective marketing approach that will raise returns,' Mr Travis says. It is likely to involve creating a brand, developing a link with an abattoir to produce a quality mark and dealing direct with butchers, cutting out the cattle market. 'Much of our beef is raised in conditions that are close to being organic,' he says. 'That gives us something to work on.' He says that as farm subsidies fall, farmers need a better understanding of market forces, of buying and selling, of costing and pricing, and of the public perception of quality. Taking the work of an enterprise trust into the agricultural community is breaking new ground. 'It is a bit of an uphill struggle,' Mr Travis says. 'The farmers will listen and say they agree with you, but whether they do anything about it . . .'</p>

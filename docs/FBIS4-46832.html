			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Tatarnikov, assistant to the Russian </F> Federation president's representative in Irkutsk Oblast: ""Do  Not Touch Our Gold!"]    [Text] It was said a long time ago that the most  exciting stories in the golden storehouse of world literature  deal with gold--the infamous yellow metal. However, it would be  a mistake to think that they are all inherited from the  past--the time of the conquistadors, "gold fever," or pirates on  the high seas. This is one of the stories set in modern times  which has a plot suitable for an adventure novel.    Irkutsk Oblast holds one of the leading positions among the  regions engaged in gold mining. Most of the gold in the oblast  is extracted in the North--in Bodaybinskiy Rayon, where the  closed-type joint-stock company "Lenzoloto" is located. Until  recently it was a state enterprise--a production association  with the same name. It would probably still be one today if the  pace of privatization had not been stepped up.    On 9 April 1992, Yegor Gaydar, who was the first deputy  chairman of the Russian Federation Government at that time,  decided that the time had come for the "Lenzoloto" PO  [Production Association] to join the triumphal procession of  privatization. On this day the vice premier signed Directive No.  693-r, which ordered that: "The Lena gold mining production  association 'Lenzoloto,' a state enterprise, is to be  transformed into a closed-type joint-stock company. The  'Lenzoloto' Joint-Stock Company is authorized to enlist foreign  investors to finance production development, under the condition  that the amount contributed to the joint-stock company's charter  fund by foreign investors does not exceed 31 percent."    However, a minor violation of the law slipped into the  government decree, either because of carelessness by the  officials who prepared it or an oversight by the vice premier  himself.    From a letter sent by the Russian Federation procurator  general to the chairman of the Russian Federation Government,  V.S. Chernomyrdin, on 6 September 1993:    "The directive from Ye.T. Gaydar conflicts with the  Basic Provisions of the Program for Privatization of State and  Municipal Enterprises in 1992, in effect at the time of its  issuance, which authorized their transformation only into  open-type joint-stock companies in the process of their  privatization."    At first glance, the violation does not seem so terrible.  However, subsequent events once again confirmed the words of the  classic--that the slightest violation of the law is a hole which  the bourgeoisie will inevitably rush through.    On 28 August 1992, Petr Mostovoy, the first deputy chairman  of the Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee on the Administration  of State Property], issued his own directive to execute this  Russian Federation Government directive--under the number 392-r:  "The Lena Gold Mining Closed-Type Joint-Stock Company  `Lenzoloto' is to be established with the participation of a  foreign investor--the 'Star Technology Systems Limited'  corporation--and the Lena Gold Mining Production Association  `Lenzoloto' is to be abolished."    Petr Mostovoy's directive raised a number of puzzling  questions in the organs of state authority of Irkutsk Oblast:  Why did one of the largest enterprises in the oblast's North  have to be abolished and why was the foreign "Star" Corporation,  which was given the honor of becoming a founder of one of the  largest gold mining enterprises, glorified in this way?    There were even more questions when the founding documents  of  the new joint-stock company arrived in the oblast in October  1992.    Its founders--the Russian Federation Goskomimushchestvo and  the "Star" Corporation, registered in Hong Kong under laws of  the British Virgin Islands--set the objective of developing  placer gold deposits, and most importantly, the "Sukhoy Log"  Gold Deposits, the largest in Russia. At the same time, the  "Star" Corporation made the commitment to put 250 million U.S.  dollars into the charter fund: $125 million of this sum were to  be entered in the first year after registration (which took  place in September 1992) and the remaining $125 million were to  be added over a 3-year period.    From the report signed by "Star" President (I. Makni)  and "Star" Director (L. Mor):    "`Star Technology Systems, Limited,' British Virgin  Islands (because of its favorable taxes):    "Capital: 1 million U.S. dollars.    "Financing of projects in Russia from 1990 to 1992: 7  million U.S. dollars."    And here is another document.    From a statement signed by Academician Boris Laskorin  of the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences]:    "Taking into account that advanced technologies have  been developed in Russia to extract gold from ore and technical  and economic feasibility has been established for a mining  complex on the basis of the `Sukhoy Log' Deposits, we believe  that there is no need to enlist any foreign firms for the  `Sukhoy Log' Deposits.    The Goskomimushchestvo, it would seem, has one significant  argument in this regard--Russia does not have the money to  develop such a project, but "Star" is providing no less than  $250 million.    But this is only at first glance. The fact is that the  "Star"  firm is realy not such a kind "transatlantic rich uncle."    Initially, "Star" made the commitment to invest 250 million  U.S. dollars in the operation, but a year had not gone by when  Petr Mostovoy and "Star" President (I. Makni) signed a protocol  changing the founding agreement:    "`Star' is taking part in the formation of founding  capital by transferring funds in foreign currency evaluated at  625 million rubles [R]. Within 12 months from the date of the  company's registration, `Star' will pay no less than 50 percent  of its share in the founding capital in the amount of R312.5  million in foreign currency at the Central Bank exchange rate in  effect on the date of the company's registration."    The question arises: why was there any need to make a fuss  by  enlisting a foreign investor for the sake of such conditions?  Especially as the founding capital for the "Lenzoloto" AO  [Joint-Stock Company] has not been organized, although a year  and a half has gone by since the enterprise was registered.    From a letter sent on 4 November 1993 by the Russian  Ministry of Security:    "The Russian Ministry of Security has repeatedly  informed the Russian Federation Government about this matter and  expressed its opinion on the inadvisability of enlisting the  `Star Technology Systems' firm as a founder of the `Lenzoloto'  AO under conditions of the founding agreement, which are harmful  to Russia's interests and grant the joint-stock company the  right to monopoly development of the `Sukhoy Log' Gold  Deposits."    And what is most astonishing is that those who initiated the  plan to develop "Sukhoy Log" did not even get around to  coordinating the project with the oblast authorities and the  Bodaybinskiy Rayon administration, on whose territory the  natural resources which attracted the attention of the "Star"  firm are located.    The collective of the "Lenzoloto" Production Association was  bypassed as well.    From a letter sent by the procurator general of the  Russian Federation on 6 September 1993:    "In accordance with the privatization plan approved by  the Goskomimushchestvo, 21.15 percent of the stock, only 6.9  percent of which is common (voting) stock, is transferred to  members of the labor collective, while the foreign `Star'  company receives 31 percent...    "Taking into account what has been stated, I ask you,  Viktor Stepanovich, to take steps to eliminate the violations  committed when the `Lenzoloto' Production Association was  changed into the `Lenzoloto' Closed-Type Joint-Stock Company and  to bring the formal documents of the government and the  Goskomimushchestvo into conformity with the laws in effect."    In addition to the Office of the Procurator General, the  following concluded that the directives of the  Goskomimushchestvo were not in conformity with Russian  Federation laws: the State-Legal Administration of the Russian  Federation President, the Ministry of Justice, the Management  Administration of the Russian Federation President, the  Roskomnedra [State Committee for Geology and the Use of Mineral  Resources], the Roskomdragmet [Committee on Precious Metals and  Precious Stones], the Ministry of Economics, and a number of  federal departments. But things are not moving, as they say.    In October 1992, the Irkutsk Oblast Soviet held up  implementation of the Goskomimushchestvo's illegal documents in  the oblast's territory, and then appealed to the Russian  Federation Supreme Court for their repeal.    Unfortunately, however, consideration of the case was  delayed. One of the reasons for the delay was the endless  promises by the Goskomimushchestvo that the government was about  to make a decision to resolve all the problems.    A year and a half passed after the oblast appealed to the  court.    From a letter sent by V. Ilyukhin, chairman of the  Committee on Security of the State Duma, to V. Lebedev, chairman  of the Supreme Court, on 30 March 1994:    "The violations of law permitted by the Russian  Federation Goskomimushchestvo are threatening the interests of  the Russian Federation's economic security.    "A number of proposals have been prepared to eliminate  the violations revealed. However, the fact that the case  indicated still has not been considered is impeding their  implementation to a certain extent.    "We would be grateful for your assistance in speeding  up resolution of this case."    It is appropriate in this connection to point out that as  long ago as 29 June 1993, the oblast administration, the Irkutsk  Oblast Soviet, and the Russian Federation President's  representative in Irkutsk Oblast, together with the  Roskomdragmet, the Ministry of Atomic Energy, and the  Roskomnedra, submitted a draft directive to the Russian  Federation Government which provides for the repeal of the  Goskomimushchestvo's illegal documents and brings Y. Gaydar's  directive of 9 April 1992 and the mechanism for financing  development of "Sukhoy Log" into conformity with the law.    Elections to the local self-government organs in Irkutsk  Oblast were held on 27 March 1993. The newly elected head of  administration of the city of Bodaybo. N. Sizykh, petitioned the  court for the Bodaybo administration to take part in the case as  an independent party. The court approved this petition. The next  court session is set for 6 July 1994--enough time for the  Russian Federation Government to heed the opinion expressed by  the Office of the Procurator General and ministries and  departments and put an end to this drawn-out story.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> D. The Banking Agencies' Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FDIC concurs with the Basle Supervisors' Committee determination that the legal status of close-out netting provisions has developed sufficiently to support the expanded recognition of such provisions for risk-based capital purposes. Therefore, the FDIC is proposing to amend its risk-based capital standards in a manner consistent with the Basle Supervisors' Committee's proposed revision to the Basle Accord. The FDIC's proposed amendments would allow banks to net the positive and negative market values of interest and exchange rate contracts subject to a qualifying, legally enforceable bilateral netting contract to calculate one current exposure for that netting contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FDIC's proposed amendments would add provisions to its standards setting forth criteria for a qualifying bilateral netting contract and an explanation of how the credit equivalent amount should be calculated for such contracts. The risk-based capital treatment of an individual contract that is not subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract would remain unchanged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For interest and exchange rate contracts that are subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract under the proposed standards, the credit equivalent amount would equal the sum of (i) the current exposure of the netting contract and (ii) the sum of the add-ons for all individual contracts subject to the netting contract. (As with all contracts, mark-to-market values for netted contracts would be measured in dollars, regardless of the currency specified in the contract.) The current exposure of the bilateral netting contract would be determined by adding together all positive and negative mark-to-market values of the individual contracts subject to the bilateral netting contract. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The current exposure would equal the sum of the market values if that sum is positive, or zero if the sum of the market values is zero or negative. The potential future exposure (add-on) for each individual contract subject to the bilateral netting contract would be calculated in the same manner as for non-netted contracts. These individual potential future exposures would then be added together to arrive at one total add-on amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For regulatory capital purposes, the FDIC would expect that institutions would normally calculate the current exposure of a bilateral netting contract by consistently including  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> all  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> contracts covered by that netting contract. In the event a netting contract covers transactions that are normally excluded from the risk-based ratio calculation_for example, exchange rate contracts with an original maturity of fourteen calendar days or less or instruments traded on exchanges that require daily payment of variation margin_institutions may elect to consistently either include or exclude all mark-to-market values of such transactions when determining net current exposures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed amendments provide that a bank may net, for risk-based capital purposes, interest and exchange rate contracts only under a written bilateral netting contract that creates a single legal obligation covering all included individual rate contracts and that does not contain a walkaway clause. In addition, if a counterparty fails to perform due to default, insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or similar circumstances, the bank must have a claim to receive a payment, or an obligation to make a payment, for only the net amount of the sum of the positive and negative market values on included individual contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FDIC's proposal requires that a bank obtain a written and reasoned legal opinion(s), representing that an organization's claim or obligation, in the event of a legal challenge, including one resulting from a failure to perform due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to default, insolvency, bankruptcy, or similar circumstances, would be found by the relevant court and administrative authorities to be the net sum of all positive and negative market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> values of contracts included in the bilateral netting contract. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The legal opinion normally would cover (i) the law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is chartered or the equivalent location in the case of noncorporate entities and, if a branch of the counterparty is involved, the law of the jurisdiction in which the branch is located; (ii) the law that governs the individual contracts covered by the bilateral netting contract; and (iii) the law that governs the netting contract. The multiple jurisdiction requirement is designed to ensure that the netting contract would be upheld in any jurisdiction where the contract would likely be enforced or whose law would likely be applied in an enforcement action, as well as the jurisdiction where the counterparty's assets reside.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued Interpretation No. 39 (FIN 39) relating to the ``Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts.'' FIN 39 generally provides that assets and liabilities meeting specified criteria may be netted under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, FIN 39 does not specifically require a written and reasoned legal opinion regarding the enforceability of the netting contract in bankruptcy and other circumstances. Therefore, under this proposal a bank might be able to net certain contracts in accordance with FIN 39 for GAAP reporting purposes, but not be able to net those contracts for risk-based capital purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A legal opinion could be prepared by either an outside law firm or in-house counsel. If a bank obtained an opinion on the enforceability of a bilateral netting contract that covered a variety of underlying contracts, it generally would not need a legal opinion for each individual underlying contract that is subject to the netting contract, so long as the individual underlying contracts were of the type contemplated by the legal opinion covering the netting contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTERCULTURAL ETIQUETTE  </P> <P> I thoroughly enjoyed "Intercultural Etiquette." I especially wish to praise  Jacquelyn Mitchell for creating the course for her Afro-American studies  program at UC Davis.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, I do object to the implication that cultural borrowing is  essentially insensitive to the natives. For one thing, if I hadn't seen the  movie "10," I would have not been aware of the unique African-style braids. It  has never occurred to me that the producers or Bo Derek were being racist or  poking fun at another culture.  </P> <P> GERALD P. LUNDERVILLE  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

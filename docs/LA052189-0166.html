			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TRIP 'FROM POVERTY TO MILLIONAIRE' TAKES JUST 1 SPIN  </P> <P> They say money can't buy happiness, but Richard Pruneau would argue the point.  </P> <P> The 26-year-old plumber, who grew up in Thousand Oaks, said he went from rags  to riches Saturday, winning $1 million in the state lottery's "Big Spin."  </P> <P> "I'm amazed. I mean, I can't believe I went from total poverty to millionaire,"  Pruneau said in a telephone interview from Sacramento.  </P> <P> Pruneau said he had been unemployed for several months before moving to Orange  County a month ago to take a job. While out of work, he stayed for a time in a  San Bernardino County motel room; "welfare paid the bill," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Has 2 Daughters  </P> <P> Pruneau said he is married with two young daughters, including 6-month-old  Hillary, who was born blind.  </P> <P> After his lottery winnings are taxed, Pruneau will get about $40,000 a year for  20 years, which will "definitely help me take care of her on a long-term basis  and get the things we need for her," he said.  </P> <P> In addition, Pruneau said he will "get a business going and pay back all my  debts."  </P> <P> Pruneau said he "just wrote a check for my last $40" to pay for a videotape of  his "Big Spin" appearance. The television show was taped Saturday morning for  broadcast later in the day.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bought 1 Ticket  </P> <P> His appearance on the "Big Spin" resulted from his purchase of a single ticket  for the lottery's Cash Register game. The ticket paid $100 and allowed Pruneau  to enter a drawing for a chance to become a "Big Spin" contestant.  </P> <P> Word that his name had been drawn came last week when he was out changing the  gasket on the oil pan of his truck.  </P> <P> He knew something was up when he returned and his brother and sister were  jumping up and down. "Normally, I don't even get a hello," he said.  </P> <P> "Big Spin" contestant Jennifer Byrnes, 20, of Calabasas, was not as lucky as  Pruneau, but she said her $40,000 prize was "awesome" nonetheless.  </P> <P> The minimum "Big Spin" award is $10,000. "I was counting on $10,000 so no  matter what I won, I'd be really happy," Byrnes said.  </P> <P> She added: "Forty thousand dollars is a lot of money for me; I'm going to  hopefully be able to put . . . a down payment on a condo or house."  </P></p>

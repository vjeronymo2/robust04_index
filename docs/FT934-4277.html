			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Lossmaking Ossory unveils rescue package Ossory Estates yesterday unveiled proposals for a financial restructuring, a placing and open offer to raise Pounds 8m net and the acquisition of a portfolio of properties. The company also estimated that pre-tax losses for the year to end-June would total not more than Pounds 41m. That included a write-off of investments amounting to Pounds 22m, the writing down of properties under development totalling Pounds 2m and interest and other charges accounting for Pounds 16.2m. The directors believed the restructuring proposals represented the 'only realistic prospect' for shareholders obtaining any value from their holdings of ordinary shares. They warned that if the proposals were not implemented and no alternative proposal put forward Ossory would be unable to continue trading with the result that it would have no alternative other than 'insolvent liquidation, administration or receivership'. The placing and open offer would involve the issue of 835m new ordinary 1p shares at 1p each. The maximum number of shares available for subscription under the open offer would be 408m with clawback terms of 9 new ordinary 1p shares for every two 25p shares held. The 25p shares would then be sub-divided into one new 1p share and one 24p deferred share. Following the reorganisation the Pounds 73m deficit on the profit and loss account would be reduced to about Pounds 25m via the cancellation of the deferred shares and the share premium account. The acquisition is of six commercial and industrial properties for Pounds 2.83m in cash and shares. The shares closed 1p lower at 1 3/4p.</p>

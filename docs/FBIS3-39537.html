			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yalcin Ozer from the "Commentary" column: "The Rise of </F> Bosnia and of the Prosperity Party"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The fact that the Prosperity  Party [PP] is becoming stronger and stronger is more apparent  every day. Surveys show that the PP is either the first or  second mass party in Turkey today.    The old political balances are disappearing in Turkey in  1994. The wedding ceremony held at the Swiss Hotel yesterday was  in a sense a metaphor for the True Path Party-Motherland Party  [TPP-ANAP] wedding. President Demirel and ANAP leader Yilmaz  were there together, symbolically announcing that there are no  longer any differences between the two parties.    The present ANAP is not Ozal's ANAP. Instead, it is a  "Demirelized" center party that is more like the TPP. The PP  stands opposite these two intermingled parties.    What about the Social Democratic Populist Party [SDPP]?    This pretentious party of the past has abandoned most of its  political claims and is now a mere fourth party. We are aware  of it now because it is a coalition partner, but it is hard to  believe that it will find any supporters other than a few  marginal artists in the future.    At present, the total votes that can be collected by the  rightist parties stands at 70 percent. The number of votes the  leftist parties (if you still consider Bulent Ecevit the leader  of a leftist party) can receive has gone down to 25 percent.    What do we see behind these figures?    While he was prime minister, Demirel had 129 corruption  files  prepared against the ANAP. He had the assembly approve some of  them and had them sent to the Constitutional Court. The ANAP  did not lag far behind. It sued the TPP for corruption as in  the ILKSAN case.    The SDPP turned out to be more "productive" in corruption  cases than the TPP or ANAP. Rumors of corruption and bribes in  SDPP municipalities were rampant. The SDPP and the leftist  parties in general lost votes as a result of these rumors.    This situation gave a rare trump card to the PP. Due to the  moral crisis they were in, the three parties, which are not very  different from each other, made the PP the favorite party.    Of course this is not the only reason why the PP is the  favorite party today. In the new conditions, a reason which we  can call a historically dialectic reason, has also played a  role: The Bosnia-Herzegovina situation has deeply wounded the  Turkish nation. The caring attitude of the PP toward this  problem cannot even be compared to the attitude of the other  parties.    Our center parties are not able to bring clear solutions to  the problems Turkey faces. The winds of change in the world  cannot go beyond the rigid central bureaucracies of these  parties.    Faced with the PP's unbelievable rise, certain circles are  trying to wage the struggle outside the democratic framework:  they claim that the PP is getting aid from outside Turkey and  that the prosecutor is investigating these charges. Such tricks  also play a role in helping the PP rise to the top.</p>

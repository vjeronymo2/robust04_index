The declaration,  which was written by five UN experts, gives Indians worldwide  the right to self determination. Based on the history of  African countries, the Brazilian Government believes such a  concept may give the Ianomami Indians, for example, the right to  declare independence from Brazil.    The Brazilian concern is considered exaggerated by the  Indian  defense organizations present at the meeting. In a long speech  Ambassador Gilberto Saboia clearly established that Brazil  intends to oppose this or any other concept that places national  sovereignty in jeopardy.    "The Declaration of Indian Rights must be simple, balanced,  and realistic," the ambassador said.    Gilberto Saboia reminded the representatives at the meeting  that such a declaration will have to be approved by consensus.  That is, without the consent of Brazil the whole text will not  be approved.    Saboia said Brazil does not accept the expression  "indigenous  peoples" in the draft declaration, for the same reason: The word  "peoples" is historically linked with independence.    The ambassador said: "Statements like that in the draft  declaration may prompt ambiguous interpretations that are out of  keeping with international law, the principles and objectives of  the UN Charter, and the basic principles of the sovereignty of  state and territorial integrity,"    Saboia wants UN experts to clarify the meaning and extent of  the principles described in the draft declaration which  guarantees the rights to autonomy and self government for  Indians. The controversy continues because the process of  preparing the declaration does not end there: Before approval,  the declaration must go through a series of negotiating channels  within the United Nations and cannot be approved by the UN  General Assembly without the agreement of members like Brazil.</p>

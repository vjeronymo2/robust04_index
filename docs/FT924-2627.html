			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Lonrho - Rowland's Exit: Observer looks to be in secure hands THE PRESENT ownership of the Observer seems to be secure for the next few years, in spite of Mr Tiny Rowland's plan to sell half his 15 per cent stake in Lonrho. All the signs are that Mr Rowland intends to stay on for three more years. As long as Mr Rowland retains his influence at Lonrho it is unlikely that the ownership of the Observer will change. The Guardian has repeatedly expressed interest in the loss-making Sunday news-paper, and earlier this year there were serious talks. But such talks have always foundered on the opposition of Mr Rowland. He has in effect made the paper unsaleable by setting a very high value on it. The newspaper is now believed to be losing between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m a year, losses that have been reduced from about Pounds 15m last year following a cost-cutting programme. Circulation has held up above 500,000 despite the effects of the recession and increasing competition in the broadsheet Sunday market. Uncertainty about the Observer was, however, increased by comments in Mr Rowland's statement about selling his shares. He said that the board intended to elim-inate intangible assets in Lonrho's financial state-ments for the year ended September 30. The statement also said that the Lonrho directors were of the opinion that there had been no permanent diminution during the year in the current cost of the remaining Lonrho title - the Observer. Its intangible value is in the books at Pounds 67m. Senior Lonrho figures suggest this makes a sale less likely because, as it would almost certainly realise less than Pounds 67m, the difference would go straight to the profit and loss account. Others see the shedding of intangibles as the first stage in clearing the decks for an eventual sale of the paper.</p>

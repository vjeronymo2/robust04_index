			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Food and Wine: Even the maggots liked the cheese - On Page VII, Nicholas Woodsworth names Corsica as one of his Top 10 travel tips for 1994. Here, he eats with a Corsican peasant Corsica has a rich culinary tradition. And, like most true Mediterranean cooking, the island's fare remains close to its peasant roots. What counts is not richness or sophistication of style but fine, fresh ingredients prepared simply to bring out the best of natural flavours. Is anyone, at this point, still reading? The trouble is, this kind of theme pops up so often in trendy cookbooks, Sunday supplements and Keith Floyd cookery programmes that it has ceased to mean very much. It is now a quarter of a century since Elizabeth David began telling us about the wonders of southern ingredients prepared freshly and without pretention. What she had to say is, of course, all true, but bang on about anything long enough and we cease to hear it. So, I am not going to bang on. This is not a discourse on freshness, simplicity and the gastronomic legacy of a rich Mediterranean peasant tradition. It is merely an account of a Corsican meal - one shared with a peasant - that brought home to me these truths in a fresh and simple manner. I first heard of Pierre Milanini through his cousin, Jeannot, as we sat in an elegant little seaside restaurant in the Corsican resort of Porto Vecchio. We were not discussing food, but the insular Corsican mentality. For an island people, Jeannot was telling me, Corsicans are surprisingly out of their element along their rich coasts. Over the millennia the island has suffered repeated attack and invasion by sea, and Corsicans have survived by seeking the security and peace of the rugged interior - with time, the inhospitable mountains have become their preferred home. I looked around the restaurant as he talked. The place was full, not of Corsicans but of end-of-summer visitors who came from everywhere. The food was good, but it might have come from anywhere. 'If you want another Corsica,' Jeannot suggested, 'why don't you go inland to Quenza? I have a cousin who runs a stable and gite d'etape on the mountain behind the village. He's a bit of a hermit, slightly eccentric, and a real Corsican. And he knows how to cook - every last thing he serves he grows, raises and prepares himself.' Who could resist a suggestion like that? I left for the hills early the next morning. Guests would have to know about Pierre Milanini's place to find it. Gites d'etapes exist only in the wilder areas of France, and usually serve a specialist clientele of cold and hungry ramblers, mountain climbers and campers. Their isolation, though, does not affect their quality; they are often the last strongholds of authentic regional cuisine. The medieval village of Quenza sits lost in a ring of high peaks and hills. I found the gite hidden on a tiny, winding road that disappeared into the chestnut forests above the village. The place was marked only by the well-groomed horses that milled around a paddock beside a ramshackle stone house. At first, Pierre did not want to know about one more diner. He had closed his gite for the season, he said, shaking his long locks and thick grey beard back and forth. And he was busy preparing his annual trip to Ajaccio - five days through the mountains on horseback. Food, he told me, should be no more hurried an affair than travel. But when he saw me admiring the ripe, red tomatoes growing in the large garden behind the paddock, his pride got the better of him. 'They are the finest tomatoes around,' he beamed. 'Same as the rest of my garden, same as my fruit orchard: no pesticides, no herbicides, no chemical fertilisers - just plenty of good, aged horse manure.' I was welcome to try his tomatoes, he said, if I did not mind sitting down to whatever else he could put together at short notice. Pierre's house was rustically chaotic. Muddy riding boots stood drying in one corner of a huge, unswept fireplace, mountain walking boots in the other. There was a shotgun leaning against the wall and an ammunition bandolier slung over the back of a threadbare armchair. In the chair itself, a hunting dog lay snoozing with its paws in the air. Three more lay prone on the floor. Half a dozen cats were lounging on the long, scarred farm table that took up most of the room. 'Dehors]' Out] he roared, and the animals disappeared in a flurry of hair and dust. 'I love animals,' he said, slinging one last kitten out the door. 'I have 30 horses, 60 pigs, 30 cows, eight dogs and 11 cats. I'd have more horses if I could afford them, but the damned things don't pay for themselves.' Pierre talked as he put an iron pot of soup on the stove and began slicing tomatoes. An exemplar of Corsican insularity, he is a purist, a die-hard traditionalist, a hold-out against modern civilization. As a cook he mistrusts all food additives, any kind of pre-mixed concoction or preparation, all time-saving devices, any corner-cutting cooking method. He has lived all his 60 years in Quenza. When he grew up, producing food was a question of survival. He spent drought-ridden summers watering chestnut trees - without chestnut flour, there was no bread to see the family through the winter. Wheat flour was an unaffordable luxury. 'Life was difficult then,' Pierre laughed. 'We just didn't know it.' We sat down to plates of sliced tomatoes. Mine were accompanied by mild onion rings, parsley and olive oil, all home-produced, all delicious. Pierre's were accompanied by nothing but a shake of salt. 'We use too many ingredients in our meals,' he growled. 'Add enough and you kill the taste of what you are trying to eat. People like garnishes and dressings, but do they know what tomatoes are really like?' Perhaps he had a point, I thought, as I sliced through a tomato with my fork. 'And for God's sake, man, don't massacre them]' Pierre added. 'Tomatoes are delicate things. Here, use this.' He passed over a clasp knife with a long, mean-looking, blade, the kind you imagine gangsters stick into each other. I sighed. No one had instructed me on the use of dining implements since nursery. A minute later, though, I was learning yet another lesson - to cut bread in the peasant fashion. Copying Pierre, I held his fresh-baked bread - a round loaf the size of a small bicycle tyre - against my chest and drew my knife gingerly through the crust towards me. One slip, I thought, and I shall stab myself fatally. I was gaining confidence, however, by the time the soup bowls arrived. In them was a thick, fragrant vegetable minestra, simmered for hours with herbs and chunks of smoked, salted pork, and wonderful to eat with large slices of crusty bread and red wine. Again, though, Pierre brought me back to essentials. 'All these seasonings and extras are fine - I like thyme, bay and garlic as much as anyone. But there is just one great secret. It is the onion. Without the onion, you can do nothing; with it, you can do anything. It is the point of departure.' Pierre was emphatic. I was not going to argue. It seemed as good a world view as any. Silently, we drank in praise of the onion. But I did not remain silent a few moments later when I cut off a thick slice from the leg of cured ham Pierre had set on the table. The flavour was superb. 'Nothing but salt and pepper in that. I slaughtered, cured and hung that pig five months ago. No flavouring, no herbs, no spices. The taste is in the flesh itself. Elsewhere, pigs are penned up. On this island, pigs wander round all day eating chestnuts and acorns. Come and look at what we make best in Corsica.' In a cool, dark, dry room off the main house, Pierre showed me the produce to which he gives his greatest attention. Hanging from hooks on the ceiling were hams; coppe sausages made from pig's necks; lonze from their filets; and figatelli - smoked sausage from their liver, heart and kidneys. And so to cheese. Mysteriously, Pierre kept his soft ewe's cheese in a covered pot and, even more mysteriously, insisted on spreading it on a slice of bread for me. It had a sharp, biting taste which I enjoyed - until I noticed my cheese refused to stay still. Not only were small yellow maggots wriggling to the surface but, once fallen to the table, they began springing about. I think I blanched. Pierre let go a great haw-haw of laughter. 'Fromage vivant,' he said. 'We call it living cheese. You can't make it, it just makes itself during humid, heavy weather. But when I've got some, people come for miles to eat it. And if we've had a little wine, we like to bet on whose maggots can jump the highest. It's a good time.' I had had a little wine, but I needed a little more before I began to have a good time again. There was coffee; home-made eau-de-vie; more talk about the manners and kitchen customs of Corsica; more eau-de-vie. By the time I left that rough and ramshackle little gite and was heading back down the mountainside to Porto Vecchio, I was in a quandary. I was wondering how I was ever going to have a good time in elegant little seaside restaurants again.</p>

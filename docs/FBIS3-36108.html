In 1993 the total sum of taxes, including the  special fund represented 11-12 percent of the national gross  product. In 1991, it represented 38 percent; in 1994 it is  planned to represent 15 percent-16 percent. The incomes in  state budget in 1993 exceeded the expected amount by 4.3  percent. Referring to the big difference between the  consumption basket and salaries, she said the budget was  calculated taking into the account that the average salary  represents 15 lei and that it will gradually rise afterwards  each three months. Statistics for November show the average  salary represented 63.4 lei for a state apparatus employee, 58.7  lei for transport employee, 84.2 lei for industry employee and  35.5 lei for agroindustrial employee. The minister of finance  pleads for improving the remuneration system. "We have to avoid  the disbalance between 20 lei at some enterprises and 200 lei at  others; this difference has nothing to do with productivity of  labour. Perhaps we shall have to reduce the level of  remuneration to 25 lei minimum salaries; this system is applied  in Japan, Switzerland etc." Claudia Melnic, the only woman in  Sangheli cabinet, states: "It is difficult for a woman to stand  a 16-18 hour work. I hope the new Parliament appoints a man in  this post," concludes the minister of finance.</p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Farmer's Viewpoint: CAP yields heavy crop of confusion - Growers lack the information needed to plan for the coming season AS EUROPEAN grain growers gather this week in Stoneleigh, Warwickshire, for the UK's annual practical demonstration at an event entitled Cereals 92, one topic will dominate their discussions: the incredibly confused implications of the reform package to change the nature of the European Community's common agricultural policy. For although the May 21 agreement by the community's agriculture ministers may be old news for the collective Euromedia, which has long since transferred its attention to fall-out from the negative vote on the Maastrich agreement in the Danish referendum, the details of what exactly has been agreed on farm reform are still far from clear. Indeed about the only thing that is clear is that some of those details affecting UK farmers are still being worked out by European Commission and Whitehall officials and may not become available for some months. Furthermore my inquiries have detected a distinct lack of urgency among some of the officials responsible, who seem to think there is plenty of time. In reality, however, farmers need to make crucial management and purchasing decisions within the next few days and weeks. The primary purpose of the reform package is, of course, to reduce the production of cereals and other surplus commodities across the EC. In simple terms it will cut guaranteed prices by 30 per cent in stages over three years and compensate growers on the basis of average regional yields according to a graduated scale over the period. In order to qualify for the compensation, however, farmers will have to set-aside 15 per cent of their usual acreage of cereals, oil seeds, peas and beans, for which they will also be compensated. In other words growers will have a choice; to set aside the required acreage and take the compensation or to attempt to grow and sell the crops in question at a profit, without benefit of compensation, even though the prices they will receive for them will be substantially reduced. I am bound to say that I believe economics will almost certainly dictate that set-aside will normally be the most profitable policy. It may, however, pay some especially efficient UK farmers on the highest quality, most productive soils to reject EC compensation and to continue to farm all their land for high yields. But they cannot make this calculation with accuracy because no decision has yet been taken on the actual levels of compensation that will be paid. All that is known is that it will rise to an average of Pounds 208 per hectare by 1996 and that for individual farms it will be based on historic average yields across specific regions of the EC, yet to be defined, and that the higher the average the greater will be the level of compensation. In other words, those who have been in the habit of growing average or below average yields within whatever is eventually decided is their region will be fully or even over-compensated for their loss of income compared with the old system, whereas those who usually grew above average crops will be worse off. For the purposes of approximate calculations most UK consultants have used a figure of 5.82 tonnes per hectare (2.35 tonnes per acre) which is the official average yield of wheat for England and assumes that the UK will be divided into four regions; England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Some Ministry of Agriculture officials, however, have suggested that the UK may be divided into up to 14 regions. Should that turn out to be the case the odds are that the compensation for a highly productive region like East Anglia would be increased, making set-aside there more attractive. Conversely lower yielding regions would receive less compensation. There is so far no ruling, however, on the quality standards to be imposed on grain that will be accepted into intervention stores. Rumour has it that these standards may be made more stringent than in the past, thereby limiting the quantities that will qualify for intervention buying and by implication reducing the overall value of the new guaranteed price package. It is not clear whether a farmer can opt to enter the new set-aside scheme whenever he wishes during the three-year transitional period or whether he must join from year one or not at all. If participation from the start is required it may be necessary not to plant 15 per cent of winter wheat and winter barley in the coming autumn so that it is not there to be harvested in 1993. Seed for that which is to be planted will have to be ordered within the next few weeks, however, so it is vital for farmers and the supply trade that the information on which to make management decisions is made available. There seems to be no definitive ruling as to whether the new set-aside should be rotational, in other words on different fields each year, or non-rotational, on the same land for a period of years. If it were allowed to be static farmers would of course select their worst land to leave uncropped every year. That would increase average yields harvested, but it would also limit the effects of set-aside on overall production. Summaries of the reform package that I have seen clearly state that non-food crops may be grown on set-aside land. Does this mean a farmer can grow linseed for oil, which is used in the manufacture of paint, and claim an additional area payment for it under another unrelated EC scheme? I suspect not but it is yet another example of the confusion that characterises this reform package. And I wonder how this complex production-reducing policy, which also includes dairy and beef cattle as well as sheep, will ever be effectively administered and policed across Europe. Only France within the EC, I understand, has an up-to-date register of land and knowledge of who owns what. In the UK farmers are required by the government to complete annual returns giving individual crop area details and stocking levels. That information must be on a Ministry of Agriculture computer somewhere. Some EC member states, however, have no such information. How will they set about introducing such complicated legislation? How will their farmers respond to the mass of forms that they will be required to fill in to claim their compensation? How can British farmers be sure that other countries' governments will comply with the dictats of Brussels as assiduously as their own? Having witnessed for myself recently that Italy has not yet introduced milk quotas eight years after they were supposed imposed across the EC I am somewhat cynical as I look forward to this latest rash of rules. Meanwhile, I have it on good authority that the British Ministry of Agriculture is recruiting people to police its farmers as fast as it is able.</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN BITES TOWN  </P> <P> Regarding Harry Shearer's "Road to Ruin" (Man Bites Town, Feb. 11): Now I  remember the distinctive styles of the light fixtures on Wilshire and Olympic  boulevards. Why didn't I notice then?  </P> <P> The potholes might have been there on the streets for a long time, but when the  powers-that-be finally started repairs, they tackled their work with a  vengeance -- naturally, in the sweltering heat and smog. While the traffic  crawled from three lanes into one, the acrid odor of the asphalt, dust and  exhaust fumes spewed forth into the stagnant air. Work terminated on one  stretch of road, only to commence a little farther on the same boulevard or  adjacent street.  </P> <P> Hey, I live therefore I drive, and I noticed when they did finally fix the  street. I wonder, however, if the reverse is also true: I drive therefore I  live.  </P> <P> MIRIAM ACKERMAN  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: TORRANCE POLICE KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH TRAFFICKERS, BUT  WHAT ABOUT THE DRUGS?  </P> <P> The Torrance Police Department has a problem that every police force would love  to have.  </P> <P> It has busted so many drug buyers and dealers in recent years that it has no  place to put all the confiscated drugs.  </P> <P> The police property room is overflowing with marijuana, heroin, amphetamines  and other assorted drugs. But most of the bounty is cocaine, according police  officials.  </P> <P> In order to accommodate the huge stash, the Police Department asked the City  Council this week to allocate $14,890 to enlarge the property room by 1,650  square feet. (For security reasons police officials would not give the property  room's current size.)  </P> <P> The heavily reinforced room will be completed in about five weeks, city  officials said.  </P> <P> "When they designed this place years ago it never entered anyone's mind that we  would confiscate so many drugs," said police spokesman Sgt. Ron Traber.  </P> <P> The source of these illicit drugs is an emerging wave of international drug  traffickers who have made Torrance and surrounding cities a national  distribution center for their multibillion-dollar industry, according to Lt.  David Marsden, the head of the narcotics detail. Major drug dealers choose to  operate in these cities because of their proximity to freeways, the Port of Los  Angeles and to Los Angeles International Airport, he said.  </P> <P> Not satisfied with simply arresting drug dealers in the city, Torrance  detectives began in late 1984 to work with federal agents in tracing the  international drug supply line as it branched out from the airport and the  port. As a result, Torrance police have made busts and confiscated dope and  money as far away as Santa Ana, East Los Angeles and Orange.  </P> <P> "We just began following the organization and we started crossing paths with  federal investigators," Marsden said.  </P> <P> One benefit for the city is that the Police Department gets a portion of the  seized money. From 1985 to 1988, Torrance detectives impounded more than $3  million in cash, receiving back $350,000 from federal officials.  </P> <P> Proof of just how badly the department needs a bigger drug storage room is in  the figures: from 1984 to 1986 police say they grabbed cocaine worth $28.4  million. Last year the department confiscated about 1,700 pounds of cocaine,  worth about $170 million, Marsden said. During the first three months of 1989,  the department has already matched that amount.  </P> <P> "Eighty-eight was one of our better years," he said. "But every year we are  getting better."

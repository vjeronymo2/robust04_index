			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (1): A worrying indecision - Though the country has enhanced its reputation as a stable influence in a volatile region, Mr Suleyman Demirel, the prime minister, faces growing pressure to deliver on his electoral promise of political and social reform IT MIGHT seem like a sentimental indulgence, but the Turks are greatly flattered that their country, once dismissed as the sick man of Europe, is now held up as a model by the newly-emerging states of central Asia. Today the attentions of these distant cousins is welcome vindication of Turkey's own moves to look west, a policy set in motion by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, which has taken on a new urgency in the last decade. The recognition is particularly timely during a period of deepening troubles at home, where indecision at the centre threatens to spoil Turkey's best efforts at reform. A resurgence of urban terror groups provides a chilling reminder of the political instability which led to the military's intervention in 1980. Inflation is running at more than 70 per cent, with the next wage round looming. More worrying, for the first time, the Kurdish problem challenges the very basis of this nation state carved from the ruins of Ottoman empire. But Turks are great survivors and no politician better illustrates this than Mr Suleyman Demirel, the veteran conservative who became prime minister for the seventh time following the general election last October. His return 12 years after he was ousted by the military - for the second time - is seen as the best hope of restoring the country's fortunes. The coalition government he leads is described by one western ambassador as 'the most reform-minded, liberal and democratic in Turkey's history' - not such an extravagant claim given Turkey's recent political turbulence. Mr Demirel is best described a patronage politician, never more at home than when manipulating the small business and farmer groups which control his DYP party. Today he has also developed a strong instinct for the populist gesture, epitomised by his election slogan to build the police stations out of glass. It remains to be seen whether his fragile coalition has the self-assurance to administer the radical reforms which Turkey so badly needs. The search for consensus between Mr Demirel's True Path party (DYP) and the Social Democratic Populists (SHP) of Mr Erdal Inonu is already proving painfully slow. Even when legislation makes it through cabinet, it is destined for a rough ride in parliament where deputies are enjoying the restoration of those traditional powers largely ignored by the former government. However, with Turkey taking on the presidency of the Council of Europe this month, the prime minister is pushing on a broad front of political and legal reforms before the summer recess. A draft bill on human rights has been submitted. Its main provisions aim to combat the prevalence of police torture, which continues to be the single greatest blight on Turkey's image abroad. Labour laws are being tailored to bring the country in line with International Labour Organisation conventions, while proposals for the country's Kurdish minority follow Turkey's signature of the 1990 Paris Charter on human rights. Mr Demirel faces a number of other challenges, domestic and foreign. On its borders, Turkey confronts growing instability in the Caucasus, with accompanying fears that it could be drawn into defending the rights of Moslem against Armenian. In North Iraq, the evolution of some sort of autonomy for the Kurds might encourage similar aspirations from Turkey's own Kurdish minority. In Europe, Turkey is anxious not to be isolated by the process of economic and political union. The Turks have been associate members of the European Community since 1963, but the current government increasingly accepts that chances of full EC membership in the foreseeable future are slim. At Maastricht, Turkey was offered associate membership of the nine-nation Western European Union defence association, while the Greeks were invited to become full WEU members. Given Turkey's long-standing disputes with Greece, the legacy of more than 600 years of shared history, the government will have a hard task recommending the EC's offer to parliament. There are problems, too, on the EC trade and investment front. More than half Turkey's trade is with the Community and Turkey is still broadly on target for customs union with Brussels in 1996. But there are renewed calls for protectionism from Turkish business groups concerned at the growth in foreign competition which has resulted from liberalisation. There are even those who question whether Turkey will ever implement all the tariff cuts necessary for customs union, particularly given its needs on the revenue side. Turkey alone cannot resolve these issues, and Mr Demirel acknowledges that, to receive a better hearing, Turkey must first tackle a series of domestic problems that increasingly impinges on relations with the world at large. This has been dramatically shown by the Kurdish issue which has taken on an international dimension since allied intervention to help the Iraqi Kurds. Recognising this, the government has embarked on a new policy initiative. A package of economic measures is being introduced to tackle the south-eastern region's high unemployment, while a Kurdish institute and two Kurdish newspapers have been established. The government's junior coalition partners, the SHP, are now openly debating the broader constitutional question of devolved powers as a means to win back moderate Kurdish opinion and undercut support for the rebel Kurdish Workers Party (PKK). The authorities are steering a narrow course, offering liberal reform, yet giving the military an apparent carte blanche to combat the separatists. This could prove a difficult line to maintain as the PKK intensifies its campaign to force further reprisals from the security forces. Mr Demirel has the added disadvantage of a simmering feud with Mr Turgut Ozal, who became president in 1989 after dominating Turkish political life for most of the 1980s. It is on the Kurdish issue that the president has been most vocal, urging Mr Demirel to introduce Kurdish television for the south-east where the majority of Turkey's 10m Kurds live. The president has also used his veto to block key appointments and openly voiced disagreement with the government on a number of issues, particularly on the economy where he has accused the coalition of undoing the good work of the past decade, when he was prime minister. Turkey's economy is in recession. While the population increases by 2.2 per cent every year, Turkey's gross national product grew in 1991 by 0.3 per cent, the slowest rate in more than a decade. This year the picture will be barely improved. While Turkey remains the least taxed of OECD economies, all talk of tax reform flounders. Privatisation of the government's minority shares in privately-run companies still leaves the giant utilities and the other main loss-making enterprises burdening the exchequer. On the key issue of wages, so instrumental in Turkey's export drive in the 1980s, the unions are using SHP support to win further concessions, which economists fear could result in a loss of competitiveness for Turkish industry. The policy indecision is now filtering through to the money markets, where confidence in the Turkish lira looks increasingly shaky. A major intervention by the central bank in the first quarter of this year under-lined the vulnerability of the Turkish lira. Stability will be especially critical now that Turkey is going to the commercial markets for more than USDollars 1bn and floating bonds for the first time since 1990. Meanwhile, Mrs Tansu Ciller has progressively lost her authority as chief economics minister. Her inexperience in dealing with the bureaucracy has surfaced in a series of embarrassing public disagreements with Mr Rusdu Saracaoglu, the central bank governor and one of the few top civil servants to have survived the change of government. Turkey's promised land is some way off. For many of the country's 58m inhabitants, a 10-year diet of economic deregulation has been hard to digest. High inflation is eroding the standard of living of those on fixed incomes. Investment has dropped while foreign and domestic business waits to see whether Mr Demirel has the necessary courage to deal with Turkey's fundamental problems, and allow it to regain its natural position as leader in the region. Unless the government can tackle the question of the economy, all Turkey's problems will get worse. If it fails to do so, even the Central Asian republics could look elsewhere for their model - a prospect that neither the west nor Turkey relishes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News" </F> program]    [Text] Prime Minister Hosokawa, who visited the United  States for the Japan-U.S. summit talks, returned home this  evening. Regarding the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks,  which ended in failure, he indicated an intention to take quick  action to study possible measures to promote market opening  with the aim of reducing Japan's trade surplus and work out own  plans.    After finishing his summit talks with U.S. President Clinton  in Washington, Prime Minister Hosokawa arrived at the Haneda  Airport around 1800 [0900 GMT] today.    From tomorrow, he will be busy dealing with immediate tasks,  such as the final compilation of the government's budget plan  for fiscal 1994 which will be decided on 15 February, Diet  deliberations on the fiscal budget, and reviewing problems of  the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, which remain deadlocked.    As for the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, Prime  Minister Hosokawa, speaking with reporters, said: Since a trade  agreement was 80 to 90 percent complete, I asked the President  at the summit talks to conclude the talks. But President  Clinton proposed not to conclude the talks in that way.    Asked how to deal with the results of the talks, Prime  Minister Hosokawa said: Immediately after returning home, we  will review the problems. We have to use our brains, and Japan  will carry out what it can do. In this way, he said the  government will start studying possible measures to promote  market opening which will help reduce Japan's trade surplus.    Touching on his diplomatic schedule, Prime Minister Hosokawa  disclosed that it is difficult to materialize his scheduled  visit to China in March. He expressed his hope to visit foreign  nations during the consecutive holidays in May. He then said  that European nations and Vietnam are potential countries to  visit.</p>

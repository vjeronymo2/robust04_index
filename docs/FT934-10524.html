			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Germans clamour for Aids tests after blood scandal DOCTORS yesterday called for calm as tens of thousands of Germans swamped switchboards at hospitals and health centres to inquire about Aids tests in the wake of a contaminated blood scandal. 'The panic should stop. This hysteria is completely caused by politicians who have lacked any common sense,' said Mr Karsten Vilmar, president of the German doctors' association. Hospitals and local community health offices were flooded with telephone calls all day as Germans asked to undergo tests for HIV, the virus which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Some doctors said that their patients were postponing operations until they could be guaranteed safe blood. The panic followed statements by public health experts urging people who suspected they might be contaminated to be tested for HIV. Mr Horst Seehofer, the federal health minister, urged anyone treated with blood products since 1980 to be tested. In Lower Saxony, the ministry for social affairs said anyone who had received blood since 1982 should be tested. 'We have had people calling non-stop and all we can do is direct them to the hospital departments which took care of their operations,' a receptionist at the Johannita hospital in Bonn said. 'We can't answer all the calls, there are just too many', said Ms Christa Mueller-Breitkreutz, head of the local health agency in Bonn. Last month, Mr Seehofer announced the federal health office had failed to reveal about 373 cases of HIV infection after transfusions. Most of the cases predate screening for HIV, which began in 1985. But fears have grown after the beginning of a federal investigation into UB Plasma, a German company selling blood. The company was closed by authorities a week ago. Police have arrested four UB Plasma workers, including its chief executive, and charged them with fraud and negligent killing. The company supplied at least 54 hospitals in Germany with plasma. Norway and Italy announced they were removing from the market products distributed by UB Plasma. Health authorities in Switzerland said all blood products there are tested for HIV. 'I would not recommend anyone to take an Aids test unless he or she is very nervous and wants to be calmed,' said Mr Franz Reigel, head of the department of immuno-biological products in the Swiss federal office for health. A German law, introduced in 1985, requires that all blood products be tested for HIV. But UB Plasma is suspected of having violated this requirement because of lack of funds. Health authorities from the German federal states met yesterday to debate greater supervision of companies selling blood products and to make sure information is passed on between states. Doctors across Germany were meanwhile urging people to remain calm. 'The chances of blood being infected with the virus are extremely small. People should also be told this,' Mr Vilmar said. Mr Franz Montgomery of the Marburger Association of independent doctors said: 'There is no reason for mass panic. Worried patients should simply call their usual doctors first.'

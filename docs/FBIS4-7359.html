			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 29 (KCNA) -- Sh. Gungardorj,  Mongolian ambassador to Korea, and his embassy officials visited  the Ssuksom Revolutionary Historical Site.    Here the great leader President Kim Il-song had a historic  consultative meeting with South Korean politicians who had  participated in the joint conference of representatives of  political parties and public organisations in North and South  Korea (April 1948) after the liberation of the country and  showed warm loving care for them.    After going round the United Front tower and historical  relics, the ambassador said he was convinced that the Korean  people's cause of reunification would certainly be accomplished  before long.</p>

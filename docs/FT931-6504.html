			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / US Money and Credit: Corporate issuers take advantage of all-time lows WHATEVER the US stockmarket's qualms about the Clinton economic plan, the bond market is having no such doubts. Bond yields fell to all-time lows last week, and corporate issuers took full advantage, offering record amounts of new paper. The slide in yields occured at the start of the week, with the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rising by  7/8 to 102 7/16 on Monday, and then gaining almost a point and a half on Tuesday. This, in turn, caused the long bond yield to fall below the 7 per cent mark, to 6.93 on Monday, and then drop to 6.82 per cent a day later. This change in sentiment has been swift. Something over a month ago - on January 12 - the long bond yield was standing at 7.47 per cent. Last week's developments can also claim a place in the history books. Since the US Treasury began regular auctions of the 30-year bonds in 1977, the closing yield had never dropped below 7 per cent until this month, and the 6.82 per cent level marked a record low. The market, admittedly, did not hold on to all of these gains for the rest of the week. Midweek, there was a fairly sharp fall in prices, and trading then remained volatile on Thursday, although the closing yield on the day was unchanged at 6.88 per cent. On Friday, dealers paid more attention to the blast under New York's World Trade Center complex - which disrupted trading by several large firms - and the long bond yield ended its momentous week at 6.9 per cent. The question is whether the market can hang on to these levels over the next five sessions, when some key economic statistics will be released. Last week, the bond market cheered the latest consumer confidence data - which showed that the heady 'holiday season' optimism was waning even before the Clinton plan was announced - and shrugged off an upward revision to fourth-quarter gross domestic product data, which suggested that the economy was growing at an annualised rate of 4.8 per cent. This week, it will confront a more fulsome list of economic statistics - from home sales and personal consumption expenditures for January to the February unemployment figures - and some traders suggest that the market could be volatile. The most-closely watched data is likely to be the jobs report, due out on Friday. Here, analysts generally expect signs of a modest strengthening in the labour market, with the increase in payroll employment perhaps repeating January's 106,000 rise. However, the overall unemployment rate is reckoned to show little shift from last month's 7.1 per cent level. Corporate issuers are not waiting to see where the market goes next. They took full advantage of the fall in long-term interest rates last week, issuing billions of dollars-worth of new debt. The biggest outpouring of new paper came of Thursday, when approximately Dollars 5.8bn-worth of issues hit the market, compounding the roller-coaster trading. In terms of new corporate debt offerings, that represented a one-day record, outstripping the Dollars 5.25bn-worth which was issued on January 8 1992. The range of companies taking advantage of the opportunity was wide - from Georgia-Pacific, the wood products group, to Bass America, part of the UK's Bass group. Among the largest borrowers, however, were Dean Witter, Discover, which is being spun off from Sears, Roebuck, with a Dollars 1.5bn offering; the Tennessee Valley Authority, which sold Dollars 1bn of three and five-year bonds; and Wal-Mart Stores, the fast-expanding discount retailer, which raised Dollars 750m by issuing five-year notes and 10-year bonds.</p>

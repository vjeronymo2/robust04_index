			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy said in Czestochowa  that Poland did not need a war at the top. This was his comment  on the conflict between the president and parliament caused by  the Sejm's rejection of Lech Walesa's proposal concerning the  procedure of passing the Constitution.    [Begin Oleksy recording] I do not accept that a war at the  top has started. I am opposed to this. I think that the  president, whose spokesman's statement in a way sent a signal  about such war, will think as I do and will make efforts to  achieve harmonious cooperation between parliament and the  president. Because, I stress, Poland does not need a war at the  top. There have already been too many and they have spoiled too  much. Poland needs reconciliation and common understanding in  order to resolve problems of millions of people. [passage  omitted] [end recording]</p>

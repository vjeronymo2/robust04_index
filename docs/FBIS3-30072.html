Speaking to reporters afterward, Foreign  Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri said this is the first  visit to Thailand by such a high-ranking Mongolian official. He  said there were broad discussions on political, economic, and  social issues between the Thai and Mongolian leaders, who agreed  that those issues have progressed well:    [Begin Prasong recording, in progress] ...called on our  prime  minister. They discussed political, economic, social, and trade  issues. They agreed that Thai-Mongolian relations have  proceeded well and will improve further. He asked us to  consider Mongolia's wish to join ASEAN or APEC [Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation] activities. The prime minister informed  him that he has no objection in principle. Because those  organizations include other countries, though, they will have to  be consulted. On economic and trade issues, both sides agreed  to increase the trade volume. Although the two countries are  located far away from each other, communication between them is  good. If the private sectors of both countries meet, there will  be good prospects for greater trade.    Thailand offered scholarships for Mongolian students and  invited Mongolian monks to study Buddhism in Thailand. A few  Mongolian students and monks are already studying here. We  offered several scholarships for Mongolian students,  particularly in the field of public health. [end recording]</p>

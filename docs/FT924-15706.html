			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (17): An easier life ahead - Consultant's Critique YOU become a computer programmer before you realise it. Spreadsheets are the most common way that people become programmers. If asked, the person concerned would call themselves an accountant or a clerk. Nevertheless, what they do is programming. Sometimes people grapple with - and master - tools that would make the software professional shudder. Mr Julian Soltau of Mercantile and General is a perfect example. He writes programs (which he calls reports) in one of the most primitive languages around. The report language of the system was extremely dated but he had conquered it and made it work for the business. I felt this was a heroic achievement. Mercantile &amp; General have blended the mainframe and the PCs well to suit their requirements. They still have some way to go towards full integration  -they are still manually copying some figures from one to the other. However, the flexibility of the current system has enabled them to keep the personnel head-count remarkably low for the work-load. I suspect that Mr Soltau will be amazed at how far modern query languages have come. The new report writer promised for the system should make his life easier. He will then face the next joy of programming - converting all his existing work over to the new system. Key points from this study: Ordinary people can master complex systems. Even an imperfect system can produce good results if it is flexible. It is more important to have tools than fixed solutions.</p>

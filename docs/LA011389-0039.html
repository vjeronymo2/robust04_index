			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BLACK RENTERS MET BIAS, S.D. STUDY FINDS  </P> <P> Blacks seeking to rent apartments in seven separate sections of San Diego faced  some form of discrimination 40% of the time, according to a covert test of the  housing market presented to the San Diego Housing Commission on Thursday.  </P> <P> In 14 of 35 locations, black test-renters seeking apartments were treated  differently from white test-renters who applied for the same apartments on the  same day, according to the report by the Urban League of San Diego, which  conducted the test for the Housing Commission.  </P> <P> Although housing officials stressed that the test sample was too small to  generalize the results for the entire city, "the survey served its purpose of  giving a very good indication that there is discrimination out there," said  Evan Becker, the Housing Commission's executive director.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wider Testing Needed  </P> <P> Councilman Wes Pratt, the Housing Commission's new chairman, called for wider  testing of the rental market.  </P> <P> The study was part of a larger report by the city's Fair Housing Task Force,  which also concluded that the city has racially and ethnically segregated  housing patterns, an imbalance that is partly attributable to low-income  housing programs enacted by the city.  </P> <P> Poor whites are more broadly scattered about the city than poor minority  groups, and blacks suffer more segregation than Hispanics, who are more  segregated than Asians, the report stated.  </P> <P> Landlords and rental agents discriminated most frequently by misrepresenting  the availability of apartments, the report shows. "White testers were given  immediate dates and shown several apartments, as opposed to the black testers,  who were given two weeks to one month for a unit to become available and a  lesser number of apartments for consideration," the report showed.  </P> <P> At one apartment complex, a white renter was given information on 10 apartments  and told that one was available immediately. A black renter at the same  apartment house was given information on only one apartment and told that none  was available immediately. In all, the study documented 11 cases of  misrepresented apartment availability.  </P> <P> The report also documented five examples of differing levels of courtesy to  white and black renters, ranging from "very subtle to being outright rude."  </P> <P> Two of the discrimination counts pertained to more extensive questioning of  black renters' marital status, and one consisted of a black renter receiving a  much more detailed description of the difficulty of a required credit check.  </P> <P> "Differential treatment is differential treatment," said Joan Dahlin, senior  program analyst on the project for the Housing Commission, who said that such  subtle discrimination has a "chilling effect" on blacks' search for rental  housing.  </P> <P> The survey did not reveal the names of the apartment projects, Dahlin said,  because its purpose was to gather information rather than to enforce  anti-discrimination laws. Under amendments to federal fair-housing laws, which  take effect in March, real violations of statutes could bring fines of as much  as $50,000.  </P> <P> Statistics on fair-housing violations in San Diego kept by the state Department  of Fair Employment and Housing and the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban  Development were unavailable Thursday.  </P> <P> All the violators in the study will be sent follow-up letters and invited to  participate in fair-housing training sessions, said Elizabeth Morris, assistant  executive director of the Housing Commission.  </P> <P> Some violations may have been inadvertent, said D. J. Ryan, executive director  of the San Diego Apartment Assn. and a member of the Fair Housing Task Force.  </P> <P> "I think, with a lot of the discrimination, they don't realize that what they  just did was discriminating," Ryan said. "They have to be informed that, when  you do this and when you do this, it is discrimination."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Projects Throughout City  </P> <P> All the apartment projects surveyed contained more than 20 units. They were in  the Elliott, Linda Vista, La Jolla, University City, Mira Mesa, Mission Valley,  Mission Bay, Pacific Beach, Rancho Bernardo, Rancho Penasquitos and Loma Portal  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The 22-member Fair Housing Task Force was formed by the Housing Commission in  response to a 1986 letter from HUD requiring a more active fair-housing program  in the city of San Diego.  </P> <P> The group found that the number of city census tracts where blacks are more  than 50% of the population declined from nine in 1970 to seven in 1980. But  this was because of the addition of members of other minorities rather than  integration with whites. The white population of those census tracts dropped  during that decade.  </P> <P> The task force also noted that San Diego has no nonprofit or governmental  fair-housing organization to assist state and federal enforcement. Los Angeles  has seven such groups.  </P> <P> The group called for the use of land banking -- a practice under which land is  purchased and set aside for use as the site of low-income housing -- to help  develop public housing for the poor.  </P> <P> It also said the city's commitment to its "balanced community policy," under  which public housing for the poor is scattered around the city, needs  strengthening as the cost of land and housing continues to skyrocket.  </P></p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Yeltsin urged to speed reforms MR Boris Fyodorov, Russia's radical finance minister, said yesterday the west should put pressure on President Boris Yeltsin to pursue rapid market reform following his referendum victory. He said: 'Please urge our president to avail himself of the situation and take faster steps to a market economy ..it is not clear to me that the president is using the advantage afforded by the referendum.' Mr Fyodorov was speaking after Mr Yeltsin appointed an old-style industrial manager, Mr Oleg Soskovets, as first deputy prime minister, instead of boosting the reformist camp in a divided government. He said supporters of radical reform like himself and the privatisation minister, Mr Anatoly Chubais, were urging the Russian leader 'to take decisive steps now because there won't be a second chance.' Mr Fyodorov, who has been instrumental in attracting pledges of large-scale western assistance to underpin his economic reform programme, also said it was essential to replace the chairman of the central bank, Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, whom he accuses of hindering reforms. He suggested the return to the government of radicals like Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister, whose unpopular policies had been 'endorsed by the people' in Sunday's referendum. Some supporters of radical reform claim that Mr Yeltsin will still take steps to boost reformers in the government, but others saw the appointment of Mr Soskovets, following that of conservative Mr Oleg Lobov as another first deputy prime minister, as a bad omen. In the mould of Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister who used to manage the Soviet gas industry, Mr Soskovets was described by a Russian management consultant as belonging to the 'old generation of managers who try to combine old-style management with new ideas'. Meanwhile the Russian parliament continued its witch-hunt of Yeltsin supporters in the media and tried to make a deal with the president on a new constitution. The parliament asked Mr Yeltsin to reconsider his plan to bypass parliament and get a new constitution adopted by a constituent assembly. Parliament's leadership offered Mr Yeltsin a deal whereby he would dilute his draft constitution to give less power to the president, and deputies would approve a compromise version in November. Mr Yeltsin has instead proposed that a constituent assembly be set up next month to approve a new constitution giving the president sweeping powers.</p>

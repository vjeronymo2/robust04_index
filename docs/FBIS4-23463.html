			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 6 Jun (AFP) -- Two former senators, including  the former president of the Senate, which was dissolved by the  Army, were today charged with "conspiracy and treason," an  offense punishable by life imprisonment. The former senators  have fallen victim to the determination of the Nigerian military  regime, which has stepped up arrests to crush the opposition.    Former Senate President Ameh Ebute and former Senator  Polycarp Nwite were charged today by the Federal High Court of  Lagos. The presiding judge, Babatunde Belgore, refused bail  with surety when requested by defense lawyers. He ordered them  to be kept in detention until 22 June, when their trial will  begin.    It also was learned today that, apart from the arrests that  have already been reported -- four former senators and a former  civilian governor -- Nigerian security forces are actively  looking for other former national politicians. All political  organizations and institutions were officially dissolved when  General Sani Abacha took over power last November. Former  Senator Bola Tinubu told AFP by telephone that the police came  to his house several times and left a message for him to report  to police headquarters as soon as possible. Since this call  from his hiding place, all efforts to contact Bola Tinubu have  been futile, and observers believe that it is quite probable  that he has also been arrested.    According to information received from several sources by  AFP, four members of the opposition -- Anthony Enahoro (former  minister of information under General Gowon's administration -  1966-1975), Michael Ajasin, Bola Ige, and John Oyegun, all three  former civilian governors -- have been visited by police within  the past 24 hours. Their fate was still not known this evening.  Mr. A.A. Oriola, one of the defense lawyers for Messrs. Ebute  and Nwite, told AFP that the main charge against the two accused  was "conspiring to cause the overthrow of the head of state,  Gen. Sani Abacha, from power."    On 1 June, the senators, in a communique signed by their  president, declared the military government "illegal," and  called for the formation of a government of national unity, led  by Mashood Abiola. The two senators are the first to appear  before a court since the beginning of the spate of arrests made  by the Nigerian security forces within the ranks of the  opposition.    Far from being intimidated by these arrests, the opposition,  under the banner of the National Democratic Coalition, plans to  go to Moshood Abiola's residence in Lagos and ask him to form  his government, a member of the dissolved House of  Representatives, who asked not to be named, told AFP today.    The Muslim billionaire, who is said to have won the 12 June  1993 presidential elections, canceled by the Army, stated  recently that he would form his government of national unity as  soon as an assembly representing, according to him, the  aspirations of the sovereign people, asks him to do so.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On his arrival at Madrid's Barajas Airport today  from China, Juan Manuel Eguiagaray, minister of industry and  energy, said it was very important that the presence of Spanish  industrial interests should be increasingly obvious in a market  of 1 billion people, as in the People's Republic of China.  Eguigaray described his visit to a country with 13 percent  economic growth and that offers major targets for Spanish  industry as "lengthy and fruitful." The minister also said that  the visit sought to boost and consolidate relations with China  following the establishment of economic cooperation and a  sizeable credit channel during the 1993 visit to that country by  Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez.</p>

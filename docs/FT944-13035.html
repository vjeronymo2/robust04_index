			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Fuel for thought: The challenge of cutting costs in UK coalmines The four miners munching their sandwiches 900 metres down Clipstone colliery in Nottinghamshire seemed oblivious to their frontline role in Britain's coal revolution. Until April 1993, they were working in one of Europe's deepest coalmines for British Coal, the state-owned corporation. Since January, they have been sweating in the same dark tunnels for RJB Mining - the mining company that is the government's preferred candidate to take over most of the rest of British Coal's deep mines in England. RJB has bid Pounds 900m for the pits, at least 50 per cent more than the next highest bidder. The gap has raised questions about RJB's assessment of the coal market and the company's ability to cut operating costs. Many analysts assume that, if RJB can make a profit from the coal where British Coal failed, it will be because of the greater productivity it squeezes from miners. At Clipstone, RJB has managed to double output per man-shift, according to Chris Daniels, colliery manager, through a combination of manpower savings and greater use of multi-skilling underground. But the men at the coalface, such as Martin Mulligan - who spent six months on the dole between British Coal closing the pit and RJB reopening it - have noticed little difference. 'We've got exactly the same team here, doing exactly what we were doing in the old days, and we get paid almost the same too,' he says. The differences between what happens now and what happened in the old days become evident further from the coal face. Daniels says there have been big job cuts on the surface. 'There is now one man looking after the baths, the lamp room, the methane pump house and the boiler room, where we used to have five,' he says. There are now six people in management grades, where there used to be 35. With the zeal of the convert, he also insists that the RJB style of management is making a big difference. 'British Coal was a very hierarchical and slow-moving organisation with detailed custom and practice built up over 50 years. By comparison RJB is incredibly open and flexible,' he says. The emphasis on the team means there is no place for union collective bargaining at Clipstone or at the other mines RJB will take over. But both Daniels and his boss, Richard Budge, insist that unions are still recognised for everything short of pay bargaining. On pay, Budge says he wants to keep the existing British Coal rates in most areas, but he is not keen on the expensive incentive bonuses many miners receive. At Clipstone, pay is not an issue. It is a small pit with only one face open and 250 men producing about 500,000 tonnes a year - compared with 700 producing about 1m tonnes under British Coal. Sid Walker, the local official of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers who helped to recruit most of the employees, says there has been no deterioration in safety standards or in pay. He adds that he has not had to deal with no any grievance problems. Nine hundred metres underground Tony McPhee, a mechanic, says that absenteeism has declined and the spirit is good. But the government gets no thanks from men like him for handing over the industry to RJB. 'We've now got the opportunity to show the government that they made a big mistake in writing off our industry. If RJB can do it then good for them. I'm a socialist and I've got no qualms about working for (Richard Budge),' he says. This is music to Budge's ears. But Clipstone and the other two pits he currently operates under licence are very different from the 15 deep mines that RJB is negotiating to buy from the government. Many or all of these are much larger: at Daw Mill and Welbeck in the Midlands, for example, the combined weekly output is 20 times Clipstone's. Pay packets are also bigger, thanks in part to the incentive scheme, which lifts some miners' wages to Pounds 1,000 a week. Another difference is that most of the men at Clipstone were hand-picked to start work for a new company. They had been made redundant by British Coal and, with payments of Pounds 30,000-plus in the bank, were less worried about small changes to their pay arrangements. At the 15 mines now under discussion, RJB will have to take over the existing workforce under the rules of the European Union's Acquired Rights Directive - known as Tupe in Britain. This means that British Coal's terms and conditions, including pension rights, have to be taken over by RJB, unless it can persuade miners to sign new contracts. It also means that, if RJB wants to make redundancies among managers or surface workers, it will have to pay the current British Coal rate of up to Pounds 27,000. Without the co-operation of miners at these pits, the scope to cut operating costs could be restricted. And with RJB hoping to get rid of incentive bonuses, that co-operation may be hard to win. Mr Neal Greatrex, leader of the UDM, says: 'Budge thinks that he has got all the aces up his sleeve, but he hasn't. We both want to save as much of the industry as possible. But I don't want it to be at the expense of our wages.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] While some are of the opinion that the ROK should  obtain recognition for exceptional treatment of inter-Korean  trade prior to its submission of the final implementation plan  for Uruguay Round, the government has decided that it need not  take the initiative of bringing up the matter within the scope  of the Uruguay Round system, it was learned on 3 February.    A relevant government official on that day said, "The  provisions of the constitution and the North-South Agreement  define the inter-Korean transactions as transactions within the  nation, which is an expression of the right to  self-determination. Therefore, we need not separately obtain an  official recognition for an exceptional treatment of the  inter-Korean transactions in the Uruguay Round Treaty.    The government official added, "If we apply for the  recognition for an exceptional treatment, it could be an action  tantamount to admitting that the inter-Korean transactions are  in violation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. If  a third country demands that we pay a price for such  transactions, we may fall into a position of having to do so."</p>

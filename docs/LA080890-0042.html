			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTDOOR NOTES;  </P> <P> HUNT FOR DEER MIGHT BECOME SECONDARY  </P> <P> The general deer hunting season opens in the state's largest zone Saturday, and  experts advise hunters to do what the deer have to do: Look for water.  </P> <P> Zone A, encompassing 26 counties, extends along the California coast from Santa  Monica to within about 125 miles of the Oregon border and inland along  California 99, an area suffering from a four-year drought.  </P> <P> "There is some water left in scattered locations, (but) good water sources are  few and hard to find," said Larry Sitton, wildlife management supervisor in  Long Beach.  </P> <P> Hunters who have scouted for water sources are expected to have the best  chance. Last year, 6,847 of 53,924 hunters -- 15% -- were successful in taking  a legal buck (forked horn or better) in Zone A. The season ends Sept. 23.  Archery season ran from July 14 to last Sunday.  </P> <P> Sitton suggested that the better areas would be Ojai ranger district of the Los  Padres National Forest, the Nordhoff Peak area east of California 33 and south  of Sespe Creek, the southern tip of Los Padres National Forest, and the Potrero  Seco area.  </P> <P> Hunters were alerted to extreme fire danger and were advised that some areas  could be closed because of dry conditions.  </P> <P> Bob Hinckley of Fullerton was fishing in the right company when he caught a  record-size 333.4-pound Pacific halibut near Gustavus, Alaska, last week. His  wife, Jean, holds the 12-pound-test line class record for albacore with a  57-pound 12-ounce catch off Pt. Loma in 1982, and his fishing pal, James McAdam  Jr., has the all-tackle world record for giant sea bass -- 563 pounds 8 ounces,  at Anacapa Island in 1968.  </P> <P> Hinckley's halibut would have been a line-class record, except for a couple of  technicalities. Instead of gaffing the fish, the crew first harpooned it twice,  then had to shoot it to subdue it. A large halibut can destroy a small boat.  </P> <P> The fish was eight feet long, a foot thick and three feet wide. Another boat  had to be summoned to assist in getting the fish aboard.  </P> <P> The controversial Columbia River-Pacific Ocean SHARK Tournament last weekend  failed to fulfill concerns of opponents who feared it would attract a dangerous  number of sharks to the area.  </P> <P> Twenty-four entrants caught four sharks, the largest 56 pounds.  </P> <P> The drought isn't all bad. Bob Tanner, who operates the Red's Meadow Pack  Station out of Mammoth Lakes, said the lower water levels will provide an  unusual opportunity for good back-country fly fishing next month.  </P> <P> "With the low water, there is less food floating in," Tanner said. "What it  means is you're getting October fishing in (August and) September."  </P> <P> And the onset of winter makes the high Eastern Sierra difficult to fish in  October.  </P> <P> For non-anglers, the scenery alone can be worth the trip.  </P> <P> "We're in awfully good shape," Tanner said. "We had some good rains in July and  may get some more this week. The horse food in the mountains is excellent. The  grass is green."  </P> <P> With most outfitters, a customer has the option of riding in with his pack mule  or hiking and letting the mule carry the load. Tanner noted a change over the  years.  </P> <P> "The age group that used the trails in the '60s went to work and didn't have  time for backpacking anymore," he said. "Now we see them coming back with their  kids."  </P> <P> Briefly  </P> <P> A new federal ruling establishes stiff penalties for dumping trash overboard  and requires all commercial and recreational boats 26 feet or longer to display  a placard stating that such dumping is illegal. The ruling, which went into  effect July 31, provides for civil penalties of as much as $25,000 and criminal  penalties of as much as $50,000 and five years in jail. Placards are available  by calling (800) 237-8663. . . . Toll-free whitewater rafting information is  available by phoning the California Western River Guides Assn. at (800)  552-3625.  </P> <P> The Fish and Game Commission has scheduled a meeting in Sacramento Thursday to  consider certifying environmental documents for dove and bandtailed pigeon  hunts. Adoption of the hunts was postponed last week because of the threat of a  legal challenge. . . . The commission authorized doubling ptarmigan permits to  100 in Alpine and Mono counties, where the state's first hunt was conducted  last year. . . . DFG wildlife biologist Denyse Racine will lead a free tour to  observe tule elk Aug. 18, starting at 8 a.m. at the wildlife viewpoint six  miles south of Big Pine on California 395.  </P></p>

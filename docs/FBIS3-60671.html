In an interview with independent English Newspaper, THE  TELEGRAPH published in its Monday's issue captioned "Pak option  for N-plan due to Indian threat."[sentence as published] The  Foreign Minister said, "We believe in principle that the nuclear  buildup is bad for the people. We have the capacity to do so but  we have given assurances that we will not do so and we are  simply keeping option for nuclear buildup open for security  reasons."    The question of nuclear non-proliferation and the security  of  the states concerned must be addressed from regional point of  view while India must re-think about its role in this region, Mr  Ali said.    Replaying to a question about the US perception of nuclear  proliferation by Pakistan, he said it would be difficult for  Pakistan to sign nuclear non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) under  the given situation when India was doing everything for  proliferation.    The Foreign Minister said that Pressler's proposal for  conditionalising the signing of NPT with aid had pushed Pakistan  to a stake while India was still acquiring nuclear technology  and introducing new weapons like nuclear carriers and  submarines. "They are the naughty boys and nuclear  delinquents", he added.    Asked about the present stand of the Pakistan Prime Minister  not to roll back the nuclear plan in the wake of pressure from  the West, Mr Ali said, "There were also suggestions from friends  of Pakistan that it should not dismantle its nuclear programme."    When asked if (India) is not in a position to go to war what  is the necessity on the part of Pakistan to maintain nuclear  plant, the Foreign Minister said, "this is just because we can't  let our defence programme shelved. We had been victim of  aggression before and just for that matter we can't play with  our own security."    The Pakistan foreign Minister referred to the Indian plea of  developing nuclear weapons to counter China and said in the  present context China is not at all threat to India or any other  country.    Asked if Pakistan was in a position to counter India which  has more than half a million soldiers Mr Ali said there was no  provocation from Pakistan side rather India was mobilising  soldiers to contain its internal insurgency which was going on  in different parts of India.    He said India has got lot of problems and added even a  massive troops mobilisation in Kashmir failed to restrain the  Kashmiri people. "Just by using force you can't contain them."    Asked Pakistan would go for any defence pact with Bangladesh  particularly when the 25-year treaty between Bangladesh and  India expires by 1996. [sentence as published] He said. "Let  time come. We have the highest sympathetic sentiments for the  people of Bangladesh and what Bangladesh expects from us will be  given due attention. "We have cooperation at all levels, he  said.</p>

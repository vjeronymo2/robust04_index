			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilian tin giant poses export conundrum - A look at questions raised by Paranapanema's recently-announced production cut The drastic production cuts announced recently by Brazil's Paranapanema, the world's largest tin company, is not expected not lead to an equivalent reduction in its exports this year because of purchases of tin ore from wildcat miners. Despite Paranapanema's denials, market analysts expect the company to increase these purchases, particularly if international tin prices continue to recover. Paranapanema announced on February 3 that it would cut its production of tin concentrate by 45 to 50 per cent - from 12,955 tonnes last year to between 6,500 and 7,000 this year - in an attempt to reduce world tin stocks, conserve its own reserves and push up prices. The company made two cuts of 10 per cent each last year in response to falling international tin prices. It said the cut would contribute to bringing down world tin stocks from 41,000 tonnes at the end of last year to 22,000 by the end of this year. The production cut, which Paranapanema says represents about 3.5 per cent of estimated world tin demand this year, will be concentrated at the company's Pitinga mine in the Amazon, which has traditionally accounted for more than 90 per cent of the company's production and half of Brazil's. Ms Adriana Franca, an analyst at the Brazilian subsidiary of London-based broker WI Carr, says: 'Paranapanema wants to maintain its reserves at its Pitinga mine until prices are higher and increase its purchases of tin ore from wildcat miners'. Mr Arislando Prado, Paranapanema market relations director, said in a written statement that the decision had nothing to do with the unexpected resignation of company president Dr Samuel Hanan at the end of last year. Dr Hanan is still working with Paranapanema as a consultant and resigned as president for personal reasons, according to the company. In addition to Pitinga, Paranapanema owns half of the Ebesa joint venture, which buys ore from wildcat miners at the Bom Futuro site in Rondonia state. Last year Paranapanema's share of Ebesa production was about 4,000 tonnes. Ms Franca says she has been told by Paranapanema that its purchases from Bom Futuro via Ebesa will increase by 1,000 tonnes and she calculates that the company's exports will therefore be reduced by about 30 per cent. The local media has also reported Paranapanema's intention to increase purchases from wildcat miners. However, the company is now denying that any increase is planned. Mr Heinz Feldenheimer, a Sao Paulo-based tin trader, says he expects higher prices to attract more wildcat miners to Bom Futuro and that Paranapanema will increase its purchases substantially: 'For Paranapanema it makes sense because they don't have to invest or risk anything, they just buy from the independent miners'. Mr Feldenheimer also expects the recovering world tin price to spur Brazilian companies to export more this year than last, even though its quota, agreed with the Association of Tin Producing Countries last October, is lower. Although Brazil is not a member of the organisation it has agreed to an export quota of 20,175 tonnes this year, compared with 24,000 last year. Because of the closed nature of Paranapanema and its dominance of the Brazilian tin sector, accurate production and export statistics are difficult to obtain. The Brazilian Tin Producers Association, whose president is a Paranapanema official, refuses to comment on the company's cuts and the association says that it cannot yet release figures for Brazil's tin concentrate exports last year. However, preliminary data from the association puts last year's production at 21,000 tonnes, of which 15,000 tonnes was exported - far below the 24,000 tonne quota. This raises questions about Paranapanema's stated production of 17,000 tonnes last year, which includes Ebesa production. According to Ms Franca, 98 per cent of the company's production is for export and that would mean that Paranapanema and its share of Ebesa exceeded Brazil's total tin exports. Mr Feldenheimer speculates that the company could have retained stocks last year because of the low prices, which hit Dollars 4,600 per tonne in September. Since then the London Metal Exchange three months delivery tin price has recovered to over Dollars 5,600 a tonne, partly because of the ATPC agreement, and producers are hoping that it will reach Dollars 6,500 by the end of the year. Other tin companies are not expected to increase production to compensate for Paranapanema's cut, according to Mr Luiz Carlos Bacil, executive director of Corumbatai Metais. He says his company is operating at half its 600-tonnes-a-month capacity.</p>

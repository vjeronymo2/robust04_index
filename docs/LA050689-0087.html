			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRANIAN URGES PALESTINIANS TO KILL AMERICANS  </P> <P> Hashemi Rafsanjani, Speaker of the Iranian Parliament, Friday called on  Palestinians to kill Americans and other Westerners to avenge their dead in the  17-month uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> The call provoked an immediate reaction from Washington, where the  Administration issued a worldwide alert to American diplomatic and military  installations, warning of a possible renewal of terrorist attacks on U.S.  targets.  </P> <P> In an inflammatory declaration, Rafsanjani said that "the people of Palestine .  . . must avenge the blood (of the reported 461 Palestinian deaths in the  occupied territories)."  </P> <P> </P> <P> British and French, Also  </P> <P> "If in retaliation for every Palestinian martyred in Palestine they kill and  execute, not inside Palestine, five Americans or Britons or Frenchmen, (the  Israelis) would not continue these wrongs."  </P> <P> Rafsanjani's remarks were quoted by the official Iranian news agency in a  report monitored in Nicosia. The news agency said that the Speaker, a strong  candidate for the presidency in elections scheduled for August, delivered his  "strong advice" in Friday prayers in Tehran.  </P> <P> In Washington, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater issued the  strongest Administration comment on Iran since President Bush took office.  </P> <P> "We find it appalling and strongly condemn, in no uncertain terms, Rafsanjani's  call for Palestinians to murder our citizens, citizens of allied countries and  other innocent people," Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> "It is an exhortation for Palestinians to commit terrorism and only serves to  confirm that terrorism remains an integral feature of Ayatollah (Ruhollah)  Khomeini's regime. The outrageous call to murder and terrorism by Iran's  Speaker of the Parliament marks another step backwards for Iran away from the  community of civilized nations. We hold the Iranian leadership responsible for  any attacks on American interests or citizens.  </P> <P> "What we see here is the same kind of incredible and outrageous comments that  we saw in the (novelist) Salman Rushdie affair," Fitzwater added. "Both are  totally beyond the bounds of human understanding."  </P> <P> One counterterrorism official in Washington described the Iranian's remarks as  "outrageous," adding: "That's the kind of language, particularly out of  Rafsanjani, that could lead to some disastrous consequences. This guy could get  a lot of people killed."  </P> <P> Rafsanjani's demand for vengeance came on a day of massive rallies in the  Iranian capital, marking Jerusalem Day, a holiday dedicated to the Palestinian  cause.  </P> <P> "Those who give $10 billion a year to preserve Israel and know what they are  doing, is their blood worth anything?" Rafsanjani asked his audience. "It is  not hard to kill Americans and Frenchmen. It is a bit difficult (to kill)  Israelis, but there are so many (Americans and Frenchmen) everywhere in the  world."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Urges Terrorism  </P> <P> The news agency said that the Iranian official also "called on Palestinians to  hijack planes to swap prisoners in Israeli hands and to blow up factories in  Western countries."  </P> <P> Rafsanjani, a Muslim cleric as well as a politician and commander of the  Iranian army, was not concerned, the monitored report said, about "Western  accusations of encouraging violence, and neither should be the Palestinians."  </P> <P> Until Friday, the Bush Administration had generally taken a comparatively  moderate line on Iran, beginning with the President's reference to better  relations with Tehran in his inaugural address. Moreover, there has been a  four-month hiatus in suspected Mideast terrorism attacks on American targets  since the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland.  </P> <P> But the Administration now warns of a possible renewal of violence, with  concern centered mainly on American interests in the Middle East and Europe.  </P> <P> Rafsanjani's remarks conformed to a pattern emerging in the tempestuous  politics of Iran. Anti-Western rhetoric began there in February, when Khomeini,  the Muslim country's supreme leader, demanded the execution of author Rushdie,  whose novel "The Satanic Verses" he condemned as blasphemous. Britain, where  Rushdie lives, broke relations with Tehran, and 13 other countries, mainly  European, withdrew their ambassadors at least temporarily from the Iranian  capital. The United States has no diplomatic relations with Tehran.  </P> <P> Khomeini's remarks were interpreted in part as a signal to Iranian officials to  take an anti-Western stance. Several top leaders in Tehran, including  Rafsanjani, had supported stronger trade and diplomatic contacts with the West  in the wake of Iran's agreement to a cease-fire last August in its long and  bitter war with Iraq.  </P> <P> The 88-year-old ayatollah subsequently declared that his earlier personal  choice as successor, the Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, was unfit for  leadership. Like Rafsanjani, Montazeri had supported stronger ties with the  West to rebuild Iran's war-shattered economy. He had also criticized the brutal  justice meted out by Khomeini's regime.  </P> <P> U.S. officials were both alarmed and perplexed Friday by Rafsanjani's comments  because he is widely considered to be one of the most pragmatic Iranian  leaders.  </P> <P> "It was a strange thing to do right now," one State Department official said.  "We frankly are not sure what to make of it. . . . It is particularly worrisome  from Rafsanjani. . . . You have to ask why he is doing it. It may be wrapped up  in the (Iranian) presidential election. . . . He's very adept at reading the  political tea leaves. He will go in whatever political direction he feels is  necessary to strengthen his position. . . . But it is really disturbing that he  would do something like this."  </P> <P> An intelligence official in Washington said: "It is Jerusalem Day (in Iran) and  rhetoric is always high on those occasions. But coming from Rafsanjani, this  may be more than just rhetoric. He may be trying to cover himself by getting  out in front of the parade on this issue. And it does come in context of the  general anti-Western atmosphere after the Rushdie affair."  </P> <P> In recent weeks, Rafsanjani has been taking a harder line in his comments on  the West, and his political star has apparently risen again. Two weeks ago, he  used the occasion of Friday prayers in Tehran to announce the arrest of a  number of top-ranking military officers in what he called a "big American spy  ring" operating in Iran. In Washington, presidential press secretary Fitzwater  denied any knowledge of such a ring and suggested that Rafsanjani's accusations  were politically motivated.  </P> <P> Thursday night, Iran Television began a series called "Top Secret," in which  some of the accused spies are expected to make on-the-air confessions of their  alleged crimes.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Robin Wright and James Gerstenzang, in Washington,  contributed to this story.  </P></p>

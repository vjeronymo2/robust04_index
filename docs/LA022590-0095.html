			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORCED UNITY IS A FORM OF TYRANNY;  </P> <P> SOUTH AFRICA: BLACK MAJORITY RULE MEANS THE SURRENDER OF POWER -- POLITICAL  SUICIDE FOR THE WHITE MAN. IT IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.  </P> <P> South Africa is at the crossroads. Either we deny the reality of various racial  and ethnic groups, or peoples, for the sake of a non-existing non-racial  society, or we recognize the facts of our population's composition and take  notice of the rise of various nationalisms here, in Eastern Europe and  elsewhere.  </P> <P> The reforms advocated by the government of President Frederik W. de Klerk are a  departure from the principle of self-determination. What it offers as  power-sharing is really a surrender of power and control. The government's new  (lack of) philosophy envisages a country in which separateness is abolished and  all peoples and racial groups take part in executive and legislative functions.  The government pretends to adhere to democratic principles, and promises to  prevent the domination of one group by another, but it fails to say how power  is to be shared between 5 million whites and 25 million blacks, or how  domination of the latter over whites could be avoided in a democratic  dispensation where numbers necessarily will decide.  </P> <P> The ethnic awakening and demand for political self-determination in Eastern  Europe has been political practice in South Africa for the past four decades  but is now being betrayed. We were well ahead of the perception of Rutgers  University Prof. Albert Blaustein when he said: "Group rights is  legal-constitutional terminology for the new ethnicity of which the world has  become increasingly conscious. . . . Studying the legal-constitutional response  to the new nationalism -- the manifestation of the new ethnicity -- is  essential in understanding the evolution of modern human rights. For there is  an inherent conflict between individual human rights and the rights demanded  by, for and on the basis of special groups."  </P> <P> The ruling party in South Africa is still paying lip service to the concept of  a so-called plural society, but its "totally new South Africa" disregards the  principle of self-determination for the different peoples -- their right to  determine their own forms of government.  </P> <P> The new emphasis is on negotiation and consensus. The Conservative Party  maintains that our people's claim to land and our right to govern ourselves are  not negotiable. We reject the idea of consensus government because it means  dictatorship, which is not acceptable anywhere, except perhaps in Third World  countries. In the long run, the majority decides in any democratic  dispensation.  </P> <P> That is why a one-man, one-vote system in a unitary South Africa, with its  disparate communities or national groups, will not guarantee democratic rule,  but domination of smaller nations by the numbers of the numerically stronger  ones or combination of black nations. South Africa has a deeply divided  population -- along racial, ethnic, cultural, language and religious lines. The  differences are more significant than those between, for instance, the English  and the French, or the Flemish and the Walloons in Belgium. To force together  such largely disparate peoples, cultures and races, will amount to a form of  tyranny, the very opposite of democratic freedom.  </P> <P> Before the political somersault of the current government, remarkable progress  had been made toward the development of separate freedoms for the various  peoples, ethnic groups, in their own territories, or homelands. That is the  partition policy consistently advocated by the Conservative Party. Seven black  peoples -- in Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Transkei, Ciskei, Bophuthatswana  and Venda -- accepted political independence in their own territories. Six  others -- Kwazulu, Qua-qua, Lebowa, Gazankulu, Kwa-Ndebels and Kangwane --  accepted self-government, the final stage before independence, also in their  own territories. They endorse a policy of separate freedom, or partition. We  say that such development is not turning back the clock, but confirms that we  are in step with modern developments elsewhere in the world.  </P> <P> Although white people in South Africa were formerly inclined to decide how  blacks would manage their affairs and develop their communities, whites now  concentrate on protection of their own freedom, political structures, economic  development, land and security. We argue: If minority peoples such as the  Swazi, Sotho, Tswana, Xhosa, Venda, are entitled to their own lands and forms  of government, then that principle should equally apply to the Afrikaner people  -- Afrikaans and English speakers of South Africa, white South Africans.  </P> <P> This claim is contrary to the demands for black-majority rule over the whole  country made by the African National Congress and Nelson Mandela, the South  African Communist Party and other radical leftist organizations. And if these  demands are not met, they say they will resort to "armed struggle."  </P> <P> The release of Mandela and unbanning of the ANC and Communist Party have not  brought peace. The unrest, violence, arson and threats of armed rebellion  continue. And these people have been invited to take part in negotiations for a  new constitution that also includes whites. They have demanded acceptance of  the principle of majority rule even before the talks start. Majority rule and  internal peace are two sides of the same coin, says Mandela.  </P> <P> That means the surrender of power, political suicide for the white man in this  country. That, of course, is totally unacceptable to any people with  self-respect and a long history of freedom and resistance against threats of  domination.  </P> <P> Therefore, the two choices are: black majority rule over the entire country,  including whites, or separate freedoms for various peoples under their own  governments in their own territories. The latter is the only moral solution.  </P></p>

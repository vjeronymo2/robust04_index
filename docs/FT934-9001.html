			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Royal's cycle ride The higher insurance premiums foisted on British homeowners and motorists are bearing fruit. Royal made a third quarter underwriting profit in the UK, despite more pain from mortgage indemnity policies written in the 1980s. Without this legacy of mortgage-related business - and another wave of claims against employers for industrial injury - UK insurance would have produced a handsome profit. Yet it is doubtful whether such auspicious circumstances can be maintained for long. The composite insurance sector has not made aggregate underwriting profits in consecutive years since the early 1970s. Royal has pledged to maintain insurance rates even if that means surrendering market share. Not all of its peers will take such a disciplined attitude. With Direct Line starting to make inroads into household as well as motor insurance, competitive pressures could quickly force prices down. Higher profits next year look assured, for Royal as for other composite insurers, since premium increases take up to 18 months to flow to the bottom line. Royal should also benefit from reduced mortgage indemnity losses and improved results in reinsurance. But earnings of perhaps Pounds 300m-Pounds 400m in 1995 will not look an especially generous return on shareholders' funds - now Pounds 2bn - if the industry subsequently lurches into another cyclical downturn. Low interest rates are a reason for optimism that the underwriting cycle will be less severe this time around. In contrast to the 1980s, premiums paid by customers can no longer be parked in short-dated gilts to earn double-digit interest rates. That makes underwriting profits more important. Still, it takes a giant leap of faith to believe that a 20-year legacy of bad habits will be easily extinguished.</p>

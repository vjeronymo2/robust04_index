			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vittorio Malagutti: "That Airport Is Cosa </F> Nostra"]    [Text] The Mafia and banks. A bridge between Sicily and  the Antilles. A 50-billion-lire loan on a phantom contract in  the Caribbean. Thus, Montepaschi [the Monte dei Paschi di Siena  banking group] lent a helping hand to a dubious enterprise. With  no guaranty and...    He was an untouchable. A businessman feared and respected by  everyone, beginning with politicians, bankers, and magistrates,  on both sides of the Atlantic, in Italy, in the Antilles, in  Venezuela, and in the United States. Over a period of more than  20 years, Rosario Spadaro, a Sicilian from Messina, Saro to his  friends, had built himself a fortune: casinos, hotels, tourist  centers, a small air fleet. All of this at Saint Martin, a small  Dutch West Indies island where he had settled in 1979.    A few weeks ago, the 60-year-old Spadaro reached his  high-flying journey's end. A police boat patrol boarded his  yacht off the Antilles and the Messina-born entrepreneur ended  up in handcuffs. The Dutch magistrature has opened an inquiry on  Spadaro and his activities. But the Italian magistrates also  have many questions for him. Last September, in Messina, a pool  of investigators conducting an inquiry into an international  arms traffic operation served him with due notice of  investigation. The charges: Criminal association and corruption.  Spadaro has long been suspected of ties with the Mafia. The  Sicilian businessman who had settled in the Antilles was well  acquainted with Nino Salvo, Cosa Nostra's collector, who was  killed in an ambush in September 1992. Spadaro also had ties  with Gaetano Corallo and Ilario Legnaro, Catania boss Nitto  Santapaola's lieutenants, who, on several occasions, like Salvo,  had visited Saint Martin, a tourist paradise that has always  been deemed a perfect island for laundering dirty money. Thus,  Spadaro, who has always proclaimed himself to be simply an  "honest and rich Sicilian," ended up in the sights of the  Italian magistrates.  <H5>  Mafia of the Casinos </H5>   In 1985, Spadaro was questioned by Milanese Magistrate Paolo  Arbasino, who was conducting an inquiry on the mafia of the  casinos. Meanwhile, Giovanni Falcone was investigating ties  between Messina-born entrepreneur Spadaro and Catania-born  builder Gaetano Graci. But Spadaro's recent arrest brings  another event into the spotlight. A story as complicated as it  is mysterious, that, four years ago, triggered the investigation  of the Antimafia High Commission. The Commission was headed at  that time by Domenico Sica. It all started with a $40 million  (over 60 billion lire) public-works contract for the expansion  of Saint Martin's airport, a deal in which Spadaro and his  friend Vincenzo Bertucci, a consultant of Calabrian origin,  based in Rome, were actively involved. There was talk of  kickbacks and mafia ties.    Several wiretaps revealed that Spadaro associated with  Claudio Ciampi, an official of the BNL [National Bank of Labor]  in New York and son of Italy's present prime minister, who at  that time was the governor of the Bank of Italy. The inquiry  ended up buried under proclamations of innocence by those under  suspicion, and polemics regarding the wiretaps ordered by Sica.  In the wake of the Tangentopoli [Bribe City] cyclone, however,  that episode has now resurfaced. In addition to Spadaro,  Bertucci has also had trouble with the law. His name has now  joined the other names in the caldron of those under  investigation in connection with the SACE [Export Credit  Insurance Agency] scandal.    But there is more. The documents that IL MONDO has been able  to examine show that the contract for the Saint Martin airport  was financed by the ICLE [National Credit Institute for Italian  Works Abroad], which is controlled by the Monte dei Paschi di  Siena banking group. To the ICLE, operations like the Saint  Martin one were not new. From the investigation of the SACE  being conducted by the Rome magistrature, the fact emerges that  the Monte dei Paschi group's ICLE, which merged last year with  Mediocredito Toscano, played a central role in the financing of  many works projects for small Caribbean republics. For example,  ICLE had strong ties with Spartaco Ghini, the recently bankrupt  Perugia-based builder accused of fraudulent bankruptcy. Ghini  was very active in the Caribbean where his enterprises operated  for years building hotels and tourist centers, always covered by  SACE policies. Among other things, Ghini too had chosen Bertucci  as his trusted consultant for these operations. In Saint Martin,  however, Bertucci had applied his efforts to favoring Spadaro's  friends. But, for ICLE, the airport operation proved a disaster.  Actually, work under the project, initially awarded to the  Messina-based C&amp;D Construction Company, never even got  started.  In 1990, a year after the signing of the contract, Saint  Martin's governor revoked the work order. Result: The first  tranche of the financing disbursed by ICLE, in the amount of  $13.5 million or almost 20 billion lire, became an uncollectible  debt.    Meanwhile, ICLE had paid $175,000 (over 250 million lire) to  a Panamanian company, Spantax Holding. The identity of the real  beneficiaries of this sum, paid out as a brokerage commission,  remains a mystery. In order to reconstruct the succession of  events it is necessary to take a step backward in time, and  specifically, to the summer of 1989, when a Saint Martin  government delegation landed in Catania. It was met by Bertucci,  by Spadaro's son, and by representatives of builder Graci. The  same delegation also visited ICLE in Rome. On that occasion, the  final details of the agreement were ironed out.    The ICLE, which had joined the orbit of the Monte dei Paschi  group a short time before, undertook to finance the airport  construction project in the amount of $35 million. The operation  was shepherded for ICLE, whose general manager was then Cesare  Brogi, by Raffaele Gambardella, one of its high officials and  member of the Christian Democratic Party (for as long as the  party existed). Destined for a successful career, he is  currently the general manager of SIMEST, the state financial  intermediary for support of joint ventures abroad. Bertucci,  with his Exen, a Rome-based service company, acted as the  middleman. Bertucci being, as he was, in a position to vaunt his  first-rate relations with the top officials of ICLE as well as  those of SACE and of the Foreign Trade Ministry, his presence in  the deal was by no means a casual one.    The contract signed, the project was initially awarded to a  small Messina enterprise, the C&amp;D Construction Company, with  a  capital of only 60 million lire. The company was run by an  engineer from Messina, Roberto Caligiore, but, according to  wiretaps conducted four years ago by Sica's investigators, half  the company's capital was in the name of Spadaro's wife. After a  few weeks, C&amp;D formed an ad hoc consortium, the Juliana  Airport  Consortium. For this purpose, C&amp;D allied itself with AICO,  another small construction company, headed by a certain Ugo  Tortella. Caligiore and Tortella, together with Manlio Bertucci,  brother of Vincenzo, were members of the board of directors of  the consortium, 15 percent of which was controlled by AICO. This  share was later increased to 25 percent.    On paper, work was to have started during the first months  of 1990. ICLE did its part, disbursing the first tranche of the  loan, $13.5 million. The disbursement was cashed directly by the  Italian consortium as a down payment on the project. But on the  other side of the ocean there had been a change of mind. Via a  letter dated 15 November 1990, the Princess Juliana  International Airport, the client public-sector company in the  deal, notified the ICLE that it had no intention of honoring the  contract initialed the year before. The Antilles airport  company's board of directors had changed since then and the new  board members, according to their statements, had discovered  numerous irregularities in the agreement with the ICLE. Cited  among these was the fact that Bertucci's Exen had furnished  erroneous data on the volume of the work involved. "In the  course of the investigation," the 15 November letter states,  "the board of directors has further found that ICLE has made  payments totaling $13.5 million to the Juliana Airport  Consortium. Let it be understood that in the future the airport  cannot assume any responsibility with respect to these  payments." This amounted to saying that the Antilles government  had no intention of paying for the work order, which it deemed  irregular.    In a subsequent letter, dated 6 December 1990, Saint  Martin's  representative stated that ICLE had authorized the loan without  seeking any information on the financial solidity of the  borrower company. A peculiar proceeding, to say the least. ICLE,  through its attorneys, formally challenged all the accusations,  but to no avail. The contract was broken and the work order  revoked. The Princess Juliana Airport Consortium remained de  facto a phantom company. A phantom that had walked away with  $13.5 million. Without having done anything.</p>

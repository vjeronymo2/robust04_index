			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Mexico to authorise launch of another six local banks THE MEXICAN government is set to authorise six new banks for business in the near future, a senior finance ministry official said in London yesterday. Mr Guillermo Ortiz, finance under-secretary, said the government had received six applications to open banking institutions and expected to authorise all soon. The authorisation, despite opposition from owners of some of the 18 existing banks privatised for a total Dollars 12.6bn in the past two years, reflects government determination to extend competition in the financial sector. It hopes this will bring down the huge spreads between deposit rates, now around 17 per cent, and lending rates, often around 35 per cent for medium-sized companies. Four applicants have been widely reported in the Mexican press. Mr Carlos Slim Helu, owner of Inbursa, a brokerage, and president of Grupo Carso, which controls Telefonos de Mexico, is to start a bank with national coverage that would complement Inbursa. Similarly, Mr Carlos Hank Rhon - who runs the Interacciones brokerage, the Seguros La Republica insurance company and a wide variety of other businesses - is also seeking to open a national bank. Mr Eduardo Creel, from the financial group Bursamex, wants to open a regional bank with headquarters in Merida. Mr Jose Gaspar Espinosa, a leading businessman from the state of Sinaloa, is hoping to open a regional bank in Culiacan, the state capital. The government will compel the new banks to satisfy a minimum capital requirement of some Dollars 32.3m, to reveal their principal shareholders and directors, and to disclose their intended locations, number of branches, and the businesses on which they will focus. The newly authorised banks will all be Mexican-owned.</p>

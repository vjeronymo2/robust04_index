			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article under the rubric "Provinces": "Scandal </F> in Nizhniy Novgorod"]    [Text] In one of the largest regions--Nizhniy  Novgorod--free expression of citizens' will seems to have been  overshadowed by a scandal. Those involved in it are not ordinary  candidates: They are D. Bednyakov, acting mayor of Nizhniy  Novgorod; Ye. Krestyaninov, a senator and former oblast soviet  chairman; and indirectly--Governor B. Nemtsov.    The scandal began to flare up when D. Bednyakov  and Ye. Krestyaninov both decided to run for city  mayor. The governor supported the latter. Apparently for this  reason the rivals accused them both of corruption and  connections with the mafia. Apparently not wishing to  participate in a slugfest, Ye. Krestyaninov removed himself from  the mayoral race, and the elections did not take place  altogether.    D. Bednyakov, however, also was running for the oblast Duma.  Elections in his Electoral District No. 3 were declared invalid,  however, since fewer than 25 percent of valid ballots had been  cast. Later, in clear violation of procedure, a recount was  conducted and... found a sufficient number of votes. The initial  data were destroyed. The procuracy began an investigation. This  actually was the high point of the scandal.    It was preceded by another, however--abuses that occurred  during the privatization of GAZ [Gorkiy Auto Works], the largest  Russian automotive giant. The plant leadership was accused of  illegally buying up vouchers for subsequent privatization.  Governor B. Nemtsov, among others, brought up the subject of the  illegality of such operations.    Whether by accident or not, after this incident allegations  of corruption began to fly with respect to both the governor and  his confederates. At the same time, the GAZ leadership openly  supports acting Mayor D. Bednyakov. So far, however, the  fight for influence in the oblast has been contained in the  boundaries of election-related scandals.</p>

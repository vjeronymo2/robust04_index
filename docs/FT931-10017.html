			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Taking on fewer risks to enjoy a healthier future Five years ago anyone suggesting that Commercial Union might become the strongest and most profitable UK insurance company would have provoked wry smiles in the City. In the mid-1980s CU was one of the first UK insurance companies ever to report losses and for much of the 1980s was regarded as the 'sick man' of the UK insurance sector. Yet after yesterday's Pounds 428m rights issue Commercial Union has emerged as the strongest and best capitalised of the UK's large insurance companies. Capital and reserves of Pounds 1.9bn exceed those of its rivals, including the erstwhile leader Sun Alliance. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 31.4m for 1992 should comfortably exceed its rivals. 'It is a remarkable turnaround in seven or eight years,' says Mr Steven Bird, analyst with Smith New Court, the securities house. Mr Tony Wyand, executive director, who orchestrated yesterday's rights issue, said: 'We've managed to rehabilitate the company in the eyes of its shareholders.' CU's success reflects the difficulties of its rivals, whose management has been ill-prepared to face one of the deepest downturns in the history of the UK insurance industry. Claims from mortgage indemnity policies will exceed Pounds 2bn, hindering the ability of those companies most affected to take advantage of the current upturn in insurance rates. But equally the company's recent success is also a result of a more cautious management style, which has taken root as the company moved to tackle the disastrous results of a period of aggressive expansion in the US in the early 1980s. Mr Tony Brend - along with three other executives, Mr Wyand, Mr John Carter and Mr Peter Ward - based their recovery strategy on reducing exposure to higher risk and more volatile lines of business such as commercial insurance. 'We always started at the liability end of the balance sheet. We aimed to limit risk and reduce the volatility of the business,' said Mr Wyand. Instead CU has focused on building less risky life assurance business, especially in mainland Europe where many businesses have been started from scratch. Life premiums now account for 36 per cent of premium income compared with 17 per cent 10 years ago. CU has also reduced its exposure in the US, which now accounts for only 27 per cent of its premiums compared with 50 per cent in 1982. Mr Wyand, who worked his way up through CU becoming an executive director in 1985, took advantage of 'time and distance policies' - financial reinsurance policies similar to banking deals - to extend the timescale of heavy US liabilities from asbestosis and pollution-related claims. In the UK the group scaled back its motor insurance book, when many rivals were cutting their rates to win market share. In 1986 Mr Peter Ward, who directs UK business, opted to cut exposure to mortgage indemnity business on the grounds that returns were inadequate. In contrast three companies - Royal Insurance, Sun Alliance and Eagle Star - were blase about the risks of domestic mortgage indemnity and have been crippled by losses stemming from the crisis in the housing market. By 1990 when the heavy European storms in January heralded heavy losses across the industry, CU was better prepared to face the downturn. Its 1991 losses of Pounds 69m were a fraction of those sustained by its rivals. Last year while many of its rivals shrank their business, premium income at CU grew by about Pounds 1bn, increasing (without taking into account exchange-rate movements) from Pounds 4.11bn to Pounds 5.57bn. Expansion has been rapid in life business - premiums rose from Pounds 384.1m to Pounds 705.8m in the UK in 1992 - especially in the market for single premium with-profit bonds. New life insurance operations have been launched in Italy (where CU has a joint venture with a local bank, Credito Italiano), France, Spain, and more recently in Poland and Turkey, where the company sees excellent prospects for long-term growth. But the group has also taken advantage of the hardening in market conditions in UK general business, where premium rates rose strongly last year. Mr Wyand estimates CU increased its share of the UK motor insurance market by 2 per cent last year, with premium income rising from Pounds 145m to Pounds 213.7m. This rapid increase in business - especially in the last quarter of 1992 when income from home and motor insurance rose more than 50 per cent - has strained the company's capital base. Growth accelerated in the fourth quarter, making fresh capital a necessity. 'The speculation would have been so strong. Market speculation about the need for fresh capital would have disturbed the share price,' said Mr Wyand. 'We have added the equivalent of a medium-sized insurance company to the group in only 12 months. That kind of expansion is not something you can expect any company to finance from its own resources,' he added. The withdrawal of some smaller companies from the market - Municipal Mutual, the ninth biggest company, was one of a number that withdrew from many lines  -means bigger companies are now better able to push through rate increases. Heavily burdened by their mortgage indemnity exposure, CU's main competitors are less well positioned to take advantage of the upturn in rates. 'We are now fully capitalised to take advantage of a once-in-a-generation opportunity in the UK market,' says Mr Wyand.</p>

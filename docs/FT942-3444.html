			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Economic Watch: Inflation on the rise in Greece Greece's annual inflation rate rose to 11 per cent in May from 10.4 per cent the previous month, according to official figures released yesterday. Monthly consumer prices went up by 0.8 per cent in May. As in April, the increase resulted from a new tax on heating fuel and higher food prices. Increases in household rents and clothing prices also contributed. The government's target of bringing the inflation rate down to 9.5 per cent by the end of the year now looks difficult to achieve. Although a devaluation was averted following last month's lifting of capital controls, the drachma is expected to depreciate against other EU currencies. Analysts said higher prices for imported goods over the next few months as a consequence of the drachma's recent depreciation, together with increased transport and utility prices, could add another one or two percentage points to the year-end rate. Kerin Hope, Athens Spain's consumer price index rose 0.2 per cent in May, keeping the annual inflation rate unchanged from April at 4.9 per cent, according to the economy ministry. The number of registered unemployed dropped for the third month running, by 57,000 to 2.68m or 17.4 per cent. David White, Madrid Portugal's consumer price index, excluding rents, rose 0.2 per cent in May, compared with an increase of 0.6 per cent in April, the national statistics institute said yesterday. Average annual inflation was 6 per cent, unchanged from April, but down from 8.2 per cent in May 1993. Year-on-year inflation fell from 6 per cent in April to 5.7 per cent in May. Peter Wise, Portugal The Nederlandsche Bank, the Dutch central bank, lowered its key money market intervention rate yesterday to 4.9 per cent from 5 per cent, as it offered Dutch banks five-day funding under the so-called special advance facility.</p>

			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE '80S A SPECIAL REPORT;  </P> <P> THE TASTE MAKERS;  </P> <P> PRESENTING THE BIG PLAYERS AND MAJOR IDEAS THAT -- FOR BETTER OR WORSE --  SHAPED THE 1980S. THIS IS CALENDAR'S FIFTH ANNUAL TASTE MAKERS REPORT, EXPANDED  THIS TIME TO COVER THE LAST 10 YEARS IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: SHOW BUSINESS  EXECS, FILM PRODUCERS, FILM DIRECTORS AND WRITERS, STAGE, TV, MUSIC, DANCE, POP  MUSIC, JAZZ, COMEDY, RADIO, ART AND RESTAURANTS.;  </P> <P> POP MUSIC;  </P> <P> BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN  </P> <P> Perhaps the crystallizing moment of Bruce Springsteen's incredible success came  during the 1984 presidential campaign, when "Born in the U.S.A." fever was at  its almost Beatlemania-like peak, when concert tickets were like gold ducats  for bankers and auto workers alike -- when no less a luminary than the  President himself chose to quote the lyrics of this humble symbol of the  working class from Joisey. A moment to make Mama Springsteen proud, perhaps,  but a moment to tick off millions of fans who knew that the Commander in Chief  had it all wrong, terribly wrong; that the outwardly celebratory, inwardly grim  "U.S.A." album was a product of -- but hardly a patriotic tract for -- the  Reagan Era.  </P> <P> The President wasn't the only one to just not get it, nor was he the only one  to attempt to co-opt the amazing Populism that Springsteen represents. Pop acts  from pathetic mimic John Cafferty on up to fellow do-gooder John Cougar  Mellencamp would scarcely exist in their present form if not for Brooooce. The  neo-folk movement in rock, too, might not be with us if not for the impact of  the all-acoustic "Nebraska" album, which, unlike "Born in the U.S.A.," made no  attempt to sweeten its downbeat Americana themes and Woody Guthrie-like  broadsides.  </P> <P> Springsteen first became a star in the '70s, but only in the '80s did he become  something that everyone needed a piece of, from the GOP to the tabloids.  </P> <P> The Taste Makers project was edited by David Fox, assistant Sunday Calendar  editor.  </P></p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: Managers and workers protest at Posco chief's resignation MR PARK Tae-joon, chairman of South Korea's Pohang Iron and Steel Company (Posco), appeared determined yesterday to quit the world's third-largest steelmaker despite symbolic protests among the company's managers and workers. Mr Park's resignation, which took the company by surprise on Monday, came a week before Posco shares are to be offered to foreign investors for the first time. His departure comes amid signs of conflict between Mr Park and other leaders of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP). In an attempt to persuade Mr Park to reconsider his decision, the company's 48 directors threatened to resign, 141 department managers signed an appeal for him to stay on, and more than 3,000 Posco workers demonstrated at the company's steel complexes in Pohang and Kwangyang. Mr Park left Seoul, where he was attending a DLP meeting of the as the party's co-chairman, to travel to Pohang to explain his decision to the company's labour force. The protests reflect fears over Posco's future after Mr Park leaves, as well as his revered status within the company he created 25 years ago on the Korean government's orders. Mr Park provided extensive social welfare benefits to his workers, which made him popular. Analysts said Mr Park's resignation would probably not immediately effect Posco's prospects since it has one of the best managements in South Korea. But they expressed concern about the long-term implications. 'Posco is known for its exceptionally loyal and cohesive management, which is largely due to Mr Park's personal dedication to the company. The danger is that esprit de corps could disappear along with Mr Park, especially if the government eventually appoints an outsider to run the company,' said one Korean securities analyst. Posco, which is 35 per cent owned by the Korean government, has benefited from Mr Park's close ties with the political leadership. Mr Park said he timed his resignation to coincide with the completion of final phase of the expansion of Posco's production facilities. However, Mr Park may have fallen victim to the growing dissension within the DLP as the presidential election approaches in December. Mr Park has indicated he is opposed to the DLP presidential candidate, Mr Kim Young-sam. Mr Park made an abortive bid for the DLP presidential nomination earlier this year. There is speculation that Mr Park may leave the DLP to support another presidential candidate or stand himself. Possible successors to Mr Park include Mr Hwang Kyung-ro, vice-chairman; Mr Jung Myung-sik, president; and Mr Park Tuk-pyo, vice-president for strategic planning.</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MATURE TRAVELER: SNOWMOBILES TOURS EASY EXERCISE  </P> <P> Mature travelers who wish to participate in a sport other than skiing are being  introduced to the Winter Sports Center of Lake Tahoe.  </P> <P> Owners Ari and Tina MacKinen have developed easy-to-handle snowmobile tours for  the mature individual, as well as cross-country skiing trips that are not too  strenuous.  </P> <P> Working with snowmobile manufacturers, sports and medical professionals,  outdoor clothing manufacturers and safety experts, the MacKinens have brought  snowmobiling from harsh rides and lots of noise to a smooth, muted trail  adventure.  </P> <P> They offer a two-hour guided snowmobile tour in scenic Hope Valley, just west  of Lake Tahoe, for $65 per person.  </P> <P> There are a few king and queen seats for double riders at $90 per couple. The  cost includes shuttle-bus pickup and return from all Stateline, Nev., casino  hotels.  </P> <P> Novice snowmobilers might want to add $5 for an extra-warm snowsuit, $3 for  snow boots and $3 for goggles. The safety helmet is included in the price.  </P> <P> "Though the snowmobiles are capable of going much faster, our guided tours run  at about 15 m.p.h. to 25 m.p.h. for mature riders," Tina MacKinen said.  </P> <P> The tour route is graded and smoothed each morning to ensure a comfortable  ride.  </P> <P> For those who would rather try something shorter or who would want to test the  snowmobile first, a 30-minute ride on the Winter Sports Center snowmobile track  is $22 for one, $40 for a double-seater.  </P> <P> The MacKinens also schedule night snowmobile rides for an additional $10 per  person.  </P> <P> The Winter Sports Center, on U.S. 50 at Tahoe Paradise by the Lake Tahoe  Country Club, also offers cross-country skiing on a variety of novice-to-expert  trails and on state recreation and park lands. Cross-country trails also are  groomed daily.  </P> <P> A daily pass is $5 per person, while a daily ski package -- including  cross-country skis, boots and poles plus the area pass -- is $10.  </P> <P> Newcomers to cross-country skiing often choose the 90-minute group lesson for  another $9 (or $20 per person for the lesson, all equipment and a day pass).  </P> <P> Complimentary shuttle-bus service also is included.  </P> <P> The Winter Sports Center has special group rates for 15 or more mature  travelers wishing to go snowmobiling or cross-country skiing.  </P> <P> For group tours the center can arrange for a Snow Cat to meet the tour group's  snowmobiles along the route for a mountaintop lunch. They also can provide Snow  Cat rides for those who don't wish to try snowmobiling.  </P> <P> For more information: Lake Tahoe Winter Sports, P.O.

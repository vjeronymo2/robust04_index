			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Mushtaq Ahmed] </F>   [Text] Marijuana cultivation has increased alarmingly in  the three districts of Chittagong Hill Tracts [CHT's] and the  hilly areas of Cox's Bazar District. It is estimated that  annual production in these areas is more than 500 metric tons.  Almost all tribal families living in the inaccessible hilly  areas of the three districts of Rangamati, Khagrachhari, and  Bandarban in CHT's have become involved in marijuana  cultivation. Different sources say that the large-scale  cultivation is in accordance with a conspiracy to convert the  CHT's into a "second Golden Triangle." It also has been learned  that the process of producing superior quality drugs from  marijuana has already started in the area. People entrusted  with the responsibility of preventing the production of  marijuana and destroying the crops are remaining silent, even  after realizing the seriousness of the matter. More area in the  hilly regions therefore are being turned to cultivation of this  dangerous plant.    Different sources say that about 80 percent of the marijuana  produced in these areas is smuggled to Saudi Arabia, Greece, the  United States, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Bangkok. The drug  traffickers use Greek ships anchored in deep water. A large  mafia group is engaged in the entire process, from cultivation  to smuggling. Many people believe that some Department of  Narcotics and Liquor officials are directly involved in this  issue. Marijuana crops stretch over an eight-mile area on both  sides of the Barmmachhari canal 15 miles east of Fatikchhari  police station. This marijuana garden extends from the new  Barmmachhari market to the old one. In Khagrachhari District,  marijuana covers a three-mile area. The leaves of these plants  are very developed. Marijuana is also being cultivated in large  areas on the western and eastern side of Ranirhat and Bethbunia  in the deep jungles of Rangamati District. Large areas of land  patroled by the Mahalchhari police station in Rangamati District  are also under cultivation. In Bandarban District, there are  large tracts under cultivation on both sides of a canal located  about eight miles east of the district headquarters. In Cox's  Bazar District, marijuana is being cultivated inside the hills  at a place about seven miles from the Ukhiya police station.    At the beginning, people from Barisal District who have  settled in these areas began marijuana cultivation in  collaboration with a mafia group. They thought that this was a  profitable business. Later, the Rohingya refugees who came to  Bangladesh also became involved. Marijuana is being cultivated  in 16 kanis [about eight acres] located on the eastern side of  the Maricha market patroled by the Ukhiya police station. It is  also being cultivated on a large-scale basis in an area covering  more than eight to nine miles in the deep forests east of the  Ramu police station. In this area, it is mainly the people from  Barisal District and the Rohingya refugees who are engaged in  its cultivation.    Apart from these areas, marijuana is being cultivated in  large tracts in the three districts of CHT's and Cox's Bazar.  Cultivation began in these areas in 1985 when the government  imposed a ban on marijuana production and use. An organized  international mafia group is encouraging the poor people living  in the hilly areas to cultivate marijuana by paying them in  advance. They have started large-scale cultivation of the plant  as they make a lot of profit from it. It has been learned that  the mafia group buys the leaves of the marijuana plant at a very  nominal price from these production centers. The dried leaves  are loaded into trucks and brought to Chittagong city, with the  bags of marijuana leaves hidden under vegetables. This  marijuana is stored in underground warehouses in various parts  of Chittagong city, including Patenga. Later, it is carried by  small boats to ships berthed at the outer anchorage of  Chittagong Port.    Marijuana is being purchased from the cultivators at the  rate  of 1,000 taka [about $25] per kg, but is loaded into ships at a  cost of about $300 per kg. Though cultivation has increased  alarmingly during the past few years, officials of the  department concerned have not taken any action in this regard.  It is reported that six tons of marijuana were seized once from  Barmmachhari area. It is surprising that the informer who  traced the location of these marijuana fields at the risk of his  life and reported it to the concerned authorities has not been  rewarded. It has been learned that he has gone into hiding, but  the personnel of the Department of Narcotics and Liquor have not  apprised the senior authorities of the matter. A question has  arisen as to whether the government has been informed about this  large-scale cultivation of marijuana. If it has been informed  about it, then why is it not taking steps to destroy these  marijuana gardens? The trusted people of the government high  command should make an aerial survey of the areas under  cultivation to verify the allegations. Informed quarters feel  that if the government fails to take timely action, then it will  become difficult to foil the conspiracy which has been hatched  to convert these areas into the second Golden Triangle.</p>

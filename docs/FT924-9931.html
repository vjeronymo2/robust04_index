			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Arts: Best by Miles/Abdullah Ibrahim - Jazz Miles Davis is now a trademark owned by the estate of Miles Davis. Since the trumpet player's death a year ago the tributes have poured forth. This one, touring for the last five months, faithfully revisits one of his most synergic small groups. The 1963 quintet of Herbie Hancock (piano), Ron Carter (bass), Tony Williams (drums) and Wayne Shorter (saxes) combined the liberated talents of young men heading for freer ground with an older leader distilling the essence of ballads and standards. Even then Davis said he knew they were on to something different: 'Tony was the fire, the creative spark; Wayne was the idea person, the conceptualiser . . . and Ron and Herbie were the anchors. I was just the leader who put us all together.' Last week at the Royal Albert Hall, with Dave Holland standing in for Ron Carter, they brought it all back - from buoyant takes of 'Footprints' and 'So What?' via the poignant melancholy of 'Kind of Blue' to a dismembered version of 'Straight, No Chaser'. The old sound came together around Tony Williams' focus of thick rhythm and Hancock's anchoring chords, Shorter stepping up to exchange flurries with young Wallace Roney, Davis's shadow. The re-united quintet of the 1970s employed Freddie Hubbard to handle Davis's parts. Curiously though, the band is less about Roney or Davis than the interaction of the others in this famous setting. Showers of silvery chords from Hancock were tied to the rolling thunder of Williams' complex time work. Britisher Dave Holland swung easily into Carter's shoes, resonant solos emerging from strict accompaniment. Some song and soul temporarily dispersed the economic gloom of Canary Wharf over the weekend in the shape of the sixth Docklands Jazz Festival. The Cabot Hall's stage with a shiny expanse of illuminated office glass for a backdrop, is a curious setting for the rural tones of South African pianist Abdullah Ibrahim. But Ibrahim somehow fitted. Buttoned up head to toe in black, he walked across the cityscape to the grand carrying an attache case in one hand and a burning joss stick in the other. In the first of two extended pieces, Ibrahim set a wistful and sombre tone with a lyric which invoked images of Namibia and later summoned the memory of John Coltrane. But the half spoken words detracted from the message of otherwise evocative projection and put me in mind of a more worldly Peter Skellern. It didn't last though and Ibrahim was soon painting a bigger canvas. African tinged melodies rolled out of moody bass lines and were dismantled for more Western ideas and a final return to the Namibia refrain. As his joss stick burnt low, melancholy voices gave way to a more optimistic sound and a stirring hymnal close.

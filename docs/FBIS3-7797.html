			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dusan Mitevic, "close associate" of </F> President Slobodan Milosevic," by Albena Shkodrova, "especially  for STANDART NEWS"; place and date not given: "If the Serbs  Down U.S. Aircraft in Self-Defense, No One Will Be Able To Stop  the War"]    [Text] People close to government circles in Belgrade say  it is easier to get into Milosevic's office than to meet with  Dusan Mitevic. The other thing that people say about this  almost mythical figure is that if Mitevic had not existed,  neither Milosevic nor Milan Panic would have appeared in Serbian  politics. Mitevic is a close associate of Milosevic, and it is  no secret that he will become prime minister if the Serbian  president manages to win a majority in parliament.    Mitevic was a member of the Communist Party leadership in  the  former Yugoslavia as far back as in Tito's time and for many  years, he was in charge of the state radio and television. "He  had at least 5,000 people under him," people close to Mitevic  claim.    At the moment, Mitevic is one of the leading economic  figures  in Belgrade. He is in charge of MP Holdings, which is actually  "Milan Panic Holdings" -- a company registered in Los Angeles  and owned by the former Yugoslav prime minister. In his spare  time, Mitevic is the shadow ruler of the FRY. Albena Shkodrova  interviewed him specially for STANDART NEWS.    [Shkodrova] Do you think NATO will fulfill its threat of  launching air strikes against the Serbian positions in Bosnia?    [Mitevic] I believe that reason will prevail at the last  moment. However, it is clear that the threat is perfectly  serious.    I believe that all nations are good, but I do not believe in  the abstract humanity of society. I am sure that the NATO  countries are psychologically prepared to bomb us. Since they  permitted bombardments in Somalia, Iraq, and other parts of the  world, what will stop them allowing it here as well?    When I said that reason will prevail, I had in mind only  that  in the final analysis someone will calculate what the world will  gain and what it will lose by undertaking this drastic military  and political action. Only this logic will save the Serbs from  bombardment. In this connection, I think it is of absolutely no  importance whether they position this here or remove that from  there.    Regarding the bombing issue, two big questions arise:    If NATO bombs the Serbs, it will be clear that the United  Nations is no longer what it was, that the organization no  longer acts as a world parliament, given that a military  alliance (which NATO is) can calmly reject the view of the  United Nations and walk over them.    In addition, it raises questions about international  political order in general, about the laws governing the conduct  of states and governments. I think that world public opinion  should think carefully about what a precedent this creates for  violating international order.    [Shkodrova] What is Russia's role in this?    [Mitevic] As a result of Gorbachev's policies, Russia is the  United States' most important partner. If Washington disregards  Russia, the forces in Russia that want it to conduct an  independent policy will win the upper hand and put a question  mark over the future of the Yeltsin administration.    As partners of the Russians, the Americans should carefully  consider what they will gain and what they will lose from this  operation. I can swear to you that they will gain nothing  except negative consequences.    Bosnia is not Somalia. It is no desert. Here only the  civilians will suffer, while nothing will happen to the  military. The greatest danger is that in defending themselves,  the Serbs may shoot down U.S. aircraft. Then no one will be  able to stop the war -- the United States will have a reason to  seek vengeance, and Russia will have to intervene as well.    If world public opinion is really interested in ending this  war, why does it not simply apply pressure to the Muslims to  make them sign the treaty proposed by the peace mediators.  Under this treaty, the Muslims will get much more territory  than they are entitled to, based on the size of their population.    [Shkodrova] What position do you expect Bulgaria to adopt in  this situation?    [Mitevic] The position of nonintervention by the Balkan  countries in the conflict that President Zhelev has been  defending for a long time is in my view a very good one.  Everyone should refrain from using weapons, because when two  people are fighting, one should see who they are and separate  them instead of everyone joining in the fight so that it is not  clear who is hitting whom.    I hope the Bulgarians will realize this, because what is at  issue is a historical conflict on a world scale. What is  happening in Yugoslavia is merely a training exercise. It is  part of the attempt to break up Russia. It is clear to the  Western world that the Russian giant is dozing at the moment.  Accordingly, they are trying to destroy him, to prevent him  from ever rising to his feet again.    [Shkodrova] Do you consider that some EU countries are more  guilty than others?    [Mitevic] Of course. In my opinion, everything that is  happening in the former Yugoslavia is a result of Germany  beginning to implement its policy in the Balkans. As far as  they are concerned, the existence of our federation was always a  barrier for them.    The present war is really a religious one. According to the  Germans' plans, then want to separate off the Catholics -- the  Croats and Slovenes, while Bosnia is supposed to become Muslim.  This is a war against the Orthodox Christians.    [Shkodrova] When the war finally ends, do you think the  Serbs will still face any charges of being the aggressor?    [Mitevic] So far the Serbs have been continuously condemned,  including being blamed for things that have not been proved.  For example, regarding the latest incident in Sarajevo not only  is there no proof against the Serbs, but also there are many  more signs pointing to the Muslims. Despite this, the Serbs  were accused.    As far as guilt is concerned, the world is still arguing  about who was responsible for World War I.    Everyone has made mistakes in this war. This is also true  of the Western democratic states, which recognized Slovenia and  Croatia -- and Bosnia as well -- much too early. This is  precisely what provoked the conflict. The West interceded on  the side of the Muslims, with whose policies neither the Serbs  nor the Croats could agree. The strategy followed by [former  German Foreign Minister] Genscher caused the conflict.    Long after the war has ended, the Serbs will have to prove  what actually happened and it will take them many long years to  remove the stain from their. Personally, I believe that in the  end the truth will be understood. The question is how much it  will cost.    [Shkodrova] Do you think any change may be expected in  Serbia's foreign policy?    [Mitevic] No, the primary problem is to stop the war. After  this, we will then think about paying more attention to our  neighbors and to the security of the region. The Balkan nations  will emerge from this war somewhat sobered up. The humanitarian  aid that came to us through Bulgaria and Romania has drawn us  closer to these countries. I think that our relations with them  will become an important component of our foreign policy,  because the events of last year have taught us something. If  you recall, there was a play called "Australia Is Far Away"; our  neighbors are most important for us.    I think that after the end of the war, the [former] Yugoslav  peoples will once again draw closer together, and later all the  Balkan countries will do the same thing. If we are together,  this provides us with a great deal of power -- access to three  seas and -- why not? -- a unified system of telecommunications,  transportation, and so on.... Geographically speaking, our  countries are destined to live side by side.    [Shkodrova] Do you think that Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] will no longer pose a problem in  the Balkans?    [Mitevic] It is difficult to say because I am unable to  foresee how the dispute between Greece and Macedonia will end.    However, Yugoslavia has an interest in this country  [Macedonia] remaining as it is. What its name is does not  bother us.    In actual fact, the dispute between Macedonia and Greece  boils down to a linguistic dispute, and the pride and obstinacy  of the two peoples have added fuel to the flames. I consider  that both Serbia and Bulgaria should help Macedonia to develop  in peace. The Macedonians have nothing to be afraid of. It was  to some extent a hysterical reaction on Skopje's part to bring  U.S. troops to Macedonia.    It seems to me that the problem of the Albanians is more  important for the republic [of Macedonia], just as it is for us  in Kosovo.    [Shkodrova] How likely is it that you will become prime  minister of the FRY?    [Mitevic] To tell you honestly, I would not particularly  want this to happen. I was a state servant for many years, but  for the past two years, I have been in private business and have  no desire at all to change my situation. A person who has had  his tongue burned once always blows on his soup afterwards.</p>

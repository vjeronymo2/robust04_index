			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: KPMG sued over Medway valuation Two former directors of Medway Ports are suing accountants KPMG Peat Marwick for alleged negligence in a share valuation, which they claim deprived them of a multi-million pound windfall. The suit was launched by former operations director Mr Des Crampton and ex-legal director Mr Keith Middleton, who were made redundant along with hundreds of employees earlier this year. They are disputing the 250p valuation by KPMG in March, just months before the company agreed to a takeover bid by Mersey Docks at Pounds 37.25 a share. Employees who were made redundant were required to surrender their shares, some to directors of the company, at Pounds 2.50. Mr Crampton and Mr Middleton claim to have lost more than Pounds 4m by the KPMG valuation. The company's four directors received shares and cash worth Pounds 20m in the takeover. A valuation by accountants Ernst &amp; Young found the shares would have been worth more than Pounds 2.50. KPMG has claimed the value was depressed, in part by uncertainty over staffing levels. Mr Crampton said he expected other former shareholders to take similar action.</p>

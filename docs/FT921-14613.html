			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Equity Issues: US issuers expected to extend business domination US COMPANIES have dominated the new international equity business so far this year and are expected to continue tapping the capital markets during the first quarter of 1992. According to one estimate, between 100 and 125 US deals, including initial public offerings and domestic issues, are expected by the end of February. The largest deal announced so far is the Dollars 1.25bn equity issue for Chemical Banking, the bank resulting from the merger of Manufacturers Hanover Trust and Chemical Bank. The funds are intended to strengthen the bank's capital position. Goldman Sachs is the lead-manager, with Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley acting as co-leads. Chemical Banking has registered to issue up to 50m shares, of which 5m will be offered internationally. International Paper, the US forest products group which has expanded aggressively in Europe in recent years, plans to reduce its gearing by raising about Dollars 560m. The company is issuing 8m new shares, 1.5m of which will be offered to international investors. Credit Suisse First Boston is the lead manager, with Goldman Sachs as co-lead. USX-Marathon Group, the US group which includes the operations of Marathon Oil, is hoping to raise Dollars 440m for a capital expenditure programme. Lehman Brothers is the lead manager for the issue which consists of 20m shares, including a 4m international tranche. USX-Marathon and USX-US Steel resulted from a stock split by USX, the Pittsburgh-based steel and natural resources group, last year. Hospital Corporation of America, a hospital management group, has announced an initial public offering of 34m shares to raise Dollars 700m. Of these, 6.8m shares will be offered internationally. The company was taken private in a management-led buy-out in 1989 but is now seeking a New York listing. The proceeds will be used to pay outstanding debt and the management will keep a 66 per cent stake in the company. Goldman Sachs is the lead manager for the issue.</p>

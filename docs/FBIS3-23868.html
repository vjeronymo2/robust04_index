Yeltsin dissolved the deputy corps of  Russia on 21 September, parliament's death-agony did not  continue for very long--two weeks.    At the same time, some of the deputies voluntarily gave up  their deputy positions, while others are holding on to their  badges to this day. As is the custom in our country, after any  kind of turmoil there is a lengthy analysis of "who helped carry  the wood" for the president, and who, for Khasbulatov. This  time, thank God, it is not in order to execute by firing squad,  but only simply to deny deputy privileges and social guarantees.  Aleksey Surkov, an ex-deputy, was entrusted to head the  commission established for this purpose under the president's  administration.    Edict No. 1435 of 23 September guaranteed all deputies a  continuation of housing, job placement, an early pension, a  large severance pay, and medical and health resort support. But  part of the deputies ignored this edict, as well as Edict No.  1400, out of political considerations. Many from that  irreconcilable opposition were the first to run to the cash  department directly from the burning White House. This was N.  Malkov, I. Muravyev, N. Ogorodnikov, T. Ponamareva, I. Rybkin,  A. Sokolov, and others. It will be recalled--they received  approximately 2 million rubles [R] each.    Such hypocrisy on the part of people who incited a bloody  tragedy, which almost became the starting point of a civil war,  did not go unnoticed. By Edict No. 1590 of 6 October, social  guarantees for the former people's deputies who remained in the  White House to the end were canceled.    Of course, we had to look into the rather delicate question.  We are not the investigators, and we generally wanted to find  out through questionnaires until what date a deputy was in the  White House, whether he took part in mass disorders, and whether  he instigated them.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Did the president make short work of  political opponents through your commission?    [Surkov] No, that is not the way people are dealt with.  Today, many deputies are very surprised, seeing many  "troublemakers" in "high" positions. According to Edict No.  1590, it was necessary to leave the White House before 3  October. But for several days before this, the very same people  were approving decrees of congress right up to the execution of  those who supported the president.    We examined 530 personalities, carefully studied verbatim  reports, and we also had a Ministry of Internal Affairs list of  those who were led out of the White House on 4 October.    As a result, 151 former people's deputies of the Russian  Federation were identified to whom Edict No. 1435 does not  apply. In accordance with complaints and statements, 13 former  deputies on this list were authorized to receive severance pay.  <H5>  `BLACKLIST' </H5>   V. Agafonov, A. Androv, Ye. Alayev, I.

Thus, I think that everyone should know this list of  antiheroes who, hiding behind walls, wanted to involve the whole  population of the country in a bloody slaughter.    I want to note that those who are on the list, but who have  already received money, will be obliged to return it. This, in  my opinion, is one of the reasons that many of them began to  shout about reconciliation and general political amnesty. The  trial of Khasbulatov and Rutskoy is disadvantageous to them. The  chain will also stretch to the State Duma to those who urged the  leaders on to a bloody confrontation. The very same method is  being used to frustrate the criminal cases--through a deputy  commission.    FROM THE EDITORIAL STAFF. In publishing the  "blacklist," we are refraining from making our own comments.  Some will assess it as a political sentence for the extremists,  and some will perceive them to be heroes. But everyone must make  this choice for himself.</p>

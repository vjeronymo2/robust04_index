			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 SOUGHT IN STRING OF HOLDUPS, KILLING  </P> <P> Police and sheriff's deputies were still searching Thursday for a pair of armed  robbers who allegedly shot and killed one man and wounded a store owner during  a violent, three-store robbery spree in the San Gabriel Valley Tuesday night.  </P> <P> The robbers, masked and clad in black, stole a sports car at gunpoint at a West  Covina shopping mall before holding up two "mom and pop" stores in Rosemead and  El Monte and a Duarte pizza franchise over a two-hour period, authorities said.  The pair later eluded deputies after a high-speed chase early Wednesday  morning.  </P> <P> Detectives said the frequency and close proximity of the hold-ups made them  unusual.  </P> <P> During the robbery of the Marketplace, a small general store in El Monte, Yung  Suk Yoon of Diamond Bar, the store's 31-year-old manager, was shot and killed.  Yoon, whose family owns the store, apparently struggled with the robbers, said  El Monte Police Detective Gary Walker.  </P></p>

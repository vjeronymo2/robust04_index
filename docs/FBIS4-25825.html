			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Bi Quanzhong (3968 0356 1813) and </F> XINHUA reporter Yin Hongzhu (1438 7703 4376)]    [Text] Beijing, 13 Jun (XINHUA) -- Reporters have learned  from the State Education Commission that since last year's  promulgation of the "Outline of the Reform and Development of  China's Education" and the "Teachers' Law," party and government  leaders in all localities have seized the opportune moment to  implement them earnestly, and have taken effective measures to  do practical turns for education, thereby effectively promoting  the reform and development of educational services.    Data gathered in this respect shows that various localities  have generally increased their input in education to solve the  shortage of educational funds. In addition to ensuring that  educational funds will increase along with economic growth and  increases in financial revenue, Guangdong Province has, since  last year, collected 1 percent of the annual income derived from  secondary and tertiary industries as special funds for  educational development, and raised funds in society through  various channels to support education. Last year, the  province's total input in education was 9.462 billion yuan, up  61.8 percent from the previous year, while educational expenses  rose by 38 percent from the year before. Input in education by  Beijing Municipality hit an all-time high last year, with total  input reaching 2.035 billion yuan. Input in education covered  by the municipal budget accounted for more than 20 percent of  the total budgetary expenditure for five consecutive years,  while expenses for promoting universal education rose by an  average annual rate of 14.9 percent for eight years in a row.  Besides increasing its budgeted educational funds by 20.9  percent, Jilin Province last year set up special funds for  universalizing nine-year compulsory education, for establishing  major colleges and universities, and for introducing major  disciplines, and promulgated 10 policies on raising educational  funds. Last year, Yunnan Province allocated 360 million yuan  for education, an increase of more than 150 million yuan from  1992. While ensuring increases in educational funds in two  areas, Tianjin Municipality last year established an educational  development fund and decided to set up a Tianjin University  Scientific and Technological Industrial Zone and use the returns  generated by it to supplement educational funds. Last year's  input in education by Hainan Province was the highest since the  island was designated a province, with educational expenses  increasing by 26.8 percent from 466 million yuan in 1992 to 591  million yuan. Last year, Qinghai Province also unveiled 13  measures designed to ensure steady growth in education-related  input.    Meanwhile, party and government leaders in all localities  intensified their efforts to help teachers as they worked hard  to increase teachers' pay and did practical turns for teachers.  Last year, Jilin Province decided to pay special government  allowances to 15 academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences  and one foreign academician who worked in the province, as well  as 214 tutors for doctoral candidates. Liaoning's Dalian City  invested more than 200 million yuan to build a "teachers'  apartment building," thus enabling more than 1,300 teacher  families to move into new houses. Liaoning's Xinmin City built a  new village for teachers, thereby improving the housing  conditions of 1,456 teacher families. In Zhejiang's Ningbo  City, the recently promulgated policy on "double preferential  treatment" aimed at doing practical turns for education was  well-received by teachers. According to the policy, both single  workers and working couples are entitled to 5- to 10-percent  price discounts when they buy public housing. When teachers in  rural areas build houses, the government will provide homesteads  at government-set prices, and reduce certain taxes and charges  or exempt the teachers from those taxes and charges. Over the  past two years, the city has made arrangements to change the  status of more than 2,000 private teachers to public-school  teachers, fulfilling all relevant tasks ahead of schedule.  Jiangsu Province decided that the provincial financial  department would allocate 20 million yuan annually as subsidies  for provincial colleges and universities to build houses for  faculty members during the Eighth Five-Year Plan. Last year,  40,000 square meters [sq m] of houses were built, with another  40,000 sq m to be built this year. The province also decided to  concentrate apartment houses for college and university faculty  members in Nanjing and other areas.    The Sichuan Provincial Government also proposed that the  hospital affiliated with the Chengdu Traditional Chinese  Medicine College be renamed the Sichuan Provincial Hospital for  the Prevention and Control of Teachers' Occupational Diseases,  where teachers can receive medical treatment and be hospitalized  on a priority basis and on preferential terms. Henan, Anhui,  and Hubei Provinces have all drawn up measures to ensure that  salaries will be paid in full to primary and middle-school  teachers every month. The measures specify that beginning this  year, educational funds covered by local budgets will be placed  under county management, and they will be listed separately and  budgeted in full amounts.</p>

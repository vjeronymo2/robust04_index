			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Arts: Tamburlaine the Great CHRISTOPHER Marlowe's Tamburlaine the Great contains some of the most wonderful passages of verse in English drama. No one can forget the line 'To ride in triumph through Persepolis,' nor Tamburlaine's tributes to his consort Xenocrate. Yet the play is very rarely done professionally. It went through the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries without a recorded performance. The Yale University Dramatic Association revived it in an abbreviated version in 1919, and since then it has remained a favourite with universities. The only previous performance I have seen was at Oxford. The Old Vic staged it in 1951 with Donald Wolfit as Tamburlaine under the direction of Tyrone Guthrie. Peter Hall produced it for the National Theatre in 1976, when Tamburlaine was played by Albert Finney. The new production at Stratford directed by Terry Hands is the first time that the Royal Shakespeare Company has touched it, and one begins to see why performances are so few and far between. Tamburlaine is played by Antony Sher, which is part of the problem. Sher has many qualities, including an ability to hang upside down on a rope while speaking his lines and a way of stuffing emotion into killing and dying. But he does not seem particularly interested in speaking verse. This is a serious lapse, for the quality of some of the verse is the most that can be said for Tamburlaine. Untune that string and, to quote another play, hark what discord follows. Unlike Marlowe's Doctor Faustus, the play has no real plot and very little subtlety. Tamburlaine, drawn from the historical character Timur Khan (1336-1405) simply goes on conquering till he dies. The play's attraction is the way he puts his overwhelming ambition into poetry - 'I hold the Fates bound fast in iron chains' - and equally his expression of love for Xenocrate, daughter of the Soldan of Egypt, whose land he also conquers. To be fair to Sher, it is not entirely his fault for not taking the poetry as central. Tamburlaine comes in two parts. University productions tend to concentrate on part one, where the conqueror is on the up and up and has his best lines. The RSC version, though condensed, gives parts one and two. The best scenes between Tamburlaine and Xenocrate are spread across both, and it is only in part two when she is dying that Xenocrate (played by Claire Benedict) comes into her own. Tamburlaine has a lot of fighting to do in between and after. Sher plays him as a demonic Hitler figure, possibly with a touch of Saddam Hussein. He should not be unduly criticised for that either. Only undergraduates would romanticise Tamburlaine as a man. Yet they do that for an understandable reason: he speaks romantic verse, some of it foreshadowing Keats, as in the lines beginning 'If all the pens that ever poets held'. There is one point in the production where Sher's performance is admirable. That is Tamburlaine's desire to return to Samarkand, the place from whence he came, before he dies. He fails to make it. Here Sher is in his element. I had not previously seen this as a pivotal part of the play. I also greatly admired the performance of Darlene Johnson as Zabina, the wife of Bajazeth, the emperor of Turkey whom Tamburlaine imprisons in a travelling cage. Here is one piece of dignity in a vicious world.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: AIG improves to Dollars 1.55bn in 'difficult business climate' AMERICAN International Group, one of the largest US composite insurers, yesterday reported after-tax profits of Dollars 1.55bn in 1991, against Dollars 1.44bn in the previous 12 months. In the fourth quarter alone, the company made a net profit of Dollars 399.8m, against Dollars 381.9m in the final three months of 1990. The shares gained Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 87 at close of trade. The final-quarter result includes net realised capital gains of Dollars 10.3m against Dollars 4m, and the annual figure, Dollars 60.7m against Dollars 59.5m. The company acknowledged the business climate had been difficult - pointing to 'the continued competitive pricing environment in the domestic property-casualty industry', the US and European recessions, and particular factors that hit fourth-quarter results. AIG said that catastrophe losses in the final three months totalled Dollars 47m - against zero a year earlier - while restructuring costs consumed Dollars 14.5m. It reorganised its New Hampshire Insurance Company, to concentrate on small and medium-sized commercial business, which resulted in staff reductions and branch office closures. Premiums written during the year overall fell by 1.3 per cent to Dollars 9.15bn, with a 6.6 per cent fall in the final quarter. Despite this retrenchment, AIG said its main businesses - general insurance, life and financial services - showed improved operating income.</p>

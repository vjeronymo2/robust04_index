			<p>BFN     [Text] The government announced the results of its  estimate of the effect of public investment and deregulation on  economic growth and employment. The estimate says deregulation  will push the real annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth  rate up by an average of 0.5 percent points, while 100 trillion  yen in additional public investment will push the GDP growth  rate up by 0.3 percent. However, deregulation is expected to  result in 1.2 million less jobs, particularly in the  distribution sector, and in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries.    The government's calculations considered four hypothetical  cases: 1) Deregulation is not implemented and no additional  public investment on top of the current public investment  program (430 trillion yen over 10 years); 2) an additional 100  trillion yen in investment alone is implemented; 3) only  deregulation is implemented; and 4) both additional public  investment and deregulation are implemented. It proceeded to  compute sector-by- sector production volume and demand for labor  up to the year 2000 using the interindustry relations table.    In this process, the effects of deregulation were considered  difficult to quantify. Therefore, calculations were made on the  assumption that through market liberalization and easing of the  licensing and permit systems, the price gap with the major  advanced nations is eliminated, and the productivity of primary  industries and the distribution sector is raised to a level  comparable to the European countries and United States by the  year 2000.    According to government calculations, in case 1) real GDP  growth rate will be 2.3 percent. In terms of demand and supply  in the labor market, while labor supply will be 67.79 million in  2000, according to the Management and Coordination Agency's  estimate, demand will remain at 67.3 million, rendering 490,000  workers superfluous.    In case 3) where deregulation is implemented, GDP will grow  by 2.8 percent due to the expansion of personal consumption as a  result of narrowing down the price gap between Japan and foreign  countries. At the same time, increased efficiency in the primary  industries and the distribution industry -- covering both  retailers and wholesalers -- demand for labor will be 66.1  million, 1.2 million less than in the case of non-implementation  of deregulation.    On the other hand, if additional public investment alone is  implemented, an annual economic growth rate of 2.6 percent can  be attained, and demand for labor will be 68.76 million.  However, the government's analysis says that in this case,  policies to protect industries with low productivity will  remain, and the trade surplus will not be reduced substantially.    Therefore, the government's analysis stresses that both  deregulation and public investment should be implemented to  enable stable growth at an annual rate of 3 percent. In terms  of labor demand and supply, the labor force will move from  industries which are inefficient, compared to other countries,  to industries with growth potentials. The estimate places labor  demand at 67.56 million, roughly on par with labor supply (67.79  million).</p>

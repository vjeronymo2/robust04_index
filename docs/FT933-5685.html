			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Unions clash on building workers PROPOSALS TO END an inter-union conflict in the construction industry that threatens to disrupt next week's Congress in Brighton will be put to the TUC general council today for its approval. Mr John Monks, incoming TUC general secretary, is trying to resolve the row about alleged membership poaching between the construction union UCATT and the AEEU engineering and electrical union. UCATT leaders are demanding an end to what they see as the AEEU's campaign to recruit their members in construction. They want the AEEU to dismantle its construction and building trades section, insisting that this is the price the union must pay to bring the electricians back into the TUC six years after their expulsion. During their years outside the TUC the electricians - outside TUC rules on inter-union relations - went on a membership recruitment offensive, attracting workers from TUC unions into their own ranks. Last night details of a proposed resolution of the dispute were not disclosed. AEEU leaders have argued that their union's construction section contains many workers who were not recruited by the electricians from UCATT before amalgamation.</p>

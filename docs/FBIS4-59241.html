			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [First of an unspecified number of installments of an </F> exclusive interview with Tariq 'Aziz, Iraqi deputy prime  minister, by MILLIYET correspondent Nur Batur in Baghdad; date  not given]    [Text] [Batur] The embargo's effects on Iraq are gradually  becoming more serious. Why have you not agreed to the UN  proposal for the sale of oil worth $1.6 billion?    ['Aziz] UN Security Council Resolutions 706 and 712 do not  allow Iraq to meet its basic needs because they call for the  allocation of a significant amount of the profit from the sale  of its oil for the UN personnel's expenses and for compensation  to the countries that incurred losses as a result of the war.  The two resolutions were drawn up in order to place Iraq under  UN control. The objective is to interfere in Iraq's internal  affairs. We definitely cannot agree to all that. The two  superpowers do not wish to alleviate the Iraqi people's pain.    [Batur] Would Iraq's compliance with the UN resolutions not  provide for the relaxation of the embargo to a certain degree?    ['Aziz] No, it would not. Had conditions not been imposed, a  way could have been found to move away from the embargo.  However, their objective is to create instability in Iraq.    [Batur] Turkey still fears that the Kurds may be forced to  emigrate once again if the security umbrella over them is lifted.    ['Aziz] I have been informed of that viewpoint several  times.  We are prepared to give any kind of guarantee that a new wave of  emigration will not take place. The Iraqi Administration stands  to gain nothing by resorting to military measures to resolve the  Kurdish problem. That problem cannot be resolved through  military measures. We have had incidents for the past 25 years.  A political solution is necessary. That is the guarantee we  can give.    [Batur] Karkuk is a key problem between the Kurds and  Baghdad. Do you plan to give a share of Karkuk to the Kurds when  the talks are resumed?    ['Aziz] No, we do not. Talks cannot be held on Karkuk.    [Batur] What would you do if the Hammer Force's mandate is  broadened to include Karkuk?    ['Aziz] We shall resist such a move.    [Batur] Will that be in the form of military resistance?    ['Aziz] We shall resist in every way.    [Batur] The strength of Iraq's military forces is a matter  of  concern. Baghdad made certain statements in the past, the  nature of which was to threaten Turkey.    ['Aziz] The target of those statements was the leaders who  sided with the allies at the time.    [Batur] You mean former President Turgut Ozal?    ['Aziz] I do not wish to criticize a person who has passed  away. However, that was the situation at the time. Had we  taken a negative approach to Turkey, would we have agreed to  joint projects with it? Nevertheless, the question of water  supply is an important matter. It must be resolved in  accordance with the two countries' interests.    [Batur] You have claimed that Turkey has been used by the  United States.    ['Aziz] I believe that Turkey has made a historic mistake by  joining the alliance against Iraq. Turkey is an Islamic  country. Do not forget that it is one of Iraq's neighbors.  Neighbors must respect each other's independence. Turkey has  now begun to pay the price of its move to join the alliance  against Iraq.    [Batur] What is the political cost?    ['Aziz] Was it right on Turkey's part to join an alliance  against one of its neighbors? You may not have approved of what  we had done. However, you should have said so. Why did you  join the military operations launched by the United States,  Britain, and other Western countries? The objective of the  military operations was not to force Iraq to withdraw from  Kuwait; it was to destroy Iraq. Did you stand to gain anything  from that?    [Batur] What do you expect from Turkey?    ['Aziz] We wish to maintain our favorable and mutually  beneficial relations. Turkey continues to observe the UN  embargo. That conflicts with its own interests. Turkey has  suffered significantly as a result of this. It has the right to  act and adopt decisions in accordance with its interests.    [Batur] Are you saying that Turkey can ignore the embargo by  itself?    ['Aziz] The UN Charter allows countries that suffer to act  individually to safeguard their rights. We are your friends and  neighbors. The past must not be allowed to affect our  relations. Iraq remains on its feet and it will continue to  exist. So, the Turkish Government should move to reestablish  its relations with Iraq as soon as possible.    [Batur] Claims have been put forward that Baghdad supports  the Kurdish Workers Party and its leader, Abdullah Ocalan.    ['Aziz] No, it does not.    [Batur] Abdullah Ocalan has reportedly visited Baghdad.    ['Aziz] That, too, is untrue. We do not stand to gain  anything by destabilizing Turkey. We are not involved in plots.  Plots are being made against Iraq, but we do not act in a  similar way.    [Batur] Who is making plots against Iraq?    ['Aziz] Those who directly or indirectly support the  abnormal  and false situation in northern Iraq. We are suffering from  that situation. Nevertheless, we have the experience we need,  so we do not maintain a two-faced policy.    [Batur] Does Turkey maintain a two-faced policy toward Iraq?    ['Aziz] Yes, some of the officials in Turkey do.</p>

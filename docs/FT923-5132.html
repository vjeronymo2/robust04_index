			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Chinese student held after returning CHINESE police yesterday detained a former student activist who fled the country after the suppression of the pro-democracy movement in 1989, writes Yvonne Preston in Beijing. Shen Tong, aged 24, returned to China four weeks ago, the first student protester to do so. He planned a news conference today to announce his intention to establish a Beijing branch of the Democracy for China Fund, an organisation he co-founded after fleeing to the US. Its aim is to give political and material support to those seeking to build, non-violently, a democratic China. Shen's arrest will not encourage Chinese students abroad to respond to Beijing's appeal to return or to believe its promise of no recriminations, though the appeal specifies they must withdraw from organisations opposed to the government and damaging to state security.

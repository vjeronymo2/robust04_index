			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Results of the second round of the 20 February  parliamentary elections are now being disclosed. Twenty of the  24 contested seats have been won. The opposition parties are  leading with two seats more than the Rally of the Togolese  People [RPT]. [passage omitted]    The opposition is already claiming victory. On 21 February,  Mr. Yao Agboyibor, Action Committee for Renewal chairman, said  that his party and allied groups of the Togolese Union for  Democracy had won the absolute majority in the future National  Assembly. The Togolese Government immediately disputed the  results of the second round of elections in several  constituencies where it claims the elections were marred by acts  of sabotage. The former sole ruling party, the RPT, has adopted  a similar position and is even going a step further by calling  for the annulment of the elections in the constituencies where  it claims there was fraud. Gachin Ayite Midevor, who is in  charge of coordination for RPT and the election campaign, speaks  to Raphael Mbadinga on the issue.    [Begin recording] [Midevor] At the moment, we are still  awaiting results from four constituencies. The RPT has issued a  statement on our readiness to cooperate in a broad sense with  the opposition in the next government. We have also noticed  that there was fraud in certain constituencies and we have  referred the matter to the Supreme Court. We are calling for  the annulment of elections in the constituencies where there was  fraud.    [Mbadinga] Are you ready to accept a prime minister who is  chosen from the ranks of the opposition?    [Midevor] Our Constitution stipulates that prime ministers  are chosen from the parliamentary majority. If the  parliamentary majority turns out to be from the opposition, we  cannot oppose that.

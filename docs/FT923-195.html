			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: IBM to take Dollars 2.8bn charge in third quarter INTERNATIONAL Business Machines (IBM) will take post-tax charges of Dollars 2.8bn in the current third quarter to cover a streamlining of its worldwide manufacturing capacity and additional workforce reductions. The charges will result in a net loss for the quarter, the company said. The charges will be partially offset by a change of accounting methods that will enable the company to recognise about Dollars 1.9bn in deferred tax assets. IBM added it now expects to reduce its worldwide workforce by about 40,000 this year, doubling its previous estimate. The company has already cut 28,000 in the US this year, through voluntary severance programmes which have now been closed. Similar programmes continue in international operations, however, and are expected to complete the 40,000 reduction. IBM will take a Dollars 2.1bn pre-tax charge against earnings to cover the costs of the additional workforce reductions. These charges will be spread over the third and fourth quarters. In addition, IBM said it will take a third-quarter, after-tax charge of Dollars 2.1bn for the cost of streamlining its manufacturing operations. This will involve consolidation of some operations and the write off of surplus buildings and equipment. It will not, according to an IBM spokesman, involve closure of plant sites or job cuts although some operations may be relocated. 'Our business units have been carefully evaluating their capacity requirements within an industry environment marked by rapid changes in technology, shifting marketplace demand and prolonged worldwide economic weakness,' said Mr John Akers, IBM chairman. With the actions announced yesterday, 'IBM will achieve an improved balance between assets and current business needs.' By year-end 1992, IBM will have reduced its worldwide force by approximately 25 per cent since 1985. Over the same period, IBM will have reduced its total manufacturing space by approximately 40 per cent. IBM said its cost and expense structure would be reduced by about Dollars 4bn annually, beginning in 1993, as a result of the capacity reductions announced yesterday and restructuring actions that were initiated in late 1991.</p>

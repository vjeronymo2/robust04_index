			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Cominco returns to the black Cominco, the Vancouver-based metals producer, staged a strong turnround in the third quarter as zinc, lead and copper prices rose. Recent performance has also been marked by 'highly encouraging' exploration results in northern Canada, Turkey and Chile, which could shift the emphasis of Cominco's operations from lead and zinc towards copper and gold. Third-quarter earnings reached CDollars 16.7m (USDollars 12.35m), or 20 cents a share, compared with a CDollars 70.2m loss, or 89 cents, a year earlier. Revenues climbed to CDollars 294.5m from CDollars 214m. Lead, zinc and copper prices on the London Metal Exchange were respectively 8 per cent, 53 per cent and 28 per cent higher during the third quarter than a year previously. Earnings were also boosted by higher production, including a 71 per cent jump in zinc concentrate output at the Red Dog mine in Alaska. Total shipments of refined zinc rose by a fifth. The most encouraging exploration prospect is a wholly owned polymetallic deposit in south-east Yukon. Cominco Resources International, its 56 per cent owned subsidiary, has announced 'promising' results from a low-grade gold deposit in Turkey, and the discovery of two 'significant' copper-bearing ore bodies in Chile. Third-quarter exploration expenses were CDollars 5.5m higher than last year.</p>

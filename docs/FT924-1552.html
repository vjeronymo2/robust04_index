			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Provisions push Daily Mail down THE DAILY Mail and General Trust yesterday announced a 28 per cent increase in profit before exceptional items. Pre-tax profits for the year to September 30, however, fell from Pounds 47.7m to Pounds 43.8m. The main factor pulling down the pre-tax line was a revaluation of the company's London investment properties. A total property provision of Pounds 26.5m was made, although this was partly offset by profits from the sale of a wharf in Purfleet and the disposal of 1.3m Reuter shares. The exceptional loss totalled Pounds 15.2m. The company yesterday described the performance of the group as 'satisfactory' and said the national newspaper division - the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday and the Evening Standard - had achieved record levels of circulation revenue and display advertising revenue. Classified advertising had been weaker, particularly at the Evening Standard. The company proposes a final dividend of 98p, making a total for the year of 130p against 119p. Turnover amounted to Pounds 663.8m (Pounds 644.1m), with newspapers, regional as well as national, ahead from Pounds 525.3m to Pounds 559.2m. Trading profits from newspapers rose from Pounds 59.9m to Pounds 70.6m. Mr Derek Terrington, publishing analyst at stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson, said: 'In this kind of market it goes back to basics and the strength of the titles.' Mr Terrington, who is forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 73m in 1993, believes that the period of fluctuations caused by exceptional losses or profits could be coming to an end. The group's regional newspapers also improved their position mainly because of close control of costs. Associated interests declined as a result of lower profits at the Bristol Evening Post and Whittle Communications in the US. There were also start up costs for stakes in two new broadcasting ventures, Westcountry Television and Teletext UK.</p>

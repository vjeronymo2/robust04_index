			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary agrees that it is more reasonable to completely exclude certain costs from the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund calculation, in effect allowing the institution to fully retain the money paid for those charges, rather than include the costs and assess them at a prorated percentage, only to then completely subtract them from the refund, thereby double-counting them. The Secretary wishes to clarify that the proration of educational costs under the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund calculation is required by the Amendments of 1992 and it is not the purpose or authority of these regulations to rescind that requirement. The Secretary agrees that an application fee is not an educational cost for Title IV, HEA program purposes and that it is therefore not relevant in the calculation of a refund. The Secretary does not believe that Congress intended to allow institutions to retain from a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund amount administrative charges that do not actually exist. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund calculation determines what portion of institutional charges paid can be retained by the institution; the Secretary believes it is unreasonable to allow the retention of a fee that was not in fact charged or paid. The statutory  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  calculation provides for the maximum amount of administrative costs that may be retained by the institution. The Secretary believes certain costs (i.e., passed-through room charges, and group health insurance fees) warrant treatment other than standard proration and has therefore specifically named such costs and proposed they be excluded from the calculation. The Secretary believes the specific regulation of the treatment of these costs will avoid institutional abuse of these allowances and ensure greater equity in the payment of refunds. After further consideration, the Secretary has found the provision treating irregularly expended meal credits to be unnecessarily complex and not entirely effective in its intended purpose. No commenters offered support for this provision or any alternative suggestions. This issue will be reexamined in the future and further input from the financial aid community will be sought. The Secretary recognizes that some institutions may elect to provide certain services, such as voluntary group health insurance, as a courtesy to students. The Secretary believes it is necessary to exclude from the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund calculation mandatory charges for group health insurance to prevent students from an unavoidable loss of insurance upon withdrawal. This situation could be avoided if the student had the option of purchasing health insurance from a source other than the institution. The Secretary does not believe the cost of specialized insurance coverage such as medical malpractice coverage warrants the same treatment as group health insurance costs, primarily because such specialized insurance is no longer needed by the student after withdrawal. The statute provides that all refunds other than  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refunds are to be made in accordance with State or accrediting agency standards. To extend the allowable exclusion for group health insurance fees to all refund calculations would necessitate an amendment to the law.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 668.22(c)(4) has been amended to reflect that certain fees, listed as allowable subtractions in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, are to be excluded entirely from the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund calculation. This section has also been amended to delete from that list of fees the reference to an application fee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters believed the cost of equipment, books and supplies should not be prorated, because possession of an item cannot be ``split'' between the institution and the student. The commenters believed the proposed treatment of books and supply costs will unjustifiably enable students to keep supplies they had not fully paid for, and will force institutions to either function as ``pawn shops'' for the return of such items or bear the costs of supplies they do not own. The commenters believed such a policy will force institutions to raise book and supply costs for students who remain or to stop providing supplies altogether, to the obvious detriment of continuing students. Two commenters believed institutions will be forced to instruct students to obtain supplies from independent vendors, resulting in great consumer risks for the student. One commenter suggested that the refund amount for equipment, book, and supply costs should be determined by the manufacturer of the individual products and passed on from the institution to the student accordingly. Several commenters asserted that equipment, books, and supplies become the sole property of the student when issued, and suggested the institution be allowed to withhold delivery and billing of such items until they are needed. The commenters also suggested the Secretary allow institutions to retain the full cost of unreturnable items issued and of returnable items issued that are not returned, and require institutions to refund in full the cost of any issued items that are returned and of any items that were not issued but for which the student was charged. Several commenters stated that the return of certain supplies, books, or equipment is unrealistic and burdensome, regardless of the condition in which it is returned, and that the regulations should therefore not require institutions to accept returned items. One commenter supported the Secretary's proposed treatment of charges for returned equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Amendments of 1992 require all institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA programs to refund unearned tuition, fees, room and board,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> and other charges  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> to a student who received Title IV, HEA program assistance and failed to complete the period of enrollment for which the student was charged. The Secretary does not believe Congress intended to exclude the unearned cost of books, supplies, and equipment from the refund amount. However, the Secretary agrees that institutions should not be expected to refund to the student a portion of the cost of unreturnable items that were actually issued to the student and kept by the student. The Secretary wishes to clarify that the proposed requirements governing books, supplies, and equipment will not force an institution to accept returned merchandise; rather, the proposed provision allows an institution to state that an item is returnable and to then retain in full the cost of that item if it is not returned, provided the institution clearly disclosed in the enrollment agreement any restrictions on the return of equipment, including equipment that is unreturnable and deadlines for returns. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 668.22(c)(5) has been amended to allow an institution to exclude from the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund calculation the documented cost of any unreturnable equipment, books, and supplies issued to the student, if the student was informed in the enrollment agreement that the item is unreturnable and may keep the item, or under what conditions normally returnable equipment is considered to be unreturnable. A corresponding change has been made to appendix A. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters asserted that the definition of a first-time student should be limited to a student attending any postsecondary institution for the first time. Three commenters disagreed with the Secretary's proposal to include in the first-time student definition any student who previously enrolled at the institution but received a 100 percent refund of tuition and fees. One commenter asked the Secretary to amend the first-time student definition to include students who previously enrolled only in continuing education courses that do not lead to a degree. One commenter requested the Secretary to issue one consistent definition of a first-time student, instead of expecting institutions to use different definitions for different Department requirements, such as IPEDS, refund calculations, FFEL programs counseling, and student consumerism. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

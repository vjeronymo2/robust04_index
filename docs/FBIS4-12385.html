			<p>BFN     [Text] After his meeting with Foreign Minister Faris  Buwayz, Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana said that Lebanon  is an important country in the region. He stressed the need to  strengthen ties between Lebanon and Spain. He emphasized his  country's commitment to the peace process in the Middle East.  He hoped that the process that was launched from Madrid will  continue. He said that discussion of the peace process is one  of the goals of his visit to Lebanon. He noted Spanish-Lebanese  understanding about reaching a fair solution to the Middle East  problem. He pointed out that Minister Buwayz broached several  points and Spain supports Lebanon's position on the peace  negotiations, particularly implementation of Security Council  Resolution 425. On the conditions required to make the peace  process successful, Solana said: There is a working framework  for negotiations on all tracks. In my view, the Palestinian  track has achieved success and this result will appear in the  next few days, which is mine and everyone's wish. I support  what Minister Buwayz said, that the time factor is important for  the progress of the negotiations. He said that any slowdown in  the talks would not be in the interest of moderation or the  parties concerned, but would open the way for extremists to  obstruct the peace process in the Middle East. He said: Spain  and Lebanon support the establishment of peace in the near  future and we will defend this position.</p>

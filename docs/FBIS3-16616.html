			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Aleksey Agureyev and Vladimir </F> Gondusov]    [Text] Moscow March 17 TASS -- Russia may join the  "Partnership for Peace" initiative as early as the end of March,  Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev told journalists on  Thursday after finishing a meeting with United States Secretary  of Defence William Perry.    "The groups of experts are already finishing their study of  Russia's approach to joining 'Partnership for Peace,'" Grachev  pointed out. "Basing our approach on Russia's particular needs,  we will be ready to join the initiative already by the end of  the month", he reported. The public will soon be able to have a  look at the fundamental propositions of Russia's relationship  with the partnership programme, he stated.    ITAR-TASS asked the defence ministers to comment on reports  that the Pentagon in the near future intends to approve the  allocation of funds to Russian and American corporations which  will specialize in constructing housing for military personnel  transferred to the reserves and in converting military  enterprises to civilian production.    The American Defence Secretary announced that he would be  discussing this topic with his Russian colleagues on Thursday  and Friday. These talks should lead to the implementation of a  joint programme which should require 60 to 100 million dollars  in the next year, Perry said.    The defence secretary stated that his talks with Grachev  focused on three global problems. First, the two sides had a  good, positive discussion about the deepening of their working  relations. Second, the partnership for peace initiative was  discussed. Third, they discussed ways of improving  Russian-American cooperation in Bosnia in order to speed up the  peace process in that region, Perry explained.    During their discussion of the Bosnian question, the two  sides agreed to cooperate as equal partners, he said.    The aim of their cooperation in bosnia is the continuation  of  talks with the Muslims, Croatians, and Bosnians in order to  hasten the development of a peace agreement for the region,  Perry said. Such an agreement would be in the interests of the  United States, Russia, and all the countries in southeastern  Europe.    Both ministers emphasized the importance of relations  between  their two departments in determining the character of relations  between their respective countries. That is why a lot of  attention during the meeting was paid to personal contacts  between representatives of the two ministries, they said.</p>

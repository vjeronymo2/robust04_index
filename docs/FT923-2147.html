			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Observer: Not all bad Renault Vehicules Industriels, an arm of the French carmaker, has come up with one of the less attractive examples of Franglais. Yesterday's interim statement mentions the 1991 first half pre-tax losses of FFr128m 'apres badwill'. Badwill? Yes, says Renault cheerfully, it is the opposite of goodwill and, rather than being a bad thing, is actually something of a windfall. It had paid less than it expected to acquire full control (in 1990) of Mack Trucks in the US, so le badwill is a pot of money that turned up because the provisions made in advance of the acquisition were too generous. Vive la difference.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alexis Papakhelas from Washington] </F>   [Text] According to intense rumors that have been  circulating lately in the U.S. State Department, U.S. Ambassador  in Athens Thomas Niles will soon be replaced by Stephen Oxman,  the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. These  rumors have drawn a strong reaction from career diplomats, who  believe it would be awkward to remove Niles early in order to  "accommodate" a political figure who is being removed from the  Clinton administration.    Oxman succeeded Niles in his position as assistant secretary  of state for European affairs, but two weeks ago it was decided  to replace him because of ineffectiveness. Oxman is a close  friend of the Clinton family and maintains excellent relations  with Congress. Niles was appointed by former President George  Bush and is connected to the Republican Party. The White House  will make a final decision in the next few weeks.</p>

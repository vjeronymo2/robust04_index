			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Cash pledged for poorer EC nations  -Economic and monetary union BRITAIN will pay to help the four poorest European Community countries become members of a European economic and monetary union even if the UK decides against joining Emu, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said yesterday. Mr Lamont told the Common's Treasury and Civil Service committee that the UK had agreed under the Maastricht Treaty to contribute to a 'cohesion fund' which would help the four countries upgrade their economies towards the European average. Even if the UK parliament decides against joining Emu towards the end of this decade, Britain would be paying through the fund towards improving the environment and transport infrastructure of countries where gross national product per head was at or below 90 per cent of the EC average. Assuming that the wealth rankings of EC countries stay unchanged until union, Portugal, Greece, the Irish Republic and Spain could expect funds from Britain to help them become part of Emu with its single currency and European central bank. The size of the fund has still to be negotiated among member states and the chancellor insisted that the government would oppose 'huge transfers' of resources as part of the programme. But his disclosure that the government had accepted the principle of the cohesion fund while reserving the right not to join Emu clearly surprised some members of the all-party committee. Mr Lamont said that the government's decision on joining Emu would depend on its view of the sustainability and size of the union.</p>

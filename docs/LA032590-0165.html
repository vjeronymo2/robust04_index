			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FRENZY STIRRED UP OVER MEDFLY SPRAYING IS SCARY  </P> <P> The current hysteria over malathion spraying exemplifies how easy it is for the  press and a few protesters (originally) to whip the general public into a  frenzy, and that worries me more than the pesticide.  </P> <P> The flu season, one of the worst in years, is in full swing, but every  fruitcake who comes down with flu symptoms now blames it on the spraying.  </P> <P> Others complain of headaches, stomachaches, breathing difficulties, etc. It  doesn't surprise me. These are the same symptoms as anxiety, and these people  have worked themselves into a tizzy over nothing.  </P> <P> We use malathion, according to manufacturer's instructions, for fleas in the  summer (we don't have cats or dogs but our neighbors do and their pets pass  through our yards). Anyway, the state is using .000049 of an ounce of malathion  per square foot (about .9 of an ounce over our one-third acre lot), whereas we  use five ounces per gallon of water.  </P> <P> I can't help but wonder how many of those standing around screaming about the  spraying eat junk foods (especially sugar-laden and high-cholesterol), smoke,  drink alcohol, etc.  </P> <P> I think it's pathetically hysterical that the cast of "Cheers" joined  protesters recently. These people are doing a show that glorifies booze, not to  mention sex. Don't they know how harmful drinking (and the drunk driver) is to  one's health?  </P> <P> So, do I think malathion is harmful to my health? Only if my neighbors read  this. They have been so brainwashed and frightened by the media and  office-seeking politicians, they will probably stone me!  </P> <P> BRENDA HESTER  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

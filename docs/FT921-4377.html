			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Poll war to begin after Budget THE starting gun for the 1992 general election will be fired moments after 3.30pm today when Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, begins his much-anticipated Budget statement. As tension continued to mount at Westminster yesterday, nervous MPs impatiently awaited an end to the 'phoney war' and the declaration of a full-blown election campaign. Mr John Major, the prime minister, is expected to give formal notice of the ballot at the pre-Budget session of the cabinet today, confirming that he has opted for a general election on April 9. An official statement may be delayed until tomorrow or even Thursday. But there are no longer any residual doubts in the Commons that the chancellor's words will be the first shot in the closest political struggle since the 1970s. Rarely has so much been riding on a Budget. Mr Lamont will emerge from a pre-Budget purdah, in which there has been no sign of recovery from recession, to face the biggest challenge of his political career. In recent days, however, the more extravagant expectations of a massive pre-election giveaway have been replaced by forecasts that the chancellor will announce a balanced package with a net tax reduction of no more than Pounds 3bn in 1992-93. The aim will be to appeal to a cross-section of voters while presenting the Budget as one for economic recovery. It will also serve as a manifesto for future tax reforms if the Conservatives win the election. A 1p cut in the basic rate of income tax from 25p is expected to be at the heart of Mr Lamont's second Budget. He is also thought to be planning to increase the thresholds before which income tax takes effect by more than the statutory 4.5 per cent indexation. This would help the lower paid. Lowering the basic rate by 1p would cost the Treasury Pounds 1.95bn while each percentage point increase in all income tax allowances and thresholds in addition to indexation would cost about Pounds 245m. That means the chancellor will be looking to recoup revenue elsewhere if, as expected, he is also to help industry and small businesses. Downing Street confirmed last night that Mr Major has a longstanding meeting with the Queen at 6.30pm tomorrow. This had been put back from Tuesday in order not to clash with the Budget. It is understood, however, that the meeting could be rescheduled at short notice. A dissolution of Parliament would not have to be announced until the following day. Yesterday, financial markets waited calmly for the Budget. Equities advanced, the FT-SE 100 index closing at 2,550.7, up 17.6, but trading was subdued. Sterling stayed at the bottom of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, losing half a pfennig to DM2.8650. But it gained 0.45 cents to Dollars 1.723, helping to lift the Bank of England's trade weighted exchange rate index to 90.0 from 89.9 on Friday evening. In New York sterling closed at Dollars 1.7255 and at DM2.86885. Budget Special, Page 12 Observer and Mowlam interview, Page 20 Joe Rogaly, Page 21 Lex, Page 22</p>

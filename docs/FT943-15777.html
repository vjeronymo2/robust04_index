			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / International Company News: Labatt and Femsa in N America beer tie-up John Labatt, the Canadian brewing and entertainment group, has joined Femsa, Mexico's biggest beverage company, in a North American beer alliance. It will give Labatt access to the fast-growing Mexican beer market, while providing Femsa with marketing and technical expertise to shore up recent erosion of its market share. Labatt will initially pay USDollars 510m for a 22 per cent stake in Cerveceria Cuauhtemoc-Moctezuma, Femsa's wholly-owned brewing arm. It will have an option to acquire another 8 per cent over the next three years. Femsa will retain a 51 per cent stake, and the remainder will be offered to Mexican and international investors in a public offering. Labatt will nominate five of Femsa Cerveza's 18 directors, while Mr Othon Ruiz Montemayor, Femsa chief executive, will join Labatt's board. The deal is expected to be finalised by the end of September. Labatt is best known in the UK for its popular Rolling Rock beer and in North America for its controlling stake in the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team. The two companies, which are of similar size, will also form a joint venture in the US to distribute high-priced specialty beers, and plan a joint assault on other Latin American markets. They raised the possibility yesterday of either spinning off a minority stake in the US company to the public or offering it to another foreign brewer eager to expand in the huge US market. The Labatt-Femsa partnership undercuts the 1992 acquisition by Philip Morris, the US consumer goods group, of an 8 per cent equity stake in Femsa. The investment was partly designed to lay a foundation for closer ties between Femsa Cerveza and Miller Brewing, a wholly-owned Philip Morris subsidiary. Mr Ruiz said yesterday Femsa had considered an alliance with Miller, among others, but that Labatt had proved to be the best fit. 'It's up to (Philip Morris) to decide if they keep the shares, or sell the shares, or whatever,' he said. Femsa Cerveza, with projected 1994 sales of Dollars 1.56bn, has a 48 per cent share of the Mexican beer market, down from more than 50 per cent a few years ago. Labatt's investment is by far the largest of any Canadian company in Mexico since the implementation of the North American free trade agreement in January 1994.</p>

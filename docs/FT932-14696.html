			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Blizzard of publicity for Mars 'GOOD old Brits came through with a Mars bar,' said the front-page headline. Now Mars, the confectionery company, has launched an advertising campaign to capitalise on the tale of the four British climbers who were rescued on Thursday after spending six days stranded in the Russian Caucasus mountains with their local guide. Since the first Mars bar emerged from the original factory at Slough, Berkshire, in 1932, Mars has probably spent more on advertising than the annual gross domestic products of some countries. In the UK alone last year the confectionery company spent Pounds 5.6m on advertising the Mars bar. For Mars the story of the climbers has been a case of some of the best publicity coming free. One public-relations executive said: 'You can't even buy (advertising space) on the front pages of the tabloids. The first page you can buy in the Daily Star is page 11, and that will cost you thousands.' The confectionery company is backing up the welcome free publicity with its own advertising campaign. Today the British press is saturated with large advertisements from Mars, featuring the part the chocolate bar played in the survival of the lost climbers. They are said to have endured the ordeal sustained only by snow and three Mars bars. Mars said yesterday: 'We're obviously absolutely delighted for the chaps themselves. The fact they had the presence of mind to take Mars bars with them is a terrific bonus.' Out of near-tragedy, Mars has gained an almost priceless marketing benefit - not just masses of free publicity, as the tabloids latched onto the story, but an endorsement for its most famous product splashed across front pages of national newspapers. Mars did admit, however, to being a little puzzled. 'It's bizarre . . . clearly there is not sufficient nutrition in a Mars bar to keep one person going for a whole day, let alone five of them for more than one day,' the company said. So today's campaign does its best to reinforce the company's advertising slogan: - 'A Mars a day helps you work, rest and play'. Today's hurriedly created advertisements welcome back the four British climbers, adding: 'Thank goodness they took their Mars bars with them.' But for Mars, the most important message to get across is the punchline: 'There really is life on Mars.'</p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Australian Gas Light Company dividend static AUSTRALIAN Gas Light Company (AGL), the Sydney-based gas utility, is holding its annual dividend at 14 cents a share writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney. This follows a 6 per cent rise in earnings before abnormals to ADollars 58.4m (USDollars 42m) for the 12 months to June from ADollars 55.1m a year before. The result followed a 6 per cent advance in sales to ADollars 896.2m from ADollars 844.9m. Borrowings were reduced by ADollars 193m to ADollars 559m in the year, mainly through a ADollars 116m rights issue. Mr Jack Davenport, chairman, said the company was continuing an orderly disposal of its property interests, with proceeds of ADollars 52m in the year. He said the purchase of a large stake in Natural Gas Corporation for up to ADollars 139m was consistent with AGL's strategy of growth in industries it knows best.</p>

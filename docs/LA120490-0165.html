			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> BANGLADESH LEADER TO QUIT SOON  </P> <P> President Hussain Mohammed Ershad bowed to an increasingly violent campaign for  his ouster and agreed today to quit as soon as the opposition nominates a  replacement, state radio said.  </P> <P> Parliament will meet Saturday to try to choose a successor, the radio said in a  late-night news bulletin.  </P> <P> Ershad had offered Monday to step down shortly before elections scheduled for  June, but the opposition, which had staged a seven-week campaign to drive him  from office, rebuffed that offer and demanded he step down now.  </P> <P> The 60-year-old former army general took over Bangladesh, one of the world's  poorest countries, in a bloodless coup in 1982. He had declared a state of  emergency Nov. 27 to quash the opposition campaign seeking his ouster.  </P> <P> Immediately after the announcement, hundreds of opposition workers thronged the  streets of the capital, chanting slogans and setting off firecrackers.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Olivier Provost: "French-German Arms Agency To </F> Be Established Soon"]    [Text] According to the Defense Ministry, this organization  will be created next year. It will be allocated the 4.5 billion  francs [Fr] earmarked annually for military cooperation and will  focus on bilateral military programs.    The 63d Franco-German summit held last week in Mulhouse has  given impetus to the proposed Franco-German arms "structure" --  there is no talk of it having the status of a formal agency,  although officials recognize it will be very similar. The  process appears to be in its final stage as the French Defense  Ministry has now set a deadline for the creation of the  structure: September 1995, that is, in a little over a year's  time. The quasi-agency set up by Paris and Bonn is expected to  integrate bilateral weapon programs ("Tigre" assault helicopter,  antitank missiles, the VBM modular armored vehicle.) But it  will also include Franco-German participation in joint programs  with third parties (NH-90 helicopter, ATF heavy transport  aircraft, satellites, etc.). This, in cases where the combined  French and German shares exceed 50 percent of a program, will  amount to a virtual takeover of the project on the part of Paris  and Bonn. The Franco-German arms agency will also cover  bilateral research and technology, for which there are already  80 projects. This has already had the effect of prompting some  harmonization, including in preliminary research for helicopter  design, a field in which, despite the creation of Eurocopter  (Aerospatiale, 70 percent; Deutsche Aerospace, 30 percent),  resources remained to be pooled. The Franco-German agency will  also work on future equipment for the Eurocorps, which is mostly  made up of French and German soldiers. Last, it will integrate  parameter studies for long-term military planning (up to  2010-2015), as well as the first preliminary technical and  operational studies on future threats.    The annual cost of this Franco-German cooperation will total  Fr4.5 billion out of the French Armed forces' Fr100-billion  equipment budget. The project will produce some items, mostly  missiles, but its main focus will be development (of armored  vehicles, helicopters.) Overall, it will cost its French and  German sponsors more than Fr60 billion. This makes a compelling  case for such an agency, which in future could be opened up to  Belgium and the Netherlands; the latter maintain close ties with  the Germans, including a joint army corps. Paris has even been  considering establishing another quasi-agency with the Italians,  who have been working with France on several large programs (a  torpedo, a satellite, the Aster missile, the NH-90 helicopter.)  Such an increased focus on cooperation is firmly rooted in  reality. Today, on the eve of the implementation of the  1995-2000 military programming law, the share of cooperation in  France's defense programs budget is 25 percent. By the end of  the programming period, in the year 2000, it will have reached  40 percent, a boom that will require an appropriate structure.  <H5>  [Box, p 10] </H5> <H5>  Research Credits to Small Companies To Be Doubled </H5>   On the occasion of the fifth birthday of the Richelieu  Committee, which includes 75 percent of the small- and  medium-sized businesses [SME] active in the defense field (92  firms), DGA [General Armament Delegation] Director Henri Conze  said: ``I ask all DGA operational directorates to at least  maintain and even increase the preliminary research credits  allocated to SME's from one year to the next, whatever happens  to the Defense Ministry's research budgets.    ``Furthermore, the DGA will endeavor to double the share of  SME's in its budget for preliminary research by the end of the  current programming period: Thus, within six years we must  increase from 6 to 12 percent preliminary research credits  allocated to SME's.''</p>

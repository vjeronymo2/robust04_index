			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (9): No nasty late surprises - Year-end tax planning / A November Budget leaves time for thought. And investment decisions should not be based on tax-saving alone, lest you lose more than you save For the first time, investors can plan their end-of-tax-year finances without the fear that last-minute surprises will pop out of the chancellor's budget briefcase. These were unleashed in November, and investors will have had plenty of time to digest the effects by the end of the tax year. However, John Cole, at Berry Birch and Noble, independent financial advisers, warns against leaving action until the last minute: 'The mad scramble to make financial decisions at the end of the tax year is to be avoided. Better to plan ahead and make decisions at a more leisurely pace during the year.' It is also worth remembering that no tax-planning measure should be based solely on the amount of tax which might be saved. If the underlying investment is not sound, investors will lose much more than any potential tax saving. The main areas are: Income tax Those who are happily married should make use of all personal allowances, and transfer assets to the lower-rate taxpayer to avoid paying higher-rate tax on them. James Higgins, of fee-based adviser Chamberlain de Broe, says: 'This is particularly important for older couples, where age allowance can be reduced or lost by having too much income arising in the wrong name. For example, people should watch out for maturing guaranteed income bonds.' The married couple's allowance is automatically allocated to the husband. Tax relief will be restricted to only 20 per cent in the 1994-95 tax year, instead of up to 40 per cent, so there is no longer any point in transferring the whole allowance to the wife unless the husband is a non-taxpayer. An election for a transfer or split must be made before the end of this tax year for 1994-95. Frank Akers-Douglas, of chartered accountant BDO Binder Hamlyn, reminds parents that their children each have a personal allowance of Pounds 3,445 for the current tax year, and advises parents to use them up; for example, through distributions from non-parental discretionary trusts. Non-taxpayers with building society accounts should register before the end of the tax year in order to receive the whole of next tax year's building society interest gross. Capital gains tax Everyone has a CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800 in the current tax year. The abolition of indexation to increase or create losses from Budget day will have deprived many investors of the ability to reduce their CGT bill, while others will face a bill which they might otherwise have escaped. However, those who would like to reinvest gains in an unquoted trading company can roll over their CGT liability by doing so. Otherwise, investors should try to 'bed-and-breakfast' shares by selling them one day and buying them back the next, to use up their annual exemption. There are costs involved - broker's commission and stamp duty - so it is important to calculate whether these outweigh the benefits. Crystallising gains by selling and buying back shares will reduce a future CGT bill, because a higher base will have been established. Cole says: 'As an alternative to bed-and-breakfasting, many people are now bed-and-pepping - selling shares and repurchasing within the tax-free environment of a personal equity plan on a self-select basis.' This is only suitable for those who have not already used up their annual Pep allowance (see Investments, below). Akers-Douglas advises against selling an asset with a large gain near the end of the tax year. By deferring the sale until after April 5, the tax will be delayed for a further 12 months. Since CGT is payable at an investor's marginal rate, Cole suggests creating gains in a spouse's name, if the spouse is in the lower-rate tax band, by transferring the assets to them first. Inheritance tax IHT is not payable on the first Pounds 150,000 of someone's estate when they die. An individual can limit their estate to this figure by giving away their wealth, but such gifts will be 'potentially exempt transfers' unless the donor survives for seven years. However, annual gifts of up to Pounds 3,000 are not dependent on this time restriction. The relief can be carried forward for one year only, so a married couple could collectively give away Pounds 12,000 without any IHT liability. In addition, someone can make limitless small gifts of up to Pounds 250 (but not more than Pounds 250 to any single individual). Value Added Tax Fuel bills will increase from April 1, when VAT at 8 per cent is imposed, but the tax can be avoided by buying the year's domestic fuel in advance. This is because VAT is charged at the rate that applies at the date of invoice or payment, whichever is earlier. Pensions Pensions are highly tax-efficient, since premiums are grossed up and are invested in a tax-free fund. However, benefits cannot be drawn until retirement. Those with a personal pension can use 'carry back' provisions, allowing them to mop up unused tax relief from any of the last six tax years, which is particularly useful for self-employed people with fluctuating annual earnings. 'If someone wants to reduce his or her 1992-93 income tax bill, a contribution must be made before April 5,' said Higgins. 'The investor then has until July 5 before making the election to carry back. Some people confuse these two dates - the payment must actually be made before the year end for it to be carried back to the previous year.' Those in a company pension scheme, who are eligible to a top up, can do so with additional voluntary contributions. Unused reliefs cannot be swept up in later years, so the maximum contribution into an AVC must be made by the end of this tax year. Investments A personal equity plan allows investors to hold shares, investment or unit trusts investing in UK and other EC equities, free of income tax and CGT. The investment limits are Pounds 6,000 a tax year into a general Pep, and another Pounds 3,000 into a single-company Pep. Those wanting to invest the maximum must do so before the end of the tax year, but charges on a Pep tend to make them most worthwhile only to a higher-rate taxpayer. The Business Expansion Scheme, which allowed full income and CGT relief on an annual investment of Pounds 40,000, has been replaced by the less generous Enterprise Investment Scheme. This gives tax relief of 20 per cent on a maximum investment of Pounds 100,000 in a qualifying trading company. The final legislation will not be in place until the Finance Bill receives royal assent.</p>

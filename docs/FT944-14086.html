			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Business and the Law: Long arm of US regulations - Terry Calvani on draft guidelines for the application of antitrust laws abroad The application of American antitrust, or competition, laws outside the US has long been a source of friction between the US and its trading partners. The international business community has suffered from not knowing how far US regulators will go in asserting jurisdiction over anti-competitive conduct outside US borders. In spite of guidelines issued by previous US administrations, and several attempts to clarify the issue in the US Supreme Court, that uncertainty not only remains but appears to have increased. Ten days ago, the Clinton administration at long last published its draft Antitrust Enforcement Guidelines for International Operations. The new guidelines should be of interest to business executives, trade associations and their lawyers as an indication of the current administration's intentions to enforce US antitrust laws abroad. Since this raises the prospect of foreign nationals being prosecuted by US authorities for anti-competitive conduct that takes place outside the US and that is legal in their home country, it involves delicate questions of law and public policy. Though the guidelines are only in draft form, they are important. Although the guidelines address numerous issues, the extraterritorial application of US antitrust law is the centrepiece. Assertion of US antitrust laws abroad has had a tortuous and controversial history. In 1909, the US Supreme Court ruled that the legality of conduct must be determined by the law of the place where it occurred. This 'presumption of territoriality' was relied on by US courts to determine the reach of Federal legislation until 1945 when, in the Aluminum Co of America (Alcoa) case, the Supreme Court adopted what became known as the 'effects test'. The justices ruled the US may impose liability on persons not within its allegiance for conduct that took place outside its borders if it has an effect within the US. This statement of the law was adopted by the US courts and ultimately refined into the principle that any conduct having a direct, substantial and reasonably foreseeable effect on US commerce is subject to US jurisdiction. The 'effects test' is now embraced by many governments and the European Union. The new guidelines assert US jurisdiction over foreign cartels (two or more companies which collude to fix prices or divide markets) that make substantial sales into the US. It does not matter if the cartel is wholly located outside the US, administered by foreign nationals and is legal in its home country. It does not matter if the cartel does not sell directly into the US, but through intermediaries, or if the price of its goods into the US is lower than the 'competitive price', which would benefit US consumers. And it does not matter if it is a buyer cartel seeking lower prices. In keeping with recent cases against Japanese companies, the guidelines assert jurisdiction over wholly foreign cartels where there is not even a price effect within the US, but where the US government substantially funds the purchase of goods or services consumed abroad. Thus foreign cartel activity associated, for example, with a US Agency for International Development project abroad may be subject to US antitrust jurisdiction. Embracing a change of policy made under the Bush administration, the new guidelines also assert jurisdiction over cartels that restrict US export opportunities. This would capture combinations of foreign companies (including trade associations) that adopt standards that hinder the ability of US companies to export their products. In the context of mergers, the guidelines assert jurisdiction over the merger of two foreign companies, neither of which has a subsidiary or productive assets in the US, but which make sales into the US. While the prospect of dealing with several merger authorities may warm the hearts of competition lawyers, business executives may be less enthusiastic. The guidelines are also important for what they do not say. Previous international guidelines were an excellent repository of guidance on, for example, how the US government would assess the competitive consequences of joint ventures - domestic as well as foreign. Similarly, they contained the best analysis of the government's views on assessing concentration among competitors at auctions. While it is arguable that these provisions were not unique to transnational issues and belonged elsewhere, their absence from the new international guidelines leaves business executives and their lawyers without guidance. Does the rescission of the previous guidelines and the failure of the new ones to address these issues signal a change of policy on joint venture analysis? The curious thing about the guidelines is not their content. On the issue of the extraterritorial application of antitrust laws, the guidance is simply the 'effects test' writ large. The puzzle is why the US wants to convey the message at all. Under US law it is permissible to abduct foreign nationals from their own countries, take them back to the US and put them on trial for offences under US law which took place abroad. Assuming that such a law is appropriate and generally would not be found offensive, it would be curious to see the US government trumpeting the virtues of such a policy. Such laws, it might be expected, would be employed sparingly and only where there was a strong national interest at stake that warranted the compromise of another nation's sovereignty. While there is nothing within the new guidelines that is at odds with an aggressive application of the 'effects test', one might question whether the prominent proclamation of the guidelines is consistent with a friction-free system of international antitrust co-operation. The timing of the new guidelines is also curious. It is no secret that the Clinton administration would like to see more international agreements that facilitate US antitrust investigations abroad. The recently enacted International Antitrust Enforcement Assistance Act 1994 would further that objective. These guidelines would seem to undermine that effort. It is unlikely that foreign trade departments will view them as an early Christmas present. Indeed, many may wonder whether the new US guidelines signal a renewed interest in the jingoistic application of US antitrust abroad, and should be met with opposition rather than co-operation. The draft guidelines should provoke interesting responses. The author is a partner in US law firm Pillsbury Madison &amp; Sutro and former commissioner of the US Federal Trade Commission, 1983-90</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Headline turns the page for Hodder AUTHORS such as television personality Cilla Black and champion jockey Peter Scudamore are teaming up with Winston Churchill, John Buchan and John le Carre. Such diverse talent is being brought under one roof in a Pounds 48.9m takeover by seven-year-old upstart Headline Book Publishing of the stately 125-year-old Hodder &amp; Stoughton. The recommended offer is likely to create in Hodder Headline the second largest independent UK publisher after Macmillan. It will be worth close to Pounds 100m. Mr Tim Hely Hutchinson, the 39-year-old founder of Headline, said yesterday that substantial savings would flow from the deal. Hodder Headline would also have greatly increased resources to move aggressively in the marketplace. 'If it makes sense to offer an author a Pounds 3m multi-book deal we will do it,' said Mr Hely Hutchinson, who will be group chief executive. Headline, a specialist in popular commercial publishing, has 76.8 per cent acceptances for the privately held Hodder shares. Most of the 120 shareholders are descended from founders of the company, set up as an evangelical publisher. Hodder shareholders are being offered 37.5 new Headline shares for each of theirs. The paper offer is worth Pounds 108.75 a share, the partial cash version Pounds 90. Headline is also raising Pounds 12.8m in a four-for-nine rights issue at 240p a share. The merged group will move into new central London headquarters but the two sales forces will remain separate. Hodder's wide range of publishing - from general fiction and non-fiction to children's books and religion - will be retained. Although both companies are trading profitably, exceptional merger costs might lead to a pre-tax loss this year. Apart from stepping up in size, Headline is getting access to a profitable backlist of more than 5,000 titles. And the venerable Hodder is also way ahead of Headline in 'non-book' products, ranging from audio and video tapes to CD-Roms. Hodder is about to launch Worshipmaster, a product that could revolutionise the lives of Church of England vicars. The computer programme will produce suitable texts, readings and hymns for specific Sundays of the year. Mr Philip Attenborough and Mr Patrick Wright, who have run Hodder, will become deputy chairman and deputy chief executive respectively of Hodder Headline.</p>

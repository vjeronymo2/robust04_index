			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Property: Swiss snap up Joel's stud - Cadogan's Place This week, Gerald Cadogan, the Weekend FT's newly-appointed residential property correspondent, starts a fortnightly column of news and views on the property market: GOOD NEWS for British racing, as the Cheltenham Festival nears, is that Swiss connections of the Marquesa de Moratalla have bought the late Jim Joel's stud at Childwick Bury, Hertfordshire. Joel bred many famous horses including Royal Palace, Fairy Footsteps and Light Cavalry. The Marquesa, who owns Sybillin and The Fellow, currently Gold Cup favourite, may increase her involvement in racing there. Agents Strutt &amp; Parker have not disclosed the sum. In September, when Childwick came on the market, the guide price was Pounds 2.5m. In Ireland, at Cashel, Co. Tipperary, the late Percy Harris's Athassel Stud will be auctioned on March 31. Its best known winners are Double Jump and Maelstrom Lake. The early Victorian house comes with several yards, 40 loose boxes and 93 acres. The guide price, a fraction of Childwick's, is more than Pounds 350,000, or over Pounds 200,000 for the house alone and 28 acres. Agents in Dublin are Hamilton Osborne King (01-676-0251). The pop world comes to market. Dave Stewart, of the Eurhythmics, is selling his London home in Randolph Avenue, Maida Vale. The house, on offer from Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-629-8171) at around Pounds 500,000 freehold, looks traditional enough from the outside. Inside the stairs and halls are painted with trompe l'oeil urns and ruins. Near Rickmansworth, in Hertfordshire, John Reid, manager of Elton John, is selling Lockwell House, built in 1911. It has masses of rooms, 15 acres and the trimmings we expect of showbiz - a newly-built leisure complex with gymnasium, sauna and billiard room (complete with film screen descending from the ceiling), tennis court, swimming pool and floodlit helicopter pad. It could be yours for around Pounds 1.95m, through Savills (071-499-8644). At the opposite extreme a sixth-floor studio, with bathroom and kitchenette, in a portered block in Grosvenor Street, London W1 would be ideal for a regular visitor who does not want to pay hotel bills. And the price? Chestertons Residential (071-629-4513) invites best offers over Pounds 40,000 by noon on Thursday March 18. The following day best offers over Pounds 200,000 close for a Grade II manor house at Bittadon Barton in north Devon, with John Smale in Barnstaple (0271-42000) and Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Exeter (0392-433033). It is a 17th century building with splendid outbuildings but needs money spent on it. The agents have found that informal tendering works well for properties needing investment and two recent properties in Devon have easily exceeded the guide price. For the last six weeks anyone wanting to repair a property but needing access via a neighbour's land, has been able to apply to the courts for an access order. The Access to Neighbouring Land Act 1992 allowing people on to others' land to carry out basic preservation to their own property, came into in force on January 31. Simmons &amp; Simmons (071-628-2020) has issued a note explaining how it works entitled Love Thy Neighbour. Halifax Building Society has published its second House Names Survey. The top five, with the first three the same as in 1988, are: The Bungalow; The Cottage; Rose Cottage; The Lodge and Hillcrest. Shangri La, Chez Nous and Casa Mia are still popular, but Dunroamin is restricted to Scotland, south east England and Yorkshire.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: MRCB in MDollars 1.6bn contract Malaysian Resources Corp (MRCB), a Malaysian conglomerate involved mainly in the property, media and power sectors, has won a MDollars 1.6bn (USDollars 579.7m) contract to install power transmission lines for Tenaga Nasional, the country's partially privatised electricity utility. National Grid, of the UK, is a leading contender to take a 20 per cent stake in a new company formed to undertake the project. MRCB and Permodalan Nasional, the Malaysian state investment corporation, will each take a 40 per cent share in the new venture. MRCB has risen to prominence over the past 18 months and is seen as a company closely allied to Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's deputy prime minister and finance minister. Early last year, MRCB took control of the New Straits Times group, Malaysia's biggest publishing company, and TV3, the country's only independent TV station. Last year a unit of MRCB was also awarded the licence to build a 1,300MW power plant in the north of Malaysia. The plant forms part of the country's programme of privatising a substantial portion of its power generating facilities. National Grid yesterday would not comment on the Malaysian transmission project. However, recently it said it was prepared to invest up to Pounds 350m (USDollars 511m) in overseas ventures. The Pacific rim offered considerable investment opportunities for the company, it said. Ekran, a Malaysian timber and construction company, has signed agreements with the Philippines government to develop a USDollars 100m tourist resort on Samal island, in the southern Philippines, writes Kieran Cooke. Ekran says it will be building hotels, a golf course, a casino and other facilities on Samal.</p>

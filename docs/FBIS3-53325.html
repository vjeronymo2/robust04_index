			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tehran Voice of the Islamic Republic of  Iran First Program Network in Persian at 0905 GMT on 13 January  broadcasts the "In Line With the People, in Step With the  Officials" phone-in program. This week's program, which lasts  88 minutes, features five senior officials of the Islamic  Revolution Guards Corps [IRGC]: Brigadier General Seyyed Rahim  Safavi, the deputy commander of the IRGC; Brigadier General  Mohammad Baqer Zolqadr, the head of the IRGC's Joint Staff;  Hojjat ol-Eslam val Moslemin Razini, deputy to Ayatollah  Khamene'i's representative in the IRGC; Brigadier General  Mohammad 'Ali Ja'fari, the commander of the IRGC's Ground  Forces; and Brigadier General Amir 'Ali Amiri; head of the IRGC  personnel office.    The participants stress the instrumental role of the IRGC in  defending the country and the revolution during the war with  Iraq, and as well as its important contributions to Iran's  post-war reconstruction and development. This is followed by  interviews with members of the public who pay tribute to the  IRGC and its important services, and ask for more information on  the IRGC's involvement in development projects. In reply,  Brigadier General Safavi enumerates a number of projects, such  as construction of dams and gas pipe- lines.    A relative of a martyr asks what assistance is given to the  families of martyrs. Amiri says that part of the IRGC duties is  to identify all IRGC martyrs, visit their families, and  cooperate with the Martyrs Foundation to help these families.  Zolqadr also talks about a university for sciences which is run  by the IRGC.    Razini is asked about the function of the representative of  the leader in the IRGC. He says that the IRGC came into being  to safeguard the gains of the revolution. The task of the  leader's representative is to make sure that the original  revolutionary spirit is maintained. His other roles are to  ensure the guards' ideological suitability and supervise their  promotion, and to conduct a general supervision of the IRGC to  ensure that all its decisions and regulations are in keeping  with religious norms.    One of the guards asks if any attempts are being made to  write a documentary history of the Iran-Iraq war. Ja'fari says  that some cultural and artistic activities are under way to  safeguard the memory of the gains of the war. Safavi adds that  there is a great deal of audio recording about the events of the  war, as well as about 100,000 pages of records about the history  of the war. These will be useful in future for those who wish  to write the history of the war.    Then there are a number of questions about promotions,  transfers, career development opportunities, and pensions and  benefits for IRGC personnel. Amiri provides detailed answers to  these questions.    At the conclusion of the program, Zolqadr refers to the  IRGC's contribution to the fight against terrorists attempting  to hijack Iranian airplanes. He says: "I only wished to use  this opportunity to mention the efforts of our dear brothers,  the unknown guards who have the very important responsibility of  protecting the aircraft of the country. I must say that during  the period when on the orders of the late imam the IRGC was  given the responsibility of protecting the aircraft of the  country and the flights, 70 plots for aircraft hijacking were  foiled by the dear guards and nothing went wrong during that  period. I should just explain that the last case in which one  of the Oil Ministry's private aircraft was hijacked to Iraq by  the counterrevolutionaries -- that case happened by dint of the  fact that there were no guards on board. The IRGC was not  responsible for that flight, and the aircraft was not guarded by  the IRGC. After that, as a result of the insistence of national  officials, the IRGC was given the responsibility of providing  protection for all flights. It was made responsible for their  protection. I like to thank the brothers for this during these  blessed days."</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: RADIANT HEAT TAKES THE CHILL OFF  </P> <P> QUESTION: Several rooms in my home are too chilly. Will electric radiant  heaters be effective? Are they less expensive to operate than baseboard heating  and other types of electric heaters?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Electric radiant heat is an excellent method for heating and increasing  your comfort in a chilly room. It has been used in Europe for many years to  heat rooms and entire houses.  </P> <P> Electric radiant heat can be very energy-efficient and, with no moving parts,  it is practically maintenance-free. There are many different types of such  heaters available for different applications in your home.  </P> <P> One company even makes a thin radiant heater panel with a picture on it. When  you hang it on your wall, it looks like a decorative picture in a frame. Since  a radiant heater doesn't have to heat the room air in order for you to feel  warm, you feel heat quickly after turning it on. This makes it ideal for  bathrooms and bedrooms.  </P> <P> Although most electric resistance heating is expensive to operate, radiant  heating is more efficient for several reasons. First, you can set your  thermostat lower and still be very comfortable. That can save up to 3% of your  heating costs for each degree you lower your thermostat.  </P> <P> Radiant energy heats objects and people in your rooms, not the room air itself.  The effect is similar to standing in the warm sun on a cold day. The air  temperature stays fairly constant from floor to ceiling, and you don't get the  cool feeling you do with air blowing out from a heat pump.  </P> <P> With electric radiant heat in several rooms in your home, you can easily "zone  heat" your house. Since each room has its own temperature control, you can  easily set it back in rooms you aren't using.  </P> <P> For new construction, electric radiant heaters can be used in several ways.  There are thin flexible sheets that are stapled under the ceiling joists. The  standard gypsum board is then nailed under it.  </P> <P> There are also thin, lightweight radiant panels that mount under the ceiling  for use in existing rooms. You can easily hang them and they can be painted to  match your room.  </P> <P> You can also purchase gypsum board with heating elements embedded inside. You  install these on the ceiling joists just like standard drywall. They are  available with either 110- or 220-volt heating elements.  </P> <P> You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 044 showing a buyer's guide  and list of manufacturers of various types of electric radiant heaters for  existing rooms and new construction. Please include $1 and a self-addressed  business-sized envelope. Send your requests to James Dulley, care of the Los  Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45244.  </P></p>

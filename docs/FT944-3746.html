			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Management: Pioneers and Prophets - Thomas Watson Sr Few business people create companies in their own image which then thrive after their departure. Most plummet after the final farewell from the great leader, unable or unwilling to carry on as before. Thomas Watson Senior (1874-1956), the man behind IBM, is one of the rare exceptions. Under Watson, IBM became the stuff of corporate and stock market legend. Watson created a corporate culture which lasted. IBM - Big Blue - became the archetypal modern corporation and its managers the ultimate stereotype with their regulation sombre suits, zeal for selling and company song. Beneath this, however, lay a belief in competing vigorously and providing quality service. Later, competitors complained that IBM's sheer size won it orders. This was only partly true. Its size masked a deeper commit-ment to managing customer accounts, providing service and building relationships. These elements were established by the demanding perfectionist, Watson. 'He emphasised people and service - obsessively,' noted Tom Peters in Liberation Management. 'IBM was a service star in an era of malperforming machines.' IBM's origins lay in the Computing-Tabulating Recording Company which Watson joined in 1914. Under Watson the company's revenues doubled from Dollars 4.2m (Pounds 2.6m) to Dollars 8.3m by 1917. Initially making everything from butcher's scales to meat slicers, its activities gradually concentrated on tabulating machines which processed information mechanically on punched cards. Watson boldly renamed the company International Business Machines. This was, at the time, overstating the company's credentials, though IBM Japan was established before the second world war. IBM's development was helped by the 1937 Wages-Hours Act which required US companies to record hours worked and wages paid. The existing machines could not cope and Watson instigated work on a solution. In 1944 the Mark 1 was launched, followed by the Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator in 1947. By then IBM's revenues were Dollars 119m and it was set to make the great leap forward to become the world's largest computer company. While Watson Sr created IBM's culture, his son, Thomas Watson Junior (1914-1994) moved it from being an outstanding performer to world dominance. Yet, the strength of the original culture remained intact. Indeed, Watson Jr fleshed it out, creating a framework of theories round the intuitive and hard-nosed business acumen of his father. 'The secret I learned early on from my father was to run scared and never think I had made it,' he said. And, sure enough, when IBM thought it had made it the ground slipped beneath its previously sure feet. In A Business and Its Beliefs, an extended IBM mission statement, Watson Jr tellingly observes: 'The beliefs that mould great organisations frequently grow out of the character, the experience and the convictions of a single person.' In IBM's case that person was Watson Sr.</p>

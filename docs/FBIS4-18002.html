			<p>BFN     [Text] [no dateline as received] "AZATAMART" weekly  published an interview with the Chairman of the State Committee  on defence of the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh Robert Kocharyan.    In Karabakh leader's opinion, one of the obstacles hindering  the settlement of the conflict is the existence of two parallel  initiatives - CSCE's and Russia's - which gives the sides an  opportunity to maneuver. Kocharyan also noted that before  December 1993 there had been contacts with Azerbaijan on the  highest level. However, after the beginning of the latest  Azerbaijani offensive, the official Baku broke up those contacts.    During that two-month large-scale offensive the mediators,  in  Kocharyan's words, made no efforts to influence the attacking  side. Instead, they patiently waited for the results of military  actions.    Touching upon Turkey's and England's position, the Karabakh  leader noted, "The attitude of those countries towards Karabakh  was obvious since the very first days of the conflict. As to  the oil agreements with Azerbaijan, they will only prolong  confrontation". When asked what kind of future he sees for  Karabakh, Kocharyan answered, "Autonomy with the widest range of  rights within a united Armenian state".</p>

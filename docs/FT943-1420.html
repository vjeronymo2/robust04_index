			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Review of building societies' structure starts A far-reaching government review of the way building societies operate, including how they are accountable to the millions of customers who own them, was launched yesterday. The consultation paper published by the Treasury has already re-ignited the debate on how to enable societies to compete effectively in retail financial services without giving them an unfair advantage over other organisations. Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies Association, welcomed the paper. He said: 'Everything is up for grabs except building societies.' As mutual institutions, societies are owned by members rather than being responsible to shareholders. Their critics - including Abbey National, the banking group which used to be a society - say this means boards of directors are not accountable to members in the way boards of public limited companies are. The Treasury raises the prospect of making societies more accountable through setting up consultative committees of members or requiring societies to reserve some board places for candidates nominated by 'ordinary members'. Among the subsidiary questions is whether societies should be able to vary the existing voting system which gives members one vote each - for example to take account of the amount of their business. In terms of streamlining societies' powers, the suggestions in the Treasury paper include: Changing from a prescriptive regime to one where societies can undertake any business, subject to a principal purpose and certain limits on their asset structure. Adopting a two-track approach in which some, probably small, societies continue under a restrictive system, but others could seek agreement to operate within a more relaxed framework. Giving societies access to the banking sector by letting them own banking subsidiaries, or by allowing them to convert into mutual banks. The paper makes it clear the government does not intend to look again at the statutory controls that make a hostile takeover of a society impossible, but it does consider some liberalisation of the rules for mergers between societies. Building societies generally welcomed the discussion paper, although Halifax, the UK's largest mortgage lender, said the relatively slow pace of progress on questions of giving the sector greater powers was 'disappointing'. Societies rejected the idea that there might be a shortfall in their answerability to their owners, and they expressed misgivings about the two specific proposals for enhancing their accountability. Halifax described these proposals as 'a solution in search of a problem', and other societies criticised the idea of a consultative committee as unworkable and bureaucratic. However Mr Peter Robinson, managing director of Woolwich, the third largest society, acknowledged there was a need for an 'attitudinal change' among societies which should be readier to help ordinary members who showed interest in standing for election as directors. Mr Peter Birch, Abbey National chief executive, dismissed the paper's accountability proposals. Among his suggestions was that customers should get an annual statement making it clear whether they were members and telling them the value of their membership. The Treasury intends to complete the review by the end of the year, and has asked for comments by November 9. Review Of The Building Societies Act 1986.

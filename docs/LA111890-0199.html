			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BENNETT TO SUCCEED ATWATER, SOURCES SAY  </P> <P> President Bush has asked former drug czar William J. Bennett to take over Lee  Atwater's job as chairman of the Republican Party in January and Bennett has  accepted, GOP sources said Saturday.  </P> <P> Bennett, a former secretary of education in Ronald Reagan's Cabinet, formally  resigned Nov. 8 as head of the Office of National Drug Control Strategy.  </P> <P> A GOP source said Atwater, who managed Bush's 1988 presidential campaign, will  continue to play a major strategy role for the GOP, possibly with a title as  the party's "general chairman."  </P> <P> Such a structure would not be unique, the source said, citing Frank J.  Fahrenkopf Jr.'s chairmanship of the Republican National Committee in the 1980s  while then-Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.) held the title as the party's general  chairman.  </P> <P> A formal announcement will not be made until Bush returns from his eight-day  trip to Czechoslovakia, Germany, France, Egypt and the Persian Gulf, said the  source, speaking on the condition of anonymity.  </P> <P> Atwater, 39, has been undergoing intensive treatment for cancer since a tumor  was discovered on the right side of his brain last March. His two-year term as  GOP chairman expires in January.  </P> <P> B. J. Cooper, a Republican Party spokesman, said that Bennett "is on a short  list of people being considered" to succeed Atwater "but there's been no formal  announcement at this time."  </P> <P> Cooper said Bush's choice for a new Republican chairman would have to be  ratified by the party's national committee in January.  </P> <P> Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown, meeting with his party's $100,000  donors in Atlanta, said he welcomes Bennett's appointment as his chief  adversary with "open arms."  </P> <P> "If Bennett accomplishes as much for the Republican Party as he achieved at the  Education Department and in ridding us of drugs and violence, Americans will  have to begin worrying about the future of the two-party system," Brown  quipped.  </P> <P> Atwater has been more of a tactician than an ideologue. After GOP candidates  lost to abortion-rights Democrats in two high-profile governors races in 1989,  he acted quickly to move the Republican Party away from its hard-line  opposition to abortion.  </P> <P> But he also has what Democrats denounced as a "pit bull style of politics,"  citing his use of "Willie Horton" ads against Democratic presidential nominee  Michael S. Dukakis in 1988.  </P> <P> Horton is a convicted murderer who raped a woman in Maryland during a furlough  from a Massachusetts prison while Dukakis was the state's governor.  </P> <P> Bennett, 47, also has a reputation for confrontation and brashness. Two weeks  ago when Bush accepted his resignation, Bennett called Rep. Charles B. Rangel  (D-N.Y.), a frequent critic of his drug policies, "a gasbag."  </P></p>

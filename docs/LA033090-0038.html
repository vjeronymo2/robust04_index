			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BRASWELL MOVES UP ONE NOTCH  </P> <P> Cal State Long Beach assistant basketball Coach Bob Braswell spent Thursday  morning on a jet traveling to Denver where he will attend the NCAA Final Four  festivities.  </P> <P> As if he needed a plane.  </P> <P> One year after leaving the high school ranks, Braswell has moved a step closer  to fulfilling his goal of becoming a Division I head coach. Braswell, who  coached at Cleveland High from 1985-1989 and twice led the team to the City  Section 4-A Division final, has been named the No. 1 assistant at Cal State  Long Beach.  </P> <P> "I'm pretty pumped up about it," Braswell said.  </P> <P> Braswell, 28, who spent last season as the No. 2 assistant at Long Beach, was  promoted when Coach Joe Harrington accepted a position at Colorado. Seth  Greenberg, 33, Harrington's right-hand man and chief assistant the past three  seasons, was named Thursday to replace Harrington.  </P> <P> Braswell assumes Greenberg's duties as chief recruiter and scouting  coordinator.  </P> <P> "It's exciting. I never would have expected to make the jump from Cleveland to  where I am now this fast," Braswell said by telephone from Denver. "I've really  learned a lot about basketball over the last year, on and off the court."  </P> <P> Greenberg said he feels fortunate that he and Braswell will continue to work  together.  </P> <P> "I'm elated to have him staying with the program," Greenberg said. "Especially  because he's such a great teacher."  </P> <P> Harrington, 44, said he will recruit another staff at Colorado and that he  accepted the position with the understanding that Greenberg and Braswell would  be allowed to fill his shoes at Long Beach. Harrington said he did not consider  bringing the pair with him.  </P> <P> "Staying would be the best thing for (Braswell) professionally," said  Harrington, who also is in Denver. "He needs to remain there and continue to  develop as a college coach, because he can definitely become one."  </P></p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: Merck surges 20% on improved sales STRONG SALES of its most recent drugs helped Merck, the US pharmaceuticals company, to post a 20 per cent improvement in first-quarter earnings, on sales that rose 17 per cent. The company had net income of Dollars 483.5m, or Dollars 1.25 a share, in the three months ended March 31, compared with Dollars 403.8m, or Dollars 1.03, a year earlier. Sales were Dollars 2.05bn, against Dollars 1.76bn. Mr Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive, attributed the improved earnings to strong unit volume gains, better product mix, cost controls, productivity improvements and a lower tax rate. Sales and earnings were also helped by a favourable exchange rate, which lifted sales in the quarter by 3 percentage points. Sales outside the US accounted for 45 per cent of the first-quarter total, the same proportion as the previous year. On Wall Street, Merck's results underlined the relative safety of the drug sector, and its shares added Dollars 1 to Dollars 110 3/4 at mid-session yesterday, just shy of their 52-week high of Dollars 110 7/8 . During the 1980s, Merck paced the industry in introducing new drugs, and its first-quarter results reflected the strong sales of a range including Mevacor, Vasotec, Zocor, Prinivil and Vaseretic. Merck said yesterday it had filed a new drug application with the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) for its Proscar drug to treat benign prostate enlargement. The condition afflicts about 60 per cent of all men over 50. The drug could bring in annual sales of Dollars 1bn by the end of the decade. American Home Products, another big US drugs company, also reported improved first-quarter earnings and underlying sales yesterday. The company, which sold its household products and depilatory businesses last June, had net income of Dollars 352.5m, or Dollars 1.12, compared with Dollars 314.5m, or Dollars 1 a share, a year ago. Net sales slid 3 per cent to Dollars 1.76bn from Dollars 1.81bn. However, after stripping out discontinued businesses, sales rose by Dollars 133.2m, or 8 per cent, in the 1991 quarter.</p>

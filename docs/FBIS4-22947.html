Kulikov, of the Institute of the  Ecology of Plants and Animals of the Urals Division of the  Russian Academy of Sciences; UDC 574:539.163+621.039.7]    [Text] The accumulation of [.sup]134+137[/]Cs and [.sup]90[/]  Sr by the catkins and leaves of the European birch  was studied in three pine and birch stands located 1.5, 6, and  18 km from the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station. A change is  demonstrated in the concentration of these radionuclides in the  structural elements of the catkins and in the leaves in various  years, and a quantitative characterization is given of the shift  of radionuclides out of the soil into the generative organs and  leaves.    It has been established that with aerial contamination of  forest stands by radioactive substances, up to 40-50% of  these  are retained by the crowns of the trees (Tikhomirov, et al.,  1972; Naryshkin, et al., 1973; Aleksakhin and Naryshkin, 1973).  At the same time, the structural elements of the crown play a  disparate role in the circulation of radionuclides in forest  biogeocenoses. Although among the annually deciduous parts of  the crowns the leaves play the leading part in this process, it  is necessary to take into account the contribution of the  generative organs, the weight of which in some trees (for  example, the willow and the birch) is quite high in the years of  abundant fruit bearing. There are only brief reports in the  literature on the content of radiocesium and radiostrontium in  the crowns of birch growing in the environs of the CNPS  (Yushkov, et al., 1990).    Data on the accumulation of [.sup]134+137[/]Cs and [.sup]90[/]   Sr by the generative organs and leaves of the  European birch (Betula verrucosa Ehrh.) within the  30-kilometer zone of the CNPS over the course of the first three  years after the accident are presented in this paper.    In the first year of the investigation, 15-20 of the most  abundantly fruit-bearing young, primarily 25-35 year old birch  trees were selected in each of three pine and birch stands (Fig.  1) located at a distance of 1.5 (Yanov settlement), 6 (Kopachi  village), and 18 km (Bolshoy Cherevach village) from the  destroyed block of the NPS; from these the catkins were  collected in August 1987, 1988, and 1989, and the leaves as well  in the following two years. The _g_-radiation dose rate in the  first section was 20-40, in the second 3.0, and in the third  0.3-0.6 mR/h.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-94A>      Diagram of the location of sampling areas (1, 2, 3) in forest stands of the 30-kilometer zone of the </FIG>     The concentration of the radionuclides in the structural  elements of the catkins (seeds, wings, and fruit scales) as well  as of the leaves was determined individually for each tree. To  assess the influence of an increased radiation level on the  catkins, the weight of their structural elements, the seeds,  wings, and fruit scales was measured.    Soil profiles were cut in 1987 and 1988 in the sections  close  to Kopachi and Bolshoy Cherevach villages, and soil samples were  taken. The soil cover on the forest sections examined was  represented by weakly turfed and humus-enriched sands (pH of the  aqueous extract was 4.5-5.2;the content of exchangeable Ca,  1.20-4.09; Mg, 0.33-1.48; K, 0.15-0.36 mg-equ./100 g of soil). A  more detailed soil and radioecological description of the  sections was given in preceding papers (Molchanova, et al.,  1990, 1991).    The radiocesium content was determined in multichannel  AMA-02F1 analyzers with semiconductor detectors of the DGDK-50-B  and DGDK-63A-3 types. The data on the content of [.sup]134[/]Cs  and [.sup]137[/]Cs are presented summarily for both  radionuclides. The [.sup]90[/]Sr concentration was measured  radiochemically on the basis of the daughter [.sup]90[/]Y, the  radiometry of which was carried out on a low-background UMF-1500  unit with an SBT-13 end-window counter tube having a counting  error not greater than 15%.    A visual examination was made at the end of July, 1987, of  selected trees which did not reveal any significant changes in  the structure of the crowns. However, in some trees in the  stands located close to the NPS, up to 10-15% of the  catkins  were found with a split tip, and the absence of chlorophyll was  observed in the peripheral parts of the leaf blade. In  1987-1989, the weight of the seeds and the fruit scales in the  birch in all of the stands examined were. respectively, 41-45  and 52-59%, and of the wings, 3-5% of the total  weight of the  catkins (table 1). This suggests the absence of an influence of  the elevated radiation background on the ratio of the weights of  the individual structural elements of the catkins in these  stands and, consequently, on the distribution of the  radionuclides in the crown of the trees.

Thus, it was 113 kBq/kg of  air-dried weight in the seeds from the first stand (15 km from  the NPS), and respectively 1.5 and 4.5 times less from the  second and third stands (6 and 18 km from the NPS). At the same  time, the concentration of radiocesium in the wings and seeds in  all the stands examined was lower than in the fruit scales. In  1988 the concentration of this radionuclide increased sharply as  compared with the preceding year in the seeds and the fruit  scales in birch in the first stand, while it remained  substantially unchanged in the other two. In 1989 the content  of radiocesium was determined in the seeds and leaves, while in  the trees of the stand that was most remote from the NPS, due to  the nonharvesting of the seeds, only in the leaves. The  concentration of [.sup]137[/]Cs in both organs increased in all  stands as compared with the preceding year, and especially  strongly in the section close to the nuclear station  (respectively 1.5-and 4.5-fold).   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-95A>      Fig. 2. Content of [.sup]134+137[/]Cs in </FIG>     Calculations showed that on the average 70% of the  radioactive cesium contained in the catkin is in the fruit  scales and approximately 25% is in the seeds (table 2).  Such a  distribution of radionuclides in the European Birch catkins is  determined by the higher proportion of the weight of the fruit  scales in the weight of the catkin and by their greater  accumulative capacity in relation to radiocesium as compared  with the seeds and wings.

The content of [.sup]90[/]Sr, as of radioactive cesium, in  the structural elements of the birch catkins and leaves  decreases as the distance from the destroyed block of the NPS  increases (fig. 3). Thus, in the first stand (Yanov settlement)  the content of radionuclides in the seeds of the 1987 harvest  calculated per 1 kg of air-dried weight was 120 kBq; in the  second and third stands, it was 4.8 and 17.1 times less,  respectively. A fairly small increase is observed in 1988 in the  concentration of radiostrontium in the leaves from the trees  from the first and second stands; however, this is statistically  insignificant. The concentration of [.sup]90[/]Sr in the  catkins and leaves increases sharply in 1989 in trees from the  first stand by contrast with trees from the second stand. The  average concentration of [.sup]90[/]Sr in the leaves and seeds  was identical, but the coefficient of correlation between these  organs with respect to this feature was very low (r = 7.1).   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-96A>      Fig. 3. Content of [.sup]90[/]Sr in the crowns of European birch trees growing at various distances from </FIG>     Within the limits of the catkin, the concentration of [.sup]90[/]   Sr in the seeds was higher as a rule than in the  fruit scales. However, these differences were statistically  significant only in the catkins of the 1989 harvest from the  stand located close to the NPS (t = 4.0 when t[.sub]0.05[/] =  2.3). In all the stands about 50% of the total amount of  radiostrontium in the catkin is in the leaves.    Significant differences were observed between the trees  within the limits of each of the stands examined with respect to  the radiostrontium in the catkins and the leaves: the  coefficient of variation with respect to this feature ranged  from 26 to 98%.    The ratio of the [.sup]134+137[/]Cs in the structural  elements of the catkins and leaves in the first three years  after the accident is mainly in the range of 0.10-0.51 (table  3), which is close to the ratio of these radionuclides in the  soil, 0.18-0.42 (table 4). It proved to be very low (0.01-0.04)  in the seeds and the fruit scales of the trees from the stand  close to village of B. Cherevach.       Table 3.

The comparison of the data on the concentration of the  radionuclides in soils (table 4) and in the birch crown (figs.  2, 3). It can be seen from table 4 that the concentration of [.sup]90[/]   Sr and [.sup]134+137[/]Cs in the soils from  sections close to Kopachi village in 1987 and 1988 is 7-17 and  15-17 higher than in soils near B. Cherevach village. The  content of [.sup]90[/]Sr in the crowns (catkins and leaves) is  40 times higher, while that of [.sup]137[/]Cs is only 3 times  higher in the trees in the first of these sections. Thus, the  differences with respect to the average concentration of the  radionuclides in the crowns of trees growing in different stands  are disproportional to those in the soil.    The results of the investigations presented above suggest  that in the first three years after the accident at the CNPS,  the ecologically nonuniform state of the circulation of  strontium and cesium is characteristic for the forest  biogeocenoses examined. This is expressed in the increase over  this period of their concentration in the catkins and leaves and  in the presence of a substantial disproportion in the content of  the radionuclides in the plants and the soil from different  stands. This radioecological situation is determined by the  relatively short period that has passed following the accident  at the CNPS in 1986, as well as by the repeated aerial  contamination of forest stands in 1987 and 1988 that was  associated with the occurrence of dust storms during the  carrying out of repair operations at the NPS and the  deactivation of the territory around it (Blagoev, et al., 1991),  and with a change in the accessibility of radionuclides for  woody plants. It should be noted that a decline in [.sup]134[/]  Cs, due to its radioactive decay (the half-life of [.sup]134[/]  Cs is 2.08 years), as compared with 1987 in the  trees and soils, was reflected in the absolute values of the  concentration of [.sup]134+137[/]Cs in catkins and leaves of  the collections of 1988 and 1989.    The forest stands of the 30-kilometer zone of the accident  were subjected over the course of 1986-1988 to aerial  contamination by radioactive substances. If this was associated  in 1986 mainly with fallout of radionuclides emitted into the  air from the destroyed reactor, in 1987-1988, as was noted  above, it was associated with repeated aeolian transport of  dust. In the year of the accident, the extra-root pathway of the  entry of [.sup]90[/]Sr and [.sup]134+137[/]Cs into the birch  trees predominated over the root pathway. It is evident that  during the time following the accident, the contribution of root  entry increased. However, to assess quantitatively the  contribution of each of the two pathways to the radioactivity of  the birch catkins and leaves in the first years following the  accident, a contribution that depends on many factors, does not  seem possible. The intensification of root entry of  radionuclides into the trees is governed by the vertical  migration of radioactive substances along the soil profile and  by the increase in the area of contact of the suctorial ends of  the roots with the contaminated soil (Aleksakhin and Naryshkin,  1977). Repeated aerial contamination of forest stands with  radioactive dust can retard the processes of stabilization of  the redistribution of radionuclides between components of  biogeocenoses, the approximate periods of which under  experimental conditions reach 10-12 years (Tikhomirov, et al.,  1973; Aleksakhin and Naryshkin, 1977).    Our experiments have shown that the generative organs  (catkins) of the birch accumulate radiostrontium and radiocesium  in concentrations close to those in the leaves, and,  consequently, represent an important element in the circulation  of these radionuclides in forest biogeocenoses in the harvest  years. The substantial differences between the trees within the  limits of each of the stands examined with respect to the  concentration of radionuclides in the catkins and leaves reflect  the high degree of nonuniformity of the contamination of forest  sections brought about by the accident at the CNPS and repeated  aerial transport of emitters with dust.

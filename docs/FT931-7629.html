			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei loses ground amid worries on export outlook A SURGE in the yen triggered fears over lower profits at leading exporters and, as the dollar fell to an all-time low, the Nikkei average lost ground on selling of export-oriented stocks, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei closed down 189.42 at the day's low of 16,820.61. The index peaked at 17,058.59 on index-linked buying during the morning session, but subsided as the dollar fell below Y117. Volume fell to 200m shares against 221m. Losers led gainers by 687 to 236 with 200 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks lost 10.15 to 1,283.91 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.56 to 1,204.90. The dollar finally closed at Y116.85 against the yen, Y2.38 down since last Friday. Comments by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, that a higher yen was desirable added fuel to buying of the yen, which has been active during the past two weeks on speculation that the Group of Seven finance ministers will agree on a concerted move to revalue the Japanese currency. Mr Robert Feldman, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said that the yen's rise would have a neutral effect on the economy, and predicted that it would move to the Y115 level. Among leading exporters, Toshiba fell Y15 to Y560 and NEC Y22 to Y610. Toyota Motor lost Y30 to Y1,340 and Honda Motor Y20 to Y1,270. However, electric utilities, beneficiaries of a higher yen due to their dependency on oil imports, gained ground. Tokyo Electric Power advanced Y20 to Y2,590 and Chubu Electric Power rose Y60 to Y2,490. Showa Shell Sekiyu, an affiliate of Royal Dutch Shell, came under heavy selling after its announcement of a Y125bn loss stemming from a failure in foreign exchange. The issue failed to trade due to the lack of buyers and closed at an offered price of Y1,200, down by its daily limit of Y300. Foreign and domestic investors bought Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which rose Y10,000 to Y619,000 on hopes that the company will put its rates up. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 92.25 to 18,293.29 in volume of 70.3m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y300 to Y10,100 on fears of lower profits due to the higher yen. Roundup POLITICAL considerations held the key to trading in a number of Pacific Rim markets. HONG KONG benefited from reports of progress towards new Sino-British talks on the colony's plans for political reform and the Hang Seng index rose 61.79 to 6,231.88. Turnover, however, was only HKDollars 2.9bn, well below last week's robust daily average of nearly HKDollars 4bn. Trading was dominated by the debut of the so-called 'China-concept' share Denway Investment. Denway, issued at HKDollars 1.22, rose to HKDollars 2.70 in early trade before slipping back to close at HKDollars 2.20, well below market expectations. Jardine Matheson, a laggard since a thinly veiled attack on the company by China's official media in December, continued a week-long rally to finish up HKDollars 1.75 at HKDollars 51. AUSTRALIAN shares closed near their highs as the futures market inspired solid gains. The All Ordinaries index closed 10.2 higher at 1,604.9 in turnover of ADollars 306.36m. Encouraging results and growing signs that the coalition will win the federal election helped lift the mood. Pancontinental Mining was heavily traded as Degussa, the German chemical group, sold its stake for ADollars 21.1m. The shares finished 2 cents lower at 95 cents. SINGAPORE was mostly firm ahead of this Friday's national budget with trade driven by Malaysian speculative issues. The Straits Times Industrial index was 0.83 ahead at 1,639.87 in volume of 139.52m shares. KUALA LUMPUR closed higher on strong speculative buying that took the composite index 6.16 higher to 635.59. Dunlop Estates rose 95 cents to MDollars 7.80, Magnum added 70 cents to MDollars 10.40 and Multi-Purpose gained 26 cents to MDollars 2.44. TAIWAN saw sharp advances among financials shares amid expectations that the big three banks would issue big stock dividends next fiscal year. The weighted index finished 42.79 ahead at a six-month high of 4,098.44. Turnover rose to TDollars 61.5bn, the heaviest since last June. SEOUL got active institutional support ahead of Thursday's presidential inauguration and the composite index rose 22.64 to 674.71. BANGKOK fell in thin trade, worried about the outlook for finance companies after First City Investment told the government last week it had run out of cash to repay debts, and was being investigated by authorities. The SET index dropped 17.18 to 945.62. BOMBAY trod water ahead of Saturday's national budget but there was selective buying, and the BSE index closed 36.97 higher at 2,708.34.</p>

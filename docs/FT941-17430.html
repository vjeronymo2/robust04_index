			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / New UK Share Classification: New All-Share sectors reflect changes in UK economy When today's stock market results are totted up at the end of trading, they will be reported for the first time under the revised FT-SE Actuaries classification, write Peter Martin and Adrian Dicks. The traditional All-Share categories have been given their first thorough overhaul in two decades, to yield sectors that more accurately reflect the shape of today's market. Sectors have been merged or subdivided as their relative importance has changed. And the former Miscellaneous stocks have been given proper homes of their own. The new classification system is of special interest to FT readers, because it shapes the layout of the paper's share price listings, the London Share Service. As a result of the changes, to be implemented in tomorrow's edition, several hundred of the 3,000 or so securities quoted on the pages will change sectors. To ease the transition, today's FT provides a full alphabetical listing of shares carried in the London Share Service. Readers may wish to keep it for reference, so as to find their way easily around the pages. Today's listings, reporting Friday's dealings, are the last in the old form. From tomorrow, there is one particular change worth noting. Foreign stocks which are not part of the main classification - those categorised as Americans, Canadians, etc - will be moved from the beginning of the classification scheme to the end. The normal daily table reporting All-Share and other FT-SE Actuaries indices has been reprinted here just as it appeared in Saturday's edition, showing the performance of sectors on the last day of the year under the old classification system. Alongside it is a version showing how that data would have looked if the new classification system had been in operation. The usual end-year tables which show the market capitalisation of each sector will be published in a few days' time. We regret any inconvenience caused to readers by the change of sectors, and hope that it will be short-lived as the new structure becomes familiar. Though we believe that the service to readers is improved, we are conscious that disruption to long-established habits brings its own costs. After this burst of activity, we hope for a period of greater stability. Change of name The reclassification of the All-Share sectors provides an opportunity for a change of name. From now on, the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index will be called the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share Index. This reflects the fact that the All-Share has been part of the FT-SE Actuaries series of indices since 1992. The series is sponsored by the Financial Times, the London Stock Exchange, the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries. Since the last review of the SE and FT-A systems in 1970, the UK's industrial base has evolved considerably, reflecting both the growth of the service industries and the Government's privatisation programme for utilities. In contrast, basic industries and capital goods manufacturers in the UK have suffered a relative decline. The FT-SE Actuaries Industry Classification System has three tiers: Economic groups. The non-financial groups will be replaced by the following range of industrial groups: Mineral Extraction, General Manufacturers, Consumer Goods, Services, Utilities, Financials and Investment Trusts (Note: Capital Goods, Consumer Group, Other Groups and Oil &amp; Gas have all been replaced). Industry sectors. The old FT-A industry sectors have been revised to fit into the new economic groupings. This has resulted in the creation of new sector descriptions, some being merged and larger sectors further sub-divided. Examples are: Electricals and Electronics, which are merged; Engineering General and Engineering Aerospace, also merged. Oil &amp; Gas is sub-divided into Gas Distribution, Oil Integrated and Oil Exploration &amp; Production; Health &amp; Household is sub-divided into Pharmaceuticals, Household Goods and Health Care. The new industry sectors created include Extractive Industries and Distributors. Several others have been renamed. Sub-sectors. The old Stock Exchange sectors have been reviewed and integrated within the industry sectors. Where appropriate, sub-sectors have been defined to provide homogenous industry groupings, eg Extractive Industries into Gold Mining, Other Mines and Mining Finance. Each company has been allocated to the industry sub-sector whose definition most closely describes the nature of its business. The primary consideration when classifying companies is the proportion of profits arising from each industry area. In order to maintain stability in the classification system, temporary fluctuations in the profitability of individual classes of business are generally disregarded. Classifications are normally determined using the annual audited accounts of the company. Where a company carries on two or more different classes of business, the audited segmentation of profits is used.

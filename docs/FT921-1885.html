			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Arts: Brussels sprouts new music - Dusapin's Medeamaterial at Ars Musica 92 BRUSSELS in March may not be quite as unprepossessing as Huddersfield in November, but it still seems an unlikely location for what has become one of Europe's most significant festivals of contemporary music. In terms of scale and enterprise Ars Musica now rivals Strasbourg, Donaueschingen and the Venice Biennale, and if it still remains scarcely known by the British that cannot be because of its neglect of British music - James Dillon was a featured composer last year, Ferneyhough is strongly represented this, while Jonathan Harvey's works have been included in each of the four festivals so far. Though centred on Brussels, events take place in Liege as well, utilising the resources of the conservatories and of Belgian Radio, together with an impressive roster of visiting ensembles. Ars Musica 92 runs from March 9 to April 2 and carries the title of La Voix du geste; this time Charleroi/Danses and the Plan K visual arts events have been brought under the same festival umbrella, and the involvement of the Theatre de la Monnaie's with its new double bill of Dusapine and Purcell adds yet a further strand. There are retrospectives this year of Kagel, Kurtag and Nono, but the most important premieres belong to younger generations, and to Pascal Dusapin especially. This weekend his huge 'operatorio' La Melancholia will be heard in Brussels after its premiere in Paris. Together with the Monnaie's staging of his opera after Heiner Muller, Medeamaterial, it bring Dusapin's development right up to date. In Britain we know the music of Dusapin (born in 1955) from a handful of performances, chiefly by Richard Bernas and Music Projects. His larger-scale pieces, including an opera Romeo et Juliette, premiered in Strasburg in 1988, remain unexplored here. Yet as one of the leading lights of a talented generation of French composers, and one of the very few pupils of Iannis Xenakis, he amply deserves further exposure. The new opera, roughly an hour long, is a fascinating, sustained piece of theatre. Medeamaterial is a short prose text by Muller, part of his trilogy about the Jason and Medea myths. It is essentially a monologue built around Medea's final moments, ending with the murder of her sons and her own suicide. Dusapin confines the brief contributions of the Nurse and her husband Jason to off-stage pre-recorded voices, and concentrates musical attention upon Medea. In this stage version directed by Jacques Delcuvellerie with designs by Johan Deanen, she has an onstage double, a silent actress, as if a modern-day Medea summons the shade of her classical antecedent to articulate her own despair while she writhes around the stage her soprano alter ego delivers the monologue. It is a tour de force for the singer, the compelling Hilde Leidland, and for Dusapin, who paces it wonderfully, extends some beautifully judged vocal lines, and underpins them with the most telling discreet orchestral textures. There are brief instrumental interludes, strange otherworldly, vaguely Moorish dances in which the quartet who seem part of the contemporary Medea's entourage circle and menace her shade, but otherwise the piece moves on a smooth musical curve that seems almost self-contained. The Dusapin was commissioned by the Monnaie specifically to be coupled with Dido and Aeneas, making up a double bill of operas about tragic Classical heroines. So Dusapin's imaginative scoring uses the same period-instrument band, the Orchestre de la Chapelle Royale from Paris, conducted by Philippe Herreweghe, and the same chorus in the pit, the Collegium Vocale of Ghent, as well as a staging very obviously twinned with that concoted by Delcuvellerie for Dido. But whereas the Medea story was projected into the present, Dido and Aeneas kept its period trappings, with much use of frames within frames  - proscenium arches replicating themselves upstage, a bank of television screens endlessly reproducing images of breaking waves, guttering candles, falling rose petals - and a good deal of camp stage business. The central performances were strong and sensible, especially Marianne Rorholm's cool and secure Dido, and Donna Brown's elegant Belinda: but Ralf Popken's Sorceress was miles over the top and he/she was abetted by two witches (Michele Patzakis, Zofia Kilanowicz) with Dolly Parton-style cleavages (false, one assumes) and accents to match. It was the Dusapin, though, that one remembered, for its consistency and confident pacing, much more than for its mise en scene. A much less ambitious piece of Dusapin, Stanze for brass quintet, opened a concert last Saturday evening by the Ensemble Intercontemporain under Ingo Metzmacher in the magnificent concert hall of Belgian Radio's old headquarters. Their programme also included Magnus Lindberg's Joy, which the London Sinfonietta brought to the Queen Elizabeth Hall two months ago, and Barraque piece somewhere in its programme, and Temps restitue remains the most arcane and rarely heard of his half dozen completed pieces. Like all of Barraque's works based upon Hermann Broch's impenetrable novel The Death of Virgil, it had a protracted gestation, first completed in the late 1950s and reaching final form ten year later. In performance now it seems costive, highly wrought and rather brittle. There is the high dramatic density that is so thrilling in all Barraque's scores: the sence of extreme emotion forced into tight structured paragraphs, the extravagantly lyrical vocal lines, the explosive writing for percussion. But here it was abrupt and never convincingly sustained, coming across as certainly the most problematic of Barraque's works, and the first to make one doubt his special stature that has been taken on trust for so long.</p>

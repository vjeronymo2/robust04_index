			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Trade gap may be start of recovery BRITAIN'S current account deficit widened last month, a sign that the country's battered economy may soon begin a recovery. The increase in the deficit, from Pounds 227m in February to Pounds 432m in March, was announced yesterday by the Central Statistical Office. It was caused largely by a 3 per cent increase in imports between February and March, indicating renewed economic activity by Britain's consumers and industrial groups. Political opponents of the government seized on the increase in imports, to Pounds 9.4bn last month, as signalling a structural weakness in the economy, which may lead to a rapid growth in the import bill once demand improves. According to this argument, Britain suffers from a lack of ability to meet home demand by increasing domestic output rather than by buying goods from overseas. Mr Alex Carlile, the Liberal Democrats' trade and industry spokesman, said: 'After 12 years of Conservative economic policy, the fact that we still cannot export more than we import ought to be worrying the government.' The Labour party said the higher imports were linked to a weakening in Britain's industrial capacity. Last year, Britain cut its current account deficit to Pounds 12.8bn, from Pounds 19.9bn in 1989, as the recession scaled back demand for overseas goods. However, the pace of the improvement is clearly slowing. The measure favoured by government statisticians as showing the underlying trend - the value of visible trade, not counting oil and erratic items such as aircraft, ships and gems - barely altered last month. The deficit on this basis was Pounds 1.1bn in March, the same as in February, and is the smallest number for four years. The comparable figure in January was Pounds 1.2bn. In terms of quarter-on-quarter statistics, the underlying deficit declined by 7 per cent during the first three months of this year, compared to the fourth quarter of 1990. Between the third and fourth quarters of 1990 the fall was 22 per cent. Mr Peter Spencer, chief UK economist at Shearson Lehman, a US-owned investment house, said the trade figures were 'very disappointing, given the weakness in the economy'. Details, Page 10</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Varta may pass dividend Varta, the German battery manufacturer, may omit its dividend this year, Mr Erhard Schipporeit, chairman, warned yesterday. The company is also considering plant closures but no decisions have been made. The company, which paid a DM10 dividend last year, blamed increased competition, industry-wide overcapacity and currency upheavals for a 'considerable fall in profits'. Markets had already been warned of a reduced payout after Varta announced a 75 per cent decline in net earnings to DM5m (Dollars 2.9m) for the first six months of 1993. Turnover had fallen 8 per cent to DM1.56bn in the nine months to end-September, Mr Schipporeit said. The group had reduced its workforce by 6 per cent in the period to less than 14,000 and the cuts would continue next year, he added. Earlier this year Varta announced plans to reduce vehicle starter battery capacity.</p>

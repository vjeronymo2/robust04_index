			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> NEW ENVIRONMENTAL CHIEF SETTLES IN WELL  </P> <P> As the city's new "environmental administrator," deals with chemicals that have  names 18 letters long. But in his first weeks on the job, he seems to have made  progress in dealing with a far more intricate situation: Irvine politics.  </P> <P> In fact, in his first few weeks on the job, he has managed to find favor with  at least two of the city's primary political forces -- no easy task in a city  with an upcoming election.  </P> <P> Irvine Mayor Larry Agran, who championed passage of the city's new ordinance  banning chloroflurocarbons, said he is impressed with Brown's record of  scholarship and publication.  </P> <P> "He's sure to put us in the lead as far as air quality and water quality,"  Agran predicted.  </P> <P> Sally Anne Sheridan, Agran's opponent in the mayoral election, said she voted  against the ordinance because it seemed to be hastily implemented. But of  Brown, she said: "He's terribly qualified . . . the program is one of educating  the community. I think that's the role I see him in."  </P> <P> But Brown, 37, talks about using diplomacy rather than politics to convince  business leaders that complying with the new law does not necessarily mean  losing money or complicating their lives.  </P> <P> "I'm not interested in being perceived as someone who walks around with a  baseball bat," he said.  </P> <P> The city passed the ordinance last year, affecting businesses that use or  produce CFCs, Halon or other substances that are believed to contribute to the  depletion of the earth's ozone layer. The ordinance covers the electronics  industry, installers of insulation and the manufacturers of fast-food  packaging. It is considered one of the most sweeping ordinances of its kind in  the nation.  </P> <P> At the time it passed, Brown was working in Massachusetts in the office of Safe  Waste Management. Peter O'Neil, the director of information at the Department  of Environmental Management in Boston, said that Brown bucked the theory that  says environmental issues and business interests never coincide.  </P> <P> "Michael has helped businesses to stay in business, be productive and not  pollute the environment," O'Neil said. He cited Brown's work at Robbins Co.  Inc., an Attleboro, Mass., jewelry firm that reduced its chemical use by 82%  and its use of water from 500,000 gallons per week to 500.  </P> <P> As he tried to settle into an office decorated with two plastic plants and an  old flyer warning about the dangers of toxic waste, Brown described his new job  as a continuation of his old one -- helping businesses make pollution laws  work.  </P> <P> "I think the ordinance is very important because it says to the people of  Irvine, of the nation and, indeed, the world: 'Look, we don't have to wait on  this issue,' " he said. "I think this ordinance will show that the business  community in Irvine can get a head-start on what's inevitable . . . I think  everyone knows CFCs are going to disappear from commerce."  </P> <P> Brown holds a master's degree and a doctorate from Cornell and a degree in  politics from UC Santa Cruz.  </P> <P> He plans to conduct workshops, to tour plants and provide information to  businesses for now. When the ordinance goes into effect in July, Brown plans to  enforce it.  </P> <P> "Somebody has to be first," Brown said. "I think we can show it can be done."  DANICA KIRKA  </P></p>

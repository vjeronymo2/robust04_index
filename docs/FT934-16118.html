			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Rights abuses 'still continue in Burma' BURMA's military rulers continue to commit grave human rights abuses against the Burmese people, despite some recent improvements, a report by the human rights group Amnesty International says today. More than 1,700 political prisoners have been released by the State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc) since April 1992. But many others are believed still to be languishing in jail either without trial or after unfair hearings, Amnesty says. Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, the pro-democracy leader and Nobel peace prize winner, is enduring her fifth year of house arrest in Rangoon. Even those who have been released are not secure. The Slorc uses the Military Intelligence Services to intimidate and harass real or imagined government critics after they have been freed, the human rights group says. Amnesty also highlights the plight of members of ethnic minorities. They are routinely seized in their villages and fields by soldiers, accused of supporting guerrilla insurgents and beaten or forced to work as porters. 'Despite some positive steps taken by the Slorc, including the abolition of military tribunals, to respond to international criticism of its human rights record, the human rights situation in Myanmar (Burma) is still grim and needs urgent attention,' Amnesty says.</p>

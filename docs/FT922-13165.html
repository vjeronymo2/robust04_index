			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Union to ballot Tube staff LEADERS OF RMT, the transport union, said yesterday it would ballot its members at London Underground over industrial action in protest at plans to change working practices and cut up to 5,000 jobs. The union said the ballot would be over the principle of management refusing to deal with change through the bargaining procedures. It added that London Underground was trying to bring in the changes through piecemeal measures. Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the union, had given London Underground a deadline of 4pm yesterday to make changes to the way it is introducing its new Company Plan. In a letter to London Underground, Mr Knapp had asked for a written undertaking that it 'immediately reverse all initiatives' already taken to change working conditions. London Underground, which ignored the deadline, said it was trying to agree negotiating machinery which would be as local as possible. It said some changes to management grades which the union was objecting to fell outside the union's remit.</p>

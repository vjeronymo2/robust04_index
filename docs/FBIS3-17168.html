Pro Patria will be represented at the talks by the party  Chairman Mart Laar, General Secretary Ivo Rull, deputy head of  the parliament faction, Kalle Jurgenson, and MP Vootele Hansen.  The delegation of Rural Centrists will include party Chairman  Ivar Raig, chairman of the party's Central Council, Vambo Kaal,  Agriculture Minister Jaan Leetsar and Minister of Reform Liia  Hanni.    MP Vootele Hansen in a brief interview with BNS said the  meeting was to discuss finding finances to credit the farm  sector, as well as drawing up legislation for regulation of the  market. "Of course, we don't consider it possible to give up  free market principles," he said.    Rural Centrist Party's Vambo Kaal, in turn, said his party  hoped to resolve issues such as protecting of the domestic  market, financing and taxation of the rural economy,  privatization, problems of cooperation within the coalition.    "If we fail to succeed in resolving the problems by mutual  compromise, we cannot continue our activity as part of the  coalition," Kaal said.    Pro Patria this week is also to begin talks with the Social  Democrats, the other party beside Rural Centrists in the ruling  coalition's Moderate bloc. Mart Laar, Ivo Rull, as well as Pro  Patria parliament faction chairman Tiit Sinissaar and Defense  Minister Indrek Kannik are to sit down at the negotiating table  opposite a delegation of the Social Democrats led by the leader  of the party, Social Affairs Minister Marju Lauristin.    Mihkel Parnoja, deputy chairman of the Social Democrats, has  told BNS the key issue for his party at talks with the senior  coalition partner is cooperation within the coalition until next  the elections. He said cooperation within the coalition could  be better, especially since over some issues coordination in the  coalition tends to happen too late.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 20, 9-15 May 94] </F>   [Text] As Mikhail Kovalko, chairman of the Ukrainian State  Committee for Oil and Gas, tipped off in an interview to  UKRINFORM's correspondent, Turkmenistan notified Ukraine on 7  May about resumption of its natural gas supplies to Ukraine.    However, the entire amount, which was piped from the Central  Asian nation, has settled in Russia, according to the Ukrgazprom  concern's dispatching service. Its factual piping from Russia to  Ukraine is expected to occur by 17 May. In this way, daily  Turkmen gas piping is supposed to average 75 to 80 million cu. m  [cubic meters]. By that time, Ukraine's delegation is to  finalize an agreement with the Russian Gazprom supplier on  charges for Turkmen gas transit piping through Russia's  territory to Ukraine's border.    The Ukrainian delegation was in Moscow on 15 and 16 May.    On 19 May Gazprom's delegation is expected to arrive in Kiev  to negotiate this and other issues of mutual interest with the  Ukrainian Government.    More likely than not, the Russian delegation will push for  Russia's hand in Ukrainian joint-stock societies to be set up as  a result of denationalization of Ukraine's oil and gas complex  (in the context of President Kravchuk's decree on establishment  of the holding-type National Joint-Stock Company).    Turkmenistan's announcement about gas supply resumption (if  ever Turkmen gas reaches Ukraine) probably occurred quite  unrelated to the problem of Ukraine's indebtedness to  Turkmenistan for the latter's natural gas supplies, though it  was precisely this reason that Turkmenistan mentioned, when it  terminated gas supplies to Ukraine in mid-February.    So far, there has been no official confirmation of the  "Republika" concern's repayment of Ukraine's debt, which  intention was widely rumored in March (see UBN No. 16/1994),  since the concern was authorized to do so by the Ukrainian  Government. Moreover, on 5 April acting Prime Minister  Zvyahilskyy complained that he could not contact Igor Bakai, the  concern's president, and that the government did not possess  money enough to repay the debt on its own.    Should Turkmen gas supplies prove regular, Ukrgazprom would  stock them in underground storages, as well as natural gas  amounts, economized by domestic consumers, to be utilized during  the fall-winter heating period.    In this way, Ukraine could receive about 20 billion cu. m.  of  Turkmen gas (1994's original figure was set at 28 billion cu.  m.). The issue of repayment remains open, however.    Russian natural gas supplies within the 6 through 13 May  period exceeded the planned amount by 247.2 million cu. m. (they  totalled 3,959.2 million cu. m.). Their daily amount averaged  565.6 million cu. m.    Ukraine's gas consumption during the same period amounted to  1,448.3 million cu. m. versus the expected figure of 1,847.3  million cu. m. with the daily consumption average of 906.9  million cu. m.</p>

Introduction </H5>   Lakes, swamps and suburban rivers of cities have been  growingly polluted recently in accordance with various kinds of  waste water drainage. From the viewpoint of resources both for  domestic and industrial waters, much call has been made on the  advanced water treatment technique in addition with the  conventional one. In this advanced water treatment, more  adsorption operation is employed by granular and powdered  activated carbon for the purpose of removal of organic  substances, color, odor, etc.    We already succeeded in a promising result from two  experiments at Kashiwai Water-works of Chiba Prefecture and  Murano of Osaka Prefecture using a pitch-based activated carbon  fiber (ACF). This paper deals with the further development that  the pitch-based ACF has been reformed and the development of  higher performance ACF ventured on.  <H5>  2. Reforming ACF </H5>   Necessity has been confirmed by experiments for  commercialization so far conducted on the conventional  pitch-based ACF to improve the removal performance of dissolved  organic substances and Tri-Holomethane Formation Potential  compounds. Thus, improvement of the above-mentioned removal  performance was experimented by enlarging micropore size based  on this ACF.    2-1 Micropore Distribution of Reformed Carbon Fiber    The reformed carbon fiber used at this experiment is one  reactivated after the conventional pitch-based ACF was applied  with a special treatment. The microporous distribution was  measured by the low-temperature nitrogen adsorption method. An  example of the results is shown on Table 1 and Figure 1.  &lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt;   &lt;graphic&gt;  &lt;capt&gt; Figure 1. Pore Distribution&lt;/graphic&gt;     It is known from these data that, while keeping micropore,  mesopore has increased on selective basis. Especially, in the  reformed carbon fiber of C-Series, it is seen that pore nearly  19 Angstroms is exceedingly growing.    According with this phenomenon, the adsorption performance  on  high-molecular substance is expected to be growing.    2-2 Surface Observation by Scanning-Type Electron  Microscope    Electron microscopic photos taken at pre- and post-reforming  are shown in Figure 2 [not reproduced] and Figure 3 [not  reproduced], respectively. Compared with a very smooth surface  before reforming, mesopore is observed to have occurred after  reforming. However, its generation was not much and no change  was made on the radius of fiber, so it is regarded that there is  no problem for the utilization of water treatment.    2-3 Adsorption Test by Model Materials    The adsorption performance was confirmed using such model  materials as Vitamin B[.sub]12[/], DBS (Dodecyl Benzene  Sulfonic Acid Natrium), PTS (Pala-Toluene Sulfonic Acid  Natrium), BS (Benzene Sulfonic Acid Natrium). Figure 4 [not  reproduced] shows the result of adsorption performance of  large-molecular Vitamin B[.sub]12[/]. Improved adsorption  performance was confirmed compared with conventional ACF (A-10:  1000 m[.sup]2[/]/g). Especially, it shows a performance  surpassing granular activated carbon in the most-advanced,  reformed sample (E-1).    DBS, PTS and BS are different in the alkyl group combined to  the benzene ring, and the order of adsorption performance to  respective activated carbon was so much varied that it was  impossible to explain merely by mesopore like Vitamin  B[.sub]12[/].    However, the adsorption performance of the reformed carbon  fiber was equal or more for each of materials. In other words,  it is known that the adsorption performance will never be  degraded by reforming and that of larger molecular material has  been improved. The remarkable improvement of reformed carbon  fiber in its adsorption performance has been confirmed also with  TOC and TOXP.  <H5>  3. Water Treatment Test by Reformed Carbon </H5>   A model test of water treatment was conducted using reformed  carbon fiber. Industrial water was filtered by Watman paper and  the adsorption treatment effect was confirmed by amount of  Tri-Halomethane [as published] Formation Potential after  adsorption and dissolved organic substance. The typical  condition of water flow is shown on Table 2 and the removal  effect on Table 3.       Table 2.

Conclusion </H5>   The following conclusion was derived as a result of the  execution of advanced water treatment test using reformed  activated carbon fiber.    (1) Required activation degree of reformed carbon fiber    The activation nearly equal to that of reformed carbon fiber  shown on Table 1 is required in order to attain the target level  of removal, THM Potential &gt;  80 percent and TOC &gt;  50  percent,  and, it is judged that advanced treatment performance, either  equal to or more than granular activated carbon will be  attained, if reformed carbon fiber around this level is used.    (2) Water flow condition    Subject to the activation degree of reformed carbon fiber,  the condition will be required somewhere around: SV = 8  Hr[.sup]-1[/], water flow ratio = 50 m[.sup]3[/]/ACF-kg.    (3) Regeneration    Regeneration by alkali is possible with any of reformed  carbons fiber, same as raw material carbon fiber.</p>

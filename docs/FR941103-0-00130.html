			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Refuge Recreation Act authorizes the Secretary to administer areas within the Refuge System for public recreation as an appropriate incidental or secondary use only to the extent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it is practicable and not inconsistent with the primary purpose(s) for which the areas were established. The Refuge Recreation Act also authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations to carry out the purposes of the Act. Hunting and sport fishing plans are developed for each refuge prior to opening it to hunting or fishing. In many cases, refuge-specific hunting and fishing regulations are included in the hunting and sport fishing plans to ensure the compatibility of the hunting and sport fishing programs with the purposes for which the refuge was established. Initial compliance with the NWRSAA and Refuge Recreation Act is ensured when hunting and sport fishing plans are developed, and the determinations required by these acts are made prior to the addition of refuges to the lists of areas open to hunting and fishing in 50 CFR part 32. Continued compliance is ensured by annual review of hunting and sport fishing programs and regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information collection requirements for part 32 are found in 50 CFR part 25 and have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and assigned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clearance number 1018&hyph;0014.

In addition, a review under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) has been done to determine whether the rulemaking would have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities, which include businesses, organizations or governmental jurisdictions. This rule would have minimal effect on such entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

He  said factional fighting within the Royal Lesotho Defense Force  had put the country's fledgling democracy to a severe test.    King Letsie was speaking at a banquet in Maseru last night  which he held for the Botswana president, Sir Ketumile Masire,  and the Zimbabwean president, Mr. Robert Mugabe, who went to  Lesotho to discuss the recent fracas in that country. He noted  that the soldiers returned to the barracks after mediation by  church leaders and international and regional organizations,  including SADC [Southern African Development Community] and  Frontline States leaders.    King Letsie said Basotho were encouraged to realize that the  SADC-Frontline States region was now adopting a more proactive  role in matters concerning regional stability and peace. He  called on Basotho and the government to use the opportunity  provided by the return to peace to pursue, deepen, and broaden  national reconciliation to include all areas of national  endeavor to encompass all sectors of Lesotho without any  exception.    President Masire and Mr. Mugabe held meetings with Lesotho's  parliamentarians and former King Moshoeshoe II this morning.  They later met opposition leaders and were expected to meet  army commanders. Sir Ketumile is expected to address a press  conference at the airport before leaving for Gaborone this  afternoon at 1530.</p>

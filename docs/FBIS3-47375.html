			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 12 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  carries an article titled "Scores Must be Settled With Fascist  Regime."    Noting that though nearly a year has passed since the Kim  Yong- sam regime made its appearance, styling itself a "civilian  government," nothing has changed in South Korea, the author of  the article says:    As for the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime, it is the  "second-term  fascist government of the Sixth Republic", an offspring of the  "Sixth Republic" of No Tae-u who made himself infamous with  treacheries, fascism and murder.    In advertising "civilian administration," Kim Yong-sam the  traitor has sought to veil the ugly color of his regime, not to  shape any civilian politics.    What the Kim Yong-sam group has done under the "civilian"  veil has been to put the people under heavier yoke of colonial  slavery and bind them tighter to fascist chains, to drive the  economy and the people's living to the worst phase with  deceptive "reforms" and bring the situation of the country to  the brink of war.    With the traitorous and fascist nature of the "civilian"  regime and the fictitious nature of the "reforms" advertised by  it fully revealed, the South Korean people have nothing to  expect from it. What they have to do now is to finally settle  scores with the false "civilian" regime.    The crafty "civilian" dictatorship is more heinous than the  brutal military dictatorship and the former's consequences are  more serious.    Kim Yong-sam is a rare fascist, warmaniac and traitor who  would unhesitatingly turn the whole of South Korea into a sea of  blood and plunge the nation into a nuclear holocaust for his  personal comfort and distinction and maintenance of his power.    The Kim Yong-sam fascist clique is destined to meet a  disgraceful doom in face of the strong resistance of the  pro-reunification democratic forces.</p>

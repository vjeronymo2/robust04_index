The French oil lobby has expressed dismay at this step on the  part of the regime, since it had earlier promised French  companies significant privileges. The regime even implied that  it was willing to grant the Iraqi Majnun oilfields to French  companies in return for billions of dollars, which these  companies would have made up for in a matter of weeks through  oil export sales.    France is dissatisfied with the changes, which French  security sources attribute to the regime's attempts to gain U.S.  favor at the expense of the promises he made to the French oil  lobbies. Political observers interpret the regime's conduct with  France as a deliberate attempt to drag the United States into  allying with it and negotiating an oil deal that would ease the  oil embargo imposed on the regime and an attempt to restore  normal bilateral ties with the United States.    In this framework, the Kurdish opposition in Turkey has  destroyed the Iraqi oil pipeline that passes through Turkey,  wasting several millions of barrels of oil ready for export--the  oil that remained in the pipes after the imposition of the oil  embargo by the UN Security Council. This was reported by  Turkish sources, but was not reported by any neutral  international source. Political observers believe that the  matter is nothing more than an attempt to settle accounts  between the regime and Turkey concerning the oil that remained  in the pipeline. Turkey demanded the lion's share with the  excuse that it had been harmed by the Kuwait war. Saddam's  regime, for its part, demanded half of the oil. However, visits  among officials of the two sides, in addition to the Turkish  political stance that recently has tended to demand a lifting of  the embargo and the reinstatement of the regime to the  international family, indicate that this is part of an economic  deal to enable Turkey to get what it wants in exchange for  political backing for Saddam's regime.    To avoid embarrassment, the two sides preferred to accuse  the  Kurdish opposition in Turkey, thus achieving their collective  objectives. This means that Saddam's regime pays no attention  to the wealth, resources, and interests of the Iraqi people  since its ultimate goal is to remain in office and commit the  most horrible crimes against our kinsmen in Iraq.</p>

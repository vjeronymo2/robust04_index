			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: VW quits small car venture with Swiss group VOLKSWAGEN, the German carmaker, has been forced to abandon its pioneering small car development project with SMH, the Swiss watchmaker. . VW, under financial pressure with profits falling, is pulling out to avoid heavy investment in the project. SMH said VW was withdrawing because it had to cut costs. The Swiss company, maker of the popular Swatch watch, said it would continue with the project and was considering offers and alternative partners. VW joined forces two years ago with SMH to develop a small electric car for city use. It is continuing development work on its own city car project, called Chico, which may be powered by a hybrid petrol/electric power unit or by a small two-cylinder engine under development. General Motors, the US carmaker, said yesterday that sales of its Opel/Vauxhall cars in Europe reached a record 1.61m units last year, a 3.9 per cent rise from 1.55m in 1991. GM said its cars, which are sold under the Opel brand in continental Europe and Vauxhall in the UK, captured 12.0 per cent of west European new car sales in 1992 compared with 11.6 per cent a year earlier. Total GM group car sales in west Europe (including Saab, Lotus and imports from the US) rose to 1.69m last year, which pushed GM into second place in the west European new car sales league behind the Volkswagen group, which includes which Audi, Seat and Skoda. GM began production last year at two new assembly plants in eastern Germany and in Hungary. It opened an engine plant in Hungary, where it has taken over as market leader. It expects to be lifted in Europe with the launch this spring of a new generation small car to replace the Opel Corsa/Vauxhall Nova.</p>

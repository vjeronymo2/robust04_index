			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NOTHING CAN DENY JIM PALMER RIGHTFUL PLACE IN HALL OF FAME  </P> <P> The Baseball Hall of Fame ballot arrived Wednesday, and there was Jim Palmer's  name on it. Once I checked to make sure he hadn't been nominated for the  announcers' wing, I put my X next to his name. He belongs the first year he's  eligible. He belongs on every ballot. His numbers (if not his play-by-play)  speak for themselves.  </P> <P> Palmer will be the first Hall of Famer most of you have been privileged to see  in his underwear, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Get to know your Hall  of Famers. Sportswriters routinely see future Hall of Famers -- also Larry  Sheets -- in their underwear. When we say we know the players, warts and all,  we mean that literally.  </P> <P> Palmer is basically wartless. He won 20 games eight times. He won three Cy  Youngs. He was 268-152 with a 2.86 earned run average. He gave Earl Weaver  heartburn. He was never, ever, ever dull. He graces larger-than-life  billboards.  </P> <P> Every player with his larger-than-life credentials is in the Hall of Fame, and  Palmer, who played a role in nearly every great Orioles moment, will be, too.  Make your reservations for Cooperstown now.  </P> <P> And yet he's not the most obvious choice this go-round. I would rate Palmer  among the top six or seven pitchers of his generation -- mid-'60s to mid-'80s  -- along with Sandy Koufax, Tom Seaver, Bob Gibson, Juan Marichal, Steve  Carlton and Nolan Ryan. But Joe Morgan, who also comes eligible this year,  might be the best second baseman ever.  </P> <P> The sabremeticians and other baseball nuts who spend quality time alone in  their one-room apartments, stocked only with a calculator, batteries and a  dog-eared Baseball Encyclopedia, suggest that Morgan is even better than Rogers  Hornsby.  </P> <P> The only Hornsby I ever saw was Bruce, and he couldn't turn the double play.  Morgan, I saw. On a team featuring Johnny Bench and Pete Rose and Tony Perez  and George Foster, Morgan was, in his best years, without peer. In the other  years, he was merely great. He was the heart of any team he ever played on.  Numbers (a .271 lifetime batting average, 268 homers) don't begin to describe  Morgan's value, but he did routinely walk 100 times a year, score 100 runs a  year, hit as many as 27 homers a year, stole 50 to 60 bases a year. And he was  even better than the sum of his parts.  </P> <P> OK, Morgan and Palmer. Seal the envelope and mail it in?  </P> <P> Last year, in my first as a voter, I wrestled with the concept of what  constitutes a Hall of Famer. (Forget character. Babe Ruth drank too much; Ty  Cobb was the most hated man in the game. So don't tell me that Gaylord Perry  doesn't belong because he found creative uses for hair cream.) The strict  constructionists argue that only those players who fit in comfortably with,  say, Ted Williams and Willie Mays belong.  </P> <P> I tend to agree, and yet, as I did last year, I've decided to lengthen the  list. Why? Because if Don Drysdale is in the Hall of Fame, then Perry should be  in there, too. If Stan Coveleski belongs, so does Ferguson Jenkins. If Johnny  Mize is in there, Orlando Cepeda belongs. In fact, in Cepeda's case, you can  make a decent argument that his statistics are comparable to Willie McCovey's.  </P> <P> That's my list -- Palmer, Morgan, Perry, Jenkins and Cepeda. You can vote for  10, but I'm stretching the point only so far. I left off Jim Bunning, a good  pitcher who won 224 games and who has a lot of support among voters. I left off  Ken Boyer and Ron Santo, both good third basemen who drove in a lot of runs. I  left off Dick Allen and Vada Pinson, who each started fast but faded. I left  off Bobby Bonds, who was Hall-of-Fame potential anyway. I left off Tony Oliva  despite his three batting titles. I left off Maury Wills even though he  probably helped change the face of the game. I left off Jim Kaat, who won 283  games over -- get this -- 25 years.  </P> <P> Perry won 314 games, with 300 being a reasonable benchmark for greatness. He  won the Cy Young in both leagues. Over 22 years, Perry had an ERA of 3.10. He  wasn't Koufax. He wasn't Palmer. He was close enough. All Jenkins did was win  20 games seven times, six in succession, pitching too much of the time in  Wrigley Field, which should entitle him to some kind of award. He was 284-226,  and if you're wavering, keep thinking Don Drysdale, Don Drysdale, Don Drysdale.  </P> <P> Cepeda won't make it. He won't make it because he played in the shadow of Mays  and McCovey, and he won't make it because he went to jail after his career had  ended, and he won't make it because he's a close call anyway. But he hit over  .300 nine times, drove in 100 or more runs five times and 90 or more nine  times, hit at least 25 homers eight times. He was an MVP and an 11-time  All-Star.  </P> <P> Last year, Carl Yastrzemski made it on his first try, with fewer homers per  at-bat than Cepeda, with only six years batting .300 and seven years with  90-plus RBI.  </P> <P> In Baltimore, Cepeda's fate is of little interest this year. All eyes will  naturally be on Palmer. This won't be a nail-biter, folks. He's a sure thing.  The only question is whether Earl Weaver will introduce him at the induction  ceremony. That sure gets my vote.  </P> <P> Michael Young  </P></p>

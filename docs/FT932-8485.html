			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Gatt gives qualified welcome to recent EC trade developments Gatt's governing council yesterday gave a qualified welcome to recent EC trade developments, despite reservations on some individual policies and programmes, Frances Williams writes. Gatt members broadly agreed that the single market had enhanced market flexibility and improved business opportunities for internal and external suppliers alike. However, there was criticism that the replacement of national restrictions by Community-wide measures had raised external trade barriers for cars, canned fish and bananas. Defending EC policies, Mr Roderick Abbott, head of international trade policy in Brussels, said that trade with countries outside Europe (excluding oil) accounted for two-thirds of total trade and nearly 70 per cent of EC imports entered duty-free or on best available terms. EC harmonisation aimed to reduce trade barriers, while the Europe Agreements with eastern Europe were designed to eliminate all restrictions within a specified period. Gatt membership has risen to 111 with the accession yesterday of St Vincent and the Grenadines, a tiny Caribbean banana producer.</p>

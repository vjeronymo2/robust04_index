Khusro: "Direct Foreign Investment"] </F>   [Text] Recent policy reforms in India have given  substantial facilities and freedoms to foreign investors,  including a 51 percent access to equity in Indian firms and  management control, along with other concessions. But the demand  for more and more concessions continues and the actual foreign  investment flow, though larger, is well below the $1 billion  mark.    There are many factors which influence and attract foreign  investment, such as security, profitability, lower tax rates,  avoidance of double taxation, percentage of equity permitted,  freedom to manage corporate enterprises, expectations about  customs and excise duties and freedom to repatriate dividends  and capital. But these and many other factors do not have the  same weight: some factors may have a weight of one percent in  the investors' reckoning while others may have a 30 percent  weight. This aspect is neglected by analysts and even by  investors themselves. In the case of India, while many of these  factors have moved in the direction of greater facilities and  freedoms, what is compelling in investors' decision-making and  should weigh much more than other factors in (a) the security  aspect and (b) the profitability.    Analysts within India go by the feel for policy reform while  foreign investors, not knowing the atmosphere too well, go by  stark logic. Within the country, one knows that most of the new  economic policies, if not all, are non-reversible. All political  parties which have a chance of running the government in the  foreseeable future are committed to policy reform, including  liberalisation, deregulation and globalisation. In their  election manifestos, all parties, except those on the extreme  left, have favoured liberalisation and globalisation though, for  political reasons, they may momentarily oppose this or that  aspect of the new policies. The moment one abstracts from the  temporary politics of economics, it becomes clear that the new  policies cannot be reversed: no one is going to make the rupee  non-convertible on trade account; only the market will change  the external value of the rupee and the market has already  signalled that the rupee is stable. The new trends of export  growth--a 25 percent increase in dollar terms within six  months--point out the strengthening of the rupee. And the  foreign exchange reserves which increased from $1 billion to $8  billion--within two years--also run in the same direction. No  one is going to bring Rs.2,000 crore in the budget to provide  export subsidies once again. Industrial licensing took nearly 40  years to build and once demolished in the last two years, no one  is going to replace the delicensed system with a licensed and,  therefore, controlled system. Once people taste the freedoms of  decontrol, they do not vote for controls so easily. No one is  going to argue for higher import duties, high excise and high  tax rates, nor would any government feel competent in the  foreseeable future to nationalise the Indian public enterprises.  Those who know the milieu, know that the future will not favour  nationalisation but denationalisation and privatisation, not  higher but lower direct taxes, not larger customs and excise  duties but smaller ones. If foreign investors have been allowed  a 51 percent access to Indian equity, this proportion can only  increase in the future and not decrease. In other words, foreign  investors can expect with certainty a greater liberalisation  rather than its reversal and a move towards globalisation rather  than an inward-looking shift.    As for security of foreign investment, it is known to all  that India has never defaulted on repayment or repatriation of  capital or on the payment of interest and dividend. Foreign  financial institutions, including the World Bank, which have  rated the countries of the world according to national  purchasing power, have ranked India in the fifth or the sixth  position, with all the changes that have recently been made and  the policy improvements that have been brought about. It is  astonishing that international reckoners like MOODY, have not  revised India's rating upwards, so much so that one suspects a  degree of bias in these ratings. No wonder that investors are  ignoring these ratings and are no longer sitting on the  fence--with the result that each day that passes brings an  announcement of one foreign company or another actually coming  in with an investment thus capitalising on industrial approvals  already given.    As for the expanionist market, it is clear that the market  prospects in other countries, with the possible exception of  China, are incomparably better in India and that should be the  prime consideration for foreign investors. One of our  distinguished analysts, a former Governor of the RBI, an  illustrious civil servant and a former Ambassador to the United  States, the late L.K. Jha, addressed the German industrialists  at the Hanover fair in 1984 and gave them a peep into the  future. India's GNP, Jha said, was $175 billion in 1984 and,  given its established rate of growth, would stand around $230  billion, or more, in 1994 (at the 1984 value). It is known that  about 10 percent of it is spent on durable consumer goods and,  at that rate, about $23 billion worth of durable consumer goods  should be expected annually to be in demand in 1994 and beyond.  German industrialists, Jha said, could plan to take advantage of  this huge development and participate in meeting the increased  demand either directly or through investment and technologies  relevant to that demand. Nothing that Jha said has been  controverted in these ten years and the scene, in fact, looks  even better.    As for the security of the regime, which foreign investors  and analysts sometimes talk about, it should be noted that  people confuse the stability of a particular political party  with the stability of the country. All changes of  government--six or seven of them--since Independence, have been  smooth and impressive. All the political parties are committed  to reform except for momentary opposition, often to embarrass  the government and not to actually press for a policy reversal.  In any case, the recent elections in some northern states of the  country would seem to confirm that even the party ruling at the  Centre at present has no fear of being removed from power even  though it would not matter for the stability of economic  policies if it did yield to another political party.    All in all, the dominant factors for foreign investment--the  expected direction of policy, the security, and the  profitability in a rapidly expanding market--are the factors  whose weight is far bigger than the sum total of other items of  reckoning which influence foreign investment. And, as these are  at a highly satisfactory level and are moving in the right  direction, one can safely forecast that foreign investment will  expand rapidly hereafter.</p>

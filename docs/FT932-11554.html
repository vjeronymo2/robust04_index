			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Making money milking camels: Michael Holman reports on a prizewinning dairy venture in Mauritania THEY are proud and intelligent, good-natured, with beautiful eyes, and communicate in a language of murmurs and grunts. What is more, continues Nancy Abeiderrahmane, warming to her theme, you can eat them, ride them, wear them, sleep on and under them: their hair is woven into tents, their wool is turned into carpets, their treated skin becomes leather. You can also milk them. Camels are close to Mrs Abeiderrahmane's heart. British born and a citizen of Mauritania by marriage, Mrs Abeiderrahmane runs a pioneering camel milk dairy - Laitiere de Mauritanie - in the country's capital, Nouakchott. It has earned her one of the prestigious Rolex 'awards for enterprise', presented every three years by the Swiss watchmaking company. In Geneva for the ceremony, Mrs Abeiderrahmane recounted the hurdles she overcame when establishing the first dairy in Africa to pasteurise camels' milk on a commercial scale. And thanks to the discovery of a new enzyme, it is the first in the world to produce camel's cheese, soon to be exported to France. The benefits for Mauritania, a mainly desert country in northwest Africa, could prove considerable, she says. They include savings in foreign exchange spent on imported dairy products, improved nutritional standards, curbing the drift of labour from countryside to city, and combating desertification. And what serves Mauritania could well apply to a swathe of countries across Africa's arid Sahel zone, through Sudan and Somalia on the east coast, as well as northern Kenya. Mrs Abeiderrahmane, 45, studied as an industrial engineer in Barcelona, Spain, and has lived in Nouakchott since 1970. But it was not until 1987 that she found time from the demands of rearing four children to put her technical expertise to practical effect. By then Nouakchott's population had grown dramatically. From around 500 at independence in 1960 it had risen to nearly 500,000, almost 25 per cent of the nomadic population of a country almost twice the size of France. A way of life had ended. As nomads, they got their milk from their animals - 750,000 camels and 1.25m cows. As city dwellers, they came to rely on imported products, over 50,000 tons a year of sterilised or powdered milk, often of poor quality and a drain on Mauretania's scarce foreign exchange. Mrs Abeiderrahmane decided to process locally produced camel milk, sold raw, in buckets. First she had to resolve technical difficulties that arose, then raise the money, and finally overcome consumer resistance to the new product. For two tough years - 'I was manager, secretary, accountant, foreman, and driver' - it was touch and go. The camel herds were scattered, their yields low and collection expensive, and prejudices had to be overcome. Many Mauritanians believed imported European milk was somehow better - though camels' milk is higher in vitamin C, potassium and iron, and lower in fat. Today the milk, packaged in cartons under the brand name Tiviski, has sufficient sales to put the balance sheet into credit for the first time. Meanwhile, income from regular collection of their milk makes city life less appealing for the network of nomadic herders. There's more to be learnt from Mrs Abeiderrahmane. The female camel requires up to four times less fodder to produce a litre of milk than a cow; and in a drought the camel, unlike the cow, does not dry up. The camel is also environmentally friendly: its wide-splayed hooves do not damage the fragile surface of arid or semi-arid terrains of the Sahel in the way that the sharp surfaces of cows' hooves do. It's the stuff of Mrs Abeiderrahmane's vision. For a thousand years camels plied the great trade routes between Africa and Asia. The ship of the desert will adapt to the needs of a different age - as an environmentally friendly, fodder-efficient, foreign exchange-saving, low-fat dairy of the dunes.</p>

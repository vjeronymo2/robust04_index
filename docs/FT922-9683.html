			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Leading Article: A strategy for UK education MR JOHN Patten, Britain's new education secretary, faces an embarras de richesses in implementing the Conservative manifesto pledge to increase the number of grant maintained schools opting out of local education authority control. Half a dozen education authorities are encouraging their schools to opt out en bloc, to avoid a two-tier system with some opted-out and others not. Given the generous funding available to grant-maintained schools, this is a very real danger. Mr Patten has condemned such mass opt-outs as attempts by town hall bureaucrats to manage the process to their own advantage. Ministers believe that education authorities are trying to structure the terms of disengagement to foist town hall services on opted-out schools. More validly, they say that opting out can work only if the parents, governors, head and teachers work as a team to make the new arrangements work. But the response from these  - often Conservative  - authorities reflects nothing more than a recognition that opting out is here to stay. While only just over 200 of the 23,000 schools in England and Wales have so far opted out, the return of a Conservative government has accelerated the process. More than 2,000 schools have asked for details of the procedures, and most secondary schools are likely to make the jump during the next five years. Legislation is promised to allow smaller primary schools to opt out in groups. Weak mechanism This raises fundamental questions about the future of education in England and Wales. One is how such schools are to be managed: the mechanism of control appears to be weak, as the experience of Stratford school, east London shows. Its school governors have been at loggerheads with the head teacher for some months, throwing the school - and the education of its children  - into turmoil. The former education secretary Mr Kenneth Clarke attempted to intervene three times, largely without success. If thousands of schools are to opt out, the Education Department will have to create a decentralised administration to manage and fund them, not to mention an authority representing the views of the wider community beyond parent-dominated boards of governors. This task could be fulfilled by modified local education authorities acting as purchasers of education services; if the government has some other idea in mind, the time has come to explain it. Efficiency questions Then there are questions of efficiency and economy. Eliminating 1.5m surplus school places cannot be done other than by closing schools, yet schools threatened by closure can often avoid this fate by opting out. Similar problems arise with plans to re-organise post-16 education into sixth-form colleges: schools which wish to retain sixth forms can opt out to thwart rationalisation. With additional resources needed in many parts of the education system, the profligacy which this anarchy permits cannot be tolerated. Some way of closing surplus capacity and avoiding wasteful duplication must be found; schools cannot do this on their own. Finally, there is the question of selection. Increasingly opted-out schools will specialise and provide for special needs, creating 'centres of excellence'. This is commendable, but there are signs that specialisation is becoming an excuse for re-introducing selection. The London borough of Wandsworth, for example, last night voted to abandon comprehensive education and make all its secondary schools selective. Supporters say this will increase diversity and improve choice for parents. But the unpalatable truth is that such a process is likely to recreate a two-tier education system, with selective schools creaming off the most able and motivated, reducing choice and probably resources for the rest. Genuine choice requires well-funded technical and vocational schools enjoying parity of esteem with more academic schools. A stable institutional and policy framework is essential if managerial reforms such as opting out are to be successful. Before encouraging a stampede of opt outs, Mr Patten should produce a medium-term educational strategy which encompasses such a framework and offers a vision for the future.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Asda launches Pounds 347m rights issue to accelerate recovery ASDA, the grocery retailer, has launched a Pounds 347m rights issue only 15 months after it raised Pounds 357m through a similar exercise. The move, along with Wessex Water's Pounds 113m rights issue on Tuesday, is expected to mark the beginning of a series of deals to raise equity capital. Companies are keen to take advantage of a relatively buoyant stock market and to raise money from the City before the government's demand for funds to finance the budget deficit becomes too onerous. Mr Archie Norman, chief executive of Asda, said yesterday that the group had planned to make a rights issue towards the end of this year but decided to come earlier. He said he warned Morgan Grenfell, Asda's merchant bank, before Christmas that the company might launch an issue early in 1993. Less than three weeks ago he asked the bank and Asda's brokers for a date as soon as possible. Mr Norman said yesterday: 'There are a lot of rights issues in the pipeline. When I met Morgan Grenfell I told them: 'I want to be first''. He said the group had no immediate need for the money but wanted to accelerate a recovery programme begun in May. The issue marks a further step in the transformation of Asda, which 18 months ago seemed to be in severe, and some thought irreversible, decline. The board has since been almost completely changed, with Mr Norman arriving in December 1991. The group's shares rose on the news, closing up 3 3/4 p at 67 3/4 p, indicating investor support for the issue. The previous rights issue was priced at 35p but the shares fell after that, reaching a low of 23p in August last year. Asda also made a profit forecast for the current year, to May 1, of Pounds 130m pre-tax and before an exceptional credit of Pounds 8.7m and the interest receivable on the rights issue money, estimated at Pounds 3.5m. This would be a rise from Pounds 86.8m in 1991-92, before exceptional write-offs of Pounds 451.6m. Asda said sales in the current year in comparable stores were running 2 per cent ahead of the last financial year, an increase greater than it had expected. In the first half of the year sales growth was 1 per cent, and the improvement since then surprised brokers who follow the group. A final dividend of 1.1p is forecast, which would give a total of 1.6p, down from 2.1p the previous year and 4.8p in 1990-91. The profit forecast exceeded brokers' earlier estimates, but some then increased their forecasts to Pounds 135m or Pounds 140m. Estimates for the following year range between Pounds 180m and Pounds 190m. Running fast but still fourth Page 19 Lex Page 16</p>

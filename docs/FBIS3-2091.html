According to a top municipal government official, the city  has spent 26 billion yuan in building residential quarters over  the past 15 years, with newly-built apartments totalling some 80  million square meters in floor space, six times the amount in  1949 when New China was born.    Beijing Vice-Mayor Zhang Baifa, in a report delivered at a  meeting on housing, said that more than 1.3 million families  have moved into new homes since the start of China's reform and  opening to the outside world.    The average living space per capita increased to 8.3 square  meters in 1993 from 4.55 square meters in 1978, the official  said.    The pace of urban housing construction has quickened since  the 1980s. To date, more than 110 residential areas have been  built in urban districts, and 69 old and dangerous housing zones  have been rebuilt.    The official added that the current housing construction  drive has greatly improved both the citizens' living conditions  and the urban environment.    He said that the city has broken ground for about 10,000  square meters in newly-designed "comfortable apartment  buildings", with the aim of improving housing for people with  low incomes.    But, he noted, there are about 200,000 households still  living in very bad quarters, with an average living space of no  more than four square meters.    The official revealed that the city's goal for this year's  residential construction is 6.55 million square meters.    He urged government departments and leaders at all levels to  pay close attention to the work and to mobilize the broad masses  to promote housing construction and reform.</p>

'Arafat described the incident as a  new massacre. He said: We are facing a secret organization  from inside the Israeli Army and the settlers, which seeks to  destroy the peaceful solution.    The Palestinian president said he informed Washington and  Moscow, in their capacity as the sponsors of the peace  negotiations, about the incident and said the PLO will present a  memorandum to the Security Council in this regard. 'Arafat  stressed that the Israeli Army and Government are blamed for  such attacks against the Palestinian people. [passage omitted]</p>

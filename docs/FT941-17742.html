			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Imro plans to tighten checks on UK investment managers Britain's system for checking people who work in investment management is about to be tightened through new arrangements for registration of individuals. The board of Imro, the self-regulatory organisation for the industry, has approved provisional plans to create such a register. At present, Imro registers only firms of financial advisers and fund managers, and so does not necessarily know who works for any given firm. Imro members will be invited to comment on the proposals, due to be published early this month. Many people who would have to register as individuals will already have provided detailed information through questionnaires. They would not have to repeat that procedure, but would sign a form putting them in a new and direct contractual relationship with the regulator. Imro estimates that 15,000 to 20,000 individuals could be involved. Mr Phillip Thorpe, Imro's chief executive, said the proposal had two targets in particular: People who had worked for Imro member firms which had been disciplined and were subsequently employed by another firm; Individuals entering investment management from another area of financial services, perhaps covered by another regulator. The Securities and Futures Authority already operates a system of individual registration. While work began on the plans two to three months ago, the weakness of the current arrangements has been highlighted recently. Noble Lowndes, the financial adviser, was fined Pounds 740,000 by Imro, because four of its personal financial services consultants had given clients unsuitable investment advice. Although none of the four is still with Noble Lowndes, Imro has no way of knowing whether any of them is still working in the industry. Imro would issue guidance, but the onus would be on each firm to decide which individuals working for it needed to be registered. The requirement would be intended to apply wherever there was a need for investor protection.</p>

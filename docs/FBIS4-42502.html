			<p>BFN     [Text] Rostock (DDP/ADN) -- The FDP [Free Democratic Party]  this morning approved its electoral program for the Bundestag  election in October. In it, the liberals are recommending  themselves to the voters as the party of achievement and  committed defenders of the market economy. At the same time,  the FDP deliberately took a position of liberal independence  from its CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social  Union] coalition partner in the areas of domestic and social  policy and foreigners' affairs.    The vast majority of the delegates voted in Rostock for the  program; three voted against and there were three abstentions.</p>

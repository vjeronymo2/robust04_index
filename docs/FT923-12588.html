			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Observer: Tours off-duty Hush] Cabinet ministers' movements are of course top secret. Then again, however, John Major is committed to more open government. So here is what Observer has gleaned as to where Britain's political leaders will be seeking to forget the recession during their holiday. The prime minister's plans are under especially thick wraps. But it would scarcely be astonishing if he turned up in Spain, not just for the Olympic Games, but to stay at the house of foreign office minister and arch-Europhile Tristan Garel-Jones. Indeed, the likelihood that Major will come back yet more wedded to the perfidious Maastricht treaty is already being lamented by Tory Euro-sceptics. Meanwhile, one of their deep-dyed members, Peter Lilley, is nonetheless off to France - although cabinet colleagues may be wrong in expecting him to fare forth from his Normandy cottage to campaign for a 'No' in the French referendum. He's more likely to pop down to Provence where he might bump into not only William Waldegrave, but Michael Howard replete with wife and mother-in-law. Chief whip Richard Ryder, recuperating from putting down putative backbench rebellions, is ranging farther afield: the US certainly, and mayhap a Greek island. By contrast Norman Lamont's fondness for his new grace-and-favour house in Dorneywood is keeping him there much of the summer (if he invites a few economists down, the taxpayer will pick up the tab). For a break, he'll probably go to Tuscany where - if he's wanted by Douglas Hurd, who'll also be there - he might well be found in the garden of a trattoria near Lucca. As for the other Treasury member of the cabinet, Michael Portillo is said to be determined to belie his reputation as Whitehall's Scrooge. So he'll be slashing his colleagues' budgets from a beachside villa in Barbados. Perhaps in hope of mollifying him, big ministerial spender Virginia Bottomley is sojourning frugally with family on the Isle of Wight, while David Hunt and John Gummer are sailing together off Norfolk. Lord Wakeham, cabinet chief-fixer, is setting a more ambitious course from the south coast to Brittany. Even that, however, is too tame for Michael Heseltine. Hezza the Prezza, as he is now affectionately known, will be sketching his blueprint for Britain's industrial revival on an exotic island somewhere in the South Pacific.</p>

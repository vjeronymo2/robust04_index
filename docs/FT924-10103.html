			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: MAN's pace begins to slow down - The German truck maker after the unification boom MAN Nutzfahrzeuge, the German commercial vehicle maker, increased its pre-tax profits by 29.7 per cent in the 12 months to the end of June, the group's best financial performance. The record profits of the past two years have been fuelled by the very high level of domestic sales of trucks and buses generated mainly by German unification. But the company warned that truck demand in Germany has begun to weaken since the beginning of this year and MAN is now being forced to cut output in line with falling sales. It has reduced truck production by about 12 per cent. It plans to halt output for one week this month and again in January. It is also cutting overtime and not replacing temporary workers or those lost through natural wastage. Both profits and turnover are forecast to fall in the year. MAN has warned that further short-time working could be imposed in coming months if orders remain at a low level. While the outlook for the coming year is deteriorating, MAN's record financial performance in the 12 months to June contrasts starkly with the losses being suffered by other European truck makers, such as DAF and Volvo. In the period, MAN increased pre-tax profits by 29.7 per cent to DM506m (Dollars 328m), while turnover rose 6.9 per cent to a record DM7.9bn. Sales outside Germany were static at DM3.2bn, but domestic turnover jumped by 13 per cent to DM4.7bn. MAN raised its production of trucks and buses by 8.4 per cent to a record 41,590, with its plants in Germany and Austria working at full capacity. MAN truck and bus sales worldwide rose by 7 per cent to 40,815 in 1991-92 from 38,146. The increase was achieved despite a fall in the total west European market for trucks to 277,000 in calendar 1991, from 287,000 a year earlier. MAN raised its west European truck market share to 12.4 per cent last year from 10 per cent a year earlier, thanks to its strong presence in Germany. Excluding Germany, the west European truck market fell by 22 per cent to 170,000 last year from 216,000 in 1990. But falling new orders from the domestic German market, combined with stagnant or declining demand from export markets, led to a 20.3 per cent fall in the value of new orders booked by MAN in the 12 months to the end of June. Orders totalled DM7.2bn. The value of new domestic orders fell by 28.1 per cent to DM4.1bn, while foreign orders fell by 6.5 per cent to DM3.1bn. At the end of June, the group's order book had fallen by 22.7 per cent to DM3.49bn from levels of a year earlier. In the quarter to September this financial year, the value of new orders has fallen again - by 27.8 per cent to DM1.3bn, compared to DM1.8bn in the same period a year ago.</p>

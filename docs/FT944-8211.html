			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: Eyes now turning to Latin America - International Latin American debt has been among the worst casualties in this year's bond market melt-down. However, most observers say the sell-off has been overdone and recommend buying around current levels. 'We believe these markets are now very cheap,' says Ms Ingrid Iversen, senior economist at Morgan Grenfell. 'The fall has been overdone by whatever measures you apply,' she says. A recent study by Morgan Grenfell states that 'current Brady bond prices discount default risk at a rate which verges on the paranoid'. Latin bonds have been battered by rising US interest rates, heavy selling early in the year by leveraged accounts and a variety of domestic problems. As a result, the average stripped yield spread of the four largest Latin markets over US Treasuries has more than doubled to some 950 basis points, from 450 basis points at the beginning of the year. In Brazil, uncertainty ahead of the October elections overhung the market most of the year. However, bonds derived support from the implementation in July of the Real Plan and the election of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, enabling them to outperform all neighbouring markets. According to JP Morgan, Brazilian Brady bonds have posted a total return of some 6.5 per cent in the year to date. Mexico, too, was dogged by political worries ahead of the August election, exacerbated by the assassination of President-elect Donaldo Luis Colosio in March. Mexico was the region's second-best performer, although total returns there are down 11.5 per cent in the year to date. Argentina suffered from concern over its fiscal position and jitters ahead of elections in May. Although President Carlos Saul Menem is expected to be re-elected, 'people have been rattled by politics this year and are shy of countries with political uncertainty', says Mr Patrick Beeley, who runs the emerging markets bond sales desk at JP Morgan in London. Argentine bonds are down 21.61 per cent so far this year. Venezuela, meanwhile, has been the worst hit, posting a negative return of 32 per cent amid growing investor scepticism of the populist Caldera government. After getting badly burnt in the initial February sell-off, many investors moved into cash or money market instruments. But although US mutual funds withdrew billions of dollars from bond markets, few accounts have pulled out for good, and observers say there are large pools of cash waiting to get back into bonds. Moreover, new Latin American investors, such as Argentine and Brazilian pension funds, are expected to move in next year, says Ms Susan Segal, head of emerging and capital markets at Chemical Bank in New York. And even among US investors, many of whom have sought safety in equities this year, 'we are beginning to see more professional money reweighting back to the bond side', she says. 'We think people will get off the fence soon, and expect to see a significant pick-up in activity in December,' agrees Mr Jonathan Prior, head of emerging market debt trading at ING Bank. Brazil remains a favourite, especially after last week's state governor elections which gave President Cardoso the support he needs to implement his reforms. Some analysts are also bullish on Mexico in the hope that its credit rating will be raised to investment grade in 1995. Argentina is seen supported by solid long-term fundamentals. And Venezuela - given that most people believe it will continue to service its debt - 'is a screaming buy', says Ms Segal. In spite of their supportive fundamentals, Latin bonds remain inextricably linked to US Treasuries, whose erratic trading pattern they track slavishly. But 'while the opposing forces of weak US Treasuries and strong regional fundamentals will persist, I feel the latter will prevail sooner rather than later,' predicts Mr Beeley.</p>

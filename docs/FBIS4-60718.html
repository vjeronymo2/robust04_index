			<p>BFN     [Text] Viktor Posuvalyuk, the personal envoy of Russian  President Boris Yeltsin, is paying an official visit to Lebanon  to hold talks with officials on the Middle East peace process  and bilateral ties.    Posuvalyuk, who is director general of the Middle East and  North African Department in the Russian Foreign Ministry, voiced  his country's support for the continuation of peace  negotiations. He said that efforts are now focusing on ways to  eliminate the obstacles hindering the progress of the peace  process. He spoke at the Foreign Ministry, where he met with  Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz in the presence of ministry  Secretary General Ambassador Zafir al-Hasan; Ambassador Yusuf  Arsanyus, director of the foreign minister's office; and Russian  Ambassador Gennadiy Ilichev. The Russian president's envoy  arrived on the Lebanese-Syrian border point from Damascus before  noon today. He will meet tomorrow with Prime Minister Rafiq  al-Hariri before leaving for Amman and then going on to Israel.    Responding to reporters' questions at the Foreign Ministry  headquarters, Posuvalyuk said:    [Begin recording] [Posuvalyuk] I would like to say that my  trip to the region was launched on the instructions of President  Boris Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. Such visits  usually include two areas: one dealing with bilateral ties and  the other with the peace march. To answer your question, we had  a candid discussion with his excellency the foreign minister.  We discussed details pertaining to the Lebanese track in the  peace process. This helped us understand the actual situation  on the Lebanese-Israeli track.    [Correspondent] Can your tour be viewed as supplementary to  the U.S. secretary of state's tour of the region? In other  words, do you coordinate with Washington when it comes to  submitting certain ideas?    [Posuvalyuk] Yes, we constantly coordinate our steps with  the  American sponsor.    [Correspondent] What is your comment on the kidnapping of  Mustafa al-Dirani, and does this hinder the peace process?    [Posuvalyuk] I can say that we are concerned at what is  happening at present. We are discussing this issue with the  parties concerned. We believe in the need to eliminate all the  causes of increased tension on the Lebanese-Israeli track. This  must be based on UN resolutions, primarily Resolution 425.    [Correspondent] Do you expect the resumption of talks soon  or  are there obstacles?    [Posuvalyuk] We support the continuation of negotiations. We  are discussing ways to eliminate these obstacles.    [Correspondent] Have you found during your trip and contacts  that it is Israel that is hindering the resumption of  negotiations, or is it Arab states?    [Posuvalyuk] I said that we are discussing ways to eliminate  obstacles hindering progress in the peace process.    [Correspondent] [Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq] Al-Shar'  asked the cosponsors to condemn al-Dirani's kidnapping. What  reaction did that request have in Moscow, and have you conveyed  that request to Washington?    [Posuvalyuk] I have conveyed that request to Moscow.    [Correspondent] What was the reaction?    [Posuvalyuk] I conveyed that request to Moscow.    [Correspondent] What are the ideas you are proposing to give  an impetus to the peace process?    [Posuvalyuk] My theory is that if I start to talk about  these  details, I will erase the dividing line between the reporter and  the diplomat. There are reporters and there are diplomats.    [Correspondent] What are the general outlines of these  ideas?    [Posuvalyuk] The general line governing these ideas is that  after the parties concerned exchange the required basic  assertions, we can get into technical details. We believe that  we have reached the stage at which we can discuss technical  details, having discussed the general major principles.    [Correspondent] At the end of your tour you will visit  Israel. Have you promised Minister Buwayz to raise the issue of  al-Dirani's kidnapping in Tel Aviv to discuss ways to release  him?    [Posuvalyuk] I will talk to Israeli officials about the  obstacles that still hinder the peace process.    [Correspondent] You represent President Yeltsin and Russia,  who is a permanent member of the UN Security Council. You are  also one of the cosponsors of the peace conference. What is  your position on Lebanon's complaint against Israel and its  demand for the immediate release of al-Dirani?    [Posuvalyuk] As far as I know, the Lebanese request is still  under consideration.    [Correspondent] Is there not an official comment?    [Posuvalyuk] As far as I know, there has been no official  reaction. [end recording]</p>

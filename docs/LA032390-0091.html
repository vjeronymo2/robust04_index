			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> MONEY FOR HARBOR PLAN EXPECTED IN '90  </P> <P> Federal funding for a $6.5-million project to improve the safety of Ventura  Harbor's ocean entrance, called the most dangerous in Southern California,  could begin this year, a harbor official said.  </P> <P> "I believe we will be included in the 1990 budget," said Ventura Port District  General Manager Richard W. Parsons at a meeting Wednesday.  </P> <P> The harbor's entrance has been plagued, since its 1963 opening, with sand  deposits that sometimes create breaking waves for incoming vessels or imprison  them in the harbor.  </P> <P> Each year, the Port supervises a dredging operation to keep the entrance open,  this year digging out 200,000 cubic yards of sand at a cost of about $400,000.  On average, 640,000 cubic yards have been dredged a year over the past 17  years, with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers paying for most of the work.  </P> <P> Parsons said lobbying in Washington, D.C., by a delegation last month yielded  tentative approval of $750,000 in funding for engineering designs and test  models on entrance improvements, the first concrete step toward actual work on  the project.  </P> <P> If all goes well and there are no delays in funding, Parsons said, work could  begin in 1993.  </P> <P> The project, an outgrowth of an extensive Corps of Engineers study, will deepen  the sea entrance to Ventura Harbor from about 20 feet to about 40 feet.  </P> <P> It also will extend the offshore breakwater and the north jetty, plus add a  650-foot sea wall to the beach about 1,000 feet south of the harbor's south  jetty.  </P> <P> Last month, Ventura Port Commissioner Richard S. Hambleton called the entrance  "the most dangerous in Southern California" at a meeting of the House  Subcommittee on Water Resources. The subcommittee voted in favor of the  project, virtually assuring full committee authorization, Parsons said. JUDITH  HARLAN  </P></p>

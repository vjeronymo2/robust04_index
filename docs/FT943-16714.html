			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Outdoors: A rhythm restored - Gardening Half-term reports on this season have swung round and become positive: unlike investors, gardeners have had an excellent June. True, we had wind and, recently, great heat. The soil here has started to crack and the phloxes need watering. After three summers on fast forward, nature has slowed and returned to her English rhythm. From June 15 to July 10, it is roses all the way, relatively unspoiled by rain. If in doubt, plant the pink Rose Felicia, the pale pink climbing New Dawn and festoons of the rampant white Rambling Rector up trees or towards your neighbours. Gardening does not need to be complicated and I have tried to look back on the first half of summer through the eyes of a starter or self-improver who wants to be different without having a flop. One answer would be to brave the queues and go to next week's Hampton Court Show, open from July 6 to July 10 with first-class shopping on the spot from our main nurseries. Another is to cast around and react against the things which have caught my eye. I would start the long route upwards with particular shrubs, especially the pink-flowered Beauty Bush which is only held back by its name. Beauty Bush is bad enough, but the true Kolkwitzia is not everyone's party-talk. This year, it has been splendid and I doubt if even a half-hearted gardener could kill it. It grows in any soil, including clay, but is best of all on chalk. It is totally hardy and after three or four years reaches a height of 6ft or more. The flowers are a pale pink in profusion just before shrub roses are at their best. Twenty years ago, we were often short-changed by a shy-flowering form. It seems to have retreated and Beauty Bushes now flower their skirts off from the second year onwards. It pays to prune back all shoots which have flowered as soon as the petals have fallen. Otherwise, the bush tends to flower at the top and you have to make a virtue of its lop-sidedness, planting something like a blue michaelmas daisy for late summer. In early June, hardened gardeners fear the infamous June gap when the best of the tulips are over and the best of the irises and roses have not begun. Everything seems to hold its breath, what can we do about it? This year, nature covered the gap by holding up May-flowering shrubs in those awful gales and cold evenings. Late spring ran smoothly into summer, but even so, I was glad of my easy answer, the single-flowered white Rocket, which grows like a weed from packets of seed sown now for next year. It is listed as Hesperis and it is well worth the minimal trouble as it will even flower in those dry places beneath a hedge. It picks up from the point where connoisseurs might have seen their perennial forms of white Cardamine go over, leading into the easy white profusion of June and July. If you hate sowing seeds, think bigger and try one of my fool-proof shrubs which can be multiplied with the greatest of ease from cuttings. The white-flowered Rubus Tridel Benenden is quite a tall and broad customer, but it is outstandingly good in late May and I always relish the freshness throughout the year of its greencurrant leaves and darker stems which exude health. Make the most of it because breeders have now crossed it with purple-pink odoratus and the result is about to hit our garden centres. I cannot imagine that it will surpass Benenden, the ideal shrub for improving a rough bit of garden, the edge of a drive or one of those broad corners by a dark shed where nobody goes very often. You can prune it very hard after flowering, but it is spoilt if it has less of a width than 7ft or 8ft. If the Rubus seems too massive, hunt around at a height of 2ft for a grossly neglected cousin of the common old Flower of Jove. Many of us grow more of the magenta-flowered Lychnis than we ever intend because it seeds everywhere and springs up so rapidly. Too few of us try the old, soft Lychnis coronaria oculata, whose white flowers have the prettiest pink eye which fades with age. Anyone can grow this easy perennial which will split rapidly into dozens and will thrive in any sunny garden, however small, or in gaps between paving. Like the rest of the family, it likes sunshine, but the lower leaves will turn brown if it is constantly dry. It flowers for a month and a half. It was popular in the period which historians call early modern, but it is oddly unpopular nowadays, in what ancient historians think of as a dark age. It is amazing how quickly the gap closes between ambitious self-improvers and old gardens which rest on their laurels and hollies. My crowning memory of early June is a mischievous visit to Hidcote, between the bedding seasons at this famous Warwickshire garden in the National Trust. I was glad that the ticket was free and did not cost the usual Pounds 4.80. In early June, what was there, apart from the old hedges and some gorgeous blue meconopsis? Does anyone else grow a dusky pink Weigela called Conquete? The family is full of good shrubs, but many of them have flowers which are too sombre to show up well among the leaves. This one is much brighter: is it alive and available in what sounds like its native France or can we not reintroduce it from Hidcote's stocks? Meanwhile, you can compensate by hunting for some lesser-known old variety in the lists of Peter Beales or David Austin. This year, even on my rotten soil for roses, the surprise has been the rose-purple Ardoisse de Lyon. I love to think that these fine varieties have been totally forgotten in the France which first bred them. In England, we will soon be calling them heritage and making it impossible for any of them to go out of fashion.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (1): Global aims call for softer software - Comment: Companies seeking business in world markets are becoming aware that their plans must be backed up by an effective strategy in information technology THE globalisation of business is fast becoming a reality for large and medium-sized companies. Most large organisations expect by the mid-1990s to be doing business in more countries than they are today. For these businesses, the need to think globally while acting locally has become an imperative. Global operations have a number of advantages of which the most important is economy of scale. Fashion and taste are beginning to converge in all the world's major markets as a consequence of improved communications and media coverage. Global distribution and marketing brings the possibility of increased sales volumes without the need to duplicate research, development and production budgets. Many managers, however, would subscribe to the view that designing a successful international operation is a huge challenge. The trick is to strike an effective balance between central authority and local autonomy. Too much strength at the centre can result in a top heavy bureaucracy that inhibits flexibility and initiative at the local level. IBM is just one global giant struggling to overcome this difficulty. Give the local operations too much power, however, and fragmentation of purpose can destroy synergies and economies of scale. The world's motor manufacturers, for example, are only now beginning to scent success in their search for a 'world car' after years of trying. Local operations were too fond of designing models to suit only local needs. An effective global business strategy, moreover, must be underpinned by an effective global information technology strategy. Accurate and timely information provides a means of co-ordinating business activities worldwide and improving marketing. Devising a global information systems strategy, however, is a difficult trick to master. Some companies do not even try. A study carried out last year for the Amdahl Executive Institute revealed that 52 per cent of large companies rarely or never considered information systems in their global strategy development. Only 14 per cent of the companies canvassed always took information systems into account. Yet companies such as Unilever, featured in this issue of Software at Work, have clearly gained significant competitiveness from a level headed approach to internationalising their information systems strategy. In particular, Unilever understands the difficulty of transferring software between different countries and has applied pragmatism rather than technological fireworks. The company has laid down a limited number of hardware and software options all of which will work together in an open framework. The lesson is that 'softer' software - much easier to use than today's cumbersome code - is a prerequisite for global success. The advent of 'multimedia' (see pages 30-32) may offer less formal ways of ensuring transferability of software between different countries. Multimedia systems combine text, graphics, still and moving video images and sound. It is possible because once translated into the computer language of '0s' and '1s', all media are grist to the computer's mill. Compact disk drives provide the essential low-cost storage. As Philip Manchester points out, (page 30), multimedia has to date been a technology looking for an application. But the technologies which together constitute multimedia are no longer laboratory curiosities and new and practical applications are emerging almost daily. Apple, for example, claims to have systems that recognise continuous speech - without having to be specially 'trained'. So just as Apple's Macintosh technology and Microsoft's Windows 3.0 interface have made software packages much simpler to use, so at some point, multimedia techniques - which look like the best way of communicating complex information through a computer system - could ease the transportability of business software across national boundaries. But until that time, Unilever's example of hard-headed pragmatism will be the one to follow.</p>

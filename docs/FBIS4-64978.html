			<p>BFN     [Text] Canada's minister of fisheries, Brian Tobin, is  expected to present some tough measures today aimed at stopping  foreign overfishing off Canada's east coast. The minister is  expected to announce a plan that would allow Canada to make  arrests, levy fines, and confiscate vessels and fish catches of  crews who break the law by taking cod.    Overfishing by both foreign and domestic fleets is blamed  for  the near-extinction of northern cod and serious depletion of  other bottom dwelling fish in Canadian east coast waters. Mr.  Tobin is particularly upset about those foreign trawlers which  continue to catch tonnes of undersized cod while thousands of  Canadian fishermen and plant workers are paid not to fish in  Canadian waters.</p>

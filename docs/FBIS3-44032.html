			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [From the "News Brief" program]    [Text] [Presenter Patricia Glynn] The situation in Lesotho  is  reported to be quiet but tense today after a weekend of fighting  between army factions. We are joined now by a correspondent in  Maseru, Sara Hildebrand. Sara, welcome to you. You have been  through quite a weekend. How has the fighting affected you?    [Hildebrand] For me personally, well, it's very difficult. I  do sympathize with any the other people living in Lesotho with  young families. I've got two small children. There is  definitely a worry here about what to do. The are queues,  apparently, at the border with people leaving, and people coming  into Lesotho are being told they do so at their own risk.    [Glynn] But, the fighting over the weekend, was it in the  center of Maseru, or on the outskirts?    [Hildebrand] It was basically -- we have a hotel up on the  hill and it was certainly round the surrounding houses, and then  on the other side we have a place called [word indistinct] in  Thetsane where there was also shelling going on there, you know,  where people were really, literally, crouching under the tables  and there was just whistling over their homes. In fact my  gardener came in this morning to tell me he opened his front  door this morning to find two dead soldiers outside in the  garden.    [Glynn] What are the total casualties to date?    [Hildebrand] Well, it's very difficult to say. There have  been reports of two or three soldiers, which obviously, I think  that not actually accurate, as I've heard from various other  sources of people seeing seven soldiers at the side of the road,  and I think we are very unsure about that.    [Glynn] And the consensus of opinion now as to the cause of  the fighting -- are people still believing that it is the wage  issue?    [Hildebrand] I think it's sort of gone beyond that now. It  might have originally been that, but it's certainly between  these two rival factions. And again people are climbing on the  bandwagon here, the political seems to be getting involved as  well. [sentence as heard] We have the troops in the town who  are supposedly loyal to the government, and then those outside  who again may be [words indistinct] supported by the BNP  [Basotholand National Party].    [Glynn] We heard reports that South Africa's been requested  for troops to quell the fighting there. Do you have an update  on that situation?    [Hildebrand] I have been trying to get in contact with the  South African ambassador, but he's obviously in various meetings  at the moment, but he's promised to get back to me as soon as  possible.    [Glynn] And what about your plans? I mean, what's going to  happen today, for instance?    [Hildebrand] I think that's a very good question. We are all  waiting here, really. We are expecting it to start up again. I  mean, you know there's a lull at the moment but the soldiers are  all still out there. I think everyone has to make their own  decision about what they are going to do. Some areas have been  evacuated, those in the direct line of fire, and I know friends  of mine have now moved into the safer areas. I think we've just  got to wait and see how bad it's going to get. Certain people  have moved across the border already. I know the United Nations  have moved their people out. So, I mean, I think everyone had  to make up their own minds on this [ words indistinct].    [Glynn] And your bags are packed?    [Hildebrand] They are definitely packed and we are ready to  go, but we are sticking in here for the moment.    [Glynn] But Sara, are there any plans for negotiations, any  meetings planned for today?    [Hildebrand] I hope so, yes I do. As I say, I am waiting to  see that. Some people obviously are in meetings at the moment.  I know, for instance, the Lesotho Highlands Project is now  closed down. They just rang in to tell me that. The people are  being sent home.    [Glynn] Well, take care of yourself, Sara, and thanks very  much for joining us.</p>

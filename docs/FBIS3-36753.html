Otherwise the spring elections may  result in the revival of camouflaged Soviets, says Gaydar's  statement.    In the opinion of Gaydar, it is necessary to elaborate a  joint strategy for the election campaign in the next two or  three weeks.    It would be good to agree on the following principle: one  candidate of all democratic and reform forces to one mandate, he  said. Gaydar also suggested an agreement on quotas for each  regional reform organization as pre-election tactics. The  quotas can be based on the electors' support to democratic  electoral coalitions in regions. The principle can be made  all-Russian and then specified at joint consultations.    Gaydar is ready to insist on quotas in favor of new  progressive trade unions, business and workers' organizations  and independent professional candidates.</p>

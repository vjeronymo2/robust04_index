			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Thorntons 23% lower after poor second half A 20 PER CENT contraction in the chocolate market in those distant hot days of May and June finished off a poor second half for Thorntons, the chocolate maker and retailer. Pre-tax profit for the year to June 27 fell nearly 23 per cent to Pounds 9.2m (Pounds 11.9m) on sales up 5.5 per cent to Pounds 84.3m (Pounds 79.9m). With operating profit down by Pounds 1m at Pounds 10.4m, the pre-tax outcome was affected by increased interest costs of Pounds 565,000 (Pounds 241,000), reduced property profits of Pounds 148,000 (Pounds 713,000) and an exceptional charge of Pounds 824,000. Thorntons issued a profits warning in May following a disappointing Mothers' Day and Easter sales apparently disrupted by the election. Mr John Thornton, chairman, whose family owns 48 per cent of the shares, said the subsequent hot weather had 'destroyed chocolate sales'. Although the group's ice cream business had benefited, it was too small to offset the shortfall. 'The average ice cream sale is only 70p compared with Pounds 1.90 for chocolates, so the business has a long way to go.' But the company now aimed to expand the product range, possibly into drinks, to balance the portfolio whatever the weather. Other factors squeezing operating margins were the inexorable rise in high street rents, with an average of 11 per cent, and the VAT increase, which it decided to bear without putting up prices at a cost of Pounds 1m. The most buoyant area was the supply of chocolates to other retailers, notably Marks and Spencer. Commercial sales, including the doubling of ice cream from a small base, went up by 19 per cent to Pounds 14.8m. In France, where the group has 58 Martial shops compared with its 395 UK outlets, sales rose by 3 per cent to Pounds 8.73m and the loss was cut from Pounds 850,000 to Pounds 750,000. After maintaining capital spending at Pounds 7.8m, the group reduced net debt by Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 1.9m, gearing of less than 4 per cent. Exceptional charges comprised the cost of management pruning and property write-downs offset by the sale of a shop in the Champs-Elysees. Earnings per share declined to 9.9p (12.6p). A maintained final dividend of 2.4p makes a total of 3.65p (3.6p). COMMENT With Mr Thornton prepared to don garish clothing to promote the latest chocolate range, it is hard to fault the group's dedication to its niche. And the 'aspirational' tag attached to the Select range suggests that the company is rightly trying to push some higher-margin lines. However, it is a little disappointing that the much-invested-in factories have been unable to keep up with demand. Other niggles have a longer pedigree. After three years, the aspiration in France remains simply to cut the losses, and the weather retains a strange hold over such a refined product. That said, the group has achieved positive cashflow, a reform of management, increased advertising and advances in ice cream, all in a tough year for discretionary consumer spending. Pre-tax profit is forecast to recover to Pounds 11.3m this year, giving a prospective p/e of nearly 14. The market rating seems fair while the vulnerability to weather and a few treat-peaks (with Christmas next) make the niche a bit sticky.</p>

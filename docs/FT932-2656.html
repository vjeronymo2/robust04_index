			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Ticino (3): Circles of fortune - The economy PROMOTERS of regional economies love to illustrate the attraction of their territory by drawing concentric circles around it to show the size of the regional market. Few, however, are as lucky as those whose job it is to promote Ticino. Within a 70km radius of Chiasso there are 6m people. Extend the radius slightly further and the circle encompasses most of northern Italy, one of the most productive and prosperous areas in Europe. The exercise is also revealing, for Ticino's economy depends for its health to an extraordinary extent on various links with Italy. For most of the post-war period, those links have enabled the canton to build a standard of living that the majority of Italians can only dream of. Per capita income of SFr33,078 in 1990, while 20 per cent below the Swiss average, is well above that in most of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. Some 35,000 people cross the border between Italy and Ticino every day to work in the canton, providing about a third of the total workforce. About 10 per cent of the canton's exports go to Italy; most of the funds managed by Ticino banks come from Italy. Yet in the past couple of years things have turned somewhat sour as the economic effects of the upheavals south of the border have exacerbated a slump that was already hurting. Many Ticino companies, especially those in the important machinery and clothing sectors, depend on Italian industry for orders. The Ticino economy has a curious structure; it is based mainly on finance and tourism. Industry is relatively underdeveloped as is agriculture because of the largely mountainous terrain. While there are no official statistics, economists estimate that the canton's gross domestic product is in the vicinity of SFr10bn, of which industry accounts for roughly 20 per cent and construction another 20 per cent. Tourism accounts for about a quarter and finance the rest, except for a modest 2 per cent which comes from agriculture. Until the late 19th century, Ticino was a poor rural area, dependent on subsistance mountain agriculture. In recent decades, agriculture has declined drastically in importance, but farmers have become more productive, taking advantage of the semi-tropical climate to concentrate on market gardening and to develop a pleasant, if rather expensive, line of Merlot wines. The canton largely missed the beginnings of the industrial revolution, being effectively cut off from northern Switzerland where Brown Boveri and Sulzer Brothers established a pioneering engineering industry. But the opening of the Gotthard railway tunnel in 1882 changed things, providing the opportunity for Ticinese artisans to work on the tunnel project itself and later bringing entrepreneurs south of the Alps. Development proceeded slowly until after the Second World War when both manufacturing and the financial sector took off simultaneously. In both cases, development owed a lot to the canton's cultural and geographical proximity to Italy. In the case of manufacturing, the neighbouring Italian provinces of Como and Varese provided the cheap labour that attracted Swiss textile, clothing and metal goods producers to the canton. Even today, most of these companies are strung along the Italian border, facilitating commuting for the tens of thousands of workers who come in every day. 'Without the frontalieri, we could not have done it,' says Mr Franco Citterio, secretary of the Association of Ticinese Industries. Perhaps reflecting the Italian connection, most of the 500-odd industrial companies in the canton tend to be small, employing fewer than 100 people. It is difficult to think of a single Ticinese company that is a household name outside of the canton. The industrial structure is also characterised by a very high degree of foreign ownership. Mr Citterio estimates that half of the capital invested in industry comes from outside the canton, mainly from German Switzerland and Italy. In the past, the Ticinese have resented the significant Swiss-German presence. 'In the 1930s, they installed a sort of apartheid. There were only 10,000 of them, but they were in all the top places,' says Mr Raffaello Ceschi, a Ticino historian. In the past, the canton maintained its prosperity in difficult times simply by exporting its unemployment. When jobs disappeared, the authorities removed the work permits from the Italian frontalieri. Today, partly because of a change in Swiss laws, this is no longer so easy. Unemployment soared from an average of 1.9 per cent in 1990 to 5.3 per cent last year, the highest in Switzerland. At year end, there more more than 8,000 out of work. However, as Mr Dick Marty, the cantonal governor, points out, it is difficult to get too alarmed at this development. The fact that there are still 35,000 frontalieri coming in every day means that the 8,000 are not so desperate that they will take any job available. Indeed, it could be argued that the frontalieri are still taking the brunt of the burden. Officials estimate that the number of workers crossing the border every day has plunged from 40,000 to 35,000 in the past two years. Much of this fall is due to the slump in the outsize construction industry, where labour turnover is notoriously high anyway. Analysts doubt that employment will rise rapidly even when economic recovery comes because most companies feel an urgent need to improve productivity. The high value of the Swiss franc and high Swiss wage rates make it increasingly difficult for them to compete in world markets. Another source of anxiety is the rejection by Swiss voters last year of the European Economic Area (EEA). 'It is still difficult to see any impacts of the vote,' Mr Citterio says, but manufacturers fear increased red tape at EC borders. 'More than half of our output is exported and companies were already having difficulty before the EEA vote. Now they have to worry about discrimination as well,' he says. Yet another worry is the continuing political turmoil in Italy, which is the canton's second-most-important exports customer after Germany. As a result of the scandals, investment in the huge Italian public industrial sector has ground to a halt, resulting in declining orders for many Ticino machinery and chemical companies. There is not a lot that Ticino authorities themselves can do to promote industrial development. They have managed over the past decade to improve public finances so that tax rates are more competitive, and they have increased the amount of investment tax credits available for industry. Apart from that, the government is hoping that the project to build a new high-speed rail tunnel through the Gotthard pass will prove as beneficial as the original rail line a century ago.</p>

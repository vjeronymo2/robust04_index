			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Commission condemns Ciskei shooting AN INDEPENDENT commission of inquiry in South Africa yesterday condemned the 'indiscriminate and prolonged shooting' by Ciskei homeland troops which left 28 African National Congress (ANC) demonstrators dead after last month's march aimed at toppling the Ciskei government. Meanwhile the ANC confirmed last night it would return to constitutional talks following the summit between President F W de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela. The inquiry, headed by Judge Richard Goldstone, also strongly criticised ANC leaders, saying their actions were irresponsible and deliberately placed the demonstrators in imminent danger which resulted in death and injury. Mr Goldstone recommended that the ANC leadership publicly censure those of its officials who were responsible. The Ciskei massacre, which also left one Ciskei soldier dead (ballistics evidence showed he was shot by his own side), provoked a serious political crisis which was only defused after substantial concessions from the South African government to the ANC. Mr Goldstone said in his report that Ciskei's claim that its soldiers were shot at by the demonstrators was not probable. He added: 'Indiscriminate and prolonged shooting at innocent demonstrators is morally and legally indefensible and is deserving of the strongest censure. 'When the crowd in that area turned to flee. . .the continued and prolonged firing was quite unjustifiable and unlawful,' he said. He recommended that criminal charges be brought. The report said the action by a communist party leader, Mr Ronnie Kasrils, in leading a group of demonstrators through a gap in a fence and toward soldiers hidden in long grass 'was the immediate cause of what followed'. The 36-page report will put pressure on President F W de Klerk to ensure that homeland governments, which Pretoria funds and whose security forces it largely controls, permit free political activity. The report argues that reasonable and negotiated mass demonstrations should be tolerated anywhere in South Africa, including the nominally independent black homelands.</p>

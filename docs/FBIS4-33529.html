			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Belem do Para (Brazil), 7 Jun (EFE) -- Dominican  Republic Foreign Minister [title as received] Juan Aristides  Tavares said today that his country should not be blamed for the  failure of the blockade imposed on Haiti by the international  community.    In a speech to foreign ministers of OAS member countries,  whose 24th General Assembly is taking place in the Amazonian  city of Belem Do Para in northern Brazil, Tavares said that many  countries are wrong to blame his country for the failure of the  sanctions imposed on the Haitian military regime.    Although he admitted that the Dominican Republic believes  the  embargo imposed by the OAS and the United Nations is an "unjust  and inhuman" sanction, the Dominican foreign minister said his  government strives to comply with international agreements.    OAS and UN observers sent to Haiti argue that the border  between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, which share the Island  of Hispaniola, is the most vulnerable point of the economic  blockade imposed by the international community to force General  Raoul Cedras to relinquish power and allow President  Jean-Bertrand Aristide to return to that country.    "We defend the embargo despite considering it unjust and  inhuman," Tavares said as he reaffirmed that the government in  Santo Domingo has made several efforts to close its border with  Haiti. The Dominican foreign minister added that the political  party of President Joaquin Balaguer, who is seeking reelection,  lost the elections in all border provinces because the  deployment of more than 12,000 soldiers to the region "has made  life impossible for the area's inhabitants," he added. Tavares  said surveillance operations along the more than 300-km-long  border of abysses and mountains has consumed a large amount of  resources that should have been targeted to social investments.    "Ever since it was promulgated, the embargo has been  ineffective and has been constantly violated by countries that  continue to do business with Haiti; it is unfair to blame the  Dominican Republic for the failure of sanctions against Haitian  soldiers," Tavares said. "It has been suggested that the  failure was caused by my country's attitude toward the  sanctions, and that is not so. If the embargo failed it is  because of the attitude of those countries that continue to do  business with Haiti," the Dominican foreign minister added.  [passage omitted]</p>

The minutes are published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin and in the Board's annual report. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the pace of economic expansion, though still substantial, may have moderated somewhat recently, while resource utilization has remained at high levels. Nonfarm payroll employment continued to advance at a robust pace in July, but the civilian unemployment rate edged up to 6.1 percent_about the same as the average for the second quarter. Industrial production rose appreciably over June and July. Growth in consumer spending has slowed in recent months, owing in part to constraints on the supply of motor vehicles. Housing starts rose in July. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to a continued strong expansion in spending on business equipment; permits for nonresidential construction have been rising as well. Business inventories registered a large increase in the second quarter, but inventories appeared to have remained broadly in line with sales. The average nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was larger in April and May than the average for the first quarter. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices have remained moderate in recent months, apart form the effect of short-run swings in volatile food and energy components. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most market interest rates are unchanged to up slightly on balance since the July meeting. The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was unchanged on balance over the inter-meeting period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> M2 and M3 turned up in July following declines on average in both aggregates over May and June; for the year through July, M2 and M3 grew at rates slightly above the bottom of their ranges for 1994. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent months. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994. The committee anticipated that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases could persist during the year and that money growth within these ranges would be consistent with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1995, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set the associated monitoring range for growth of domestic nonfinancial debt at 3 to 7 percent for 1995. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the committee seeks to increase somewhat the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible increase in the discount rate. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> By order of the Federal Open Market Committee, October 4, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Donald L.

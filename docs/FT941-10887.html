			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / US airlift to aid Sarajevo war victims US aircraft yesterday ferried medical staff into Sarajevo and evacuated civilians injured in the city's worst massacre since fighting started there 22 months ago, agencies report from Sarajevo. The death toll from Saturday's mortar bomb attack in the Bosnian capital rose to 68 as some of the more critically wounded died. As United Nations armoured vehicles collected patients from city hospitals, the UN refugee agency said well over 50 injured were expected to leave, including some hurt in earlier incidents. In Germany, meanwhile, preparations were made at a US military hospital to receive nearly 100 wounded from Sarajevo - 50 in a US Air Force transport aircraft and 48 on board a Red Cross aircraft. A US medical team flew in to Sarajevo on a Hercules transport aircraft earlier yesterday to assist local doctors in preparing for the evacuation. The Bosnian government declared a day of mourning, while families laid flowers at the market place in memory of the dead. Most of the damage had been cleared but blood still lay in some shrapnel holes. Sarajevo Mayor Muhamed Kreselvjakovic said: 'This was the worst day of death in this city for 500 years.' Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnian president, appealed to world leaders to help save Moslems from 'slow-motion genocide'. He blamed Serb gunners for the attack, in which about 200 were wounded. The Bosnian Serbs, denying responsibility for attacks on Friday and Saturday, have accused the Moslems of massacring their own people to scupper peace talks. The UN said experts, analysing the market crater, had been unable to determine who fired the single 120mm mortar bomb. Peace mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg were last night due to meet Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. The Bosnian Moslems said they would still attend peace talks in Geneva on February 10. Lord Owen said on his arrival in Belgrade yesterday that he wanted to get an agreement to put Sarajevo under UN control even if he could not achieve an overall settlement to the war in Bosnia. Mr Karadzic had indicated that the Serbs had been ready to 'discuss a demilitarisation of Sarajevo under UN administration', Lord Owen said. 'What we are really trying to do is get a settlement in Sarajevo even if we can't get an overall settlement,' Lord Owen added. Earlier, Lord Owen said he had a 'glint' of optimism that Sarajevo could be put under UN control as a result of the mortar attack.</p>

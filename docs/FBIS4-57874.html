			<p>BFN     [Text] Economy Minister Ignacio Posadas did not want to  give an opinion on whether the executive branch will veto the  "interpretive law," which will permit a 6 percent salary  increase, retroactive to 1 January, for employees and teachers  at the University of the Republic. With his usual directness  and without concessions, the minister indicated that the  responsibility for the salary increase does not lie with the  executive branch and he criticized those who are pressuring  Congress during an election year to obtain benefits.    "The executive branch has had to say no to salary demands,  not only from the university but other sectors too, basically  due to two factors: Because it does not have the money and  because the Constitution wisely prevents the granting of salary  increases in an election year in order to avoid demagogic  pressure and weaknesses," the minister said.    He stressed that the interpretative law prevents this  unconstitutionality and provides the resources. "Anyway, I  believe there is nothing good in pressuring Congress during an  election year in order to obtain salary increases," Posadas  stressed.    When he was asked if the law would be viable if it provides  the resources, the minister said: "All of this undoubtedly means  a greater sacrifice for the people."    He did not wish to guarantee whether the executive branch  would veto the "interpretative law" if it is approved today in  the Chamber of Deputies and finally promulgated. "I am part of  the executive branch, but I am not the executive branch; so let  us see what is resolved," he said.    Posadas added that the executive branch is not authorized to  disperse funds to serve this type of demand. "In these matters  arguments are always used that are not in keeping with reality.  It is said: We defend the university, which is being attacked  by the executive branch. The executive branch does not attack  the university, and this (conflict) is definitely not being  carried out to defend the university. These are people who are  asking for higher salaries (and) this is not a bad thing, but it  is the truth. To make a big uproar to defend the university is  somewhat conspicuous," he said.    "There is definitely not much heroism in this because who is  going to pay? Those who are making the demands -- of course  not; you (the taxpayers) are going to pay because now we  complete the vicious circle: The executive branch has no money  in its pockets, it has no money of its own. If they oblige it  to pay more, well then the executive branch is going to take the  money from you; there is no other way," he emphasized.    When he was asked how conflicts such as the university  conflict are resolved, he said: "The solution to conflicts must  come from those who create them because here we have another  very curious thing: A conflict is generated and then they go and  ask the other party how to resolve it; (the conflict) was not my  idea."</p>

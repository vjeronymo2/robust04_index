			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller by Ruediger </F> Moniac; place and date not given: "Ciller: Clear the  Misunderstandings"]    [Text] Bonn -- Almost two weeks after the beginning of the  mammoth trial against 13 occupiers of the Turkish Consulate in  Munich, some 3,000 people participated in peaceful  demonstrations in Munich and Duesseldorf on Saturday [23 April]  against the deportation of Kurds and German arms supplies to  Turkey. In Munich, 2,000 demonstrators followed the call of the  Alliance Against Racism. Kurdish women and children with flags  and posters gathered for a demonstration in Duesseldorf that was  registered as a "children's festival." Several hundred police  were in action in both cities. In an interview with DIE WELT,  Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has meanwhile commented on  the basic issues of the conflict.    [Moniac] Attacks have been carried out against Turks -- your  fellow countrymen -- in Moelln, Solingen, and now also  Bielefeld. Prime Minister, what do you think of that?    [Ciller] After the attack of Solingen we asked the German  authorities to clearly condemn such brutal acts of hostility  against foreigners, and to protect Turks living in Germany  against assaults and to take the guilty ones to court. It is  not acceptable for foreigners to be confronted with such  assaults. For more than 30 years, my fellow countrymen have  lived and worked in Germany, having become part of society  there. They have contributed to society in social, cultural,  and economic terms. This is why they expect to be able to  continue to live in peace there.    [Moniac] How do you intend to refute accusations according  to which Turkey is using German arms, the further supply of  which has meanwhile been stopped by Bonn, against the Kurds.    [Ciller] Turkey has emphasized that German military aid is  being used in line with the agreements concluded with the  Federal Government. Any claims of misuse are absolutely  unfounded and have been intentionally concocted by certain  groups to impair Turkish-German relations. We hope that the  Federal Government will remove the issue from German politics,  which seems to be influenced by the election campaign atmosphere  these days.    [Moniac] Can Turkey do without German arms?    [Ciller] We are interested in continuing constructive  cooperation with Germany and other NATO members in the military  sphere. It is of great benefit for both sides and for NATO as a  whole. Yet, one should not forget that competition in the  armament market is stiff and that Turkey is not dependent on a  single source as far as military goods are concerned.    [Moniac] How should German arms exports be stimulated again?    [Ciller] The initiative lies with the Federal Government,  whose members we appreciate highly. We hope that, within the  framework of long-standing Turkish-German friendship, the  Federal Government will not be influenced by certain groups that  want to impair our relations.    [Moniac] Does the Turkish Government also have instruments  to exert pressure?    [Ciller] We are not intending to exert pressure. Our  objective is to clarify the misunderstandings. Everything else  lies within the responsibility of German authorities. It is  true that we have to take public opinion in Turkey into account.  Nevertheless, we are convinced that our Turkish-German  friendship will drive away the clouds above our relationship.    [Moniac] The first Kurds holding Turkish passports have been  deported to Turkey. Can you guarantee that they will neither be  tortured nor executed?    [Ciller] Turkey is a democracy based on the principles of  law and order with unrestricted respect for human rights.  Turkey is a member of various international institutions for  the prevention of torture and mistreatment. Such acts are also  defined as major crimes by the Turkish Penal Code. As far as  claims that deportees are threatened with capital punishment in  Turkey are concerned, I would like to say the following: Under  Turkish law, such sentences have to be ratified by parliament.  Since 1984, the Turkish Parliament has not ratified a single  case of capital punishment, which is why death sentences have  not been carried out. Besides, application for asylum in  another country is not a punishable act under Turkish law.  Therefore, these persons will not be subject to criminal  persecution in Turkey for having filed an application for asylum.</p>

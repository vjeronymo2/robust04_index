			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following review of the 19 April  issue of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic in  nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Al-Azhar Rector, Scholars Address Islamic Action  Conference    2. Awqaf Minister, Ulema Answer Students' Questions    3. Government Spends 200 Million Pounds on Mosques    4.

Jordanian Scholar Views Islam, Terrorism  <H5>  AL-AZHAR RECTOR, SCHOLARS ADDRESS ISLAMIC ACTION CONFERENCE </H5>   An approximately 2,000-word report on pages 1 and 11 reviews  statements made at the Islamic Action Conference, Present and  Future, organized by the Islamic Universities League in  cooperation with the al-Azhar Mosque. Addressing the  conference, Al-Azhar Mosque rector Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali  Jad-al-Haqq exhorts Muslims to "discard their dogmatic disputes,  solve their problems, and build themselves" so they can take  their place in "the new world order." He notes that divisions  among Muslims would lead to destructive wars and negatively  affect Muslim minorities in the world. He wonders if the  Islamic nation is capable of confronting the "external and  internal intrigues designed to sow dissension between the  peoples and their governments." Al-Azhar University Vice  President Ja'far 'Abd-al-Salam says that what is meant by  Islamic action involves all deeds, writings, and moves aimed to  teach the Islamic religion and spread Islam so that it will have  the upper hand in the Islamic countries. He notes the  importance of Islamic action in the media, particularly  satellite media, to "spread true Islam" and dispel the "deviant  image" of Islam. The media, he says, can do the job that Muslim  armies did in the early days of Islam to propagate this religion  worldwide. Dr. Muhammad Kamal, head of the Shari'ah College at  Alexandria University, warns of the danger of Western  information media organs, which convey a "distorted image of  Islam and Muslims and oppose any attempt to correct it."  Al-Azhar University professor Ibrahim 'Isa calls for an Islamic  preparation of the education curricula in the Arab and Islamic  countries. He warns against introducing foreign education  curricula because non-Islamic curricula would "entrench the  divisions and disarray" among the Arab and Muslim countries and  "threaten their identity."  <H5>  AWQAF MINISTER, ULEMA ANSWER STUDENTS' QUESTIONS </H5>   A 500-word report on page 2 elaborates on a gathering at the  Law College in al-Minufiyah University between an enlightenment  convoy led by Awqaf Minister Mahjub, a number of al-Azhar ulema,  and some students. Al-Minufiyah Governor Counselor 'Adli Husayn  says that there are "serious phenomena" in Egypt that need  debate. He stresses that the youths are living in a time in  which the cards have been shuffled, noting that the state should  heed and answer their questions. Responding to a question from  a student who notes that there are those who maintain that Egypt  is an atheist state because it does not apply Islam, a  psychology professor at a Cairo university says that the most  serious menace is the sedition the extremist factions are trying  to foment. He says that they "raise the slogan of Islam to  subvert Egypt and strike at Islam." He urges the students to  reject the extremists' ideas because their aim is to kindle  sedition and not to promote Islam. On the stance of the state  and al-Azhar on hostile trends, al-Azhar Mosque scholar Sayyid  Sa'ud says al-Azhar is assailed because it refuses to condone  the extremists's actions. He notes that al-Azhar will not serve  certain ideology, noting that these extremists realize the  influence and role of al-Azhar and that is why they assail it.  <H5>  GOVERNMENT SPENDS 200 MILLION POUNDS ON MOSQUES </H5>   A 50-word report on page 2 cites Awqaf Minister Mahjub as  saying that the government this year allocated $200 million  pounds to build and renovate mosques throughout Egypt. He says  that the government will spare none of the funds necessary to  make the mosques look befitting the lofty status of Islam and to  "purge them of extremism."   <H5>    'AQIDATI CONVOY SCHOLARS EXPLAIN ISLAMIC VIEWS </H5>   The paper features an approximately 2,200-word report on  page  4 on 'AQIDATI enlightenment convoy's visit to the city of  al-Dakhilah in al-Wadi al-Jadid. In a seminar attended by a  large number of the city's inhabitants, al-Azhar scholar Sabri  'Abd-al-Ra'uf stressed that Islam has "nothing to do with  terrorism" and that killing innocent people is rejected by  Islam. The "evil faction" that does this seeks to "destroy the  homeland," he says. 'AQIDATI Chief Editor al-Sayyid  'Abd-al-Ra'uf argues that when youths' issues are broached, we  can find no authority or system better qualified to address all  aspects of life than Islam. Dr. Haykal says that the "backbone  of youths" in Egypt are the "al-Azhar youths." They are  responsible for learning and teaching Islam. They are the  safety valve of society, who are qualified to dispel the calls  for extremism that threaten the nation. On women's work, Dr.  Haykal says that there is no verse in the Koran that bans  women's work, but, he notes, Islam exhorts women to dress and  behave decently. Answering a question on the need for the 1  billion Muslim population to have a befitting standing in the  world, Dr. Ibrahim al-Matnawi notes that an Islamic awakening is  currently growing worldwide but "malicious enemies" are trying  to make it a bloody awakening. He notes that there is great  hope that the Islamic nation will unify its ranks and regain its  strength.  <H5>  WRITER URGES AWQAF TO ALLOW PREACHERS FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION </H5>   In a 500-word comment by Basyuni al-Halawani in the "With  All  Frankness" column on page 6, he notes that during President  Mubarak's era writers began to enjoy without fear a great deal  of freedom of expression. Certain people criticized the state  of affairs in the Awqaf Ministry to the minister himself, he  says, adding that others criticized Egypt's religious symbols  and establishments. He calls on the Awqaf Ministry to allow  preachers to express their views freely and creatively and not  to repeat mundane and banal sermons so that they may "win  credibility" and fight the wave of extremism with "enlightened  Islamic thinking."  <H5>  WRITER SLAMS U.S., UN, NATO INACTION IN GORAZDE </H5>   In a 550-word comment titled "No Condolences in Gorazde" on  page 10, Majdi Salim says that the Serbs advanced on Gorazde  with Russian support, but the United Nations, America, and NATO  did nothing to stop them. "The Serbs and Russians act, but the  United States, NATO, and the United Nations just talk, " he  argues. It seems, he says, that the mission of the UN forces in  Bosnia is to protect the UN observers and watch the tragedy but  not to protect Gorazde's 60,000 Muslim population from the  carnage.  <H5>  JORDANIAN SCHOLAR VIEWS ISLAM, TERRORISM </H5>   In a 2,000-word undated interview with Shaykh 'Abd-al-'Aziz  al-Khayyat, former Jordanian awqaf minister and vice president  of the Royal Academy of the Islamic Civilization in Jordan, on  page 20, he answers questions on topical Islamic issues. He  says that the majority of silent Muslims favor moderation, which  is advocated by Islam. He notes that Islam has nothing to do  with the acts done by groups that have "deviated from Islam's  moderation and tolerance," and have resorted to violence.  Discussing recent dialogues on religions between Christian and  Muslim scholars, he says that these dialogues helped to clear  the image of Islam. He notes that the Vatican instructed the  clergy to denounce campaigns against Islam, notably Salman  Rushdie's book "The Satanic Verses." He says that the conflict  between Islam and Communism ended with the demise of Communism  and disintegration of the Soviet Union.</p>

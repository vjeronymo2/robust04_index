			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DISGRUNTLED POSTMAN GOES ON SHOOTING SPREE; 3 SLAIN;  </P> <P> ESCONDIDO GUNMAN IS BRAIN DEAD  </P> <P> A disgruntled mailman today shot his wife to death, then drove to a nearby post  office in Escondido and opened fire on fellow employees, killing two and  wounding a third before putting the gun to his head and shooting himself.  </P> <P> The rampage, which began at 7:30 a.m. on East Valley Parkway on the eastern  edge of the northern San Diego County city, left postal workers scrambling for  safety. When the gunfire subsided, survivors were seen exchanging hugs and  crying quietly.  </P> <P> Police said the gunman, identified as John Merlin Taylor, 52, of Escondido,  apparently was prepared for a siege of the postal facility, but there was no  indication that he was looking for a specific person or a target.  </P> <P> "He fired well over a dozen rounds, and there are expended cases all over the  floor there," Escondido Police Lt. Earl Callander said. "There is also a box of  about 100 rounds that apparently was going to be used for reloading."  </P> <P> Taylor was taken to nearby Palomar Memorial Hospital, where he was placed on a  life support system and declared brain-dead shortly after 10 a.m.  </P> <P> U.S. Postal Service spokesman Ken Boyd said Taylor had been a letter carrier  for 25 years and was nearing retirement. Taylor's boss described him as a model  employee, "as mellow and  </P> <P> </P> <P> Increasing Pressure  </P> <P> Police said they knew of no motive for the shootings and believed that the  victims were shot randomly, but co-workers said Taylor had succumbed to  increasing pressure at work.  </P> <P> Two days ago, co-worker Johnny Sims recalled having a discussion with Taylor in  which the mailman mentioned the 1986 shooting rampage at the post office in  Edmond, Okla.  </P> <P> "I think what may have happened is that we were talking about that thing that  happened at the Oklahoma post office," said Sims, who was not at work when the  Escondido shooting erupted.  </P> <P> "We were talking about something and got around to saying, 'What if something  happened to one of the employees that would have gotten him mad and to go  berserk?' " Sims added. "We were just joking around."  </P> <P> The Edmond shootings, which stunned the nation and is still much talked about  by postal workers who feel that the U.S. Postal Service is insensitive to its  employees, occurred when part-time mail carrier Patrick Sherrill massacred 14  co-workers, wounded six others and then committed suicide. Sherrill apparently  had been seeking revenge on his bosses.  </P> <P> Another co-worker, who declined to be identified, said he saw Taylor leave work  Wednesday night. He said Taylor seemed upset at the huge volume of mail he was  supposed to process.  </P> <P> "He said he was going home early because 'there's not enough mail here,' " the  co-worker said, adding that Taylor's remark was clearly facetious because  "there was a ton of mail there."  </P> <P> The same co-worker described Taylor was a "mellow, easygoing guy" who would  routinely get to work half an hour early and join two other employees on a  picnic table next to the loading dock for coffee each morning.  </P> <P> At 7:35 a.m., however, Taylor arrived at work and approached the same picnic  table and shot the two co-workers with a .22-caliber semiautomatic handgun,  killing both, police said. The names of the victims were not immediately  released by police.  </P> <P> Escondido Police Sgt. Blaine Bennett said Taylor then walked inside the back of  the post office and shot a co-worker through the arm. The victim, identified as  Paul Michael DeRisi, was taken to Palomar Memorial Hospital, where he was  listed in stable condition.  </P> <P> Bennett said another co-worker, Phyllis DeVito, injured herself when she fell  during a mad scramble to flee the building. DeVito also was taken to the  hospital but was expected to be released this afternoon.  </P> <P> Post office manager Bob Henley said he was in his office when he heard shots  and saw one employee bleeding from the shoulder.  </P> <P> Henly said he saw Taylor walk toward him and then point a gun his way.  </P> <P> He said Taylor told him: "I'm not going to shoot you" and then fired in another  direction. Henley said he "went back in and closed my office door, and I called  911."  </P> <P> Postal worker Reginald Keith said he was in a custodial room when he heard the  shots.  </P> <P> William Karlson, who saw Taylor walking inside the building, recalled: "He  didn't have any emotion. He was stern-faced. He walked right by me. He was  walking toward the end of the building with the gun in his hand."  </P> <P> About the same time that the shootings occurred, police received a call to go  to Taylor's residence several blocks away.  </P> <P> Escondidio Police Chief Vincent Jimno said that Taylor's wife, Liz, was found  lying in bed with her clothes on and that the covers had been pulled halfway up  as though she had been asleep. There were initial fears that Taylor might also  have shot his son, but a check of his home revealed that the boy was safe.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> UNITARIAN CHURCH TO PRESENT 'ROE V. WADE'  </P> <P> The Unitarian Church of Orange County will host an informal reading of "Roe v.  Wade," an original script by congregation member Ruth Shapin, at 10:30 a.m.  Sunday at the church facility in Anaheim.  </P> <P> The play describes the history behind the precedent-setting 1973 legal case, in  which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that women have a constitutional right to  abortion. That issue is now back for review before the U.S. Supreme Court.  </P> <P> "Unitarian women were very active in giving their support to the two women  attorneys who first brought the case to the courts," said Rosalie Abrams, a  church member and founder of the Orange County Feminist Repertory Theater.  </P> <P> The play is based on the book, "Roe v. Wade" by Marian Faux and is directed by  Abrams.  </P> <P> "Mother's Day is a very important time to say something important about  motherhood, that is, that we should be mothers by choice. We should have the  option of having babies when we want them and can take care of them," she said.  </P> <P> The church is at 1120 W. Santa Ana St., Anaheim.  </P></p>

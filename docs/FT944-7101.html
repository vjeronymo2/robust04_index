			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Oslo to plug oil tax loophole Norway yesterday announced a controversial plan to plug a loophole in the petroleum tax regime which it says has cost state coffers losses estimated at NKr300m (Pounds 28m) a year in inflated profit repatriation by foreign oil companies. The state accuses oil companies of boosting profit repatriation by building up debt in their Norwegian subsidiaries and offsetting the financing costs against local taxes. The finance ministry proposal would require the companies to maintain their equity capital at a minimum of 20 per cent or be penalised by higher taxes. The so-called 'thin capitalisation rule' will be retroactive to the beginning of 1994 if it is approved by parliament. 'The proposition means that a higher equity capital share than 20 per cent will have consequences for taxation since the rights to deduct net financial costs will be limited in proportion to a maximum debt ratio of 80 per cent,' the ministry said.</p>

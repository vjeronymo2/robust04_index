			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Labor Minister Juan Sifontes said the International  Labor Organization (ILO) agrees with the Labor Code reforms  presented by the government.    The minister said that Arturo Bronstein, chief of the  Legislation Section of the ILO headquartered in Geneva, sent him  a letter dated 20 December describing the reforms as "important  advances over the current Labor Code."    In the letter, Bronstein stressed that "the reforms follow  the draft recommended by the ILO to a great extent." These  reforms were made known in the "Forum for Economic and Social  Consensus" formed by government, labor, and private enterprise  sectors.    The ILO had recommended two changes to Articles 211, 214,  and  228 dealing with the protection of union founders.  Nevertheless, the minister explained that those articles  referred to the "promoters," not the founders, as a result of  which Bronstein expressed his total acceptance of the draft.    The Labor Ministry presented the Labor Code reforms to the  Legislative Assembly at the end of 1993. The ILO's support of  the reforms are in addition to the favorable report on labor  rights issued by the U.S. Commerce Department.    The reforms were made in response to intense pressure from  the U.S. Government, which threatened to suspend the Generalized  System of Preferences under which some Salvadoran products are  exempt from import duties. Some say that the ILO is dependent  on U.S. trade unions interested in promoting trade unionism in  the Third World.    Many analysts believe the new code might reactivate labor  agitation in the country and block the reconstruction process.    Salvadoran union leaders have accused the government of  breaking the "consensus" by presenting the draft reforms,  indicating that they do not agree with some points.  Nevertheless, the Legislative Assembly will have the last word.</p>

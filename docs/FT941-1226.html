			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (17): A letter from Professor Rontgen - Siemens of Germany is a many sided company. On this page Andrew Baxter examines its role in health and power equipment. Since supplying X-ray tubes to their inventor in 1897, Siemens has become one of the world's largest medical engineering groups - and plans to keep its dominance In November 1897, the company that is now Siemens' medical engineering group received a letter from Professor Wilhelm Rontgen, discoverer of X-rays. Its X-ray tubes were very good, he said, but could he have them for DM20 each rather than DM30? 'From experiences I have made elsewhere this proposal should be quite acceptable, since it is an exceptional case and you might perhaps be interested in further orders from my side,' he wrote. Nearly a century later, the Siemens business is one of the largest in the medical engineering field worldwide, with sales of DM7.9bn in 1992/93 and about 30,000 employees. It also has the broadest product line, ranging from computed tomography (CT) scanners that fill a room to cardiac pacemakers and hearing aids. But the pressures on producers of medical equipment have intensified. As with other fast-developing technologies such as personal computers, customers for high-technology medical equipment bought by hospitals and universities expect more performance for the same or lower prices. A DM1m scanner could be priced at DM600,000 a year later. The Siemens medical engineering group has traditionally been global, with factories in the US and 10 other countries, besides Germany. Five of the 14 product divisions are based in the US and two others in Sweden. But Germany, where the group employs 13,000 people, still accounts for some 40 per cent of its workforce and the company is committed to conserving the considerable investment it has made in its domestic base. Last year, it announced a DM85m investment to transform its plant at Forchheim, near its base in Erlangen, into one of the most modern medico-technical manufacturing facilities in the world. The plant already assembles angiography systems, and will be expanded to produce CT scanners from later this year. But the shake-up will also involve moving all the functions of the two businesses to the factory, from product development through to marketing. The combined laboratory, office building and manufacturing plant is expected to deliver a big reduction in the number of manufacturing hours per system along with shorter lines of communication between departments to accelerate product development. Significantly, Mr Werner Maly, chief executive officer of the medical engineering group, said the changes represented an important part of the productivity programme with which the group would compensate for the disadvantages of maintaining its operations in Germany - high costs and, more recently, currency depreciation. At the same time the investment is intended to capitalise on the advantages of manufacturing in Germany, notably the country's highly qualified workforce. Some of the many other changes underway or being planned within the medical engineering group illustrate the importance not only of reducing costs but also responding to customers' changing needs as they bear down on the costs of health care. In the magnetic resonance imaging division, Mr Thomas Miller is planning a big shake-up of everything from organisation to manufacturing - for a product that was not even on the market until 1982. Mr Miller, who became general manager nearly two years ago, says the division is world-class for a 'classical' engineering company but not for a modern one. A weighty tome on his desk, The Plan, maps out the future for the division. A classic functionally-oriented hierarchy is being thrown out in favour of a process-oriented structure. This followed a successful experiment at Erlangen in manufacturing coils - a key component that amplifies the electro-magnetic signal from the human body - which put all those involved into a group and produced coils faster and cheaper. Mr Miller comments that the excellent training and competence of the workforce had increased the barriers between different functions. 'But if you can break down the barriers, the potential is even greater,' he says. Strategically, the company is looking very hard at the advantages of changing from being manufacturer of MR systems to an integrator, allowing it to put more emphasis on core competences - the ones on which customers decide which company's system to buy - and outsourcing everything else. On the engineering and product development side, teamwork is replacing the former very linear product design process, while by 1996, engineering and manufacturing will be brought together under one roof in Erlangen. The factory is currently three kilometres away but might as well be in China, says Mr Miller. The aim will be to have a single assembly line producing multiple products, thus responding to an expected proliferation of MR products. The overall plan is aggressive, Mr Miller admits, but his target of doubling profitability in five years, even if revenues fail to rise, is 'absolutely achievable', he says. In the CT division, the move to Forchheim is viewed as an important development by Dr Rolf Hupke, marketing manager. The closer links between departments will bring further improvements in product development times and in manufacturing times, he says. The division also wants to be in a good position to offer more frequent upgrades of products, in line with customers' demands, rather than announce a big bang every five years. Consequently, it is taking a more modular approach to product design. Other changes also reflect the changing nature of the market place. The research and development department is now aiming at developing what is needed rather than what Dr Hupke calls the 'best of the best,' and products are being designed with specification tailored to market needs, to reduce the cost. The division's latest Somatom AR range is the first to be developed on a design-for-cost basis, and it is also designing machines so that installation costs are reduced and service intervals extended. The result, says Dr Hupke, is that the overall cost for the customer has been reduced dramatically. The clear link between cost reduction and business success is also apparent in the group's lithotripsy products, which use shock waves to treat kidney stones and gall-stones. Over the past two and a half years a 'cost-half' programme has reduced the price of these machines to below DM1m. The price cut will 'open up the market,' says Mr Wolfgang Feindor, executive director of the lithotripsy, urology and surgery division and the Rontgen systems division. The programme has involved new attitudes in R&amp;D groups, and a new organisation which has swept away walls between R&amp;D and manufacturing. Significantly, by cutting development times on new products from five years in the 1980s to two years, more money is released for spending on marketing. Part of the programme has involved getting the message over to employees about costs.</p>

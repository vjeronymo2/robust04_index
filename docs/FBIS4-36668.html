			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Souleimane Nimer] </F>   [Text] Mayfa'ah, Yemen, June 12 (AFP) -- Northern Yemeni  forces are closing in on the home turf of southern leader 'Ali  Salim al-Bid and were Sunday posted 55 kilometres (33 miles)  from the port city of al-Mukalla in Hadhramaut Province.    It was the first time since the civil war broke out five  weeks ago that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's troops were  reported to be in Hadhramaut, with the fighting so far centred  around Aden and Shabwah provinces.    Al-Bid, who declared a breakaway southern state on May 21,  has been based in his home town of al-Mukalla for several weeks,  after moving from his political headquarters in the southern  port of Aden.    UN peace envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi was Sunday headed for  al-Mukalla to meet al-Bid, after visits to Sanaa, Amman, the  Saudi city of Jeddah, and Muscat.    "Our forces are ready to mount an assault on al-Mukalla  within 48 hours, once we have received the order from the  military command in Sanaa," Colonel 'Abdallah 'Aliwi told an AFP  correspondent in Mayfa', west of the port.    The first northern lines were around 55 kilometres (33  miles)  from al-Mukalla, in a mountainous a?ea overlooking the coastal  town of Burum on the Arabian Sea. Another officer said the  forward positions were established Thursday night.    The two sides fight artillery duels and southern warplanes  carry out raids over the northern army posts, he said.    Three soldiers were wounded on Saturday as shells crashed  around 20 metres (yards) from an army escort for journalists  touring the region. Northern units hit back with rounds of  artillery fire.    "If the southern bombardment keeps up, we will be forced to  resume our advance toward Burum and al-Mukalla," said Colonel  'Ali Haydar Salih, head of the army's 5th Brigade which was  fortifying its positions.    On the road from 'Ataq in the neighbouring oil province of  Shabwah and Mayfa'ah, northern troops have total control.    But the route was filled with craters, which northern  officers said were caused by southern air raids. The empty  casings of anti- aircraft rockets littered the sides of the road.</p>

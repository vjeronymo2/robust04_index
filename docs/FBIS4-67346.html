			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 16 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- In recent  years river channels inside and outside Beijing have suffered  from human-made destruction and serious pollution. Therefore,  some experts have time and again warned relevant departments and  citizens that because there is a serious shortage of water  resources and pollution is getting worse, many river channels on  the outskirts of Beijing have silted up.    The River and Lake Management Section of the Beijing  Municipal Water Resources Bureau revealed that former Beijing  Mayor Chen Xitong personally inspected the Erdao channel in  Jintailu last year. This channel was called a "present-day  dragon beard ditch" [meaning the channel was full of residue].  He immediately instructed the relevant department to improve  the situation. In a week the dregs were cleared but the channel  stilted up again the following week. It was learned that the  river water passing through this channel was for the Beijing No.  1 Thermal Power Station to generate electricity. The silt in the  channel caused by pollution threatened the normal operation of  the power station. Once the relevant department dredged up some  tree branches, foam plastics, bicycles, three-wheeled carts,  dead pigs, and dead dogs from a silted-up section of the channel.    Pollution similar to this is not rare in Beijing. Some  experts said that apart from industrial pollution, the most  threatening is human-made pollution. Most of the 175-km long  river channels on the Beijing outskirts are clean in the upper  portions, green in the middle, and black in the lower reaches.  Protecting water resources, which are seriously in short  supply, has become an urgent task for Beijing.</p>

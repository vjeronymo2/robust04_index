			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: AEG sees sales of DM90m from high-energy battery AEG, Daimler-Benz's loss-making electrical and electronics subsidiary, expects annual sales of DM90m (Dollars 58.4m) from a new high-energy battery when full production starts in 1998. Mr Frank Dieter Maier, the director responsible for a pilot production project launched in Berlin yesterday, said the aim was to seize a leading position in the new market for electrically-powered passenger cars. AEG aims to sell 15,000 of its sodium/nickel-chloride batteries in 1998, when laws come into force in California under which 2 per cent of car sales must be emission-free vehicles. Full production capacity - on a site yet to be selected - would cost several hundred million D-marks, Mr Maier said. Capacity of the DM20m pilot project, set up to perfect automated manufacturing processes, will be 450 batteries a year. He claimed the power units, developed in a joint venture with patent-holder Anglo American, the South African conglomerate, had three to four times more capacity than conventional lead-acid batteries, and gave a range of up to 150km in town traffic. Reviewing the financial situation at AEG, Mr Georg Stockl, chairman, said turnover had risen 7 per cent to DM6.4bn in the first eight months of the current year. However, incoming orders were up only 1 per cent compared with the same period of 1993. While he forecast that the heavily-restructured business would start showing operating profits next year, a net profit could not be expected until 1996. The railways business in particular was suffering from falling prices caused by over-capacity. It had booked 12 per cent more new orders in the period to the end of August, but still needed to close one of its four German plants and reduce its workforce by a third. Overall order intake rose 1 per cent in the period, confirming the ZVEI industry association's recent complaint that German electrical and electronics companies had yet to benefit from the economic recovery.</p>

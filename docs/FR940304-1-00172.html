Such performance standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would result in energy consumption of the eight appliances to total an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated 379.4 quads of primary energy over the 1996&hyph;2030 time period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Savings would be 64.1 quads, and the net present value would be an expected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $108.7 billion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  As noted at the beginning of this section, none of the alternatives that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were considered for these products would save as much energy as the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> c. ``Takings'' Assessment Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12630 (53 FR 8859, March 18, 1988) directs that, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing a regulation, an agency conduct a ``takings'' review. Such a review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is intended to assist agencies in avoiding unnecessary takings and help such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies account for those takings that are necessitated by statutory mandate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of the Order:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Policies that have takings implications'' refers to Federal regulations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed Federal regulations, proposed Federal legislation, comments on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed Federal legislation, or other Federal policy statements that, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented or enacted, could effect a taking, such as rules and regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that propose or implement licensing, permitting, or other condition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements or limitations on private property use, or that require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dedications or exactions from owners of private property. <FOOTCITE>48</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 48 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12630, March 15, 1988, Sec. 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are three parts of the appliance standards program that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conceivably could be viewed as having ``takings implications.'' These are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing and certification requirements, the impacts of standard levels, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible DOE testing of products for validation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to the first part, namely, testing and certification, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department believes that such a requirement, implementing a long-established  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory mandate in a manner calculated to minimize adverse economic impacts,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not constitute a ``taking'' of private property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, the Department's possible validation testing does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitute a ``taking'' within limitations described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lastly, the impact of standards could be viewed by some as a ``taking.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nevertheless, the Department believes that while an energy conservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard may limit some manufacturers in the range of appliance efficiencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they can produce, such narrowing of the energy efficiency range does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitute a ``taking'' in the sense described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In short, in none of the three parts of the appliance standards program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does the Department believe that the provisions of Executive Order 12630  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pertain.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> d. Federalism Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987) requires that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations or rules be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If there are sufficient substantial direct effects, then Executive Order 12612  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires preparation of a federalism assessment to be used in all decisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved in promulgating and implementing a regulation or a rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department finds that today's proposed rule, if finalized, will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have a substantial direct effect on State governments. State regulations that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may have existed on these eight products were preempted by the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards established in the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act. States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could petition the Department for exemption from such preemption, and none has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> done so. Today's Final Rule has no added effect on States. Thus, based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the foregoing, the Department finds that the preparation of a Federalism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment for this rulemaking is not warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Aspen falls 20% to Pounds 923,000 ASPEN Communications, the USM-quoted specialist print, communications and media services group, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 923,000 for the six months to June 30. This compared with profits of Pounds 1.15m at the interim stage last year and with Pounds 1.7m at the December 1991 year end. Turnover for the period rose by almost Pounds 1m to Pounds 28.9m. Mr Henry Meakin, chairman, said turnover in each division was increasing again and profits for both the second and third quarters of this year were showing healthy improvements against 1991. New business levels were higher than a year ago, he added. Earnings per share were 4.6p (5.6p) and an interim dividend of 2p (2.7p) is declared. However, the directors anticipate that the total dividend for the year would be no less than the 4.9p paid in 1991.</p>

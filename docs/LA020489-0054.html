			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMNIST MISSED MARK WITH CABLE 'GLITCH'  </P> <P> If Scott Ostler (Jan. 23) bothered to call Century Cable, he'd know that the  broadcast of a TV theme song and an anti-Semitic remark over the Super Bowl  audio was not a "glitch" from the local cable company, as he wrote, but pirate  broadcasters illegally tapping into the audio signal.  </P> <P> It bothers me that Ostler should rate an offensive anti-Semitic statement as  being of so little consequence that he was able to forget about it in the  pursuit of a cute lead. That's pretty sloppy. It also makes me wonder if he  agrees with those slugs. To me, his editorial omission indicates his tacit  assent.  </P> <P> LEE SCHNEIDER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

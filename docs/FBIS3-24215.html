			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Teslenko: "Lazare Kaplan Project </F> Discussed in Moscow: The Yankees Want To Fortify Their Position  in the World Raw Diamond Market"]    [Text] This week  the lively discussion of the proposal by the New York firm,  Lazare Kaplan International, to grant the Russian government a  loan of 3.3 billion dollars for 10 years on the security of raw  diamonds continues (KOMMERSANT wrote about this on 23 February).  The president of Lazare Kaplan, Leon Tempelsman, made a short  visit to Moscow from 25 February through 1 March. All his Moscow  meetings were strictly confidential. But the editorial office of  KOMMERSANT managed to gather some information regarding the  position of the interested parties and to determine that final  negotiations are planned for mid-March.    The precedent of large loans secured by diamonds was created  in 1990: the DeBeers firm loaned the USSR government 1 billion  dollars for 5 years on the security of 14.6 million carats in  raw diamonds. Only certain details of the liquidation of the  loans are known: payments are made under a special schedule four  times a year and by the end of 1995 will total 1.25 billion  dollars. After that the Ministry of Finance received a whole  number of such proposals. Some of them have already been  rejected and some are still being considered. In accordance with  existing practice, all negotiations in this field were strictly  confidential. But in the case of Lazare Kaplan International  (LKI), there was an information leak and the American firm's  proposal began to be discussed extensively throughout the  diamond world.    In Western business circles, it is commonly thought that the  purpose of Lazare Kaplan International's proposal is to prevent  an excessive flow of jewel-grade diamonds out of Russia by  transferring the entire federal reserve to the United States.    But according to KOMMERSANT experts' opinion, with its  proposal LKI is demonstrating the serious intention of North  American capital to launch a power play in the world raw diamond  market: to drive a wedge in DeBeers' delicate relations with  Russia, squeeze them out of the market, and free up a niche for  Canadian diamonds (industrial production of these diamonds  amounting to 5-7 million carats a year is expected in 3 or 4  years). The participation of the large firm DuPont de Nemour and  the American branch of the mining company VNR is possible in  this project.    In any case it is quite unlikely that the Russian Federation  government will accept LKI's proposal. In mid-March the deputy  minister of finance, Anatoliy Golovatyy, plans to conduct final  negotiations with the LKI leadership and make a counter proposal  which is more modest in parameters, for example, a 5-year loan  of 1 billion dollars on the security of raw diamonds worth 1.2  billion dollars, on the condition that the specialists of  Komdragmet [Committee on Precious Metals and Precious Stones]  make up the specifications and there is a commission of 0.1  percent; Mr. Tempelsman will most likely reject this proposal.  But then the Yakut government and the Almazy Rossii-Sakha  company will apparently continue separate negotiations with LKI  on a loan of 300 million dollars on the security of 3-4 million  carats in raw diamonds from their own reserves. If the federal  authorities do not take a sharply negative stand on this issue,  an American-Yakut agreement can be expected by the summer (the  start of the navigation season).    As of today, the interested parties upon whom realization of  LKI's deal with the federal government depends take the  following stands:    The Group of Experts of the Russian Federation  President    "We have no instructions on the LKI proposal," the leader of  the group, Viktor Krivov, reported yesterday. Most likely if the  group is hired to analyze this proposal, its experts will take  the finding prepared by the Ministry of Finance and Komdragmet  as a basis.    Russian Federation Ministry of Finance    After Boris Fedorov's resignation, Anatoliy Golovatyy became  responsible for preparing the text of the decision. He let it be  known that there are "respectable, well-known banks" behind the  LKI proposal, but it is a "raw" one. According to information  from other sources in the Ministry of Finance, two provisions in  the LKI proposal are absolutely unacceptable: the enormous  amount of the security and the high commission to Mr. Tempelsman.    Mr. Golovatyy emphasized that the possible loan secured by  diamonds "in no case should violate the agreement with DeBeers."  "Whatever agreement there may be, it must be fulfilled," he  stated.    Russian Federation Committee on Precious Metals and  Precious Stones    "This is an unacceptable proposal," announced the deputy  chairman of Komdragmet, Leonid Gurevich. It is interesting that  2 years ago Mr. Gurevich was a supporter of diamond security and  during his time as a member of the parliamentary committee on  foreign investments vigorously promulgated Western banks. But  recently his opinion did an about-face. According to his  assertion, this happened "as a result of new guidelines in the  diamond strategy of Russia, which today has more effective means  of using raw diamonds on international markets in its arsenal."    Administration of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia)    In the accompanying letter to Boris Yeltsin attached to the  text of the LKI proposal, the president of Yakutia, Mikhail  Nikolayev, not only showed fundamental interest in this idea but  even formulated four additional points. Taking into account  persistent efforts to return some of the diamonds from the  federal storage facility to the republic or receive part of the  money from transactions with them, Yakutia's interest in federal  loans secured by diamonds becomes completely clear.    As KOMMERSANT found out from circles close to the Russian  Ministry of Finance, Yakutia is hoping to receive around 10  percent of any "diamond" loan which the federal government  decides to take out. Moreover, Yakutia will be able to insist on  an increase in the internal Russian quota for exports of raw  diamonds through the DeBeers channel.    The Almazy Rossii-Sakha Company    "The company does not have instructions from the federal  government to provide a conclusion on the LKI proposal," said  the executive director of the company, Sergey Ulin. It is not  impossible that such instructions will be given in the near  future, since the company specialists, in particular advisor  Valeriy Rudakov, participated directly in preparing the security  agreement with DeBeers and has valuable experience in ongoing  diamond security transactions. Obviously, a state loan secured  by diamonds meets both the company's tactical (increasing the  internal quota on exports) and strategic interests.    DeBeers    "LKI informed the DeBeers management of the essence of its  proposal but does not act on DeBeers' instructions," reported  the LKI representative, Robert Keshmia. Most likely the  president of LKI discussed the possibility of hiring DeBeers  specialists to make up the security specifications with the  DeBeers executives. But there were no public announcements on  DeBeers' part.    Obviously, the DeBeers management is facing a dilemma:  either  free Russian reserves with LKI's help, and if the security  agreement is violated buy up the diamonds and thereby increase  its own reserves which are already burdensome (according to  information of the newspaper BUSINESS DAY, they are estimated at  3.4 billion dollars), or refrain from any participation in this  deal and reconcile itself to the "diamond drain from Russia"  which it believes exists.  <H5>  Description of Lazare Kaplan International </H5>   Lazare Kaplan International was founded in 1903. It  became a public company in 1972, the only diamond firm in the  United States whose stock is quoted on the stock exchange.    LKI is a sightholder of DeBeers, participates in a  joint advertising campaign for prestigious diamond jewelry, and  jointly with DeBeers is realizing a project in Ghana on the  Bayrim River.    LKI concluded the fiscal year which ended on 31 March  1993 with a sales volume of 150 million dollars, which is 4  percent higher than the result of the preceding year. The sales  volume in cut and polished diamonds totaled 43 million dollars,  but in March-May dropped by 30 percent. In the next half year,  which ended on 30 November, the total volume of sales grew by 32  percent, although cut and polished diamond sales fell by another  6 percent. The volume of sales of raw jewel-grade diamonds rose  by 48 percent in the second half year, which allowed profits of  1.1 million dollars to be obtained.  <H3>  Basic Provisions of the LKI Proposal (According to  Information from the Western Press: Reuters, WALL STREET  JOURNAL, BUSINESS DAY, and others): </H3>    -  LKI is undertaking to organize a loan for Russia in the  amount of 3.3 billion dollars for 10 years at 6 percent annual  interest;    -  raw diamonds worth 4.5 billion dollars function as security  and  are removed from the federal storage facility in Moscow by  representatives of the creditor;    -  in the event Russia violates  the obligations, the diamond security or part of it will be sold  through the Central Marking Organization (a trade subdivision of  DeBeers);    -  for the deal LKI acts as the foreign advisor of the Russian  government and receives 1.5 percent of the total amount of the  loan plus costs and consultation fees (in all about 50 million  dollars).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Chairman Li Ruihuan  of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference (CPPCC) met here this afternoon with  diplomatic envoys from five European countries.    At the invitation of the governments of Finland, Sweden,  Norway and Denmark and the Chamber of Representatives and the  Senate of Belgium, Li will pay official goodwill visits to the  five countries from May 2 to 21.    During the meeting, Li and the diplomats exchanged views on  the furthering of China's ties with these five countries.    Li expressed thanks to these countries for their careful  arrangements of the visits.    "This will be the first trip to Europe by a CPPCC chairman,"  Li told the four ambassadors and one minister-counsellor, saying  he is looking forward to the visit and the contacts with leaders  of the five governments and parliaments as well as peoples of  these countries.    The visit is aimed at enhancing mutual understanding,  expanding exchanges and strengthening cooperation between China  and the five countries, he noted.    China and these countries maintain good ties, which have  been  furthered in the past few years. High-level contacts have been  on the rise and the economic, trade, scientific and  technological cooperation and cultural exchanges have borne new  fruit, he said.    The two-way trade volume between China and the five  countries  has increased by a big margin, he added, voicing the hope that  potentials be tapped to further expand trade and economic  cooperation.    The five countries have plenty of advanced science and  technology and management expertise that China should draw from,  he said.    China and the five countries have no conflicts of  fundamental  interests and share much common ground on the maintenance of  peace and promoting common development, he noted.    China is ready to further develop its ties with the five  countries on the principles of seeking common ground while  reserving differences, mutual respect, non-interference in each  other's internal affairs and equality and mutual benefit.    "The CPPCC is willing to make new efforts for the promotion  of the existing friendly ties between China and the five  European countries," he said.    Denmark Ambassador to China William Friis-Moller expressed  his welcome to Li's visit on behalf of the five countries'  diplomats.    The visit has drawn attention from the governments and  peoples of the five countries, he said.    He expressed the hope that the visit will deepen mutual  understanding, promote the development of bilateral ties and  provide a chance for the five governments and parliaments to  know more about China.</p>

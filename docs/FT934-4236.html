			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Sterling and shares make gains as markets look for rate cut London shares, sterling and gilts all rose again yesterday on hopes that the government would cut interest rates soon. Investors took the view that, even with the tax rises and spending cuts unveiled on Tuesday in the Budget, UK growth next year was likely to be higher than some parts of Europe which are struggling from recession. The firm trends were helped by strong rises in equity markets in the rest of Europe, cuts in interest rates in France and Spain and indications that the Bundesbank was preparing for a further easing in monetary policy. Continuing the favourable reaction to the Budget, the FT-SE 100 index gained 10.3 to close at a record 3,234.2, a 123-point gain on the week. Although Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will come under pressure in the next few weeks to allow a cut in banks' base interest rates from 5.5 per cent, the pound performed well on expectations of relatively high UK economic growth. Sterling climbed 1 1/4 pfennigs to close in London at DM2.565, a gain of more than 3 pfennigs on the week. Against the dollar, it put on nearly 1 cent yesterday to finish at Dollars 1.4905, and was little changed in New York. Prices of long-dated gilts rose  1/4 point, for a 3-point gain on the week. The market believed inflationary forces would remain weak and that the lower government borrowing requirement would reduce the need for bond sales. Investor sentiment on the continent was boosted by the Bundesbank's decision on Thursday to cut its 'repo' rate, which determines money market interest rates, to 6 per cent from 6.25 per cent for the next five weeks. That triggered a  1/4 percentage point cut in the French intervention rate to 6.2 per cent and a cut in a key Spanish money market rate to 9 per cent from 9.25 per cent.

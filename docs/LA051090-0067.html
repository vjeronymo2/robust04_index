			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A THIRD OF VALDEZ SPILL AREA STILL OILY  </P> <P> Oil still fouls one-third of the beaches hit by last year's Exxon Valdez spill,  according to reports Wednesday by the oil company and federal officials.  </P> <P> Oil was found on 358.3 miles of shoreline during a survey of 1,062 miles of  beaches struck by oil last year in Prince William Sound, the Kenai Peninsula  and Kodiak Island, Exxon said in a progress report to federal and state cleanup  coordinators.  </P> <P> Most of the shores are lightly oiled.  </P> <P> An assessment by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration supported  the Exxon analysis even though the numbers differed slightly, apparently  because Exxon was faster than the government in processing data sent in by  beach survey crews, said Burl Wescott of the NOAA.  </P> <P> Alaska spill coordinator Randy Bayliss said the state had no dispute with the  findings of how much oil remained.  </P></p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, The Netherlands (2): Tougher times ahead - The economy CLOSE trading ties with Germany have so far enabled the Netherlands to stave off the blow of recession which has struck most Anglo-Saxon economies. Germany's own struggle to finance unification may have helped push up Dutch interest rates and the cost of living but, on balance, the Netherlands has fared well by the dismantling of the Berlin Wall, an event which has had the important effect of making its biggest trading partner even bigger. However, the Netherlands, like Germany, has not been able to bask in a post-unification glow. After several years of enjoying Europe's lowest rate of inflation and highest rate of job creation, the country faces harder times ahead as the cost of living rises and the pace of economic growth grows. Official projections by the semi-official Central Planning Office show that recession will be avoided but economic statistics make clear that the boom years of the late 1980s are well and truly over. At the same time, the Netherlands faces the formidable task of meeting the convergence criteria for Economic and Monetary Union (Emu) which were drafted at the Dutch-hosted Maastricht Summit of EC leaders in December 1991. Although the country's financing deficit is falling steadily, the government's overall indebtedness remains well above Emu standards and inflation continues to be a problem. Dutch officials are confident that the Emu targets can be met but success will depend ultimately on the government's ability to rein in spending. The open, export-orientated nature of the Dutch economy also means that developments in the Netherlands hinge crucially on the robustness - or otherwise - of world trade. The Netherlands exports a full 60 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP) in the form of goods and services. This percentage is rivalled only by Belgium and is well ahead of the proportion of exports achieved by key industrial countries such as the US, Japan and Germany, whose exports account for between 10 and 30 per cent of GDP. This reliance on exports can be a double-edged sword, causing difficulties in times of stagnant world trade and bringing benefits when international commerce is more buoyant. In 1991, in any case, exports were a boon to the economy, accounting almost single-handedly for the overall economy's growth at a time when domestic consumption was virtually flat. Exports by volume (excluding oil, natural gas and other forms of energy) rose by 5 per cent in 1991 and are forecast to show a further gain of 4.5 per cent this year. Overall economic performance was less strong, however, with the rate of growth in GNP falling to 2 per cent from 4 per cent in 1990. Forecasts for 1992 vary, but most economists are projecting rates of between 1 and 2 per cent. The importance of Germany is reflected in the fact that exports to the Netherlands' powerful eastern neighbour were up 12 per cent last year. What's more, Germany accounted for an even larger percentage of Dutch foreign trade than normal, absorbing 30 per cent of all Dutch exports compared with 28 per cent the year before. Some economists note that the 12 per cent rise in exports to Germany is lower than that of, for example, Denmark (which had a 21 per cent rise) or Italy (whose exports to Germany jumped by more than 15 per cent.) They also argue that Dutch exports to Germany are heavy on horticulture and foodstuffs but light on value-added industrial goods. However, Mr Wim Duisenberg, president of the Dutch central bank, argues in his 1991 annual report that 'The relatively lower rise in exports to Germany does not imply that their effect on the overall economy was more limited than in other countries. Because of the relatively large share of German exports in (Dutch) GDP, this contribution to economic growth in 1990 and 1991 was bigger than all other EC countries with the exception of Belgium, which saw a slightly higher contribution.' Horticulture, the biggest single component of Dutch agricultural exports - themselves a powerful motor behind the domestic economy - has indeed been the main beneficiary of the tearing down of the Berlin Wall and the opening up of East European markets. Exports to Poland and other former Soviet bloc countries of Dutch hothouse-grown products such as tomatoes have soared by nearly 1,000 per cent from, admittedly, the very low levels seen in the communist era. The union of former East and West Germany has meant that the enlarged country now absorbs 52 per cent of all Dutch foreign horticulture sales, up from 48 per cent in 1990. Thanks in large part to the Netherlands' traditional role as the world's third-biggest agricultural exporter after the US and France, the country produced a Fl 18.5bn current account surplus in 1991 and economists forecast further increases in 1992 and 1993. The continued rosy picture of the Netherlands' external economic relations is in sharp contrast to the state of the government's finances. Despite steady progress in cutting the financing (or budget) deficit, the state's overall indebtedness is still huge, putting it in the same league as Belgium and Italy. Total government debt is equivalent to 80 per cent of GDP, well above the 'Emu reference level' of a maximum 60 per cent. However, government projections show that the indebtedness ratio will have fallen to 76.5 per cent by 1994, enabling the Dutch to meet an alternate stipulation that debt must be showing a sufficient decline to put it on target to reach the reference level at 'a satisfactory pace'. The Dutch financing deficit is less of a problem because it is forecast to fall to 2.4 per cent of GDP by 1994, compared with 3.75 per cent in 1991, enabling the Netherlands to fulfil the Emu norm of 3 per cent. Dutch long-term interest rates, currently at around 8.75 per cent, are comfortably within the EC range, but inflation is more problematic. After boasting the lowest rate of inflation in the EC from 1987 to 1990, the cost of living shot up to 3.9 per cent in 1991 and has exceeded 4.0 per cent during most of 1992. At these levels, Dutch cost of living increases do not meet the Emu criterion that a country's cost of living may not be 1.5 points higher than the three best-performing EC member states. The rekindling of Dutch inflation is only partly the result of imported inflation from Germany. In fact, about half of the recent increases can be attributed to government policies such as increases in state-controlled rents and higher environmental levies on fuel. Mr Wim Kok, the Dutch finance minister, has undertaken to get inflation below 3.5 per cent, putting the Netherlands within range of the Emu criteria. His efforts will be bolstered in October by a planned one-point reduction in the upper-band rate for value-added tax (VAT), to 17.5 per cent from 18.5 per cent. He has vowed that the reduction will have no effect on the 1993 budget, scheduled to be unveiled on September 15.</p>

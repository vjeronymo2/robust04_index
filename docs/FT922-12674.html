			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: Trade Indemnity under pressure as Dutch insurer enters market HEIGHTENED competition for the trade credit insurance custom of the UK's biggest companies is on the cards following the entry into the market yesterday of Nederlandsche Credietverzekering Maatschappij (NCM), the Dutch export credit insurer. The news will bring further pressure to Trade Indemnity, the trade credit insurer, whose 82 per cent plus market share could come under threat. NCM, which has previously traded in the UK from its Dutch base, established a new UK subsidiary, NCM Credit Insurance, following its purchase of the privatised Insurance Services Group last December. A dominant force in Dutch domestic and UK and Dutch export credit insurance, NCM now intends to establish a sizeable market share in the UK domestic market. 'We haven't entered this market to be a marginal player,' said Mr Colin Foxall, managing director and chief executive. NCM hoped eventually to offer domestic credit insurance to many of the 6,000 UK companies to which it already sells export credit insurance. 'We are entering the market because our customers have pressed us to do so,' added Mr Foxall. 'One third of our customers already buy domestic credit insurance. We'd expect that large numbers would want at least a quote from us.' NCM said that it hopes to expand principally by selling to companies that are currently uninsured. 'We want to raise the awareness of the usefulness of the product,' said Mr Foxall. No more than 7 per cent of GDP is insured in the UK, compared with as much as 20 per cent in the Netherlands, Mr Foxall said yesterday. Even so the new competition could spell problems for Trade Indemnity, which has a had a tumultuous time in the past two years. The company has been hard hit from claims as a result of the recession and last month announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 46.6m for 1991, compared with Pounds 28.8m in 1990. The group passed its dividend last year. A decline in its share price from 93p last March to only 45p at yesterday's close has wiped out more than half the group's market capitalisation. NCM claims that its package is 'unique' in the UK. Claimants face no waiting period and payment is effected immediately upon ascertaining insolvency. Liability is based on the amount owing under the contract, not the amount accepted in the insolvent estate, and recoveries are calculated from the date of insolvency and not from the date of notification.</p>

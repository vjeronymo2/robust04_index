			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Power station to go ahead SCOTTISH Hydro-Electric, the privatised electricity generator and supply company, and Norweb, the regional electricity supply company, are to build jointly a 660MW gas-fired power station at Keadby, south Humberside. The companies yesterday completed financing for the Pounds 400m station, which will open in January 1995. New power stations such as Keadby, which will be buying gas from British Gas, have faced opposition since gas prices were increased by about 15 per cent to 20 per cent in September. Critics said this meant the projects would produce expensive electricity, which regional companies would then sell to captive domestic customers. Mr Malcolm Faulkner, Norweb's managing director, said Keadby would supply competitive power. He said the high price reflected flexible supply terms. Only about 60 per cent of gas will be supplied by British Gas. Mobil Gas Marketing will be another supplier. The Keadby station will use the latest turbine technology. John Brown Engineering, which will build the station, said the deal was its largest order of its type from the UK. A UK, US, and Japanese consortium will build a Pounds 230m 660MW power station on the Isle of Grain in Kent. TBV Power, which is jointly owned by Tarmac and Black and Veatch, a US construction company, will join Marubeni, the Japanese trading company, to design and build the station. The government should triple or quadruple its target for introducing renewable energy such as wind, wave and solar power, according to a report from MPs the Commons energy select committee yesterday.</p>

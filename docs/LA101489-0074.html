Tropical Storm Jerry, which was  spawned by a tropical depression off the coast of Mexico, had top winds of 70  m.p.h. and was located about 580 miles from New Orleans, the National Hurricane  Center in Coral Gables, Fla., said. Forecasters said that the high tides could  result from the rough seas caused by the storm as well as the strong  gravitational pull of the moon.  </P></p>

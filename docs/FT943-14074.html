			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Taiwan woos foreign banks Taiwan has relaxed restrictions on the establishment of offshore banking units (OBUs) in a bid to attract more operations and to help promote syndicated loan business in the local market. Foreign banks can now apply to set up an OBU without first having established a branch in Taiwan, an official at the finance ministry's bureau of monetary affairs said yesterday. Applicants need not be among the world's top 500 financial institutions as before. 'They only need to prove they have prudential management, a good business plan and the means to operate in Taiwan,' the official said. The minimum capitalisation requirement has yet to be decided, but will probably be NTDollars 80m (Pounds 1.9m). Taiwan currently has 38 OBUs, 19 of them run by foreign banks.</p>

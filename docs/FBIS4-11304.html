			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 21 Apr (PL) -- Approximately 160 members of  the Cuban community living in the United States arrived today in  Havana for the Nation and the Emigrants Conference to which they  were invited. The conference will begin tomorrow and last until  Sunday in the Convention Palace in Havana.    The group traveled by charter flight directly from Miami and  immediately went to the Comodoro Hotel, on Havana's west coast,  where they will be lodged and where the accreditation offices  are.    Organizing commission sources told PRENSA LATINA that the  recent arrivals will join the approximately 100 people already  registered to take part in the meeting.    Even though the official list of participants has not yet  been published, the sources said it includes former politicians,  businessmen, journalists, intellectuals, and leaders of Cuban  organizations who live in more than 40 countries.    The invitations were individually addressed and were  distributed by local authorities, who took into account the  views of the country's social and mass organizations, according  to official reports.    The conference was summoned by Foreign Relations Minister  Roberto Robaina on 14 February. One of its purposes is to  "examine measures for normalization of emigrant links with the  Cuban nation, Cuban institutions, and Cuban families."    The conference is an opportunity for Cubans living abroad to  present, in good faith, their legitimate wishes and concerns,  Robaina said. Nevertheless, he said there would be no  "possibility for political manipulations or opportunities for  those who wish to intervene in affairs that are the sole concern  of those who live, work, and struggle in the fatherland."    Unofficial reports state the meeting will be inaugurated  tomorrow with a special intervention by Robaina himself. Other  important officials, including Ricardo Alarcon, parliament  president; Carlos Lage, vice president of the Council of State;  and Abel Prieto, president of the Union of Writers and Artists,  will brief participants on topics crucial to life in Cuba. The  closing ceremony is expected on Sunday afternoon, when the  conference results will be made public.</p>

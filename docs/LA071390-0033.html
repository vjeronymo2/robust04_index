			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> IP GOES ON TRIAL IN FATAL SHOOTING  </P> <P> A prosecutor described the death of a 15-year-old boy last summer as "a  drive-by shooting" during the first day of the murder trial of Roger Sing Ip on  Thursday. Ip, 33, of Spring Valley, is accused of killing Kurt Yokes of La  Jolla on July 10, 1989.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregg McClain called the crime "senseless," and said it  occurred after a near-collision between the vehicle in which Yokes was riding  and Ip's car.  </P> <P> Ip's attorney, William Fletcher, told Superior Court jurors and Judge Herbert  Exarhos that the incident occurred after Ip counted the receipts at the Pacific  Beach restaurant he co-owned, and carried the money and a weapon to his Isuzu  Trooper.  </P> <P> Fletcher said Ip's car and the other car nearly collided about 11:30 p.m., and  "the female driver extended her middle finger to the driver of the Isuzu  Trooper."  </P> <P> Ip looked sternly at the occupants, but did not say or do anything, Fletcher  said, and another remark was made by another passenger in Yokes car.  </P> <P> Ip followed the car because he wanted to talk to the occupants about the  "disrespect shown to him and the community" with the angry exchanges, Fletcher  said.  </P> <P> "In his culture, when an individual is disrespectful, you talk to that  individual. At no time did he think of harm or any violent act," said the  defense attorney. Ip is Chinese and was born in Hong Kong.  </P> <P> Fletcher did not discuss the shooting itself, but said that Ip drove from the  scene not knowing that someone had been killed or injured. "Mr. Ip learned  through the media . . . that Mr. Yokes had been killed," Fletcher said.  </P> <P> McClain said Ip left the county and tried to get a passport from the British  consulate. Ip is a British subject. However, he returned to San Diego about 2  1/2 weeks later and surrendered at the courthouse.  </P></p>

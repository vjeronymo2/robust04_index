Attending the  session were Chen Xitong, Li Qiyan, Zhang Jianmin, Wang Daming,  Li Zhijian, Chen Guangwen, and 47 members and 10 alternate  members of the municipal party committee. Attending as  observers were members and alternate members of the party  Central Committee and members of the Central Discipline  Inspection Commission, who were from Beijing; vice chairmen of  the municipal committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference; vice mayors and advisers to the  municipal government; secretary and deputy secretaries of the  municipal discipline inspection commission; deputy secretary  general of the municipal party committee; major responsible  persons of the various departments, committees, and offices of  the municipal party committee; and secretaries of district and  county party committees.    Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party committee,  presided over the session.    That morning, Comrade Li Qiyan gave a report to give  opinions  on implementation of the guidelines of the national economic  work conference and on initial arrangements for Beijing's 1994  reform and development.    The report said: Since the beginning of this year, the  people throughout the municipality have conscientiously studied  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, adhered to the party's basic line, and,  proceeding from Beijing's reality, have further emancipated the  mind, adopted new ideas and large-scale measures to accelerate  reform and opening up in all sectors, and developed the economy  in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner. Comprehensive  fulfillment of the target of "making this year's work surpass  last year's" as defined by the municipal party committee and  people's congress early this year has become a certainty, and a  good foundation has been laid for next year's reform and  development. Some major manifestations follow:    1) The economy has developed in a rapid, healthy, and  orderly  manner in the process of accelerating the transition to the  market economy. 2) Urban construction has been expedited, and  eye-catching changes have taken place in urban and rural areas.  3) Science and technology, education, and other social  undertakings have developed comprehensively. 4) Urban and rural  people's living standards have been promoted to new heights. 5)  New breakthroughs have been achieved in the reform focusing on  establishing the socialist market economy system and  transforming enterprises' operating mechanism. 6) The endeavor  of opening to the outside world has been promoted to an  unprecedented range and quality. In addition to the new  achievements in economic development, reform, and opening up,  notable results have also been won in building the socialist  spiritual civilization, improving the legal system, and building  a clean government. In general, down-to-earth and effective  work of this year has laid a good foundation and created a new  opportunity for Beijing's economy to develop rapidly based on a  new starting point next year.    Speaking on the initial arrangements for next year's  economic  work, Li Qiyan pointed out in his report: Next year will be an  extremely important year for comprehensively implementing the  decision of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central  Committee and accelerating the establishment of the socialist  market economy system. It will also be a crucial year to  accelerating Beijing's socialist modernization and achieving the  fairly comfortable standard of living three years ahead of  schedule. The basic idea for Beijing's economic work is to  emancipate the mind, seize the opportunity to accelerate reform  and opening up, expedite economic development, and strive to  achieve a fairly comfortable standard of living three years  ahead of schedule. We should emphasize the following work:    A. We should speed up the establishment of the socialist  market economy system, with the focus on establishing the modern  enterprise system and the system for macroeconomic regulation  and control. Next year's reform should focus on transforming  enterprises' operating mechanism and establishing a modern  enterprise system, and efforts should be made to achieve  substantial progress. Meanwhile, focusing on the reform of the  financial and tax, monetary, investment, and foreign trade  systems, we should establish more rapidly the systems for  macroeconomic regulation and control and change the government  function of economic administration.    B. We should open wider to the outside world and make a new  breakthrough in using foreign capital. We should continue to  regard use of foreign capital as the most important part of the  endeavor of opening to the outside world, expand the scope of  the endeavor, open more fields to the outside world, and improve  the level. While adhering to the principle of "developing  large, medium-sized, and small projects simultaneously," we  should particularly draw in funds from international  multi-national companies and consortia to build large key  projects when bringing in funds from abroad.    C. We should optimize the industrial composition, improve  economic efficiency, and maintain the good trend of rapid  development in urban and rural economies.    D. We must have the greatest determination and make the  greatest efforts in accelerating the construction of urban  infrastructure facilities and raise the level of modernization  in urban and rural areas. We should mobilize the efforts of all  sectors and comprehensively advance the "well-off housing  project" because this is one of the important links for  realizing the goal of having the whole municipality become  well-off ahead of schedule.    E. We should give play to the advantages of the capital and  accelerate scientific and technological progress and the  training of personnel.    The report points out: In order to smoothly fulfill all  fields of work during next year, leading cadres at all levels  should first solve the following major issues of understanding.  First, we should further emancipate the mind. The priority is  to further emancipate the mind in four aspects, including how to  cope with the economic development rate, what standards to use  to judge the realization of the goal of becoming well-off, how  to recognize macroeconomic regulation and control under the  socialist market economic conditions and how to expand the  spheres of using foreign capital. Second, we should firmly seize  the current opportunity and have a high sense of historical  responsibility and urgency towards this. Third, we should  correctly handle the relations of reform, opening up, economic  development and social stability. We should pay particular  attention to maintaining stability and never slacken our guard  in this issue. Fourth, we should realistically improve work  style and strengthen the building of honest and diligent  administration. Fifth, we must pay high attention to and  realistically strengthen study. It is necessary to use Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics to arm the the minds of cadres at all levels.  We should soberly recognize that we are still not familiar with  the socialist market economy. We must study honestly and  sincerely and thoroughly understand the guidelines of the  central authorities and the content of a series of reform plans.    In the afternoon, Chen Guangwen, deputy secretary of the  municipal party committee, gave a report to the plenary session  on the situation of anticorruption work since the past four  months.    Since the issuance of the anticorruption work plans  formulated by the municipal party committee and the municipal  government in line with the guidelines of the second plenary  session of the central Discipline Inspection Commission and  Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech in September, the municipality has  achieved initial results in its anticorruption struggle and  implemented the three tasks on anticorruption struggle raised by  the State Council. 1) In line with the demand of the municipal  party committee and the municipal government, leading bodies at  and above the section level across the municipality have held  democratic life meetings on schedule, conducted self-insepction  and correction in line with the "11 prohibitions" stipulated in  the five central principles and briefed the situation to the  masses. 2) We have concentrated efforts on the investigation  and handling of a batch of major and appalling cases. In the  past four months, the procuratorial organs across the  municipality filed 263 economic cases on corruption and bribery  for investigation; the courts sentenced 35 criminals involving  in four groups and appalling cases, of whom, 25 criminals were  sentenced to more than 10-years of imprisonment and 22 were  sentenced to death and made their cases known to the public. 3)  We have achieved great results in clearing up the work of  arbitrarily collecting service charges. As of 10 December, the  whole municipality had cleared up a total of 586 cases of this  category. 4) We have comprehensively conducted the work of  relentlessly checking several unhealthy trends which the masses  have strong complaints. The unhealthy trend of using public  funds to travel outside the country (territory) has been  basically checked; business and enterprises involving party and  government organs and the establishment of organs that need  payment for providing consulting services have been initially  banned; and new progress has been made in the work of rectifying  work style of telecommunications departments and railway system.  5) We have closely combined anticorruption with clean and  diligent administration and made honest administration to  promote diligent administration.    In referring to the next step of anticorruption struggle,  Chen Guangwen proposed: It is necessary to continuously uphold  the principles of persisting in "taking a two-handed approach  and be tough with both," "first be resolute, second, be  persistent, and third, achieving expected results," and exert  great efforts to grasp them well. We must not overestimate the  achivements we have made or neglect the existing problems or  lower our guard on this. In the morning, the committee members  also held group discussions on Comrade Li Qiyan's report. At  the end of the session, Chen Guangwen gave a summing-up speech.</p>

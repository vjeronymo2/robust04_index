			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Swiss to vote on EEA in December SWITZERLAND'S referendum on the European Economic Area (EEA) treaty will take place on December 6, thus avoiding a possible crisis over implementation next January 1 of the free trade pact between the European Community and the European Free Trade Association countries. Leaders of Switzerland's ruling political parties two weeks ago urged the government to delay the vote, fearing that the Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty and a possible similar outcome in the French referendum next month would make Swiss citizens even more wary about moving closer to the EC than they already are.</p>

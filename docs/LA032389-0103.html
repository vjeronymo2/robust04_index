			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROUP PROPOSES NO-FRILLS AUTO POLICY FOR $160  </P> <P> A proposal by a coalition of minority groups for making available to all  Californians a no-frills, no-fault auto insurance policy that would satisfy the  state's mandatory insurance law and cost only about $160 per automobile won  backing Wednesday from state Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie.  </P> <P> The proposal probably faces an uphill fight because it would require assent by  the Legislature to changes in the legal system that have been resisted by the  California Trial Lawyers Assn. and its powerful friends in the state Senate and  Assembly.  </P> <P> In exchange for getting insurance at such a low rate, buyers would have to  agree to give up all pain and suffering damages except for the most serious and  permanent injuries, and they would voluntarily agree to severely restrict  lawsuits against others.  </P> <P> But Gillespie said Wednesday that actuaries in the state Insurance Department  have told her that the $160 price would allow insurance companies to break even  without a state subsidy. She said she has agreed to convene a high-level  meeting, including Deukmejian Administration officials and representatives of  the insurance industry, the trial lawyers and consumer groups, to settle on the  details.  </P> <P> "We reviewed the work that had been done, and there is definitely a lot of  logic in what they have put forth, and we feel very strongly it's a point of  departure to obtain the input of the interested parties and go forth with such  a basic plan," Gillespie said.  </P> <P> In a letter to John Gamboa, executive director of the Latino Issues Forum,  Gillespie said, "I would like to wholeheartedly congratulate your group for the  approach that you have taken."  </P> <P> The proposal, for which a legislative sponsor has yet to be named, is being  made by the Latino Issues Forum; the California Council of Urban Leagues; the  Oakland Citizens Committee for Urban Renewal; Mario Obledo, the national chair  of Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition; the Interdenominational Ministerial  Alliance, and the League of United Latin American Citizens.  </P> <P> The no-frills, no-fault policy being proposed by these groups would cost  drivers the same amount no matter where they live. Under the so-called  territorial rating system now used by insurance companies, policyholders who  live in certain areas -- heavily congested cities, for instance -- pay much  more for insurance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Keep People Out of Jail  </P> <P> Under a no-fault system, people who have accidents collect for their injuries  from their own insurance companies, regardless of who is at fault in the  accident. Gillespie said that her actuaries have told her that "if you have a  first party system for that portion, you do not need territorial-based  pricing."  </P> <P> Gamboa declared: "The $160 no-frills policy will keep 500,000 Californians out  of jail and provide affordable insurance to 6 million low- and moderate-income  Californians. It could also lower auto insurance rates for all Californians."  </P> <P> He noted that those wanting additional coverage, beyond the equivalent of the  $15,000 individual/$30,000 group liability limits required now by the state,  would be free to buy excess insurance.  </P> <P> George Dean, president of the California Council of Urban Leagues, said, "We  hope that everyone involved in the insurance crisis will work toward a  compromise that ensures that the working poor do not have to make the choice  between jail and high-cost insurance that exceeds all their discretionary  income."  </P> <P> In fact, very few Californians have gone to jail for not carrying the required  liability insurance, but the state Department of Motor Vehicles recently  revealed that during 1988, the first full year of toughened mandatory insurance  enforcement, more than 550,000 drivers had had their licenses suspended.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Equal Treatment'  </P> <P> Obledo, meanwhile, said that the proposed no-frills policy would "eliminate the  gap in Proposition 103" as far as assuring an affordable policy for everyone,  and thereby "ensure equal treatment for all."  </P> <P> First reaction from the legal community, however, was very cool. Some attorneys  at a meeting of defense counsel for the insurance companies in Los Angeles on  Wednesday questioned whether the suggested price was too low. They said a major  state subsidy might have to be provided to make such a plan financially viable.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the Trial Lawyers Assn., Patti Levine, said the trial lawyers  would "probably" oppose a plan that allowed accident victims even voluntarily  to give up their rights to sue, although she said the association had formed a  committee to examine such proposals for "mini-policies."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Stingy' Benefit Package  </P> <P> "Our understanding is that this proposal has a very stingy no-fault benefit  package and as any mini-policy they tend to discriminate against the poor by  saying poor people should not be compensated as well as others," Levine said.  </P> <P> Insurance industry officials who have been involved in discussions with the  minority coalition have said they believe that if a no-frills, no-fault policy  were offered, a large majority of Californians, interested in low prices and  not really expecting to have accidents, would select it. But some have also  expressed concern that once people had accidents, they might be dissatisfied  with the level of benefits they received.  </P></p>

"Moscow's rather rigid stand in the reassessment of events  in  Tajikistan by the leader of the regional superpower, Islam  Karimov, make it possible to hope that at the forthcoming talks  the conflicting sides will reach some kind of compromise: If  moscow succeeds in achieving success, that will be a major  triumph of Russian diplomacy".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an article by Umerserik Kasenov,  director of the Institute of Strategic Studies to the President  of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Kosenov points out: "The process  of the formation and development of newly-independent states is  now under way in Central Asia in difficult conditions. Much in  this process undoubtedly depends on Russia which keeps hold of  powerful economic, political and military levers for influencing  the situation in the Central Asian region...    "Unfortunately, Russia's foreign-policy course with regard  to  the ex-Soviet republics, including Central Asian ones,  increasingly indicates that it pursues a divide-and-rule policy".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict:    "Vladislav Ardzinba availed himself of the ground provided  by  the Georgian parliament to announce the termination of political  talks between Georgia and Abkhazia until the decision to  dissolve the Abkhazian parliament and to institute judicial  proceedings against its members is cancelled.    "Despite the fact that the dispute, it would seem, is a  formal legal one and concerns the situation which preceded the  start of the armed conflict, the Georgian parliament's  resolution really interrupted the contradictory as it was  dialogue which has been conducted until now between  representatives of the two conflicting sides".    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries an interview with Ramiz Razayev,  plenipotentiary representative of the Republic of Azerbaijan to  Russia, who points out:    "As far as Russia's role in a peaceful settlement of the  Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict is concerned, one should proceed  from the assumption that Russia's geopolitical and economic  interests are in need of stability on its southern borders...  Therefore, we regard Russia's active participation in  settlement efforts and the country's unprejudiced stand as major  factors leading to a resolution of this complex problem".    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI runs an interview with Mikhail Mironov,  chief of the mail department of the presidential staff. He said  that up to 1,500 letters addressed to the country's president  come in every day and deal with a broad spectrum of problems  while the department has 100 staff members.    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA referring to an informed staff member  of  the central office of the Russian Federal Counter-Intelligence  Service (FCS) asserts that "the presidential administration is  studying as one of reorganisation options the possibility of  dividing the FCS with a transfer of its functions to other  bodies.    "The FCS counter-intelligence operations directorate is  expected, in particular, to be turned over to the Ministry of  Justice and to be transformed into a federal investigation  directorate.    "The economic counter-intelligence directorate and  directorate for the security of strategically important  industrial facilities is suggested to be subordinated to the  Ministry of Economics while the military counterintelligence  will be brought under the authority of the General Staff as an  independent directorate.    "The anti-terrorism directorate is expected to be brought  within the competence of the Interior Ministry. The idea of  dividing the FCS is authored by one of the members of the  Russian Security Council...    "FCS Chief Sergey Stepashin said he will have a meeting with  the Russian president soon. He did not refute the information  that proposals to reorganise the FCS and transfer its powers to  other agencies come in to Boris Yeltsin.    "If the proposals are implemented, a serious blow will be  dealt to security agencies. I categorically object to it and I  oppose those who make such proposals. One should ponder what  for they do that. I am deeply convinced that Russia and the  president need strong secret services. I will uphold this  thesis during a meeting with Yeltsin," Stepashin said.    NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA (NEW DAILY NEWSPAPER) Carries  an interview with Major-General Yuriy Drozdov, former chief of  illegals' counterintelligence. He expressed regret that the  Vympel special-purpose unit has broken up. He regarded with  understanding the Vympel officers who did not opt to serve on  the payroll of the Interior Ministry.    "I do not censure them. They were prepared to uphold the  interests of the native land and their people from an outside  foe and outside their country. The sense of devotion to their  people, the duty and honour of the intelligence officer did not  allow them to act otherwise".    The general referred to the break-up of the unit as "the  worst thing that could happen". He is convinced that such a  unit is necessary for the country now as well, emphasising that  a special- purpose unit, whose officers did not know what the  word 'impossible' meant, has ceased to exist.    In PRAVDA, prominent film director Stanislav Govorukhin said  on the same subject:    "the October events showed: the Ministry of Security will  not  carry out criminal orders and will not act against their people.  To my mind, it has already become a commonly known fact how  worthily the ministry's units Alpha and Vympel behaved in those  days.    "I want to draw the readers' particular attention to the  following circumstance: the Security Ministry was disbanded at a  time when it almost entirely switched over to action against  economic crime which inflicts the greatest damage on the state".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) runs an interview with  Colonel-General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian Armed  Forces' General Staff, who said that the operational structure  of troops has been basically broken up following the  disintegration of the Soviet Union.    "We have lost territory and, accordingly, the strategic  echelon, while the reserve forces constitute the core of the  first operational echelon. It was needed to create groups of  troops throughout the western and southwestern sectors  practically anew".    Kolesnikov said the complexity was in the fact that units  subject to withdrawal had to settle in places which lacked the  necessary infrastructure. "This was taking place during the  period of the development and reforming of the Armed Forces with  an acute shortage of material resources and funds", Kolesnikov  said.    ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Mikhail  Poltoranin, chairman of the State Duma committee on information  policy and communications, who suggests that the powers of the  president and parliament be extended until 1998.    Poltoranin touched upon the problem of drawing up a  memorandum of civil accord. His opinion is that such a document  should be backed up by deeds without fail. "Let it be a small  memorandum with clear-cut declarations but it should be  supplemented without fail with a treaty on coordinated actions  of the authorities, specific actions with a specific time-frame."    ST. PETERSBURG GAZETTE reports that the Ivangorod mayor's  office has reinstated a voluntary public order maintenance  squad. The newspaper points out that every member of the public  order squad will be paid for every hour on duty from the funds  of the city department of internal affairs while the maintenance  of the chief of staff of the squad has been assumed by the  mayor's office.</p>

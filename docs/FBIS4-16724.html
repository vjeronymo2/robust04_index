			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 19 TASS -- "It is already clear that  the Council of the Federation cannot work on a non-permanent  basis," Vladimir Shumeyko, speaker of the upper chamber of the  Russian parliament, told a journalistic roundtable here today.  "It will probably be necessary to amend the Constitution of the  Russian Federation," he said, replying to an ITAR-TASS question  on the organisation of the work of the parliament's upper  chamber. In Shumeyko's opinion, members of the council should  be elected and not delegated from each subject of the  Federation. "It is impossible to combine the duties of a  governor and senator," he noted.    Summing up the results of the first 100 days of the  chamber's  work, its speaker said that they were "spent on thinking over  the functions of the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly".  There are three points of view on this score among the MPs and  in the society as a whole. The first view is that the council  should work in strict accordance with the constitutional norms.  The second view is that the chamber, being as it is the supreme  legislative body, should tackle all the most important questions  of social life, just as it was done by the old Supreme Soviet.  This point of view is shared, in particular, by the heads of  the subjects of the Federation, who account for the majority of  the council members. And, finally, there is a view that the  upper chamber should be "a buffer between the lower chamber and  the president". This view is shared by the presidential  administration.    Referring to the view of the heads of council committees,  whom the speaker met on Monday, Shumeyko said that "the  procedural rules of the Council of the Federation should be  amended". The council must discuss all the vitally important  problems, but at parliamentary hearings, not at sessions. Such  hearings must be "an effective mechanism of its work". In some  countries, the speaker recalled, they last for 1.5 years,  discussing the most important problems and tabling proposals.  Sessions of the chamber could be called whenever they are  necessary, in particular, to endorse laws, presidential decrees,  and other documents that are within the constitutional  competence of the upper chamber.</p>

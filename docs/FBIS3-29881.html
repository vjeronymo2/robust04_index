Korea's exports to China grew by a whopping  165 percent in 1992 and again by 90 percent in 1993. Bilateral  trade between the two countries is expected to grow by an annual  average rate of 33.2 percent between 1993 and 1997 and by 18.9  percent for the 1998- 2001 period. China has also become the  most preferred country for direct investments among Korean  firms. Last year, the government authorized 616 applications  for investment in China, the largest number for a single target  country.    The aggregate amount of Korean investments in China,  however,  is still small because direct investment by Korean firms began  to surge only from 1992. As of the end of 1993, the aggregate  amount of investment authorized by the government is still less  than $1 billion. Of this, $465 million had actually been  invested by the end of last year. China, however, is considered  to be more than a simple trading partner; it is regarded as a  crucial partner for industrial cooperation as well. During  President Kim's visit, the foundation will be laid for strategic  industrial alliance between the two countries.    The government will seek, among other things, an industrial  cooperation agreement with China. Based on the framework to be  provided by the agreement, the soon-to-be-formed Korea-China  Joint Committee for Industrial Cooperation will systematically  promote the industrial alliance. To finance the committee's  activities, the Seoul government will soon inaugurate a fund,  hopefully together with China, of some $6 million.    In the inaugural meeting in Beijing, the committee will  hammer out the principles and types of cooperation, select the  primary areas of cooperation and discuss other avenues of  cooperation.    For Korea, the main fields of cooperation include aircraft,  autos, digital telephone exchanges and nuclear power plants,  while China is interested in cooperation in high-definition TV  (HDTV), facsimile and large-screen color TVs.    In case of aircraft, Korea wants to jointly develop, produce  and sell a commuter aircraft of up to 100 seats. Korea has  already announced an aircraft development plan and China is  expected to be invited to participate in this plan.    In the automobile sector, Korea has been asking China to  allow imports of finished Korean autos and will encourage Korean  parts producers to invest in China.    The Seoul government has also been eager to participate in  China's telephone network modernization programs with Korean-  developed digital telephone exchanges. Cooperation in  developing a next-generation telephone exchanges is also on the  agenda.    The nuclear power sector is another promising avenue of  cooperation as China will construct new nuclear power plants.  The Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO) has signed an agreement  to provide operational and management service to the nuclear  power plant in Guangdong Province. Korea may be able to supply  power generation equipment and participate in plant construction.    Korea also plans to help China accumulate technology in such  fields of interest as HDTV [high definition television],  facsimile and large-size color TVs.    Industrial cooperation also involves joint sponsorship of  the  so- called technology mart and exchange of engineers to  facilitate technological exchange in specific sectors and to  help individual firms to address firm-specific needs.    To expand trade further and stimulate direct investment, the  Seoul government will also implement a set of new measures.  First, it intends to increase the provision of loans by the  Export-Import Bank of Korea for deferred payment exports of  Korean industrial facilities to be used for economic development  in China.    According to an official of the Ministry of Trade, Industry  and Energy (MOTIE), the bank is currently evaluating nine  applications for loans amounting to $1.2 billion. Among them is  an application for loans to finance $250 million exports of  rolling stocks to the Guangdong Province of China. The Ex-Im  Bank's loans carry 7-8 percent annual interest rates, not so low  compared with ordinary bank interest rates of around 12 percent.  To alleviate the burden of interest rates on Korean exporters  to China, the government plans to provide them with the Economic  Development Cooperation Funds (EDCF) whose interest rates are  2-2.5 percent a year. The government will expand the coverage of  export insurance for plant exports to China, while at the same  time holding exhibitions of Korean goods in major cities in  China every year.    Within first half of this year, the MOTIE will also come up  with a plan to encourage Korean distributors to advance into  China and build up their own distribution networks. Up till now,  according to a MOTIE official, Korean exports to China have  largely been materials for reexports; Korean goods have not yet  penetrated into the domestic consumption market of China.    Partly, this was the result of the discriminatory tariff  rates against Korean goods which were abolished only in 1992.  Now that Korean goods can compete with foreign products on an  equal footing, Korean exporters are in need of well-functioning  distribution networks just as their Japanese and Hong Kong  rivals do.    This year, the Seoul government will be more prudent in  invoking antidumping and adjustment tariffs against imports from  China to head off unnecessary trade disputes. To stimulate  direct investment in China, MOTIE will select industrial sectors  suitable for production plant transfer to China and will provide  administrative and financial assistance to those who actually  relocate plants. Candidate sectors for this encouragement  measure include footwear and textiles.    Korean investments in China tend to cluster in such  northeastern parts as Shantung and Liaoning Provinces and  Tianjin City near Beijing. According to MOTIE officials,  investments need to be more diversified geographically as each  of the 10 major regions of China has its own development plan.  MOTIE has requested the Korea Institute for Industrial  Economics and Technology to draw up a detailed investment plan  tailored to the development programs of the 10 regions. The  ministry has also told the Korea Trade Promotion Corp. (KOTRA)  to set up trade centers in Dalian and Chonqing this year.  Currently, KOTRA operates trade centers in Beijing and Shanghai.    Korean banks will be encouraged to expand their branch  networks in China and a Korea-China joint venture lease firm  will be promoted to provide Korean firms in China with an easier  access to capital. According to a MOTIE official, the Daewoo and  Halla Business Groups have expressed interest in setting up the  envisioned lease firm.    All these measures are expected to help economic ties  between  Seoul and Beijing evolve into a new dimension. The two  economies are, according to experts, basically complementary in  nature, although in some sectors, they do compete. In  approaching each other, the two countries may as well try to  expand and capitalize on complementarity.</p>

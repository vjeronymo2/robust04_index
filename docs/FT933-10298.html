			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / S Korea's chaebol get protection against state: John Burton looks at a court ruling on a conglomerate's fate A COURT ruling last week overturning the forced dissolution of a South Korean conglomerate could mark a turning point by easing the government's centralised control over industry and the financial system. The decision, overruling a 1985 government order disbanding the Kukje group, is seen as improving the legal protection of the country's industrial groups, or chaebol, against state interference. Although the government of President Kim Young-sam welcomed the ruling as promoting its policy of economic deregulation, it could hamper the administration's efforts to streamline the chaebol and reduce their dominance in the Korean economy. The Kukje case is a textbook example of how the government used the financial system to control the chaebol in the past three decades. Kukje and other chaebol grew on soft government loans in the 1960s and 1970s as they led the country's rapid industrialisation. But the extensive borrowings made the chaebol dependent on the state for their survival since they were highly leveraged. Kukje, for example, had an astronomical debt-to-equity ratio of 964 per cent when it was dissolved. When Kukje encountered financial problems, the government of President Chun Doo-hwan, the former military dictator, refused to let the banks, which operate under close state guidance, provide new loans to save the group. Instead, Kukje was broken up under government direction and its 20 subsidiaries were sold to companies considered to have close ties to the Chun administration. The South Korean constitutional court, in declaring the Kukje dissolution illegal, explained that the action was an infringement of private property rights. 'The ruling meant that the legal system, not arbitrary government decisions, should determine the fate of companies, such as whether they can be liquidated,' explained Mr John Wadle, an analyst with BZW in Seoul. Kukje was not alone. Almost 80 ailing private companies were forcibly merged, liquidated or sold by the Chun administration during the mid-1980s as part of an industrial rationalisation programme, following similar restructuring efforts ordered by earlier governments. The new owners of these companies were provided with extensive financial and tax benefits by the government to support their takeovers. Banks were ordered by the state to suspend collecting interest on loans that had previously been made to the troubled companies in order to ease financial pressure on their new owners. This has been blamed for substantially contributing to the banks' current heavy burden of non-performing loans. Independent analysts estimate the amount of non-performing loans has reached Won11,000bn (Pounds 9.2bn), although the official figure is Won2,300bn. The Chun government justified its action by arguing that confiscated companies were poorly managed and could survive only under more efficiently run business groups. But critics allege Kukje and some other companies were taken from owners who did not support the Chun government. Whatever the cause, the break-up of Kukje underscored the vulnerability of the other chaebol to the government's control of the financial system. Kukje's demise was interpreted as a warning that any chaebol that fell out of favour with the government could be subject to credit restrictions and possible bankruptcy. These fears were revived last year when Hyundai, the country's largest conglomerate, suddenly had problems getting loans after its founder, Mr Chung Ju-yung, declared a presidential bid against the ruling party candidate, Mr Kim. Although President Kim has promised to reduce state intervention in the banking sector, the family owners of the biggest conglomerates remain concerned that he may resort to using credit controls and tax laws to force them to dispose of companies as part of the chaebol reform policy. The ruling could provide the chaebol with a constitutional argument against such moves since the court based its Kukje decision on a constitutional article stating that the economy is governed by the 'principle of individual freedom'. Although the ruling has improved the general position of business in relation to government, it could adversely affect some companies. Companies that took over businesses confiscated by the Chun government could face court battles as their former owners try to regain control. The ruling may discourage the government from intervening to save companies in financial trouble. The state until now has virtually guaranteed that important companies would never go bust. This would also mean reduced government interference in determining bank loan policy. The state traditionally has directed banks to provide low-interest loans to strategic industries or financially weak companies whose collapse could cause significant unemployment.</p>

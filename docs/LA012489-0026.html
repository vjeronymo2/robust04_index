			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: NORTH COUNTY  </P> <P> A nephew of Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) has agreed to replant 12 acres of  vegetation along the San Luis Rey River in exchange for the district attorney's  office dropping a misdemeanor charge that he cleared the farmland, which was a  habitat for the least Bell's vireo, an endangered bird.  </P> <P> The agreement, announced Friday, calls for H. Von Packard Jr. to plant 1,000  trees, including black willows, cottonwoods, wild roses and live oaks on the  property, at a cost of up to $30,000.  </P> <P> Packard's attorney, Charles Goldberg, said the land was cleared by a farmer who  was leasing the land from Packard and planned to plant tomatoes on it. In the  agreement with prosecutors, Packard said he did not intend to cause any harm to  the river bank, but nonetheless accepted responsibility for the farmer's  action.  </P> <P> The land clearing was in violation of a state Department of Fish and Game law  that prohibits the changing of a river bank without first notifying wildlife  officials. The misdemeanor carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail and  a $500 fine.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office charged Packard with the crime in November, but  Goldberg said he and prosecutors were already in settlement negotiations, which  included Packard hiring an environmental consultant to determine how to repair  the damage.  </P></p>

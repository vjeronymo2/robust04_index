			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE SEARCH AREA OF STABBINGS  </P> <P> San Diego Police conducted an extensive air and ground search Sunday in the  area where two University City women were slain late last week.  </P> <P> From 6 a.m. until almost 3 p.m., homicide units, in addition to canine, horse,  helicopter and foot patrols -- a total of 35 officers -- searched canyon areas  near the murder scene in the 5800 block of Honors Drive.  </P> <P> Thursday, Pamela Gail Glark, 42, and Amber Michelle Clark, her 18-year-old  daughter, were found stabbed to death inside the family's residence. The elder  Clark worked as an assistant to her husband, Joseph Lazzaro, a Mission Hills  acupuncturist.  </P> <P> The younger Clark was a student at Mesa College and a recent graduate of  University City High School, where police set up a command post Sunday  afternoon.  </P> <P> Investigators believe the latest slayings may be related to three previous  stabbing deaths in Clairemont, all involving young women.  </P> <P> In the stabbing death of Holly Suzanne Tarr on April 3, a suspect was seen  running from the scene.  </P></p>

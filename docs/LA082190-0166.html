			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NELSON TO FACE LAPORTE IN TITLE DEFENSE  </P> <P> Azumah Nelson will defend his World Boxing Council super featherweight title  against Juan LaPorte of Puerto Rico at the Sydney Entertainment Center on Oct.  13, promoter Bill Mordey announced today.  </P> <P> Mordey said the winner of the fight, which has been switched from Sept. 7 at  Nelson's request, will fight Australian three-time world champion Jeff Fenech  in Sydney in February.  </P> <P> Mordey said he has signed a two-fight deal with American promoter Don King  worth $1.6 million and said he will co-promote both bouts with King.  </P> <P> Nelson relinquished the title earlier this year to challenge Pernell Whitaker  of the United States for the WBC lightweight crown. He lost a decision to  Whitaker.  </P> <P> LaPorte and Fenech were slated to meet for the vacant title, but the unbeaten  Australian has twice withdrawn with a viral infection.  </P> <P> "The WBC has said it still recognizes Nelson as champion, so he will defend  against LaPorte with the winner to face Fenech," Mordey said.  </P></p>

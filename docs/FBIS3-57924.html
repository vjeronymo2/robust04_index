			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Colette Braeckman: "The Honor of the Men on </F> the Ground"]    [Text] A hot-tempered General Briquemont assures us that he  no longer even reads the UN resolutions concerning the former  Yugoslavia. Meanwhile, Gen. Cot says that if his pride can be  set aside, then there will come a time when it is a matter of  honor. Indeed, there is a feeling of lost honor among the men  who, on the ground, are finding that they are impotent to  correctly fulfil the mandate entrusted to them by the United  Nations.    And yet, what mandate are we concerned with precisely?  Creating safe areas? They are violated every day. Ensuring  that the embargo imposed on Serbia is respected? European  countries, and major ones at that, are suspected of bypassing it  regularly. Protecting a Bosnian population under fire from  snipers, or ensuring the provision of humanitarian aid? Every  day, drivers of UN trucks -- some of them Belgians -- are  confronted with fresh pitfalls and new obstacles which force  them to negotiate and parley with people whom they would rather  have wanted to prevent from causing harm.    The military assure us that they lack the means to carry out  their mission. There is a shortage of personnel: At least  50,000 men would be needed to guarantee the safe areas. There  is a lack of training: How to handle endless arguments with  village chiefs, whether in Bosnia or Somalia, is not yet taught  at military academies. UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali  had an easy time replying to his critics back in 1992 when, in  his "Agenda for Peace," he advocated creation of "peace  enforcement units" which would be made available by relevant  governments. Alas! Ever since he has had to make do with an  administrative staff which only has an entirely relative  authority over the contingents "loaned" to the United Nations.    In Somalia, it is from Rome -- not New York -- that the  Italian soldiers take their orders; the Swedish troops in  Yugoslavia follow the directives issued by Stockholm, while U.S.  troops refuse to obey officers of other nationalities.  Furthermore, the United Nations is faced with rising costs of  peace missions: In Somalia, UNOSOM [UN Operation in Somalia] is  reproached for having cost $1.5 billion. In Angola, on the other  hand, where the UN commitment during the elections was  inadequate, an interventionary force is now required: Upon his  return from Luanda, [former Belgian Prime Minister] Martens  estimated that 10,000 men would be needed -- but who should be  sent? Who will pay the bill? If the United Nations, or more  specifically the five permanent members of the Security Council,  grumble about supporting a new intervention in Angola, Burundi,  or even Zaire, then it will be precisely because Bosnia and  Somalia have poured boiling water over any goodwill that there  might have been.    The United Nations, which is expected to do great things but  is often accused of performing very badly, is only an instrument  of the policy -- or lack of policy -- of the international  community. The real mandate of intervention -- imposing or  maintaining peace, transporting humanitarian aid, disarming  warring factions, protecting civil populations -- whether in  Somalia or Bosnia -- is as blurred as the political will of the  member states. Moreover, at the end of the day, the armed  forces who are taking the risks and the humanitarian personnel  who are making sacrifices have the uncomfortable feeling of  being the screen destined to mask the incapability of leading  politicians to zero in on the real problems and decide on  genuine solutions.</p>

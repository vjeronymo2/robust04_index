			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Martin Winter: "Rudolf Scharping Builds Bridges </F> Across the Atlantic"]    [Text] Washington -- Rudolf Scharping, who wants to beat  Helmut Kohl with domestic issues -- including jobs, economic  upswing, and social justice -- travels a great deal in the  world. For good reason. When drafting strategies for the  election campaign, the candidate for chancellor arrived at the  conclusion months ago that he must "deprive the Christian  Democratic Union [CDU] of the illusion" that it can brand him as  a foreign-policy amateur and thus as a risk for German security.  In fact, foreign policy will not play a major role in the  election campaign, but Scharping knows that in a neck-and-neck  race foreign skepticism concerning his policies might supply the  CDU with ammunition.    Trying to prevent this on the basis of the slogan that good  and well-informed friends do not say bad things about oneself,  Scharping decided to visit the Commission of the European Union  in Brussels, Paris, Prague, Washington, New York, Warsaw, and  the NATO headquarters. He introduces himself and promises  continuity in German foreign policy. He spent five full days in  the United States to convince political and economic figures  there. He did not go there without any fears. A cool reception  and a critical press would have been a pleasure for his rival  Helmut Kohl. Anticipating such a turn of events, Juergen  Ruettgers, the parliamentary manager of the CDU/Christian Social  Union [CSU] Bundestag group, maliciously predicted a great  humiliation for Scharping because the Social Democratic Party  [SPD] is "unable to pursue a responsible policy within the  alliance," and because it would "completely abandon the Western  community" together with the Greens. This only makes the  Atlantic-minded Scharping laugh.    Yet he was nervous about how things would go. Only when he  had returned from his meeting with President Bill Clinton, did  he look relaxed. "All went off really well," he stated  repeatedly and ordered a cold beer in the press room of the  Watergate Hotel. "This will support the current strong process  of relaxation," he stated. Contented, he stretched on a sofa and  admitted: "I feel much better now than on Sunday evening."    However, it became clear after his arrival on Sunday [10  April] that both Social Democratic fears and Christian Democrat  hopes were unjustified. Scharping's reception was open and  friendly -- the American way. Yet there was a little more to  it that was not noticeable when former SPD chancellor candidates  like Johannes Rau, Hans Jochen Vogel, and Oskar Lafontaine  visited the United States: Curiosity combined with attention  that, between the White House and Capitol, is only devoted to  those who have political weight or who are expected to assume a  high office soon.    The candidate found open doors everywhere. With Clinton, he  had a "surprisingly friendly and informal conversation,"  Scharping stated. The same is true of the meeting with  Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Treasury Secretary Lloyd  Bentsen, and Defense Secretary William Perry. Senior Senate  officials and congressmen took their time, and when Scharping  gave a speech at an event jointly organized by the  Friedrich-Ebert Foundation and the U.S. Institute for  Contemporary German Studies, the room was packed. In New York,  the Social Democrats met with important bankers, industrialists,  and top journalists. As a senior official put it, they all  wanted to "get to know the man who leads Kohl in the polls," and  whom prior to his visit the major papers NEW YORK TIMES and  WASHINGTON POST had benevolently described as Kohl's possible  successor and the German Clinton. That certainly impressed the  White House.    Scharping is pleased about the comparison with Clinton. "In  fact, we are examining what Clinton has initiated in the United  States." He sees common interests, a common "way of thinking"  in environmental and tax policies, and, above all, there is the  joint conviction that a country can only be stable and act in a  responsible way in foreign policy if it is internally stable --  which is not possible if unemployment is high.    This is a language that builds bridges and is understood by  the Americans. It has become known as "new thinking," and a  new generation of politicians is emerging. Scharping and  Clinton are about the same age, both protested against the war  in Vietnam -- the SPD chairman was even temporarily excluded  from his party because of that in 1968 -- and both were  influenced by the policies of the 1960's and 1970's. Bob  Bradley, a Democratic Senator from New Jersey, has described his  friend Scharping as the "most prominent politician of the German  postwar generation." Yet, despite the things that Clinton and  Scharping have in common, Washington does not hide the fact that  it is interested in a stable and predictable German Government  -- no matter who leads it. Kohl's advantage over Scharping is  that he is well-known at the White House, and that the U.S.  Administration believes that it is able to judge him correctly.    During a dinner hosted in honor of the candidate,  appreciation was expressed, but also fears concerning Germany's  future: It might not master unification, it might try to pursue  its own paths, and it might lose its stability. Moreover, a  Chancellor Scharping might be forced by his party to adopt a  foreign-policy course that he does not like. There are people  like Lafontaine and some others who are not so dedicated to the  West and NATO, it was pointed out.    It is these fears, which were only voiced very cautiously  and  in a friendly way in the United Sates, but which the CDU might  turn into heavy weapons in the election campaign, that prompt  Scharping to tour the world. He is hammering his foreign policy  credo into the heads of politicians and journalists as though he  wanted to cut it into granite: Friendship with the United  States, Germany's integration in the European Union, NATO's  continued and "indispensable" existence, and aid for the  development of stable democracies in Russia and the Central and  East European countries.    To convince even the last doubters, Scharping simply  invented  a new law -- that of the continuity of German foreign policy.  Thus, Social Democratic Chancellors Brandt and Schmidt  continued Adenauer's world policy and developed their ostpolitik  on this basis. The current chancellor then continued the  ostpolitik "in a completely correct manner." The next  chancellor will keep this good tradition.    Scharping prepared his trip to the United States  systematically. Largely unnoticed by the government and the  public, he started establishing personal contacts and using the  existing ones after his election as SPD chairman. Only when the  French expressed appreciation of this with the statement by the  French ambassador to Bonn that President Francois Mitterrand  considers Scharping an "excellent man," did the government wake  up painfully. At the security meeting in Munich on 5 February,  Scharping clearly supported the Atlantic orientation in his  speech, which was carefully read in Washington -- and approved  of, as the meeting with Clinton and Christopher showed.    What occasionally seems to be a solo effort by the party  leader is supported by the SPD leadership. Scharping skillfully  combined the different foreign policy schools in a group that  advises him and must therefore be loyal. The group includes  figures like Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, Hans Ulrich Klose,  Norbert Gansel, and Karsten Voigt. For many years, the SPD  presented a picture of a party quarreling over foreign-policy  issues, but now it shows discipline. Nobody "has had to give up  his contours," Scharping claims. However, the picture "again has  a frame and a center." He leaves no doubt as to who the center  is. For simple minds, he quotes a soccer rule: "No discussions  are allowed on the ground."    So far, his coplayers have observed the rule. Scharping  fears only one thing: That one of them might get "dragged into  a discussion" by the CDU whether a government consisting of  Greens and Social Democrats might adopt a different foreign  policy. Those who enter into such a debate "weaken the SPD's  opportunities," he stated with a threatening undertone. Yet  this is exactly what the CDU intends to do, now that the Free  Democratic Party has said it wants to continue the current  coalition, depriving the SPD of one possible constellation for a  coalition. Scharping is aware of the danger that the SPD might  sink together with the Greens in a boat during the election  campaign. Therefore, he announced in the United States that the  Greens' resolutions on NATO and the Bundeswehr are "nonsense" to  which he will never agree.    After his five-day visit to the United States, Scharping  radiates the security of a candidate who feels confident about  his complicated foreign-policy flank. The only time he still  reacts brusquely is when asked about Bundeswehr participation in  international missions. First, the SPD supports all UN  operations that can realistically be expected in the next 10  years, he usually replies. Second, he and the SPD will not back  missions like the Gulf War, and third, he is tired of the  typical German debates about hypothetical reactions to  hypothetical situations. As though trying to dispel all doubts  about his rejection of war missions, Scharping visited the  Vietnam Memorial -- as he always does when he is in Washington.  The names of the over 50,000 soldiers who fell in Vietnam are  engraved in black stone. The polished stone reflects the images  of the visitors. "In this way, one can see one's own picture  when reading the names of the dead," Scharping stated, shaking  his head about those who advocate the participation of the  Bundeswehr in wars.</p>

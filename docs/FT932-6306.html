			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Overseas factors boost UK equities THERE WAS little immediate reaction on the UK stock market to the widely predicted reshuffle of the UK government headed by Mr John Major. The replacement of Mr Norman Lamont by Mr Kenneth Clark as UK chancellor of the exchequer was not unexpected - or even unwelcome - in the City and investors appeared prepared to wait for the first move from his successor, whose pro-ERM views may find a mixed response on the stock market. However, equities took their cue yesterday from a relatively steady performance in sterling and gilt-edged securities. Some analysts commented that Mr Clarke appears less committed to the anti-inflation, hard money, line of his predecessors and that this may make his appointment more acceptable to the equity market than to the gilt-edged sector. However, the gain of 8.4 to 2,855.3 in the FT-SE 100 Index yesterday was inspired by international, rather than domestic, events. Prospects for another early cut in UK base rates remained on much the same rating, hopeful rather than expected. A firm opening in UK shares reflected new peaks overnight in New York and Hong Kong equities, and was sustained by firmness in Tokyo and by a further advance on Wall Street as it opened its new trading session. These factors helped the London market to shrug off a Pounds 199m rights issue from Hammerson, the UK property group. Share prices held their firmer ground for most of the session, with the exception of a brief period when the market became confused as it waited for confirmation of the details of the reshuffle of Mr Major's Cabinet. Once again, it was a trading session driven by corporate news rather than by wider economic factors. Traders reported further buying of the defensive sectors of the stock market, ranging through Britain's overseas earning companies to the domestic brewery stocks which have been hard-driven in recent sessions. Wider uncertainties were reflected by a check to the steady rise in second line issues. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index slipped 5.9 to 3,169.6 in its first daily setback since the middle of last week. Seaq volume increased from Wednesday's 626.8m shares to 660.5m, with non-Seaq business making up about 62 per cent of yesterday's total. Retail, or customer, business was worth Pounds 1.43bn on Wednesday, reaffirming satisfactory levels of profitable business after a brief slowdown earlier this week. Mid-morning brought a sizeable trading programme which appeared to be weighted on the buying side and focused on three important sectors - building, banking and merchant banking and insurance issues. Trading volume was also boosted by the second leg of a batch of large tax deals traded at the close of the previous session. The Footsie was restrained by a reaction in oil shares to the gains of recent sessions and by slower trading among the UK banks. But renewed demand for Reuters, the international global information group, and also for BAT Industries, provided features among the blue chips. The broader range of domestic consumer stocks, still looking for confirmation of recovery in the domestic economy, lacked firm direction.</p>

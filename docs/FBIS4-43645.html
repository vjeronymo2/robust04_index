			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Herta Scharsach: "OeMV Buys Gas Worth 30 Billion </F> Schillings From Russia"]    [Excerpt] An agreement was signed in Moscow last Friday  [17 June] on the long-term supply of Russian natural gas to  Austria. Representatives of the Austrian Petroleum Corporation  [OeMV] and GWH [expansion unknown] (the joint subsidiary of the  OeMV and the Russian foreign trade organization for the sale of  gas, Gazexport) signed a delivery contract worth approximately  30 billion schillings with Gazexport, a subsidiary of the partly  privatized Russian gas concern Gazprom.    Until 31 December 2012, 2.5 billion cubic meters of gas are  to be supplied annually, which is to flow through Slovakia to  the switching point in Baumgarten. The newly drafted delivery  contracts I to III (contract IV covering another 2.5 billion  cubic meters is drafted on a more long-term basis) will become  effective on 1 July 1994.    "The conditions have not changed basically," Christoph  Hiller, who is responsible for gas supplies within the OeMV,  stressed. Austria has been purchasing gas from Russia for about  25 years. Overall annual imports from Russia currently stand at  about 5 billion cubic meters.    To broaden the basis of imports, the purchase of Norwegian  gas was started at the end of 1993. The initial quantity of 300  million cubic meters per year will triple to 1 billion cubic  meters by the year 2002. Austria has an option for another 500  million cubic meters. [passage omitted]</p>

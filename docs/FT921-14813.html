			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Government's home rescue schemes falter THE government's mortgage rescue schemes, announced in recent months to ease the growing problem of house repossessions, have so far failed to get off the ground, it emerged yesterday. Mortgage lenders and housing associations are still reported to be at loggerheads over the mortgages-to-rent scheme which formed the centrepiece of the widely publicised package announced just before Christmas. An earlier scheme to encourage lenders to make empty repossessed homes available to the homeless through housing associations, announced at the start of November, has also failed to make progress. There appears to be little evidence that lenders have eased repossession policies since the pre-Christmas package. Some housing association executives at a seminar organised by the National Federation of Housing Associations suggested that the government had acted hastily in announcing its plan without finalising the details. Under the scheme announced by the chancellor on December 19, the government agreed to pay social security benefits designed to cover mortgage interest direct to the lenders. In return, the lenders agreed to measures aimed at helping homeowners in difficulties and at reducing repossessions by 40,000 this year. These included a less aggressive approach to repossessing the houses of people in arrears and a mortgage-to-rent scheme whereby housing associations would buy homes about to be repossessed and rent them back to their former owners. To make the rents afford-able, the lenders said they would provide almost Pounds 1bn of low-interest loans to the housing associations. The associations say they need funds at rates as low as 5 per cent to enable them to charge afford-able rents. Housing associations - which were not consulted over the package  - have been inundated with requests from homeowners in arrears seeking to join the scheme. But Mr Stephen Duckworth, head of housing finance at the NFHA, told the seminar that only a 'limited number' of associations and lenders had even begun negotiating terms for the loans. One housing association executive said he felt that the lenders, having achieved the direct payment of social security benefits, had now lost interest in delivering their part of the bargain. Another executive, Mr Bill Payne of the Yorkshire Metropolitan Housing Association, said there was 'a chasm' between the interest rates housing associations could afford to pay and the interest rates lenders wanted to charge. 'I wonder whether it isn't all a political move to take the problem off the agenda until after the general election,' he said. Few lenders appear to have changed their policies since the government announcement.</p>

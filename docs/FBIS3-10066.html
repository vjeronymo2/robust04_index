			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As of now, public and private sector salaries will  be adjusted by the same rule, that is, the variation in the URV  [real value unit]. The following are the new rules for  adjustment of salaries:    Private sector salaries will be adjusted by the average  value  of the past four months. The value in URV's may not be lower  than the February payment. Only the basic salary will be  adjusted, excluding fringe benefits and additional holiday  payments.    The minimum salary will also be adjusted by the average  value. It will stand at about $64 at the end of March. On the  date of actual payment, this amount will correspond to  approximately 58,000 real cruzeiros.    Anyone hired less than four month ago will have his salary  adjusted by the value paid to employees at the same level.    The same adjustment rule will apply to public servants'  salaries, while in addition they will obtain an increase of 5  percent which will apply for February only. Paychecks will be  issued in URV's, while income tax discounts will be calculated  in UFIR's [reference fiscal units]. The FGTS [Severance Pay  Fund] will be calculated in URV's, to be converted into real  cruzeiros on the day it is deposited.    Workers who are dismissed without justification will be paid  an additional amount equivalent to 50 percent of their salaries.    As of now, anyone hired will have his salary fixed in URV's.    With the new salary policy, public servant salaries will not  be adjusted in March, as they would have been under the current  policy. This is an initial loss which, according to Federal  Administration Secretary Romildo Canhim, will be compensated for.    [Begin Canhim recording] This temporary loss will be  practically neutralized by a government decision to grant a  bonus in February and a small increase in the salary base. [end  recording]    Compensation for salary deterioration for private sector  workers will be arranged through free negotiations. This is  progress, according to Labor Minister Walter Barelli, who  unsuccessfully tried to set the minimum salary level at $100.    [Begin Barelli recording] The battle was hard, but  compensation has been obtained. A decree will be issued today  creating a commission to increase the minimum salary by 50  percent in real terms during the rest of this government's term.  [end recording]    The commission created to find ways to increase the minimum  salary has 60 days to conclude its work. Its members are  representatives of the Labor, Social Security, Planning, and  Finance Ministries, and of the Federal Administration  Secretariat.    If Minister Barelli's proposal is accepted the minimum  salary  will stand at approximately $100 at the beginning of 1995.  Today the minimum salary is equivalent to approximately 61,000  real cruzeiros.</p>

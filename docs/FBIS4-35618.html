			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Ottawa, 29 May (KUNA) -- Ahmad 'Abd-al-Aziz  Sa'dun, speaker of the National Assembly, has said that Kuwait  does not fear the emergence of extremist religious movements  like those that exist in a number of Arab states.    In an interview on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, CBC,  radio he said that "as long as there is democracy,  participation, freedom of expression, and a free press," in  addition to "our open society which allows all sides to be heard  and to put forward their points of view, this prevents any form  of extremism."    Sa'dun was replying to a question on whether Kuwait fears  Islamic extremism. He said that Kuwaiti society "adheres to  religion and abides by Islam, but in this case you are talking  about political organizations which are actually present  throughout the Arab homeland." He stated that the present  National Assembly "represents all strata of Kuwaiti society and  all political, social, and other groups."    He said that there is a trend toward widening the electoral  base in Kuwait through a number of proposals "which have been on  the table for some time and on which views differ," such as  granting women the right to vote, lowering the voting age to 18,  giving naturalized Kuwaitis the right to vote, and granting the  right to vote to certain nationals who are resident abroad  because of the nature of their work, such as ambassadors,  members of the diplomatic corps, students, and military  personnel.    He said: "We are a democratic country" and accept what is  adopted by the majority. "Whatever the trend on any of these  issues, I personally am not concerned when the vote in the  National Assembly goes against my own preference." [passage  omitted]    The National Assembly speaker said that the greatest  achievement in Kuwait since its liberation from Iraqi occupation  has been parliamentary elections and the restoration of  democracy. He said that this emphasized "the nature of the  situation in Kuwait, the nature of the ruling system in Kuwait,  and the nature of the Kuwaiti people, who must have a role in  managing the affairs of their country and in  self-determination."

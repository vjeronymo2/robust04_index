			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524): </F> "Resorting to Deception in Statistical Work Can Never Be  Allowed"]    [Text] Beijing, 13 Jun (XINHUA) -- The nationwide  inspection of the enforcement of the statistics law has begun.  The inspection not only has great significance for ensuring the  state's scientific decisions and modern management, but will  also definitely make great contributions to laying a legal  foundation for the country's statistical work.    Since the "Statistics Law" was promulgated and put into  force  more than a decade ago, statistical work has played an  increasingly important role in the country's  macro-decisionmaking and macroeconomic regulation and control.  This year is an important one for building a socialist market  economic system. Following the implementation of a series of  major reform measures, some interest setups formed in the past  have changed and many problems have arisen as a result of the  readjustments of interests. Therefore, the situation demands  that we build a macroeconomic regulation and control system in  line with the development of the market economy as soon as  possible, and strive to refine the system. The basic function  of statistical work is to conduct statistical surveys and  analyses of economic and social development to faithfully  reflect the actual situation; and to provide objective,  accurate, and reliable information for making scientific  decisions and for formulating macroeconomic regulation and  control measures.    According to information provided by the State Statistics  Bureau, over the last few years, the nation's important  statistical data as a whole has objectively reflected the trends  and changes in the nation's economic performance and has  basically been accurate. However, it must be pointed out that  individual localities, departments, and some units have a poor  understanding of the statistics law; some of them have even  ignored it and falsified statistical data. In particular, they  have resorted to deception in preparing indicators that reflect  their work performance -- radically violating the party's  ideological line of seeking truth from facts, damaging the  party's good traditions and style, and disturbing reform,  opening up, and the development of the socialist market economy.  If this mistake of extreme egoism and regional protectionism is  allowed to spread, the country's scientific decisions and  macroeconomic regulation and control are bound to lose reliable  ground, which will have a disastrous affect on the healthy  development of the nation's economy.    People in economic circles have pointed out: Currently, the  prominent characteristic of fraudulent practice in statistical  work is to use falsified data to win either personal or a small  group's political honor and to favor their economic interests.  For instance, to show their "work performance," the leaders of  a certain county asked their agriculture bureau to increase  peasants' per-capita net income from 188 yuan to 204 yuan. But,  when they learned that the higher authorities had decided to  treat counties in which peasants' per-capita net income was less  than 200 yuan as counties eligible to receive impoverishment  relief aid, they again asked the statistics and agriculture  bureau to change the per-capita net income to 183 yuan and  submit it to departments concerned in order to be awarded an  impoverishment relief fund. In another example, in an attempt  to make their county the province's first to double its total  industrial and agricultural output value, the leaders of a  certain county fabricated a string of figures for announcement  by the news media, causing a very bad influence.    Fraudulent practice in statistical work is by no means an  ordinary violation of discipline in economic life -- its  damaging and corroding effects are extremely serious. When  commenting on this matter, a leader of the National People's  Congress Standing Committee seriously pointed out that we must  have adequate understanding of the serious damage caused to  society by this law-violating act, and that we should  unrelentingly investigate cases of this kind. A person in  charge of the State Council stressed: The news media should  timely expose cases that have caused a bad influence. We should  educate a large number of people with each case exposed. We  should respect facts at any time and under any circumstances --  this is the fundamental principle our party has always upheld,  our party's lifeline. We can expect that, through the current  inspection of enforcement of the statistics law, new progress  will be made in laying a legal foundation for the country's  statistical work.</p>

			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALL-SPORTS NEWSPAPER KICKS OFF AS INDUSTRY WATCHES FROM SIDELINES  </P> <P> Even before it prints its maiden edition today, the much awaited daily sports  newspaper called the National already may have subtracted from the quality of  sports journalism in America.  </P> <P> At least to the extent that it has taken Frank Deford away from writing long,  inventive feature pieces for Sports Illustrated.  </P> <P> Instead, Deford, who is arguably the country's premier sports writer, is the  National's editor-in-chief, chief architect, top spokesman and also its TV  pitchman in ads hawking the paper's launch today in Los Angeles, New York and  Chicago. But his writing will be limited to a once-a-week column.  </P> <P> What lured him and what has piqued the curiosity of the publishing industry is  the prospect of the first nationwide newspaper devoted exclusively to sports.  And it also may be a chance to test what could be a new direction in American  newspapers -- narrow-interest publications aimed at attracting people who don't  read other daily newspapers.  </P> <P> Two somewhat limited attempts to start all-sports newspapers in this country  failed in the 1980s, including one by the Pasadena Star News under then-owner  Knight Ridder.  </P> <P> But Deford and his crew believe that they can duplicate the success of the  sports dailies thriving in Europe and Latin America by having circulation sales  instead of advertising drive the paper. The strategy, unusual in the United  States, relies heavily on editorial strength, such as Deford's.  </P> <P> The National already caused tremors of worry and expectation in the journalism  fraternity last summer when Deford managed to nab several marquee sports  writers, among them Scott Ostler of the Los Angeles Times, Mike Lupica of the  New York Daily News and Dave Kindred of the Atlanta Constitution, along with  two Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporters.  </P> <P> It also has the considerable finances of elusive Mexican television magnate  Emilio Azcarraga, plus the skills of Deford's former Princeton classmate, Peter  Price, the former publisher of the New York Post.  </P> <P> What they have produced is a Sunday- through-Friday tabloid of about 48 pages,  a local section for each city edition with one long feature each day, a SWAT  team of columnists -- and so many tables and statistics that hockey fans can  track the "power-play efficiency" of every team daily.  </P> <P> The fundamental question implicit is how deep is America's appetite for sports  -- when fans already can watch ESPN at night, get the local paper in the  morning, then USA Today, and once a week the Sporting News and Sports  Illustrated. Price, the publisher, is hoping to guarantee an initial  circulation of 200,000-250,000 from the first three cities, and plans to be in  12 more by year-end.  </P> <P> Yet there is also the broader question here about where newspapers are headed.  </P> <P> Younger Americans are not turning to newspapers as they grow up the way  previous generations did. The National is built in part on the theory that some  of those who get their news from television may still turn to reading every day  if the newspaper is focused on their specialized interests.  </P> <P> If so, targeted or niche-market newspapers -- by demographic group, subject  matter, age, etc. -- might signal the direction of newspapers in the next  century.  </P> <P> Publicly, even Price is estimating that the paper may need five years and $100  million to make a profit. Azcarraga, who is paying most of the bills, avoids  publicity.  </P> <P> "It is a well-thought-out approach," said John Reidy, the publishing analyst  with Drexel Burnham Lambert. "But the real thing is getting the readers."  </P> <P> Certainly there are enormous risks. For one, skeptics note that USA Today has  yet to turn an annual profit, with losses estimated around $600 million since  its launch in September, 1982 -- not counting the costs Gannett absorbed by  borrowing staff and resources from its 80-plus local papers.  </P> <P> While it has circulation -- roughly 1.4 million as of last September -- USA  Today does not have enough advertising. One reason is that the national  advertising market for print has weakened, perhaps permanently, with several  categories such as liquor and tobacco never returning to the levels of the late  1970s.  </P> <P> Price said the National is predicated on a delicate strategy that might avoid  this problem: He wants to build the paper's cost structure so that it can  survive largely on circulation, not advertising.  </P> <P> This would make it more in the manner of a European paper, which might get 70%  of revenue from circulation and only about 30% from ads.  </P> <P> In the United States, the structure of newspapers is just the opposite --  largely because American papers are home delivered and contain so many pages  that they are more expensive to produce than European papers. As a rule, the 25  cents that the reader plunks down doesn't even cover the cost of the newsprint.  Advertising must make up the rest.  </P> <P> To break the cycle, a newspaper would have to be thin, which would mean it  could contain less news.  </P> <P> But as a specialized publication, the National is hoping that at 48 pages it  can both be the most in-depth provider of sports news and still be small enough  that its newsprint costs will be low. Price says newsprint will only cost him  about 10 cents a copy.  </P> <P> To keep distribution costs low as well, it has contracted with Dow Jones,  publisher of the national Wall Street Journal, to deliver the paper to  newsstands.  </P> <P> Even if it is eventually profitable, Price said he expects the National not to  get more than 50% of revenue from advertising.  </P> <P> So far, ad commitments are impressive, analysts report, but at less than  $10,000 for a full-color national page and less than $4,000 for a local page,  the National is cheap to buy.  </P> <P> "I think it could be done, but I would have believed this strategy more if they  were selling for a higher newsstand price than 50 cents," said Ken Noble, a  publishing analyst with the brokerage firm Paine Webber.  </P> <P> With this approach, "the most important thing will be to get enough readers,"  said John Morton, a newspaper industry analyst with the brokerage firm of  Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan.  </P> <P> Even a quarter of a million readers won't do it, even just for three cities,  said Reidy.  </P> <P> One result of the strategy, though, is that the National is largely driven by  the journalism. Of the 175 member staff, an extraordinary 125 are reporters and  editors.  </P> <P> In an earlier era, the Wall Street Journal was analogous, specialized enough to  be thorough in only a few pages. Yet as its readership grew, so did its  advertising, and now its cost structure is advertising-driven like most of the  rest of American media.  </P> <P> And the Wall Street Journal in the beginning had little competition, since most  business sections were a newspaper's backwater, hidden behind the sports pages  and the tire ads.  </P> <P> There is intense competition facing the National -- from strong local sports  coverage in newspapers, to ESPN's all sports channel on cable TV, to sports  phones, CNN and USA Today, which already produces the most detailed sports  section in the country.  </P> <P> To distinguish itself, the National's statistics and reports are even more  detailed. A key question about the paper's success is how much more people  really want.  </P> <P> If the National is right that people do want still more, USA Today could be one  of those hardest hit. For despite recent statements to the contrary from  officials at USA Today, sources closely familiar with USA Today's internal  research said its fine sports section is one of the primary reasons people buy  that paper.  </P> <P> Another problem is whether the National can survive entirely on street sales in  an industry built on home delivery.  </P> <P> One of the National's ads for Southern California, for instance, notes that  "there are only six newsstands in L.A. County," and pleads to viewers, "You  guys are going to have to help us."  </P> <P> Without intending to, the ad also highlights still another problem. One of the  keys to whether the National succeeds will be how well it mixes local copy --  the Southern California edition includes coverage of all the local teams and a  separate local columnist each day -- into an essentially national publication.  </P> <P> Can a central desk in New York be so multi-regional? The ad about Los Angeles  sounds just a bit dismissive, as if it were written by a smug New Yorker: "You  come out of your house, get into the car, pull into an underground garage, go  up into the office, never breathing the smog."  </P> <P> In Azcarraga, the most important figure in Spanish language television, the  National is backed by one of the richest men in the world and one with a  reputation for taking a long-term view of his investments.  </P> <P> In hiring Deford, the National also hit a home run. Then Deford and Price  followed with a strategy that has made the paper the most anticipated venture  in newspaper publishing since USA Today.  </P> <P> After saying nothing publicly about the paper at first, all at once Deford made  extravagant offers to some of the best-known sports writers in America,  including Jim Murray and Ostler of The Times. Among those hired, reportedly  doubling salaries and guaranteeing multi-year contracts in some cases, were  Ostler, Lupica, Kindred and John Feinstein, who struck it rich writing a book  about basketball coach Bobby Knight. Then he hired two highly regarded sports  editors, Van McKenzie of the Atlanta Journal and Constitution and Vince Doria  of the Boston Globe.  </P> <P> That was carefully thought out to get journalists to say, " 'If these people  are talking to all of these people at once, what the hell is this thing,' "  said Deford, a writer who, as a star of Lite Beer commercials and a veteran of  10 book tours, had a fine understanding of the black art of promotion. "They  had to take us seriously."  </P> <P> Nor is the National, as USA Today Managing Editor for Sports Gene Policinski  has dismissively suggested, mostly long stories. The bulk of it is statistics  and short reports, gossip, facts and factoids ad infinitum -- or ad nauseam.  </P> <P> All together, the National resembles USA Today more than Deford's alma mater,  Sports Illustrated.  </P> <P> It even has a color weather map, with the various stadium sites listed and  weather forecasts for key games.  </P></p>

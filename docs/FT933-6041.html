			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Sale of RTZ's Nerco assets to fetch Dollars 600m RTZ CORPORATION, the world's biggest mining company, is putting the finishing touches to the sale of assets acquired only in June when it bought Nerco, the floundering US natural resources group, and says total proceeds will be about Dollars 600m (Pounds 405m). That compares with RTZ's outlay of Dollars 470m plus the assumption of Dollars 692m debt when it bought Nerco which was 82 per cent owned by PacifiCorp of the US. Also, RTZ's cash outlay was reduced to Dollars 245m by a loan from PacifiCorp to be repaid from Nerco contract revenues. One of the outstanding details RTZ previously has held back concerns the expected proceeds from the sale of the Con gold mine in Canada's North West Territories. However, it now says it expects this will bring at least Dollars 25m. When RTZ first announced in February that it was negotiating to buy Nerco it made clear that it wanted only Nerco's coal operations in the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming. Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, was retained to offload Nerco's oil and gas interests and definitive agreements for their sale to two US energy groups, Western Gas Resources and Louisiana Land and Exploration Company for a total of Dollars 510m were announced in July. Even before that, arrangements had been made to sell Nerco's gold and silver mines - which Nerco had previously decided to put on the market. Minorco, the Luxembourg-quoted overseas investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, is paying Dollars 21m cash for Nerco's Pikes Peak Mining Company which owns 80 per cent of the Cripple Creek mine in Colorado. And Kinross Gold, a US group, is paying Dollars 16.8m cash for the DeLamar gold-silver mine in south-west Idaho and the Candelaria silver mine in western Nevada. RTZ says negotiations are in progress about the sale of the Con gold mine to Red Lion Management, a private Vancouver-based conglomerate controlled by Mr Walter Berukoff. Red Lion has arranged to sell on the Con mine to Miramar Mining, another Vancouver company. Red Lion says it exercised its option to buy the Con on August 15 and has 60 days from that time to complete the acquisition. RTZ also expects to raise Pounds 900m from the sale of its Pillar industrial division, mainly to MB-Caradon, which, with the Nerco disposals, will reduced the group's gearing to 14 per cent compared with the 63 per cent to which it briefly rose after the Nerco acquisition.</p>

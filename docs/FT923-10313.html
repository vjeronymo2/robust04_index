			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Letter: Power prices probe needed Sir, I was glad to read your report 'Regulator to probe power prices' (July 28). In common with all major industrial users I hope his probing is more vigorous than previously and has a longer term effect. It is quite clear that the generators are once again manipulating the market. I can indeed confirm your report of the amount of the increase, there having been a rise in pool prices from 1.998p to 2.364p since February. This is a rise of 20 per cent, and only six months after the generators last had their knuckles wrapped by the regulator for exactly the same malpractice. One is bound to question the effectiveness of the regulator's control over them. For industry to be facing any increase in power costs in these deeply recessionary times is outrageous. Until the whole question of electricity supply is investigated by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission I believe the situation will continue to be very unsatisfactory. Andrew Cook, chairman, William Cook, Parkway Avenue, Sheffield S9 4WA</p>

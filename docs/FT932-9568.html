			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Letter: Champions aim to unify export efforts Sir, Your leader of April 26 ('Mr Heseltine's magic lantern') commented that 'government selection of 'national champions', even in the limited context of bids for export contracts, is a tricky game'. In fact, we are not going back to the bad old days of government picking winners. What we are doing is working with industry so that British companies are unified against foreign competition in export markets rather than squabbling among themselves. These efforts will be headed in each important sector by a senior figure. That is what I mean by a national champion. There is enormous strength in British industry which we can exploit effectively overseas if we all work together. What we are about is backing winners. Richard Needham, minister for trade, Department of Trade and Industry, Ashdown House, 123 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6RB</p>

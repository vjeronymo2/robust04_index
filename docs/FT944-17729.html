			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zambia to advance sale of copper miner Zambia's mines minister Paul Kapinga said yesterday that the government would bring forward the proposed privatisation of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, reports Reuters from Lusaka. He said this would end speculation on whether the major mining company would be sold or not. 'We are bringing forward the sale of ZCCM from the last tranche to other earlier tranches so that it could be sold much earlier than previously arranged,' the minister told reporters. But he did not say how soon. According to the Zambia Privatisation Agency, no timetable had yet been set under the tranche sales programme for the privatisation of ZCCM, which is 60.3 per cent government owned, and several other strategic enterprises. Mr Kapinga said the government favoured privatising ZCCM as a single entity rather than unbundling it into five separate ones as recommended by foreign consultants. Deputy mines minister Mr Mathias Mphande said last month he favoured unbundling because potential shareholders could find it difficult to raise the estimated USDollars 3bn needed for rehabilitation and new projects in the next three years.</p>

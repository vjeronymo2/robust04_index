			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Voronkov] </F>   [Text] London June 16 TASS -- The "contact group",  comprising Russia, the United States and the European Union is  holding a working session in the British capital today in its  bid to work out a peaceful solution to the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and its future constitutional and territorial  set up. Russian presidential special envoy and Deputy Foreign  Minister Vitaliy Churkin is taking part in the meeting.    The British Foreign Office told ITAR-TASS that all parties  at  the session are striving to agree to the last details of the  "geographical division" map of the Former Republic of  Yugoslavia. The whole package is to be approved at a  minister-level meeting of Russia, the U.S., Great Britain,  France and Germany, which is scheduled to take place within the  next two to three weeks.    Later the documents, which are in informed circles regarded  as ultimatums of their own kind, will be handed over to the  Serbs, Croats and Moslems, the hostile sides in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The range of the issues discussed by the  "contact group" is extremely complicate, the British Foreign  Office representative noted. For this reason, the possibility  of the talks being extended until friday cannot be ruled out, he  indicated.    According to British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, the  international committee has only a few days left at its disposal  to put an end to the Bosnian conflict. Speaking in London on  Wednesday, Hurd noted that there exists a real danger of a new  war braking out in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which may spill over  beyond its borders.</p>

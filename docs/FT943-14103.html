			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: Greece to privatise parts of DEP units Greece is to privatise a minority stake in subsidiaries belonging to the state-owned Public Petroleum Corporation (DEP), Reuter reports from Athens. 'The government has decided to float a minority share in subsidiaries of DEP via the stock exchange without transferring strategic decisions to private individuals,' said Mr Andreas Papandreou, prime minister. Earlier this year Mr Manolis Daskalakis, DEP's managing director, said between 20 and 25 per cent of EKO refinery and Hellenic Aspropyrgos Refinery (ELDA) would be floated on stock markets in Greece and abroad, including New York. The part-sales, which would also include an unspecified percentage of DEP itself, would begin by early 1995, Mr Daskalakis said. DEP's 1993 pre-tax profits were Dr25.1bn (Dollars 108.2m) and the company is expected to top Dr30bn this year. Greece's socialist government, which came to power last October, has said it is willing to float minority stakes in state companies but will retain management of the enterprises. A 25 per cent stake in Greek Telecommunications is scheduled to be floated on to the stock market.</p>

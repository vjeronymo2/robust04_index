			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Once again there are pickets outside the government  building in Moscow. This time it is defense sector workers who  are picketing.    [Correspondent Dmitriy Matyushkin] Once again there are  tanks  outside the White House, but this time they are only toy ones.  As you can see, conversion is fully under way. However,  without state support, defense enterprises have fallen into  debt. Defense sector workers set up a picket today outside the  White House. They were demanding that, taking account of  inflation, the debt to defense sector enterprises for fulfilled  state orders be settled, that the amount of nontaxable spending  on pay be increased, and also that enterprises be compensated  for losses relating to conversion.    According to the statistics of the defense sector unions, on  1 April, the Ministry of Defense's arrears in paying for state  orders was 154 billion rubles. Payment of wages is often  delayed for three months. Lastly, the cash-flow problem of  defense enterprises has virtually brought whole towns and works  to a halt. Representatives of defense industry unions have  accused the government primarily of not fulfilling the  obligations of an agreement between sectors. In their view, the  majority of specific proposals for stabilizing the sector have  had no response.</p>

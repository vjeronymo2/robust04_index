			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Observer: Cost of carry? Do the problems of dual technology extend to stock exchanges? That is one for Milan's chamber of commerce, which wants to donate a temporary building to the Palestinians - on condition that the thing is used as a bourse. The 'little cage', as it is known to the Italian brokers who have occupied it since 1987, is to be vacated shortly when rebuilding is complete on the grand Palazzo Mezzanotte (Midnight) where the market has its permanent home. Portable stock markets are obviously much sought after by certain sorts of country; a Baltic republic has already expressed interest in the edifice. But the authorities would prefer to dispatch all four walls in the direction of Gaza - 'in the cause of peace'. Amid these heart-warming sentiments, the Milanese retain a certain pragmatism, however. If a Palestinian authority is not forthcoming 'within a non-biblical period of time', they will regretfully have to seek a buyer, they say.</p>

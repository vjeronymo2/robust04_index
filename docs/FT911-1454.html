			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Revival of HK special share plan thwarted A SENIOR official in the Hong Kong stock exchange has been thwarted in his bid to reintroduce special share allocations to members of the exchange's ruling council. His attempt has renewed concerns about the credibility of the colony's financial markets. Mr Philip Wong, senior vice chairman and tipped to become chairman in October, last week asked the council to recognise the preferential allocation of shares to council members and to call an extraordinary general meeting to authorise the practice for future listings in Hong Kong. Both proposals were passed at a hastily convened council meeting by 10 votes to five. The practice, widely seen as open to abuse, was stopped in 1988 following the arrest of Mr Ronald Li, former chairman, and six other former stock exchange officials on bribery charges. Mr Li was jailed for four years last October and faces a second trial with the others later this year for accepting preferential share allocations in 1987. The Securities and Futures Commission, alarmed by Mr Wong's proposal, intervened with the help of Sir QW Lee, exchange chairman, who had been absent from the meeting. At a second meeting on Thursday the proposals were overturned by 11 votes to five. One member who voted against the proposals said they were potentially very damaging to Hong Kong's image as a financial centre. He said their adoption would undermine the improvements to Hong Kong's reputation made since the arrest and conviction of Mr Li. 'The council is the ultimate arbiter of listings. Giving council members special privileges would make their position very difficult,' the member said. Mr Wong has also said for the first time that he accepted preferential share allocations when he was a member of the exchange committee under Mr Li in 1987. In a letter sent to council members dated April 25, he said: 'I took up allocations of new listings in several companies in the course of that year, in numbers greater than those allocated to ordinary members.' Mr Wong said in the letter that he was making his statement because the government and the SFC were pressing him to resign from the council over the 1987 share allocations. He claimed the practice of accepting shares was well known at the time and the SFC, which is in conflict with the exchange on several topics, was using the information to discredit him. He called for the practice to be renewed to stop his name being blackened. Mr Wong worked under Mr Li for several years as a computer expert in the mid-1980s. Since Mr Li's arrest, and with strong backing from local stockbrokers, he has risen quickly through the exchange ranks. He is thought to be considering standing for election to the colony's Legislative Council as candidate of the Peking-backed Chinese Chamber of Commerce, suggesting he has good links with the mainland.</p>

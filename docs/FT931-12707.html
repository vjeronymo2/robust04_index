			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Danish tanker fire out SALVAGE tugboats yesterday were reported to have extinguished the fire that had burned for five days on the Danish supertanker Maersk Navigator, AP writes from Singapore. The ship had been involved in a collision at the northerly entrance to the Strait of Malacca last Thursday. Foam sprayed by the tugs smothered the blazing crude oil gushing from the 255,000 tonne tanker, according to a statement issued by AP Moller, owner of the ship. A terse message from the Dutch salvage company Smit Tak, hired by Moller, said: 'Foam attack was successful and now cooling. All resources standing by in case of a flare-up. Preparing for oil pollution control.' Pollution experts flying over the stricken ship said it was spilling oil more slowly. However, a 35-mile-long, mile-wide slick has drifted to within 10 miles of the coral-ringed southern coast of India's Great Nicobar Island. 'Our coastguards are on full alert. We are closely watching the slick,' the Indian environment minister Kamal Nath said.</p>

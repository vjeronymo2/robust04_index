Voting results: 228 - for, 21 against and 19 abstained.    The government is to proceed from approved budget plans for  1994 in financing federal budget spending. The Central Bank  should offer a 10.6 trillion ruble credit to the government to  cover the budget deficit. The credit is for 10 years with  repayment in equal installments beginning with 1998 at 10  interest.    The following limits on current spending on federal  government bodies were set to restrict expenditures: the office  of the president - 82,000 Mn, the Council of the Federation -  11,303 Mn, the State Duma - 27,754 Mn, the government - 15,180  Mn. By the 30th of May, June and July the government is to  submit a monthly report on federal budget spending in the  previous month .    According to speaker Ivan Rybkin, the law approved by the  Duma is going to be submitted to the upper house of parliament  on Wednesday. He hoped that the Council of the Federation would  hold a session on Thursday and pass the law so that "the  president would have it on his table on Monday".</p>

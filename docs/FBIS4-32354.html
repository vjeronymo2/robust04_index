			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, June 21 (BTA) -- Representatives of the two  major political forces in Bulgaria: The Bulgarian Socialist  Party (BSP, the former Communists) and the opposition Union of  Democratic Forces (SDS) elaborated on their parties' stands on  the census in the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM].    "SDS is anxious about the census. Despite the large number  of foreign observers, we are apprehensive that the population of  the Republic of Macedonia lacks the democratic psychological and  political environment required for free expression," said Mr.  Asparukh Panov, deputy chairman of the National Coordinating  Council of SDS and member of the parliamentary Foreign Policy  Committee. SDS is skeptical mainly because of the considerable  politicization of the ruling Macedonian Socialist Party which  organizes the census taking and because of the fuelling of  anti-Bulgarian attitudes, evidently to be used in the  forthcoming election campaign.    "As a political force we have always maintained an explicit  and resolute stand on Macedonia, which we took in 1992 when the  SDS government recognized that country's independence," Mr.  Panov pointed out. He added that SDS firmly believes that a  sovereign, independent Macedonia is a guarantor of balance and  stability in the Balkans.    "The Bulgarian Socialist Party is the only political force  which two years ago refused to applaud the recognition of the  Republic of Macedonia which was no doubt a hasty action, said  BSP leader Zhan Videnov in response to a reporter's question  about the census in Macedonia. According to Mr. Videnov, the  problems with the language, the historical inheritance and the  `Bulgarian' option in the census forms were bound to arise.    ``We shall always defend the Bulgarian history, the  Bulgarian  national spirit, Bulgarian cultural and historical sites and we  hope that Macedonia would respond to our open and democratic  policy in a similar manner,'' Mr. Panov pointed out.    Mr. Videnov is apprehensive about possible territorial  claims  and arguments between Bulgaria and Macedonia. The two states  have a profoundly different concept of national security. "To  Skopje national security is guaranteed by the presence of  foreign military forces on the republic's territory, while  Bulgaria seeks to achieve it through balanced and peaceful  relations with its neighbours and integration with the European  and world security structures," he explained. In his opinion,  many chances for preventive settlement of problems between  Bulgaria and Macedonia have been missed in the past two years  and it is the respective state institutions that are to be held  responsible and not the ones who were warning against the  complications threatening to ensue from the involved  configurations in the Balkans.</p>

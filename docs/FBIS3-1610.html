			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 27 (XINHUA) -- China's economic  growth has advanced at double-digit speed for the past two years.    The country's inflation rate climbed to 13 percent  nationwide  last year. When the central government unveiled its fiscal  reforms and unified the exchange rate at the start of 1994, it  declared war against inflation by repeated pledges of tighter  control on credit and money supply as well as on investment in  fixed assets.    The question is, however, will China's battle against  inflation be successful?    The inflationary pressure is obvious with last year's 1,300  billion yuan spent on fixed assets, excessive money supply over  the past few years and the bigger-than-ever stride in price  reforms in 1993.    Meanwhile, higher production costs will force some  enterprises to raise the prices of their products in order to  maintain a balanced book. A vicious cycle is thus set.    The biggest pressure comes from local enthusiasms to start  more construction projects, and with last year's projects to be  continued and new ones started, the central bank faces mounting  pressure to issue more money.    But this year the central government indicates a strong  determination to fight against inflation. It must do so because  it wants the economic boom to continue. It also needs a good  economic and social environment to push ahead reforms in other  fields, including state enterprises, investment system as well  as finance.    Therefore, the central authorities target this year's growth  at around 9 percent, hoping to achieve a "soft landing" of some  kind.    Meanwhile, the central bank has repeatedly vowed to keep a  tighter rein on credit and money supply in the new year.  According to central bank sources, the total money supply for  1994 will not exceed last year's level; the increase in bank  lending will be kept on a par with that of last year, which  means a reduced rate of credit increase.    Recently, a senior official of the central bank disclosed  that the central bank had no intention of making changes in  interest rates in the foreseeable future.    After two rises in 1993, the interest rate for one-year  deposits stands at a relatively high level of 10.8 percent.    A month earlier, the State Council issued a circular,  demanding a strict grip on fixed asset investment. It stressed  that the government would, in principle, not allow new  construction projects to start this year.    Coupled with the State Council's move, the central bank has  worked out a set of rules for banks across the country to  follow, which feature tougher conditions for extending loans for  fixed assets investment. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is also  the central bank governor, told the banks not to provide loans  to unauthorized projects, while the credit quotas must not  exceed the planned figure.    To reach an understanding between the central government and  different areas, "keeping the general balance in demand and  supply while maintaining a relatively high growth" is expected  to become one of the main points of discussion during the  National People's Congress due to open on March 10.    This year, the government will limit bond issuing by  localities and enterprises. The securities authorities have  also banned enterprises from issuing shares to their employees.  Therefore, all fund-raising activities will become more  difficult in 1994.    As part of reform efforts, starting this year, the state  treasury deficits can only be made up by issuing state bonds,  instead of overdrafts from the central bank; the establishment  of policy-oriented banks will leave little ground for the  specialized banks to ask for more money supply under the excuse  of extending loans to state designated projects. Both these  measures will help reduce the central bank's money supply.    Observers here say that in building up a market economy, the  top leadership is assuming a stronger macro-regulatory role in  fine-tuning the economy. The successes of last year's  macro-economic control and the prompt intervention of the  central government in stabilizing grain prices in December  proved that the authorities have the will and the means to keep  the economic development on a right track.    Most economists in Beijing expect that the momentum of price  increases will be gradually reduced when the state  anti-inflation measures are implemented.    Hyper-inflation can be avoided if agriculture enjoys another  bumper harvest this year and there is no sharp fluctuation in  the renminbi exchange rate, economists agree.    "The central government's anti-inflation efforts will have  paid off if the year-round inflation rate can be contained  within 12 percent in 1994," analysts said.</p>

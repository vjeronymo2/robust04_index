			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Media Futures: Demos calls for regulator for communications OfCom - responsible for all telecommunications and broadcasting networks is one of the core proposals in a newly-published analysis of the social and political implications of information technology. It comes from Demos, a radical think-tank, whose advisory council includes John Ashworth, director of the London School of Economics, and Martin Taylor, chief executive of Barclays Bank. Its views are expressed in a series of articles published both on paper and on the Internet. Geoff Mulgan, its director, says in an introductory essay that regulatory structures in UK communications have become too complex, and that the regulation of networks should be consolidated into an Office of Communications: 'The core of OfCom should take the form of a commission, with open recruitment and hearings before a select committee on the membership and chair,' he writes. Its primary goal should be the achievement of satisfaction, or welfare, among the public, he says, with competition as a means, not an end. He advocates a separate regulator responsible for taste and content in the cinema, press, television and video worlds. Martin Cave, professor of economics at Brunel University and a special adviser to Britain's existing telecommunications regulator, raises questions in a further essay about the way a combined regulator might operate: 'The key lies in the recognition that communication services involve a series of stages, beginning with creation of the message, in some cases involving a bundling or wholesale function and culminating in delivery to final consumers. The regulator should seek to examine the degree of dominance at any stage in the process, and in the case of bottlenecks for essential facilities, mandate access, institute price control arrangements or take alternative actions.'

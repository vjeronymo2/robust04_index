			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Rate rise fears fade but markets still wary Fears of an imminent rise in UK official interest rates receded yesterday, but financial markets continued to signal that they expect an increase in the next two months. Indications strengthened that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, agreed to leave base rates unchanged at 5.25 per cent at their monthly monetary meeting last Thursday. They will next meet to discuss interest rates on September 7, but an indication of the Bank's views on the economy will emerge today when it publishes its quarterly inflation report. Yesterday, the Bank dealt at existing money market rates, reassuring those who feared a base rate increase at the start of the trading week. The equity market responded with relief, pushing the FT-SE 100 index up 14.8 points to 3,097.4. But the mood in the money markets remained wary. Although there was a small rally in short sterling, the futures market's medium for speculating on interest rate changes, the contract continued to imply that short-term rates would be nearly 6 per cent by the middle of September. Three-month interbank offer rates also remained well above base rates, at 5 3/4 per cent. Speculation of an immediate rate rise reached fever pitch last Friday after the Bank decided to accept bids at an auction of three-month Treasury bills at rates of up to 5.75 per cent. Traders saw this as a sign that base rates were set to rise, even though the Bank, in its normal money market operations on Friday, left dealing rates unchanged. Unless interbank rates drop sharply, the Bank will face a repeat of last week's dilemma on Friday, when the next Treasury bill auction occurs. It will either have to accept bids at a level well above base rates or take the unusual step of cancelling the auction. Last Friday, the Bank decided that its actions were the less damaging of the two approaches. Analysts said the divergence between Treasury bill rates and base rates could not last for long, and the gap was likely to be closed by an increase in the latter. Friday's events have left the government 'chasing, rather than controlling' the process, said Mr Peter Lyon, global strategist at securities house Smith New Court.

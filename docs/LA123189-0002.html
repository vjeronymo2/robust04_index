			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES TO TAPE  </P> <P> The Big Street (TNT Sunday at 9:05 a.m.): Lucille Ball's favorite among her  dramatic films is this endearing 1942 Damon Runyon tale in which Ball's  ill-fated, flashy, gold-digging Manhattan singer is adored by Henry Fonda's  naive busboy. This is the "Midnight Cowboy" of a more innocent era. (1:55)  </P> <P> Sounder (Channel 7 Sunday at 1 p.m.): Martin Ritt's stirring 1972 film stars  Cicely Tyson and Paul Winfield as a resilient backwoods Louisiana couple  struggling to raise a family as sharecroppers in the depths of the Depression.  (2:00)  </P> <P> Go Tell the Spartans (Channel 11 Friday at 2:30 a.m.): An unjustly neglected,  terse, acrid account of our early involvement in Vietnam, directed by Ted Post  and starring Burt Lancaster as a crusty, lusty combat veteran in one of the  best performances of his career.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> CHUMASH INDIANS URGE NAME FOR PARK  </P> <P> A group of Chumash Indians meeting Sunday night voted to recommend that a  proposed new wilderness area in north Ventura County be named the Chumash  Wilderness Area.  </P> <P> Patrick Tumamait, who organized the meeting, attended by about 40 people, said  he prefers the name Chumash over other suggestions because it would increase  the tribe's visibility.  </P> <P> The meeting, held at the Washington School auditorium in Ventura, was called to  recommend a Chumash name for the wilderness, which includes a number of sites  with historical or spiritual significance to the tribe.  </P> <P> Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) said last week that he would seek to get  the name chosen by the Chumash approved if the wilderness bill, now stalled in  the Senate, passes.  </P></p>

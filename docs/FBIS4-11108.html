			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Alfonso Malespin Jiron] </F>   [Text] In a news conference to announce that the government  has already signed the letter of intent for the ESAF [Enhanced  Structural Adjustment Facility] with the IMF, Presidency  Minister Antonio Lacayo explained that fuel prices and  electricity and water rates will increase continuously as the  cordoba slides against the dollar.    Diesel will increase 46 centavos between April and December,  at the rate of seven centavos a month; gasoline will increase 14  centavos each month; the minimum rate for electricity  consumption will increase from 51 to 55 cordobas; and the  minimum water consumption rate will increase from 16 to 17.07  cordobas.    In addition, the ESAF -- which will guarantee $660 million  in  funds and the renegotiation of the $11.638 billion foreign debt  -- will not help the current agricultural season, because the  funds will not begin arriving in the country until July.    The coffee and cattle sectors and the FISE [Emergency Fund  For Social Investments] and PAMIC [National Program to Support  Microenterprises] projects will benefit from funds from the  Inter-American Development Bank, IDB, and the BCIE [Central  American Bank of Economic Integration].    According to Lacayo, with the ESAF, the government is  "righting the wrongs" it inherited from former President Ortega  and recovering "the sovereignty lost" by contracting a debt  which he estimated at $12 billion.    The members of the economic cabinet were especially harsh in  their references to the Sandinist Front, which they accused of  "mortgaging" and "harming the sovereignty" of the country during  the past decade. According to them, it is not until now that  the economic policy is being handled responsibly. It was  announced that "the government is not going to pay the military  debt [deuda belica]" left by the past administration. According  to Foreign Minister Erwin Kruger, Nicaragua owes $3 billion to  the former Soviet Union. Russia demands the payment of at least  $500 million, but the Violeta Chamorro government is willing to  renegotiate only $150 million.    According to Finance Minister Emilio Pereira, the ESAF "will  open opportunities for everyone, specially the poorest people,"  because it will reduce public expenses by 250 million cordobas  and strengthen the social protection umbrella. Minister Lacayo  stressed the ESAF does not represent new "rough times" for the  country, but an opportunity to pay less to the Paris Club;  greater financing for agricultural production; and more schools  and health centers. "This is a fundamental phase to place the  house in order; it is directed at resolving debt problems,"  Finance Minister Emilio Pereira said. "The new phase is one of  opportunities and of an economy for progress." Minister Lacayo  said that even though the ESAF will mean that the country will  have "the opportunity to grow in a sustained and equitable  manner," the government is ready to face any protest by the  people.    In a positive tone, Minister Lacayo said that through the  ESAF, three jobs will be created for each one of the 13,500 jobs  that will be eliminated in the state sector in the next three  years, adding 84,675 jobs.

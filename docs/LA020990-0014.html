			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LOYOLA FACULTY OKS RECOGNITION OF GAY GROUP  </P> <P> The Faculty Senate of Loyola Marymount University narrowly voted by secret  ballot Thursday to recommend that University President James N. Loughran  officially recognize an organization for gay and lesbian students, which is  seeking formal club status at the Jesuit-operated Catholic campus.  </P> <P> By a 9-8 vote, the senate, an advisory group of 22 faculty members representing  each of the university's four colleges, voted to urge Loughran to recognize the  Alliance of Gays and Lesbians, a newly formed group that has been meeting  off-campus, said Linda Bannister, a member of the English department who  co-sponsored the resolution. Five members of the senate were absent.  </P> <P> Bannister and co-sponsor Jeffrey Siker, an assistant professor of theology,  argued that the club should be granted recognition "because it deals with the  issue of human rights and (the university's) commitment to free and open  exchange of ideas," Bannister said.  </P> <P> Siker called the discussion at the faculty meeting "congenial, even collegial.  . . . Some members were concerned of even appearing to be discriminating  against gay students at a liberal arts school."  </P> <P> However, Siker said, other faculty members argued that approving such a group  would go against the university's principles and philosophy as a Catholic  university.  </P> <P> A support group for gay law students, the Lesbian and Gay Student Union, was  formed in the mid-1970s at Loyola Law School. Donald P. Merrifield, then  university president, approved the group, saying it advocated human rights but  did not promote a gay life style.  </P> <P> Siker said some faculty members said it would not be fair to set a different  standard for the university's undergraduate students.  </P> <P> The group seeking recognition includes about a dozen students, who began  holding support meetings in the spring of 1989 in an off-campus apartment, said  senior James Munselle, who is president of the group.  </P> <P> Munselle has retained attorney Gloria Allred, who sent a letter to Loughran on  Wednesday urging him to recognize the group.  </P> <P> Campus policy for starting a new club requires the approval of the student  affairs committee, which voted 9 to 2 last December to grant the club formal  recognition. The group also has drafted a constitution, as required, which  describes its goals as providing support for gays and lesbians on campus,  promoting awareness and sensitivity to the gay community, and supporting human  rights.  </P> <P> Loyola Marymount's student senate voted 12 to 4 last week to approve a  resolution urging Loughran to approve the club.  </P> <P> The final decision, however, is up to Loughran. University spokeswoman Leah  Chester-Davis said Thursday that the president had yet to make a decision.  </P> <P> If the group is granted recognition, it would gain the right to hold meetings  on campus, to advertise events and speakers in the campus newsletter, and would  be eligible for funding through the controller's office, according to policies  outlined in the Loyola Marymount student handbook.  </P></p>

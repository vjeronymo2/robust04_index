			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Nigerian strike brings big oil price rise Oil prices yesterday rose above Dollars 19 a barrel for the first time in more than a year as markets reacted to fears of further production cuts in Nigeria. The decision by striking Nigerian oil unions to boycott planned talks yesterday with the military government triggered the latest price rises. The benchmark Brent Blend for September closed in London at Dollars 19.18 a barrel, its highest price for 15 months and 57 cents up on its Friday close. The two main Nigerian oil unions, Nupeng and Pergasson, are demanding the release from custody of Mr Moshood Abiola, the apparent winner of last year's presidential election, as a condition for returning to work. Mr Abiola is being tried for treason. The unions have also demanded an end to widespread corruption in the industry and improved conditions. Shell, the largest foreign oil company operating in Nigeria, accounted for about half of Nigeria's output of 1.95m barrels a day before the strike by petroleum workers began more than three weeks ago. Yesterday it said output at its fields was down by more than a third from normal levels. The biggest fall in production is thought to be at the onshore oil fields of Forcados and Bonny. Shell and the other western oil companies active in Nigeria are thought to be concentrating their efforts to maintain offshore production. Although Nigeria accounts for only 3 per cent of world oil production, about 1.6m barrels of its 1.95m barrels of normal daily output is exported, mainly to the US. Nigerian supply disruptions coincide with rising world demand for oil and high rates of capacity utilisation. Experts estimate there is only 2m-3m barrels a day of unused production capacity in the world. The possibility of a complete cut-off of Nigerian supplies from world markets is low, according to Mr Joe Stanislaw, of Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris. 'But the theoretical possibility of it happening is having a significant psychological effect on relatively firm oil markets.' Mr Peter Gignoux of US brokerage house Smith Barney, said the 'cohesive and aggressive behaviour' of the Nigerian unions had taken many international oil traders and companies by surprise.</p>

			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Business and the Environment: Roll your dice, save the planet - Victoria Griffith unwraps some ecological board games in the US After the presents and Christmas pudding, environmental concerns may be far from the thoughts of most holiday revellers - unless, of course, some well-meaning gift-giver has placed an ecological board game under the tree. In that case, the dilemmas of pollution may soon be bearing down over an after-dinner game. A simple roll of the dice in Pollution Solution, an ecological board game for adults, could land a player in a tough spot. 'Farmers use electricity from coal to run irrigation equipment,' reads one card ominously. The player has to guess the solution printed on the back, which suggests that farmers use windmill power instead. Dozens of ecological board games are appearing in US toy and hobby shops, and many are big sellers. Family Pastimes, a Canadian group which makes A Beautiful Place, says it can hardly keep up with orders. Other manufacturers include Aristoplay, Family Games and Ravensburg, a German-based group. The names of the games are certainly catchy - Colourful Kingdom, Feeding Frenzy, and Bottles &amp; Bins to name a few. Because the stated goal of the games is to teach children and adults about the environment  - while having fun, of course - the manufacturers have some clear messages to pass on. Most of the games assure consumers that recycled materials were used 'wherever possible'. Many of the games are 'co-operative', meaning no one can lose - or win, depending on how you look at it. 'When we recycle, everyone wins,' says the box of the recycling game Bottles &amp; Bins. A Beautiful Place is more sensational: 'Players work together, not against each other to restore beauty. Can they do it before the looming Dark Clouds surround our special Beautiful Place?' A Beautiful Place has players clear away a Gotham-like drawing of a city, piece by polluted piece. The players get points for good deeds, such as turning off electric lights, planting a tree, or using public transport. Feeding Frenzy tries to increase awareness about endangered sharks by turning the players into sharks. There is no doubt who's the bad guy. Players lose points based on scenarios such as: 'Humans hunt you for meat, shark fin soup, oil, leather, and sometimes just for sport,' or: 'Toxic Waste] Chemicals dumped by humans kill your prey.' Humans do have an occasional soft spot: 'Humans lure you close by throwing fresh meat overboard. You end up starring in a nature film. Congratulations] You win five points.' Some games may be guilty of over-simplifying environmental issues. Problem 26 of Pollution Solution, for instance, reads: 'Leaky faucets (taps) and running toilets waste energy.' The easy answer? 'Residents fix plumbing.' Or take Problem 12, which says: 'This section is overpopulated. Risks to environment and health.' Solution? 'Couples agree to have no more than two children.' Players may take exception to manufacturers' opinions. One five-year-old playing Colourful Kingdom, made by Family Games of Quebec, was disturbed at the classification of a penguin as a 'water animal'. It may be no coincidence that most of the games are aimed at youngsters. Children seem especially receptive to the games, maybe because they can blithely ignore the underlying political issues. After a lively game of Bottles &amp; Bins, in which children try to sort plastic bottles, food waste and other items into the appropriate recycling containers, I saw a group of children sit through a lecture on the difficulties of battery recycling only to return blissfully to their battery-operated toys. If the game doesn't make the point, you can always recycle the wrapping paper. A childrens' paper recycling kit is another best seller this Christmas.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Bourse watchdog fines Tapie Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial French politician and businessman, has been fined FFr1m (Pounds 110,000) by the Paris stock market authorities for disclosing inaccurate information about Testut, a company he chaired from 1987 to 1992. Mr Tapie was criticised for releasing information in 1990 which 'did not seem to be either accurate, precise or sincere'. The fine is the latest in a long line of brushes between Mr Tapie and the French financial establishment. It comes at a time when Mr Tapie, who was briefly minister of urban affairs in the last socialist cabinet, is leading the European election campaign for MRG, a group of left-wing parties dubbed Les Tapistes by the French press. So far Mr Tapie's political fortunes seem to have been helped rather than hindered by his scuffles with the authorities. MRG has recently risen rapidly in the opinion polls to reach around 10 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH PRICE OF MASTERING THE TICKET GAME  </P> <P> In Sylvie Drake Aug. 17 article on telephone ticket sales, "Why You Can't Order  Exact Seats by Phone," Ticketmaster chairman Fred Rosen seems worried that  transaction times would be prolonged if customers were allowed to learn exactly  what seats they were getting for their money.  </P> <P> Question: When Ticketmaster phone clerks stretch out transaction times by  trying to sell subscriptions to the Ticketmaster magazine, is that a good idea?  </P> <P> If you answered yes, congratulations, you're a Ticket Master; if no, well, bad  news -- you're a Ticket Slave, like me.  </P> <P> DANA ALAN LaFONTAINE  </P> <P> West Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Arts: The chamber opens - Wigmore Hall season Presumably the audience for chamber music just goes on holiday in the summer. While the Wigmore Hall is closed, no other venue in London tries to fill the gap and the opening of the new season on the first weekend of September is greeted with pent-up enthusiasm. Advance bookings are said to be healthy this year. A series of concerts marking the tercentenary of Purcell's death (not strictly due until 1995) is already heavily sold, suggesting that the Wigmore Hall might profit from scheduling more early music. On its traditional territory of song recitals it has again put together an impressive line-up of singers for its International Festival of Song, which starts the season. No favouritism was shown at the opening night. Four singers had been invited to share the platform on Saturday, which is a clever way of making sure that fewer important people feel slighted. Barbara Bonney, Anne Sofie von Otter, Kurt Streit and Olaf Bar together for a light-hearted programme of vocal quartets by Brahms and Schumann, including - inevitably - both sets of Brahms's evergreen Liebeslieder-Walzer. The singers came down from the Edinburgh Festival, where they had performed the same programme as a late-night recital, which was recorded live by EMI. Why the record company should choose the Usher Hall for its recording is a mystery. The Wigmore offers a far more appropriate ambience for intimate music like these drawing-room quartets and there was nothing but delight to be had from hearing them there, sung by four such high-quality voices. The quartet was perfectly balanced and admirably accompanied by Helmut Deutsch and Bengt Forsberg. Bonney's tender cradling of the soprano solos was particularly lovely. It was a shame that the warm glow they left was so quickly doused with cold water the following night. Christiane Oelze and Hans Peter Blochwitz performed a substantial selection of songs from Wolf's Spanisches Liederbuch and promptly disproved a theory gaining credence of late, namely that a good voice and a native command of German are sufficient to guarantee a Lieder singer who is worth hearing. Oelze and Blochwitz both have fine voices and both are German, but their Wolf was as bland as could be. Barely any song managed to pin down its central emotion with real decisiveness, though when Oelze did start to lead the way and get a grip on the more extrovert songs, the pianist Eric Schneider usually followed in sympathy. In this set of songs Wolf shows a remarkably sharp ability to probe pain and anguish, of which these two singers seemed blissfully unaware. After 90 minutes of nice singing one came away feeling thoroughly anaesthetised.</p>

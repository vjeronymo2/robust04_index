			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEADERS FALL TO JONES AT VENTURA  </P> <P> P. J. Jones of Rolling Hills drove to a 50-lap main-event victory in the U. S.  Auto Club's National Midget race at Ventura Raceway on Saturday night on a  wind-swept, super-slick quarter-mile dirt oval that produced numerous  spin-outs.  </P> <P> A field that included more than 70 cars also slowed the action as the program  fell more than 90 minutes behind schedule.  </P> <P> Jones, who finished seventh in the USAC Western States Series points standings,  held off Jeff Gordon of Pittsboro, Ind., and Mike Streicher of Findlay, Ohio.  </P> <P> Gordon and Streicher finished second and third, respectively, although Gordon  continues to lead the national points standings over Streicher, 463-451, with  three races remaining.  </P> <P> Gordon went wire to wire to win a 10-lap semi-main event and qualify for the  feature.  </P> <P> Still to be determined at press time was Jay Drake's bid to seal the Western  States Series three-quarter Midget championship. Drake holds a 52-point lead  over Cory Kruseman of Ventura. PAUL OLSON  </P></p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Demjanjuk acquitted ISRAEL'S Supreme Court yesterday acquitted John Demjanjuk of being the sadistic 'Ivan the Terrible' who operated gas chambers at the Nazi Treblinka concentration camp in the second world war, writes David Horovitz in Jerusalem. Documentation from other Treblinka guards obtained after Mr Demjanjuk was convicted and sentenced to death in 1988 cast 'reasonable doubt' on the evidence identifying him as Ivan, the five Israeli judges concluded unanimously. The former Treblinka guards identified Ivan the Terrible as Ivan Marchenko, an older, darker man than Mr Demjanjuk. The court was persuaded, however, that the Ukrainian-born Mr Demjanjuk, extradited from the US in 1986, had been an SS guard at Sobibor and other concentration camps but chose not to convict him since they were not included in the original indictment and since he had not been given adequate opportunity to defend himself. Mr Demjanjuk heard the ruling without obvious emotion. His son, John Jnr, by contrast, pronounced himself 'absolutely delighted' and said he would ask the US authorities to allow his stateless father to return to the family home in Cleveland, Ohio. Treblinka survivor Mr Josef Czarny, who testified against Mr Demjanjuk at the original trial, said after the ruling that he was still convinced Mr Demjanjuk was 'the arch murderer of Treblinka' and that the acquittal was 'a terrible mistake.' The case is bound to have implications for other war crimes investigations because of the doubts it casts on reliability of eye-witness evidence 50 years after the second world war.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] After his meeting with the president today, the  former Minister of Finance [Boris Fedorov] gave a special  interview for Ostankino's "Novosti" program:    [Begin Fedorov recording] First, I did not submit my  resignation. I simply did not accept the invitation to join the  reorganized Cabinet. I did not submit a resignation, but I  refused to accept the invitation. The president repeated his  offer to me once again. I cited the same arguments, saying that  when policies are being changed, policies which were repeatedly  spelled out in government documents...[pauses] We were aiming  for 60-80 percent annual inflation at the end of the year. But  now they are proposing 300 percent. This is a change of policy.  So, I cannot participate in this.    If people who are manifestly opposed to the government,  opposed to the policy which we pursued in 1993 -- a policy which  produced substantial results -- are brought into the government,  this is the premier's and the president's prerogative. But they  tell me that there is no reason to remove Gerashchenko, for  instance. This means that he is right and I am wrong. So, my  choice is a very simple one.    I respect the premier's choice in forming the government. He  is entitled to choose the government he wants. But, as a free  man, I am also entitled to determine my own place in this  structure.

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / UK Company News: BAT commits Dollars 40m to Volga factory BAT Industries, the Anglo-American tobacco and insurance company, is taking another step into the former Soviet Union with a Dollars 40m (Pounds 27m) investment in a Russian cigarette factory. BAT is buying about 75 per cent of the shares in the Saratov Tobacco Factory, which is situated on the Volga, about 700km south-east of Moscow. The announcement came only days after the group agreed to invest Dollars 200m in return for a majority stake in the tobacco industry of the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan. In both cases BAT said its priority was to increase the quantity and quality of the cigarettes produced. The Saratov factory currently makes approximately 5bn cigarettes a year, a total which BAT plans to increase to 10bn over three years. The company is committed to investing a total of Dollars 40m, including the purchase price, over the period. Mr Ulrich Herter, managing director of BAT's tobacco businesses, said: 'This is an important first step in our investment plans for Russia. We have been very impressed with the management team at Saratov, who have negotiated with a real sense of purpose and commitment, enabling us to make rapid progress. 'This augurs well for our future co-operation.' BAT is also in advanced negotiations with the Java Factory in Moscow, which currently makes about 14bn cigarettes a year. The two factories together would have potential capacity of 30bn cigarettes a year, compared with a total Russian market of some 250bn.</p>

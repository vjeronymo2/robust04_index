			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Unipart takes strategic steps in manufacturing expansion Unipart, the motor components and accessories group, will launch on Thursday a further expansion of its exhaust and catalytic converter manufacturing operations. The move comes just six days after Unipart paid Pounds 21.6m for Ketlon, the motor components subsidiary of former commodities and property group, Berisford International. The acquisition and expansion - at Unipart's Premier Exhausts subsidiary at Coventry - were described by Mr John Neill, Unipart's group chief executive, as ' further strategic steps in the development of our manufacturing business.' Ketlon is to become part of Unipart Industries, the manufacturing division which has become the main focus of the group's expansion and which has acquired substantial business with Toyota's and Honda's UK car manufacturing operations. Ketlon, which employs 400 at Paddock Wood in Kent, makes transmission parts for several vehicle makers, including Ford, General Motors, Honda, Jaguar and Rover. It will substantially expand Unipart's machining process capability into a broader spread of motor components business. Specifically, it will complement Advanced Engineering Systems, a Tipton, Staffordshire-based subsidiary which already makes machined castings.</p>

			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (UK Equities - Winners and Losers): Table-topper counts the costs As usual, the winners and losers among smaller companies are a disparate bunch, writes David Wighton. Top of the table in the index is Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, a company that has hardly covered itself in glory lately. Having bid too much to retain its ITV licence, Yorkshire's previous management got itself into a terrible tangle by over-selling its advertising slots. The new team has cut costs ruthlessly, but the share price reflects hopes that the government will relax the rules that prevent Yorkshire being acquired by another ITV company. Shares in Greggs rose nicely after its June acquisition of the Baker's Oven business owned by Associated British Foods; this almost doubled its size and made it the UK's biggest retail baker. The revival of Michael Page's fortunes was perhaps more predictable given that its executive recruitment business is geared highly to economic cycles. A sharp recovery in activity in the middle management market drove the company's profits up strongly. Goode Durrant, a conglomerate which has been focusing on its commercial vehicle and equipment hire businesses, also saw business pick up. Macallan-Glenlivet had less help from its markets, with sluggish growth in whisky sales. But thanks to the continued success of The Macallan malt, the company increased first half-profits by almost a fifth. There were even more spectacular gains among the smallest companies. The all-comers title goes to UAPT-Infolink, a UK credit reference company. Its shares rose by more than 800 per cent thanks to a bidding auction which eventually saw it acquired by Equifax, a US credit data group. The runner-up was Hawtal Whiting, an automotive design consultant, with a rise of more than 400 per cent. It was followed by Ransomes, which makes mowers, with an increase of nearly 370 per cent. Among the laggards, the best-known name is Wembley, the heavily-indebted stadium and greyhound track operator; its shareholders now are paying for its ill-judged acquisition spree in the late 1980s. The problems of Brown &amp; Jackson also hit the headlines with the Poundstretcher discount store chain's financial problems ending in a rescue by South Africa's Pepkor. Shares in Merrydown fell flat when the cider-maker revealed its premium brands were losing market share to cheaper rivals. Intercare saw its profits fall by more than half, due partly to disappointing returns from ventures in new medical products. Not quite in the dunce's half dozen, but nearly, were GBE and Trio. GBE International, the engineering group once known as Downiebrae, fell into loss in the first half of the year while Trio, the money and securities broker, saw profits halve as market activity slumped. But investors in all these laggards can count themselves lucky compared with Colorgen, a US-based manufacturer of colour-matching equipment with shares traded on the USM. The company's bank called in its loan in July, and the business had to be sold at a knock-down price. Shareholders were left with nothing.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE WINNERS AND LOSERS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    value at    value at    per cent TOP 100                        31/12/93 (p)    22/12/94      change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WINNERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- British Steel                         126         157         24.60 British Petroleum                     360.5       432         19.83 SmithKline B Units                    365         343         18.90 Asda                                   55.5        65.5       18.02 Tesco                                 213.5       244         14.29 Eastern Group                         675         771         14.22  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LOSERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Kingfisher                            774         433        -44.06 Caradon                               414         259        -37.44 MEPC                                  542         388        -28.41 General Accident                      716         515        -28.07 Cable &amp;

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, Jan 23 (CTK) -- Slovak Foreign Minister  Jozef Moravcik said today that the question of European security  could not be solved without Russia's participation. Speaking in  a Slovak Television discussion program "Kroky" (Steps), Moravcik  said that there was no reason for Russia to feel threatened by a  possible eastwards expansion of NATO. He said the apprehension  could be removed by the signature of a package of agreements  between Russia and Nato.    Russian Ambassador to Slovakia Sergey Yastrzhembskiy said  that the Partnership for Peace plan had dispelled Russia's fears  of a new power division of Europe. He said that a large portion  of the Russian society, brought up in the totalitarian faith  that the NATO countries were its major enemies, disagreed with  the pact's expansion. To overlook this would strengthen the  positions of Russian ultra-nationalist forces, Yastrzhembskiy  stressed. If this situation is to be coped with, no "overhasty"  expansion of the pact must be allowed, Russia must be given an  active role in the implementation of the partnership, a treaty  between the alliance and Moscow could be signed.    U.S. Ambassador to Slovakia Theodore Russell said that  Moscow's fears could be best dispelled if Russia joined the  Partnership for Peace.    Slovak Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak said Slovakia was  intensively drafting a law providing for civil control of the  Armed Forces, one of the conditions of the partnership. Under  the law, two thirds of the Defense Ministry's staff are to be  civilians. Russell praised the Slovak approach to the plan.    Moravcik confirmed once again that Slovakia's goal was  fully-fledged membership of NATO, adding that the Partnership  for Peace was the "entrance gate" to it.</p>

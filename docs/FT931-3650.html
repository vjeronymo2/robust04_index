			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Industrial chiefs lead skills drive A BUSINESS-LED advisory council to bring fresh impetus to transforming the skills of the workforce and to speed up the introduction of National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs), will be announced by the government today. The National Advisory Council for Education and Training Targets (Nacett) will be chaired by Mr Peter Davis, deputy chairman and chief executive of Reed Elsevier, the magazine publisher. Other members include Mr Dominic Cadbury, chief executive of Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionery and soft drinks manufacturer, and Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU engineering and electrical union. Five years ago the government authorised NVQs to help improve Britain's poor skills record, but implementation has been slow. Based on an individual's ability to do a task, NVQs stretch from level one (semi-skilled) to level five (higher professional), and provide comparability between different occupations and between vocational and academic qualifications. The Confederation of British Industry last year led an initiative to set national targets for take-up of NVQs. By 1997 80 per cent of young people should have achieved NVQ2 or its academic equivalent. The figure now is about 50 per cent. The government endorses these targets but has fought shy of giving them full backing. The establishment of Nacett, with a parallel body in Scotland, indicates that it is becoming more involved. Most employers pay only lip service to NVQs. Reasons for this include: The Department of Employment has done little promotion. Many employers have feared that the government would abandon the reform. NVQs can be expensive, with accreditation fees in addition to extra training costs. To introduce them for the 30,000 weekly paid staff of J. Sainsbury, the retailer, would cost Pounds 3.2m on certification alone. Some employers argue that NVQs are too broad, others that they are too narrow. Critics say standards will vary because assessment is done in-house. Some employers fear that workers might demand more pay for attaining NVQs. Acquisition of the new Investors in People quality standard for in-company training and development is not dependent on a company training to NVQ standards. Nacett will monitor progress towards the targets, publish an annual report, and advise the government. The council will report to the secretaries of state for education, employment, and Wales. It replaces the National Training Task Force, which was also made up of business leaders.</p>

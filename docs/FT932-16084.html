			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / International Company News: GM names new head of worldwide purchasing GENERAL Motors has unexpectedly named Mr Richard Wagoner, its young chief financial officer, to replace Mr J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who quit as head of worldwide purchasing last month and controversially joined Volkswagen in Germany. Mr Wagoner, 40, who was only named chief financial officer last November, will continue to hold that position as well as taking on Mr Lopez's responsibilities. The move surprised some analysts, who questioned whether Mr Wagoner would be able to devote sufficient time to the purchasing job while wearing two hats, and noted that he had spent much of his career on the financial side of GM, rather than in manufacturing. Reform of the purchasing system - including pressuring suppliers to cut prices - forms a crucial part of GM's drive to turn its loss-making North American car operations back to profit. Mr Lopez is believed to have saved GM more than Dollars 1bn in costs during his 10 months in the job. An important element of his success was his obsessive, idiosyncratic and energetic nature. Mr Jack Smith, GM chief executive, said yesterday daily staff operations of the finance group would be overseen by Mr Leon Krain, a corporate vice-president, allowing Mr Wagoner to focus immediately on his purchasing responsibilities. Mr Smith reiterated that the success of the purchasing initiative was vital to GM's competitiveness and said Mr Wagoner brought to the task knowledge of both operations and finance, as well as 'creativity, drive and leadership'.</p>

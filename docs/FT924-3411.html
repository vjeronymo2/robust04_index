			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Opposition grows to Sugar's plans AMSTRAD'S share price fell 4p to 24p yesterday amid further signs that Mr Alan Sugar's 30p-a-share buy-back proposals for the consumer electronics group faces strong opposition from individual and institutional shareholders. With today's 2.15pm deadline for the receipt of proxies for the company's extraordinary meeting nearing, two more large institutional investors said they had decided to vote against the proposals. Standard Life, which holds 13.5m Amstrad shares, equivalent to a 2.3 per cent equity stake, said it was joining other institutional investors led by Prudential and Postel in opposing the deal. Another institution said it had already voted against the proposals, but did not wish to be identified. Meanwhile Mr Sugar said late yesterday that he thought it was 'highly unlikely' that trend shown in proxies already received by the company would be reversed before the Court and extraordinary meetings called to vote on the buy-back plan in London on Thursday afternoon. He said that 'quite a few more' proxy votes came in over the weekend, but that an unofficial count of the proxies received by Saturday night showed the same trend as those received by the close of business last Thursday when almost 60 per cent were against his proposed 'scheme of arrangement'. Mr Sugar, who has a personal 35 per cent equity stake in Amstrad, has warned that the share price may fall sharply if his bid to take Amstrad private again is defeated. Commenting on the share price fall yesterday he said it appeared some investors had already decided to 'dump' their Amstrad stock. With about 1.5m shares changing hands the stock fell as low as 22 1/2 p before recovering some of its losses. Although proxies for Amstrad's EGM are due in today, proxies for the court meeting which preceeds the EGM on Thursday and must also approve the scheme, can be submitted up until the meeting itself.</p>

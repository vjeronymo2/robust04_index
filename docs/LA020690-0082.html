			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1991 MAY SEE 30-CENT 1ST-CLASS STAMP  </P> <P> The U.S. Postal Service will file March 6 for an approximately 20% increase in  postal rates, which will translate into a 30-cent first-class stamp in early  1991, Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank said Monday.  </P> <P> Frank said last year that first-class postage would rise in 1991 to at least 28  cents and perhaps as high as 32 cents.  </P> <P> The Postal Service is expected to suffer its worst deficit ever this year, more  than $1.5 billion.  </P> <P> The soon-to-be proposed increase will affect all postal rates, a Postal Service  spokeswoman said Monday. The independent Postal Rate Commission will review the  request and can modify it, Frank said.  </P> <P> The increase is needed because of higher expenses, particularly labor and fuel  costs, Frank said at a news conference Monday in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The last rate hike came in April, 1988, when the price of a first-class stamp  jumped to 25 cents from 22 cents. Frank acknowledged that the increase will be  higher than the rate of inflation over the three-year period.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOODWILL GAMES;  </P> <P> FOUR POSITIVE DRUG TESTS FOUND  </P> <P> Four of 493 drug tests at the Goodwill Games were positive, two for  over-the-counter drugs and two for unspecified substances, officials said  Sunday.  </P> <P> Of the 587 tests scheduled to be conducted, 493 from 18 sports had been  analyzed through Saturday, said Baaron Pittenger, co-chairman of the  Soviet-American Joint Commission Against Doping in Sport.  </P> <P> But Pittenger declined to elaborate.  </P> <P> "We told the national governing bodies that there would be no announcement on  results," Pittenger said. "But we felt the aggregate results were so pleasing  that we made this announcement."  </P> <P> The drug testing was conducted by the U.S. Olympic Committee after Turner  Broadcasting, which sponsored the games, refused to handle the procedures. It  cost the USOC about $200,000.  </P> <P> "From my experience," said Don Catlin, head of the IOC-accredited laboratory at  UCLA, which analyzed the tests, "the lab results show a significant decline in  the use of various banned drugs from what we have seen previously."  </P></p>

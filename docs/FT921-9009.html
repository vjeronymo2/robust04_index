			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Study shows tolerance of dividend cuts MOST INSTITUTIONAL inv-estors will tolerate cuts in corporate dividends in instances where the entire sector is under pressure, although such cuts could jeopardise their long-term relationship with the company, a new study shows. Warwick Corporate, an investor relations firm, has surveyed 12 of the UK's largest fund managers - with a total of Pounds 250bn under management - about their views towards corporate dividends. Of the 12 surveyed, 10 said that cutting a dividend was not automatic grounds for selling a company's shares. However, when the company returned to the market to seek cash from its shareholders, the surveyed said it would take them a long time to forget that it had happened. The maintenance of dividend payments in the face of the current recession has proved a contentious issue for institutions. Last year, Mr Paddy Linaker, M&amp;G Group's chief executive, provoked a storm by writing to the heads of some of the UK's largest companies urging them to maintain dividends despite the recession. Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England, responded that cutting dividends under adverse trading conditions was a sign of strength. Warwick's survey showed that while further dividend cuts are expected in 1992, they are likely to occur among smaller companies so that the overall effect on yields will be small. Most fund managers surveyed believe that dividend cuts are already factored into share prices and that most fund managers have sufficient cash flow to ride out any reductions in dividends. Overall, institutions expect the dividend cuts to be concentrated in the contracting and construction, composite insurance, engineering, building materials and metals industries. Those regarded as least likely to cut dividends are companies in the health and household sectors, utilities, food retailers and manufacturers, and telecommunications industries.</p>

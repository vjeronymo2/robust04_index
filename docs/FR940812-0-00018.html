			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No Federal funds for this program shall be granted to an applicant who has an outstanding delinquent Federal debt until the delinquent account has been paid in full, nor shall funds be granted to an applicant for which an outstanding judgment obtained by the United States in a Federal Court (other than in the United States Tax Court), which has been recorded, unless it has been paid in full or otherwise satisfied, as required by the Federal Debt Collection Act of 1990.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 310B(d)(2) further prohibits financial assistance over $1 million, or where direct employment is increased by more than 50 employees, if: (1) it is likely to result in the transfer from one area to another any employment or business activity, unless it expands existing businesses or establishes a new location or; (2) it will increase the production or the availability of services or facilities in an area which will increase employment and have an adverse effect on existing competitors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Application Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications to be submitted must include a clear statement of the goal(s) and objective(s) of the project and a plan which describes the proposed project as required by the CONACT, Sec. 310B (f)(2). Such plan must contain specific elements to be addressed which have been deemed necessary to carry out the intent of the program and will also serve as the basis for the selection criteria that will be used to evaluate the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The program objectives and eligible grant purposes based on the statute are set forth in the interim rule. The Agency has expanded these eligible purposes to include equipment and materials necessary to carry out the objectives of the plan. This purpose is incidental and required to carry out the program's statutory objectives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ineligible grant purposes identified in the interim rule are in accordance with 7 CFR 3015 and 3016 and are consistent with other RDA grant programs. In addition, RTDG funds may not be provided to support greater than 75 percent of eligible project costs or to pay for building construction, the purchase of real estate or vehicles, improving and/or renovation of office space, or repair or maintenance of privately-owned property. Due to the limited funding available, these limitations are necessary to benefit as many eligible projects as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Application requirements include submission of an SF&hyph;424, ``Application for Federal Assistance,'' and other supporting documentation. The information required is consistent with RDA's other grant programs. The application process for RTDG funds is a two-stage process. Preapplications are submitted to determine applicant eligibility. Upon an eligibility determination, applications are submitted to process for competitive project selection. All supporting documentation required in connection with the preapplication/application are necessary for RDA to determine if the applicant is eligible, if the proposed grant purposes are eligible, and to help the Agency select the best grant applications for funding. RDA is simultaneously publishing in this issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a Notice (inviting applications) that contains more specific guidance on submission of applications for FY 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Project Selection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 310B(f)(3) of the CONACT limits the Agency's discretion in selecting eligible projects for funding. Grants shall be made on a competitive basis. Preferences will be given to support projects that most effectively improve business, industry, and employment in rural areas. Emphasis for project selection will be given to those projects that ``*&blank;*&blank;* contribute the most to the improvement of economic conditions of rural areas. *&blank;*&blank;*'' The Agency has interpreted this statutory phrase to establish preferences for projects that will create industries or agribusinesses, increase employment, stem the flow of outmigration, and increase the tax base in the areas to be served. The applicant must provide data to support these criteria for the most current full calendar year for which data is available and the 3 prior calendar years. This range of information should provide an accurate picture of the economic conditions of the rural areas to be served. The Agency is placing an emphasis on these criteria based on the purposes and objectives set forth in the statute. The actual number of proposals to receive funding will depend on the total number of applications received and the amount of grant funds requested. Projects will be selected based on a priority point system set out in the regulation. The point system emphasizes those factors given preference by statute. Points will be totalled and ranked with other applications. This selection method has been successful in other grant programs administered by the Agency and is considered the best method to use for this program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RDA monitors and evaluates each project it approves in accordance with 7 CFR 3015 and 3016. Monitoring typically involves site visits by RDA staff and designated evaluators, telephone conversations, and evaluation of the grantee's written activity reports. Activity reports are used to evaluate projects and must be in a measurable form. Termination of grant provisions are in accordance with 7 CFR 3015 and 3016. These provisions are consistent with other RDA grant programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Miscellaneous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Recipients and subrecipients are subject to all applicable Federal laws, Federal and USDA policies, regulations, and procedures applicable to Federal financial assistance. Requirements concerning civil rights, the environment, debarment and suspension, etc., have been listed in this rule. These restrictions are consistent with other RDA grant programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7 CFR Part 1901  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Agriculture, Authority delegations, Civil rights, Compliance reviews, Fair housing, Minority groups.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

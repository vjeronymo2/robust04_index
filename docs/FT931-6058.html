			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Observer: Return business Now that Sir Phil Harris doesn't have to worry any more about chairing his beloved Guy's hospital, he can get back to the serious business of making money on his return to the stock market. This will please those who enjoyed observing, if not participating in, the progress of Harris Queensway up to its Pounds 450m leveraged takeover in 1988. His absence from the market has made it a duller place. His old company survived only two years after Sir Phil sold out at a Pounds 70m profit, showing just what a canny salesman he is. Sir Phil insists the business would not have gone under if he had remained in charge. Ever positive, the 50-year-old is bursting with enthusiasm about Carpetright, the chain he plans to float this summer. Some things will be different though. He promises no takeovers, and he says people 'will be surprised by the cleanness of the accounts'.</p>

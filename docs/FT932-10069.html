			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Arts: Today's Television Last week in the major New York auctions the late Andy Warhol's art was quite out of favour - which gives added poignancy to the Late Show Special The War Over Warhol. This delves into the controversy over the Warhol Foundation, which was intended to immortalise the artist and his works, and to do good, too. As usual there are disputes over Warhol's will, the Trustees, over everything, and so far the only beneficiaries are the lawyers. (BBC 2 at 11.15). Forty Minutes (BBC 2 at 9.50) has a knack of spotting off-beat stories. In 'Three Big Men' it follows the fortunes of the three strong British sumo wrestling team in Japan. At the national trials in London there were just three entrants so the team really picked itself. Their experiences among the big men in Tokyo makes rivetting viewing. The controversial Camille Paglia, the scourge of the feminists, is let loose on the Lolita syndrome in Without Walls (9 pm on Channel 4). Also in the usual double bill is Paul Eddy, a Provencal resident, who gives a very different view of his adopted village to that propagated by neighbour Peter Mayle.</p>

			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL OKS AIRPORT NOISE EXEMPTION  </P> <P> In response to a dispute at Van Nuys Airport, the Assembly Transportation  Committee on Monday approved by a vote of 15 to 0 a bill that would exempt  medical emergency flights from local airport anti-noise restrictions.  </P> <P> The measure, by Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge), would lift  regulations limiting the time of such flights, the type of airplanes flown and  the amount of noise they generate on departure.  </P> <P> It was sent to the full Assembly for consideration.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, local ordinances would not apply if an undue delay in an  emergency flight "would jeopardize a patient's medical condition," according to  the committee's analysis of the legislation.  </P> <P> La Follette introduced the measure after neighborhood groups protesting  airplane noise at Van Nuys Airport argued that charter companies who make the  emergency flights, including trips for organ transplants, should fall under  regulations that would require them to use quieter jets.  </P> <P> The medical flights currently are exempt from regulation by the city of Los  Angeles and the city Department of Airports, which restrict night takeoffs.  </P> <P> Opponents of such restrictions complained that the quieter jets could be  slower, resulting in delays in transporting organs for transplant operations.  </P></p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Labour to call four by-elections Labour business managers confirmed yesterday that they would call four by-elections for June 9, the same day as the European elections and the poll in Eastleigh, Hampshire, James Blitz writes. The party moved the writ to hold by-elections in three east London constituencies - Barking, Dagenham and Newham North East - and in Bradford South, West Yorkshire. At the last election, Labour had a comfortable majority in all four constituencies. The elections in Barking, Newham and Bradford were caused by the deaths of sitting MPs - Jo Richardson, Ron Leighton and Bob Cryer. The Dagenham election was caused by the resignation of Mr Bryan Gould, the former shadow cabinet member, on Monday. He had announced earlier he was taking an academic post in New Zealand.</p>

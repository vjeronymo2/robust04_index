			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 5-A BOYS;  </P> <P> IRVINE PUTS FINISHING TOUCHES ON TOP-SEEDED PASADENA, 67-60  </P> <P> Steve Dunmeyer got defensive, John Molle made the big shot and Bryan Allred  took control down the stretch Saturday night. All of which added up to an  Irvine High School upset that put Coach Steve Keith in another Southern Section  boys' championship basketball game.  </P> <P> Keith, who led Glendale to two titles before moving to Irvine last season, has  masterminded another trip to the finals. Irvine defeated top-seeded Pasadena,  67-60, in the 5-A semifinals before a capacity crowd of 1,800 at Christ College  in Irvine.  </P> <P> Irvine (24-5) will meet league rival Capistrano Valley (23-4) in the  championship game at 6:15 p.m. Saturday in the Los Angeles Sports Arena.  Capistrano Valley defeated Irvine twice in league play, but Keith isn't  discounting his chances in the third meeting.  </P> <P> "If you're good enough to get there (championship game), you're good enough to  win," Keith said. "You're so damn happy to be there, you don't care if it's the  Lakers you're playing."  </P> <P> Irvine qualified for its first title appearance by making 10 of 13 free throws  in the final quarter and getting a critical jump shot from Molle with the game  on the line. Molle, a sophomore, hit a 12-footer with 1:06 remaining to push  Irvine ahead, 62-58.  </P> <P> Irvine claimed the upset by making six free throws in the final 38 seconds,  ending Pasadena's 15-game winning streak in the process.  </P> <P> Pasadena (23-3) had won 19 games by 10 or more points, but the Bulldogs wilted  down the stretch with Dunmeyer dogging guard Idris Jones. Jones led Pasadena  with 18 points, but he failed to make a field goal in the last quarter as  Pasadena made only two of 10 shots.  </P> <P> The final quarter belonged to Allred, Irvine's often overlooked but seldom  outplayed guard. Allred scored nine of his game-high 22 points in the last  quarter and had four three-point shots in the game.  </P> <P> "He took charge in the fourth quarter. . . . He wanted the ball," Keith said.  "You really can't focus on one play in this game, but that shot by John Molle  was a big play."  </P> <P> Allred made eight of 13 shots, sometimes driving the lane for high-percentage  shots or dishing off to a teammate. Long-range shooting or penetration was his  game. Afterward, Allred said he looked forward to the challenge of facing  Capistrano Valley again.  </P> <P> "I'm excited," he said. "If I could pick anybody to play for the championship,  it would be Capistrano Valley. I knew all along we were a good team, so no, I'm  not surprised we're in the final."  </P> <P> For Pasadena Coach Bill Duwe, it marked the 10th time he has lost to a team  coached by Keith in 11 games going back to Keith's days at Glendale High.  </P> <P> "Give Irvine the credit, they outplayed us," Duwe said. "They shot the lights  out. I thought the two quick fouls that Don Mitchell got in the first quarter  really hurt us. Fouls took us out of the ballgame."  </P> <P> Mitchell, who has averaged 18 points in the playoffs, scored only three points  before fouling out midway through the fourth quarter. Pasadena made 25 of 49  shots, but Irvine was better, hitting 22 of 42 field goal attempts.  </P> <P> Reserve Tom Bulone played a big supporting role for Irvine. Bulone scored seven  points, including two free throws with 4:13 remaining that gave Irvine a 56-50  lead.  </P> <P> "Tom has been a big plus in the past three or four games coming off the bench,"  Keith said. "When games have been close, we've been real good at making the big  plays all year. Pasadena hasn't been in many close games this season, and that  was to our advantage."  </P></p>

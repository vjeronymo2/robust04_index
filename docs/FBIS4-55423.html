			<p>BFN     [Text] After returning from Moscow, members of the  delegation of the Serbian Civic Council of Bosnia-Herzegovina  held a news conference in Ljubljana today. Here is a report by  Mahmut Lakicevic:    [Begin Lakicevic recording] The Serbian Civic Council of  Bosnia-Herzegovina represents that force and initiative of the  Serbian people that categorically opposes the criminal and  aggressive policy of the Serbian Democratic Party and Karadzic's  Army and strives for the preservation of Bosnia-Herzegovina as  indivisible, sovereign, and recognized within its  natural-historical borders, as well as returning of the Serbian  people to its constitutive role together with the other two  ethnic groups in Bosnia-Herzegovina by strictly implementing  international political solutions -- of course, those that do  not recognize the aggressor's occupation and his (?methods) of  solving the Bosnian crisis.    This was the gist of the statements Mirko Pejanovic and Miro  Lazovic, members of the Serbian Civic Council, made at the news  conference in Ljubljana after their official visit to Moscow.  The (?continuation) of the peace process and the implementation  of the Washington agreement provide an opportunity for that  segment of the Serbian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina who do not  recognize Radovan Karadzic's (?aggressor's) regime and the idea  of a greater Serbia to join in the creation of the joint state  of the three peoples in which human, civil, and national rights  will be respected.    The aggressors' intention to create a greater Serbia through  coercion has undoubtedly caused the greatest harm and destroyed  many innocent lives above all among the Bosniak-Muslim people,  but Karadzic's war expeditions have also morally and spiritually  humiliated the Serb people in Bosnia-Herzegovina and set them  back 100 years in history.    The Serbian Civic Council of Bosnia-Herzegovina is trying to  present the real truth about the suffering of the people of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which differs from the aggressor's  propaganda and is rather successful in doing so. As Mirko  Pejanovic, member of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, put  it, the top Russian state leadership and church dignitaries with  whom the delegation met in Moscow recently, were astounded by  the fact that during the (?two-year) war in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  aggressor's guns destroyed about 700 mosques, desecrated  hundreds of Muslim and Croat tombs, and also ruined orthodox  churches. They could learn this only from the Serbs who  realistically saw into and [word indistinct] the entire outcome  of the Serbian attack on Bosnia and who want to regain lost  confidence and join the peaceful process of creating a united  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Lazovic pointed out that the Serbian Civic Council is more  and more recognized as a partner in negotiations, and has  already received invitations from many international  organizations and European countries to talks about including  into the Washington agreement those Serbs who consider  Bosnia-Herzegovina to be their homeland. This interest exists  in the guise of Bosnian Serbs in exile who are disappointed by  Milosevic's policy and consider themselves to be second-class  citizens, Pejanovic says, and they should be helped to return to  their homeland.    The Washington agreement and the creation of the  Bosniak-Croat Federation is the best opportunity for integrating  the third people deceived by the illusion and sick dream of a  greater Serbia whose builders and realizers should be brought  before justice and the war crimes tribunal.    Bosnia-Herzegovina must retain its multinational and  multicultural identity, as this is a condition of its historical  and national survival which is based solely upon peace, respect  for national rights, and the equality of its peoples, Mirko  Pejanovic concluded at today's news conference. Members of the  Serbian Civic Council were today received by Milan Kucan,  president of the Republic of Slovenia. The talks held touched  upon the role of the Bosnian Serbs in the Washington agreement  and international cooperation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and  Slovenia, as Miro Lazovic and Mirko Pejanovic are visiting that  country in the role of state officials. The current issue of  opening the embassy of the Republic of Slovenia in Sarajevo was  touched upon in particular, as there is a large number of  Slovenes who are still living on the territory controlled by the  Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and who want to take part in the  economic and cultural renewal of their second homeland.

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Forte These are busy times for Forte. While it tries to cement its deal with Ciga in Italy, wrangling over the chairmanship of the Savoy continues. Although it has just sold its stake in Kentucky Fried Chicken, a buyer is still being sought for the Harvester restaurant chain and its airport catering business is being prepared for flotation. For the longer term, the Ciga deal probably matters most, so it is disconcerting for Forte to see rivals such as Marriott also showing interest in this luxury hotel chain. By acquiring the Ciga brand, which is a strategic fit with its own luxury hotels, Forte would be making a leap forward in the top end of the market. Indeed, it would arguably be in the position to walk away from the Savoy, which remains as elusive a prey as ever. There is no sign of a negotiated agreement and the rolling 12-month notice which Forte must give of intention to bid is not much use when any such announcement would drive the Savoy share price higher. With Ciga in its portfolio, Forte might persuade the Savoy to negotiate. Otherwise it is hard to see how the process can be moved on. Forte remains unwilling to break its agreement not to buy more Savoy shares in the market, which would be expensive anyway at levels around Pounds 8. Faced with such prolonged uncertainty it might even decide it was not worth hanging on. As for the disposals, each one makes the risk of a rights issue more remote. Kentucky Fried Chicken is more sensitive to the cycle than Gardner Merchant and the airport catering business, but the disposals do lessen Forte's ability to offset the UK hotel cycle. The effect would be lessened by a greater presence in the the European luxury hotel market - which is where the Ciga deal comes in again.</p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Arts: Enter a man with a mission - Antony Thorncroft talks to Lord Gowrie, the new chairman of the beleaguered Arts Council The fifth floor suite at the Arts Council from which Lord Palumbo, as chairman, watched over four fat years of rising arts subsidy and one unhappy, final, year of strife and stringency, is empty. Gone is his exquisite collection of contemporary art; gone the hothouse flowers. The only decoration now is a photograph of Samuel Beckett propped up against the wall. 'Beckett is my hero', says the new chairman, Lord Gowrie. In a way, the empty room says it all. There is to be a fresh start; nothing can be taken for granted; the organisation's battered reputation, both with government and its arts clients, is going to be restored. Gowrie sees it as his mission to save the Arts Council. 'I think ministers would find life impossible without it,' he says. As a former arts minister, he should know. Lord Palumbo, a diffident, reserved man, was disillusioned in his final year of office by the fiasco over funding cuts for London orchestras and by the Treasury's decision to cut the council's grant by Pounds 3.2m. Lord Gowrie, 54, is a much tougher individual, more adept at traversing political and artistic minefields. A former chairman of Sotheby's, he is an arts junkie, a published poet, and a former art dealer. After Eton and Oxford (where he acquired his nickname, Grey, when his abundant hair prematurely acquired a silvery tinge) he lectured in the US and advised on art until a Conservative government desperate for young, energetic, supporters to do its business in the House of Lords, wooed him with the job of arts minister in 1983. He is married to the journalist Adelheid Grafin von der Schulenburg and, though his main home is in Wales, he continues to be a ubiquitous presence at London first nights. He lists book reviewing as his recreation in Who's Who and he is a collector with very much the same modern tastes as Lord Palumbo. This passion for modernism extends to all the arts. He was quick to stand up and applaud at Covent Garden's recent revival of Harrison Birtwistle's opera Gawain. In the current art world feud between 'brickies' and conservatives he is proud to be a bricky, though an admirer of minimalist Donald Judd rather than Tate bricklayer Carl Andre. And, of course, he is a fan of Samuel Beckett, the literary icon of minimalism. Gowrie's immediate objective is to persuade the government to restore the cut in subsidy, now around Pounds 5m in real terms. 'The base level of subsidy is too low. Just as it is hard for a pensioner to save a fiver so it is for arts companies that are already cut to the bone'. To achieve this change of heart he must first restore pride and confidence in an Arts Council badly mauled by internal rows and a recent cost-saving redundancy programme. The new secretary general, Mary Allen, is a Gowrie protegee and is regarded as a step in the right direction: she has the task of cutting back on the bureaucracy which bedevils the lives of council clients. Gowrie has persuaded heritage secretary Peter Brooke to appoint some real heavyweights to the council: new arrivals Trevor Nunn, Sir Richard Rodgers and Thelma Holt - figures of international stature in the world of theatre, opera and architecture - should help to repair its reputation among the malcontents of the arts world. And it will be the council, as much as the various specialist internal departments, that will decide policy. 'A lot of bets are off,' says Gowrie. 'I'm not bound to anything. I think the Arts Council is like Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Sunset Boulevard. It was a good show but it needed, and received, modification. The council needs modification.' All those who thought that Lord Gowrie would quietly accept the recent upheavals at the council - the internal reorganisation; the devolution of clients to regional arts boards; the stillborn national arts strategy - will be surprised. 'Everything is open'. With the council licked into shape Gowrie can try to persuade the government that the arts are one of the few British success stories of recent years. 'The arts are very cost-effective, with a tremendous spill over from the public to the commercial. I remember 10 years ago going to see two young Irish actors at the Roundhouse in a play about the hunger strikers. One of them was Liam Neeson.' Given the government's short sighted lack of support for a British film industry, Neeson, the star of Schindler's List, is now lost to Hollywood, and is not perhaps the best example of an Arts Council investment yielding a profitable harvest. But Gowrie reels off some current achievements. Lucian Freud is probably the best artist in the world; Thomas Allen's recent triumph as Don Giovanni at La Scala, Milan; the LSO getting four encores from the hard-boiled Germans in Frankfurt; the success of Diana Rigg as Medea on Broadway and Darcy Bussell with the Royal Ballet in Washington. Lord Gowrie believes that the message of British artistic acclaim abroad has got through to the government, to the media, and to the public. There was some surprise that Lord Gowrie, a non-executive director of Sotheby's and bankers Guinness Mahon, was so keen to accept the chairmanship of the Arts Council. To many, considering the London orchestras debacle and the ensuing cries for the abolition of the council, it seemed a poisoned chalice. And it was, after all, an unpaid post - apart from the perks of car, chauffeur and endless free tickets. Gowrie had notoriously resigned from the Conservative government in 1985 because he could not live in London on a minister's salary of Pounds 33,000. But his desire to become chairman of the Arts Council was not motivated solely by a dispassionate concern for the state of the arts. There was one appealing lollipop: the arrival in the next few months of the National Lottery. The council will distribute the share going to the arts, perhaps Pounds 100m a year. 'It sugars the pill for the whole arts community. I lobbied for a lottery 10 years ago but Lady Thatcher disapproved of gambling.' He believes the government assurances that the lottery money, designed only for capital projects in the arts, will not be used as an excuse for cutting revenue funding. He also takes a perhaps over-optimistic view of the ability of arts organisations to raise matching money to qualify for a lottery grant. But this is one of his hobby horses: his main achievement as arts minister was the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme whereby the government topped up money that arts organisations attracted from sponsors by their own efforts. As chairman of the Serpentine Gallery he had little trouble raising matching funding to take advantage of any grants going. But the Serpentine, avant-garde and with some powerful modern patrons of art as supporters, is hardly a typical British arts institution. Lord Gowrie is firm. 'I will shake my fist at the government'; but he is also practical. He has courted Mo Mowlem, the shadow heritage secretary. He gets on well with Peter Brooke, who, for no very good reason, has been tipped to lose his job in any reshuffle. Lord Gowrie comments: 'the country needs continuity in important jobs. At the Serpentine I had to deal with six different ministers'. But he is talking equally tough to the arts. He has warned companies that they must budget this year within the subsidy-cutting guidelines laid down by the Heritage department. He is not a man for the barricades. He is also frighteningly realistic, a rare quality in the arts where being starry eyed and other-worldly is almost a qualification for a job. In his first speech as chairman, to a conference organised by the Institute of New International Visual Artists, the council's most expensive new project, a planned exhibition space for multi-cultural art, Lord Gowrie terrified the audience by pointing out that the council had been generous initially but, in the current climate, he could not guarantee future funding on such a scale. He is also glad-handing less glamorous gatherings, like the association of district councils. He knows that local government spends as much on the arts as the Arts Council. It is clear that Lord Gowrie is going to throw himself enthusiastically at the arts. He hopes to furnish his new office by charming a Roger Hilton painting from the British Council to add to his modest collection of sculptures by William Turnbull and Julian Sainsbury. He will be turning up at the council five days a week, at least for the first few months. After the self-effacing Lord Palumbo, the arts are in for a rude shock. Lord Gowrie is a believer. He also sees himself as a player. He has just come back from the Cannes film festival, where he had a walk on part. This weekend he was off to the Hay-on-Wye festival, where he publicly read poetry and interviewed RS Thomas. 'I'm a participant, too. I may be only a caddy but I will keep on the greens.' Rarely has a caddy had so much influence on the game.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Government of Ghana has reaffirmed its  determination to continue to adhere strictly to international  law and the principle of good-neighborliness in its relations  with Togo, but it hopes the Togolese Government will also  reciprocate this gesture so that the people of the two countries  can live in peace and harmony.    In a statement issued in Accra today, the Ministry of  Foreign  Affairs said, true to form, that the Government of Togo has  begun a campaign of baseless accusations against Ghana in the  face of a crisis that is the product of Togo's current domestic  situation. The statement said that on 1 May, the Togolese  foreign minister summoned Ghana's charge d'affaires in Lome to  the Foreign Ministry to inform him that his government was in  possession of information that a named Togolese refugee resident  in Ghana was using other Togolese nationals to carry grenades  and other bombs into Togo from Ghana for use in crowded  restaurants, bars, and nightclubs normally patronized by  foreigners.    According to the Togolese foreign minister, the couriers  succeeded in smuggling the items into Togo by constantly  outwitting both Ghanaian and Togolese security officials at the  border. He therefore appealed to the Government of Ghana to  restrain the named Togolese refugee and also assist in putting  an end to such activities. No specific evidence of the alleged  activity of the individual was however furnished to the charge  d'affaires.    Before the Ghana Government could investigate the allegation  and [words indistinct] with its stand that he was not laying any  blame on Ghana during their first meeting. The Togolese foreign  minister again summoned the charge d'affaires to the ministry on  4 May to lodge a verbal protest against Ghana about a bomb that  had allegedly gone off in a restaurant in Lome the previous day,  wounding five French nationals and a national of Benin. The  minister claimed that the Ghana Government had done nothing as  earlier requested to restrain the said Togolese refugee,  forgetting that at his first meeting with the charge d'affaires,  he conceded that bombs had already found their way into Togo in  circumstances in which Ghana could not be blamed. The foreign  minister also threatened the anger of France and other foreign  governments against Ghana.    The statement said in view of the gravity of the accusation,  and the irrational and incomprehensible tradition of the  Togolese Government of vilifying Ghana whenever convenient to  distract attention from the consensus of its policy, the  minister of foreign affairs, Dr. Obed Asamoah, held separate  meetings today with the charges d'affaires of Togo and France to  reject the protest of the Togolese Government and to warn it  against making Ghana the scapegoat for its folly.</p>

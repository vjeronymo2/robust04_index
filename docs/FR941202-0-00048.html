			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA concurs that the compliance time can be extended somewhat. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA's intent was that the inspections be conducted during a regularly scheduled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance visit for the majority of the affected fleet, when the airplanes would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> located at a base where special equipment and trained personnel would be readily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available, if necessary. Based on the information supplied by the commenters, the FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> now recognizes that 18 months corresponds more closely to the interval representative of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most of the affected operators' normal maintenance schedules. Paragraph (a) of the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule has been revised to reflect a compliance time of 18 months. The FAA does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider that this extension will adversely affect safety, since the mandatory repetitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections of the area, as required by AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;03 will ensure that any discrepancies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be identified and corrected in the interim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has recently reviewed the figures it has used over the past several years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in calculating the economic impact of AD activity. In order to account for various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inflationary costs in the airline industry, the FAA has determined that it is necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase the labor rate used in these calculations from $55 per work hour to $60 per work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hour. The economic impact information below has been revised to reflect this increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the specified hourly labor rate. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> [ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AD. Under these circumstances, at least one operator appears to have incorrectly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumed that its airplane was not subject to an AD. On the contrary, all airplanes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA approval for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been added to this final rule to clarify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this requirement.]  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 427 Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;15, &hyph;30, and &hyph;40 series airplanes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates that 241 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $6,497  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated to be $1,609,157, or $6,677 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 114 Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes of the affected design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 46 airplanes of U.S. registry will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected by this AD, that it would take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Required parts would cost approximately $6,497 per airplane. Based on these figures, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators of Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is estimated to be $307,142, or $6,677 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the figures discussed above, the total cost impact of this AD on U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators is $1,916,299. This total cost impact figure is based on assumptions that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

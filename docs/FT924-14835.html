			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Blueprint for Hong Kong: Patten balances democracy and Chinese reality WHEN Mr Chris Patten made his way to Hong Kong in early July he stopped over in Singapore to meet Mr Lee Kwan Yew, the island republic's senior minister. 'Mr Lee gave me one very good piece of advice,' Mr Patten recalled later. 'He said I should lay all my plans out and tell the Chinese what I intend to do in the next five years.' Yesterday, Britain's 28th governor of Hong Kong was true to that advice. In a two-hour speech, opening the 1992-1993 session of the Legislative Council, Mr Patten outlined in detail his proposals for the colony's social and political development in the years up to June 30, 1997, when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty. A good two-thirds of his address was devoted to underlining his commitment to social policy in Hong Kong - a place not associated with the values of the Nanny state or even One-Nation Toryism. But the most significant part came at the end when he turned to constitutional development. Mr Patten tried to steer a course between the democratic aspirations of the people of Hong Kong and the political realities of the colony's reversion to authoritarian China, in just under five years. As he expected, democrats in Hong Kong and the Chinese government were both negative in their initial response. His proposals on the current state of constitutional affairs had been well telegraphed. He has split the membership of the Executive Council - his quasi-cabinet - from the legislature, thereby shedding the conservative representatives appointed by his predecessor, Lord Wilson. At the same time he has promised to appear before the legislature to answer its questions, pledged to give it financial and administrative autonomy and encouraged it to establish a system of parliamentary committees which can oversee and challenge the government on policy. More controversial, however, are his proposals for the conduct of the 1995 elections. He revealed in his address that Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, has formally raised with China the issue of allowing more democratically-elected seats in 1995. He held out little hope for success in this. China has set its face against allowing more than 20 of the 60 seats to be contested by popular vote. Instead, he produced a package which aims at maximum democracy within the constraint of the Basic Law, the colony's mini-constitution drafted by Beijing in the aftermath of the Tiananmen mass-acre of June 1989. He proposes to have the 230 seats of Hong Kong district and urban councils elected democratically - at present a third are appointed. He further proposes that the 230 people elected form an electoral college that will elect 10 members to the legislature in 1995. In 1995, 30 representatives will be elected through the so-called 'functional' constituencies - small lobbies representing various business and professional sectors. Mr Patten proposed that for the existing 21 functional constituencies the franchise be widened. He plans nine new functional constituencies to represent broad industry groups, such as electricity and gas. These would produce individual electorates of between 199,000 and 454,000 persons, totalling 2.5m potential voters. None of Mr Patten's proposals violates the letter of the Basic Law and this allows him to present them as being in accord with that law. 'I think that the package I put forward hangs together. I think it represents a useful but not extreme step forward in broadening participation in Hong Kong's affairs,' he told the press. 'Why have a great fuss now? Let us demonstrate that it can work. . .If China wants to change it back, then it won't lose anything in its own terms.' That quotation contains both the carrot and the stick of Mr Patten's strategy. What he seems likely to say to China is that his proposals are in China's best interests; that they will deliver to China a Hong Kong content with its political structures. But the last sentence indicates that he might just do it without approval. Mr Patten did not only address constitutional matters. Some impressive spending commitments were made. More will be spent on improving services to the elderly and the handicapped; more will be dedicated to income support, retraining, education, housing and the environment. Spending in these areas will rise 21 per cent in real terms to 1997; HKDollars 8bn (Pounds 600m) more will be spent in 1996-97 than otherwise planned. As for capital spending, HKDollars 3bn will be put towards improving Hong Kong's sewerage system - in an attempt to clean up Victoria Harbour, one of the filthiest stretches of water in the world. The funds to be deployed come from a windfall gain to the exchequer this year. Instead of a budget surplus in 1992-93 of HKDollars 7.5bn, the government now expects to have a surplus of HKDollars 13.5bn. 'Being that prudent would not be very sensible,' Mr Patten observed yesterday. Having addressed the concerns of social welfare, Mr Patten also attended to some business concerns. The announcement of a monetary authority will be well received. But it will be no Bundesbank: it will report to the financial secretary. Mr Patten's creation of a Business Council should also be welcomed The first task he has set this council is to advise him on competition policy. In spite of Hong Kong's free-wheeling capitalist image, many companies depend for their existence on exclusive or duopolistic franchises awarded to them by the government; or operate in cartels, such as banking and food retailing. The Business Council's report will be eagerly awaited.</p>

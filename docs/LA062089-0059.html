			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> 2 COMPETITORS JOIN FORCES IN BID TO PIPE GAS TO CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> Owners of two proposed pipelines to bring natural gas from Wyoming and Texas  into Southern California proposed Monday to join forces, a key strategic move  in the ongoing competition to peddle natural gas to Californians.  </P> <P> Owners of the Kern River and Mojave pipelines -- until now competing bitterly  against each other for federal permission to build interstate lines into  California -- said they agreed to merge their pipelines at Barstow.  </P> <P> The jointly owned portion of pipe carrying up to 1.1 billion cubic feet of  natural gas per day would then proceed toward the Bakersfield area, where some  would be used in the oil fields and the rest would be diverted for other  commercial or residential use.  </P> <P> A third party to the Kern-Mojave deal is Southern California Gas Co., which  agreed to buy Wyoming natural gas from the interstate pipeline to serve its  customers. The gas company would be able to buy the California section of pipe  in 20 years.  </P> <P> The alliance is a major step in a long-running process of determining which of  half a dozen pipeline projects will ultimately win federal permission,  customers and financing deemed necessary to begin construction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Compete With PG&amp;E  </P> <P> By joining forces, the Mojave and Kern projects appeared to create a major  competitor for Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. of San Francisco. The utility's  pipeline subsidiary, PGT, has signed up enough customers to fill a proposed 600  million cubic feet per day pipeline that would run directly from Canada into  Southern California.  </P> <P> "There are now clearly two front-runners," said Michael Day, deputy general  counsel of the California Public Utilities Commission, which earlier this year  instructed the various developers to work out deals among themselves. "This is  the start of the end game."  </P> <P> The PUC will recommend a favored pipeline or combination of lines, but the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has the final regulatory voice.  </P> <P> A PGT spokeswoman dismissed the Kern-Mojave venture as little more than the two  developers' original plans "in a new hat." She said SoCal Gas -- which has  refused to buy space on PGT's proposed pipeline -- would pay a higher price for  gas brought in by the pipeline announced Monday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Big New Market in Kern  </P> <P> However, the PUC's Day noted that the Kern-Mojave project could bring in gas  directly from three regions -- Wyoming, the U.S. Southwest and Canada -- a key  advantage in the view of state officials seeking to geographically diversify  California's energy sources.  </P> <P> The rush to build gas pipelines stems from the big new market for natural gas  in Kern County's oil fields and, more recently, from spot shortages in Southern  California, and new environmental pressures to replace oil with natural gas in  the state.  </P> <P> The oil firms need natural gas to generate steam that they pipe underground to  help bring Kern's tar-like crude oil to the surface. But they want to contract  for their gas directly through interstate pipelines -- such as the Kern and  Mojave proposals -- that aren't subject to what the oil firms view as the  erratic regulatory behavior of the PUC.  </P> <P> The Kern and Mojave pipelines together have apparently signed up most of the  oil companies and have enlisted SoCal Gas as well, enough to put the Kern  project above its feasibility "threshold" of 500,000 million cubic feet of gas  per day, said an aide to Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan.  </P> <P> The state of Wyoming has agreed to subsidize the building of any pipeline to  California that carries at least 350,000 million cubic feet of Wyoming natural  gas per day. Sullivan has been lobbying Californians on the virtues of gas from  his state.  </P> <P> One drawback to the Kern-Mojave project could be its size. Some question  whether the state will need an extra 1.1 billion cubic feet of gas per day, and  the cost of unused capacity would ultimately be borne by ratepayers.  </P> <P> Although the PGT and Kern-Mojave proposals appear to have the upper hand in  terms of customers, a third venture -- the Wyoming-California Pipeline Co. --  is the only one to date with a pipeline permit from the federal commission. But  it has only managed to win commitments to buy 100,000 million cubic feet per  day.  </P> <P> "We haven't seen anything that would change our plans," said a spokesman at  Coastal Corp. in Houston, owner of the Wy-Cal project. He promised an  announcement soon detailing "one or more" additional customers.  </P> <P> Mojave's proposed pipeline would originate in Topock, Ariz., near the  California border, and would have an initial capacity of 400 million cubic feet  per day. The line would be able to bring in additional supplies from the  Southwest, the major source of California's present gas supplies.  </P> <P> Mojave is owned jointly by Enron Corp., Houston, and El Paso Natural Gas Co., a  subsidiary of Burlington Resources.  </P> <P> The Kern River pipeline would begin in Opal, Wyo., with an initial capacity of  700 million cubic feet per day. It is a joint venture of units of Tenneco of  Houston and the Williams Cos. of Tulsa, Okla.  </P></p>

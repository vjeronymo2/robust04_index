			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tianjin, January 16 (XINHUA) -- More and more  foreign consumer goods, helped by lively advertising, are coming  into China's shops, with a surge expected in the run-up to the  spring festival, a traditional Chinese holiday.    Most urban residents have been aware of the flood of foreign  brands, from color televisions to motorcycles, from garments to  cosmetics, and from drinks to small buttons.    Economists here believe that with the drive of opening wider  to the outside world and a hefty rise of foreign investments in  the country, it is an inevitable outcome that more foreign  manufacturers try to get into markets in China, and consumer  goods must lead the way.    But, they said, most of the foreign brands which entered  Chinese markets were through the numerous joint ventures in the  country, while the Chinese Government has lifted the margin for  imports over the past years.    Various kinds of foreign-made goods are now being sold in  the  large department stores and modernized shopping centers, and a  few special shops have been set up to sell the foreign products.    Take for instance the Quanyechang Market, a large retail  sales center in Tianjin built 60 years ago. Among 350,000 kinds  of goods on sale in the center in 1993, 8.4 percent were  overseas-made, with a total turnover of 25 million yuan.    Even in a small shop with only a dozen employees, reporters  were told that about 50 percent of the goods sold were from  foreign-funded companies.    It is a common practice that most of the products of these  joint ventures, sold with foreign trade marks on the domestic  market, contain some parts imported from their parent firms  abroad.    The Tianjin No. 1 Light Industry Bureau has organized 96  such  joint ventures with the aid of U.S. and German companies, whose  annual turnover reached 1.2 billion yuan in 1993.    An official of the industry bureau said that as long as  these  ventures can keep balance in their foreign exchange, there is no  problem for their products to enter China's market.    The lowered import duties and restructured foreign exchange  system will encourage more foreign dealers to compete in the  domestic market, he said.    Also, he added, with a sturdy rise in their living  standards,  consumers in urban districts have begun to turn to high-quality  products.    To meet the increasing demand for foreign brands, a  newly-built Quanyechang Market building here will be put into  operation in September, mainly to sell imported goods or  products made by joint ventures.    When completed, its annual turnover is expected to reach one  billion yuan.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhao Shulan (6392 3219 5695) and Ge Xiquan (5514 6007 </F> 0538): "The Key to Successfully Carrying Out Family Planning  Work Lies in Leadership and Efforts Should Be Made To Cope With  the New Situation and To Actively Promote Reform of the Cadre  System"]    [Excerpts] "In rural work, we should persist in making an  overall plan for attaining a better-off level of moderate  prosperity and simultaneously attending to economic and family  planning work, and select cadres with education and economic  knowledge to the forefront of economic construction to assume  posts in villages where economic work is weak to lead the  peasants' march towards the goal of becoming better-off." This  requirement was set forth by Cheng Weigao, secretary of the  provincial party committee, to county and township cadres when  he inspected the work of Wuqiang County on 8 May.    Accompanied by Bai Runzhang, secretary of the Hengshui  Prefectural party committee, and Commissioner Yang Xinnong,  Cheng Weigao listened to briefings given by Wuqiang County party  committee and government leaders on the whole county's economic  development and family planning work, and held a forum on  relevant issues. He also travelled to Hebei Kewei Electronics  Company, Ltd., Wuqiang County New Year pictures museum, and  other units to inspect their work. [passage omitted]    Cheng Weigao demanded: To successfully carry out the whole  county's work, it is necessary to persist in making an overall  plan to become better-off with a moderate level of prosperity.  We must persist in simultaneously grasping both economic and  family planning work. We must not direct attention only to  economic construction at the expense of population work or  blindly persist in improving backwardness in family planning at  the expense of economic development. To grasp these two tasks,  we must urge leading cadres to further emancipate their minds,  cultivate the concept of market economy and a strong pioneering  spirit, act in line with the objectives and demands, make all  levels implement the plan aimed at becoming well-off, implement  the plan in townships and villages, and mobilize cadres to  undertake this formidable task. Meanwhile, it is necessary to  formulate plans for developing primary, secondary, and tertiary  industries for the whole county.    Cheng Weigao pointed out: We should exert efforts to grasp  reform of the organizational and cadre systems and do a good job  in resolving the issue on building the mechanisms of restraint  and incentive for the selection and appointment of cadres. It  is necessary to streamline administrative organs, mobilize  cadres of party and government organs with education and  economic knowledge to run economic entities on the forefront of  economic construction, to assume posts in village-level  organizations, and to lead peasants to attain the goal of  becoming fairly well-off. If no pressure is imposed on a cadre,  he will not have motivation and creativity. Through the  establishment of the mechanisms of restraints and incentives, we  should realistically judge cadres in accordance to the party  spirit, use cadres in accordance to their achievements in  official career, select outstanding cadres to leading posts, and  eliminate incompetent cadres.    Cheng Weigao stressed: The key to realizing the goal of  becoming well-off, accelerating reform, opening up, and economic  development, and doing a good job in family planning and  building two civilizations is to see whether we are able to pass  the stiffest test in building grass-roots organizations. This  is a very important work which we must pay attention to and  grasp firmly. In the near future, we should pay particular  attention to checking "three trends," namely the trends of  extravagance, withholding and extorting things from the people,  and boastfulness, and maintain close relations between county  and township cadres and the masses. Strenuous efforts should be  made to promote the ideological work style of working hard,  doing administrative work honestly and diligently, and seeking  truth from facts. Our living expenses must not be divorced from  local economic development and the actual living standards of  the people. We must be good at doing hard work, using our  brains, and solving difficult problems. In treating the common  people, we must be fair in enforcing law and distributing  interests and burdens to them. In handling problems, we must  give the common people a just and rational explanation, tell  them the results, and lay bare the problems, and must not  practice fraud or try to whitewash ourselves.</p>

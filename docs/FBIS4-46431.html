			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Grenade Found in Rome Park"] </F>   [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 6 -- A SRCM-type [Rome Company for  Mechanical Products] hand grenade was spotted in Rome's Villa  Borghese park Monday afternoon [6 June] by a passerby who  alerted police. Explosives experts were called in and detonated  the grenade without mishap.    The condition of the grenade and the fact that it was  partially covered with dirt led police to believe that it had  been placed at the site -- alongside the viale del Museo, one of  the many roads that wend through the vast park -- some days ago,  in turn, leading to an initial theory that, perhaps, it was  linked to the recent Rome sojourn of United States President  Bill Clinton.    Investigators later ruled this out, however, as Clinton  entered Villa Borghese from an entrance near the zoo which is  more than 500 meters from where the SRCM was found, a type of  grenade which can cause damage only if launched from close  quarters, explosive experts said.    Laboratory tests will establish the explosive power of the  grenade and how long it was on the ground.    Investigators said it was highly unlikely that it was there  during Clinton's visit as security was extremely tight and  careful checks were made of Villa Borghese each time the  American president went there to jog. (Clinton left Rome on  Saturday morning [4 June]).    SRCM (Societa' Romana Costruzioni Meccaniche) grenades  cannot  be modified, explosive experts noted. It was this same kind of  grenade that killed a policeman during a right-wing  demonstration in Milan in April of 1973. The grenade had struck  officer Antonio Marino full in the chest.    Similar grenades were found in April and May, both in Rome  and in Milan. However, the grenade in Milan was found to be a  wooden model of the type used in military training. It came to  light just before the sentence was handed down in the lengthy  Cusani kickbacks trial in Milan. In Rome, the explosive was  found near the Villa Glori police station in the somewhat posh  Parioli quarter.</p>

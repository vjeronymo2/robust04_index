			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Peking wants to vet choice of HK judges CHINA is demanding the right to have significant influence in the appointment of all judges to a court of final appeal to be set up in Hong Kong before the colony returns to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. This has been resisted by the UK and is being attacked by senior lawyers in the territory who believe it shows that Peking intends to try to undermine the colony's long-term judicial independence. China is believed to want to vet the names of judges appointed to the proposed new court before it takes Hong Kong back from Britain. It also wants to restrict the appointment of non-Chinese permanent judges, as well as expatriate judicial experts. This could lead to a further diplomatic row with Britain, which fears international confidence in Hong Kong will be hit if businessmen lose faith in the territory's legal system. Mr Anthony Rodgers, chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association, said last night: 'Any attempt to influence the appointment of judges before 1997 will whittle away at the powers of the court of final appeal. It goes to the root of judicial independence.' China's demands are similar to its stance over Hong Kong's planned HKDollars 100bn (Pounds 7.5bn) airport. In both cases it is demanding consultations and consensus on key issues that straddle the 1997 sovereignty handover. Hong Kong, backed by the UK, has been resisting this, arguing that any insistence on consensus would amount to virtual control. At some stage, however, a compromise solution will be attempted. The final appeal court is to be set up, probably with five permanent judges, to replace Britain's Privy Council, which at present hears final appeals from Hong Kong. This is contained in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on the 1997 handover, and in the Basic Law which will govern Hong Kong. These documents promise judicial independence 'free from any interference' after 1997. The Basic Law says that judges should be appointed f executive 'on the recommendation of an independent commission'. Britain had assumed that China would not try before 1997 to influence the choice of judges who are picked by an existing judicial services commission. China has told the Sino-British joint-liaison group, which is preparing for the handover, that it has a right to a say because it will inherit the judges. It has been putting forward names of Chinese lawyers and solicitors to support its argument and to try to offset the fact that there are only three ethnic Chinese among the High Court's 25 judges. China has also insisted that the opening of the final appeal court should be delayed from next year until 1994. Lawyers fear that this will seriously reduce the court's ability to build up a track record before it comes under China's direct influence.</p>

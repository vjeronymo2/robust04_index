			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Berlin shuns visit by Le Pen Berlin yesterday became the third European city to declare opposition to hosting a conference called by French far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen, Reuter reports from Berlin. A city spokesman said the city was doing all it could legally to prevent the conference from taking place in Berlin. Mr Le Pen, who failed in efforts to hold conferences in Edinburgh and Dublin, wants to hold a three-day meeting of 14 extreme right-wing members of the European parliament in Berlin, perhaps in the Reichstag, from November 8, the 55th anniversary of the Kristallnacht, the Nazis' night of mass attacks on Jews and their property.</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Ratners meets bonds redemption deadline RATNERS, the jewellery retailer, will redeem almost all its 4 per cent convertible bonds 2002 today. Redemption was anticipated because holders had the right to demand redemption since Ratners ordinary shares have fallen well below the conversion price of 456p. But it was uncertain that the company could meet the deadline because of its financial position. Redemption will cost Pounds 58.5m and the company agreed with its bankers last year it would only redeem the bonds so long as it remained within its banking agreements and did not need further borrowings. Mr James McAdam, chairman, said the development was positive. 'It shows we have been meeting all our credit obligations. Here is a big one and we are obviously meeting that,' he said. The shares added  1/4 p to 9 1/4 p. Ratners is redeeming Pounds 43.96m nominal at 133 per cent, known as the put premium. Holders of Pounds 40,000 nominal have elected not to redeem. Earlier this month Next, the fashion retailer, was also forced to redeem its convertible bond at a cost of Pounds 89.2m.</p>

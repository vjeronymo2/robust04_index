			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmoegnerova  briefed journalists at a regular news conference about this  morning's signing by the representatives of the government and  the Slovak National Bank of the letter of intent for the IMF's  standby loan. The letter of intent was sent to IMF Managing  Director Michel Camdessus. The attention of journalists at the  brief news conference focused on the commitments arising from  this document for Slovakia. Our radio was represented by Ivan  Samel.    [begin Schmoegnerova recording] The letter of intent  incorporates economic policy intentions for 1994 and 1995, which  include a budget deficit of 4 percent for 1994 and a GDP rise of  3 percent for 1995. Our further aim is to hold inflation at 10  percent in 1994 and at 8 percent in 1995. Another of our  macroeconomic aims is to maintain the internal convertibility in  1994 and 1995, with the proviso that, by 1 January 1996, we will  have prepared a so-called full internal convertibility of the  current account of the balance of payments.    Apart from these macroeconomic intentions, or rather the  government economic policy aims, the letter of intent also  contains measures related to financial policies, the external  financial sector, privatization, the financial restructuring of  enterprises, and the building up of the financial sector.

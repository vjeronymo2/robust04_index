			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / US to pay arrears on UN peace operations The US, after years as the United Nations' chief debtor, intends to pay more than Dollars 900m (Pounds 580.6m) towards UN peacekeeping costs by the end of the year, according to Ms Madeleine Albright, US ambassador to the world body, Reuter reports from New York. President Bill Clinton planned to sign a bill in the next few days authorising Dollars 1.2bn for peacekeeping, she said. The funds will cover peacekeeping arrears until the end of 1994 and allow some revenues for 1995. UN members owe the organisation Dollars 3.3bn, including Dollars 1.48bn for peacekeeping and Dollars 835m for regular dues. Of this, US arrears total Dollars 1.48bn, including Dollars 956m for peacekeeping and Dollars 530m for the regular budget. The new US appropriations concern peacekeeping only and not regular dues, but go a long way to improving the cash flow of the UN. The organisation has had difficulty in recruiting peacekeepers from poorer countries as there has been no money to pay them. Ms Albright said Dollars 335m would be made available to the UN within days and Dollars 335m would follow in September, contingent on the creation of an independent inspector-general's office which will monitor waste and mismanagement. Congress had demanded such action. The US expects to pay off the remainder of its peacekeeping debt later this year.</p>

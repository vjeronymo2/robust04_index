"The decisions adopted at the Ashgabat summit foster the  hope  for the development of integration processes in the  commonwealth. The meeting confirmed the general understanding  of the fact that coordinated activities will make it easier to  resolve the protracted economic crisis. It is not incidental  that all CIS countries announced their adherence to the economic  union of the commonwealth," the letter said.    The Kazakh prime minister suggested discussing a set of  urgent matters at the upcoming meetings of the CIS heads of  state and heads of government to be held in March, in order to  resolve the current crisis as soon as possible.    One of the major tasks is to step up work to establish a  common customs zone and a free trade zone in the Commonwealth of  Independent States. Tereshchenko believes it desirable to  accelerate the establishment of an inter-state association of  free trade.    In order to overcome the payment crisis and normalise  payment  and credit relations between CIS states, it is necessary to  adopt measures engaging the interstate bank which was set up  over a year ago but has not begun operation yet, Tereshchenko  said. He called for establishing a CIS payment centre within  the bank and reorganising it later into a currency union with a  common currency.    Tereshchenko believes that for the CIS economic union to  function normally, a coordinating body should be set up. He  suggested Moscow as the seat of such a body.    "The adoption of decisions on all these questions will  enable  (us) to begin practical realisation of the idea of the economic  union and reach a new level of relations within the CIS," the  Kazakh premier said.    Tereshchenko stressed that the Coordinating and Consultative  Committee of the commonwealth could work on these questions and  prepare respective documents. He suggested postponing the  meeting of the CIS heads of government until a later date or  holding it simultaneously with the meeting of the CIS heads of  state due to take place in Moscow on March 31, 1994.</p>

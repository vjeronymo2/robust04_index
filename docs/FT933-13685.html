			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Markets: Is the bull market finally extinct? - London WORKING FROM only a small sample of DNA, stock market scientists are trying to recreate the bull market of 1993. Why, they are asking, did the beast which roamed the London markets until relatively recently die out? After all, living conditions for the voracious animal have been near ideal. Economic news has been better than even optimists hoped, and the positive macro environment has been confirmed by some good corporate news. With those lush green shoots to satisfy its appetite, how could the beast have starved? Yet the equity market, which started in January with high hopes of a third year of growth, is now down on its opening level. Many of the scientists are hopeful that the creature has not actually died. They point out that the equity market as measured by the Footsie index, although down from over 2900 in the last three weeks, is still only a few points below the 2846.5 it stood at on January 2. Were it dead, signs of degeneration would be setting in and the index would be much lower. Further, on the second tier index - the mid 250, or Tootsie - the market is up 12 1/2 per cent so far this year. In fact, rather than having starved to death, the scientists think that their pet has been stupefied by a diet of excessive stock. The final mouthful proved to be the Pounds 5bn BT3 issue which was weighing heavily on the stomach up to the end of the trading week, when the offer closed. On top of Pounds 7bn of new equity in the first half of the year and the heavy sales of gilt-edged stock the government has had to make because of its budget deficit, it is not surprising that even such a giant animal, too stupid to realise when it has overeaten, has been stopped in its tracks. As Nick Knight, strategist at Nomura Research Institute delicately puts it: 'The market has had a good night out, and now it is feeling a bit Uncle Dick'. His remedy is either a short, sharp fall in the index to clear the indigestion, or an Alka-Seltzer in the form of a base rate cut. He points out that in the few weeks up to the BT2 share sale, in December 1991, the Footsie fell from 2550 to 2400, but it recovered all that amount in the following few weeks. The same could happen again. So how is the economy faring, according to this week's economic statistics? The first was the manufacturing output numbers for May, released on Tuesday. These were unexpectedly good, with total industrial production up 2 per cent. Then on Wednesday came news that inflation was running at only 1.2 per cent in June, the lowest level for nearly 30 years. The holy grail of economic growth combined with low inflation almost seems within grasp. Thursday was even better, with unemployment falling yet again, productivity up 10 1/2 per cent in May - a 13-year high - and average earnings up 3 3/4 per cent, a 26-year low. Judging by these figures, Norman Lamont can feel vindicated and justified in his backhanded compliment to Kenneth Clarke in the House of Commons on Thursday. As for Clarke, after only two months in charge he might consider resigning now while he is well ahead. The good economic news was backed by some positive corporate news. Marks and Spencer's annual meeting was a cheery affair, with the chairman reporting a good start to the current year. And two estate agents, Savills and John D Wood, reported a return to profits, the later only in the last quarter of its financial year. But perhaps the most interesting was from Rover, the car company owned by British Aerospace, which reported worldwide sales up 13 per cent in the first half of the year, including a 5 per cent rise in continental Europe at a time when every other car maker is suffering sharp falls in car sales there. Rover illustrates just what a bonus the devaluation of sterling has been to the UK's exporters, a competitive edge industry would be loath to lose via a recovery in the pound. So the chancellor may already be thinking about the next cut in base rates, which could reawaken the bull market. As the chart shows, the relationship between falls in base rates and the rise in the market's rating is close. If European interest rates were to fall again, and push sterling higher, the temptation to cut rates would increase. While on the one hand a rise in the pound helps keep inflation down, a cut in base rates, if passed through to lower mortgage rates, would also ward off a likely rise in inflation later in the year. Lower interest rates would also help if the economic recovery began to falter - a probability given what has been happening in the US. Elsewhere in the corporate Jurassic Park, Great Universal Stores is planning to mutate into a modern being with the ending of its two-tier share capital and a new-style, Cadbury approved board structure. GUS's shares have been stodgy performers for years, though never disappointing. Perhaps that was not down to its voting structure - by which the Pounds 4.7bn company was controlled by holders of 2.2 per cent of its shares - but to fact that it has been converting from a retailer to a property and finance group. Of its annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 475m in the year to March, a quarter was interest receivable on its cash pile of more than Pounds 1.3bn, 17 per cent came from its non-retailing trading activities, and another 10 per cent was rental income from its properties. But if GUS moved into the present this week, Tiphook, the trailer and container leasing group, re-entered the corporate equivalent of the primeval slime. After a a Pounds 21.8m loss for the year to end April and a switch to using dollars as its accounting currency, the shares were downgraded to 'speculative' by the Standard &amp; Poor's rating agency.</p>

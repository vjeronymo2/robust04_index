			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 7 [date as received] (KCNA) --  "Strengthening and developing Sino-Korean friendship are the  firm policy of our party and government as well as the desire of  our whole party and people, and we will make efforts to this  end," declared Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Central  Committee [C.C.] of the Communist Party of China, president of  the republic and chairman of the Central Military Commission.    He said this when he met Tuesday the visiting military  delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea led by  Choe Kwang, member of the Political Bureau of the C.C., the  Workers' Party of Korea, vice-chairman of the National Defence  Committee of the DPRK and chief of the General Staff of the  Korean People's Army.    Jiang Zemin said friendship between China and the DPRK is  one  provided, consolidated and developed by the respected leader of  the Korean people Comrade Kim Il-song together with Chairman Mao  Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai and other revolutionary veterans of  the Chinese people and forged in blood.    Noting that the two countries are friendly neighbours in the  lips-and-teeth relationship, he said the two parties, two  countries and two armies have traditional relations of  friendship.    He stressed that further strengthening and developing such  relations -- past or present -- is always of great significance.    "The Chinese party and government regard their friendly  relations with the DPRK important, and are satisfied with the  development of the relations between the two parties and two  countries," he added.</p>

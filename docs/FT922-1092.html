			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / GPs end 24-hour cover FAMILY doctors yesterday voted in favour of ending their current commitment to providing 24-hour cover for patients. A British Medical Association conference in London supported the replacement of the general practitioners' existing legal responsibility to provide full-time cover with more flexible arrangements. The move follows a survey of GPs earlier this year which showed strong support for the change. Dr Ian Bogle, chairman of the BMA's general medical services committee, said the issue concerned how out-of-hours cover should be provided rather than whether it should continue. Any alternative arrangements introduced would ensure continuation of home visits when necessary. The BMA leaders will now have to approach health department ministers for talks on the introduction of more flexible contracts for GPs. The government last night pressed ahead with plans for a 7 per cent cut in dental charges and dentists' fees. Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley announced that the cut would take effect from July 8.</p>

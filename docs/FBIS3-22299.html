			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Mar 7 KYODO -- The Health and Welfare  Ministry on Monday [7 March] urged the Environment Agency to ban  the herbicide CNP (chloronitrofen), widely used on rice paddies,  because it may cause gall bladder cancer.    The ministry said the acceptable daily intake of CNP set in  1977 should be scrapped. In response to the ministry's  decision, the Environment Agency decided not to register CNP as  an agricultural chemical until a new acceptable daily intake has  been agreed and urged the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries  Ministry to halt its use, officials said.    The Health Ministry made the recommendations on the basis of  a report from a committee advising it on the safety of residual  agricultural chemicals.    The Farm Ministry also said it will order local governments  to stop using CNP and replace it with substitutes in time for  the April-June planting season. Ministry officials said 12,000  tons of CNP were used last year.    The manufacturer of the chemical, Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals  Inc., will also voluntarily cease producing and marketing it, a  company executive said Monday.    Managing Director Takeshi Nakai said the company is  confident  of the safety of CNP, but decided to voluntarily stop producing  and selling it, and "abide by the government's announcement."    "Only a few farmers have purchased CNP at this point, so  there should be little confusion if we ask them to return it,"  Nakai said.    Mitsui Toatsu produces 8,000 tons of CNP annually. It has  already manufactured 4,000 tons this year. CNP sales amount to  1.4 to 1.5 billion yen each year, company officials said.    Weed killers containing CNP are normally distributed to  farmers via local agricultural associations.    The possible danger from CNP came to light after clinical  tests by Prof. Masaharu Yamamoto of Niigata University medical  faculty showed that the rate for gall bladder cancer among  residents in the Niigata Plain, one of the country's main rice  producing areas, was unusually high.    Civic organizations in the Niigata area have demanded that  the government ban the chemical.    The Health and Welfare Ministry's advisory body concluded  that there was a regional correlation between CNP and gall  bladder cancer, but also said it was difficult to establish a  causal relationship.    Yamamoto said there is sufficient statistical correlation  between the use of CNP and gall bladder cancer, but any proof of  a causal relationship will have to wait until there are signs of  a drop in the death rate from the cancer after the ban on CNP  takes effect.</p>

			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON VIEW: TALKING UP SCIENCE AT MUSES LUNCH  </P> <P> Those who left the Muses of the California Museum of Science and Industry 25th  celebration Woman of the Year luncheon at the JW Marriott walked away with  little quartz crystal clocks inscribed Muses as well as the message from the  honoree, Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds of the California State University system,  that even more needs to be done to push scientific education among the young,  which is what Muses members do through their science scholarships, seminars and  workshops.  </P> <P> "Unless steps are taken immediately," Reynolds said, "we could suffer a  shortfall of as many as 560,000 science and engineering professionals by the  year 2010." The chancellor has served as co-chair of the Federal Task Force on  Women, Minorities and the Handicapped in Science and Technology. Research, she  noted that today 75% of the graduate students receiving financial support from  university engineering departments are foreign nationals, and in the period  between 1978 and 1987, the percentage of Ph.D.s earned in engineering by  American students declined from 53.6% to 45.2% of the total. "Clearly," she  said, "we cannot be competitive as a nation if we have to rely on other  countries for our science and engineering needs. We have to grow our own crop  of future scientists."  </P> <P> The luncheon was planned by Betty Miller. Heading the program were Margaret  Thompson, Kevin O'Connell, June Haver MacMurray, Joe Campanella and Jan  Crowther.  </P> <P> PROMINENT: John Brooks Slaughter will be inaugurated as 11th president of  Occidental College on Friday at 2:30 p.m., and two days of festivities are  upcoming. Former Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm delivers the keynote address at  the Inaugural Symposium following a black-tie dinner and reception today on  campus.  </P> <P> Among the prominent Southern Californians attending festivities will be Donn  (trustees chairman) and Peggy Miller, Dr. Allan and Weta Mathies Jr., Charles  and Carolyn Miller, Peter and Pamela Mullin, David and Dona Schultz, Frank and  Rary Simmons, Roy Anderson, Robert and Carol Finch, Walter and Darleen Gerken,  Stanley and Ileen Gold, Stafford and and Robert Grady, Claremont-McKenna  president Jack and Jil Stark.  </P> <P> Among those participating in a symposium on "Preparing the Liberal Arts College  for the Twenty-first Century" will be James J. Whalen, chairman of the board of  trustees of the American Council on Education; Alexander W. Astin, director of  the Higher Education Research Institute of Los Angeles; Richard J. Mahoney,  chairman and CEO of Monsanto Co., and John D. Maguire, president of the  Claremont University Center and Graduate School.  </P> <P> THE DERBY: Elaborate picnics will be brought to Santa Anita Park on Saturday,  and diners will be among 100 Rolls-Royces and Bentleys whose owners have  reserved the infield. The event sparks activity for the 52nd running of the  Santa Anita Derby, the $500,000 race to determine the 3-year-old championship  of the West. Of course, it's a prelude to the Kentucky Derby.  </P> <P> Santa Anita president Robert Strub and his wife Betty will be entertaining at  luncheon in the Directors Room. British Consul Gen. Donald Ballentyne and his  wife Elizabeth will be there as will Thomas Meeker, president of Churchill  Downs, and his wife, Carol, coming from Louisville, Ky.  </P> <P> We're told tulips and peach and cherry blossoms will add to the ambiance as  Patsy Pope, Grant Horn and Sheila and William Shay all come from the north, to  join Southern Californians including Robert and Cammie Strub, John Strub, Gerry  and Pat Frawley. Peggy Whittingham and Alice Rodich.  </P> <P> LUNCHEON THAT GREW: Helene Irvin and Gloria Holden hosted what started out as a  little luncheon (planned at the Ritz Carlton in Washington during the Bush  Inauguration) for Gayle Wilson, wife of Sen. Pete Wilson, but it grew into an  almost-no-regrets affair for 95 of the busiest women in Los Angeles at the Los  Angeles Country Club on Tuesday noon.  </P> <P> Brenda Himmel in Santa Monica did the apricot and ivory invitations embossed  "Gayle." Place cards were little chocolate blocks, ribboned with streamers  printed "Gayle," and iced with names of the guests. Jacob Maarse of Pasadena  built floral arrangements tall enough to intersperse the chandeliers. The heat  almost wilted the club flowers, as well as those ladies who opted for Adolfos  and a little wool, such as Rosemarie Stack, Joan Hotchkis and Mary Davis; but  most were prepared for the temperatures with open-air cottons and trim linens  of Ungaro ilk, including Beth Lowe, Susan Turtelot, Libby Doheny, Linda  Blackburn (who chairs the fashion-chic Mannequins "Afternoon With Eve" this  spring) and Suzanne Marx.  </P> <P> There was no soliciting, no money talk. The G-word was never uttered as Helene  Irvin reeled off Gayle's major accomplishments -- activist for Phoenix House  Foundation (drugs), AIDS, Alzheimer's, Children's Institute (child abuse),  House Ear Institute in Los Angeles, program chairman for Congressional Wives.  </P> <P> At the head table, the honoree was between Margaret Brock and Jane Weintraub,  and in the same circle with both hostesses were Erlenne Sprague, Joanne  Kosberg, Betty Wilson, Lydia Heston and Robin Parsky.  </P> <P> More in the crowd were Jean Smith (wife of the former U.S. attorney general),  Jane (Mrs. Freeman) Gosden, Ginie Braun, Kate Graham, Betty Morgan, Maude  Chasen, Carolbeth Korn, Suzanne Cavlovick (new director of the Fifth Avenue  Club at Saks in Beverly Hills), Iris Dart, Raylene Meyer, Betty Irvin, Olivia  Roth, Ramona Cappello, Marcia Hobbs, Bonnie Green, Virginia Rogers, Carol King,  Nadine Tilley, Sandra Ausman and Genevieve Ryan.  </P></p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / How to Spend It: 'That's just what I've always wanted' - Gift ideas for the person with a special interest, here are a number of suggestions that you might not have thought of . . . / The Gardener What to buy for enthusiasts and experts - it is an annual dilemma. Their hobbies ought to provide a host of ideas. But what if they have already got your chosen gift, or - even worse - what if it is not the right make or design? The Weekend FT's experts offer some suggestions . . . My Christmas suggestions are for seeding, cutting and clearing up. The two best secateurs are the Felco Classic at Pounds 35.99 or the Wilkinson Sword Medium Anvil at Pounds 22.99, which I marginally prefer; every gardener loses the secateurs at least once a year and needs new ones. If their garden is now growing furiously, they will also need long-handled pruners. I like the Gardena 860 BL at Pounds 44.79. For weeds, the essential is a Wilkinson Sword Classic Hoe, rectangular-headed at Pounds 21.99. Gardeners never use enough food; encourage them with a big pack of Phostrogen at Pounds 4.79 and a potash-rich 500ml box of Tomorite at Pounds 2.49; both can be applied so easily with a hose if you fix on the no-clog Miracle Gro Feeder which comes with highly nitrogenous Miracle Gro, which I do not use, but is particularly cheap at Pounds 6.99. Alternatively, you can water on fertiliser where the best cans are made by Haws and there is now a cheap and cheerful Haws Practical model at Pounds 9.99. Everybody also needs some line of attack against pests. My favourite slug and snail killer is the admirable Growing Success which is both organic and lethal. You may prefer to give a Bosbag at Pounds 8.39 on the grounds that it sounds like your horticulture partner anyway. In fact, it is an all-purpose piece of sheeting which will stand up as a rounded bag and take all the garden rubbish without involving a wheelbarrow. It will also hold dead leaves; please do not give anyone one of those awful leaf-blowers which are all the rage and so needlessly noisy that they ruin the neighbours' weekends.</p>

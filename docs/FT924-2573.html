			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Demand for NMA offer vanishes as share prices tumble HONG KONG'S largest flotation since mid-1990, the public offer of shares in National Mutual Asia (NMA), has been only 50 per cent subscribed as a result of the collapsing share prices that have accompanied the Sino-British war of words over the development of democracy in the colony. Underwriters were left with more than HKDollars 300m (USDollars 38.9m) worth of shares - believed to be the worst under-subscription for a new issue in Hong Kong's history, far exceeding underwriting obligations for the poorly received Sime Darby flotation, in late 1985. The row between Britain and China over Hong Kong governor Mr Chris Patten's political reform proposals had already resulted in the withdrawal of the HKDollars 300m flotation of South China Brokerage. NMA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Australian life assurance and investment group, was to raise HKDollars 1.08bn, through a placement and open offer. The HKDollars 431m placement was almost 10 times over-subscribed, but demand for the public offer vanished in the wake of last week's 12 per cent drop in the Hang Seng Index. Provisional estimates last night indicated the HKDollars 646m public offer was 50 per cent subscribed. The offer was fully underwritten, with Standard Chartered Asia acting as lead manager, and Baring Brothers, Morgan Stanley, Daiwa Securities and S. G. Warburg Securities as co-underwriters. Brokers were not surprised at the response. The research director of one local securities house said: 'There was strong initial support for the issue and the over-subscription for the placement was sufficient to cover the whole flotation. But given the current uncertainty, the shares are bound to perform badly at the start'. The underwriting agreement contained a force majeure clause, whereby it was possible for the underwriters to terminate the deal, claiming an extreme and unforeseeable change in circumstances. But at the time the offer opened, Standard Chartered said it was confident the flotation would be well received.</p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / First fraud case data published by SIB THE SECURITIES and Investments Board, the financial services regulatory body, has carried out more than 600 investigations since it was created three years ago, it disclosed yesterday. Of those, four have led to convictions. Twenty cases of unauthorised trading involving several million pounds of investors' money are at various stages of investigation or trial. Two more cases are to be tried this year. The SIB's first reported statistics since its was set up in 1988 showed the state of breaches of Section Four of the 1986 Financial Services Act which requires anyone carrying out investment business to be authorised by the SIB. 'We think we have acted promptly after notification of possible frauds,' said Mr Jeff Thomas, deputy director of the enforcement division. 'But clearly there is a lot of fraud not yet detected.' Six individuals have been convicted and imprisoned as a result of investigations headed by the SIB since August 1988.</p>

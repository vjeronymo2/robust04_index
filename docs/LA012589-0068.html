			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> A cellular phone industry group announced that a disagreement over transmission  standards had been settled, helping to clear the way for the next generation of  cheaper and more secure mobile phones. The Cellular Telecommunications Industry  Assn. said its board unanimously endorsed a decision reached last week by the  standard-setting Telecommunications Industry Assn. The agreement covers the  method by which phone calls will be sent over the air in the form of digital  signals, the language of computers. The first cellular phones that use digital  transmission are expected to be introduced in the United States in 1991.  </P></p>

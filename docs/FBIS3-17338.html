"In this  connection I felt that the talk I had in Brussels with NATO  Secretary General Manfred Woerner was very useful. His  conceptual clarifications convinced me that it would be  appropriate for us to cooperate with the Atlantic Alliance," he  indicated. According to the Armenian minister, a NATO expert  group will visit Armenia shortly to study the details of his  country's possible membership in the Partnership for Peace  program. The Armenian foreign minister, who feels that,  generally speaking, the initiative is positive, would  nevertheless like it to lead to the creation of precise  mechanisms capable of ensuring stability in the CSCE's  geopolitical area of responsibility, including of course the  area of the former USSR.    Mr. Papazyan said that Armenia's position on this issue was  quite close to Russia's. He also said that he has recently been  holding a permanent dialogue with his Russian counterpart, Mr.  Kozyrev, so that they can "coordinate" their respective  positions on this matter. According to the Armenian minister,  Armenia feels that the question of concrete security mechanisms  within the framework of the CSCE is crucially important in so  far as the efforts of the "Minsk Group" to resolve the problem  of Karabakh have so far failed to bear fruit, precisely because  of the absence of an instrument likely to achieve these efforts  on the ground.    The Armenian foreign minister, who deplored the  international  community's detachment from the problems in the trans-Caucasus  region, noted that the Russian Army represented the only  potential guarantor of stability in that region, in so far as  the West is clearly not prepared to send its intervention forces  into the trans- Caucasus. At the same time he also made it  clearly understood that the presence of international observers  in this region would be essential to ensure not only stability  but also to supervise Russian troops activity.    Speaking about the situation in Karabakh, Mr. Papazyan said  that the negotiations currently continuing in Moscow between the  representatives of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Karabakh -- with the  mediation of Russia and the CSCE -- have encouraged the truce  that has recently emerged in the field. Nevertheless, he said  he was rather pessimistic as to the possibility of seeing these  negotiations lead to a feasible political solution to the  conflict, "because it is highly probable that Azerbaijan once  again views them [the negotiations] as an opportunity to regroup  its forces in order to relaunch the offensive against the  Armenians in Karabakh." According to Mr. Papazyan, "this war has  already gone too far." The Armenian minister thinks that this  tragic evolution of the conflict, which he feels, by the way, to  be strictly Azerbaijan's internal problem, is primarily due to  the fact that the Azeri leaders have never truly renounced their  attempts to resolve the problem by military means. However,  according to the Armenian foreign minister, any persistence by  Baku in this direction is likely to force Armenia to intervene  "for good" in this conflict, which risks taking on an especially  dangerous international dimension.</p>

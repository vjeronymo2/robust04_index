			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS Boris Belyakov] </F>   [Text] Samara, June 6 TASS -- Oleg Sysuyev has been elected  the mayor of Samara, a major industrial centre on the Volga, in  the first popular municipal elections of this kind on Sunday.  Seventy-three per cent of the voters cast their ballots in his  favour. Sysuyev's closest rival scored ten times fewer votes.    Sysuyev was appointed the head of administration of Samara  by  Yeltsin's decree two years ago, the Sunday elections gave him  popular support needed for further work.    Although the economic situation of Samara has never been as  complex as lately, none of the municipal development programmes  has been aborted under Oleg Sysuyev. The city transport network  has been renewed and three new underground stations have been  added to the underground railway system. Housing has been built  apace, and many hospitals and educational establishments have  received new equipment.    The mayor of Samara pins great hopes on the development of  partnership relations with the German city of Stuttgart,  American St. Louis and Bulgarian Stara Zagora. Exchange of  experience has already involved scientists, doctors, teachers  and policemen and is likely to do good to the partner cities and  will help the nations establish better contacts.</p>

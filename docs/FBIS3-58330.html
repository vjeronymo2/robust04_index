			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Eberhard Wisdorff editorial: "Consideration for Yeltsin"] </F>   [Text] For the third time since the collapse of the East  Bloc, the 16 heads of state and government of the NATO countries  tried at their summit in Brussels to give clearer contours to a  new comprehensive security structure for Europe. In mid-1990 in  London the alliance formulated the offer for cooperation with  the East and, a few months later, it confirmed it in the CSCE  Charter of Paris. A year later in Rome NATO adopted its new  strategic concept, which is adapted to the changed situation.  Almost at the same time, the 12 member states of the  then-European Community agreed on the treaty for the  establishment of the European Union (EU), which envisages an  independent foreign and security policy by using the Western  European Union (WEU) as a complementary institution to NATO.    Already these few stations mark the speed of development  following the upheavals in the East. Nevertheless, now in  Brussels there were once again new factors, such as, above all,  the uncertainty about the Russian reform policy, that  characterized the debate, at the end of which it remains unclear  what the security structures on the old continent will be like  in the end but whose result should clarify the relationship  between Europe and the United States and the former East Bloc at  least for some time.    In shaping relations with Russia, the other CIS republics,  as  well as the Central East European countries, which are all  already cooperating with NATO in the North Atlantic Cooperation  Council, the alliance partners agreed to the U.S. concept of  Partnership for Peace without any major debate.  <H5>  Bilateral Cooperation </H5>   It offers these countries the opportunity to introduce close  bilateral military cooperation with NATO, for instance through  joint maneuvers, training for peace missions, and consultations  in the case of a threat. Accession to the alliance, which is  demanded above all by the reform states Poland, Hungary, the  Czech Republic, and Slovakia as well as by the Baltic countries  after the election success of Russian rightist-nationalist  Zhirinovskiy, is offered as a prospect, but without giving any  specific date.    This is done out of consideration for Russian fears of being  surrounded and avoids drawing a new, at least theoretical border  in Europe. This priority set by Washington is useful certainly  as long as there are justified hopes that the Moscow reform  process will be continued. Furthermore, this method of action  also corresponds to the rhythm of the EU, which has established  links with most of these countries through an association with  the promise of membership at a later, unspecified date.  <H5>  The Second Pillar of the Alliance </H5>   For the relationship between Europe and its most important  partner on the other side of the Atlantic U.S. President Bill  Clinton surprisingly provided a positive emphasis in Brussels by  confirming a minimum U.S. troop presence of 100,000 men and the  express support of the independent foreign and security policy  development of the EU as a second pillar of the alliance. The  indispensable security policy ties between the United States and  Europe have been clearly affirmed. At the same time, the new  Common Foreign and Security Policy of the Twelve can now be  initiated more quickly after the Maastricht Treaty came into  force with delay at the beginning of November 1993.    The envisaged close interlacement with the WEU, of which  almost all EU states are members, can be intensified because of  the readiness of the alliance to enable the WEU to use NATO  resources for independent operations. During his visit to the  Brussels EU Commission today the agreement on concluding the  Uruguay round, which was achieved recently after long conflicts  between the EU and the United States, gives Clinton the basis  for contributing further elements to improving the Transatlantic  climate also in the field of the economy.    The NATO summit gives the impression of being a further step  in the direction toward a new security policy structure in  Europe after the end of the Cold War. Of course, it would be  more convincing if the partners were not still helpless in the  face of the bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia. The renewed  affirmation of the alliance's readiness for limited air strikes  at Serbian positions in Bosnia hardly gives rise to hope in view  of the previous experiences.</p>

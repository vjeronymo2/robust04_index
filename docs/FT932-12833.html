			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Banks may alter loans practice HIGH street banks are likely to consider changes to their code of practice in the light of cases where individuals have been surprised by the amount of money for which they are held responsible when their spouse's business collapses. The British Bankers' Association code says banks should advise individuals asked to guarantee a loan for someone else to seek independent advice. The association said further safeguards might be added to the code next year as a result of cases such as that of Mrs Bridget O'Brien, who is resisting Barclays' attempt to repossess her house. Lord Inchyra, the association's director-general, said banks might consider a safeguard to discourage individuals from unknowingly becoming responsible for a larger sum when the loan they guarantee subsequently grows. Mrs O'Brien's case is being heard in the House of Lords this week, and a judgment is expected in several weeks. The Appeal Court last year overturned a county court judgment that would have allowed Barclays to repossess her home. The association has started a general review of the code of practice following its implementation in March last year. Any changes would apply from next March.</p>

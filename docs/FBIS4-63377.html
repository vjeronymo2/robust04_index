In her Friday's interview with Interfax Samolis explained  that some former Soviet servicemen taken prisoner "in the Afghan  war" still remained abroad.    According to Samolis, she did not mean any concrete country,  in particular Pakistan.    Members of Russia's Foreign Ministry explained to Interfax  that former Soviet servicemen are held on Afghan soil. "Had our  prisoners of war been in Pakistan, the Pakistanis would have  extradited them long ago," a high-ranking Russian diplomat told  Interfax's correspondent.</p>

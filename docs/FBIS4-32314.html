			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Adnana Hadziahmetovic] </F>   [Text] [Hadziahmetovic] Kresimir Zubak, president of the  [Bosnia-Herzegovina] Federation and member of the delegation at  the negotiations in Geneva, has presented a report to the  deputies in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly on the talks on the  military agreement, that is, on the ending of hostilities in our  country. Stressing that he was in the unfortunate position of  having to report on the conclusions of the Geneva talks after a  period of time had elapsed and after the public had already been  fully briefed on them, Kresimir Zubak stressed once again that  our delegation had not agreed to hold direct talks with the  Serbian aggressor side (?at any time). Talks had been held with  Akashi and a group of experts. He said that the delegation did  not want to discuss the draft agreement on the ending of  hostilities until guarantees had been given that the aggressor's  soldiers had withdrawn from the 3-km zone around Gorazde.    He also stressed that the delegation had not accepted any  proposals made by the Serbian aggressor side. The content of  the agreement on the ending of hostilities [words indistinct] to  stop hostilities for four weeks. [words indistinct] that the  forces of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Serbian  aggressor be separated by UN forces and that the agreement on  the ending of hostilities be linked to the talks with the  contact group on a (?partial) and comprehensive peace solution.    At the end of his report, Kresimir Zubak said:    [Begin Zubak recording] (?In that sense) I do not think that  there is any reason why this distinguished house should not  conclude that we, as the victims of aggression, have succeeded  for the first time in imposing solutions that suit us. In other  words, our solutions were not only [words indistinct] but were  principled and directed at a final solution [words indistinct]  [end recording]    [Hadziahmetovic] [words indistinct] The deputies of the  Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina unanimously and without debate  adopted the reports on the work of our delegations in Geneva,  approved of the work of the delegations, and supported all  efforts aimed at finding a peaceful solution in our country.</p>

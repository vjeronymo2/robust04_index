			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: STILL KICKING  </P> <P> Chuck Norris, now age 50 and absent from the screen for more than a year, will  see if he's got some kick left when he returns to the cameras in June, for  Cannon Pictures' "50/50."  </P> <P> The action-adventure has him teaming with a yet-to-be-cast buddy to oust a  dictator and restore to power the "last democratic president" of the fictional  country of Tengara.  </P> <P> To be directed by Charles Martin Smith (the upcoming "Boris and Natasha"), it's  one of two Norris projects on tap. The already-shot "Delta Force II" is due in  the fall.  </P> <P> Norris' box-office power has waned since his back-to-back 1985 hits, "Invasion  U.S.A." ($17.5 million gross) and "Code of Silence" ($18 million), and 1987's  "Delta Force" ($17 million).  </P> <P> His last film, "Hero and the Terror" (1988), had ticket sales of just $6  million. "Braddock: Missing in Action" (1988) also grossed $6 million. Pat H.  Broeske  </P></p>

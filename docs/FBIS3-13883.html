Subhi  Abu-Khalil is suspected of having killed Palestinians who were  believed to have cooperated with Israel.    In the village of 'Anabta in Samaria, a Palestinian was  wounded when soldiers opened fire on stone-throwers. [passage  omitted]    An Israeli was lightly wounded in the head when he was hit  by  a stone while he was driving on the Ben Shemen-Jerusalem road,  near the village of Bayt 'Ur al-Tahta.    The Tel Aviv Magistrates Court has sentenced Gaza resident  Masrah Barbah to life in prison, after finding him guilty in the  murder of Moshe Becker, a citrus grower from Rehovot, two months  ago. Another suspect in the murder, Hani Abu-Sittah, denied the  charges and is currently being tried.</p>

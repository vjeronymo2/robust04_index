			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW JERSEY;  </P> <P> FLORIO SIGNS AUTO INSURANCE RATE BILL  </P> <P> Gov. James J. Florio signed into law a bill to lower New Jersey's car insurance  rates by 20%.  </P> <P> Allstate Insurance Co. Vice President Edward Young said the firm would file  suit within 30 days on the grounds that the law violates constitutional  protections of due process. New Jersey's insurance rates average $1,000 a year.  The bill eliminates the Joint Underwriting Assn., a state-operated pool for  high-risk drivers that has a $3.1-billion debt. A $222 per car annual tab to  keep the pool from bankruptcy will be dropped. The law requires the insurance  industry to pay $1.4 billion of the pool's debt.  </P></p>

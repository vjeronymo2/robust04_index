			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Novosibirsk Oblast Procurator Vladimir </F> Tokarev by VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK correspondent Irina Timofeyeva;  place and date not given: "The Procuracy Never Handed Out  Gingerbread..."]    [Text] Last year Novosibirsk Oblast Procuracy  investigators referred to courts 869 criminal cases, of which  more than half concerned premeditated murders. It oversees the  investigation of more than 100,000 criminal cases. The procuracy  filed with the courts 1,347 claims for compensation for damages;  about 1,000 of them on behalf of the state, and the rest--on  behalf of individuals. Over four months of this year 14 cases in  the economic sphere alone, involving a total amount of 1.624  billion rubles [R], were referred to the arbitration court. Some  of them have been considered and resolved.    These figures were given to our correspondent at the  oblast procuracy shortly before the date when this state body  celebrated its 72d anniversary--counting only the Soviet period.  I think it is more correct to count its age since the time of  Peter the Great, who created the procuracy at the beginning of  the 18th century. The anniversary provided a pretext for asking  Novosibirsk Oblast Procurator Vladimir Vasilyevich Tokarev a few  questions.    [Timofeyeva] Recent events are such that one gets the  impression that there are forces trying if not destroy then at  least to weaken the Russian procuracy.    [Tokarev] Our function is to uphold the laws currently in  effect. The procuracy cannot be everybody's favorite because it  has never handed out gingerbread. The wave of criticism over the  past few years, some of which was fair, was inevitable  considering our history. It is quite possible that not everybody  is happy with the very existence of an oversight body. Remember,  just recently it was only through Kazannik's incredible efforts  that the article on the procuracy was literally rammed through  in the new constitution.    [Timofeyeva] What is actually happening with general  procurators? What is the view from here, from the provinces?    [Tokarev] I know no more than you do--mainly what I read in  the press. My opinion is that Stepankov, although he was young  when he came into this job, had already earned authority and  respect by then. He turned out to be a mature leader and did  much to preserve and strengthen the procuracy. Kazannik is a  highly educated, intelligent, and decent man, but not versed in  political games. His problem was that he looked at life from the  university chair viewpoint. As to what is next--we will see...  In principle, no matter who is at the top we have to carry out  our duty here.    [Timofeyeva] It is bad taste these days to quote Lenin.  Still, I will take a chance and quote a famous phrase: "...there  cannot be a Kaluga legality and a Kazan legality--there) should  be one, all-Russia legality..." How topical is this idea today?    [Tokarev] I would say it is very topical. We live in a  rapidly developing society. The new constitution says that krays  and oblasts have the right to carry out their own legal  regulation, including adopting laws. Apparently in the desire to  make full use of this right the oblast council adopted a plan  for legislative work. It envisages the adoption of nearly 40  different laws and decrees over a short period of time. Without  belittling in any way the merits and abilities of the new deputy  corps, I will dare to voice a certain doubt. I think that some  deputies have a somewhat simplistic idea of the lawmaking  process. The adoption of any law, even one limited to the  oblast, requires quite lengthy and painstaking work. Another  example. Currently the oblast administration, concerned at the  way the situation is developing, is preparing a number of  documents on matters of combating crime, stabilizing the  economic situation, and others. Looking at some of them brings  one to the conclusion that the authors attempt to resolve the  accumulated problems by strong-arm, proscriptive methods,  disregarding first of all current federal legislation. It is not  good when each rayon begins to write its own "constitution." We,  at least, do not expect an easy life.    [Timofeyeva] This means that the role of your agency will  grow. And what are your relations with the judiciary? In  particular, with respect to appeals on arrests?    [Tokarev] We have normal businesslike relations. Over more  or  less the past year and a half we have been preparing our staff  for the competitiveness of the process, since the procurator's  role in court will be somewhat different. With respect to  appeals of arrests, a law has been adopted and it has to be  complied with. There can be no argument about this. The courts  do it, albeit not without mistakes. Now we are sorting out the  situation, trying first and foremost to identify our own  shortcomings. A serious oversight on the part of lawmakers is  the impossibility of appealing such a court decision.    [Timofeyeva] Vladimir Vasilyevich, what kind of crimes worry  you most?    [Tokarev] The number of so-called everyday murders keeps  growing. In 1992 there were 134 of them in the oblast; last year  there were 220, and 89 have already been committed over four  months of this year. One can pontificate endlessly on the causes  of everyday murders: apathy, bitterness, drinking, loss of the  old forms of social work--which was not all that bad--with  problem families. Very troublesome is the increase in the number  of grave crimes against individuals motivated by greed. In April  we opened a case on the murder of an Armenian family, including  a four-year-old girl. A large sum of money had disappeared. The  professionalism of the Dzerzhinskiy Rayon Department of Internal  Affairs staff and their close interaction with oblast procuracy  investigators produced results: Two weeks ago a suspect, also an  Armenian, was detained and charged.    [Timofeyeva] What about economic crime?    [Tokarev] We are investigating, for instance, the case of  the  director of GPI [state design institute] Sibgiproelektro and his  deputy, who are charged with extorting bribes for leasing space.  So far the amounts involved are R3 million and $2,000. We  recently referred to court a case that had been reported in the  press, including by your newspaper. I mean the attempt to  solicit a large bribe by the deputy chief of the oblast state  trade inspectorate; she is also charged with embezzlement.  Investigation is also underway in the case of employees of the  Rosstrakh joint-stock company's security service. In order to  "collect" debts, they took hostages. There have been instances  of theft of arms and ammunition from military  warehouses--handguns, ammunition, and dynamite sticks were  stolen. Ten persons have been charged, eight of whom are under  arrest.    Speaking of the economy, I am concerned at the artificial  washout of state property. For instance, in the total property  of an enterprise converted to joint-stock holding only 5 percent  belongs to physical persons, and the rest--to the state.  Nevertheless, currently the lawmaker in the event of theft  treats the entire property as private. The role of the state is  falling. But we all know that if the state is strong, life will  become easier for all its citizens--stockholders, entrepreneurs,  and workers...</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> TREATED LIKE PEONS  </P> <P> We have been treated like peons now since 1953, since the government took  control of (Olvera Street). Our voice has been excluded from management  decisions, from cultural decisions, and our community seems to have now been  excluded in the writing of the (plan).  </P> <P> When they wrote the bidding documents (for the restoration project), they  didn't consult with anybody in terms of historians, and our professionals that  have significant insight into how those documents could have been drafted.  </P> <P> I think it's just typical of the Department of Recreation and Parks to let that  voice go unheard. I have tried very hard to establish credibility for the  merchants, to be able to give them a voice, a real voice in the future of  Olvera Street, because that's been absent.  </P> <P> I question the city's position that they are not intending to spend a red  nickel on their birthplace.  </P> <P> I think that the city has a responsibility as this is their only historical, I  should say their primary historical landmark, and the only cultural landmark  dedicated to the Latino heritage.  </P></p>

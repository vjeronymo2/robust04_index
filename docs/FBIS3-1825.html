			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Michael Smith, Kiwi Lee and Jim Cheung] </F>   [Text] Sino-British co-operation on the new airport  project has suffered a further setback with negotiations  unlikely to resume for another four weeks following the latest  political row.    Senior government sources said yesterday they were not  expecting China to agree to a meeting of the Sino-British  Airport Committee for at least another four weeks.    The opinion conflicts with Chief Secretary Anson Chan's  statement last week that she hoped a date would be set for talks  this week.    The future of airport talks was clouded last week when China  accused Britain of slamming the door on talks on economic issues  by pushing ahead with the second stage of Governor Chris  Patten's constitutional reform bill and releasing a White Paper  on the 17 rounds of Sino-British political talks.    Sources said the Hong Kong government was expecting a  month-long war of words between the two sides before tempers  cooled enough for talks to resume.    The government would have to form a contingency plan in May  or June this year for the additional injection of funds into the  multibillion-dollar project if China continued to refuse to  discuss the issue.    The latest injection of funds will carry airport works until  July this year but an agreement is hoped for before that time.    A senior source said the airport would not be completed by  mid- 1997, but if works remained on schedule it should be  finished about three months later.    Meanwhile, Meeting Point leader Fred Li said the government  had agreed that the posts of the Airport Corporation Chairman  and the Chief Executive should belong to two individuals.    A pro-democracy political faction urged the government to  devise a stringent mechanism to control the charges and  management of the future airport.    The Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood (ADPL)  submitted its last-minute recommendations on the Airport  Corporation Bill to Secretary for Economic Services Gordon Siu  yesterday following the closure of a two-month consultation  period on the bill.    ADPL vice-chairman Leung Kwong-cheong said the government  should establish an effective system to regulate the charges of  the new airport.    He also suggested one-third of the corporation's Board of  Directors should be directly elected legislators.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Technical Revision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> General provisions relating to Medicaid services are included in 42 CFR part 440. Section 440.160, Inpatient psychiatric services for individuals under age 21, currently contains an abbreviated definition of the psychiatric <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 21 benefit. This abbreviated definition has caused confusion because it does not make it clear that this benefit must always be provided in a psychiatric facility. Therefore, we propose to revise the definition in this section to list the three possible settings and to cross refer to the detailed requirements in subpart D of part 441 and subpart F of part 483.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Collection of Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regulations at &sect;441.152 contain collection of information requirements that are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). The information collection requirements concern resident information. The respondents who will provide the information include physicians and medical personnel. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to be 30 minutes per respondent. A notice will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  when approval is obtained. Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection and recordkeeping requirements should direct them to the OMB official whose name appears in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section of this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Response to Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive on a proposed rule, we are unable to acknowledge or respond to them individually. However, we will consider all comments that we receive by the date and time specified in the `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> DATES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' section of this preamble to the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Regulatory Impact Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed regulation would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, psychiatric residential treatment facilities and psychiatric hospitals are considered to be small entities. Individuals and States are not included in the definition of small entity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis for any final rule that may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such analysis must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital with fewer than 50 beds located outside a Metropolitan Statistical area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are various aspects of this proposed regulation that might have some cost or saving, but the net impact of all of them appears to be negligible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The establishment of the psychiatric residential treatment facility as a new category of Medicaid facility for the purposes of inpatient psychiatric care has varying impacts. On one hand, daily charges at such facilities are projected to be lower than at psychiatric hospitals. On the other hand, lengths of stay seem to be longer, probably due to the less acute, more chronic nature of the conditions they are designed to treat. However, if we assume that some recipients are currently getting inappropriate care in more expensive settings merely because of Medicaid regulations, then this regulation may save some money. This assumption, though, is impossible to verify.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

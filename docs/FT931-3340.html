			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Row on prescription charge A PROCEDURAL manoeuvre by Labour MPs forced Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, to the government despatch box in the Commons last night to defend an increase in prescription charges. The 50p rise - from Pounds 3.75 to Pounds 4.25 per item - is due to take effect from April 1. A Labour attempt to annul the order authorising the increase was defeated by a government majority of 60 (289-229). Mrs Bottomley had not intended to participate in the debate, but was left with no alternative when Labour MPs refused to give permission to Dr Brian Mawhinney, the health minister, to make the opening and the closing speeches for the government. Government claims that only those able to afford it will be required to pay the higher charge were disputed by opposition MPs. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, described the 13 per cent increase - eight times the headline rate of inflation - as 'shameful and disgraceful'. He called on the government to widen the categories exempt from prescription charges. Dr Mawhinney said the increase in the prescription charges - about 10 per cent in real terms - would raise about Pounds 278m a year for the National Health Service in England. He stressed that 80 per cent of all prescribed items were dispensed free - more than at any time since the charges were reintroduced by the Labour government in 1968. Dr Mawhinney angered Labour MPs by saying Mr Blunkett had shown 'outrage, but no guts' because he had failed to commit a future Labour government to removing the 50p increase. The minister also emphasised that spending on the NHS was at a record, with gross provision in England standing at more than Pounds 30bn in 1993-1994. He said this amounted to an increase of more than 61 per cent in real terms since 1979 when Labour left office, and clearly demonstrated the government's commitment to the NHS.</p>

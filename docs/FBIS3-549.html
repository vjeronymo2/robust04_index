			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The head of state, President Henri Konan Bedie,  received Dr. Jean-Pierre Okias, the personal representative of  President Elhadj Omar Bongo, this morning. He was accompanied  at the audience by Lambert Kouassi Konan, the Ivorian minister  of agriculture. Dr. Okias came to discuss the active  integration of our two economies. Here are more details from  Dr. Okias:    [Begin Okias recording] We had the honor to be received by  President Konan Bedie and we held lengthy discussions. I  delivered a message from his brother and friend Alhadj Omar  Bongo of Gabon. I am not allowed to disclose the exact contents  of this message, but at least one part of the message can be  retained, pertaining to the economic and trade issues contained  in the message. [passage omitted]    Cote d'Ivoire is one of those African countries which has  achieved self-sufficiency in food production. Gabon needs to  have closer ties with Cote d'Ivoire to discover in what sectors  we can develop relations, so that the Gabonese housewife's  shopping bag remains full. [passage omitted]    It is up to us to take advantage of what food already exists  in quality and quantity. Later, we will base our policy on the  Ivorian experience to help us develop our agricultural sector.  As you know, Gabon -- due to its specific climate, its  semi-tropical geography -- has always based its economy on its  industry, land and minerals. With the Ivorian experience, and  the parallels in trade in existing products, we will benefit  from your experience and learn how to sow our own seeds both in  quantity and quality.

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: APH rises 19% to Pounds 2.54m at interim Automotive Precision Holdings, the Tonbridge-based precision engineering company which came to the market in May at 100p, yesterday reported pre-tax profits up 19 per cent at Pounds 2.54m, against Pounds 2.12m, in the six months to June 30. Mr Stefan Petszaft, managing director, said the result was in line with expectations. The shares were unchanged. Turnover at the group, which exports between 90 and 93 per cent of its products, expanded to Pounds 9.51m (Pounds 7.62m) and operating profits emerged at Pounds 2.61m (Pounds 2.14m). Mr Petszaft said there would be some margin slippage from the former high levels. 'We take jobs in . . . and then work away at the cost base.' The parts the group makes are 'difficult to manufacture with tight tolerances and we have to adopt a zero defect philosophy', said Mr Petszaft. However, first deliveries were now going out for five new contracts started in the half. These included Jaguar, Bosch, Nacam and Lucas. In the past 18 months, the group doubled the number of its customers: mostly in the UK and Germany. Mr Petszaft said that the general market had been more buoyant for the past 12 months and that most of the components made by the group - in power steering, air conditioning, fuel injection and electronically controlled diesel engines - could look forward to growth. Earnings per share came out at 4.2p (3.4p) and, as was flagged at the flotation, there will be no dividend.</p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Northrop Ends F-5 Fighter Program: Northrop Corp. has ended its F-5 fighter  program, flying the last three aircraft from Mojave to Singapore. A total of  3,806 aircraft in the series, which included the T-38 Air Force trainer, were  produced since 1964. The longest-running fighter production program in history,  the F-5s were sold to 30 nations, one of every four nations in the free world,  the company said. Northrop had previously marked the end of the F-5's foreign  military sales program about two years ago but then sold several additional  aircraft. It declined to identify Singapore as the customer, saying the  identity was classified by the buying nation.  </P></p>

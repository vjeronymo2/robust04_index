At the 11th session  of the mixed German-Russian commission, Kinkel emphasized the  organizational skills of the Russian Western Group of Forces and  that the remaining 31,436 men would return home by August. A  spokesman also said the problems described by Burlakov relating  to the regional allocation and completion of the soldiers'  accommodation in Russia, which is being financed by the German  government, would in no way delay the withdrawal schedule.</p>

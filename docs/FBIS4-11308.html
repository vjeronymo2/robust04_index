			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 22 Apr (PL) -- During the meeting that began  today in this capital, Cuban emigrants discussed the possibility  of maintaining their national identity despite living abroad and  their interest in participating in the country's future.    Miguel Alfonso, official spokesman of the "The Nation and  the  Emigrants" Conference convened by the Foreign Ministry, said the  first working session of that meeting resulted in a rich  exchange of opinions following the special speech by National  Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon.    The basic proposals of over 200 emigrants attending the  meeting included the need to definitively end the U.S. blockade  against the island, as well as what they called the "legal  limbo" in which some emigrants find themselves regarding  citizenship.    The visitors voiced their concern that the community  residing  abroad could become some sort of hostage in the existing dispute  between Cuba and the United States. They also expressed  interest in the details of measures that may be adopted by the  National Assembly in the next special session.    The legislative body was convened for 1 May, culminating an  analysis of the country's financial situation that extended down  to the rank and file with the holding of the so-called worker's  parliaments held in over 80,000 work centers.    According to Alfonso, another issue about which participants  requested information was the potential for the emergence in  Cuban society of corruption following certain changes made in  light of the country's complex economic situation.    The emigrants expressed their desire to contribute as much  as  possible toward solving transitory economic situations in the  country as well as in developing the democratic system..    Responding to questions from the plenum, Alarcon highlighted  the risks of introducing an element of division in the nation  with the possible introduction of a multiparty system and  stressed his support for the single party system in accordance  with the current situation.    Regarding the issue of citizenship, the conference spokesman  explained that Alarcon briefed participants about the  Complementary Law, currently under review, and its possible  discussion at the Assembly in a relatively short time.    The National Assembly president also offered a broad  explanation about the existing legislation to participate in the  Cuban electoral process, which requires one to live in the  country for the last two years in order to vote, run for office,  or be elected representative.    Alfonso noted the atmosphere of mutual respect at the  meeting  and the interest of emigrants in the future of their country,  which was demonstrated by the participants' words of patriotism.    With the arrival of new guests, the number of participants  rose to 210, 156 of which came from the United States and the  other 54 from other countries.    After the debate, Abel Preto, president of the Union of  Writers and Artists, gave a speech entitled "Culture, Cubanhood,  and Cubanism," which was followed by a question period and an  exchange of opinions.    Tomorrow morning, Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina will  speak  about immigration issues, another interesting topic for Cubans  who live in several nations on different continents.</p>

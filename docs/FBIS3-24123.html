His latest attempts to strengthen the bank's control  of the previous metals market provide unequivocal evidence of  this.    The first step in this direction was the telegram that  was sent to commercial banks yesterday to explain the new  procedure for using the Ministry of Finance's "gold"  certificates. The document, which was compiled by the Central  Bank without the ministry's knowledge, imposes strict limits on  possibilities for the use of the certificates. While the Russian  banks were wondering whether they could trust the Ministry of  Finance's gold at all, the Central Bank quickly put the  finishing touches on its own plan for the development of the  precious metals market. It is designed mainly to show Russian  financiers that Central Bank personnel can handle this market as  well as their colleagues from the Ministry of Finance.    At one of his press conferences in January, the chairman of  the Central Bank reaffirmed his dissatisfaction with the  development of the Russian precious metals market and said that  the Ministry of Finance had been negligent, in particular, in  organizing the campaign for the more widespread use of the  "gold" certificates. As a result, 50 of the 100 tonnes of gold  securing the certificates were sold to the Central Bank, and it  used this gold to pay part of the debt assigned to commercial  banks. After complaining about the insufficient preparations for  the issuance of the certificates, Mr. Gerashchenko suggested  that the Central Bank had its own plan for the establishment of  the gold market in Russia.    For a long time it has been no secret that the country's  current chief banker has had a sincere wish to reorganize the  Russian gold reserve system. When he was still the acting  chairman of the bank, Viktor Gerashchenko repeatedly proposed  that the State Committee on Precious Metals and Precious Stones  be removed from the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance and  that the gold reserve be administered directly by the Central  Bank. There were several arguments in favor of this. The Central  Bank would have gained the ability to heighten the liquidity of  its own assets and regulate the amount of money in circulation  quickly and efficiently by selling gold on the domestic market.  Russian banks would have had an alternative to foreign currency  investments, which are usually used as a hedge against  inflation. This might have strengthened the ruble. At that time,  however, Gerashchenko's opponents--former Minister of Finance  Boris Fedorov and former acting Prime Minister Yegor  Gaydar--informed the Central Bank that the Ministry of Finance  could sell gold itself. The "gold" certificates issued last  September corroborated this.    After the Russian banks had gained access to the "golden  altar" of the finance market, they could conduct a fairly broad  range of operations. In particular, in the event of the resale  of the certificates, the banks could "split" their value,  equivalent to 10 kilograms of gold (just over 203 million rubles  at this time), and thereby attract the attention of less  prosperous investors. According to KOMMERSANT-DAILY sources,  this was the intention of virtually all of the banks that bought  the certificates--the Inter-Economic Savings Bank, the  Industrial Construction Bank, "Menatep," Most-Bank,  "Mytishchinskiy," "Russian Credit," and "Stolichnyy."    The liquidity of the certificates, meanwhile, left much to  be  desired: A decision was made to liquidate them once a year.  Besides this, the banks could not use the purchased gold on the  international market. The recent slight decline in the rating of  the certificates apparently motivated the Central Bank to  promote its own plan for the organization of the precious metals  market (especially in view of the loyalty of Viktor  Chernomyrdin's new cabinet to the head of the Russian bank). The  first step in this direction was the telegram defining the new  procedure for servicing the Ministry of Finance certificates,  which clearly diminished their appeal.    The telegram specifically said that, in the event of the  resale of the certificates, the banks would be allowed to issue  only their own bonds (instead of receipts for a specific share  of the certificate, which had been a common  practice--KOMMERSANT-DAILY). Central Bank staffers explained  that all of the banks operating in the market for shares of  certificates would have to draw up new sales documents. This  would require the payment of the applicable tax (0.5 percent of  the amount issued) and a registration procedure. In addition,  the bonds could be issued only by banks which had been operating  at a profit for the last three years, had no late payments to  the budget or the Central Bank on their record, had complied  with all standards, and had distributed all securities issued to  date. This meant that many of the banks selling the certificates  would have to collect all of the "split gold" and wait until  September for its liquidation.    It is most likely, however, that the banks still have a  chance of using the sold certificates more effectively. This is  suggested by the absence of any mention in the telegram of the  mechanism for the "re-recording" of certificate sales  (KOMMERSANT-DAILY received all of this information in verbal  reports from Central Bank staffers) and by the possible  intervention of the issuing party--the Ministry of Finance--in  this conflict. Finally, the Central Bank, which intends to  publicize its own plan for the organization of the precious  metals market soon, probably will try to reach a compromise with  agents of the Ministry of Finance and it needs the support of  the other banks. Obviously, this will not be that difficult,  because the Central Bank plan appeals more to commercial banks  than the Ministry of Finance's "Statute on Certificates," and  the Central Bank plans to limit the group of banks authorized to  conduct "gold" operations. In this atmosphere of fierce  competition, the contenders are not likely to openly oppose the  Central Bank's attempts to change the rules of play in the  middle of the game.</p>

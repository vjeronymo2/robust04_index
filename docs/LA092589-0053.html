			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIDDEN ANXIETIES;  </P> <P> A MANDATE TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SENDS AN AFFLUENT COMMUNITY INTO AN  UPROAR  </P> <P> Hidden Hills is a community that tries to live by its name. It has just two  entrances, both gated and guarded. Million-dollar houses sit behind spacious  front yards, oak trees and white ranch-style fences.  </P> <P> It is a town without apartments, without condominiums and without, well, poor  people.  </P> <P> But now the city is grappling with a state mandate that it provide low-cost  housing. A proposal before the City Council to annex land outside the gates and  build 46 units of multifamily housing for senior citizens has resulted in a  controversy that has shaken the serene community of 2,000 people west of  Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> Two stormy public meetings have pitted opponents of the plan against the city's  attorney, who supports it. In the second meeting, on Monday, an uncertain City  Council voted unanimously to informally poll residents.  </P> <P> "This is a real sensitive issue for some of us in this community," said  resident Susan Porcaro. "Yes, there is a need for low-income housing. No, we  don't want it on our street. . . . We worked our tails off to have this house."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Incorporated in 1961  </P> <P> Hidden Hills was incorporated in 1961 to retain the area's rural, equestrian  quality and to fight a planned extension of Burbank Boulevard through the  community. Some residents say opposition to the affordable housing plan stems  from residents' desire to keep Hidden Hills an island in a sea of urban growth.  </P> <P> "When there's a suggestion that the city wishes to annex an area that has  higher density, I think there's a reaction," said Paul Gilbert, president of  the town's community association, which owns and maintains the city's roads and  its two gates.  </P> <P> "Low density is the desire, and there's no other innuendo or implication to  flow from that," added Gilbert, who said he has yet to make up his mind on the  issue.  </P> <P> But earlier this summer, an anonymous letter was circulated in town. It said in  part: "Keep in mind, the residents of the low-income housing project would: 1)  Have a right to vote in our city elections, 2) Have a right to be members of  our city commissions . . . 3) Have a right to use all city-owned facilities,  such as the swimming pool, tennis courts, administration building, etc., 4)  And, have their best interests conflict with our best interests. Is this what  we really want for our community???"  </P> <P> City Atty. Wayne K. Lemieux says he finds the controversy hard to understand.  The project would house senior citizens outside the town's gates and would be  shielded from the existing city by a hill. Its residents would use different  access roads, he said. Lemieux called the opposition unreasonable.  </P> <P> "When people are being unreasonable, I look for ulterior motives," Lemieux  said. "I don't know if there are any here."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Senior-Citizen Project  </P> <P> Hidden Hills is considering the senior-citizen housing project because of a  complex set of circumstances that some residents have found difficult to  understand and some city officials have found difficult to explain.  </P> <P> In 1984, the city formed a redevelopment agency to finance a needed  flood-control project without new taxes. Hidden Hills was promptly sued by Los  Angeles County and a private attorney, Murray O. Kane, who contended that the  city was not blighted and thus should not reap the tax benefits of  redevelopment at the expense of county taxpayers.  </P> <P> Last year, the suit with the county was settled, with county officials agreeing  to pay $5.1 million for the drainage project. But Kane contested the  settlement. Under state redevelopment law, a portion of redevelopment money  must be spent on affordable housing, he contended. In May, Los Angeles Superior  Court Judge R. William Schoettler Jr. agreed to dismiss the suit if Hidden  Hills would agree to an affordable housing plan. The City Council consented.  </P> <P> Last year, the wealthy desert city of Indian Wells was involved in a similar  controversy after it launched a redevelopment agency to attract upscale resort  businesses. Confronted with the affordable housing regulations, the city and a  resort developer lobbied Sacramento for an exemption that passed the  Legislature but was vetoed by Gov. George Deukmejian.  </P> <P> Aside from Hidden Hills' settlement in the redevelopment lawsuit, Lemieux cites  state law that requires all cities to provide for affordable housing in their  planning and zoning regulations.  </P> <P> Hidden Hills argued last year to the Southern California Assn. of Governments,  a regional planning agency responsible for enforcing the housing law, that the  city has no more room for affordable housing and that building it would not be  feasible. SCAG rejected the argument.  </P> <P> "What we're doing is identifying what the need is, not how feasible it is,"  said Jim Minuto, manager of SCAG's housing program. "The city, in their housing  element, has to address that need."  </P> <P> The senior project would be built on a small portion of 25 acres that would be  annexed to the city from Los Angeles County. A private developer would build  nine luxury houses on 20 acres and commercial buildings and the project for  senior citizens on the remainder. The land is along Lasher Road between the  city's southern boundary and the Ventura Freeway.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Comply With State Law  </P> <P> Lemieux sees the project as a way to settle the Kane matter and comply with  state law. Not doing anything, he maintains, could subject Hidden Hills to a  lawsuit in which the city could be forced to build housing without any control  over its cost and location.  </P> <P> But at the two public meetings Sept. 7 and Monday, residents expressed  considerable desire to fight the state's affordable housing requirements.  </P> <P> "Do you want to take a chance that you're going to get caught. . . ?" Lemieux  said at the Sept. 7 hearing. He was interrupted by an approving roar.  </P> <P> "We don't want low-cost housing," resident Philip Gardner said. "We don't want  Willie Brown and Jerry Brown controlling our interests."  </P> <P> "People don't want low-income housing right next door," Porcaro said. "We are  not any different from anybody else in any other area who owns a house."  </P> <P> Danny Howard, the Tarzana developer who wants to build the project, disagreed.  </P> <P> "It would be a mistake for the community to try to stick their head in the sand  and say they don't have to comply with laws," Howard said. "They have an  opportunity now to comply with the law in a manner that would have a very  minimal effect on the community."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Surprised by Opposition  </P> <P> The council, however, remains unsure that the answer is so simple. Council  members agreed to the poll after appearing somewhat taken aback by the volume  of opposition that surfaced at the public meetings.  </P> <P> "It is bewildering," Councilwoman Kathleen D. Bartizal said, adding that she is  unsure of whether the opponents are representative of the town's feelings.  </P> <P> The council did not specify when the poll would take place or what question  would be asked.  </P> <P> "That's going to be one hellacious question," Lemieux said. If the choice is  between the council obeying and defying state law, "I'm not going to give them  that choice."  </P> <P> However, Mayor Chris K. Van Peski said, "The City Council will draft the poll  rather than the city attorney."  </P> <P> Van Peski said he is still unsure of the city's legal obligations. He contends  that Hidden Hills already has low-income retired residents who bought their  homes many years ago. Estimating how many would be strictly conjecture, he  said. The town's 1989 estimated median household income is $75,000, according  to the U. S. Census.  </P> <P> The poll has prompted Councilwoman Colleen Hartman to talk of resigning after  19 years. Although Hartman voted to conduct the poll, she said she would resign  if the poll directs the council to defy state law.  </P> <P> "If they're wrong, I don't need to join them," she said.  </P></p>

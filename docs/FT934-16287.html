			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Station plan may affect rail sell-off POTENTIAL railway franchisers yesterday argued that government plans to hive off the majority of British Rail's 2,500 stations could make privatisation commercially unviable. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, announced on Tuesday that he intended to lease the 'vast majority' of stations to the franchised train operators, with only the 13 mainline stations in the UK's biggest cities being offered to independent operators on leases of up to 125 years. But potential bidders and transport analysts expressed doubts that any other stations apart from the 'big 13' would be anything but a lia-bility. Mr Jim Steer of the transport analysts Steer Davies Gleave said that the stations could be a 'huge liability' for the franchisers. 'They would be tempted to run them down,' he said. Mr Brian Kerslake, the group commercial director of West Midlands Travel, said he thought only the large stations would present opportunities for profit. 'The need for the franchisee to take on stations will add another problem,' he said. Mr Philip Snowden, the managing director of Badger Line, in Weston-Super-Mare, said his group would welcome controlling all aspects of passenger services from car parks to ticket sales. 'We would be wary of taking on lots of ramshackle buildings with a view to property speculation - it's not our line of business,' he said. The potential franchisers agreed that the fact that they would be expected to lease stations would require the government to increase levels of public subsidy. It added an extra 'layer of uncertainty' to the process of privatisation which they were anxious for the government to remove. Mr Brian Cox, of Stagecoach, in Perth, is interested in ScotRail, which, under Mr MacGregor's proposals, would be auctioned with 300 stations. He said 'the whole station package has become less attractive'. However, Mr Bob Hill, managing director of the British Rail Property Board, said that the stations offered a 'fabulous opportunity for innovative entrepreneurial people'. He said that the regulator and franchise director would be responsible for ensuring the franchisers maintained a basic level of passenger services.</p>

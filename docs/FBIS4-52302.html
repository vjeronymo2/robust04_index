			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 7 KYODO -- Japan's ambassador to South  Korea met with Korea's foreign minister Saturday [7 May] to try  to defuse some of the outrage over remarks by Japanese Justice  Minister Shigeto Nagano about Japan's role during World War II.    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu in a meeting with Japanese  Ambassador to South Korea Toshio Goto, conveyed to the Japanese  Government the concerns and regrets that Seoul has over Nagano's  remarks, Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said. Goto told  Han that the official position of the Japanese Government will  be taken after Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata returns home Saturday  evening from an overseas trip. The ambassador also said that he  received an instruction from the Japanese Government to convey  to Seoul that Japan takes the official stance that South Korea  and Japan must build future-oriented relations while looking  squarely at the past.    Han, in responding to the ambassador's remarks, said that  Japan should take proper action to prevent any recurrence of the  matter and heal the wounds of the past, adding, "South Koreans  got hurt seriously and expressed indignation over the remarks."  On Friday, Han summoned the ambassador to the Foreign Ministry  and expressed "shock" and deep regrets over Nagano's remarks,  demanding that Japan clarify the remarks and present a clear  position.    In Tokyo, the Japanese justice minister offered Saturday to  resign after setting off a flurry of international condemnation  with his remarks that Japan was not an aggressor during World  War II and the 1937 Nanjing Massacre was a fabrication.    Following the invasion of the then Chinese capital of  Nanjing  in December 1937, Imperial Japanese Army troops slaughtered more  than 300,000 Chinese civilians, according to Chinese estimates.  Japanese historians, however, tend to cite lower estimates.  According to estimates given at the war crimes tribunal in  Tokyo, about 42,000 civilians were killed in Nanjing and more  than 100,000 civilians and prisoners of war were killed in the  vicinity over the following six weeks.    Also on Friday, South Korea lodged a strong protest with  Japan over Nagano's separate remark terming "comfort women" as  licensed prostitutes. Yu Byung-woo, director general of the  Foreign Ministry's Asian Affairs Bureau, summoned Japanese  Embassy official Hiroshi Shigeta on Friday and expressed deep  regrets over Nagano's remarks on the "comfort women," whom the  Japanese military took to front line brothels during World War  II, spokesman Chang said.    Nagano made the remarks in an interview with KYODO NEWS  SERVICE on Tuesday. Historians estimate that as many as 200,000  women, most of them from the Korean Peninsula, were taken to  wartime brothels to provide sex as "comfort women," as they were  euphemistically called, for Japanese soldiers.</p>

In a statement to the U.S. Embassy, the Russian Foreign  Ministry accused Morris, who works as a counselor at the U.S.  Embassy in Moscow, of engaging in activities incompatible with  his diplomatic status, noting him as an agent of the U.S.  Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).    "The Russian Foreign Ministry is lodging a protest against  illegal activities of the American side with regard to an  official representative of the Russian Foreign Intelligence  Service who has been working in Washington since the summer of  1993 by mutual consent," the statement said.    "In this situation," the statement continued, "we have to  declare, on the basis of reciprocity, a CIA officer in Moscow  persona non grata and demand that he leave the Russian  Federation."    It also said that "The Russian Foreign Ministry proceeds  from  the fact that there are special channels for settling issues  arising on both sides in connection with intelligence or  counterintelligence activity. The channels can and should be  engaged. This will allow (us) to find a mutually acceptable way  out from the current situation and avoid its politicization."    On Friday [25 February], the United States declared Russian  diplomat Aleksandr Lysenko persona non grata and ordered him to  leave the country within seven days.</p>

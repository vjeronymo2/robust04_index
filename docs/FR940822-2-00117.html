Recipients also must submit to the Institute a certificate of attendance at the program and an evaluation of the educational program they attended. A copy of the evaluation also must be sent to the Chief Justice of their State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A State or a local jurisdiction may impose additional requirements on scholarship recipients that are consistent with SJI's criteria and requirements, e.g., a requirement to serve as faculty on the subject at a State- or locally-sponsored judicial education program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Dispute Resolution and the Courts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This category includes research, evaluation, and demonstration projects addressing the findings and recommendations developed at the National Symposium on Court-Connected Dispute Resolution Research, conducted in Orlando in October 1993. The Institute is interested in projects that enhance the courts' ability to compare findings among research studies; address the nature and operation of ADR programs within the context of the court system as a whole; compare dispute resolution processes to attorney settlement as well as trial; and promote the ability of the courts to move toward on-going self-evaluation of court-connected dispute resolution programs. Among the topics of greatest interest are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. The Structure of Court-Connected Dispute Resolution Programs including such issues as the appropriate timing for referrals to dispute resolution services and the effects implementing such referrals at various stages during litigation; the effect of different referral methods including any differences in outcome between voluntary and mandatory referrals; cultural issues, including the nature of cultural conflict and its effect on outcomes; and approaches that provide rural courts and other under-served areas with adequate court-connected dispute resolution services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. The Selection, Qualifications and Training of Court-Connected Neutrals including what selection procedures are most effective; what standards should be used to qualify a neutral; what constitutes effective dispute resolution training; on what basis and when people should be eliminated from the training process; how courts can maintain and improve neutrals' skills; and how ineffective neutrals should be removed from the pool.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iii. Innovative uses of court-connected dispute resolution for resolving complex cases including land-use litigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

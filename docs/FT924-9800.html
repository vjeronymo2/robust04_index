			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Panic survives no-confidence vote YUGOSLAVIA'S prime minister, Mr Milan Panic, yesterday narrowly survived a no-confidence vote in the upper house of the federal parliament. The attempt by followers of President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to oust Mr Panic failed after the vote of 18 to 17 in the 42-member house, which is divided between deputies from Serbia and Montenegro. Montenegro, the other member of the reconstituted Yugoslav federation, has supported Mr Panic and Mr Dobrica Cosic, the president of Yugoslavia. Since nominating Mr Panic as prime minister in June, Mr Milosevic has orchestrated a campaign to oust him. Mr Panic and Mr Cosic have pledged to democratise Serbia and stop the war in Bosnia. They have also called on the Serbian president to resign. Mr Panic lost a no-confidence motion in the lower house of parliament on Monday. The lower house is dominated by Serbia's ruling Socialists and their ultra-nationalist allies, who accused the federal leaders of treachery and serving foreign interests. Mr Panic survived another no-confidence vote in September. Meanwhile, the future of the Bosnian peace negotiations in Geneva remained uncertain following Monday's decision by the 'parliament' of the self-declared Serbian Republic of Bosnia to withdraw from the talks unless the republic was formally recognised by the international mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen. Diplomats said they did not expect a unilateral Serb walk-out from the negotiations. They noted the parliament's decision said constitutional proposals made by the international mediators for a decentralised state with 7-10 autonomous regions were unaccept-able as 'the sole basis' of negotiation. Mr Nikola Koljevic, head of the Bosnian Serb delegation in Geneva, yesterday handed Mr Vance a copy of the decision, and Mr Vance was due to see the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, last night. Elsewhere, Croatia yesterday refused to grant sanctuary to thousands of refugees fleeing Jajce, a town in central Bosnia seized by Serb forces on Friday. Croatia is already sheltering over 600,000 refugees.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Honduran economic developments monitored through 7  June.    Finance Minister Juan Ferrera has announced that to fulfill  the international financial organizations' requirement to reduce  the fiscal deficit from 11 percent to 5 percent, the government  still needs to make an adjustment of some 1.5 billion lempiras.  Meanwhile, Minister Ferrera explained that the Honduran  Government will not eliminate subsidies on transportation or on  the price of kerosene. (Tegucigalpa EL PERIODICO DE HONDURAS in  Spanish 31 May 94 p 11)    The government collected 1 billion lempiras in taxes in the  first five months of the year, according to Deputy Finance  Minister Ramiro Lozano Landa. He added that tax revenues were  300 million lempiras higher than in the same period in 1993.  Nevertheless, Lozano Landa pointed out that the increased  revenues still need to be accompanied by a 10 percent reduction  in government spending, as recently noted by Hugo Neo Pino,  president of the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH). (San Pedro Sula  TIEMPO in Spanish 1 Jun 94 p 6)    According to a report issued by the Economic Studies  Department of the BCH, inflation reached 12.7 percent in the  first five months of the year. The BCH report added that, if  the growth rate continues at its current pace, the government  will not be able to meet its goal of an 18-percent rate of  inflation by the end of 1994.

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Inflation figures ease D-Mark THE D-MARK eased against the US dollar and European currencies yesterday after good wholesale prices figures in Germany suggested that inflationary pressures there may have abated, writes James Blitz. After significantly strengthening against all currencies on Thursday, the D-Mark closed one pfennig softer against the US dollar at DM1.4690. However, analysts said that this may be only a temporary respite, and that traders could try and test the dollar's lows again next week. A better-than expected set of German wholesale prices for July suggested that inflationary pressures there have eased, and reduced dealers' fears of another Lombard rate rise. Wholesale prices plunged 1.3 per cent from the previous month and was down 0.9 per cent from a year earlier - the first year-on year decline since 1990. Some currency dealers interpreted the figures as one of the most promising signs yet that the Bundesbank will not need to raise its interest rates again. One analyst suggested that the dip in inflation will force the Bundesbank to abandon M3 money supply as the gauge by which it fixes interest rates, in the same way that the British government did in the mid-1980s. However, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank Vice-President, softened the impact of the figures in a German TV interview by suggesting that they did not signify a fall in indigenous German inflation. "It is partly the result of import prices and exchange rates," he said. The forex market will also have to wait for the publication of the M3 money supply figure for July, due on Wednesday, before it can interpret the Bundesbank's next move. Sterling's recent fall against the D-Mark was slowed by the German inflation figures, although Britain's own figure for headline inflation in July, down 0.2 percentage points from the previous month, had little impact. The pound closed at DM2.8150 from a previous close of DM2.8170. Analysts say that sterling's immediate fate will be decided by two factors: the strength of the dollar and next Wednesday's figure for Second Quarter GDP, which is expected to be poor. Pressure grows on the Bank of England to support the currency in the open market. The lira remained weak against the D-Mark, as dealers continued to be swayed by Moody's two-notch downgrading of Italy's foreign currency debt on Thursday. There was no change in Italian interest rates yesterday, although dealers continue to feel that the Bank of Italy's recent cut in its discount rate was premature. The lira closed down at L759.9 from a previous finish of L759.3. The French franc finished up against the D-Mark at FFr3.389 from FFr3.392.</p>

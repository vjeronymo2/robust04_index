			<p>BFN     [Text] The user trials of surface-to-surface medium-range  missile Prithvi [Earth] got under way today with the successful  launching of the missile. According to Defense Ministry  sources, the test launch fully met the requirements. Army  authorities are conducting the trials in actual user  configuration at the Chandipur interim test range near Balasore  in Orissa. According to agencies, the first launch has been  targeted to hit the Wheeler Islands located in the Bay of  Bengal. The next phase of trial of the 150-to- 250-km-range  missile will be test-fired in actual battlefield conditions.  The missile will be targeted against built-up targets to test  its accuracy and the impact of conventional weapons. The trials  are to last for over two months before the missile is declared  fit for induction into the army.    The trials were postponed last month as the prime minister  was visiting the United States.    [Hong Kong AFP in English at 0733 GMT on 4 Jun 94 in a  similar report adds: "PTI said the Prithvi (Earth) missile was  fired in clear weather from a mobile launcher at the  Chandipur-on-Sea test range in the eastern coastal state of  Orissa.

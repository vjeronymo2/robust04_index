			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MESA TO SELL ASSETS, CUT DEBT ALMOST 30%  </P> <P> Mesa Limited Partnership agreed to sell a portion of its portfolio to Seagull  Energy Corp. in a deal that could reach nearly $500 million and cut debts of T.  Boone Pickens Jr.'s Mesa by nearly one-third, it was announced Wednesday.  </P> <P> Under terms outlined in a letter of intent, Houston-based Seagull will pay $376  million in cash for the properties, reserves and acreage and assume $50 million  in liabilities.  </P> <P> Mesa also would receive up to an additional $50 million in 1994, based on the  weighted average price of natural gas sold from the properties between 1991 and  1993.  </P> <P> The deal covers about 15% of the oil and gas company controlled by Pickens. It  is subject to approval by Seagull's board and is expected to close in December.  </P> <P> "It effectively reduces Mesa's reserves by only 15% yet allows us to reduce our  net debt by nearly 30%," said Mesa spokesman Jay Rosser.  </P> <P> Mesa's current debt of $1.4 billion would be cut to about $1 billion if the  deal is successful, he said.  </P> <P> The assets to be purchased include Mesa's Mid-Continent, Rocky Mountain and  Gulf Coast offshore properties and operations.  </P> <P> "These properties will greatly diversify our total reserve portfolio, give us  significant reserve positions and exploratory prospects in geographic areas  other than our historic Gulf Coast area of emphasis, and extend the average  reserve life of our company's reserves," said Seagull Chairman Barry J. Galt.  </P> <P> Seagull spokesman Alan Payne said the deal would increase the company's assets  from $391 million as of June 30 to $751 million.  </P> <P> Pickens said the sale would help Mesa increase "our concentration of  high-quality, long-life properties," strengthen the company's balance sheet  and, "through the gas price participation, (retain) a meaningful interest in  the upside on the properties being sold."  </P> <P> Mesa has total assets of $2.6 billion.  </P></p>

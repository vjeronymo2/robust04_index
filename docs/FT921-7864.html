			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (5): Wide choice of cars for employees - Profile of Johnson Matthey JOHNSON MATTHEY offers its employees a very wide range of company cars from which to choose. Even the most junior employee entitled to a company car has a choice from about 75 models from nine manufacturers. But, as might be expected from the world's largest platinum group metals marketing organisation, the company stipulates that every car must be fitted with an anti-pollution catalyst. Automotive catalysts are now the biggest consumers of platinum metals and JM, which is one of the largest catalyst producers, has many of the world's motor companies among its customers. So virtually every car manufacturer offering cars with catalysts in the UK is on JM's list of approved vehicles. This list was extended two years ago and other changes made to ensure more employees received cars of their choice. JM allocates cars on an hierarchical basis but has blurred the lines between categories by permitting employees to contribute some of their own cash towards company cars. An employee can add up to an extra 10 per cent to the monthly cost to get a better car. Employees pay the extra by way of a 'private use' charge. Mr Terry Stock, JM's group personnel controller, says: 'Providing cars is an expensive benefit - we spend about Pounds 2m a year - yet two years ago people were complaining because they could not have the cars they wanted. It made sense to change the system slightly so that, at no extra cost, they could have the cars they wanted.' However, like many other companies, JM frequently reviews its company car operations and Mr Stock says there is no guarantee the system would not be changed if there were substantial savings from having a less-flexible approach. Already the impact of the recession has forced a change of policy and JM's cars are now increasingly being retained for four years or 60,000 miles instead of the three years or 60,000 which was the norm until recently. 'Modern cars can run for 80,000 miles with no trouble,' Mr Stock explains, 'but keeping a car for four years is stretching it a bit when it comes to employee satisfaction.' So, would JM switch back to a three-year policy when the economy picks up? 'I would not expect an immediate return,' he says. 'But the change will probably be market-driven. When other companies move back to three years, we may have to follow.' Mr Stock says the Chancellor's introduction of National Insurance charges on the assumed financial benefit of company cars means JM will hold as firmly as possible to the present 'benchmark' costs. So, when car prices go up, employees might find the vehicle of their choice has moved into a higher category. The successively fierce increases in the personal tax charged on company car benefits have caused some JM employees to ask for the benefit to be provided by some other means. Typically these are employees whose spouses also have company cars and who do not want to pay the tax on both. Mr Stock says that requests for a change in the benefit are dealt with on an individual basis. JM once bought all its company cars for cash. However, in 1984 it completed a sale-and-leaseback arrangement with Avis and in August of that year signed a contract hire deal with that company. In the intervening years Avis has had several changes of management and even an ownership change. There have also been times when its performance slipped below what JM considered was the minimum level. So there have been occasions when competing companies were asked to quote and individual operating units within JM considered moving away from Avis. But Avis Lease and Fleet Management still has the contract - a full-service agreement covering all JM's 378 cars. Mr Stock says: 'I suppose it is a question of 'better the devil you know'. But Avis understands us and has worked with us and has responded well to criticism in the past.' He says JM tries to have as little as possible internal involvement with operating the car fleet. Nevertheless, he spends some of his time at group headquarters setting policy - which must be agreed by JM's chief executive's committee - while each operating unit has a fleet manager to provide liaison between employees and Avis. Employees are expected to look after their company cars and there have been cases where people have been disciplined for failing to do so. When employees have what Mr Stock calls 'driving problems', they are sent for special driving tuition offered as part of the Avis package. There is an unwritten rule at JM that employees cannot choose sports cars or off-road vehicles unless they can make out a very good case for having them. Mr Stock says nobody at JM has complete freedom of choice of car. The remuneration committee of the board has to approve vehicles used by the company's senior management. A few big executive cars are bought outright by the company, 'although we're looking at leasing now'. At the other end of the scale, the 'benchmark' car costs JM Pounds 327.66 a month. It is a Vauxhall Cavalier, four-door 1.8 litre - with a catalyst, of course.</p>

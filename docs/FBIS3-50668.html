In a news conference, Cristiani declared: "I am convinced  that nobody in his right mind could guarantee that the FMLN  (Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front) has destroyed all of  its weapons, because we all know this is not true."    Additionally, Cristiani revealed that the government has  thousands of documents linking the FMLN to the assassination of  rightist leaders and ideologists during the past decade, the  responsibility of which was later denied by the former  guerrillas. According to Cristiani, Presidency Minister Antonio  Rodriguez Porth appeared to be one of those victims. He was  killed nine days after the current government took office in  June of 1989.    The Salvadoran president also stated that the UN Observers  for El Salvador (Onusal) were kept informed of the existence of  weapons and groups of former guerrillas who are still armed.    "They have had weapons in Nicaragua, and they have weapons  in  our country," insisted Cristiani, who did not give details on  the alleged weapons still in the hands of former rebels.    In August of 1993, Onusal issued a communique proclaiming  the  total destruction of the FMLN arsenals, although it warned that  there was a very good chance that weapons could turn up in the  future in isolated cases.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (19): Less work to cut the grass - Local government application / Horsham can pass on some of the benefits of its GIS to its contractors when they tender Like many local councils, the need to manage housing and developments triggered the development of a GIS at Horsham District Council, writes Claire Gooding. Horsham covers a community of 110,000 inhabitants in 200 square miles in West Sussex. 'Because of the extent of data, we looked at GIS as a tool we could use to act as a link between departmental systems, and provide a common say of access method to look at spatial development,' explains Robert Pope, Horsham's IT manager. 'Typically, what we needed to do was to bring up a map, and look at such factors as planning applications and how they affect a particular plot of land.' Horsham District Council's interest in GIS as a way of handling spatial information originated with the Cholsey Report in the 1980s. In 1989 it looked at several options - from McDonnell Douglas, IBM, ICL, and Siemens. Flexibility was vital; one of the main considerations was that the system had to be able to access data held on the BS2000 mainframe, and connect with textual data held on an IBM AS400. In 1991, in the first phase of a project worth over Pounds 1m, Siemens Plessey developed a blueprint for the council's IT strategy, using a corporate data model based on analysis of the work-patterns and information flow between the council's 700 or so employees. Next came the implementation (managed by Siemens Nixdorf) of SICAD on the BS2000 mainframe, networked with four Unix and three PC workstations in the council's planning department. The basis of the information included 700 OS maps covering the area, and postcode grid-reference files from Pinpoint. Now 130,000 planning records, dating back as far as 1948, have been captured on to the system, and each property in the area has been assigned a unique property reference number, used as a reference by all departments. Horsham believes it is the first local authority to have established a corporate property database of this sort. There can be as many as 32 different constraints on a planning application: for example, the land might be designated an SSSI - site of special scientific interest. 'It used to take days to collate the information needed for one planning application from index cards, various maps and other sources.' The system went live this November. According to Mr Pope, it promises dramatic improvements in the service to the public. 'We can now turn round land searches within an hour,' he says. Other applications under way are a 'land terrier,' (asset register), a charges system for land searches. Other future uses may include a register of contaminated land. One of the most ingenious uses for the system is the management of compulsory competitive tenders in such areas a grounds maintenance. There might be as many as 500 sites covered in one estimate for grass-cutting. From the beginning of 1994, those submitting tenders will be helped by digitised maps of the areas for grass-cutting. 'If prospective contractors get proper information, we will get a more realistic price,' concludes Mr Pope.</p>

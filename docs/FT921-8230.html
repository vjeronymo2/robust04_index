			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / German economy warning THE slowdown in the German economy is either a pause for breath or the start of a lasting recession. The economics ministry issued the grim warning yesterday as it highlighted two decisive factors which could push the economy into a long downturn: a continuation of last year's high wage increases and collapse of the negotiations on the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The ministry's latest monthly report was released at the same time as statistics for the past year's wages, prices and external trade. They show largely negative trends on all fronts for 1991 as a whole. Page 3</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tory rebels vow to carry on campaign YESTERDAY'S defeat was a bitter pill for the Tory rebels to swallow. But there is plenty of fight left in their camp. Their intention is clearly to battle through the remaining stages of the Maastricht Bill with all the strength and guile they can muster. 'There certainly will be the use of every tactic that is appropriate,' one of the rebel leaders said yesterday. The rebels will find it difficult to derail the treaty's progress towards ratification - their ideal objective. But they may well delay it significantly, which for them is the next best thing. To force the one change in the treaty's text that could prove fatal, arithmetic suggests they would need to find common ground with Labour in voting for an amendment to the implementing bill. This will not be easy. Mr Michael Spicer, one of the rebel leaders, said yesterday: 'We have got nothing in common with Labour generally. There is no way we would co-operate on the sorts of things they want.' To delay the bill's passage, however, they would merely have to help ensure that the government did not obtain a guillotine or a series of closure motions restricting the time for debate. Although the bill itself stretches to just three clauses and less than one side of an A4 sheet of paper, Tory rebels and other MPs have already tabled sufficient amendments and suggested new clauses to fill a densely packed 65-page document. To debate all these proposals in full could take years. The indication yesterday that the government was prepared to delay the bill's third reading until after a second Danish referendum suggests, however, that the government would like to see the committee stage finished by May. Such a deadline might trigger an old-fashioned war of attrition, involving a long sequence of late-night sittings with MPs on call at virtually any hour in case a division was called. In this situation, the rebels would probably dig in their heels and seek to delay the government for as long as possible. As they did so, they would be encouraged by the hope that the Danes might achieve their most cherished objective for them by rejecting the treaty for a second time. This would, of course, enable them to claim victory and to argue that the government was wrong to waste valuable Commons time debating a document that was destined not to be ratified. In terms of finding common ground with Labour in a bid to force changes to the bill at the committee stage, rebels suggest that the best bet could be an amendment urging the government to hold a British referendum. This could attract support from a significantly larger number of Tories than those who opposed the government on Wednesday night. It would also be backed by a sizeable contingent of Labour anti-Maastrichteers. However, it is unlikely to be backed by the Labour leadership. Even winning the battle to have an amendment carried would not amount to a decisive victory in the campaign. The government could succeed in reversing the change at the bill's report stage.</p>

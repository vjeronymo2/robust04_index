			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] During its regular weekly meeting held today,  Romania's Government adopted the following statement on NATO's  Partnership for Peace proposal.    The statement made by Romania's President on 11 January 1994  -- a statement that was released immediately after the  conclusion of the Brussels summit of the North Atlantic Council  -- represents the official acceptance by our country of the  Partnership for Peace, as a new form of cooperation between NATO  and the democratic countries situated to the east of Alliance,  designed to lead to consolidating security and stability in  Europe.    Romania's Government notes with full satisfaction and  accepts  the invitation addressed by the North Atlantic Council to the  interested states, including our country, to participate in the  Partnership for Peace, considering it as a preliminary stage for  Romania's eventual admission to NATO as a fully fledged member.  Romania's Government declares that it is ready to sign the  basic document on the participation to a new form of partnership  as soon as possible, and asks the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to  take urgent steps in this direction. At the same time, the  government has asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the  Ministry of National Defense to work out a draft document on  Romania's participation, which will identify the measures that  our country intends to adopt in order to implement the political  goals of the Partnership for Peace and will specify the military  and other means that our country might use for activities within  the Partnership for Peace framework, after consultations with  the specialized commissions of the two chambers of Romania's  Parliament.    The government will submit the draft document to the  approval  of the Supreme Council for the Country's Defense. On the basis  of this document and of a partnership program to be worked out  by NATO, the sides will proceed to negotiating and signing the  individual Partnership for Peace program between Romania and  NATO, which will be submitted for ratification to the country's  Parliament, in accordance with constitutional provisions.  Likewise, proceeding from the provisions of the invitation to  participate in the Partnership for Peace, the government asked  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of National  Defense to appoint their civilian and military representatives  to the Alliance's headquarters in Brussels and to the  coordinating cell of the Partnership for Peace at SHAPE [Supreme  Headquarters of Allied Powers Europe] in Mons, Belgium.    Romania's Government believes that the provisions of the  basic document on consultations with NATO in the event of a  direct threat to the partner states as well as the provisions of  the Declaration of Principles adopted by the North Atlantic  Council in Brussels on 11 January 1994 unequivocally take into  consideration Romania's vital security interests. At the same  time, the government considers our country's participation in  the Partnership for Peace an essential component of the global  process of Romania's integration into the Euro-Atlantic  structures, a key goal of Romanian foreign policy. The  government particularly values the national consensus that has  emerged among the parliamentary political forces on the issue of  accepting the invitation for Romania's participation in the  Partnership for Peace -- the Romanian Government's statement  reads in conclusion.</p>

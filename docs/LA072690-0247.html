			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CLOSED-DOOR TALKS ON HIALEAH'S FUTURE  </P> <P> Representatives of the Miami area's three race tracks met privately Wednesday  to determine the fate of Hialeah Park.  </P> <P> Gulfstream and Calder, both owned by Bertram Firestone, are in position to  squeeze Hialeah out of the South Florida scheme since racing dates are now  unregulated in Florida.  </P> <P> That was evident last season, when Hialeah was forced to close when unable to  carry out its meeting in competition with Calder and Gulfstream, which control  the market.  </P> <P> Many prominent horsemen support an effort to save Hialeah, however, even though  its owner, John J. Brunetti, still makes demands for a lengthy, unopposed  winter meeting. He is unlikely to be granted such a request.  </P> <P> "I will have no comment, and it is my understanding that no one who attended  will have one either," Gulfstream President Doug Donn said after the meeting.  Neither Firestone nor Brunetti attended.  </P> <P> The tracks have until Tuesday to arrive at dates for next year's schedule or  elect, by not doing so, to oppose one another again. It is doubtful Hialeah  would attempt to open again under such circumstances.  </P></p>

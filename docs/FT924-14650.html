			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Wide backing forfoes of Canada's new constitution OPPONENTS of Canada's proposed new constitution have opened a wide lead in several key provinces, less than three weeks before a national referendum on the constitutional package. A Gallup poll published yesterday showed the No side backed by 53 per cent of decided voters in British Columbia, 51 per cent in the three prairie provinces and 46 per cent in Quebec. Support for the deal in these regions is estimated at 30-36 per cent. Doubts about the outcome of the October 26 referendum have already lifted domestic interest rates and elicited warnings of further economic turbulence. Mr Ted Newall, chief executive of Nova Corporation of Alberta, one of the country's biggest energy and pipeline companies, warned on Tuesday night that a No vote would mean, at best, five to 15 years of economic and political uncertainty. The constitutional package - the Charlottetown Agreement - is backed by all three national parties, the leaders of all 10 provinces and the bulk of Canada's business community. They have been put on the defensive, however, by having to acknowledge that the agreement is a compromise which gives no region or interest group everything it wants. Its critics - the most vociferous of whom include Quebec separatists, western Canadian regional groups and women activists - have had the advantage of highlighting the agreement's weaknesses. The Yes side, which was slow to put its campaign into gear, expects to make up ground over the next few weeks. It is taking comfort from the big proportions of undecided voters - 22 per cent in Quebec and 17 per cent in British Columbia.</p>

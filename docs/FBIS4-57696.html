			<p>BFN     [Text] This trade embargo does not apply to food and  medicines. It went into effect against Haiti on the night of 21  May at 2359, that is, 0359 GMT on 22 May, following this  country's military refusal to resign. Total calm reigns in the  Haitian capital.    I am a hostage of the situation and I am organizing myself  to  survive, a small shopkeeper said in summing up the reactions  observed a short time before the embargo went into effect.    The Port-au-Prince harbor worked until the last minute,  unloading the hundreds of containers bringing, from everywhere,  goods ordered from abroad intended to last for several months.  The fuel-smuggling at the Haitian-Dominican border continued  like in preceding days, done to survive by a destitute peasantry  scurrying like ants, using empty plastic one-gallon containers  once used to hold cooking oil.    On 21 May, the government of provisional President Emile  Jonassaint, which is not recognized by the international  community, announced a special committee had been created to  manage the sanctions.    In point of fact, we are unfortunately accustomed to this  tragic status quo. Therefore, [words indistinct] the owner of a  small working-class restaurant comments with resignation, who  like the man-in-the-street is convinced it is the poorest who  will suffer the most, as usual.    On the economic plane, it is the latest jobs in the  subcontracting companies -- 8,000 to 10,000 according to the  U.S. Embassy; 6,000 to 8,000 according to employers' sources --  that will disappear following this embargo. But the peasantry is  going to be hit very hard by the halt in coffee and cocoa  exports, the nation's second most important export activity  after the subcontractors which brings in about $15 million at a  time when international prices have risen. The OAS trade embargo  instituted in October 1991 and intensified by a UN oil embargo  in 1993 has already cost the nation 200,000 jobs. The  unemployment rate in Haiti exceeds 60 percent. Decided by a 6  May vote of the UN Security Council, the total embargo aims to  drive the military out of power and bring back President  Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was overthrown on 30 September 1991.  Aristide is now living in exile in Washington.</p>

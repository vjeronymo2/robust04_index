			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To bring about this reduction in failure rate, RSPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) (Docket PS&hyph;121; 56 FR 23538, May 22, 1991) on testing older pipelines. The notice proposed to extend the part 195 requirement for a proven margin of safety to all pipelines that are covered by part 195 but excepted from the testing standards in subpart E of part 195. These pipelines are (1) hazardous liquid steel interstate pipelines constructed before January 8, 1971, other than onshore HVL pipelines; (2) hazardous liquid steel interstate offshore gathering lines constructed before August 1, 1977; (3) hazardous liquid steel intrastate pipelines constructed before October 21, 1985, other than onshore HVL pipelines; and (4) carbon dioxide steel pipelines constructed before July 12, 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the NPRM, RSPA also discussed the unique safety problems with longitudinal seams on ERW pipe manufactured before 1970. RSPA proposed that operators give pipelines with a predominance of pre-1970 ERW pipe priority in scheduling tests. Under this proposal, testing of pipelines known to have more than 50 percent (by mileage) of pre-1970 ERW pipe would have to be completed within 4.5 years after a final rule is published.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thirteen persons submitted written comments on the NPRM: 11 pipeline operators, the American Petroleum Institute (API), and the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI). A discussion of the significant comments and their disposition in development of the final rules follows.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> General Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most commenters discussed specific problems they anticipated in carrying out the rulemaking proposals, without objecting to them outright. DOI favored adoption of the proposals, especially for offshore pipelines. One commenter, a major operator of hazardous liquid pipelines, clearly supported the proposed rules. A few other operators hedged their apparent agreement with the proposals by suggesting RSPA allow smart pigs as a substitute for pressure testing or MOP reduction, an issue discussed separately below. Another operator asserted that RSPA should require pressure testing or MOP reduction only where risk is heightened by factors such as adverse leak or corrosion history, environmental sensitivity, or high population. Only two operators strongly objected to the proposals. But, they aimed their remarks at carbon dioxide pipelines, and as discussed below, the final rule addresses their concerns. By and large, RSPA believes the commenters supported the objective of the notice concerning older untested or inadequately tested hazardous liquid pipelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Limiting the application of the proposed rules to older pipelines that have an increased risk of failure or that are near environmentally sensitive areas or a large number of people does not sufficiently address safety concerns. The problem of the growth of defects is common among all pipelines regulated by part 195. It is not limited to pipelines that are in a worrisome condition or a high risk location. For such problems, RSPA believes that all pipelines should provide a basic level of protection. The proposals in the NPRM were consistent with this view. They would assure that older pipelines provide at least the same basic level of protection against the growth of defects as newer pipelines must provide. Also, limiting the proposed rules to pipelines that involve some added element of risk would leave many miles of older pipelines without adequate protection against failures caused by the growth of defects. RSPA strongly believes these potential failures and preventable damages should not go unchecked.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Pump Stations and Tank Farms <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> API and two operators argued that the proposed rules should not apply to pump stations, tank farms, or tank farm delivery facilities. They said compliance would be an extremely time-consuming task because of the many fittings, valves, tanks, and instrumentation. API also suggested the benefits would be questionable since most accidents, as described in the NPRM, occur on pipeline rights-of-way.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 195 has limited application at tank farms. In general, it applies to only receiving and reinjection lines, to tanks used as breakout tanks, and to facilities associated with breakout tanks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

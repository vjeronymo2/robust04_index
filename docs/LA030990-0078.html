			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S OFFICIAL: KOVIC WON'T RUN FOR CONGRESS  </P> <P> Ron Kovic officially declared Thursday that he has decided against seeking the  Democratic nomination to challenge Rep. Robert K. Dornan, (R-Garden Grove).  </P> <P> A statement released by Kovic, the wounded Vietnam veteran whose life story is  told in the movie "Born on the Fourth of July," gave no reason for bowing out.  </P> <P> The statement said: "After much careful thought and consideration, I have  decided not to run. I love this country very much, so I will continue to speak  out and support political candidates and issues which articulate the vision of  a new, even better America and a more peaceful world."  </P> <P> The prospect of Kovic, who became a leading anti-war activist after he returned  from Vietnam, challenging Dornan, a conservative known for his colorful  rhetoric, had attracted nationwide interest.  </P> <P> But on Tuesday, Kovic told associates he had decided not to run. At the time,  however, Kovic refused to confirm that for reporters.  </P></p>

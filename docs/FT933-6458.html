			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Observer: Pool tax As any white South African will tell you, having your own swimming pool is more trouble than it's worth. Pool-owners spend hours fiddling with chemical testing kits, 'backwashing' the filter system, and dumping in alternate amounts of chlorine and acid. Now, as though life were not tough enough already, an official of the Cosatu union, the ANC's closest ally, has said a future government would tax swimming pools. One caller to a Johannesburg radio station yesterday said it was the last straw; he had decided to emigrate. Given that a senior ANC official recently promised to confiscate half of every South African's assets as a sort of guilt tax for apartheid, it is probably not worth worrying about a pool tax. It will be far easier to fill in the wretched hole than persuade the exchange control authorities to let you send half your capital abroad.</p>

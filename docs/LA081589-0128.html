			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> THIRD OF JOBLESS SAID TO GET BENEFITS  </P> <P> Fewer than one in three jobless workers received unemployment insurance in an  average month last year, tying the lowest rate ever recorded, a private  research group said today.  </P> <P> The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which calculated the  figures from Labor Department data, called the low extent of coverage an  ominous indicator of what might happen if the economy weakens further.  </P> <P> Of the 6.7 million workers unemployed in an average month in 1988, only 2.1  million of them -- 31.5% -- were getting benefits, the center said. That was  the same percentage as in 1987 and the sixth straight year that the proportion  receiving assistance has not improved.  </P></p>

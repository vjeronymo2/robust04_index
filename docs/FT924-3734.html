			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family: Easing yourself little by little into retirement - Planning your Pension STAGGERED vesting is one of the pensions industry's least appealing items of jargon, summoning images of an athlete's desperate lunge at the finish line. In fact, it could offer those with personal pension funds a way to wrest from the life offices some limited control over their retirement income. If it can be done without too many administration costs, it could be the best way for many to take their pension. Vesting refers to taking the pension fund which has accrued for you and converting it into an annuity (where a life company undertakes to pay you a fixed annual sum until your death, whenever it occurs), plus a cash sum. Previous practice has been to do this all at once at the state retirement age (60 for women and 65 for men). However, there is no legal requirement for this. Since the introduction of personal pensions, the age range over which a pension fund can be converted into income is from 50 to 75. The bulk of the fund must be used to buy an annuity, but you also receive a sum of tax-free cash. For old-style retirement annuity contracts you receive a sum equal to three times the annuity you could buy with the entire fund. Personal pensions allow you to take 25 per cent of the fund. Annuity rates are greater the older you are when you vest your pension, so converting all of a pension fund at 55 begins to look unattractive, particularly if you do not need that much income immediately. Annuity rates also vary with gilt yields, so if you happen to retire at a point when gilts are expensive, your entire pension can be lower as a result. Instead, you can opt to vest only part of your pension fund, leaving the rest to grow for a little longer before buying another annuity. This should allow you a greater, more flexible income. You start with smaller income from the annuity, but can use the cash for income. You are also liberated from using only one insurance company for your annuity, so each year you can shop around for the best rate. There are other ways in which the dilemmas of taking an annuity in one fell swoop are eased: The problem of working out whether to accept a lower initial income in return for index-linking (protection against inflation) is eased. Buying an annuity to escalate by five per cent each year means a reduction of 30 per cent in your initial income payment, according to Sun Life. You can buy a different form of annuity later. Deciding on a widow's pension is also easier. Married people will want to take an annuity which will carry on paying an income after the death of one partner. However, this means a reduced annuity - according to Towry Law, providing a widow's pension reduces annuity payments by 20 per cent. The payments will stay this low even if you turn out to be the longer-lived of the couple. With staggered vesting, you can blithely take out an annuity on your life only, knowing that your widow will receive the balance of the pension fund if you die early. Inheritance tax planning is easier. The balance of your pension fund belongs to the life company after your death, if it has been vested and used to buy a pension. But if you have not vested it before reaching the age of 75, the money goes to your heirs, tax-free. However, there are several problems. The most pressing is that the bulk of pension contracts now in existence were not designed with staggered vesting in mind. The systems which administer them had not split them into 'segments', and so the pension providers simply will not be able to allow you to take the pension in stages. The way around this is to transfer into a policy which allows segmentation. Provident Life and Sun Life have taken a lead in producing transfer plans to do this, while others, such as Prudential, plan products for the market. But transferring can cost money, particularly in the case of with-profits contracts which have not yet matured, or company final-salary schemes - you could be offered far less than the accumulated value of your fund as a transfer value. You must check whether your current scheme allows staggered vesting, and what penalties there would be for transferring out. If you would sacrifice too large a chunk of your fund, it is best to forget the idea of staggered vesting. In general, it will be easiest for those with individual or executive pension plans, and hardest for those in company schemes. Providers admit that there is little point in trying to use staggered vesting unless you have a fund of at least Pounds 100,000. For those starting to save for their pension now, the possibility of staggered vesting suggests the use of a series of single-premium policies, rather than a regular premium policy, making it easier to vest some funds, while allowing others to continue. Administrative costs on single-premium plans should also usually be lower. Actuaries Mercer Fraser point out that much of the tax-free cash is used for income under staggered vesting - so 'round the world trips' with a large lump sum will be harder to fund. Then there are the possible costs of administration. You may find yourself paying more in fees or commission by taking this approach, which will create extra work for both intermediaries and providers. Some of these costs might be worth bearing, as staggered vesting makes administration for the individual more difficult, but it is important to shop around accountants and financial advisers to ensure that you do not pay too much. Finally, there is the risk that your pension fund might be poorly managed, or that annuity rates will worsen as you grow older. Both should be unlikely but could happen.</p>

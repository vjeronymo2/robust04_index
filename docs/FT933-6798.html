			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Bonds help push Dow into record territory Wall Street AFTER a hesitant start, a rally in bond prices launched US equity markets firmly into record territory yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 32.98 at 3,638.96. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 4.54 higher at 459.77, while the Amex composite ended up 4.69 at 453.20, and the Nasdaq composite up 4.27 at 735.13. All the indices closed at record highs. Trading volume on the NYSE was 263m shares. In the absence of fresh economic news, there was no real direction to trading, although overnight gains in Tokyo, Frankfurt and London did provide a bullish backdrop. Before the start of trading, dealers said that the fact that on Monday share prices closed down on the day, but still some way above their session lows, was positive and suggested that there was still pent-up demand in the market. This view subsequently appeared to be correct, for there was a steady stream of buyers in early trading. However, it was not until mid-afternoon, when bond prices rallied sharply after a successful two-year note auction, that stocks really took off. Ford climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 51 3/4 after reporting a 6.8 per cent rise in sales of US-made cars during the middle of August. General Motors was also firmer, up Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 46 3/4 , although it reported a modest 0.2 per cent rise in US-made car sales. Chrysler added Dollars 3/4 at Dollars 42 1/8 on reports that its US-made car sales jumped 45.5 per cent. Cyclical stocks were in demand, aided by news of a big increase in second quarterly earnings from John Deere, the big agricultural equipment manufacturer. John Deere shares soared Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 74 in volume of 1.4m shares, Caterpillar added Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 82 3/8 , International Paper firmed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 68, and General Electric edged Dollars  7/8 higher to Dollars 98 5/8 . Selected pharmaceutical stocks went against the market. Schering-Plough ended down Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 60 7/8 , Pfizer down Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 62 1/8 , Merck off Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 32 1/4 and Glaxo ADRs down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 17 1/4 . On the Nasdaq market, Roper Industries rose Dollars 5 to Dollars 67 after declaring a two-for-one stock split and a dividend of 3 cents following good third quarter earnings. Canada TORONTO stocks flirted all day with the August 1987 record close of 4,112.86 but ended a fraction below in active trading. According to preliminary data, the TSE-300 index gained 20.48 points to close at 4,112.24. Trading volume rose to 62.077m shares. Ten of the 14 sub-indices ended higher, with more than 1 per cent gains in energy, industrial products and golds. Saskatchewan Oil said its first-half loss narrowed to CDollars 14.2m and the stock gained 1/4 to 11 1/8 in active trading. Tarragon Oil and Canadian Natural Resources both reported significantly higher second-quarter and six-month earnings. Tarragon jumped 1 1/2 to 21 while Canadian Natural gained 7/8 to 24 1/4.</p>

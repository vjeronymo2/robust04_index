			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Crude solutions The pain among Opec producers has clearly been enough to provoke some kind of discipline. Doubtless, there will still be squabbles about the detail of how the overall production ceiling is divided, and a modest degree of overproduction is only to be expected. Still, it is some measure of the discomfort that all of the cartel's members seem likely to be included in the new arrangements and that Saudi Arabia and Iran are trying to reach an understanding. It can only help prices that, in the short term, capacity constraints probably preclude serious cheating. Yet all that will do little more than keep the market in rough balance. And a modest rally in prices from Dollars 16 a barrel is hardly the stuff of which oil producers' fortunes will be made. The underlying weakness of Opec's position is shown by the lack of progress on planning to accommodate Iraqi oil. Full rehabilitation of Iraq is clearly still some distance away, but the market may have to absorb 500,000 barrels a day of Iraqi crude in 1994 if the UN agrees a deal on humanitarian aid. Beyond that, Opec negotiators will have an eye to the extra 2m barrels a day which will flow from Iraq once it is fully back on stream. Unless there is a dramatic increase in western demand, chronic weakness in oil prices seems the most likely prognosis. But that would not mean outright collapse. Conventional wisdom argues that Opec is at its most solid when hard pressed. An early return of Iraqi oil might be the best thing that could happen to the cartel.</p>

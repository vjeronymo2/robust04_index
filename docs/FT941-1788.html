			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Brittan rejects action over low-wage exporters Sir Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner, yesterday ruled out trade action against foreign exporters into the European Union who benefit from relatively low wages and social costs. He said any such measures would amount to 'naked protectionism' and would not relieve unemployment in Europe. However, he said the EU should propose at next month's ministerial meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Marrakesh, Morocco, that the question of workers' rights should be placed on the agenda of the planned World Trade Organisation. Sir Leon's statement, which was broadly approved by his fellow commissioners, goes some way to meet US demands that workers' rights be made an early priority for the WTO, while firmly rebuffing the most extreme opponents of so-called social dumping on both sides of the Atlantic. His remarks coincided with an apparent softening in the public stance of France, which has so far been the most outspoken critic of social dumping in the EU. The French government said in a statement that countries should not be allowed to gain undue advantage from lax labour and environmental standards. However, it recognised that low-wage competition was 'a fact of international trade' and said that environmental safeguards should not serve as a pretext for trade protection. By steering clear of any proposal which would discriminate against exporters purely on cost grounds, French officials believe they stand a better chance of winning support from industrialised countries for a discussion of labour and environment standards in the WTO. This point was underlined separately by Sir Leon, who said there was 'no chance whatsoever of achieving any international consensus in favour of permitting trade action to be used against countries which do no more than benefit from lower wage or social security costs'. Such action would, in any case, do little to help EU economies, because they imported little from low-cost countries and because labour costs were only one factor determining corporate investment decisions and international competitiveness. Sir Leon said there was no possibility of substantive decisions on trade and social policy issues in Marrakesh, but that the EU should support proposals for a debate in the WTO. The EU should ensure that any future decisions were based on a multilateral approach and on objective criteria. He said the Gatt would allow the EU to act before then by legislating to prohibit imports produced by prison labour. However, he warned that such laws could be difficult to enforce and might amount to little more than a political gesture. He said the EU should also examine ways of monitoring and enforcing more effectively compliance with conventions adopted in the International Labour Organisation and press the US to ratify more such conventions.</p>

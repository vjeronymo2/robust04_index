			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 13 May (MENA)--The Cairo papers, still  riveted by the Yemeni crisis, write in their commentaries today  that the situation in Yemen is an Arab catastrophe on a  dangerous and ugly scale comparable with Iraq's invasion of  Kuwait and the Lebanese civil war.    AL-AHRAM says there will be no vanquished and no victor in  the current war in Yemen. In such senseless wars we all end up  losing, and badly. The paper calls on all Yemenis to listen to  reason and seek a negotiated settlement that would save lives as  well as resources.    The paper asks disapprovingly: How can dialogue be scorned  by brothers at a time when it has been pursued by "sides that  have known enmity for decades" and whose conflict has been more  complicated and deep-seated?    AL-AHRAM says that there may be a grain of truth in claims  that the Yemeni crisis is an internal affair. But this crisis  is undeniably a general Arab and Islamic concern. We cannot be  indifferent to the events in Yemen, because they constitute a  painful blow to every Arab and Islamic tradition, the paper  declares.    Writing on the same topic, AL-JUMHURIYAH says that one cause  of the Yemeni crisis is that some Yemeni leaders tried to fiddle  with the political balances in a newly united country that still  lacked the mature political institutions that can withstand  tinkering. Yemeni leaders, AL-JUMHURIYAH adds, adopted a tribal  perspective and ditched time-tested procedures and norms.    With political acumen obviously lacking, the conflict is  likely to take on a life of its own, AL-JUMHURIYAH predicts. No  one in Aden is likely to honor any pledge of unity with those  who besieged their city and threatened to take it by force. A  lust for revenge has gripped Sanaa, with many ears deafened by  the thunder of missiles and the buzz of planes, the paper  concludes.</p>

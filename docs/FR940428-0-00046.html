			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Provisions governing the duration of eligibility determinations in &sect;600.56 (page 2716). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These final regulations contain one significant difference from the NPRM. In &sect;600.54, the Secretary has added a requirement for a foreign institution to be a public or private nonprofit institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Comments and Changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 415 parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations. Most comments were from persons connected with two foreign graduate medical schools and were nearly identical. An analysis of the comments and of the changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM follows. Substantive issues are discussed under the section of the regulations to which they pertain.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical and other minor changes_and suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under applicable statutory authority_are not addressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 600.54 Criteria for Determining Whether a Foreign Institution is Eligible To Apply To Participate in the FFEL Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter pointed out that section 481(a)(1) of the HEA requires a foreign institution to be comparable to an institution of higher education as defined in section 1201(a) of the HEA, and that the definition in section 1201(a) requires an institution to be a public or private nonprofit institution. The commenter suggested that this requirement be added to the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary agrees with the commenter that a change is necessary to make clear that a for-profit institution is not eligible under these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 600.54 has been revised to require a foreign institution to be a public or private nonprofit educational institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 600.55 Additional Criteria for Determining Whether a Foreign Graduate Medical School is Eligible To Apply To Participate in the FFEL Programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Most commenters opposed the requirement that a training program for foreign medical students be approved by all medical licensing boards and evaluating bodies whose views are considered relevant by the Secretary on the grounds that the Secretary might rely on the judgments of inappropriate bodies. Some commenters were concerned that the Secretary might seek the judgment of a State body over a program located in a different State, if the second State had no such approving body. One commenter suggested that the Secretary require the views of boards and evaluating bodies only in those States where such bodies exist.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One purpose of these regulations is to make certain that facilities, curriculum, equipment, and faculty are comparable in quality to those of medical schools in the United States. The Secretary requires the assurance of that comparability through appropriate impartial and qualified third parties. The Secretary does not consider it unreasonable for an educational program or portion of a program located in a State to obtain the approval of an appropriate medical licensing board or other evaluating body. Which licensing boards and evaluating bodies the Secretary considers relevant will depend on the State in which the program is located, and the time that the application is filed among other relevant factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Most commenters opposed the requirement for an institution, rather than the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG), to provide pass rate data on its students and graduates to the Secretary. One commenter believed that the ECFMG would refuse to release data to institutions, thus effectively denying their eligibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It is the responsibility of an institution seeking to participate in the FFEL programs to establish that it complies with the requirements for eligibility for that participation. Accordingly, the institution must furnish the Secretary with the necessary information for the Secretary to make a determination on the institution's compliance. Institutions are urged to work with the ECFMG and their graduates to obtain the relevant data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

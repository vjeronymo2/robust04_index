			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Syndicated Loans: Saudi Aramco taps market for Dollars 2.4bn SAUDI Aramco, the Saudi state-owned oil company and the world's largest oil exporter, is tapping the international syndicated credit market for the first time with two loans amounting to Dollars 2.4bn. The Saudi oil group is the latest to join a rapidly lengthening list of Middle Eastern borrowers in the international capital markets. Currently J. P. Morgan is assembling a group of international banks to participate in a Dollars 1.5bn four-year general purpose facility for Saudi Aramco, and a Dollars 900m 10-year loan for Vela International, Saudi Aramco's wholly owned subsidiary. The US bank has carved out a niche as the arranger for many of these prestige Middle Eastern credits, including the Dollars 4.5bn loan for Saudi Arabia and Dollars 5.5bn loan for Kuwait's reconstruction, both of which were launched last year. The facility for Saudi Aramco is quite tightly priced, with a margin of 40 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) rising to 45 basis points during the lifetime of the loan. Saudi Aramco carries the full risk weighting under the Basle guidelines on international bank capital adequacy, so bankers expect to be rewarded for the additional capital expense with generous fees - as was the case with the loan to Kuwait. The Dollars 900m loan for Vela International is one of the largest shipping loans to be launched in the international markets. The margin is 60 basis points over Libor, rising to 70 basis points and the loan will be used to finance the purchase of several tankers. At present Saudi Aramco pumps about 8.5m barrels a day (b/d), and it has plans to boost its sustainable oil output capacity to 10m b/d by the middle of the decade. The kingdom is expected to spend more than Dollars 33bn on the development of its oil industry by the end of the decade, including at least Dollars 10bn on upgrading its domestic refineries, Dollars 6bn on the petrochemical industry, and about Dollars 2bn on expanding its oil tanker fleet. According to one bank, two other Saudi borrowers are in discussions with bankers about the possibility of launching large loans. Sharq Petroleum may try to launch a Dollars 300m facility while Ibn Sina (National Methanol Company) may launch a Dollars 275m facility, although both are likely to be domestic rather than international deals. Lasmo, the UK oil exploration group which bid Pounds 1.1bn for oil and gas group Ultramar, has completed a Pounds 450m three-year revolving credit which will be used to retire some of Ultramar's debt. The facility, arranged by Barclays, was originally launched as a Pounds 200m revolving credit 'for general corporate purposes' at the beginning of January. However, the deal was oversubscribed by nearly Pounds 500m, so Lasmo decided to use the opportunity to pay off some of Ultramar's debt. The margin on the facility is 60 basis points over Libor with a commitment fee of 30 basis points on the undrawn balance.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                EUROMARKET TURNOVER (M DOLLARS)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Primary Market        Secondary Market                   US dollars Non-dollars    US dollars Non-dollars Fixed income bonds Euros straight      1,405.6     2,847.6      29,176.1   59,162.8 Other straight          0.0     2,647.9         856.5  109,409.5 Convertible             0.0       104.2       1,460.0    1,245.6 Money market instr FRN                   150.0         0.0       6,586.3    4,875.2 CD's                  177.0       132.0       1,137.1      530.1 Short dollar MT Notes           12,145.1     4,826.8       6,737.3   12,428.1 Warrants                0.0         0.0         682.9      336.0 Equities                0.0         0.0         289.4    1,636.2 Total              13,877.7    10,558.6      46,925.6  189,623.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  Cedel   Euroclear   Total US dollars    23,618.4   37,184.9   60,803.3 Other         65,388.6  134,793.5  200,182.1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Week to February 6, 1992 The Warrants and Equities figures are from Euroclear only Source ISMA  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

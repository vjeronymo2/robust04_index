			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Opposition agrees changes to poll system JAPAN'S leading opposition parties reached a partial agreement yesterday on reforming the country's scandal-stained electoral system, putting pressure on the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to produce an acceptable counter proposal. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, promised last night that he will pursue reforms to cleanse the political system, but the LDP is divided into groups for and against change, and it remains unclear in which camp Mr Miyazawa stands. Six opposition parties agreed at a summit meeting yesterday that the present system of multi-seat constituencies is prone to corruption and should be replaced by a mix of single-seat constituencies and proportional representation, but they failed to agree on the details of the mix. The LDP claims to be in favour of a single-seat system, which would ensure it a comfortable parliamentary majority, and will attempt to shift the responsibility for reform back to the opposition parties, knowing that they will not easily reach agreement. Parliament's present sitting lasts for three more weeks. However the parties have only a week in which to reach agreement, as politicians will then be expected to stop haggling in deference to Prince Naruhito, the heir to the throne, who is to be married in the following week. Meanwhile, Mr Miyazawa is very keen to give the impression that he favours reform, leaving the task of reaching a consensus to other members of his divided party, which is missing the calming influence of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the fallen LDP godfather whose own corruption partly inspired the drive for reform.</p>

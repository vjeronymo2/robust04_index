			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Greed, a dangerous passion - Lessons from the South Sea Bubble are still pertinent / Books THE SOUTH SEA BUBBLE by John Carswell Alan Sutton Pounds 18.99, 293 pages FLIGHT or suicide? Nadir jumped his bail, Maxwell drowned himself. It was ever so. Old Craggs, a major player in the South Sea Bubble, took an overdose of laudanum. Robert Knight, the secretary and lynch-pin of the company, who bribed members of the Commons and peers of influence at Court with the sang-froid of a man who has lost all sense of reality, took the other way out - he fled to the States of Brabant, not quite so difficult to extradite from as North Cyprus but extremely complicated. In those days there was no plea-bargaining, an American invention that half-saves the fraudster. This reprint of Carswell's book, first written in 1960, has been triggered by the discovery of a small cache of documents dealing with the British government's effort to extradite Knight. Although the British government went through the motions of requesting immediate extradition, secretly it begged the States to keep him, even persuading them to fake an escape from Antwerp when he was elsewhere. It is a splendid farcical end to the South Sea saga of 1720-21, but Carswell thinks it to be of more importance than it was. He sees the hand of Robert Walpole everywhere, but it was Townshend, not Walpole, who was responsible for foreign affairs. In 1721 the firm was still Townshend and Walpole, not vice versa. But, as ever, for those who could bear the strain of exposure (and several could not - Stanhope had a heart attack and Sunderland, although found not guilty, succumbed shortly afterwards), the bulk of those involved in the South Sea Bubble frauds survived. Their assets were confiscated. Their holdings in public companies could not be denied but concealment of others proved easy enough and most of them lived on in comfort and not penury. Even Blunt who, after the Knights, was the most guilty of men for he had corrupted the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Aislabie, got off not lightly but at least afloat. There was one difference between these fraudulent men and those who have followed them down the centuries. The South Sea Bubble involved ministers and washed around the Court and the Royal family. One good thing the Bubble achieved was to frighten, forever, the politicians; ministers of the Crown have, since the Bubble, been very circumspect. As for the City, on it goes] In spite of some distortions and errors, the book is a very valuable one and still the best account of the South Sea Bubble. It would make good reading for any city financier: the dangers inherent in the passion for money, in many ways more exciting, more illusory and more destructive than sexual passion, can corrupt quite suddenly men of ability and judgment whose ambitions and opportunities would seem to be satisfied. But greed, like lust, stokes its own flames. England's emerging financiers - promoters of schemes rather than traders, the stockjobbers whom the landed gentry feared, hated yet longed to use - were of short experience, as indeed were those in France who were embroiled in John Law's Mississippi Scheme at the same time. And, of course, there were few rules. Insider trading was in no way illegal; in fact there was little or no control of any kind of chicanery and the judges took the robust view that if the punter was fool enough to be taken in, then it was not for the law to protect him. In the end, the South Sea Bubble proved to be not very grievous in its results - salutary perhaps for merchants and, of course, disastrous for some men, women and families - rather like being a Name at Lloyds today. All were not losers. For those of fine judgment it made millionaires and gave London one of its great hospitals - Guy's, built on Bubble money. Even those whose estates were rightly confiscated, in the mysterious ways of high finance somehow flourished. Money, like dung, tends both to stick and to fertilise. The younger Knight was soon back in the House of Commons and ensconced in a vast Warwickshire country house and an Irish peerage followed. Shame has never been a very common emotion in the City. Carswell is at his best when describing his rogues' gallery of punters. He has a nice eye for human weakness and is not over plagued by a sense of social morality. After all, in the South Sea Bubble it was largely the seriously rich who bled the merely rich. True, a few moderately rich men like Sir Isaac Newton burnt their fingers, and it should be remembered that those who bought their stock and sat on it come hell or high water did quite nicely. Such prudence is still practised by a few when the market goes wild. I feel, however, that there is still a book to be written about the South Sea Bubble, but until it is written Carswell must be kept in print. In spite of errors of scholarship and of judgment, it is a splendid dramatic tale which rings bells and teaches wisdom.</p>

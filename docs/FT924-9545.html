			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Volvo to close two Swedish plants VOLVO, Sweden's leading car group, is to close two of its three Swedish car plants as part of a sweeping rationalisation of its car and truck operations. The measures, announced yesterday, will result in the loss of 4,500 jobs, or 10 per cent of the overall workforce, by 1995. The cuts reflect the sharp decline in sales in Volvo's three main markets - the US, UK and Sweden - and seven quarters of losses in its core operations. The aim is to achieve group operating income of SKr5.5bn (Dollars 940m) by 1995. Car production will now be concentrated at the Torslanda plant in Sweden and at Ghent in Belgium. The Uddevalla and Kalmar plants will be closed to achieve annual cost savings of SKr350m. Uddevalla, which only started operations in 1989, will be closed next spring and Kalmar in mid-1994. A total of 1,600 jobs will be cut. The closures are a personal setback for Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's chairman. Under his guidance, both plants fostered new production methods, involving multi-skilled assembly-work teams, rather than traditional assembly line methods. The company said the closures were entirely dictated by market factors, not because of deficiencies in the new techniques. Volvo expects car sales of just over 200,000 this year, excluding the small 400 series. In Sweden, the US and the UK, it forecasts total sales of 120,000-130,000 large cars, compared with 200,000 in 1988. Production capacity, following the plant closures, will be 300,000 large cars, compared with 370,000 today. Volvo's new chief executive, Mr Soren Gyll, said rationalisation was needed to safeguard the company's future product development and competitiveness. 'We must reduce our overall cost structure and adjust our organisation to market conditions.' Meanwhile, Volvo Trucks announced 2,000 job losses due to a rationalisation programme which aims to cut costs by SKr2.5bn by 1995. 'There is no indication of any improvement in the market and an increase in sales in the near future,' it said. A total of 500 jobs are also to be cut at Torslanda. There will also be job cuts at Volvo Penta and at two small car factories.</p>

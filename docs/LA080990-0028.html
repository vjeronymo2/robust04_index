			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL DROPS UTILITY TAX MEASURE  </P> <P> The Lawndale City Council this week dropped plans to place a proposed utility  tax on the November ballot but postponed a decision on budget cuts to offset  the unexpected loss of $91,000 in state funds.  </P> <P> The council last week ordered city staff to draw up the text of the measure,  which would have imposed a 2% tax on residents and businesses and generated  $240,000 a year for the city's general fund.  </P> <P> But during a budget hearing Monday, after questions were raised about whether  seniors and low-income residents should be exempt from the tax, the measure's  two strongest advocates withdrew their support.  </P> <P> Mayor Harold Hofmann said he withdrew his support for the tax because the  council had run out of time to revise the measure before the election. But he  added: "I'd almost say for sure we're going to see it on the June ballot."  </P> <P> The council delayed voting on its $7.8-million budget last week after learning  that the state is cutting back on a year-old program designed to give  additional funds to cities that get little or no revenue from property taxes  collected within their borders. City officials expected to receive $163,000  from the program this year, but they were notified last week that they can  count on only about $72,000.  </P> <P> Although no decision on the budget was reached Monday night, the council  discussed cutting some programs, travel expenses and as many as four City Hall  positions to make up for the shortfall. The council's next budget workshop is  set for Monday.  </P></p>

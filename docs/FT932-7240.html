			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Letter: Cable TV development restrained by old technology (1) Sir, I noted with interest you editorial comments regarding a compromise which would allow BT to overcome the asymmetry rule, which remains an extraordinary restraint on trade. You are correct in stating (Leading article: 'Cable television', May 19) that information super-highways should be built because of genuine consumer demand, although it should be borne in mind that, as a rule, telecommunications applications are developed only when a network infrastructure exists to support them - a classic chicken and egg situation  -of which ISDN is a prime example. The trade and industry select committee should bear this in mind if and when it launches an inquiry. If BT is seriously expected to compete as a successful global player in the US market, then the Department of Trade and Industry will have to lift the restrictions that prevent BT from making more efficient use of its existing network. The asymmetry rule preventing BT and Mercury from using its network for broadcast entertainment retards the introduction of fibre towards the house and office, and the development of new services. My union has been at the forefront of the argument for a national broadband grid or 'network of the future'. However, this requires a regulatory regime that encourages modernisation of BT's local loop by making it commercially viable - and the obvious way to do this is to relax the asymmetry rule. As John Harper, former managing director of BT, argues, the regulatory regime and industry structure in Britain acts 'as a drag rather than a help to the early stages of exploitation and application of broadband technology'. Few of the UK cable companies are laying fibre to the home. Instead, we are experiencing a proliferation of co-axial and copper cable - leaving us with the prospect of two outmoded local loops. It is essential that, if the government wants to modernise the UK's telecoms networks in the interest of residential customers, business customers and international competitiveness, removal of the asymmetry rule must be a priority.

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / World News in Brief: Strong earthquake rocks Japan's main north island An intense earthquake killed two people and injured more than 190 when it erupted under the sea off Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido, sending potentially devastating tidal waves rushing towards the coast. The quake was measured at 8.2 on the Richter scale by the US Geological Survey and at 7.9 by Japan's main earthquake centre. Japan's national television network NHK reported 196 people injured on Hokkaido's east coast. Many isolated areas, particularly small islands close to the epicentre, were cut off from communications.</p>

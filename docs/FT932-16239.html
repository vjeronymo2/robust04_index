			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Hata spurns chance to be host to G7 WHEN THE job of Japanese foreign minister suddenly became vacant yesterday, Mr Tsutomu Hata, leader of a rebel faction in the ruling Liberal Democratic party, was offered the chance to sit at the top table with the Group of Seven leading industrial nations and turned it down. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, turned the need to appoint a foreign minister into a great opportunity to embarrass a political rival, as Mr Hata glumly explained that his role in a domestic political reform campaign was more important than the ministerial post. After Mr Hata turned down the job, made vacant by Mr Michio Watanabe's resignation yesterday due to failing health, Mr Miyazawa offered it to another member of the Watanabe faction, Mr Kabun Muto, 66 - a former minister of international trade and industry and Mr Watanabe's choice, accepted the post. Prime Minister Miyazawa knew that Mr Hata, highly regarded by the public, would agonise over the decision, as Japan is to chair the G7 this year. Mr Hata would have been host to a meeting of foreign and finance ministers next week to discuss Russia, and taken a leading role in preparations for a July summit. Mr Watanabe, 69, was admitted to hospital yesterday suffering from a 'a cold and overwork'. It was the third time in a year he has had to seek hospital treatment, and he conceded that he was not fit enough to cope with a tough schedule in coming months. The loss of Mr Watanabe will be a blow to Japanese foreign policy, as he is regarded a powerful operator within the ministry, capable of forcing the bureaucracy to react quickly. A European diplomat said: 'Mr Watanabe was a man who could get things done, but I'm not sure the same could be said about his successor.'</p>

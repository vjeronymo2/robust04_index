			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Restrictions Put on Singer Co.: The firm has been barred from selling any of  its assets or paying stock dividends pending a lawsuit about claims that a  former subsidiary defrauded the government. The company, named as a  co-defendant in a civil suit against its former Link Flight Simulation  division, was also ordered not to incur any new debt or make any payments to  investor Paul A. Bilzerian, the Florida financier who acquired the company last  year. The preliminary injunction was sought by the Justice Department, which  last March joined the $231-million lawsuit that had originally been filed by a  former Link Flight pricing administrator.  </P></p>

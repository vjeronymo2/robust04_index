The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in the proceeding governed by antidumping duty orders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping duty order, the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of this review will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.32 percent, the ``all others'' rate established in the LTFV investigation (56 FR 25660, June 5, 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act and 19 CFR 353.22.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: February 22, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Joseph A.

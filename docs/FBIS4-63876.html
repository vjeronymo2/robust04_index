			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Aleksandr Mineyev and Vladimir </F> Smelov]    [Text] Brussels May 25 TASS -- Russian Defence Minister  Pavel Grachev told ITAR-TASS upon completion of his meeting with  the U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry that Perry's reaction  to the Russian concept of expanded cooperation with NATO was  "even".    "Apparently, this is connected with the fact that the U.S.  side is not aware yet about main parameters of our proposals to  this effect which will be submitted to the acting U.N. secretary  general on Wednesday," Grachev said    During Grachev's talks with Perry which continued over an  hour the sides discussed problems of bilateral cooperation,  Grachev said. "Our cooperation is growing stronger day-by-day  and we are reaching a greater degree of mutual understanding,"  Grachev said.    Grachev felt at ease in the U.N. Headquarters. He arrived  twenty minutes ahead of schedule, wearing an elegant dark-blue  suit, while Perry was about six minutes late. However, this did  not affect the constructive atmosphere of the talks and was  fully compensated by a continuous discussion.    Grachev confirmed that Russia makes no conditions concerning  its participation in the Partnership for Peace programme. "We  have a broader vision of cooperation and interaction with NATO  than other countries. We suggest such directions for  partnership which are characteristic only of Russia and some  other NATO member-states. For instance, this concerns nuclear  weapons and nuclear control, non-proliferation, reduction and  elimination of nuclear arsenals and the transfer of such weapons  along the Russian territory," Grachev said.    Parameters for interaction with NATO suggested by Russia  today will be used as a basis for a document suggested to be  prepared. The document can be drawn either in the form of a  protocol of intentions, an agreement or a programme, which does  not matter," Grachev said. " The most important thing is that  apart from other relations of partnership, suggested to all  countries, Russia offers additional proposals which are not  characteristic of other states. Russia does not intend to impose  anything on anyone and look for its own "warm place" in the  system of partnership, Grachev said.    Perry described Grachev's speech outlining the new Russian  military doctrine as a historic event of great importance. He  pointed out that the United States welcomed Russia's readiness  to join the Partnership for Peace programme without amy  preliminary conditions. He pointed out that during the talks  the two sides discussed problems pertaining to holding joint  military exercises on the Russian territory. Considerable  attention was paid to cooperation in the field of nuclear  non-proliferation, and in particular, to North Korea's nuclear  problem and bilateral efforts made by the Russian Federation and  the United States for the Bosnian settlement.    After the fifth consecutive meeting between the Russian and  the U.S. ministers the two sides are working in the atmosphere  of more close contacts, resolving problems of ensuring security  in different regions of the world, the U.S. defense secretary  said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed MSC: "Soil Bacteria Exchange DNA" ] </F>   [Text] Soil bacteria transfer plasmids to one another on a  large scale. Therefore, when genetically altered bacteria are  released in nature, the foreign DNA should not be added into the  plasmids, but into the chromosomes of these organisms. Dr. Eric  Smit analyzed the risk of putting genetically altered  micro-organisms in the ground. He will soon obtain a doctorate  in Wageningen on this subject. Smit put an easily recognizable  plasmid in bacteria and released it in various soils. Next he  verified whether other bacteria would adopt the plasmid. This  was primarily the case under life conditions favoring the  micro-organisms, e.g. around the roots of plants or when  nutrients had been added to the soil. This is probably due to a  greater density or a greater bacterial division activity. It  has already been known that plasmid transmission in water is  absolutely normal.</p>

The CIS is actually assuming a new  quality, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev stated after the  session.    He said the ministers discussed the protection of the  external borders of the CIS. According to Kozyrev, the  discussion took place in a businesslike and constructive  atmosphere which left Russia satisfied.    In his opinion the adoption of a decision on the formation  of  a consultative commission for the peaceful settlement of  differences within the CIS is an important step taking the  Commonwealth forward.    The convention on the protection of ethnic minorities was a  more complicated matter, he said. "On the one hand, some  countries are not sending their experts to working groups. As a  result, their ministers find themselves in a difficult situation  because are not in the know. On the other, this is an  indication of the lack of readiness of several countries to  discuss this complex and delicate matter," Kozyrev said.    He said there are problems in this respect with Azerbaijan,  Uzbekistan and Ukraine.    In Kozyrev's opinion, one should not attach political  meaning  to the fact that some countries were represented by ambassadors  and other officials, instead of ministers at the Wednesday  session. "After all anyone can fall ill or have important  domestic matters to resolve. The absence of several ministers  does not mean that they were not interested in the meeting,"  Kozyrev said.    Only Russia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and Georgia  were represented at the meeting by foreign ministers. Ukraine  was represented by its ambassador in Moscow Vladimir  Krzhanitskiy, Belarus by Deputy Foreign Minister Petr Belyayev,  Kyrgyzstan by the Acting Foreign Minister Alibek Jekshenkulov,  Armenia by Deputy Foreign Minister Armen Kirakosian, Moldova by  Deputy Foreign Minister Ion Cebuk, Turkmenistan by Vice Premier  Boris Shikhmuradov, Uzbekistan by the ambassador in Russia Yusuf  Abdullayev.    The meeting was also attended by Executive CIS Secretary  Ivan  Korotchenya and the Chief of Staff for Coordinating Military  Cooperation Colonel-General Victor Samsonov.    After the session the foreign ministers were joined by the  defence ministers of the CIS countries that signed the  collective security treaty.    They are expected to make a joint statement after the  meeting.</p>

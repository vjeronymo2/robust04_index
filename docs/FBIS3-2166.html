At a joint press conference with visiting Ukrainian  President  Leonid Kravchuk, Clinton said the new relationship between the  two countries would make a better future for the people of both  nations.    Kravchuk, who has signed a number of accords on economic and  trade cooperation with the U.S., said today marked a "historic  moment" in friendly relations between Washington and Kiev.    Clinton praised Kiev's endorsement of the  U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian accord signed last January on getting rid  of the 1,800 nuclear warheads on Ukrainian soil as well as the  first strategic arms reduction treaty.    The U.S. President also expressed the hope that the  Ukrainian  parliament would eventually approve the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty.    He welcomed Ukraine's commitment to comprehensive market  reforms as well as Kiev's agreement to join NATO's Partnership  for Peace Program last month.    Kravchuk, whose country is now experiencing an economic  crisis, brought an entourage of high-ranking officials including  the ministers for foreign affairs, defense, economics on the  current official visit.    At the core of the talks between the two leaders were  economic matters, which apparently is the main purpose of  Kravchuk's visit.    Clinton also promised today to press for economic aid from  other Western countries and lending agencies to Ukraine.    Besides meeting with U.S. officials, Kravchuk will also be  seeing officials from the International Monetary Fund and the  World Bank on outside economic assistance.    Kravchuk leaves for New York Saturday for a meeting with  U.N.  Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and to attend the opening  of Ukraine's general consulate.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Survey of Wales (3): Rich diversity of schemes - Training initiatives JUST OVER two years ago Diane Hughes wanted to return to work. With her children growing up there was less need for her to be present 24 hours a day. The problem was that in Menai Bridge, her home, there was no nursery, and no nursery meant no return to work. Mrs Hughes was not one to sit back and accept the inevitable, though. She set up her own nursery and within 18 months it was full. Fired by enthusiasm, and by her success, Mrs Hughes decided to expand and open another on Parc Menai, a business park on the edge of Bangor. Just the place, she reckoned, as the women working in the offices there would need and welcome the facilities she will provide. Mrs Hughes's initiative, which has led to the creation of seven jobs, won her an award presented by the Midland Bank and Targed, the training and enterprise council covering north west Wales. 'It just shows what can be done with a little initiative,' says Ms Enid Rowlands, chief executive of Targed. 'A lot of women are setting up in business in this part of Wales, especially farmers' wives, where there is now a very great need to bring in extra income as farming is going through a difficult time. We can help them in all sorts of ways to become independent and viable.' Jobs for working women are not the only requirement in north Wales - 'education has always had a high priority in family life in this part of the country,' Ms Rowlands says, 'so academic attainments are high. But there is still a need to improve skill levels.' Training rather than enterprise tends to be a more important role for the seven Tecs in Wales, because of the support given towards stimulating enterprise by the Welsh Development Agency. In this respect, the situation in Wales is closer to that in Scotland than England. The Tecs tend to place rather more emphasis on small firms and start-ups, which is where a lot of the job-creation is to be found; consequently, two-thirds of Ms Rowlands' Pounds 15m budget goes towards training, split 60:40 between youth and adult work. Large businesses are not ignored, though. In Cardiff, Mr Sheldon, chief executive of the South Glamorgan Tec, is keen to provide help for companies such as British Airways and Bosch, two recent incomers, especially if they take people off the unemployed register. With BA, for instance, it has helped fund a scheme out of its Pounds 13m budget in which it meets the cost of the third year of a college course in order to improve good long-term training. For Ms Rowlands at Targed, size has a different connotation. There are probably only 20 large companies in Gwynedd, so much of her thrust is directed towards companies with fewer than 20 employees. South Glamorgan's unique approach is to have introduced the first business credit in Britain. It offers Pounds 5,000 to companies wanting buy a range of services, such as consultancy, or helping with the cost of senior managers attending skill seminars. The Tec will meet two-thirds of the cost of these services. There has been a reasonable take-up, Mr Sheldon says - 'the problem is that in the present recession too few companies can afford to lay out the other third but, as the economy picks up, I expect greater use to be made of this facility.' MOST of the demand for services within the Targed area comes from within its boundaries. Further east in Clwyd, the situation is slightly different. The county's workforce also looks to England, and especially the Chester conurbation for employment, so that the Tec has rather different priorities. In Clwyd, the Tec is known as Training and Enterprise and its area is a net exporter of workers. About one in every five works outside the area whereas only one in every 10 jobs is accounted for by someone travelling in to the area. The sort of work Targed undertakes is illustrated by a recent case involving a bakery in Bala. Berwyn Bakery had a fine reputation in Gwynedd and beyond. Its biscuits were - and still are - much sought after. Its reputation grew as the company took display stands at several exhibitions; as its reputation grew, so did demand. The rise in orders, however, threatened to overwhelm the bakery - total employment five - and the company put out an SOS call to Targed. The agency sent in a consultant, drew up a development plan which pointed a sensible way forward, and met part of the costs. The result was that Berwyn could cope with the increased orders, turnover and profits rose, and the company now employs 20. That figure may seem miniscule by comparison with the thousands expected eventually at British Airways's new maintenance plant outside Cardiff. But in the context of Bala it was significant.</p>

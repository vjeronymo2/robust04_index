			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Tories attack motorway toll plans Government plans to introduce tolls for motorway users were thrown into confusion yesterday by a fiercely critical report from a Tory-dominated committee of MPs. The Commons transport committee says in its report that the government's arguments for motorway tolls in a green paper published last May were 'unconvincing'. It suggests that an increase in fuel duty would be cheaper and easier to collect. The committee says: 'The government will have to provide a great deal more information before parliament and the public can be persuaded that the green paper's proposals for electronic tolling are either desirable or workable.' Fuel duty 'does not suffer from the defect of tolls, namely that motorists will be inclined to avoid payment by diverting on to other roads'. This could lead to the 'totally unacceptable' prospect of between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of vehicles diverting from motorways on to 'unsuitable local roads' at peak times, leading to 'additional accidents and casualties, as well as environmental damage', the MPs warn in their report. The MPs also attack the government's refusal to earmark the proceeds of an increase in fuel duty for motorway spending, saying this would breach the Treasury's rule against such use of tax revenues. They say this policy is 'purely an accounting convention' and has no statutory basis. A further 'fundamental weakness of the green paper', the MPs say, was its lack of a guarantee that proceeds from tolls would be 'genuinely additional money for spending on roads', and would not simply be recouped by the Treasury. Dr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, described the report as 'an important addition to the public debate on this issue'. He said toll revenue would be used only to improve the tolled network, and added: 'Without improvements, the diversion of traffic which worries the committee will happen spontaneously.' He said the government's two-year research programme into technology for the network would continue. Labour dismissed tolls as 'another Tory tax', while road-user groups also gave strong support to the committee. The Royal Automobile Club said the government must 'go back to the drawing board', while the Automobile Association said tolls were 'another unacceptable general tax on motoring'. The British Road Federation predicted that it was 'unlikely any revenue from tolling will be available to accelerate the motorway improvement programme before 2000 at the very earliest', and said the government should 'urgently' investigate other sources of funding. However, the Freight Transport Association, representing industrial road users, said the committee had 'got in a muddle' over whether motorway charging was meant simply to raise money or to provide a 'value-for-money motorway system'. It said increased fuel tax was a 'blunt instrument' which would have an adverse effect on rural areas. Charging for the Use of Motorways, House of Commons Paper HC 376-I, HMSO, Pounds 11.</p>

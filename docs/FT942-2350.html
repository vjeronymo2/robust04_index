			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Arts: Today's Television When keen to annoy the boys, Maisie of 'The Perishers' used to ask disingenuously 'Is this the kick ball season or the hit ball season?' Perhaps she still does, but who reads the Daily Mirror these days? It seems unlikely, anyway, because the internationalisation of sport has ensured that there are virtually no seasons any more. Today television brings us the opening day's play from the hit ball matches at Wimbledon with highlights in Today At Wimbledon on BBC1 at 10.10. That is followed by highlights from the last day's play in the England/New Zealand hit ball match at Lord's in Cricket: Second Test (BBC1 11.10). But the big sports event, of course, is the kick ball tournament in the USA. Brazil play Russia in World Cup Grandstand on BBC2 at 8.30, then Holland play Saudi Arabia in World Cup 94 on ITV at 11.40. Those siding with Maisie may prefer to listen to I Fiamminghi on Radio 3 in a concert which includes work by Handel, Boccherini and Purcell (7.30) or 'The Monday Play' on Radio 4: The Devil's Province (7.45). This is about getting by with the locals in Provence ..in 1213 when efforts were under way to suppress the Cathar heresy.</p>

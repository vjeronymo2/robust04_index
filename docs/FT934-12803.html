			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Portraits of families at war: India's economic reform is exposing splits in family-run business groups Mr Siddharth Shriram, a 49-year-old Indian businessman locked in a family row with his 76-year-old father, says: 'My father's got the wrong mind-set. His mind-set is that elders in this country are always right.' Mr Charat Ram, the father, retorts that his son may be 'intelligent and dynamic' but should 'pay more attention to his responsibilities'. The two men are quarrelling over the running of a loss-making, family-controlled company that makes sewing machines. Previously they might have tried to settle their differences in private. But the onset of economic reform, launched by the government in 1991, is putting pressure on the family-run groups that dominate Indian industry and is straining even strong family loyalties. The impact of the feuding goes beyond the founding family - disrupting relations with other shareholders and outside partners, including foreign companies. Those families that cannot keep their arguments from hurting their businesses will suffer. Indian companies are usually run by a patriarch who employs his relatives in an extended family enterprise. In theory, the family lives in harmony and holds everything in common. In practice, there have often been rows, as in family businesses in any country. India is particularly prone to such disputes because it has no primogeniture, so potential heirs squabble over their rights, sometimes for years. Also, tough tax and foreign exchange control laws discourage families from making cash settlements for fear of disclosing their wealth. So, large numbers of heirs have to be accommodated. Even after a family has launched companies on the stock market and diluted ownership to 20 per cent or less, family members usually dominate management. Directorships, chairmanships and even whole companies are created to accommodate personal whims. But a generation of businessmen now in their 40s, typically heirs of ageing fathers, is challenging these traditional values. These men have often worked abroad and want to promote foreign-trained managers. They believe the principle of family-first cannot survive the competitive pressures of economic deregulation. The fathers do not necessarily dispute this view. But they often lack the younger generation's sense of urgency. They do not want to retire, at least not yet. Mr T. Thomas, a former director of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch multinational, and a top Bombay businessman, says: 'The people at the top love to hold on to power.' Four father-son power struggles have come into the open this year. The first, involving Mr Shriram and his father, is being fought in a family with a long history of arguments over sharing its wealth. The most recent split was in the mid-1980s when the group's interests, including sugar, oils, chemicals, textiles and engineering, were divided between Mr Ram and his brother, and Mr Ram's two sons. Mr Ram got control of Jay Engineering, the troubled sewing machine maker. However, it performed so badly after the share-out that Mr Ram turned to his son Mr Shriram for help. Mr Shriram agreed - as long as he was given a free hand. Mr Ram promised to hand over the chairmanship to Mr Shriram, but has so far not carried out his pledge. Businessmen who know the family say the real bone of contention is the favour Mr Ram has shown over many years to Mr NR Dongre, a group manager who has been given substantial blocks of shares by Mr Ram. Mr Ram has told journalists that Mr Dongre is 'an excellent top-ranking manager' and that Mr Shriram should 'take a lesson or two from Mr Dongre'. Mr Shriram does not take kindly to such advice. The atmosphere is even more tense at Apollo Tyres, one of India's largest tyremakers with annual sales of more than Rs5bn (Pounds 106m) and the core of a group headed by Mr Raunaq Singh. Mr Singh is Apollo's chairman. But daily management has for the past decade been in the hands of his son - Mr Onkar Singh Kanwar, the vice-chairman. Mr Kanwar now wants to take over as chairman but his father refuses to budge. Mr Kanwar is widely credited with transforming Apollo from a sleepy company into a professionally run unit. He wants to respond to economic liberalisation by concentrating his resources on tyremaking. His father wants to diversify into fields that are being opened up by deregulation. The arguments are so bitter that Mr Singh has accused his son of making undisclosed investments such as a Rs50m loan to Mr Harshad Mehta, the stockbroker at the centre of last year's securities market scandal. Mr Kanwar disputes the accusations. Meanwhile, in the family of Mr Mohan Singh, a 76-year-old Delhi-based pharmaceuticals entrepreneur, the arguments have reached such a pitch that a former chief justice of India has been asked to arbitrate. The quarrels began three years ago when Mr Mohan Singh divided his business between his three sons. Mr Parvinder Singh, the eldest, was given Ranbaxy Laboratories, the family's flagship. However, the gifts came with strings attached. As Mr Mohan Singh says, without a touch of irony: 'I gave everybody freedom. The only condition was that they work under my supervision and control.' Mr Parvinder Singh has refused to acknowledge his father's supremacy. To make matters worse he has managed Ranbaxy Laboratories so well that, with a turnover of Rs5bn a year, his business is now twice the size of his two brothers' combined interests. Mr Kedar Nath Modi, patriarch of one branch of the Delhi-based Modi business family, is embroiled in a similar argument with his middle son Mr Yogendra Modi. The elder Mr Modi divided his businesses - including cement, textiles and chemicals - between his three sons a decade ago but insisted on a redistribution in the late 1980s after it emerged that his middle son was making far more money than his two brothers. Mr Yogendra Modi reluctantly agreed to a new settlement. But once more he proved better at managing his portion than his brothers - so this year his father has tried to impose a second redistribution. Even a former cabinet secretary, called in to arbitrate, has failed to resolve the dispute. These arguments hurt business performance. At Apollo Tyres, senior managers and accountants are now spending time and energy investigating the charges levelled by Mr Raunaq Singh against his son. At Ranbaxy Laboratories, foreign technology suppliers have expressed concern to the management about the stability of commercial ties. It is no accident that the most successful family-controlled groups have generally avoided public arguments. Tata, India's largest industrial combine, has for decades fostered good relations between family and non-family managers. Family members have always headed the group, but non-family executives have chaired important operating companies. However, Tata's recent past has also been blighted by a family-style struggle between Mr Ratan Tata, the 56-year-old scion of the founding family who took control in the late 1980s, and a slew of older executives in their 70s. Mr Ratan Tata won. As long as the family is in charge the temptation remains to put family interests first. As Mr N. Vaghul, chairman of the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India, a development bank, says: 'The problem is that decisions are geared not to business needs but to family needs.' He believes that, as in the west, professionals will gradually take over from family managers. But, judging by this year's rows, not all groups will manage the delicate transition.</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Western countries seen importing 70% of oil needs WESTERN industrialised countries could import 70 per cent of their oil in the next 10 to 15 years - more than double the present rate, according to a report entitled World Energy Outlook by the International Energy Agency, the West's monitoring body. Ms Helga Steeg, executive director of the IEA suggested that the West should increase its oil emergency stocks as its dependence on imports rises. IEA countries hold stocks of 90 days oil consumption. The IEA said oil consumption by OECD countries could increase to more than 45m barrels a day from the 1990 level of under 38m b/d. That would mean importing 9m b/d more oil at 31.4m b/d. Increased levels of imports were expected to come from the Middle East and Venezuela, which could account for 50 per cent of OECD oil imports. The IEA said Russian oil output could reach 10m b/d by 2010 from its current average of 9m b/d, but the body stressed that that was its best guess for the country and that more accurate forecasts were impossible because of political and economic uncertainties. The IEA assumed as part of its scenario that oil prices would rise gradually to Dollars 30 a barrel by 2005 (in 1993 money) and then flatten out. If crude prices remained flat in real terms the West would become even more dependent on imports as its own relatively high-cost oil output would decline even further. While overall consumption of oil was expected to increase, the IEA expected oil's share of total world energy requirements to continue to decline from 39 per cent to 37 per cent. Gas on the other hand, was seen increasing its market share by 3 percentage points to just over 24 per cent. World electricity demand was expected to grow fastest largely because prices were not expected to rise as quickly as for other fuels. Electricity's share of global energy demand was expected to rise to 21.8 per cent by 2010 from 18.8 per cent. Mr Lakis Vouyoukas, IEA's senior economist, forecast 'phenomenal' growth in gas use for power generation in the next 10 years, particularly in Europe, where its use was expected to rise by 6 per cent. The agency saw coal demand growth continuing, but forecast further slowing in the growth rate for nuclear power because of increased costs and safety concerns. Coal usage was expected to meet 29 per cent of energy needs by 2010 and nuclear power 6 per cent. The introduction of carbon taxes and other measures to curb emissions could have a big effect on the energy markets in the next 17 years. The IEA's analysis showed that a tax of Dollars 100 per tonne of carbon (Dollars 12 a barrel for oil) would partly stem the rise of emissions, but not reduce them. Without a tax, OECD carbon emissions were expected to rise by 28 per cent by 2010. With Dollars 100 tax per tonne of carbon, emmission growth would be 9 per cent lower.</p>

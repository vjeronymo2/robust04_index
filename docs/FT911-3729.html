			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Arts: Robert Wilson's 'Night before the Day' - Paula Deitz on the American director's latest presentation: a retrospective exhibition of his work together with his new production, Ibsen's 'When we Dead Awaken' Robert Wilson, the theatre director, writer, designer and artist, was born in Waco, Texas, lives in New York City, and has preferred to work in Berlin, Paris and other cultural capitals of Europe. During the past season, though, Boston and Cambridge have provided the artist, who will be 50 this year, with two opportunities for world premieres that will travel across the country. They mark a new stage in his career. Wilson's stock-in-trade is to give concrete form to a combination of visionary images and gestures gleaned from daily observation. Placed in a theatrical, indeed operatic setting, these fragments are made to cohere by a third ingredient - the attention and imagination of his audience. In many ways, he is closer to Wagner than Ionesco, for though the absurd may be buried in the material, it is the epic themes and variations, repetitiously unfurled during long performances like those of Einstein on the Beach, that shape the disjointed parts into a memorable whole. And even where a performance may lag, there is the architecture of the set and his painterly use of light that make the experience more than just a worthwhile representation. At the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Robert Wilson's Vision, the first retrospective of the artist's work in a decade, is as much a performance as an exhibition. And across the Charles River in Cambridge, the American Repertory Theatre at Harvard premiered Wilson's production of Henrik Ibsen's last play, When We Dead Awaken, which will now be moving with the exhibition to Houston, Texas, and, one would hope, to other cities here and abroad. As is often the case, an outside discipline can channel creativity into unusual depths, and here an 1899 play (Wilson usually writes his own scripts), whose symbolist themes are compatible with Wilson's techniques, has given the director a chance to cut loose in amazing ways. Not the least of these are the inclusion of some hauntingly beautiful blues songs, composed and sung by tap dancer Charles 'Honi' Coles, sometimes with the whole cast, during the 'Knee Plays', the brief performances in the intervals that are the joints between the acts. Both the exhibition and the play are accompanied by sound environments composed by Wilson's longtime collaborator, Hans Peter Kuhn. In designing the exhibition, a work of installation art in itself, Wilson created a journey through three major galleries that, like any classical drama, suggests the passage of a single day. 'The Night before the Day,' as he calls the installation, features objects and furniture used as props, drawings, paintings, maquettes and actual sets from his past productions. The entrance through a long dark corridor sounds like a wind tunnel with distant bird calls and leads to a room the colour of dawn, where, among other objects, his hanging wire mesh chairs and tables are doubled by their perfect shadows on the walls. Such objects as the Japanese-style puppets, used in 'Knee Plays' during CIVIL WarS, and the glass and neon light bulb from Death Destruction and Detroit are elegant in themselves though somehow denuded of their active stage roles. More illuminating are the black-and-white drawings of his stage designs that convey with solid and luminously transparent planes the great sense of stage distance he achieves. One drawing, for 'A Letter for Queen Victoria,' demonstrates how something as simple as the back of an envelope can inspire the diagonals of his stage design. The final gallery, dark as night, is aglow with the moving lights of the grid - like the interior of the spaceship from the climax of Einstein on the Beach: being so close to it fulfils an audience fantasy of wanting to be in it. Having recently seen a more traditional production of When We Dead Awaken performed by the Jean Cocteau Repertory in New York, I am convinced that Wilson has given a more thoughtful and penetrating interpretation of this enigmatic play, which Ibsen saw as the epilogue of his previous works. The new translation is by Robert Brustein, the ART's artistic director. Rubek, the famous but ageing sculptor who attempts to rekindle his creative spark, rejects his young, earthy but boring wife, Maya, for a kind of spiritual meeting with the model, Irene, who inspired his greatest work and who may or may not be alive. The sets of mountainous seaside scenes, with rivers of glass and glacial peaks are realistic enough and make one sense the starkness of the terrain. The 'music' of clanking metal and roaring sea evokes a desolate landscape as well. But the constructions, as of a metal cage cum labyrinth where Irene and her keeper, here her inner self, take interminable walks, add to the psychological force of the dialogue. The sets and costumes recall the sombre beauty of 19th-century Scandinavian landscape and figure painting. Wilson has hewed to the force of the script and each act takes his audience higher into the mountains in a natural ascent to the fatal avalanche. The line from Charles 'Honi' Coles' first song - 'I was alone when I met her/ Now I wish I was alone' - becomes a good refrain for the play. When We Dead Awaken will be presented by the Alley Theatre in Houston, Texas, May 22 - May 26. Robert Wilson's Vision will go on exhibit in Houston at the Contemporary Arts Museum, June 15 - August 18 and at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, September 12 - December 1.

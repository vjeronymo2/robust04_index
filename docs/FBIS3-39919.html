He warned that whether Sinn Fein joined or stayed out the  Government wanted to continue to seek political progress through  talks involving the constitutional parties in the province.  "There can be no question of Sinn Fein having a veto on  progress," he insisted.    Mr Hurd told a Tory meeting in Westminster: "If Sinn Fein  and  the Provisional IRA renounce support for violence and terrorism  permanently, then Sinn Fein could join this political progress.  They can then contribute to deciding on the future for Northern  Ireland by democratic means. The offer is on the table and will  stay there."    Mr Hurd said market research showed that 97 percent of the  people in Ireland backed the declaration when it was issued.    "Only Sinn Fein have given no response. In the United States  Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, obscured the real reason.  At his party conference this weekend, Sinn Fein have another  opportunity to give their response. They should do so."    Mr Hurd added: "There are no good reasons for further delay.  Britain and Ireland are today close partners, both in planning  the future of these two islands and in Europe. We are in  complete agreement that the future of the people of the island  of Ireland must be determined by its people. The process must  be one of self-determination, not one in which others try to  impose a solution, and not one in which a solution will be  imposed by a particular party or by violence."    He warned: "Moreover -- and this is central to the message  for Sinn Fein -- an enforced settlement that ignores present  realities could never succeed. Holding the view that partition  is wrong does not justify trying to enforce Irish unity.  Differences within the island of Ireland will never be bridged  by an imposed settlement. Terrorism can only reinforce these  differences. What is needed is agreement and consent between  the people of the island of Ireland, North and South."    He added: "It is not for the Government to act as a  persuader  for any particular outcome."</p>

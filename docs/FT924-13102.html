			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Administration undergoes economic pummelling THE Bush administration underwent an economic pummelling yesterday as official figures showed a surge in the trade deficit to Dollars 9bn in August, the biggest shortfall for two years, and a fall in industrial production in September for the second month running. An unexpected slump in exports, which fell 6 per cent in August, was the main cause of the rise in the trade deficit, the Commerce Department said. The production figures confirmed the weakness of the US economy, which some analysts believe is teetering on the brink of a 'triple dip' recession. The slide in exports, meanwhile, indicated that the positive impact on US trade of a weak dollar is now outweighed by the contractionary effects of an increasingly serious global economic slowdown. The export decline was especially embarrassing for President George Bush, who depicted exports as a route to economic salvation in his Thursday night debate with presidential contenders, Mr Bill Clinton and Mr Ross Perot. 'The thing that has saved us in this global economic slowdown has been our exports, and what I am trying to do is increase our exports,' Mr Bush said. In financial markets, bond prices fell, partly on rumours that Mr Clinton is planning an immediate fiscal stimulus if elected on November 3. Some analysts fear that a short-term fiscal stimulus would put upward pressure on long-bond yields, even if balanced by fresh proposals for budget retrenchment in the medium-term. The Dollars 9bn trade deficit was far higher than expected by analysts. The main cause was a broadly-based decline in exports, which fell Dollars 2.3bn to Dollars 35.5bn. This was only partially offset by a Dollars 0.6bn fall in imports to Dollars 44.5bn, reflecting weak US consumer demand. The trade deficit for the first eight months of the year was Dollars 51.9bn, more than 20 per cent higher than in the same period last year, despite a sluggish domestic economy. The Federal Reserve said industrial production fell 0.2 per cent last month, following a 0.4 per cent decline in August. The declines were broadly-based, with significant falls in defence and space equipment, construction supplies and durable materials. Manufacturing output fell 0.4 per cent with durable goods production down 0.7 per cent. Capacity utilisation in manufacturing fell to 77.2 per cent, a full percentage point drop since May. The production figures were the weakest since last winter when the economy was experiencing a second economic dip. While not necessarily implying a contraction of the whole economy, they indicate the sluggish growth of the summer months is petering out.</p>

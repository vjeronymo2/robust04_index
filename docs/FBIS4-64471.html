			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "FDP Is Becoming a Security Risk for </F> Kohl"]    [Text] Lost reputation, the lack of attractiveness, an  ambiguous profile, weak competition -- this is the increasingly  blurred image of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]. In  mid-April Basis Research was commissioned by FOCUS to conduct a  poll of 1,000 western Germans and 500 eastern Germans about  their opinion on the FDP and its representatives. The results  are almost devastating.    The reputation of the FDP has plummeted together with  Ministers Klaus Kinkel, Guenter Rexrodt, Sabine  Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, Karl-Hans Laermann, and Irmgard  Schwaetzer to unprecedented levels in the party's history. A  total of 80 percent of those polled are "completely," "largely,"  or "partly" of the view that the FDP is by far not what it used  to be.    Even though the liberals in Kohl's Cabinet are known to most  people (with the exception of Education Minister Laermann), they  are not convincing. On an approval scale of -\5 to +\5, the  1,500 people polled gave only Klaus Kinkel a relatively  acceptable popularity value with +\1.5. His three colleagues  (Irmgard Schwaetzer was not included in the poll) had to content  themselves with +\0.5 to +\0.7.    A little better but hardly glorious are the marks for  material competence. Here the foreign minister receives +\1.9,  the economics minister +\1.2, and the education minister +\0.9.  Right at the bottom: the justice minister with +\0.7.    Even among those voters who voted for the FDP the  displeasure  with the party leadership cannot be ignored. They mainly  complain that the range of personalities in the FDP has  deteriorated and that the party lacks politicians such as  Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Otto Count Lambsdorff.    Another result of the FOCUS poll, which was held when the  FDP  had not yet made the coalition statement for the benefit of the  Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union, is also  sensational: A total of 68 percent of those polled criticized  the fact that the decision had not yet been made, and 85 percent  were either completely or partly in favor of the FDP committing  itself to the same partner at the federal and at the land level.    Despite this criticism, which is depressing for the FDP,  two-thirds of those polled believe that the FDP will enter the  Bundestag again.</p>

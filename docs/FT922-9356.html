			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Cultural change on training urged MPs URGED a significant cultural change to improve the status of training yesterday. The Commons employment committee made the recommendation in a report containing a broad sweep of conclusions on the employment consequences of sudden industrial change. Evidence was taken from a variety of industrial areas. The committee said British assumptions about manufacturing jobs needed to be overhauled radically. It urged a change in attitude to engineers, entrepreneurs, relocation and career change. 'Some evidence indicates attitudes are already changing to relocation and career change, but more needs to be done to encourage this trend.' The report said companies should regard training as a profitable investment rather than as a cost and criticised government training programmes for not meeting the needs of industry. A serious concern, the report said, was the maintenance of a modern national skills base if the UK was to remain a serious competitor in world markets and improve its international economic standing. The committee commended British Coal Enterprise, a subsidiary of British Coal, and British Steel, for their efforts to create new alternative employment in areas where they made redundancies. It recommended that, where possible, companies that made significant numbers of employees redundant should extend practical help. A report of the committee of public accounts published yesterday said it regarded as 'unacceptable' the accounting procedures that led to more than Pounds 85m being paid for training between 1989 and 1991 without adequate documentation to substantiate claims. The report, which follows a similar one from the National Audit Office, said it was essential that Training and Enterprise Councils, which administer the two main government training schemes, fulfilled their obligations to undertake effective financial monitoring and control. It expected the Department of Employment to apply contractual sanctions and penalties firmly if Tecs failed to meet their obligations.</p>

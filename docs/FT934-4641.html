			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (10): Even the well-educated use this dialect - The mysteries of the Swiss German language An English friend, visiting Zurich for the first time, got off the tram and asked what the big argument had been about: why had her neighbours been shouting? Without realising it, she had been listening to a normal, civil conversation in Swiss German. Zuri Tuutsch, to be precise, is one of many Allemanic dialects in the country. Visitors with some knowledge of German get completely frustrated with these dialects, which seem so close, yet are so far, from proper German. Zurichers politely reply in German if thus spoken to, but among themselves they stick to dialect almost as if they are guarding a 'secret code' to exclude all foreigners. Before the first world war, it was considered a sign of culture in German Switzerland to speak proper German - only the peasants and lower classes spoke dialect with its extraordinarily guttural consonants and singsong tone. Educated Swiss felt themselves to be part of a greater German culture. Two world wars have wrought a radical change in attitudes and the Swiss now have a horror of being mistaken for Germans. Thus, you have the bizarre phenomenon of well-educated German Swiss who can speak virtually unaccented English, French and Italian, but who deliberately put a heavy accent on their German. The code is not that difficult to crack - although it is easier without a foreknowledge of proper German. In Zurich dialect, the 'au' sound, as in ouch, is usually pronounced 'oo' as in boot. 'Ei', as in eye, is pronounced 'ee' as in feel. But if you follow these rules slavishly, you can end up causing much hilarity when you say 'Stoobsooger' for Staubsauger or 'Bleestift' for Bleistift. For no obvious reason, they are pronounced 'Staubsooger' and 'Blaystift'. The suffix 'li', meaning little, gets tacked on to the end of all kinds of unlikely nouns from 'Huusli' (toilet) to 'Guetsli' (biscuit). The past participles in constant use are 'gsii' (gewesen) and 'ghaa' (gehabt). There is a paucity of adjectives, reflecting the fact that this is a purely oral language. Everything from the weather to a meal or a pretty girl will be described as 'schon' (pretty or nice). German speakers should not be surprised if they find it impossible to recognise some words. Some common ones, such as 'Anke', meaning butter, come from other sources. Many French words have been incorporated, such as Billet for ticket and Perron for platform. Merci and Adieu are commonly used. In recent years, as elsewhere, many English words have been borrowed, especially in the youth culture. But the core remains strong. The Swiss will be bellowing 'Gruuezi mitenand' at each other and at visitors for a long time to come.</p>

			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Purchasing Managers See Slowdown: Economic growth slowed in February, easing  inflation pressures that have pushed short-term interest rates to the highest  level in four years, the National Assn. of Purchasing Management said. In its  monthly report based on a survey of purchasing executives at 250 companies, the  trade group said the U.S. economy expanded but at an even slower rate than the  sluggish growth seen in January. The group's leading purchasing management  index was 53% in February, nearly unchanged from 53.2% in January. The previous  low for the index was 52.6% in February, 1987. The index is a composite of new  orders, production, deliveries, inventories and employment.  </P></p>

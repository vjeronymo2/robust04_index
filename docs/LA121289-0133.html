			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> TAIWAN VISITOR KILLED BY GUNMEN  </P> <P> A Taiwanese man who came to the United States to visit his pregnant daughter  was shot and killed when gunmen opened fire in an apparent gang retaliation on  the wrong apartment, authorities said today.  </P> <P> Lin Chin Chuan, 58, died at 8:45 a.m. at County Harbor-UCLA Medical Center  where he had been on life-support systems since he was shot in the head late  Monday night, detective Larry Kallestad said.  </P> <P> Lin and his wife had been in the country only 18 days to be with their daughter  when she gives birth. They were visiting their daughter and her husband.  </P> <P> "The parents had been practicing driving the daughter to the hospital in  anticipation of the imminent birth," Kallestad said.  </P> <P> Police believe that the gunmen were gang members who attacked the wrong  apartment in an apparent retaliatory "hit" for a gang shooting that occurred  nearby about 90 minutes earlier. Three boys, aged 10 to 13, were wounded in the  earlier attack.  </P></p>

The programme demands that by the year 2000 the mortality  rate of pregnant women in these counties be cut by 50 percent  while deaths of children under 5 years old be reduced by  one-third.    The World Bank will loan China $100 million over the next  six  years for the project.    And governments at all levels will match the WB loan in  their  budgets to jump start the joint health project, said Liu  Peilong, Director of the Foreign Loan Office of the Public  Health Ministry.    The project is scheduled to begin this summer. It targets  reducing death rates of mothers and children by expanding and  improving primary health care services in the remote and poor  districts.    The $100 million loan and local matching fund will be used  to  build and improve the village and county health care centres as  well as anti-epidemic institutes.    Grass-roots medical workers will be trained in the latest  methods of treating diseases and preventive health care.    The World Bank and the ministry last week concluded the  first- phase pre-evaluation on the project counties.    Liu said around 300 counties with a population of nearly 1OO  million were selected for the project.    The counties were chosen from Yunnan, Sichuan, Qinghai,  Gansu  Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Guangxi and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.    The Chinese and foreign specialists studied project plans by  examining current health situations in the counties.    The ministry, with help of some international health  organizations and foreign specialists, is compiling teaching  materials to train the local medical workers.    Ministry statistics show that in the poor and remote  counties, the death rate for children is more than 60 per 1,000.  And the maternal mortality rate is more than 200 per 100,000,  yet in some places it can be as high as 1,000 in every 100,000.    The main cause of maternity fatalities is post-delivery  bleeding, accounting for about half of the deaths .    Malnutrition is one of the major causes of the high  mortality  rate of children in the poor counties.</p>

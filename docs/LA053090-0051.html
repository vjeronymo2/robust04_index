			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR NOW, JAY HOWELL GIVES UP STOPPER ROLE  </P> <P> Jay Howell temporarily relinquished his role as the Dodgers' bullpen stopper  Tuesday after a meeting with Manager Tom Lasorda.  </P> <P> Howell said an agreement was reached that the Dodgers would not rush his  comeback as long as he kept them informed of his ability to pitch. Howell had  knee surgery April 24, then had 27 days of inactivity, and has been trying to  come back ever since. The hastened comeback has resulted in stiffness in his  right shoulder.  </P> <P> Howell will probably remain on the major league roster and be used as the 11th  pitcher until his strength returns.  </P> <P> "It might take five innings, it might take 10 innings, I'm close, and I can  finish this rehabilitation program on the major league level," Howell said. "I  just wanted them to know that I'm not 100% yet; and to put me into the kind of  situations that I have been put into lately . . . it's like asking somebody to  drive while they are blind."  </P> <P> Howell has pitched four times, all in pressure situations, since returning to  the active roster May 18. He has two losses during that time while leaving one  game after only two-thirds of an inning because of shoulder stiffness. Summoned  from the bullpen to get the final out Monday, he allowed a walk and a  game-winning single in a 6-5 comeback victory by the Pittsburgh Pirates.  </P> <P> After that game, he complained that his shoulder wasn't ready for such an  appearance. Tuesday, Lasorda heard those complaints.  </P> <P> "I will never, ever subject a player to a situation that he doesn't feel  physically comfortable in," Lasorda said after their meeting. "Even as bad as I  want to win, I will never put a game ahead of a player's health."  </P> <P> Howell admitted that, because of his love for pitching, he may have failed to  properly inform the Dodgers of his inability to pitch at 100%.  </P> <P> "I'm a competitor, I want to be out there, so I'm as much at fault as anybody,"  Howell said. "I'll accept that."  </P></p>

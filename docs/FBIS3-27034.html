Last year some 500 township agroscience and education  centers  were set up in the province.    Now over 2,200 towns have set up such centers, 70 percent of  the total number of towns in Hunan.    The centers play an important role in promoting advanced  farming techniques and training in rural areas.    In 1993 Hunan Province built 251 farm technical training and  demonstration areas based on the centers to introduce 1,057 new  farming techniques and help 200,000 households to get rich.    The use of the new techniques has helped increase  agricultural output value by 450 million yuan.    After learning the techniques of growing elevated gastrodia  tubers over 30 farm households in Linjiang town, in the Tongdao  Dong nationality autonomous county, made an average income of  nearly 20,000 yuan per household only by planting the Chinese  medicinal herb last year.    The farmers' per capita income in Youxian County was over  1,000 yuan after they learned to use new techniques of grain  production, making it one of the richest counties in eastern  Hunan.</p>

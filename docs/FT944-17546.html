			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Kode says bid rumour is 'without foundation' Kode International, the computer services and printed circuit board group, yesterday dismissed rumours that it was the target of a possible takeover bid. Kode denied it was in discussions concerning a bid and said it was unaware of any foundation for the rumours. 'There was a rumour in a couple of newspapers earlier in the week about the possibility of predators lurking. These are completely without foundation,' said Mr Geoff Harvey, finance director. The announcement came after the company's shares rose 7p to 56p on Monday and a further 8p to 64p on Wednesday. However, they closed down 4p at 60p yesterday. Kode lost half its market value in August when it reported interim pre-tax losses of Pounds 515,000 against profits of Pounds 710,000. Turnover was unchanged at Pounds 12.3m. The shares fell 37p to 38p as the company was cautious about its short-term prospects. Its computer services division, DCM Services, was severely affected by the sudden fall in prices of third-party maintenance in the second half of 1993. 'We are happy with the progress on the circuit board side as a whole and are continuing to address the problems in computer services,' Mr Harvey said. Kode acquired DCM in July 1992 for Pounds 3.2m, funded by a rights issue of 3.66m new shares, and was reporting 'fierce' competition by the end of 1993.</p>

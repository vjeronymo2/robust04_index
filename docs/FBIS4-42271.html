			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Addressing a True Path Party  meeting today, party leader and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said  on the Cyprus issue that she held a comprehensive exchange of  views with President Rauf Denktas yesterday. She stressed that  the document of ideas submitted to the two sides by the UN  Security Council on 21 March deviated significantly from the  confidence- building measures previously approved by the  Security Council. Ciller pointed out that progress was made  during the Vienna talks held on 11 and 12 May with a view to  eliminating the deviations. She added: If this understanding  can be translated into written form and confirmed by the United  Nations, then future-oriented steps can be taken.    Ciller stressed that Turkey will support the views to be  posited by Denktas. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: The pitfalls in tax planning - Care is needed if you are to avoid breaching the Revenue's rules MOST PEOPLE would prefer to pay less tax, whether it be on income, capital gains tax or inheritance. But non-declaration is not the solution. This is tax evasion and, if discovered, could result in an assessment for the tax, interest and penalties - or even prison. There are exemptions for each form of tax. For example, personal allowances can be set off against income tax; gains on gifts of private company shares can be deferred; and there is total relief from inheritance tax for agricultural property. You might think that if you could plan your financial affairs to take advantage of these exemptions, you would have to pay less tax. The answer is  -yes, provided you do not try to push the exemptions to extremes. Late in the 1970s, when tax rates went as high as 98 per cent, avoidance was big business. Tax planners became ever more ingenious with every success, with the result that even complex tax avoidance schemes could be bought 'off the peg.' Very often, these involved several steps which had little or no commercial purpose other than to avoid tax, and the taxpayer often had no idea of the legal effect of various steps involved. A series of cases - most notably, Ramsay in 1982 - put a stop to these schemes. In the Ramsay case, the House of Lords decided that the Inland Revenue could treat a tax avoidance scheme involving several steps as a single composite transaction. By ignoring the steps taken in the middle designed to make use of exemptions, the scheme became taxable. As a result, schemes stopped being sold, tax avoidance became a dirty word, and a number of cases were brought to the courts to test the parameters of what became known as the Ramsay principle. It was quickly agreed that the Ramsay principle did not apply to simple tax planning involving only one step. If, for example, you were thinking of providing for your daughter out of your share portfolio while you went to work in Hong Kong, you would be well advised to give her the shares after you had become non-UK resident. Capital gains tax is not payable by non-UK residents (unless there is a specific anti-avoidance provision which specifies to the contrary). What about more complex tax planning making use of several steps? To what extent does the Ramsay principle curtail our freedom to re-arrange our financial affairs to mitigate tax? To give an example of more complex tax planning: there is a relief from CGT for gifts of private company shares, although this is not available if your gift is to a non-UK resident. The residence of a company is defined by where it is managed and controlled, regardless of where the shares are registered. This means that gifts of private company shares to companies incorporated abroad, but managed and controlled in the UK, will still attract relief. A UK resident who is not domiciled in the UK pays CGT or IHT only on UK assets and not on his global assets (so long as the gains are not brought into the UK). Shares are UK assets or non-UK assets, depending on where the company is registered. If, therefore, you have a successful business in the UK which you own through a private company, and you wish to give or sell the shares without CGT or IHT consequences, you could (if you are UK-resident but domiciled elsewhere) first set up a Jersey-registered company managed and controlled by you in the UK. Second, you give your UK shares to your Jersey company and, third, you give or sell your Jersey company shares to someone else. Is this last step free of IHT and CGT consequences, or does the Ramsay principle apply? In short, if you could be sure at the time you took step one that step three would be taken, the answer is that Ramsay would apply and that tax would be payable but, if not, then it would not. For example, if at the time you did the above scheme, you had not identified a purchaser (or, if identified, the buyer was not committed to buying the shares), then the Ramsay principle would probably not apply and tax would not be payable. This principle was applied most recently to inheritance tax in the case of Countess Fitzwilliam v. Inland Revenue. This involved a tailor-made scheme designed to avoid capital transfer tax (the predecessor to IHT) payable on the death of Earl Fitzwilliam. It made use of two exemptions (the reverter to settlor provisions and the mutual transfer provisions) and involved complex strategic tax planning by Countess Fitzwilliam and Lady Hastings, her daughter. The important point in this case was that although the scheme was tailor-made for Countess Fitzwilliam, Lady Hastings had been advised separately and understood precisely what was involved in each step. In his judgment, Lord Keith said the Revenue could not pick and choose from a scheme the bits it liked or did not like, and refuse to apply tax exemptions just because it was a 'pre-planned tax avoidance scheme'. UK tax legislation is among the most sophisticated in the world, with many and clever anti-avoidance provisions, traps and pitfalls. The problem with devising a scheme is that by escaping one tax, you could fall foul of another. This does not mean that strategic tax planning is impossible; far from it. However, it is not advisable unless you can afford good advice, are prepared to take time to understand the details of how and why tax can be avoided, and appreciate fully the risks you are taking.

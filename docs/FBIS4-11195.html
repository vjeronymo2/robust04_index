			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by members of the Salvadoran Supreme Electoral </F> Tribunal, TSE, from the TSE Headquarters at the Hotel Presidente  in San Salvador -- live]    [Text] [TSE President Luis Arturo Zaldivar] We [word  indistinct] announce within the legal framework; that is,  today's elections have been a total success. We Salvadorans  have expressed our absolute respect for the law, and those who  have not done so are now suffering the consequences of their  negative attitude. In that respect, we can tell you that on my  instructions and by virtue of the legal authority I possess as  TSE president, the National Civilian Police arrested Jose  Antonio Ramirez in Jucuapa Municipality, Usulutan Department.  Ramirez was arrested when members of voting table boards No.  4,205 and 4,214 in Jucuapa confirmed that he committed fraud by  voting twice.    The elections have taken place in an orderly fashion. The  other TSE magistrates will now give you further details.    [TSE Magistrate Jaime Romero Ventura] The logistical  measures  taken by the TSE to ensure the success of this electoral event  are as follows: There was free movement of individuals and  vehicles. There were selective checks of individuals entering  polling stations. Thus there was security but voters were able  to move about unimpeded. We increased the number of polling  stations at a national level, especially in the capital. The  number of voting table boards per polling station was reduced,  thus allowing the elections to be held in an easy, rapid manner.  The voters were able to move about with greater flexibility.  In conclusion, we had an effective sign system that helped  voters find their voting tables quickly.    [Unidentified magistrate] In addition to the measures to  which Magistrate Romero Ventura has referred, the TSE worked to  assist voters by issuing the necessary publications to locate  and identify polling centers by number and letter to help voters  find them more quickly. We published a list for each polling  station with the first and last names of all voters to help them  find their voting table. We set up a telephone information line  so citizen could call and ask questions about the voting  process. We arranged free urban and rural transportation. We  also obtained the cooperation of the transportation  organizations, which allowed the normal flow of traffic on  election day. We also tried to create an information system  through information centers at principal polling stations and  with the cooperation of the participating political parties to  help voters find their tables so they could exercise their  sacred right to vote.    These are some of the measures that contributed to the  success of today's elections.    [Zaldivar] As we begin this initial report issued by the  TSE, we must first recognize the efforts of all our personnel,  who have unselfishly gone out to complete the many tasks this  election day has required. It is an honor to state that TSE  personnel did their work enthusiastically both during the first  election and now during this run-off election. The TSE would  also like to recognize the National Civilian Police, which, in  conjunction with the TSE, provided security for the election  process. They also provided security in those places where the  National Police had no personnel for the elections. We must  also recognize the cooperation of other government agencies,  such as the Education Ministry. Without their help we would not  have been able to improve the distribution of the polling  stations across the country. In this same vein, we received  assistance from the Agricultural Development Bank and the  Association of Architects of El Salvador, who helped us with the  signs and distribution at the voting stations as well as with  posters, shelves, and so on.    We must also recognize that we have had the assistance of  the  Salvadoran Air Force, which will make it easier to bring you the  results. We also give special recognition to the assistance we  have had from international organizations such as USAID, the  Electoral Advice and Promotion Center [CAPEL], several UN  organizations, and the group of friends of El Salvador, who have  all made enormous contributions to the success of this process.    [Romero] People of El Salvador, I will now address that  pertaining to the preliminary and final tallying process.  Regarding the preliminary results, we would like to state that  the TSE is ready to gather and process the information and  announce the results quite quickly. We have set up an entire  logistical structure for that purpose. Just as in the 20 March  elections, we have TSE representatives in each of the 262  municipalities throughout the country who will gather the  tallying sheets immediately. We will gather the information via  fax from 220 of the 262 municipalities that have less than 36  voting stations. This information must be sent to us by the  municipal electoral board, which groups all the voting stations  in the municipality. We will receive the information  immediately. The information can be here in a minute.    We will collect each of the other 42 municipalities' voting  station tally sheets and bring them to the Hotel Presidente by  land or by air, thanks to the assistance of the Air Force  helicopter. The Agricultural Promotion Bank's fleet of vehicles  has been very useful in this task.    We have the computer equipment to tally and immediately  process all the vote count certificates we receive. It is up to  the voting table boards and the Municipal Election Boards made  up of the representatives of the participating political party  and coalition to provide us with that information. Once we  receive that information, we will be able to immediately report  the results. I must inform you that at this hour, at 1900, we  are already receiving some vote count certificates via fax. The  time to begin transmitting news briefs as well as the amount of  information we may provide will depend on the Municipal Election  Board and the voting table boards. We are prepared and trained  to provide such information immediately. Moreover, we have  drafted the instructions for the final vote count, which  basically state the following:    The TSE, in agreement with ARENA [Nationalist Republican  Alliance] and the CD-FMLN [Democratic Convergence-Farabundo  Marti National Liberation Front] coalition, has decided that the  TSE will be responsible for conducting the final vote count as  stated in the electoral code. The final vote count will be  based on vote count certificates from the voting table boards  and the Municipal Election Boards. The figures we receive  during the preliminary vote count will serve as a guide. The  objective we have for the final vote count is to inform the  people of the results of the presidential and vice presidential  elections in an accurate and timely manner.    To achieve this, we have a procedure for how the final vote  count will take place. Three members of the Departmental  Election Board, two ARENA representatives, two CD-FMLN coalition  representatives, a delegate from the Attorney General's Office,  an Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] observer, a table  executive appointed by the TSE, a visiting technician appointed  by the TSE, and, in San Salvador Department, two technicians and  a secretary appointed by the TSE will participate in the final  vote count.    The table executive will be a member of the TSE and will be  appointed from among our personnel. They will be in charge of  managing and coordinating the working tables. These working  tables will begin work on Tuesday, 26 April, from 0800 to 1200,  from 1400 to 1800, and from 2000 to 2400 every day. The  procedure will be to make an inventory, municipality by  municipality, of the original vote count certificates from the  voting table boards and the Departmental Election Board as well  as from those in the hands of ARENA, the CD-FMLN coalition, and  the Attorney General's Office. This will allow us to have an  accurate knowledge of all the information. We are going to  initiate the vote count, municipality by municipality, in order.  We are going to draft a form for the data received from the  voting table boards. This form must be signed by the table  members and the representatives of the Attorney General's  Office. Once this form is signed, we will conduct the  appropriate [word indistinct] and if the table members want a  partial copy of the results, they can have it. Once the data  received from the voting table boards is processed, we will  release the information received from each voting table board  and the total for each municipality. A copy in diskette of the  municipal figures will be entered into a computer that will give  us the national total. Once the vote count per department is  completed, we are going to release the departmental total. The  TSE will learn about the totals of the various municipalities  and of the departments once the results are approved by the  Departmental Election Board. The results will be turned over to  the table executive, a member of the TSE.    Requests for recounts of ballot boxes as approved by the  Departmental Election Board will be turned over to the TSE,  which will initiate the steps to review the situation and  determine if the review is valid or not. That is how we will do  the final vote count.    [Zaldivar] The TSE wishes to express its recognition of the  civic spirit and democratic calling demonstrated by our dear  Salvadoran people. We also want to recognize the work done by  participating political parties, both in the first round and in  these run-off elections. We also call on the media to respect  the law and refrain from giving election results before the TSE  gives its results [three-second break in reception]. Finally,  we want to make an urgent call to members of the Municipal  Election Boards and members of the voting table boards to allow  our TSE delegates to pick up copies of the vote count  certificates and send them to us through the previously  established channels. When this is done we will be able to  inform the national and international community of the results  of this historic event in our dear country.    Salvadoran people, good evening.</p>

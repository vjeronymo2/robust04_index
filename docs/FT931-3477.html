			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Arts: Arditti String Quartet - Concert On Sunday the Purcell Room was packed for the Arditti's third recital (of four, concluding this Friday) in their survey of Schoenberg and his associates. Reporting on the first, Andrew Clements wrote here that their ultra-assured playing disclosed too little searching passion; but this time they warmed to their task at once, to much more exciting effect. They began with Webern's sole 'twelve-note' quartet, op. 28. With its spare, intricate, serenely unfolding patterns, it is not obviously a thing to stir the blood - but the composer's rigorous economy has potent charms. A performance so attentive as the Arditti's was to paragraphing and natural breathing, to balance and to the vital nodes of the music, cannot but re-create Webern's original passion for combining abstract inquiry with precise appreciation of string-sound. Everything told; it was a clairvoyant account, and one to remind us why Webern's later music struck a postwar generation of composers with more revelatory force than Schoenberg's own. For contrast the Arditti threw in Webern's 1906 'Rondo", a recent exhumation and a loquacious, skittery exercise in chromatics which shows what Webern - and Alban Berg too - might have stuck at, had their individual passion for deeper organisation (and Schoenberg's own stern example) not propelled them onward. Hearing Schoenberg's 1927 Third Quartet next made the point vividly. Post-tonal writing could aspire to a Beethovenian density, but only if its defining rules were as tough as Beethoven's period-tonal ones had been. This Third, like Bartok's Fourth, used to have a reputation for pursuing an ideal of the New all too single-mindedly (where their later quartets were supposed to aim at friendlier compromises). The Arditti performance proved that intelligent loyalty to the new plan can attain complete expressive conviction without cheating, without falling back upon stock Romantic echoes. That bracing result was only slightly compromised, after the interval, by the Arditti's coolly rapturous account of Schoenberg's Verklarte Nacht sextet (with two distinguished guests from the Alban Berg Quartet). Might it be a precondition for playing later Schoenberg so well that the players must have fathomed earlier Schoenberg, post-Romantic but pre-'dodecaphonic', with such sympathy? From the start of the 1899 sextet, where the Arditti turned the usual thick bass-swells into hard, doomy throbs, thus sharpening the drama of the piece immeasurably, it was clear that this 'Transfigured Night' would be freshly transfigured. And it was: the later contrapuntal strife transparently argued, the apotheosis made luminous by professional care for the notes, without super-added sentiment. Before and after his single-handed musical revolution, Schoenberg earned just such searching executive attention - but inspired champions of the Arditti order have been few and far between.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Program purpose, goals, and objectives:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Administration on Children Youth and Families will award approximately 150 new service grants to establish or strengthen existing or proposed runaway and homeless youth Basic Centers. These programs must be locally controlled efforts that provide temporary shelter, counseling and other services to juveniles who have left home without permission of their parents or guardians or to other homeless juveniles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications are solicited under this priority area to carry out direct service projects designed to carry out the program purpose, goals and objectives set forth in the legislation and as specified in Part I, section C.1 of this announcement. These goals and objectives are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. To alleviate the problems of runaway and homeless youth,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. To reunite youth with their families and to encourage the resolution of intrafamily problems through counseling and other services,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. To strengthen family relationships and to encourage stable relationships for youth, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. To help youth decide upon constructive courses of action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Background:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Runaway Youth and Homeless Youth Act was enacted in response to widespread concern regarding the alarming number of youth who were leaving home without parental permission, crossing State lines, and who, while away from home, were exposed to exploitation and other dangers of street life.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each Basic Center funded under the authorizing legislation is required to provide outreach to runaway and homeless youth; temporary shelter for up to fifteen days; food; clothing; individual, group, and family counseling; and related services. Many Basic Centers provide their services in residential settings with a capacity for no more than 20 youth. Some centers also provide some or all of their shelter services through host homes (usually private homes under contract to the centers), with counseling and referrals being provided from a central location.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, approximately 60,000 youth annually receive shelter for an average of 12 nights and other ongoing services through ACYF-funded Basic Centers. The primary presenting problems of these youth include conflict with parents or other adults, including physical and sexual abuse (63 percent); other family crises such as divorce, death, or sudden loss of income (9 percent); and personal problems such as drug use, or problems with peers, school attendance and truancy, bad grades, inability to get along with teachers, and learning disabilities (28 percent).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Low self-esteem is a major problem among this population. Half (49 percent) have a poor self image; somewhat less than half (43 percent) are depressed; and 12 percent are possibly suicidal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After receiving ongoing services from shelter programs, 50 percent of the youth return to their families. One-third (33 percent) are provided alternative, but safe, long-term living arrangements. Five percent return to the streets, and 12 percent leave the centers with no known destination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Minimum requirements for project design:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As part of addressing the evaluation criteria outlined in Part II of this announcement, each applicant must address the following items in the program narrative section of the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Objectives and Need for Assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

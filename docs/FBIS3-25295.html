			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by Mangosuthu Buthelezi, president of the </F> IFP, on the SAPA PR wire service on 13 February]    [Text] The minister of constitutional development, Mr Roelf  Meyer, was reported yesterday as having stated that the Freedom  Alliance [FA] has been shifting the goal posts and ought to  clarify its ideas by submitting detailed proposals for  constitutional amendments.    If these reported statements are true in their substance  South Africa is facing a situation that can only be expressed in  terms of astonishment, outrage and profound indignation. The  IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], as well as the Freedom Alliance,  has constantly negotiated within the parameters of written  documentation tabled with our counterparts. Such documentation  reflected the mandates received by the respecting governing  bodies of the IFP and the Freedom Alliance. At no time have the  negotiators ever advanced any demands which were not contained  in such documentation.    Furthermore, the analysis of our documentation submitted  with  the South African Government since July 2, 1993 when the IFP and  other members of the Freedom Alliance walked out of the World  Trade Centre, clearly indicates that we constantly reduced our  proposals. Our final proposals contained in the December 19,  1993 document known as the yellow paper were substantially  agreed upon with government and reflected over two months of  very intensive negotiations.    No proposal was advanced over and above what is contained in  the yellow paper. The contrary is true, for our negotiating  team on several occasions showed a great deal of flexibility  departing from the principles and positions contained in the  yellow paper. This is particularly true with reference to the  powers of the provinces set out in Section 126, the fiscal  autonomy of the provinces set out in Sections 155-159, the role  of the senate, the provisions of rationalisation, the entire  chapter on deadlock-breaking mechanisms, the issues of  provincial civil service and police, the functions of local  government and many other issues covered by the yellow paper.    Negotiations broke down on a clear and cynical either/or  tabled by SACP [South African Communist Party] chairman, Joe  Slovo. He indicated that either the Freedom Alliance had to  accept two conditions or further negotiations would be futile.  The two conditions were that provinces could not have any  degree of power which the central government could not also  exercise in its own name, and that no limit could be put on the  discretion of the constituent assembly to reconsider the powers,  functions and boundaries of provinces.    What I do not understand is how and why our free media of  communication does not challenge the repeated accusations by  Minister Meyer that we have been shifting the goal posts. Why  is there no investigative journalism which can analyse whether  there is any merit in such an accusation? Why does nobody ask  themselves how we can be more detailed and specific in our  constitutional proposals after we went to the extent of drafting  a complete set of constitutional amendments which were  introduced in parliament? These are challenges that our media of  public communication should undertake for the sake of freedom in  this country.</p>

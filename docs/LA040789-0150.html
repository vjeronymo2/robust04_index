			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE  </P> <P> Housing construction is getting off to a rather anemic start in the county this  year.  </P> <P> Local governments in February issued building permits for only 452  single-family houses. A year ago it was 530, and that was down from 591 in  February, 1987.  </P> <P> Apartments and condos were down, too, but not as much. February's permits  totalled 401, compared to 429 last year and 504 the year before.  </P> <P> Land in the county is getting more scarce and more expensive, and housing  consultants suggest that builders are more cautious this year because a  slowdown in sales is expected.  </P> <P> By far the largest number of permits -- 490, for all types of housing -- was  issued during the month in the unincorporated southern half of Orange County.  </P> <P> Somewhat surprisingly, the small city of Garden Grove was second with 76  multifamily units approved.

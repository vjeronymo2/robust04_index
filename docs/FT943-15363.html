			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / UK may relax curbs on beef sales The British government is discussing easing the controls on beef cattle sales that were introduced four years ago in response to the epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy - mad cow disease. The move came as Germany's 16 federal states voted in favour of an immediate, unilateral six-month ban on selective imports of British beef yesterday. Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK agriculture minister, would need Brussels' approval for any lifting of export restrictions on live cattle. However, it is a particularly sensitive time to start asking for an easing of controls as the German and French governments are pressing for a clampdown on British beef shipments. The Bundesrat, the German upper house of parliament, demanded that the beef ban be put into effect 'without delay' by Mr Horst Seehofer, health minister, although European Commission rules would normally delay such a move between three and 12 months. The import ban would affect all beef from cattle more than three years old, or from herds that have not been certified free of BSE for at least four years. It is not clear how quickly Mr Seehofer will act on the measure. A health ministry official said he would wait for a response from Brussels. The Commission's veterinary committee will discuss its response to calls for an European Union-wide ban on Monday. If the Commission fails to take new measures, Mr Seehofer has clearly reserved the right to act unilaterally, arguing that the protection of public health must take precedence over EU notification guidelines. Agriculture ministry officials point out that the number of cases of BSE reported in the UK in the first six months of the year has dropped by 23 per cent compared with the same period last year. The number of cattle to have contracted the disease this year is 17,637 out of a total herd of 4.5m.</p>

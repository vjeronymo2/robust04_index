			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Management: Sights set on a new target - James Buxton describes how moving factory has helped to rejuvenate Barr &amp; Stroud Tom O'Neill, managing director of Barr &amp; Stroud, points to an L-shaped stretch of desk space, indistinguishable from any other in an open plan office. 'That's where I sit,' he says proudly. He adds: 'It was only when I said that was where I was going to work that other senior executives accepted the idea of not having their own offices.' Barr &amp; Stroud, which makes equipment such as gunsights, periscopes and rangefinders mainly for the defence industry, is claiming success in breaking away from what O'Neill admits were the grossly inefficient management and production methods of its past. In common with other defence subcontractors the company is having to face up to the competitive challenge posed by the ending of the cold war, and by changes in the old cosy relationship with its customers. What makes its experience unusual, however, is the galvanising effect which re-locating to new premises appears to have had on the bottom line. The move to a large, airy new factory in Glasgow - in which office space merges into manufacturing areas - has helped Barr &amp; Stroud over the last couple of years cut its production lead times from 15 months to seven months, and raise the percentage of products delivered on time from a slovenly 10 per cent to 90 per cent. Last year it made an operating profit of Pounds 1.3m, its first since the late 1980s. O'Neill admits that Barr &amp; Stroud, owned 50-50 by Pilkington and the French company Thomson, was a product of the 'featherbedded' defence industry, operating on cost-plus contracts. Before the move it was housed in Edwardian plants in Anniesland, Glasgow. Initial efforts at transforming the company through computerisation faltered in the face of ingrained structures. 'With computerisation alone the company would just have been automating inefficiency,' according to Mike Ward of Andersen Consulting, which came in to advise Barr &amp; Stroud on its transformation. Just as the company realised it needed more sweeping changes, however, it sold its old site to Safeway for Pounds 14.5m and was able to commission a new Pounds 20m plant, designed by the architects Ryder Nicklin. The reorganisation could consequently start again from scratch. 'The move opened people's minds,' says O'Neill. 'They suddenly said: 'Why can't we do this or that?' We wouldn't have made half the productivity gains we've achieved if we'd stayed where we were.' The new factory, at Linthouse on the banks of the Clyde, employs 700 people, compared with the 2,100 who worked at Anniesland. Yet turnover between the years to March 1990 and March 1993 has gone down proportionately less than the workforce, falling from Pounds 62m to Pounds 52m. From the start the company told staff it wanted to cut 800 jobs and achieve a single status factory, in which the main differential between employees would be their salary level. That meant reducing nine tiers of management to four, scrapping the six different grades of canteen in favour of one. Not surprisingly, says O'Neill, 'the biggest opposition to change came from middle management, because they were the group most threatened and were going to be decimated - what was happening really threatened their comfort zone'. O'Neill fired 22 of the 40 senior executives in early 1990 soon after taking over as managing director, 'people who were not going to get on the train in the direction we were going'. He says he spelt out frankly to the workforce what was intended. 'We gave them the bad news about the job losses first, then we listened to their ideas. If people don't take ownership of change, they won't change their behaviour.' Instead of the old hierarchical structure staff now work in 12 teams, each dedicated to specific projects. These include a civilian version of the company's thermal imaging equipment, used for spotting objects and people in the dark, which Barr &amp; Stroud is selling to police forces. Each team includes designers, production planners, materials purchasers and production controllers. Staff report to a team leader, rather a middle manager such as the head of the machine shop as they would have done previously. The four tiers of management consist of the managing director (O'Neill), the operations director (Lawrie Rumens), the team leaders and everyone else, from machinist to receptionist. Rumens believes that as Barr &amp; Stroud moves closer to its medium-term goal of achieving full computer integrated manufacturing, his job will disappear, reducing the four tiers to three. Barr &amp; Stroud says a system under which seven trade unions each had negotiating rights has been reduced to a single bargaining group Barr &amp; Stroud has cut 1,400 jobs from its workforce in three big waves of redundancies and early retirement. The management dropped a compulsory redundancy programme after a two-day strike in late 1991 and all redundancies have been voluntary. Stewart Ritchie, convener for the AEEU engineer's union, says the employees like the new working arrangements. The management, he says 'are far more open than they used to be about what's going on'. The other big change which contributed strongly to cutting the workforce and the size of the company's operations was the switch to outsourcing most of its manufacturing. Here again, the move to new premises was an important catalyst. In the old factory Barr &amp; Stroud used to be vertically integrated, producing much of the metalwork and most of the electronic components for its products. 'We decided our strength was in designing and making systems,' says O'Neill. 'We wanted to concentrate on that and buy in the rest.' The machine shop was slimmed down to 30 people from 200, and the same staff reduction was achieved by the electronics section. Most electronic components are now made or assembled by the US company Hughes Microelectronics at Glenrothes, Fife, while optical components come from Pilkington Optronics' plant at St Asaph in North Wales. Machining is done by a company in the Isle of Man. Now only 23 suppliers account for 60 per cent of all inputs - three years ago the company had more than 3,000 suppliers. By simplifying the manufacturing operation, stocks and work in progress have fallen from Pounds 22m to Pounds 7m.</p>

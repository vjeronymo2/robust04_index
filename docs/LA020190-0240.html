			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COUNTERPOINT;  </P> <P> STEINBRENNER SAYS FANS WILL BALK AT SALARIES  </P> <P> George Steinbrenner, the man who built World Series champions in the late 1970s  with pricey free agents, agrees with other baseball owners on one subject --  that players' salaries are getting too high.  </P> <P> "It's just getting crazy.  </P> <P> Shocked? Yes. Certainly," the New York Yankees owner was quoted in the New York  Daily News. "How can you pay a ballplayer 3, 3 1/2-million dollars a year when  the head of the Chiefs of Staff is making just $77,000 a year?"  </P> <P> "Some way, somehow, someone has to say, 'Stop! Whoa!' Can one man make a  $3-million difference in a ballclub. I don't know."  </P> <P> The Yankees do not have a $3-million player yet, although Don Mattingly is  entering the final season of a three-year contract and would like an extension  for at least that much.  </P> <P> The Yankees did, however, sign free agent Pascual Perez to a three-year,  $5.7-million contract. Perez was 9-13 for Montreal last season and is 64-62  lifetime.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner predicted the fans will eventually rebel against the higher  salaries.  </P> <P> "It will probably be the cab drivers or the cops," he said. "The fans. They'll  say, 'enough is enough.' They'll realize a ballplayer will make more in one  year than him and 10 of his friends will make in their lives."  </P></p>

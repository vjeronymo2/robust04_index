			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by KHOVAR news agency for TASS] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe 3 June TASS -- An unspecified number of  Tajik opposition militants was killed in a major two-day  military operation conducted by Russian frontier troops in the  Central Asian republic. Nobody among the Russian military was  injured, according to the headquarters of the Russian border  guards in Tajikistan.    It said that during the operation held on 31 May and 1 June  the troops combed the areas adjoining the Pyandzh section of the  Tajik-Afghan border to neutralise opposition militants of the  so-called "Pyandzh-Kumsangir front." The militants often  shelled Russian border posts and mined border areas.    The headquarters also said that opposition militants are  concentrating on the Afghan territory in the villages of Andzhiz  and Yalur close to the section of the Moskovskiy border  detachment. The military warned that they may fire on the  opposition strongholds on Afghan territory to suppress the  militants if the latter attack Russian border guards or Tajik  government forces. "Adequate measures will be taken. Enemy  strongholds will be eliminated regardless of their place of  location," the military said.</p>

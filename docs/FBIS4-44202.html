			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Henri Vernet: "Two Months Ago, the French Left </F> Kigali, Why Are They Returning Now?"]    [Text] Everyone is aware that an intervention, if not as  hazardous as some would have us believe, will be far from a mere  formality: The Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which now  controls almost the whole country, has clearly threatened to  treat French soldiers as "enemies." On a political level,  things are just as volatile, as the RPF's many international  backers (among others, English-speaking African countries and,  in Europe, the Belgians) will no doubt charge Paris with  "rescuing the perpetrators of the genocide" by saving the  supporters of the late [President] Habyarimana's regime from  certain defeat.    In short, the feeling elicited by France's sudden  interventionism or, more to the point, the determination of the  occasional Mitterrand-Juppe tandem, however laudable it may seem  from a "moral" point of view, is one of bafflement. All the  more when one recalls how frantically the staff of the French  Embassy in Kigali scrambled to leave two month ago. "A  veritable exodus," as put by one observer, who still cannot  fathom why our diplomats should have felt the need to burn their  files, "as though it were the Germans invading Paris!"    What shameful deeds did the French need to bury? And could  it be that they are now acting on a desire to make amends?  While the very nature of such a hypothesis makes it difficult  to ascertain, it cannot be dismissed out of hand. Having  supported Habyarimana's dictatorial regime (whose exactions  against the Tutsi minority as well as democratic-minded Hutus  has been amply confirmed) for years, France was obviously  instrumental in bringing about today's tragedy.    Whatever the Elysee [office of the president], the Quai  d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry], and the Cooperation Ministry may say  about the "pivotal role" of our diplomats in the Arusha  reconciliation agreement signed in August 1993, there are facts  that will not go away. Until he was assassinated, more than  eight months after Arusha, Juvenal Habyarimana consistently  attempted to block the implementation of the agreement. A ploy  to weaken his rivals, a prime example being the RPF, had been  successful: The president and his aides had cunningly favored,  in almost every region of the country, the emergence of tiny  political parties, all of which had their own demands, thus  making any national dialogue a very sensitive matter. According  to regional experts, this strategy had obviously been  "masterminded by French advisers."    Denounced by both national and foreign media for weeks,  France is now allegedly trying to improve its standing through  humanitarian action. Here, another explanation springs to mind.  The U.S. experience in Somalia (that is, before operation  "Restore Hope" degenerated into tragic surrealism) shows that  humanitarian action works wonders on a country's public opinion.  Especially when the latter, as has been the case with Rwanda  for several weeks now, has been fed a steady diet of unbearable  pictures and mind-boggling casualty figures.    The case for such an explanation becomes even stronger in  the  light of an internal strife which has been going on in France:  [former Humanitarian Minister] Bernard Kouchner went to Rwanda  several times -- not ineffectively since his indignant calls did  shake up many a slumbering conscience in France. On the  government side, while Health Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy did  visit border refugee camps once, the government had long kept a  low profile (need one mention the nonentity that is Kouchner's  successor as humanitarian minister: Lucette Michaux-Blazy?).  According to Pierre-Marie Decoudras, a Black Africa Study  Center (CEAN) researcher, the "Kouchner syndrome has obviously  had a lot to do with" Alain Juppe's gung-ho stance.    It also influenced Francois Mitterrand's stance, although an  additional motive for the latter is likely to be the close  friendship he maintained with Rwanda's assassinated president,  with whom Mr. Mitterrand's son Jean-Christophe was close as  well. Indeed, it was because of such "loyalty" that  Habyarimana's widow and her family were flown away in one of the  first Transall transport aircraft used to evacuate French  nationals from Kigali after the more fanatical Hutus started the  slaughter.    "The other, more traditional syndrome to be considered is  the  `Fachoda syndrome' [location in Upper Volta which was ceded to  the British in 1899]," adds Pierre-Marie Decoudras. In this  region of Africa, countries such as Rwanda, Burundi, the Central  African Republic, and Zaire are on the edge of the Anglo-Saxon  sphere of influence, a prominent member of the latter being  Uganda, which has traditionally and overtly supported the RPF  rebels. And at a time when Zaire is being undermined from  within and the political situation in Bangui [Central African  Republic] -- the very pivot of French military operations in  Africa -- appears shaky, France is bent on salvaging what  remains to be salvaged in Rwanda, and therefore also in  neighboring Burundi, another country which has always straddled  the fence. Furthermore, all this should not be too difficult to  achieve after all. "Remember the small number of French  soldiers it took to stop the RPF's offensive against Kigali one  and a half year ago," Decoudras points out. "Things have not  changed all that much since, and I believe that the RPF and the  French will necessarily need to compromise. All told, this  should indeed be a successful military and humanitarian  operation." In other words, not such a bad deal for France,  whose latest noteworthy action in Africa was the devaluation of  the CFA [African Financial Community] franc, and which therefore  could use the goodwill its "benevolent" intervention might earn  it.</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / German union votes to strike in east IG METALL, Germany's powerful engineering union, won overwhelming support yesterday for the first official strikes in eastern Germany for more than 60 years. More than 86 per cent of eastern German steel employees affiliated to IG Metall voted for strike action, which may start next week. The vote was equally overwhelming among metal and electrical workers in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, and Saxony, the only two states balloted for the sector. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the union's president, said the vote showed that 'all dreams had died that IG Metall might not be prepared to fight in east Germany'. Gesamtmetall, the metal and electrical employers association, said higher wages, coupled with low productivity, would 'dry up investment. This is economically suicidal'. Mr Herbert Hax, one of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's special economic advisers, said: 'In the end, this (strike) would lead to a decline in investment, which is urgently needed for rebuilding east Germany.' Arbeitgeberverband Stahl, the steel employers' association, said IG Metall was 'using eastern German workers as a means of boosting its flagging support and power in the west'. By using the threat of a strike, IG Metall wants to reinstate a contract, ended last month by the employers, which would have equalised eastern and western German wages by April 1994. The union says the employers broke the contract not for economic reasons but to end the postwar system of collective wage bargaining. The employers deny this. The contract would have obliged employers to pay wage increases this year of more than 20 per cent to the metal, electrical and steel sectors. The employers are recommending about 9 per cent, matching the region's annual inflation rate. Eastern German wages are about 70 per cent of western German levels, but productivity lags behind western Germany by as much as 70 per cent. IG Metall, clearly encouraged by the outcome of the ballot, will hold a special meeting today to decide where and when to hold the strikes. They might start as early as May 3, but some of the employers' associations are hoping the deadlock can be broken this weekend. A meeting, called by the metal and electrical employers, will be held with IG Metall tomorrow in the eastern state of Thuringia, even though the union has repeatedly said it would negotiate only if employers reinstated the contract. The union said: 'This is not a real negotiation. In any case, wage policy is made in Frankfurt' - IG Metall's federal headquarters. Gesamtmetall said Cologne - its headquarters - would determine the status of the meeting. However, an official of the steel employers said the meeting might move towards a compromise: 'IG Metall cannot admit it is dropping its preconditions.'</p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Yeltsin defied as deputies' militancy grows Russia's lower house of parliament yesterday failed to pass the 1994 budget at a third reading and came out strongly against President Boris Yeltsin's decree against crime as it 'seriously limits the constitutional rights and liberties of Russian citizens'. The votes, together with a swell of protest against proposals from Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, leader of the upper house and an ally of Mr Yeltsin, to prolong the terms of both the parliament and the president by two years without election, marks a sudden militancy in a body which has been relatively restrained in its six-month life. The ground on which it is preparing to fight - that of the constitution - is similar to that on which Mr Yeltsin and the previous parliament divided and ultimately fought. The difference this time is that the constitution is Mr Yeltsin's creation. The vote on the budget, which had been expected to go through after two lower house readings in which it gained large majorities, followed its rejection by the upper house earlier this week. The upper house had demanded an increase in military spending in the budget from Rbs37,500bn to Rbs55,000bn, following sustained lobbying by the military and military industry. A large majority of deputies voted for the budget but failed to secure the required 225 votes. Between 215 and 220 voted in favour, with 43 against and 60 abstaining. There was overwhelming support - 246 against 6 - for a resolution calling on Mr Yeltsin to withdraw his decree announced last week 'on urgent measures to protect the citizenry against banditry and organised crime'. The size of the majority shows that opposition to the unconstitutional nature of the decree has spread across all parties. Mr Viktor Ilyukhin, a leading member of the Communist faction, said it broke as many as eight articles of the constitution, while Mr Boris Fyodorov, reformist leader of the Liberal Democratic Union, said that 'until the government and president obey their own laws and its own constitution we will not have reform here'. The decree allows for a suspect to be held without charge for 30 days, against the 48-hour limit specified by the constitution.</p>

			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The widow of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, questioned directly by the man  convicted of killing her husband, said there is no chance he is innocent.  "Unfortunately, there is no doubt," Lisbeth Palme said at an appeals hearing in  Stockholm. She identified Christer Pettersson as the only person in sight on  the downtown street corner where Palme was shot to death on the night of Feb.  28, 1986. Pettersson, who has repeatedly denied that he was near the site of  the slaying, was convicted in July. The appellate hearing, which began Sept.  11, has largely been a rehash of trial testimony.  </P></p>

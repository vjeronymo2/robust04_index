			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] As of noon today, the Kakh and Kahana Hay  movements were declared terror organizations according to the  Antiterror Act. According to the government's declaration,  support for these movements, activity within them, and even  solidarity with them, are offenses which entail a prison  penalty. This is what Attorney General Mikha'el Ben-Ya'ir said  at the end of the meeting:    [Begin Ben-Ya'ir recording] [passage omitted] The  government has decided that due to the danger involved in the  activity of members of these organizations, there is no choice  now but to infringe on the basic democratic liberties of people  who belong in or are associated with, or identify with, these  movements, and to decide on declaring these organizations as  terroristic ones.    Membership in an organization which has been declared  terroristic; playing a role in such an organization; extending  verbal, practical, or financial support to such an organization;  or expressing solidarity with it, will all be considered an  offense which entails an imprisonment penalty. The above is  according to Articles 2, 3, and 4 of the Antiterror Act. The  property of the organizations can be confiscated by the state,  according to Article 5 of this Act. According to Article 6 of  this Antiterror Act, Israel Police's inspector general can  decide on the closure of places which serve terrorist  organizations or their members as a place of storage or as a  basis of activity, meeting, or propaganda, be it regularly or on  occasion.    The government gave due consideration to the significance of  its decision from the viewpoint of infringing on or curtailing  basic democratic liberties such as the freedom of association,  the freedom of movement, and others, but viewed itself compelled  to adopt this decision because of the activity of these  movements and their members. [end recording]    The cabinet ministers adopted Ben-Ya'ir's recommendation  unanimously, but stressed nevertheless, that the decision was  not easy. The ministers demand that the decision be enforced,  and that the radical settlers be disarmed and removed from  places of friction in the territories. Our political  correspondent Udi Segal reports from the Prime Minister's Office:    This evening or tomorrow the attorney general will relay  clear operational guidelines to the Shin Bet and the police,  according to the government's declaration on Kakh and Kahana Hay  as terror organizations. Imprisonment is the sentence facing  every member of these organizations, as well as any person who  supports them verbally, practically, or financially. Justice  Minister David Liba'i clarifies that the decision will not  enable the members of Kakh and Kahana Hay to play games with the  police and act under a different name. [passage omitted]    The ministers demand a rapid implementation of the decision  now. Minister Yosi Sarid demands that special mechanisms be  established in the Shin Bet, the Justice Ministry, and the  police, with their sole duty being that of monitoring the  implementation of the decision. Ministers Rubinstein and Tzur  demand that the radical settlers be disarmed right away, removed  from the territories, and banned from military reserves service.  This is first and foremost a moral decision, the cabinet  ministers said. This is an extreme move which was difficult for  me to vote on, said Minister Moshe Shahal, while Minister  Shetrit explained that the cabinet's action was one of no  choice. [passage omitted]    The cabinet meeting ended only about 30 minutes ago, and  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin will leave tomorrow, carrying a  drastic government decision, declaring Kakh and Kahana Hay  terrorist organizations.    [Later on in the IDF evening newsreel, Police Minister Moshe  Shahal says that the Israel Police has information about  "several hundred up to a few thousand" people. Still,  everything depends on the guidelines the police receive from the  attorney general, and a decision on action will be made  according to collected evidence; those who committed "concrete  offenses" and against whom there is sufficient evidence will be  brought to trial.]</p>

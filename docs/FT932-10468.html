			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / UK Company News: OGC flotation and placing give Pounds 78m valuation SHARES offered in the flotation of OGC International, an Aberdeen-based contractor which provides construction and project management services to oil and gas companies in the North Sea, have been priced at 130p, writes Andrew Bolger. This gives the company a market valuation of Pounds 78m. A total of 24m ordinary shares, representing 40 per cent of the company, are being sold. Half will be firmly placed with institutions, and half offered to private investors. Last year a surge of investment in new platforms helped OGC to make pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.5m on sales of Pounds 226.6m. After the flotation, which is being sponsored by UBS, the UK company will receive payment of a Pounds 6m inter-company loan from Fairhaven, the parent, which will leave OGC with net cash in its balance sheet. The offer closes on May 19 and dealing is expected to begin on June 1. COMMENT This offer has been keenly priced, but that is partly an attempt to woo institutions, who do not like to buy into businesses controlled by other companies. OGC has a good track record and offers an unusual opportunity to invest directly in the North Sea, but the fact that it is controlled by Mr Fred Olsen's Bermuda-registered company will put some investors off. Fairhaven has promised not to sell any more shares for two years, but might be willing to see its stake diluted through paper issued for acquisitions. The scale and 'lumpiness' of North Sea work can make activity levels erratic, but the impressive management team claims never to have lost money on any contract. Removal of the Fairhaven factor could, in the longer term, lead to a significant uprating.</p>

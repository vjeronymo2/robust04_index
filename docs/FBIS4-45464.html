			<p>BFN     [Text] The Narcotics Control Board said today that it has  announced that the security agencies seized 1.739 million kg of  cocaine, heroin, and Indian hemp in 1993 and arrested 147 drug  peddlers during the period.    According to figures released by the board, the haul is an  increase on 1.471 million kg seized in 1992 during which 87  people were arrested. The board said, however, that in view of  inadequate facilities, the figures quoted fall below the actual  trend.    It said 71 Ghanaians were arrested outside the country,  mainly in the United States and Thailand.</p>

It studied the specific ways to solve these  problems and issued some preferential policies and measures.    These policies and measures include mainly the following:    1. Finance departments, banks, and the enterprises engaged  in  the processing of these materials will make concerted efforts to  arrange special funds to pay off the arrears owed peasants  during the purchases of beets, flax, and flue-cured tobacco  before the end of February. Efforts will be made to ensure that  no new IOU is issued during this year's purchases.    2. The purchasing prices of beets, flax, and flue-cured  tobacco will be adjusted. In this year's purchases of beets,  the county will be taken as the accounting unit. The purchasing  price of the beets whose sugar content is 16.5 percent or more  will be increased from 155 yuan per tonne to 180 yuan, the  purchasing price of the beets whose sugar content is lower than  16.5 percent will be increased from 140 yuan per tonne to 165  yuan, and 165 yuan per tonne will be the lowest protection price  for the purchases. The purchasing price of flax will be  increased by 20 to 40 percent from the current price. Regarding  the purchasing price of flue-cured tobacco, the state already  increased the overall price from 130 yuan per dan to 165 yuan  last August, and therefore the price will not be adjusted this  time.    3. Various preferential policies will be continued. In beet  production, seeds will be sold at half the price, mix pesticides  will be provided free of charge, and mileage subsidies will be  given for transportation. The subsidy for vertical cultivation  of seedlings will be increased from 36 yuan per mu to 54 yuan.  Regarding flue-cured tobacco production, the profits and taxes  will be shared 50 to 50 percent or 30 to 70 percent by the state  and counties, and the money will be used in subsidizing  peasants' production and supplies of materials.    4. Construction of sugar, flax, flue-cured tobacco  production  bases will be intensified, and integrated management of trade,  industry, and agriculture will be applied. Beginning this year,  experiment will be conducted in the construction of the base  areas. Every processing enterprises will select two to three  major beet, flax, and flue-cured tobacco producing townships as  the base areas. The focus is on the construction of the villages  that applies the vertical cultivation of beet seedlings to 1,000  mu each and the villages that produce high yields thanks to  comprehensive technology dissemination. These villages will be  supported with certain amount of investment, and the overall  coordinated service focusing on farm mechanization will be  enhanced.    To boost the enthusiasm of the governments at all levels,  the  provincial government decided that beginning this year, all  specialized corporations should conduct the experiment first in  two to three counties where conditions permit and define the  base production figures of these raw materials. The economic  benefits gained from the processing of the materials above the  base figures will be shared 30 to 70 percent or 40 to 60 percent  by the corporations and the counties so that the counties and  the people can gain more benefits.    The provincial government also urged the governments at all  levels to adopt measures to ensure implementation of this year's  beet, flax, and flue-cured tobacco production targets by all  parts concerned. Based on the guidance plan formulated by the  province, governments at all levels should continue to assign  plans to every level and, on the premise that peasants' opinions  are fully respected, to peasant households in the form of  economic contracts so that peasants will know their production  tasks one year ahead of time. Counties and townships should  send a number of full-time cadres to coordinate with beet and  flax mills to publicize the policies and provide service to  villages and households, to resolve their misgivings and  difficulties, and to organize well the signing of the contracts.  They should also write down the preferential policies provided  by higher levels in the contracts so that the responsibility of  all parts concerned will be clarified. To meet the needs of the  enterprises engaged in the processing of beets, flax, and  flue-cured tobacco, the provincial government decided that this  year, 6 million mu of beets will be planted, and the output will  be 6 million tonnes; and 1.1 million mu of flax will be planted,  and the output will be 180,000 tonnes. In flue-cured tobacco  production, due to the outstripping of production over marketing  in the country, the tobacco planting areas are arranged at  850,000 mu, and the output will be 85,000 tonnes.</p>

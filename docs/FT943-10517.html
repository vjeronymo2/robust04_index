			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Wyefield shows 28% advance to Pounds 131,000 Pre-tax profits at Wyefield Group, the home furnishings manufacturer, rose 28 per cent to Pounds 131,000 for the six months to end-June, despite a poor second quarter. Turnover at the USM-quoted company, which changed its name from Lincoln House after the Pounds 8.2m purchase earlier this month of Medallion Upholstery, rose 6 per cent to Pounds 4.42m. Mr David Harland, chairman, said the difficulties in the second quarter were largely due to moving the manufacturing base to a modern factory and installing computerised cost analysis systems. Operating profit was cut from Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 134,000. Earnings per share were 0.5p (0.6p).</p>

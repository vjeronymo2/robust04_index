After the agenda was agreed, they  discussed a number of organizational issues.    Following this, the chairman of the session, Senate Speaker  Oliviu Gherman presented a communique released by the Senate  Commission for Defense, Public Order, and National Security  referring to the accusations of [Greater Romania Party] Senator  Corneliu Vadim Tudor made during the plenary session of the  Senate and by means of the mass media against the minister of  national defense [Lieutenant General Nicolae Spiroiu] and other  top officials in that ministry. The communique states that,  quote, within the next two weeks the commission will examine the  documents and the assertions underlying those accusations, as  well as the extent to which the comply with reality. On the  basis of the conclusions that will be drawn from those  investigations the Commission for Defense, Public Order, and  National Security will make suggestions to the Senate with  respect to the way in which the case should be solved, unquote.    Our correspondent, Victor Spirache, reports that the session  then proceeded to hear a number of reports elaborated by the  mediation commissions [mediating between the Senate and the  Chamber of Deputies], after which the senators continued to  discuss the articles of the draft bill on labor protection.</p>

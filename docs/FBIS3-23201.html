The two were convicted of trying to hijack a plane from  China  Eastern Airlines. Chief criminal Zhang Daxing, a self-employed  businessman, was sentenced to life imprisonment with his  political rights deprived for life, and his accomplice Chen  Jiangfu, a self- employed tailor, was sentenced to ten years  behind bars with his political rights deprived for one year.    On January 28, 1994, Zhang Daxing, a native of Taicang  county  in Jiangsu Province, and Chen Jiangfu, a native of Wujin county  in Jiangsu, bought air tickets from Shanghai to Hangzhou for the  following day.    Zhang told Chen his intention and detailed plan to hijack  the  passenger plane to Taiwan and showed him a letter of blackmail  to be used in the move.    On January 29, the two men got on the airplane, flight 5513,  of China Eastern Airlines. Soon after the plane took off, Zhang  got up and declared with the letter that the plane was hijacked,  threatening to explode it if it refused to fly to Taiwan.    Meanwhile, Chen kept an eye on people on board, following  Zhang's orders.    The two hijackers were subdued and arrested after the  airplane landed at the airport in Hangzhou.    They were convicted by the Hangzhou Intermediate People's  Court in its first ruling according to law. They pleaded guilty  and did not appeal to the higher people's court.    A spokesman of the Supreme People's Court pointed out today  that hijacking civil airplanes is a grave crime as it endangers  the safety of passengers and their property, adding that  criminals should be sternly punished according to law.</p>

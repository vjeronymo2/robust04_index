			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Survey of Mexico (1): Zedillo faces formidable obstacles - An economist with limited political experience, Mr Ernesto Zedillo, Mexico's president-elect, will assume power next month amid a highly volatile economic and political climate Mr Ernesto Zedillo becomes president of Mexico on December 1 with a daunting task ahead of him. Before his six-year presidential term is up, he has promised to deliver strong, sustainable economic growth, provide a million jobs a year and reduce the country's sharp inequalities in income. On political issues, he has pledged to overhaul the judicial and legal system, and implement sweeping reforms to turn Mexico into a modern democratic state. In the best of times, such promises would be hard to keep. The proposed democratic and political changes would undo a political culture of quasi-authoritarian rule that is still the norm in much of the country, and has kept the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party - the PRI  - in power for 65 consecutive years. Even if Mr Zedillo is sincere in his call for democratic change, he is bound to meet resistance. In view of the still formidable obstacles to greater industrial competitiveness, the fulfilment of Mr Zedillo's stated economic goals is unlikely to be much easier. Mexico's poor educational system, inadequate infrastructure, lack of an entrepreneurial culture and low savings rate set it apart from many of the Asian tigers that have grown so rapidly over the past 20 years. To make matters tougher, Mr Zedillo assumes power in a highly volatile economic and political climate. The peasant rebellion in Chiapas over the New Year, the recent assassinations of leading political figures and the increasing assertiveness of drug cartels, have worried investors. Many wonder whether the old corporatist structure that kept Mexico stable for 65 years is breaking down. In recent months, the exchange rate has come under pressure, interest rates have been forced up to around 7 per cent in real terms, and many sectors of the economy have suffered from a credit crunch. Despite such worries, there are grounds for guarded optimism. Mr Zedillo's policy proposals appear to address the right issues. He and the Ivy-league trained technocrats that surround him seem convinced that the difficulties Mexico now faces are proof that economic and political reform of the past decade needs to be speeded up, not slowed down, and that the modernisation of the state must continue. For Mr Zedillo and his advisers such modernisation appears to mean reforming the country's political and social institutions, and strengthening the rule of the law. Whereas President Salinas used the PRI as a vehicle to exercise power, dismissed more than half the country's state governors, and delayed judicial reform until it was too late, Mr Zedillo has promised to make the PRI independent of the government, devolve federal powers to state authority, and give independence to the judiciary. By opening new channels for political participation, these reforms - if they are carried out - may in the long run contribute to the stability of the country. But they will also deprive the president and his allies in the ruling party of many of the traditional mechanisms of political control. They could provoke a power battle between different interests groups in the country, as they simultaneously resist and seek to take advantage of the changes under way. Mr Zedillo has already begun one aspect of the reform of the PRI, so far complying with his promise not to insist on picking the party's candidates for elective office and to promote a more democratic selection-process. Such a reform - if stuck to - may strengthen the PRI at a local level, and make government leaders more responsive to the party rank and file than in the past. Internal democracy is expected to curtail presidential power, however, and make party members less loyal to the sitting president and his policies than in the past. Once he assumes office, Mr Zedillo is likely to announce a series of far-reaching constitutional changes to reform the legal and judicial system. While the details are still under wraps, Mr Zedillo is expected to change the make-up of the Supreme Court and give it more independence; create a civil service for the judiciary to promote efficiency and integrity; and perhaps enable judicial decisions to apply to laws in general, rather than just to individual cases as is now the case. Again, presidential power would be reduced. The president-elect has further promised an accord with the opposition on political liberalisation. Given the PRI's convincing win in the August election, Mr Zedillo is expected to be willing to make the Federal Electoral Institute fully independent of the executive. But in view of the extravagance of Mr Zedillo's electoral campaign, there is much greater uncertainly whether he will push through laws that make competition between different political parties more fair, and ensure the media play a more balanced, objective role in the political system. The president's ability to marshal support for his reforms - and contain the political consequences - will depend in part on the performance of the economy. It is probably no accident that President Salinas's control of the political situation began to slip when the economy was facing its greatest difficulties: gross domestic product shrank in the final two quarters of last year, and expanded by a modest 0.5 per cent in the first quarter this year. Fortunately for Mr Zedillo, a strong economic recovery already appears under way, with growth in the second half of this year predicted at 4 per cent. At the same time, inflation is likely to fall below 6 per cent this year; the budget will probably be in balance; and net debt is a less than a quarter of GDP. More importantly, productivity has grown rapidly in recent years, as companies have restructured and invested heavily in new machinery. Nevertheless, the large current account deficit - expected to be about Dollars 28bn - makes continued economic recovery heavily dependent on capital inflows, which partly depends on the international context. Mr Zedillo will have to balance the demands of foreign investors for an austere budget and orthodox economic policy and pressures within Mexico to tackle mounting social problems and improve infrastructure through greater spending. If the political situation does not improve, he may have to choose between maintaining high real interest rates or adjusting exchange rate policy. With Mexican businesses expected to come under increasing competitive pressure as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr Zedillo will certainly have to speed up the pace of micro economic reform. Deregulation is likely to be intensified at the state level and sectors such as railways will be opened up to greater private investment. Mr Zedillo will increase spending on training and education and probably introduce some fiscal incentives to encourage savings. Such reforms will help boost productivity and competitiveness - and raise real wages. But they are unlikely to do much in the short term to help the plight of the 14m Mexicans under the official poverty line. Most of these live in the countryside, have little education, and will find it hard to integrate into the modern economy Mexico hopes to attain. If economic reform continues to accentuate regional and social income disparities - between 1989 and 1992 the share of income of the poorest 40 per cent of Mexicans fell from 12.9 per cent to 12.7 per cent, while the share of richest 30 per cent increased from 65 per cent to 65.6 per cent - political sustainability of the reform programme could be in doubt. Mr Zedillo is a professional economist with limited political experience. There are some questions whether he will be able to manage this complex economic and political environment. The success of his efforts will determine in large part whether Mexico can make the jump from the developing to developed world before the end of the decade.</p>

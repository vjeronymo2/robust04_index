			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: INCOMNET TO BUY BACK UP TO 500,000 SHARES OF STOCK  </P> <P> Incomnet, a Westlake Village operator of computer networks, said its directors  authorized the company's repurchase of up to 500,000 shares of Incomnet's  common stock.  </P> <P> The stock would be bought back in periodic purchases over the next 12 months.  The stock closed Monday at $1.03 a share in over-the-counter trading; at that  price, the buyback would be valued at $515,000.  </P> <P> The directors authorized the repurchase plan because they believe the stock is  "undervalued at the present time," said Incomnet, which has about 13 million  total shares outstanding.  </P></p>

TV'S COVERAGE OF CUP TAKES HIT INTO THE BOARDS  </P> <P> Wayne Gretzky has definitely had an impact on the city of Los Angeles, but I'm  afraid L.A. is still a far cry from what one would call a hockey town.  </P> <P> Case in point: Game 2 of the Stanley Cup finals was tape-delayed to air an  Angel baseball game.  </P> <P> I thank Rockey Flintermann of Z Channel for bringing me back to my senses. For  a while I thought hockey had emerged from the preempt syndrome.  </P> <P> RON MANN  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

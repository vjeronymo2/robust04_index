			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: HK seeks market in NYSE-listed Chinese stocks Securities regulatory authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing are seeking to facilitate simultaneous listings in the colony and New York. The decision comes less than a month after the flotation of Shandong Huaneng, the first company to acquire a primary listing in New York. A further four China companies from the 13-strong 1994 batch of Chinese overseas listings are slated for the US. Hong Kong regulators are eager to enhance the colony's international reputation and obtain the extra business generated by offering a secondary market in New York-listed China companies. Investment bankers and investors are also behind the move. Mr Andrew Liu, president and managing director at Morgan Stanley Asia, said: 'In the long run (dual listings) are clearly going to be the trend. There are just mechanical problems vis-a-vis facilitating such listings, for example because of the different subscription systems used (in the US and Hong Kong). 'But the stock exchange has indicated its willingness to us and other firms, and we are having discussions about the rule changes they might need to make.' Issues include who has jurisdiction in a simultaneous US-Hong Kong listing, prospectus differences and underwriters' role in price stabilisation following a new listing. Hong Kong regulators are still undecided on whether a New York-listed China company would have to build in additional shareholder rights and protections to bring them in line with H share listings. However, as the bulk of trading is expected to be concentrated in the colony, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is likely to insist on this. Another key area is pricing. The stock exchange is in the process of finalising its report on pricing mechanisms.</p>

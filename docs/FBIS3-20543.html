			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Cheng Boming (4453 0590 2494) and He Dexu (0149 </F> 1795 2485) of the Beijing Securities Registration Corporation  and the Finance and Trade Institute of the Chinese Academy of  Social Sciences: "Difficulties and Countermeasures in the New  Round of Financial Reform"]    [Text] Difficulties in the New Round of Financial  Reform    In China's reform of the financial system, 1993 was a year  of  strategic change in promoting reform and a year in which  theoretical innovation and planning and design were made for a  new round of overall reforms. But implementing the new round of  financial reforms was by no means easy, still less could it be  accomplished in one step. It could be said that after trying and  probing for fifteen years, China's financial system reform is  now entering a crucial period of storming the fort and meeting  strong resistance. All of the situations that reform is facing  are deep-rooted, broad-based, and very hard to manage. So, each  reform is a hard-fought battle and each step forward can  encounter new obstacles and new difficulties.    The first difficulty: It is difficult in one step to  accomplish central bank macroeconomic control mainly adopting  economic methods and establish an improved macroeconomic control  system with mainly indirect means. The reason is not only  that the constraints and affects of external conditions (such as  government interference, enterprise "resistance" [daobi 0227  6656], and defects in the investment system) cause the central  bank to make "ineffective adjustments" and be "powerless to  control," but also in the difficulty that the central bank has  in transforming its macroeconomic goals and means from the  control model under the planned economic system to true market  controls in one strike; and even less can the creation of market  conditions for implementing indirect controls be accomplished in  a day. What is especially worthy of note, is that the pursuit of  a sustained high rate of economic growth has a strong impact on  the central bank's first goal, "a stable currency."    The second difficulty: There are numerous difficulties  in establishing a policy bank. This is manifested in that:  1) It is hard to clearly distinguish policy work from business  work and we lack a unified standard to measure them. Moreover,  this type of standard often is constantly changing with changes  in the industrial structure and development of the national  economy. 2) It is difficult to appropriately decide on the  capital and the day-to-day operating funds needed to set up a  policy bank. In the operation it is extremely difficult to  accurately give expression to or maintain the specifics of a  policy bank. With the slightest inattention, it can be  transformed into a second financial or commercial bank. Despite  the fact that policy bank loans are clearly supportive in  nature, they also are different from financial allocations. They  are not free and one-time and they are paid in advance,  circulating, and repayable. Also to a certain extent they  stress results. As banks policy banks also are different from  commercial banks. Despite their emphasis on accounting, profits  are not their principal goal and they do not compete with  commercial financial organizations.    The third difficulty: In developing commercial banks,  the burden is heavy and the road is long. Converting  Chinese specialized banks to commercial banks is a very long  process. We cannot successfully commercialize them by simply  issuing a decree. The main reasons are: First, to convert  Chinese specialized banks to commercial banks, there must first  be clear-cut property rights relations, that is implementation  of a stock system. But the restructuring of specialized banks  to implement a stock system would be far more complicated and  more difficult than the current stock system restructuring of  state enterprises. Second, the ratio of bad accounts, messy  accounts, serious credit asset losses, and bad assets much  higher than international banking standards that Chinese  specialized banks have formed over a long period of time also  are a major obstacle to their conversion to commercial banks.  Third, whether future state commercial banks can thoroughly  divorce themselves from the interference of various factors in  credit issues and truly act as autonomous businesses still  awaits various common efforts. Fourth, what scale is considered  appropriate for a future commercial bank to maintain still  remains to be resolved. Large-scale commercial banks have  numerous network points, wide coverage, and results of scale.  But they also can easily become monopolies, stifle competition,  and obstruct improvement in financial services and quality, and  they cause commercial banks to lack force as tools of financial  innovation. But if commercial banks are too small and too  dispersed it also is not helpful to developing the finance  industry and playing a financial role.    The fourth difficulty: Standardization and  internationalization of the capital market still requires  time. Totally marketizing the issuance of bonds, perfecting  the grading system for bond-issuing organizations and bond  credit, the scale of stock-issuing markets, and a unified stock  exchange market (especially, resolving the distinction between  the legal person and the individual stock market, distinguishing  A-stock and B-stock markets, and the entrance of state stocks  into the market) all will require arduous efforts.    Countermeasures in the New Round of Financial Reform    Faced with numerous problems in the new round of financial  system reform, we should by no means do nothing, and we  certainly should not retreat from the difficulties, but we  should adopt effective countermeasures. Surmounting difficulties  and grasping opportunities will spur on deeper reform of the  financial system.    --We should be fully prepared ideologically for the  difficulties of the new round of financial system reform.    If financial system reform is to be completely intensified,  we must storm the fortifications and run up against tough  situations, we must reform and restructure what constitutes  support for the old system and what can become important  components for the new system, and beginning with deep-rooted  aspects and adjustment of authority and benefits, advance  overall and break through on key points.    --Clarify the extreme importance of the government in  reform of the financial system.    There are two levels of content to financial reform: The  first is administrative innovation, also known as government  directed financial reform. It is manifested in the government's  involvement in the circulation of funds and the implementation  of currency policy by clear changes in financial laws and  administrative regulations to attain administrative and control  goals. Reform of these legal and nonlegal activities launched by  governments and governmental organizations aimed at changing the  structure of the financial system and expanding currency  authority is administrative financial reform. The second is  market innovation, that is market-directed financial reform. It  is manifested in the emergence of new financial assets,  financial tools, and financial techniques on financial markets.  From the perspective of the history and the reality of China's  financial system reform, we can say with complete reason that  delays in financial reform are mainly from lack of financial  innovation on the part of government--administrators. So, it is  an urgent matter for the government to take the initiative in  participating in financial reform, actively promoting it and  energetically advancing it.    --Stress overall coordination in promoting financial  system reform. The affects of the new round of financial  system reform are wide-ranging and far-reaching. As far as the  financial system itself is concerned, reform could intensify the  competition of various types of financial organizations and  promote overall development of finances and improvement in the  level of business administration. At the same time, it will  increase the business risks for financial organizations.  Increased instability in the financial system makes the task of  macromanaging currency even more arduous and complex. As far as  external affects of reform of the financial system are  concerned, 1) Since the central bank has made currency stability  its primary goal and financial deficits can no longer be taken  as overdrafts on the central bank, times have not gone well for  the Ministry of Finance. If policy banks are established, it  will add greatly to the burdens of the Ministry of Finance. 2)  After specialized banks are commercialized, the days of  enterprises relying on eating from the bank's big pot will be  gone forever and losing (or potentially losing) enterprises will  have difficulty getting support funds from specialized banks.  From another perspective, the affects of financial system reform  on these sectors conversely are constraints of these sectors on  financial reform. If they are not handled well, they could  restrain financial system reform in different respects. So, we  should stress overall reforms related to financial system  reform. This consists of two aspects: One aspect is that reform  within the financial system should be linked up and coordinated.  The other aspect is that financial system reform should be  coordinated with reform of other aspects (government, planning,  finance, investment, enterprises, etc.). If we do not "act as  the occasion demands" in these aspects, it will be difficult or  even impossible for financial system reform to develop in depth.    --Guard against the financial system reform plan losing  its form, changing shape, or becoming distorted. In  fifteen years of financial reform, this type of phenomenon has  frequently occurred. What was originally a very good reform  measure or plan can ultimately lose shape and not attain the  mark in the implementation. Not only does it not give rise to  the proper effect, on the contrary, it greatly exhibits the  opposite effect. So, in the new round of financial system  reform, we must put forth an effort to avoid a recurrence of  this type of situation and from top to bottom we must heighten  our awareness of the implementation of reform measures to ensure  that reform plans are all implemented in accordance with  predetermined goals.    --Accelerate financial system reform. The  arrangement of the overall framework and year of financial  system reform has now been essentially clarified, but the  specific steps of implementation still are not clear. Various  sectors, especially numerous grass-roots units, are waiting to  see. Normal tasks already are affected. If it persists, not only  could it affect the development of the finance industry and the  national economy, but it also could trigger new contradictions  and problems. Moreover, the coexistence of dual systems leading  to friction, gaps, and vacuums has caused the cost of reform to  reach the limits of tolerance. Increased reform efforts and  acceleration of reform have become choices that cannot be  delayed in financial system reform.    --Increase understanding of financial system reform and  stress the dissemination of financial knowledge. The new  round of financial system reform is more than many people  (including some high-ranking leading cadres) can accept. For  example, people still are not knowledgeable, are not accustomed,  or cannot even accept such things as policy banks, commercial  banks, and open markets. If there is not widespread  understanding of these basic concepts, it would naturally be  rather difficult to think about promoting the design of a new  system that is based on these concepts. So, increased publicity  and dissemination of financial knowledge and increased  understanding of financial system reform has become an important  part of promoting the new round of financial system reform.    --Handle the relationship between reform and stability  carefully and create a relatively relaxed economic environment  for financial system reform. Only in this way can financial  system reform be conducted smoothly. If the relationship among  the various aspects of the economy are bound up very tightly or  if serious inflation even occurs, it would not help to promote  financial system reform and it could obstruct reform of the  overall economic system and development of the national economy.</p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Legal aid payout enrages Lords The government may change the legal aid rules following the revelation that a wealthy businessman has received more than Pounds 4m in legal aid to fight an embezzlement action brought by his former employers, the Arab Monetary Fund. Dr Jawd Hashim, 55, a former president of Middle East-based AMF, is being sued for Pounds 33m he allegedly siphoned off from the fund into private Swiss bank accounts. The disclosure in the Lords on Thursday by Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, the Lord Advocate, that Dr Hashim's long-running legal battles with the AMF had so far cost the British taxpayer Pounds 4.01m in legal aid, caused outrage among peers. They demanded to know how someone who owns six luxury homes around the world and who reputedly employs servants can be eligible for public funding to fight a civil court action. The Legal Aid Board, which administers legal aid for the government, said yesterday it could not talk about the specifics of Dr Hashim's case, but that it might recover some or all of the money if Dr Hashim won the action. In general, anyone is entitled to legal aid regardless of nationality if they are a party to proceedings in a British court, it said. To get legal aid, however, an applicant must be financially eligible and must satisfy the board that he or she has a reasonable legal case. Financial eligibility is determined by a branch of the Benefits Agency, based in Preston, Lancashire. The agency will investigate an applicant's means. Normally someone with Dr Hashim's assets would not qualify for aid. But the agency must disregard assets if they are being claimed by the other party in the proceedings. As the AMF is claiming Pounds 33m from Dr Hashim, the agency could disregard assets up to that amount in assessing his means. Also, if a person's assets have been frozen by a court the agency cannot take them into account. An injunction freezing the assets of Dr Hashim and his wife was granted to the AMF at the beginning of the case. The Lord Chancellor's Department said yesterday that the issue of whether people in Dr Hashim's position should be eligible for civil legal aid was already under review. A similar review following the legal aid granted to Mr Ernest Saunders for his defence in the 1989 Guinness trial led to a change in the rules for assessing an applicant's assets in criminal cases.</p>

The two companies announced today that they  will cooperate primarily in the purchase of natural gas from the  West and its transport across Germany to Hungary. It has also  been agreed that Ruhrgas will provide auxiliary supplies via a  planned pipeline from Austria to Hungary, thereby improving the  country's ability to ensure a constant and steady flow.    As part of the cooperation there are also plans to expand  the  infrastructure of the gas industry in Hungary and to introduce  energy saving and environmentally friendly technology, including  the installation of gasflow controlling and measuring equipment.

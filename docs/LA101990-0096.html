			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TAFT BEATS EL CAMINO REAL WITHOUT BREAKING RANKS;  </P> <P> CROSS-COUNTRY: TOREADORS SWEEP TOP FIVE PLACES IN PREPARATION FOR MT. SAC  INVITATIONAL.  </P> <P> The Taft High boys' cross-country team has learned to differentiate between  low-key running and high-intensity racing.  </P> <P> Take, for instance, the Toreadors' 15-44 dual-meet win over West Valley League  rival El Camino Real on Thursday. Brian Godsey, Mike Krentzin, Kipp Ortenburger  and Torino Carr ran in a tight pack at Pierce College, then fell into their  "honor system" at the finish.  </P> <P> The system, implemented by Coach Mel Hein, arranges the runners at the finish  line according to their rank on the team.  </P> <P> "The No. 3 and No. 4 runners are not going to jump ahead of Godsey just because  they tied," Hein said.  </P> <P> Godsey and Krentzin finished the three-mile race in 16 minutes 34 seconds and  Ortenburger and Carr were each credited with 16:35. Freshman Cesar Rodriguez  placed fifth in 16:45 to complete Taft's second consecutive 15-point league  win.  </P> <P> "That's all we wanted to do . . . nice and easy," Hein said of the win.  </P> <P> "We ran them just as a workout," Godsey said.  </P> <P> Danny Hurley finished sixth in 16:53 to lead El Camino Real (1-1 in league  meets).  </P> <P> The ease of the pace, though, came as a surprise to Krentzin, who has  apparently recovered fully from a fracture in his foot that caused the junior  to miss the state meet in 1989.  </P> <P> "I thought we were running 18 minutes," Krentzin said. "But that's what you got  to do or else you'll get mentally burned out."  </P> <P> However Taft (3-0 overall in dual meets, 2-0 in league competition), the  defending City Section champion, is not likely to finish in a tight group nor  maintain an easy pace Saturday when it toes the starting line with nine of  California's top 10 teams at the Mt. San Antonio College invitational in  Walnut.  </P> <P> City rival Belmont, which Taft regards as Public Enemy No. 1 after being  upstaged twice by the Sentinels in invitationals this season, will try for a  third win over its newest rival.  </P> <P> Belmont won seven consecutive City titles before losing to Taft last year.  Following Mt. SAC, Taft begins serious preparation for its title defense.  </P> <P> "Next week, after Mt. SAC, (training) is going to be tough," Krentzin said.  </P> <P> "Yep, 80-mile weeks," quipped Godsey.  </P> <P> In other City dual meets at Pierce:  </P> <P> San Fernando claimed its third North Valley League boys' title in a row with a  22-35 thrashing of Kennedy. Kennedy's Jon Cohen won in 16:55, but the Tigers  grabbed the next three places.  </P> <P> The Taft girls' team defeated El Camino Real, 26-35, even though the  Conquistadores took the first two places.  </P> <P> Samantha Reed won in 20:25 and teammate Gina Zeno timed 21:26 in second. But  Taft's superior depth prevailed as Estela Sanchez finished third (22:14) to  pace the Toreadors (3-0, 2-0).  </P> <P> The San Fernando girls stunned Kennedy, 25-30, to win their second consecutive  North Valley League title.  </P></p>

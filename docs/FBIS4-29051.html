			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  ended three days of working-level auto trade talks in Tokyo  Wednesday [15 June] apparently without reaching consensus on  setting "objective criteria" as an instrument to gauge openness  of Japan's auto market.    "Mutual understanding on differences has been deepened," an  official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  (MITI) told a press conference, adding the atmosphere at the  talks was "cordial."    The officials of the two countries met Monday and Tuesday  and  then extended their talks for a third day Wednesday, to discuss  measures to improve the U.S. access to the Japanese auto market  and criteria to evaluate implementation of the measures, the  MITI official said.    "The Japanese side fully understands the U.S. position,  including a proposal on the most critical issue," the official  said.    But the official declined to disclose further details of the  talks, saying both parties agreed to keep quiet.    He said issues that have yet to be settled during the latest  talks will be put on hold until the next round of working-level  talks, expected to be held in Washington in the second half of  next week.    The latest working-level gathering followed last week's  subcabinet-level meeting in Tokyo where both parties failed to  bridge difference over objective criteria, the thorniest issue  under the bilateral trade "Framework" talks.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Forced to swallow a slimming diet - The mixed fortunes of Wasserstein Perella THE SIGHT of bid specialists eking out a meagre diet of deals is commonplace these days. But few investment banking firms can have feasted so well and then fared so poorly as Wasserstein Perella. Three years ago, this was the epitome of Wall Street 'chutzpah'. The business was formed in 1988 by Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph Perella, a couple of investment banking 'stars', who walked out of First Boston and set up shop on their own. A team of fellow-defectors followed - more than 20 in all - and the fledgling company quickly added top-level talent from other Wall Street houses and law firms. Within months, 'Wasserella' seemed to have a role in most of the mega-deals of the late-80s. These included Time's Dollars 13.4bn bid for Warner Communications; Al Checchi's Dollars 3.6bn offer for Northwest Airlines; Philip Morris's Dollars 13bn acquisition of Kraft; and the Dollars 25bn bid by Kolhberg, Kravis Roberts for RJR Nabisco. On the cross-border front, the firm was used by the likes of Martin Sorrell at WPP in his pursuit of the US-based Ogilvy Group. Wasserella itself went overseas in the hotly-contested battle for control of Gateway in 1989. It stepped in, where KKR seemingly feared to tread, and subsequently invested a third of its Dollars 1.1bn buy-out fund in subscribing for a 40 per cent share of Isosceles' equity. In 1989, its first full year, Wasserella ranked third in the league table of bid advisers - outclassing Wall Street stalwarts such as Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers. Partners airily complained if journalists described the business as a 'boutique'. Today, the picture couldn't be more different. Wasserella's profile has dipped so low that computer searches show the firm featuring in only four big US newspaper headlines since the start of 1991. According to Securities Data, its ranking in the M&amp;A league tables slipped to eighth place in 1990, 12th place last year, and then 15th in the first quarter of 1992. In New York, the firm defends this drop in the rankings by saying that it is the contrast that looks so marked. 'We almost seem to have to apologise for having done three big deals in 1989,' says Mr Mike Biondi, a partner at WP. Moreover, with the US bid scene moribund, it is impossible to tell whether large clients such as Philip Morris would employ the firm in the future. What can be said with certainty is that some of Wasserella's least successful deals have attracted far more publicity than those which 'worked'. In the UK, the tribulations at WPP and Isosceles have easily overshadowed the SmithKline Beecham merger. In the US, Northwest and Time Warner get more attention than Philip Morris/Kraft. But the story doesn't quite end there. Even by the late-80s, the media was speculating that Wasserella's desire to earn success-related fees caused it to push deals too hard and overstep the 'best practice' mark. A severe admonishment was handed down by the Delaware Supreme Court, which accused Bruce Wasserstein of weighting the auction for Macmillan, which he was defending, in favour a KKR-led buy-out. Wasserstein's manipulation of journalists was then given some play in 'Barbarians at the Gate', the best-selling book about the RJR Nabisco takeover. And, in the course of the Gateway battle, Wasserella managed to breach UK bid ethics - giving the impression that it would not accept the rival Isosceles offer, before doing just that. It was legally defensible, but a tactless debut. Perhaps the worst embarrassment flowed at Interco, a St Louis-based company which had wanted to see off some hostile raiders in the late-80s. Wasserstein advised on a Dollars 2.8bn 'recapitalisation' plan. This involved Interco taking on large debts and paying out a special dividend. It later went into liquidation. Last year, an independent examiner determined that the 'recap' rendered Interco insolvent - in short, fraudulent conveyance. But she spread the blame widely, saying that WP provided services 'acceptable by investment banking industry standards', and was hampered by incomplete information from management. Last month, Wasserella finally put the affair behind it: noting the 'unpredictability of jury trials' and admitting no liability, it settled a secondary lawsuit related to the Interco affair for Dollars 18.25m (Pounds 10.3m). In fairness, if Wasserella was pushy for clients, it was equally ambitious on its own account. It set up branch offices in London, Frankfurt and Paris, and formed a partnership with Nomura, swapping 20 per cent of its equity for a Dollars 100m investment. Today, the value of this strategy is debatable. A glance at the recent list shows a high proportion of cross-border deals - 27 of the 39 WP transactions listed by Securities Data as completed in 1991 or 1992 had a cross-border element. The biggest US deal was an Dollars 805m merger between two California-based companies. Nevertheless, the international overheads have sometimes been quite high; in the UK, for example, Wasserella spent millions on a property in St James's just before the market slumped. (It did better on its New York offices, where the lease comes up for renewal next year). The timing of the Nomura deal was unfortunate, given subsequent Japanese retrenchment. And rival advisers might also quibble about WP's precise role in some of the deals listed. The Dollars 1.1bn Wasserstein buy-out fund, meanwhile, is heavily dependent on the Isosceles investment. In terms of funds invested, this accounts for about one third of the total monies raised. Another third is unspent, and the remaining holdings - which range from a stake in the Yardley-Lentheric toiletries business to Wickes - are a mixed bag. In fairness Wasserella has made efforts to diversify its core business, offsetting the slump in bid work. Total staffing is still put at some 120 professionals, but the number concentrating on mergers and acquisitions work has fallen from about 100 to more like 75. In compensation, trading and underwriting activities have been built up. Yesterday, the firm continued on this track, announcing the formation of a subsidiary which will advise on mortgage loans and mortgage securities. And, publicly at least, the firm remains confident that the bid business will offer rewards long-term. 'With all the consolidation going on, there's going to be a lot of M&amp;A work,' says Mr Biondi, a little defiantly. Who snares it, when it does return, remains the question.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Abdallah al-Asnaj, "foreign minister of the </F> Democratic Republic of Yemen," by unidentified correspondent in  Paris; date not given]    [Text] [AL-HAYAH] How would you assess the talks you held  in Cairo recently?    [Al-Asnaj] The meetings held in Cairo, especially those  concerning the mission of the UN secretary general's special  envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, were separate meetings with a southern  delegation that had powers to discuss details of the stages of  implementing Security Council Resolution 924, and a northern  delegation that did not have sufficient powers or no powers at  all. Because the delegation did not represent the authorities  or the state. It was a partisan delegation from the alliance of  the General People's Congress and the Reform Grouping.    We considered this an attempt by Sanaa to gain time by  extending Brahimi's mission in the region without achieving any  progress with regard to a halt to the ongoing war. We informed  Brahimi of our view and willingness to meet with him at the  United Nations if the northern side expresses similar  willingness to engage in serious commitments aimed primarily at  securing a cease-fire and hence searching for a suitable  mechanism to ascertain the warring parties' compliance with the  cease-fire arrangements.    We proposed a mechanism whereby a body would supervise the  cease-fire, in addition to an implementing body to operate on  the ground and include northern and southern elements together  with Omani and Jordanian representatives, that is after the  approval of the two countries' governments. And then work later  to broaden the scale of Arab participation and form two African  and Asian groups to work under UN auspices and the supervision  of its secretary general. I believe that from his visits to  Sanaa and al-Mukalla Brahimi gathered specific ideas and  sufficient information to include in the report he is going to  submit to the secretary general. We will read this report when  we go to the United Nations at the end of the week, where we  will meet with [Butrus-] Ghali.    [AL-HAYAH] Assuming that Brahimi's report points to Sanaa's  intransigence, what will the next possible step be?    [Al-Asnaj] The war issue in Yemen no longer concerns the  Yemenis alone. It is a disaster for the Yemenis first. We are  not a state, nor do we enjoy full rights at the United Nations.  But there are states concerned with what is happening in Yemen  and which could -- in the immediate term -- pose a threat to the  region's security and stability.    Ssnaa has on numerous occasions announced a date for a  cease-fire, but it failed to observe it. We had hoped that it  would prove its seriousness, specify what it wants, and present  its view of how the cease-fire can be consolidated to enable  Brahimi to compare and define common denominators. But Sanaa  has not specified what it wants or how it understands the  Security Council resolution. So it is now futile to continue a  dialogue of the deaf while the fighting continues to escalate,  especially in Aden, where missiles are being fired at civilian  targets and causing painful human losses.    [AL-HAYAH] What are your expectations as regards future  events in Yemen?    [Al-Asnaj] The northern war machine will reach the point of  exhaustion by attrition. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has deployed his  forces over a vast area of land. And most of these forces are  suffering a great deal, especially as they were stationed  originally on southern territory. The al-'Amaliqah brigade has  been in Abyan for four years and has made its arrangements for a  long stay and adopted the human shield method along Iraqi lines.  These forces are no longer in a comfortable situation, and I  believe that they will retreat when they realize that they are  exhausted -- which will open the door to new Arab and  international mediations and endeavors to reconcile the two  parts of Yemen. As for the unity issue, it is settled. We  cannot preserve unity on the basis of pools of blood and the  Yemeni people's skulls. A unity that began through dialogue and  amicably must end through dialogue and amicably, because Sanaa  is not far from Aden, and vice versa. The possibility of  establishing relations within another framework, as was the case  four years ago, can be considered.    The brothers in Syria agreed to separate from Iraq and later  agreed not to establish unity with Iraq for regional reasons, so  why insist on Yemeni unity? Arab unity has gone through  numerous experiences, and maybe there was negligence in how to  establish it, because it is more emotional than practical.    [AL-HAYAH] Do you not fear the country's fragmentation?    [Al-Asnaj] The war is consolidating the position of  resistance and steadfastness, and if there were any political  collapses inside the country, the situation would have been  different.</p>

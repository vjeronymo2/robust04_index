Gonzalez is currently the government secretary,    "This is an anonymous call, write this down quickly," a man  with a faltering voice said before reading the message.    Early this morning a car bomb exploded up in an underground  parking lot at the Plaza Universidad Shopping Center in southern  Mexico City. There was extensive damage to some 20 shops, but  no one was injured.    The man who phoned AFP gave no evidence that he was in fact  a  member of the EZLN.</p>

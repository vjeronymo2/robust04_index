			<p>BFN     [Text] The Serbian regime of Belgrade has concocted a  story that an Albanian soldier has murdered two Serbian soldiers  at a barracks in the town of Mladinovac. This time, too, the  Serbian mass media announced the news in the same way as several  years ago when the Serbian authorities in Belgrade concocted a  story about the murder of several soldiers at a barracks in  Paracin city in Serbia. Even at that time, the killer was an  Albanian, the late Aziz Kelmendi.    According to Serbian television in Belgrade and the report  by  the same television in Prishtina, the murder of Serbian soldiers  in Mladinovac was committed by a Shaban Bajrami from Medvegje, a  commune situated in eastern Kosova, which, together with the  communes of Presheve and Bujanovc, have declared political and  territorial autonomy with the possibility of uniting with the  republic of Kosova.    According to Serbian television, the murderer Shaban Bajrami  allegedly fired on Serbian soldiers with an automatic weapon and  is now in hiding.    It is known that young Albanians are refusing to serve in  the  army of the Serbian aggressor. Even those who are violently  pressganged into this army are not given any weapons or  ammunition; thus these fabrications of the alleged murder of  Serbian soldiers by an Albanian soldier are completely false.  Serbia needs such propaganda to hide the truth about the  murders of hundreds of Serbian youths in the war in Bosnia. The  majority of the Serbian youths are being secretly sent to this  front, without even their families being informed .</p>

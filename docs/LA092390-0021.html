			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMEN CONDUCTORS  </P> <P> Because the Chamber Orchestra of the South Bay has had a woman conductor,  Frances Steiner, as music director since 1974, we were particularly interested  in Greta Beigel's Sept. 9 article "Music, Maestra."  </P> <P> The award-winning, fully professional orchestra presents a five-concert  subscription series as a resident company at the Norris Theatre for the  Performing Arts in Palos Verdes.  </P> <P> Ms. Beigel should have included Frances Steiner's name among the several women  she listed as pioneers in this field. Dr. Steiner was, in fact, the first woman  to conduct a professional orchestra (the Glendale Symphony) at the Dorothy  Chandler Pavilion.  </P> <P> ROBERT W. MILLER  </P> <P> President, Chamber Orchestra of the South Bay  </P></p>

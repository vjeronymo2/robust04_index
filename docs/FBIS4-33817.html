			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 9 Jun (NA) -- President Carlos Menem  reported on 9 June about a campaign by U.S. "specialists" hired  from Argentina to "establish" among citizens the issue of an  alleged illness of the chief executive that would make the  fulfillment of his term of office difficult.    Menem announced: "They [not further specified] have hired  specialists in transforming lies into rumors and rumors into  accurate news." In this regard, Menem emphasized that an  agreement had been reached with "U.S. citizens to establish this  issue of the president's illness," even though he did not  disclose the names of the people responsible for this alleged  campaign.    Menem again charged "some media -- not all of them, but  some"  -- with allegedly conducting a campaign against him. He  described this campaign as "a maneuver by some criminals who  proliferate around there in some media."    The chief executive complained: "Now, how will I stay for  three days in the United States? Do you know what some people  say? That I will be admitted [to a hospital] in that country.  These people have no restraint."    Menem urged the people: "Listen to the radio, watch  television, read newspapers and magazines -- pay attention to  the serious, responsible, and credible media, not those that use  scandals to make a few more pesos. This is no good."    Nevertheless, the president emphasized that he would give  the  journalists "more freedom, if there is still anything left to  give them."    Menem said: "Let them go on saying things. It does not make  any sense because, as Peron used to say, reality is the only  truth and the reality, which you can see now for yourselves, is  that the president, this brother of yours, is healthy, strong,  and willing to continue working."    Menem made these remarks during a 9 June Justicialism  Meeting  of Mutual and Cooperative Organization Leaders at the Central  Market.    Addressing the issue of the economy, Menem criticized a  petition made by "many entrepreneurial sectors that want a peso  devaluation."    Menem stressed: "They are aware of the fact that, as a  result, they would export more. Nevertheless, what would happen  to the workers? This fraud will never happen again in  Argentina."    The president indicated that if our "friends, the  entrepreneurs, want to export, they have in their hands all the  means to do it; they simply have to transform the enterprises to  adjust them to current circumstances."</p>

Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias participated in the  meeting. He said that the efforts continue and added that he  will meet the U.S. President's envoy in Skopje Matthew Nimetz  and international mediator Cyrus Vance. He said: There are  coordinated efforts to resolve the issue of Skopje. I hope  there will be a significant outcome.    The EU commissioner said the EU is trying to find a formula  to prepare the two sides to move closer. He said the EU is in a  difficult position because of the Greek measures against Skopje,  adding that these measures are against international law. The  European Commission and the EU support Vance and Nimetz's  efforts and will try to find a solution. Van Den Broek said the  issue does not impact only Greece, but also peace and stability  in the greater Balkan region. The commissioner said he is in  contact with FYROM because Greece has some good ideas.    The European Commission will discuss Skopje after the Easter  of the Catholics, which will be celebrated next Sunday [3 April].</p>

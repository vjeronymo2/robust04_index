			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: UK and Japan lead global equities down The announcement of the general election in the UK, a further weakening in the Japanese market and a fall in Mexico helped to push the FT-Actuaries World Index down by almost 1.3 per cent on the week. The UK government's decision to call the election on April 9, a date correctly forecast by commentators, came the day after the annual Budget statement. The Budget proposals were greeted coolly by most analysts, who also took the view that the opportunity for an interest rate cut before the election had disappeared. On Wednesday the UK market registered its biggest one-day fall since the stock market crash of November 1987. The rest of Europe was moved more by local factors than the political turbulence in the UK. Switzerland, which ended in a more positive mood following a drop in interest rates, still showed a decline as equities were depressed by higher rates ruling earlier in the week. German stocks moved lower following depressing results from BASF and Hoechst, both of which announced dividend cuts. Only Finland managed to break the negative tone after signs that its parliament might vote to join the EC. The fall in Tokyo, which only delayed the drop below 20,000 on the Nikkei, was not mirrored on the Pacific Basin, with Hong Kong soaring to a record high after HSBC reported an 83 per cent increase in net profits on Wednesday and said that it would not be making a rights issue. This news gave a boost to the market after fears that leading companies might be announcing rights issues. A successful government land auction also helped sentiment. Mexico, which has been a strong performer so far this year, was hit by profit-taking and uncertainty over when the North American Free Trade Agreement would be concluded. Analysts said that they did not see the fall continuing in the long term: since the beginning of the year the market has shown a gain of some 19 per cent.</p>

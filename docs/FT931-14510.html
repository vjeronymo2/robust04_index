			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Potential buyer found for stake in Johnson Matthey CHARTER CONSOLIDATED, the industrial holding company in which Minorco, the investment vehicle of Anglo-American, holds 36 per cent, is in talks to sell its Pounds 364m stake in Johnson Matthey, the precious metals group. The 38.4 per cent stake is to be split, with one buyer acquiring just under 30 per cent of the share capital in order to avoid triggering a full bid for the company. Charter owns 70,923,400 ordinary shares, which closed at 513p on Friday. Charter has been seeking a buyer for the stake for at least two years. It is also in talks about disposing of the remaining stake of at least 8.5 per cent. The identity of the potential buyer of most of the shares has not been disclosed but is believed to be a company in the same industry. 'Johnson Matthey's key concern is that the purchaser bring something of commercial value to the company,' said an official at Baring Brothers, adviser to Johnson Matthey. 'It is most unlikely that the purchaser would be interested in making a full bid for Johnson Matthey.' Mr Jeffrey Herbert, Charter chief executive, noted that in spite of the size of the stake, Charter is unable to control Johnson Matthey directly. Industry analysts speculate that Charter will use proceeds from the sale of its Johnson Matthey stake to buy out Minorco's holding in itself. 'At present it is not possible to say whether or not the current negotiations will be successful,' Mr Herbert said. 'Nevertheless it is in the interests of both Charter and Johnson Matthey to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.' Mr Gordon Thorburn, Johnson Matthey executive director of administration, said the company had been kept fully informed of the plans, which would be 'very satisfactory' if the deal went through as discussed. One strong shareholder would be exchanged for another, he said. Johnson Matthey, which employs 6,000 people in 25 countries, is the world's leading producer of platinum-based car anti-pollution catalysts. Last month it announced a 3 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 33.2m and raised its interim dividend from 3p to 3.2p. It contributed Pounds 12.7m to Charter Consolidated's first-half profits, up from Pounds 12.5m.</p>

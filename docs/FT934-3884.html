			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Pollution insurance at risk over Lords ruling: Cover withdrawal may lay companies open to claims Insurers may withdraw all cover for pollution in commercial policies, leaving much of British industry unprotected against future clean-up costs. The decision, which could cost industry millions of pounds, could be hastened by a ruling in the House of Lords later this week in a landmark case involving the Eastern Counties Leather tannery, its insurers, and Cambridge Water. A ruling against Eastern Counties will increase legal uncertainty about liability for past clean-up costs, prompting insurers to move quickly to remove cover for future 'sudden and accidental' pollution - caused by spills of chemicals or the release of toxic fumes, for example. The Association of British Insurers introduced new wordings for public liability policies excluding coverage for 'gradual' pollution in 1991. 'We are looking to see whether any pollution cover can realistically be provided,' conceded Mr Tony Baker, the head of public affairs at the ABI. The Lords ruling, expected on Thursday, is viewed as particularly significant by insurers because a Court of Appeal verdict last year 'moved the goalposts' in environmental liability cases, according to Mr Paul Taylor of Berrymans, the solicitors representing ECL and its insurers, General Accident. Cambridge Water Company originally sued ECL after it was forced to abandon a borehole at Sawston, Cambridgeshire, following the discovery of concentrations in ground water of perchloroethene, a dry-cleaning fluid used by the tannery to degrease animal pelts. Awarding more than Pounds 1m in damages and costs to Cambridge Water, the appeal court judges found that ECL was not negligent, but liable in 'nuisance' - an older legal concept under which it is not necessary to prove any fault to show liability. 'What we have seen in the analysis of the case is that English common law has produced a very strange animal - retrospective strict liability,' commented Mr Taylor. Insurers fear that they could become liable to pay as much as Pounds 3bn of an estimated Pounds 30bn needed to clean up land already contaminated. The implications of the case are 'sufficiently worrying for insurers to make sure they don't get caught out in the future', explained Mr Baker. It was likely that 'sudden and accidental' pollution cover would be excluded from all public liability policies 'within three years regardless of what happens', but that a decision in favour of Cambridge Water would 'hasten' any developments.

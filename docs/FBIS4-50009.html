			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xu Yang: "Spokesman Denies Nuke Aid to DPRK"] </F>   [Text] A foreign Ministry spokesman yesterday refuted an  allegation by a US official that China has aided the nuclear  programme and ballistic missile development of the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).    Wu Jianmin of the ministry called the charges by US  Assistant  Secretary of State Winston Lord "groundless and irresponsible."    Lord made the statements before a US Senate Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee meeting on May 4.    He said China has assisted the DPRK in the development of  ballistic missiles and nuclear devices.    Wu said China hopes all parties involved in the nuclear  inspection crisis adopt constructive and positive attitudes to  reach an early settlement through dialogue.    He also said at the briefing that China has noticed genuine  concern in Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's statement that  Japan's past aggression and colonial rule inflicted unbearable  suffering on many people.    China appreciates his indications that history shall be  treated correctly and the younger generation shall learn a  correct historical view Wu said.    Wu also announced that Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Stepanovich Chernomyrdin will pay an official visit from May 26  to 29, the first time a Russian premier will come to China.    Since President Boris Yeltsin's visit in February 1992, Wu  said, Sino-Russian relations have undergone steady development  in all fields.    He said Chernomyrdin's trip will bring new energy to  existing  ties, particularly economic and trade relations.    He also announced President Pascal Lissouba of the Republic  of Congo will visit China from May 19 to 25 at the invitation of  President Jiang Zemin.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> VACATIONS TAKE A TOLL ON HOUSE PLANTS  </P> <P> House plants can sicken when their owners are away on vacation if some special  provisions aren't made for them.  </P> <P> Plants can suffer from just a few days of neglect and adverse indoor  conditions. Follow these simple prescriptions from Decorating magazine on how  to keep a green thumb when vacationing.  </P> <P>  -- If plant owners are leaving for only a weekend, they should water  everything thoroughly before they go, and let it drain. Standing water will  invite rot.  </P> <P>  -- To reduce water requirements, raise the humidity level around plants by  grouping them in shallow trays lined with an inch of pebbles and a half-inch of  water. Don't let the bottoms of the pots touch the water.  </P> <P>  -- People leaving for several days should gather plants in a bright place but  out of direct sunlight. Set up grow lights and, with an automatic timer, give  plants 14 hours of light each day. Setting the timer to turn lights on at night  will help the house look occupied.  </P> <P>  -- Avoid feeding plants before leaving home. Fertilizing stimulates growth and  requires high levels of plant energy.  </P> <P>  -- To minimize plant stress, remove any dead or dying foliage and flower buds,  as well as any buds that would open.  </P> <P>  -- In winter, set the thermostat no lower than 60 degrees to prevent freezing.  </P> <P>  -- In the summer, many tropical house plants will take care of themselves and  even benefit from being placed outdoors in a shady, protected spot.  </P> <P>  -- Indoor self-watering devices can be purchased in garden supply stores, or  automatic watering systems can be easily made. For best results, set a pail of  water in the center of a circle of pots. For each pot, cut a length of nylon  wicking or old nylon stockings; bury one end in the soil and extend the other  to the bottom of the pail of water. The nylon will act as a wick, slowly  transferring water from the pail to the pot.  </P> <P>  -- Plastic tents can drastically reduce the water needs of plants. Place  several small pots in a dry-cleaning bag, and hold the plastic away from plant  foliage with sticks or bent hangers. For a large plant, use a painter's plastic  drop cloth.  </P> <P> Secure the plastic around the top of the container with masking or  electrician's tape. Make a few slits for air circulation. Most plants can  survive in a tent for a few weeks without additional water.  </P></p>

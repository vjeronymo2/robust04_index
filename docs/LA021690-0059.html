			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ILLINOIS;  </P> <P> DALEY PROPOSES NEW AIRPORT FOR CHICAGO  </P> <P> Mayor Richard M. Daley proposed building a $4.9-billion, 9,400-acre airport in  the Lake Calumet area on Chicago's Southeast Side, to be operational by 2010.  The site includes hazardous waste areas and about 5,500 residences. Rep. Henry  J. Hyde (R-Ill.), who prefers to expand O'Hare International Airport,  criticized Daley's cost figures as too low. State and federal officials and  residents of the area around O'Hare have been promoting the idea of a new  Chicago airport to relieve congestion at O'Hare. U.S. Transportation Secretary  Samuel K. Skinner endorsed the Daley plan.  </P></p>

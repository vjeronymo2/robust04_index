			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Arts: Sing a tale of Europe BRUNO Schulz was a Polish artist and writer of short stories in the period between the two world wars. He was shot in the street on his way home from the bakery by a member of the Gestapo in 1942. He inhabited, and seldom left, a city called Drohobycz in what used to be called Galicia. There was at least one event which brought the place into the news: oil was discovered nearby and there was a kind of Klondike. The Street of Crocodiles, full of western commercialisation, grew up in the inner city as a result. If you knew all that before, forgive me. It was unknown to me until I looked it up in the past day or so. Indeed the only reservation about the new production at the Cottesloe is that, without some of the background information, you may find it difficult to follow and possibly incomprehensible. The Street of Crocodiles is the title of one of Schulz's best-known stories. Here, however, it is used in very general terms. The play throws in lots of his tales, most memorably one called August, and is presented partly as a biography of Schulz. As in real life, he is shot at the end, though not as far as I could see by the Gestapo: the execution seems to come more from the stifling atmosphere in which he lives. Simon McBurney, the director, writes in a programme note that Schulz's writing 'provides no obvious key to dramatisation'. This production by Theatre de Complicite, of which McBurney is the founding head, comes up through the National Theatre Studio, where they experiment, question every word and generally make it up as they go along. It is the same process that recently produced a magnificent Uncle Vanya. Crocodiles in its way is magnificent, too. There is a wonderfully sustained musical accompaniment, composed and adapted by Gerard McBurney (brother of Simon) which certainly reminds us in what part of Europe we are. There is some remarkable staging. At the start, one character walks down a vertical wall, pausing only to put on his hat. Another emerges from a dustbin that looks far too small to have concealed him. The technique is that about every 10 minutes everyone goes into a frenzy. There is almost as much physical movement and dance as dialogue. Yet this is not inappropriate to the world Schulz describes in his stories. Here is a family subject to internal and external strains. Joseph, the son and plainly Schulz himself, is a quiet intellectual, still impressed by his father, once a dry goods merchant, now an amateur scientist fascinated by insects and eggs. Around them is a collection of women, hangers on and half-wits. It is also Poland in the 1930s. There is the recurrent sound of marching feet. So it is not surprising that they all go wild from time to time. It is less clear why the tone and the music should become increasingly religious, though apparently this was a turn taken by Schulz later on. There is no obvious gain in playing a lot of the lines in German and some in Spanish unless a) the dialogue does not mean too much or b) the Cottesloe audience is more multilingual than one imagines. For all the central European claims, Crocodiles struck me as rather Irish. This is an ensemble production, but it would be churlish not to mention Cesar Sarachu who captures the loneliness of Joseph. The other abiding memory is of the faces of the women: Annabel Arden as the mother, and Lilo Baur and Hayley Carmichael as the maids. Schulz has a line in the Crocodiles story about all the girls having a flaw in their beauty. All of these actresses demonstrate physical and facial acting to perfection: squints and all.</p>

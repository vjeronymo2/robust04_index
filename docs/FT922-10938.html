			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Punishing day for D-Mark GERMANY'S political and economic problems turned yesterday's foreign currency trading into a black day for the D-Mark, which lost out to nearly all the other major currencies. Its most punishing blows came in trading against sterling, the yen and the French franc as traders took a gloomy view of a wave of news coming out of Bonn, writes James Blitz. The widening strikes in the German public sector, two resignations from the Bonn cabinet and remarks from Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, all undermined the D-Mark yesterday. But traders also noted that sterling is continuing to make gains in its own right, propelled by confidence in Britain's government rather than mere disillusionment with the news from Bonn. The pound ended in London at DM2.9375, up 1 1/4 pfennigs from its previous close. In morning trading it narrowly failed to reach DM2.9400, peaking at DM2.9398. The D-Mark also suffered a sharp decline against the yen, finishing at Y80.5255. The German currency's only comfort was in trading against the dollar, where it ended at DM1.6510, only a touch weaker than its previous close of DM1.6505. Dealers said this was partly because the US currency had itself weakened so much against the yen yesterday. But big interest rate differentials between Germany and the US would have made it difficult in any case for the dollar to make much progress. The dollar finished in New York at DM1.6546. Sterling was the main winner in London trading, up on both the dollar and French franc. It finished in London at Dollars 1.7792, having opened at Dollars 1.7715, and ended at FFr9.9075, up from the previous close of FFr9.8825. The pound moved up to fourth from bottom in the ERM grid, overtaking the French franc once again. It ended in New York at Dollars 1.7765. Traders now feel that the next big barrier for sterling to cross is Dollars 1.78, its high in the immediate aftermath of the Conservatives' general election victory in April. If it reaches DM2.95 in the next few days, it will also cross its current central rate in the ERM, increasing speculation that Britain will put sterling in the narrow band of the ERM. The other big action yesterday came in yen trading, as the Japanese currency gained from comments made at the weekend's G7 meeting. The G7 communique said foreign exchange markets had been generally stable in recent months, but added that the decline of the yen was not contributing to the adjustment process. The yen rose against most currencies. It closed against the dollar at Y133.10 (after starting at Y134.55) and in New York ended at Y133.01. Against sterling, it finished in London at Y236.75, having closed previously at Y238.50.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "U.S. Lacks Understanding of Japan's </F> Economic Pump-Priming Package"]    [Text] It has been reported that U.S. President Bill  Clinton expressed dissatisfaction with Japan's economic stimulus  package at the Japanese-U.S. summit talks, which ended  unsuccessfully. In refuting this, the Ministry of Finance [MOF]  maintains, "It appears that the United States does not  understand the package well because of an inadequate analysis of  its details" (as stated by an International Finance Bureau  source).    The President expressed his dissatisfaction to Prime  Minister  Hosokawa at the summit talks, saying: "The package fails to  meet the accord reached at the framework talks held last July.  We agreed that the `trade deficit will be reduced to a very  remarkable extent.'" Touching on the income tax cut in  particular, which amounts to 6 trillion yen, President Clinton  pointed out, "I am concerned that people will put the money they  get from the tax cut into their savings accounts if the tax cut  plan is meant to continue for only one year."    Concerning the President's remarks, the MOF observes that  Clinton's dissatisfaction lies in the fact that in its  appearance, the total amount of the final income tax cut dropped  to "6 trillion yen for a one-year period" while Prime Minister  Hosokawa originally made a commitment of "18 trillion yen for a  three-year period" when he announced his concept on introducing  the national welfare tax.    The MOF maintains: "The concept concerning the national  welfare tax is based on a tax increase after three years.  However, the current tax cut is based on the issuing of  deficit-covering bonds only, and no decisions have been made on  future plans. In this connection, the current tax cut can be  said to be closer to the U.S. request for a tax cut by issuing  deficit-covering bonds." Thus, the MOF source explains that the  President's dissatisfaction has resulted from his insufficient  understanding of the details of the tax cut plan.</p>

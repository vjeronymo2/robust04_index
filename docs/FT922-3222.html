			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / International Company News: General Motors replaces top officers in finance arm GENERAL MOTORS yesterday carried out a shake-up of the management of its finance arm, including replacing the president and chief financial officer, over an alleged Dollars 400m loan fraud. The scandal centres on Mr John McNamara, a car dealer on Long Island, New York, who last week pleaded not guilty to racketeering and fraud charges involving the alleged diversion of more than Dollars 400m of loans from General Motors Acceptance Corporation, the group's finance subsidiary, to his personal investments. GM said yesterday an internal investigation had uncovered no criminal activity or self-dealing by any employee of GMAC, the group's largest profit centre, producing net income of Dollars 1.3bn last year. It announced a tightening of its credit procedures and management changes with early retirement and 'special assignments' or other new jobs for six senior GMAC officials. Mr William Lovejoy, GMAC's president and chief operating officer, who is replaced by Mr John Rines, 44, previously general manager of GM's service parts operation. Mr George Fenner, chief financial officer, is replaced by Mr John Finnegan, 43, previously a GM assistant treasurer. The company said 'appropriate' disciplinary action was being taken against other executive employees and staff at the GMAC branch office in New York which serviced Mr McNamara's account. Mr Robert O'Connell, the chairman of GMAC, has only been in his job since May 1, when his predecessor, Mr John Edman, retired. Mr O'Connell was ousted as chief financial officer to GM in a boardroom coup last April. GM said its inquiry had not revealed systemic problems with GMAC's operating and control procedures in its 'core business functions'. However, the subsidiary would be expanding these procedures, particularly those involving unusual financings and large credit exposures. The prosecution claimed that Mr McNamara, whose car dealing family had a 43-year relationship with GM, borrowed billions in short-term loans from GMAC between January 1985 and December 1991 to finance recreational vehicles exported to Cyprus. However, the vehicles did not exist and Mr McNamara allegedly repaid his old loans with ever-increasing new ones, while siphoning off money for his own use.</p>

			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Owners Abroad Companies normally put on their best face during a hostile bid. But it now appears Owners Abroad applied some thick make-up while fending off Airtours. During the bid, Owners did not issue a profits forecast but made much of its strong trading and the savings that would stem from its link-up with Thomas Cook. Just weeks later it has been steering profit expectations lower. Owners' shares have dropped 28 per cent since the bid failed. A period of underperformance is common for companies which have escaped takeover. Besides, tour operators' trading conditions are notoriously volatile. Nevertheless, it is surprising how quickly Owners has changed its tune. The costs of carrying extra aircraft through the winter are higher than the market assumed. The rationalisation costs accompanying the Thomas Cook alliance also appear unexpectedly large. That must grate with shareholders. Owners' management has a history of disappointment and there is now little prospect of a bidder salvaging the share price should the company falter. Following its tender offer, Thomas Cook accounts for 21 per cent of Owners' shares. That makes the company all but impregnable.</p>

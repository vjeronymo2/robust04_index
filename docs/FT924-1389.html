			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Managment: Flirting with danger at the office party - Jan Winster warns that employers may be legally liable if festive celebrations go too far The office Christmas party is the one time during the year when hierarchical barriers between company employees are traditionally lowered. Later, cases of innocent flirtation induced by too much alcohol and good cheer often assume legendary status in the unofficial annals of companies large and small. But there are cases where the recrimination can be based on more than embarrassment. Charges of sexual harassment can follow, and there are circumstances in which employers can be held liable. The Equal Opportunities Commission describes sexual harassment as 'unwanted verbal or physical behaviour which, on grounds of sex, adversely affects the victim or threatens the victim's privacy, dignity or self-respect in the workplace'. Sexual harassment can include sexual advances or remarks, or threatening, patronising or humiliating behaviour which affects the victim's work performance or creates a stressful working environment. But the legal definition of the 'work environment' has been broadened. It is increasingly clear, for example, that employers can be brought into cases in which the alleged actions took place while employees were undertaking a broad range of expected duties. Normal duties such as training fall in the category. But so too do social events, including Christmas parties. The key is whether employees were expected to attend such functions. That can obviously be a grey legal area. But it may not require evidence of written or verbal orders to staff to attend such a function to show that employees were expected to participate in a particular activity. Employers are also liable for the actions of employees during the course of their employment, even if they are not aware of the behaviour of those employees. There is a prima facie responsibility against which the employer's only defence is that appropriate preventive action has been taken. It might not be only politically correct, but also cost effective, for companies to develop a sexual harassment policy. A clear written policy statement needs to be accompanied by appropriate procedures to make clear that all forms of harassment are unacceptable in the work place. Such policies need to specify that sexual harassment includes unwanted behaviour such as touching, offensive language, jokes and graffiti. Staff training to prevent sexual harassment and counselling for any victims will give a positive message to employees that the company intends to pursue an anti-discriminatory policy. Companies also need to devise measures to ensure that victimisation does not occur to anyone who reports such incidents. The Equal Opportunities Commission publishes a free Guide for Employers to the Sex Discrimination Acts of 1975 and 1986, which will fit neatly inside any company Christmas card. The measures it suggests might frustrate some proposed party games, but they might also protect employers from becoming the unwitting third party in a seamy court case.

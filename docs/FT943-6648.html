			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: How the other half pay UNITED STATES Students must meet tuition fees but can get grants and loans from various sources, writes John Authers. Parents can take out government loans and Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students (PLUS). Most loans are paid off within 10 years of graduation. One of the most popular is the Stafford loan, which is means-tested and has a zero interest rate while the student stays in education. The interest rate is 8 per cent for the first four years of repayment and 10 per cent thereafter. Commercial banks make the loans, but the government guarantees them a return of at least 3.25 per cent above the Treasury bill rate and also pays interest to the lender while the student is in education. The downside is that the cost of defaults is estimated at around Dollars 3bn a year. AUSTRALIA Australia's system is the one that many vice-chancellors and academics want the UK government to adopt. Under the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, every student takes out an automatic loan when enrolling to cover a portion of the course fees. For full-time students, this is about ADollars 2,328 (Pounds 1,100) a year. The loan is not repayable until students have graduated, and their income has exceeded a minimum threshold, now set at the Australian average wage. Repayments are made through the tax system - students' codes are altered when they start at university and they pay a progressive tax rate of 2, 3 or 4 per cent until the loan is repaid in full. There is a 25 per cent discount for those who repay their entire loan in one lump sum. GERMANY Germany's loans-based system is much less sophisticated than Australia's. Loans are means-tested and the amount available falls quite quickly as parental income rises. The parental contribution is fixed and a legal requirement. Loans are repayable over 20 years with a minimum annual repayment, which can be deferred if graduates' income drops below a certain threshold. There is no interest rate - not even to keep up with inflation. And if students are in the top 30 per cent of their year academically, a quarter of the loan's value is written off.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 12 (CTK) -- President Vaclav Havel  met a delegation from the North Atlantic Assembly (NAA) and  discussed Czech integration in West European structures,  presidential spokesman Ladislav Spacek told reporters today.    Havel explained to them that the post-communist countries of  Europe were rather "impatient" to be admitted because in view of  recent historical experience they currently felt "in the air"  politically, economically and in issues of security. They "have  a different perception", Spacek said.    The delegation also met representatives of the Czech  parliamentary foreign committee and discussed the transformation  process underway in the Czech Republic as well as the creation  of a Europe-wide security system, committee chairman Jiri Payne  told journalists. Czech deputies acquainted NAA Chairman Loic  Bouvard with some "concepts of the future of European security",  Payne said.    Payne told CTK that remnants of the old bipolar logic had  still to be overcome. "The world isn't so straightforward and  black and white these days," he said. "There are also other  possibilities."    Bouvard and NAA Secretary-General Peter Corterier started a  three-day visit to the Czech Republic on Sunday. On Wednesday  they are due to fly on to Slovakia.    Bouvard also met parliamentary groups of political parties  today. Marek Benda, chairman of the Christian Democratic Party's  (KDS) deputies, said Bouvard and the deputies had agreed that  NATO was a "symbol of the protection of certain democratic and  other traditions of Europe". Deputies had also expressed the  wish that integration into Western structures should proceed  "much more quickly", he said.    The NAA strives to increase cooperation among the member  states of NATO. Founded in 1955, it meets twice a year in the  presence of NATO representatives.</p>

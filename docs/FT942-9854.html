			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Observer: Exposed The thundering herd at Merrill Lynch seems desperate to differentiate itself from the faceless workaholics at Goldman Sachs. Merrill has taken to illustrating its research work with specially commissioned cartoons of its star analysts. Merrill's latest European Equity Monitor has a fancy cartoon of Frenchman Edouard de Boisgelin, its foods analyst, in hunting fatigues and pith helmet, armed with an elephant gun. Merrill notes that 'pickings have been lean of late . . . but there will surely be a time when the food analysts return, guns blazing'. In the meantime, Merrill's clients will be comforted to learn that De Boisgelin 'takes regular weekend sojourns in the ancestral home in Normandy to tend the cellar with its ancient vats of Calvados.' And if you ever need a recommendation for a restaurant in Paris, 'Edouard is your man', says Merrill. Great, but what are his stock recommendations like?</p>

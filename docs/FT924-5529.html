			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Arts: A scandalous 'Lucia' at the Met - New York opera It is almost as if Pope Leo the Great had gone out with open arms to welcome the Huns into the city. James Levine, custodian of the Metropolitan Opera's comforting-splendiferous style of production, was apparently responsible for inviting a new staging of Donizetti's Walter Scott opera from (perhaps he had in mind current feminist critiques of the doomed nightingale heroines of 19th century lyric tragedy) Francesca Zambello. It was, in its way, an astute move. Ms Zambello is not easy to categorise as a stage artist: she can be curious and inventive; she can also lay on, as she demonstrated in the Earl's Court Tosca of last year, the grand show. This Lucia di Lammermoor is again a grand show, with its set (by John Conklin) of huge falling rectangles of gothic masonry and grey graves. But Ms Zambello must have realised she was there to create a scandal, and this is what she does - though it is a scandal that is forced and desultory, perhaps because of the pressure. It is a scandal that discloses itself only gradually. Apart from the ruined churchyard setting, and the fact that the chorus has been banished to the pit (where it remains throughout) while the huntsmen of Lammermoor are whiskery mutes forming geometrical patterns of grey plaid, the first act is pretty straightforward. Things start to get bizarre in the middle of the next act, when Arturo, the chosen bridegroom, arrives rising on a lift, vested in the puffed-up cream and gilt of the Ingres portrait of Napoleon in coronation robes. He is, Ms Zambello explains, 'the very emblem of the corrupting, wealthy lord', though the effect is rather to elicit sympathy for a creature so obviously being emblazoned with an image he cannot support. Then comes bathos. 'Where is Lucia?' he asks, and the titters from the audience provide the answer that she is lying on the ground ten yards from him, in a dress of sapphire strident against the general gloom. Ms Zambello's bold rethinking, let us say, of entrances and exits continues in the next act, where Lucia enters a deserted stage for her mad scene. There are no onlookers to be shocked, and thereby to shock the audience into a state of shock. Nor is there anything very shocking to be seen: no gore, just a lady in a white shift who looks angelical and expressively neutral. When she does eventually daub herself with a little crimson paint, from out of one of the tombs, one wonders why. This icy interpretation, if that is what it is, at least accords with June Anderson's vocal performance. She can cut any kind of figure above the stave with perfect accuracy; she can decorate, as she does in the first act, with exciting virtuosity; she can produce long single notes like diamonds; she can float at the top of the sextet with strainless grace. The absence of anything physiological in her singing is astonishing, and on those terms her performance is a triumph. Richard Leech as Edgardo is a different sort of character: ardent and engaging, maintaining a consistent strength of enthusiasm, and yet eager too for beauty of sound and line. Paul Groves provides a marvellously sophisticated and beautiful performance as Arturo, putting the production to shame for foisting such an absurd visual persona upon him. Juan Pons is gravely noble and musical as Enrico: there are no villains in this view. The orchestra takes every opportunity for breadth and richness of tone, with the horns and solo cello deserving as much credit as the harp of balladry and the will-o'-the-wisp flute of the mad scene, and yet Marcello Panni, the conductor, will keep urging them to thrust.</p>

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Arts: Lano and Woodley triumph - Perrier Award Worries that the Edinburgh Fringe was degenerating into little more than a comedy festival were relieved this year when a number of consciously humorous productions registering for the Fringe fell sharply. Even so the annual Perrier Award for the best comedy act on the Fringe always arouses interest and creates considerable ripples. The joy for the winner is not the money - Perrier gets away very lightly with just Pounds 3,000 and a few guaranteed bookings - but the certainty of a sharp rise in performance fees, and the near certainty of a television series. Led by Channel 4, the TV companies have been quick to see the new generation of comedians as cheap material which might just attract the elusive youth audience. Frank Skinner, Sean Hughes and Lee Evans are the most recent Perrier winners to feature prominently on the screens. On Saturday night, in the unlikely surroundings of the Waverley Shopping Centre, Lano and Woodley were named 1994 winners of the Perrier. It was something of a shock. Colin Lane and Frank Wood are Australians and unknown in the UK. Their victory is the kind of revelatory discovery which makes the Fringe worthwhile. Perhaps even more encouraging, they are not stand-ups - a form of egotistical paranoia with only incidental links to the comic - which thankfully seems to be in decline. Lano and Woodley are a double act, firmly in the tradition of other comic acts. Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello and Morecambe and Wise would instantly welcome them to the brotherhood. Lano is the good-looking one who (in his own mind at least) ruts all night. Woodley is the screwball, never able to get a date. They live together in comfortable bickering. The act is as wholesome and light-hearted as you could wish. It pleases many and offends none and would comfortably transfer to TV. Lane and Wood are actors and are able to improvise around the routines. There is audience participation as Woodley tries to prove that he can persuade a girl in the audience to kiss him. After the years of political correctness; full frontal bawdy; and surreal exhibitionism, the Fringe has finally come up with winners in the musical hall tradition. Lano and Woodley can be seen at the Lyric Shaftesbury Avenue in October in a festival of the Perrier short list. Other contestants of the prize, all stand-up comedians, were Alan Davies, Harry Hill, Jeff Green, Owen O'Neill and the American Robert Schimmel.</p>

			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HOSTAGE DAUGHTER'S HOPES RISE IN THOUSAND OAKS FOR ALANN STEEN'S RELEASE  </P> <P> Somewhere in the Middle East today, American hostage Alann Steen turns 51.  </P> <P> His daughter has tried to learn not to hope for too much in the 39 months since  he was abducted by Islamic extremists, not to hope that they really will  release him this time.  </P> <P> "Every time something comes up, I just get my hopes up," said Jackie Steen  Scardino, 29, of Thousand Oaks. "I just get really, really high on hope that  something will come of it and then it just comes crashing down."  </P> <P> Steen's captors have made promises before, only to follow with silence.  </P> <P> This time, despite herself, Jackie Scardino felt the hope rise again.  </P> <P> The Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine announced Wednesday that one  of three hostages, including Steen, would be released within 48 hours. The  faction also demanded that Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly go to  Damascus to discuss details.  </P> <P> But the United States refused to send Kelly and the 48 hours elapsed. As the  weekend began, Steen's release remained a possibility. But Jackie Scardino said  she felt cheated and called the captors' request that Kelly travel to Damascus  harmless.  </P> <P> "I feel really frustrated with Bush. I don't think he's doing all he could be,"  she said. "Maybe you can imagine what it's like to be a captive for the first  week, but imagine what it's like for three years. That's the message we'd like  to send to President Bush, is to imagine what it's like."  </P> <P> Of the government's refusal to negotiate with terrorists, Scardino's husband,  Chris Scardino, said cynically, "We never sell arms to them, either." Sending  Kelly wouldn't be "giving into a demand, when so much was at stake," he said.  </P> <P> Steen's family has heard reports that he has been kept in a small room with  three other hostages, with "no books and nothing to do mentally. I suppose he'd  be going stir-crazy," Jackie Scardino said.  </P> <P> She remembers the day her father was reported kidnaped: "I was very optimistic  he'd be in there for a couple weeks and that our government would get him out  because he was an American. And they haven't done anything," she said.  </P> <P> "People should think about it every day, and not just when we get news from the  Middle East," Chris Scardino said. "People should be more aware of it."  </P> <P> As negotiations over Steen's release stalled Friday, Jackie Scardino watched  her 14-month-old son scamper after a fuzzy orange ball in Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> Jordan Alann Scardino bears the name of the grandfather he has never met.  </P> <P> Jackie Scardino last saw her father's face in a grainy video released by his  captors two years ago. On Friday, she leafed through a book of snapshots with  some friends.  </P> <P> "He doesn't know I'm married, he doesn't know my sister's married, he doesn't  know he has a grandson," Jackie Scardino said. "It's very hard. I think about  him every day, but I can't let it get to me. There are times when it does. It's  just a feeling of helplessness."  </P></p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (14): South Asia's continued revels fail to awaken Tokyo CHEAP ASIAN stocks became a rare commodity during the third quarter, as most stock markets on the Pacific rim surged on rapid economic growth and low interest rates, writes Emiko Terazono, in Tokyo. However, while markets in southern Asia saw record levels, with Jakarta and Manila rising around 60 per cent and Singapore and Kuala Lumpur also soaring, the enthusiasm failed to spread to northern Asian markets, where Tokyo posted a marginal rise over the quarter on the prolonged economic slump, and Seoul lost ground on tightening of trading rules. The Tokyo stock market's Nikkei index, which rose a mere 2.6 per cent over the quarter to 20,105.71, despite a discount rate cut and a government fiscal package, was plagued by weak economic figures, the high yen, and a spate of corporate downward earnings revisions. Share prices withstood the political turmoil and the end of the 38-year rule by the Liberal Democratic party. However, investors were increasingly depressed by a 0.5 per cent fall in real GNP growth during the quarter, and leading blue-chips, such as Nippon Steel, revising downward earnings for the current business year. The new government's fiscal package, announced in September, mainly consisted of a list of deregulation measures, and failed to excite investors. And a 75 basis point cut in the official discount rate, to a record low 1.75 per cent, also failed to move funds into the stock market. Domestic support for shares has remained dull, and the quarter ended on a gloomy note, with jitters over a plunge in stock prices spreading among investors. Seoul's 1.5 per cent fall to 718.87 over the quarter was due to the government's anti-corruption campaign and the real-name system, implemented this month. Over 30 per cent of the country's money supply is seen to be supported by investments made in false names, to avoid taxes, and the government's determination to stamp this out has depressed investor sentiment. While the rise in the yen against the won will help Korean exports to Japan in the short term, uncertainty over the effects of the real-name system may dampen consumer spending and capital expenditure. The rest of the region saw increased buying by foreign investors, especially US funds, which were encouraged by the continued economic growth of the region. Singapore's Straits Times index rose 11.4 per cent over the quarter, amid the government's 'Invest Singapore' campaign, which aims to get more retail investors into the market. The government wants the country's high savings to be shifted into the stock market, ahead of the list of privatisations of state owned companies, including Singapore Telecom. Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, which rose 18.3 per cent, may weaken during the first quarter of next year, as the governments will be forced to tighten credit during the period. Nick Allan, managing director of Kleinwort Benson Securities in Hong Kong, sees both Bangkok, which rose 10.7 per cent, as still having further to go, as it has underperformed relative to other south-east Asian markets, and monetary tightening is not expected to be implemented till the second or third quarter of next year. Jakarta, which gained 16.8 per cent, is also expected to be supported by lower interest rates, after two years of tight monetary policy, and by strong corporate earnings. However, he advises investors to take profits on Hong Kong, which rose 8.1 per cent in the quarter. The market has underperformed, due to the slowdown in China and political concerns. A further increase in stock prices poses too much risk, says Mr Allan. Firm corporate earnings supported the Sydney market, which jumped 13 per cent over the quarter to 1,964.40. For the year ended last June, earnings per share at industrial companies rose 20 per cent, while resources-related companies saw an 8 per cent rise. While capital investment remains weak and unemployment high, at 11 per cent, widening profit margins due to restructuring efforts will support corporate earnings, says Mr Ian Wenham, at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Sydney. He expects the All-Ordinaries index to rise to 2,250 over the next year.</p>

			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHOCKLEY CAN'T DO EVERYTHING;  </P> <P> DESPITE HIS EFFORTS, PACIFICA LOSES, 12-7, TO HUNTINGTON BEACH  </P> <P> Chris Shockley was at quarterback. Chris Shockley played running back and Chris  Schockley punted for Pacifica.  </P> <P> If only the Mariners could have had Shockley at tailback and quarterback at the  same time Thursday. Then maybe he could have executed their option attack by  himself.  </P> <P> As it was, there just wasn't quite enough Shockley to go around. Though he  rushed for 152 yards, Pacifica lost to Huntington Beach, 12-7, in front of  1,000 at Bolsa Grande High School.  </P> <P> Pacifica was without starting quarterback Bobby Anderson, who was out with  muscle spasms in his back. Shockley, normally the tailback, had to play some at  quarterback because Anderson's backup, Chris Castellano, sprained his knee last  week and mostly was limited to passing situations Thursday.  </P> <P> "We wore him down," Huntington Beach Coach George Pascoe said. "Our defense  played very, very well for the second week in a row."  </P> <P> The offense was another story. Oiler quarterback Jeff Gibson's first pass was  picked off by Mike Christie. The Oilers had to punt on their next four  possessions and punter Matt Acocello had to chase one down that went over his  head.  </P> <P> Late in the second quarter, Huntington Beach took over on downs at its 47 after  Shockley failed while trying to run for a first down from punt formation.  </P> <P> Gibson completed a 20-yard pass to Doug Cunningham, a five-yarder to Jeff  Dunagan, then a 28-yard touchdown pass to Chad Taylor with about a minute to  play. The Oilers missed the conversion attempt.  </P> <P> Bret Clark fumbled the ensuing kickoff and the Oilers' David Roman recovered at  the Pacifica 24. Two passes by Gibson put Huntington Beach on the three but in  an attempt to stop the clock, Gibson was called for intentional grounding. With  a second left in the half, Gibson stumbled out of the pocket and found Don  Berger in the end zone for what proved to be the winning touchdown.  </P> <P> Gibson completed nine of 18 passes for two touchdowns, and 112 yards, 95 in the  first half. He was intercepted twice.  </P> <P> "(Our passing game) is going to be better," Pascoe said. "It's got to be  better. We had guys one or two steps all night, we just didn't get the ball to  them."  </P> <P> Pacifica came back with about four minutes remaining in the third quarter. In  only four plays, the Mariners moved from their 37 into the end zone. Shockley  ran for 33 of those yards in two carries and Castellano completed a 31-yard  pass to Raul Banuelos before Shockley scored on a two-yard run.  </P> <P> Castellano completed three of 15 passes for 76 yards and was intercepted twice.  </P></p>

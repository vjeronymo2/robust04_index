			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Owners focuses on Cook tie-up - Total dividend for 1993 expected to be raised by 43% to 5p OWNERS ABROAD yesterday increased its estimate of benefits that should arise from its proposed tie-up with Thomas Cook, the travel and financial services group and said it expected to recommend a 5p total dividend for the year to October 1993, a 43 per cent increase over last year. In the last defence document in which it can introduce new financial information, Owners Abroad said the revised figures further demonstrated that the Pounds 225m bid from rival holiday group, Airtours, understated its value and potential. The company said the benefits of the tie-up with Thomas Cook, which is controlled by Westdeutsche Landesbank, the German state bank, had risen from its original estimate of at least Pounds 7m to at least Pounds 9m for 1993-94. Estimates for the following year had been raised from Pounds 8m to Pounds 11m. Mr Howard Klein, Owners' chairman, said that if the Airtours bid succeeded, an enlarged group would have to make savings of Pounds 22.3m in the first full year after acquisition and Pounds 27.3m in the following year if Owners shareholders were to enjoy equivalent benefits to those that would flow from the Thomas Cook tie-up. This was based on the fact that Owners shareholders would end up with only 40 per cent of the enlarged group if they accepted the Airtours share offers. City observers said that by turning the focus of debate to the future and what Owners shareholders could expect from Thomas Cook, Owners Abroad had produced its most robust argument yet. Mr David Crossland, Airtours' chairman, said Owners had been selective with its figures when the facts showed that the rate of Owners Abroad's improvement in trading over the past year was actually slowing down. Owners Abroad's revised estimates of benefits have been verified by its auditors, BDO Binder Hamlyn, and advisers, Samuel Montagu. The increased estimates followed 'a better understanding of the retail arrangement (with Thomas Cook),' said Mr Geoffrey Stone, finance director. Mr Klein said these arrangements would benefit Owners at no extra cost. Thomas Cook would be marketing Owners Abroad's Enterprise brand standard family summer holidays in a brochure that carried the Thomas Cook name. Thomas Cook had a similar one year deal with Sun World, and estimated from that experience that it could deliver Owners Abroad with 80,000 additional passengers on this product in the first year. There was already a similar marketing of Owners' up-market Sovereign brochure and its flight-only Falcon brochure, which was being wrapped with the Thomas Cook name; and Owners would also market Thomas Cook's high cost, high margin, Faraway Collection holidays with a Sovereign wrap. Mr Klein said the increased estimates for the benefits of the tie-up were based on the assumption that 40 per cent of the passengers promised by Thomas Cook would have switched from Owners' holidays and could not, therefore, be counted as new business. In the year to end-September 1993, Airtours will, however, have the help of acquisition accounting. Airtours could provide for the losses on Owners Abroad's winter operations, writing them off against the balance sheet, but could take all Owners Abroad's summer profits to the enlarged profit and loss account. This would dramatically enhance earnings per share because of the highly seasonal nature of profits in the holiday business; Owners Abroad made a Pounds 26m loss in its 1991-92 winter, but profits of Pounds 56m in the second half. If the bid succeeded, Mr Klein said; 'this year could be a fantastic year (for Airtours) but watch out for next year' when the winter losses would depress 1994 profits. Mr Crossland said no shareholders would be looking at an enlarged group's eps this year. What mattered was the year ending September 1994, when Airtours would have chosen the brochures and decided the pricing and would have had a full year with Owners Abroad. See Lex</p>

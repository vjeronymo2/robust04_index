			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: Higher log prices boost profits at Carter Holt CARTER Holt Harvey, the New Zealand forestry group, has lifted net profits by 25.7 per cent, to NZDollars 243.5m (USDollars 132.3m), for the year to the end of March. The group attributed the improvement to higher log prices and strengthening economic activity in New Zealand. However, it said pulp and paper prices remained weak. The company, controlled by a joint venture between International Paper of New York and Brierley Investments, said the year had been good, although earnings had been affected by a protracted strike in October. Sales were unchanged at about NZDollars 2.46bn. The company reported an abnormal gain of NZDollars 7.5m from the sale of fishing group, Sealord, to a consortium of Brierley Investments and Maori tribal interests, and the sale of a 10 per cent interest in the Pan Pac pulp mill to a Japanese concern. These gains were offset by writedowns relating to the company's Chilean fishing interests and restructuring costs.</p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Construction Contracts: Opencast coal mining scheme Taylor Woodrow's materials handling specialist, BIRTLEY ENGINEERING, is to set up two modular coal preparation systems for a new open-cast mining operation at the former Nadins colliery at Cadley Hill, near Burton-on-Trent. The work is part of a Pounds 35m contract awarded to Taylor Woodrow by British Coal Opencast, covering extensive mining, civil engineering and restoration work at Nadins and at neighbouring High Cross, Derbyshire. Taylor Woodrow Civil Engineering is responsible for winning more than two million tonnes of coal by opencast methods at the two sites. At Nadins, Taylor Woodrow is undertaking a six-year programme to extract coal and prepare the 128-hectare site for industrial and leisure development. Birtley's contract is in two major parts. The first is the design, supply and installation of the washery, a twin plant system consisting of two Birtley Tornado dense-medium cyclone plants to process coal at 300tph. Worth Pounds 750,000, this part of the contract will be to reclaim coal-tip reserves. The second part, valued at Pounds 100,000, is a management contract for the plant peripherals, including the washery feed, handling of processed coal, fines and discard. A raw coal section allied to the open-cast mining will comprise reception area, crushing, screening and a stocking-out system utilising a Didcot tube. It is anticipated that the plant will be commissioned and in operation by mid-July.</p>

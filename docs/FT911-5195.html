			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Scots tests strongly opposed by parents and teachers IN SCOTLAND, well over half of all pupils do not take part in compulsory primary school testing as a result of opposition from parent and teachers alike, James Buxton writes. The Scottish Office is impotent to influence events. In Strathclyde Region, which accounts for nearly half the Scottish population, more than 65 per cent of parents have withdrawn their children from the tests, which are being applied to seven and 11-year-olds in English and mathematics. Similar withdrawal rates are reported from several other regions. Many teachers are refusing to administer the tests, raising the likelihood of disciplinary action by their employers, the regional councils. In what is becoming a political and educational disaster for the government, the Scottish Office has found it cannot oblige children to sit the tests. They are subject to different legislation from that in England. Parents and teachers object to the tests because they believe they threaten to dilute the universal comprehensive system in Scotland, leading to crude comparisons between schools and between pupils.</p>

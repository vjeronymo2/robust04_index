			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bullish views on Gas At least two of the market's leading broking houses, notably BZW and Lehman Bros were promoting British Gas shares yesterday, driving the stock price up 3 to 304p on relatively heavy turnover of 8.1m shares ahead of the strategy meeting scheduled for September 29. BZW, in a 50-page circular on the stock, described Gas as having the 'lowest political risk of all utilities'; that 'its current cost cutting plans and growing exploration and production profits will support five to seven per cent nominal dividend growth per annum'; that its extra cost cutting and cut-backs in capital expenditure; and that four of BZW's valuation methods suggest 10 per cent upside in the stock. Other energy specialists, however, said the shares had moved high enough in the short term. One said that the market had become fixated with dividend policy which may not be forthcoming in the September 29 meeting. 'If the market doesn't hear what it wants,to hear on September 29, the shares are heavily overbought,' he said.</p>

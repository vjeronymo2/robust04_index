			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Chen Dongfu (7115 2639 1133); Beijing </F> XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese at 1130 GMT on 12 May  transmits a service message canceling the following item]    [Text] Nanjing, 12 May (XINHUA) -- The Central Committee  of the Communist Youth League [CYL] recently held an on-the-spot  meeting on experimental "East-West labor service cooperation" in  Wujin County, Jiangsu Province. The meeting was held to  popularize across the country the successful experience of the  Wujin County CYL Committee in youth labor service cooperation.    As many enterprises in Wujin county were in need of  high-quality workers while a large number of migrant workers  from out of town could not find jobs and caused social problems,  the Wujin County CYL Committee actively introduced workers to  enterprises from as early as July 1992. Over the last two  years, the county CYL committee has introduced more than 3,000  qualified young people to some 200 enterprises in the county,  with the quality of new workers guaranteed by "four documents"  (CYL membership card, ID card, diploma, and proof of good  physical condition). The retention rate of the new work force  exceeds 90 percent, showing satisfaction among the enterprises,  young workers, and parents. The economy-related new undertaking  of the county CYL committee has been praised by the CYL Central  Committee as the "rainbow project."    Bayinqolu, secretary of the CYL Central Committee, said at  the on-the-spot meeting: The essence of the "rainbow project"  is to introduce labor service in an organized way and enable  developed regions to employ the surplus labor force of less  developed regions. During the process, we should strive to  achieve a virtuous circle of "young people seeking employment  outside their home towns, becoming specialized personnel,  returning home, and becoming successful entrepreneurs in their  home towns." The "rainbow project" is of great significance to  our country's economic development.    At the Wujin meeting, representatives of 50 county CYL  organizations in 19 provinces and municipalities conducted  negotiations on labor service cooperation. Wujin county alone  signed contracts with Sichuan, Jilin, Guizhou, and Henan  Provinces on hiring a total of more than 4,000 workers.</p>

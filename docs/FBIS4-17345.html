			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yevgeniy Yanayev report: "Russian Communist Party Holds </F> April Plenary Meeting. Zyuganovites Decide Whether They Should  Support the Bolsheviks or the Communists"]    [Text] Russian communists have launched a whole slew of  organizational measures that are primarily designed to resolve  whether supporters of this movement will adhere to democratic  rules or whether they will once again start agitation in the  parliament. Yesterday, a plenary meeting of Zyuganov's Communist  Party [CPRF] Central Committee opened in Zvenigorod. For a  leader with a penchant for parliamentarianism this will be a  test of strength on the eve of a party conference scheduled for  next weekend.    The plenary meeting will focus on the communists' theses for  a party program, which is to be approved by the All-Russia  conference. The program itself has been purged of the slightest  hints of Bolshevism. State-patriotic in tone, it recognizes the  need to continue reform -- of course, with a greater emphasis on  social aspects -- and tolerates the existence of private  property. Some CPRF "mid-level" chiefs, however, do not share  the state and social democratic views of their leaders.    Gennadiy Zyuganov's opponents are more attracted by the  stance of the Bolsheviks from the Union of Communist Parties --  the CPSU under Oleg Shenin, former Politburo member. The union  hews to unblemished principles, puts class struggle and  internationalism above anything else, and does not have a single  seat in the "bourgeois" parliament. Matters to be discussed by  the plenary meeting have taken on such an urgency in the party  that observers do not rule out the possibility of a split in its  ranks.    The agenda of the plenary meeting also includes the  consideration of an organizational matter. The meeting is set  to remove Ivan Rybkin from the Central Executive Committee under  the official pretext of his having too much work in parliament.  To all appearances, however, the actual reason is related to  his political platform, because many party members think that  the lower chamber speaker has embarked on the path of  opportunism. Too often have the views of Comrade Rybkin  coincided with those of the authorities, to which the CPRF is  still in opposition. KOMMERSANT-DAILY will report the results  of the plenary meeting and the party conference in its 26 April  issue.</p>

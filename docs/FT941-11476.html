			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Davy wins contract in Trinidad Davy Process Technology, a division of Trafalgar House, has won a Pounds 235m (Dollars 352m) contract to build a methanol plant in Trinidad and Tobago, just days after handing over a similar facility to the Caribbean Methanol Company. The decision to more than double the country's methanol capacity was taken because of the low cost of gas in Trinidad and its proximity and favoured access to the growing US market. The US economic recovery and the resulting rise in housebuilding has boosted demand for timber resins based on methanol.</p>

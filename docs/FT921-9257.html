			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Arts: Today's Television A good night for schadenfreude. Redundant on BBC2 (8.00) investigates the fortunes of two young City brokers who went from yuppiedom to redundancy. George exchanged his BMW for a bike and Guy discovered that he was no longer an eligible bachelor ..though the workhouse hardly looms since George had insured himself against redundancy and Guy had 'put something aside for a rainy day'. The third part of C4's series The Germans (9.00) considers the once unassailable Deutschmark and asks whether the economic miracle is over now that the Germans are struggling with the huge cost of assimilating the eastern half of the country with its antiquated factories, pollution and high unemployment. BBC2's profile of another European country, Fire In The Blood, in which Ian Gibson conducts us around Spain, is proving much the more impressive of these overlapping series. Today: the rapidly changing position of women. Those who have still never seen BBC Bristol's classic programme about the acrobatic antics of the grey squirrel (on which the lager ad is based) get another chance: Daylight Robbery (BBC2 8.30).</p>

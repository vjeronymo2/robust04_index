			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Travel Focus (France): Taking the waters in Aix-le-Bains THE PLAYER ran a few paces along the gravel and flicked his boule through the air in a fierce arc. The steel ball glinted in mid-flight before plummeting on to a nest of boules, one of which cannoned into the board at the edge of the playing area. The player smiled and applause broke out among the several thousand spectators. Under the floodlights, half a dozen matches were taking place. The competitors, many dressed in matching shell-suits, either catapulted their deliveries or knelt to roll the boule with a care bordering on tenderness. They seemed oblivious to the rain cascading into the marquee, or the gale buffeting the flaps. Taking refuge from the downpour, we had gate-crashed the national French four-a-side boules championships in Aix-les-Bains, taking place by the side of the beautiful Lac du Bourget. The surrounding village of tents, selling the local Savoy wines, food, or beer and pastis to quench the thirst of the fans, was a quagmire. Overnight, the temperature had dropped from 31``C to 13`C. The day before, we had taken a pleasure boat across Lac du Bourget - France's largest lake - to the Abbaye Royale at Hautecombe, which has a magnificent position on a small headland jutting into the water. The abbey, part of which dates from the 12th century, is the burial place of the counts of the duchy of Savoy. The duchy was part of the kingdom of Sardinia for a time but was incorporated into France in 1860. We sailed from the Grand Port at Aix-les-Bains, where an elegant arch of plane trees on the waterfront esplanade gave shelter from the sun. Swans, coots and mallards fought over the crusty pickings of baguettes thrown from the shore by picnickers. We disembarked by a stone boathouse, centuries old. Until recently, the abbey - restored in the 19th century - was run by the Benedictines; now, a Christian charismatic community has taken it over. In its cool and quiet, we were given hand-held radio sets which, like an unseen guide, directed us past murals and white statues. There is a cafe in the garden next to the abbey, overlooking the lake towards Aix-les-Bains. A woman from the community brought our drinks and stayed talking for a while. 'The climate is changing,' she told us. 'Certain kinds of flowers have stopped growing.' We were relieved to hear that she also was waiting for what she called the 'fraicheur' (coolness) to arrive. And, the following day, arrive it did. Deluges apart, Lac du Bourget and the surrounding flat-topped mountains have much to offer. There are plenty of water sports and rock-climbing: on a walk through the forest past the foot of the sheer cliffs we passed groups of climbers, including a family where the father was coaxing his young son up the rock face. And there is hang-gliding. We saw gliders almost motionless, thousands of feet up in the hot sky, buoyed by the lake thermals. Although there is little snow in winter - there is a micro-climate by the lake which makes bananas grow - resorts such as Grenoble and Albertville are not far. We found good walks, often with exhilarating views, around the lake although some required us to tramp along roads. The paths weaved through thick woods of pine, oak and beech, meadows, and villages with small-holdings growing grapes, pumpkins, corn, aubergines, walnuts and fruit. Not so exhilarating were the loud and unfriendly German Shepherds that guarded almost every house and farm. The dry grass of the meadows was dotted with delicate alpine flowers. It also seethed and rustled with cicadas, small lizards and much else besides, including a snake with bilious green spots. A swim in the lake was a good way to cool off at the end of a hot day's hiking. There is an entry fee for the beach in Aix-les-Bains, at the Petit Port. But at Chatillon, at the quiet northern end of the lake close to the picturesque Savieres canal that links up with the river Rhone, the beach was free and the water warm, if rather slimy underfoot. The chief claim to fame of Aix-les-Bains is its thermal baths, fed by hot springs. The earliest baths date from Roman times but the modern ones are situated at the top of the town in a vast building, drearily imposing and reminiscent of the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. In the footsteps of Bonaparte and Queen Victoria, not to mention Verlaine and the 50,000 French who take the waters annually on their national health service, I decided to try the thermal plunge. My wife abstained. The smell of sulphur grew stronger and stronger in the wide, marbled corridors and stairways where the curistes - the receptionist referred tartly to me, a once-off user, as a touriste - rested on sun-loungers. Afterwards, I felt both refreshed and enervated. The whiff of sulphur remained on my skin for the rest of the day. Before leaving, we heard that the Aix-les-Bains team had won the boules championship. Perhaps the water had something to do with it.</p>

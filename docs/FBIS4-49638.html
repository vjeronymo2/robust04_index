			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Chinese official in  charge of Hong Kong and Macao affairs Lu Ping said here today  that there is no atmosphere for him to meet Governor Chris  Patten at present.    Lu Ping said that a meeting between him and Mr. Patten  should  be intended to produce results instead of making show. He added  that a meeting without results would mean nothing but make  people in Hong Kong more disappointed.    Lu Ping was speaking at a discussion with PWC [preliminary  working committee] members, deputies to the Chinese National  People's Congress and members of the national committee of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference here today.    Lu said that he had come here in the capacity of the deputy  director and secretary-general of the PWC to attend meetings of  political and economic affairs panels of the PWC. So he had no  time to meet the governor because he had a full schedule here  and he had to return to Beijing ahead of schedule to take care  of business there.    "The British Hong Kong Government resists the PWC by not  allowing civil servants to contact the PWC, however, the  governor, as the top leader of the civil servants, asked to meet  me. Isn't he contradicting himself?" Lu asked.    Lu held that the PWC and the civil servants should contact  each other through different channels to lay down a foundation  and create a satisfactory atmosphere in which he could meet the  governor and the meeting could turn out results.    The British Hong Kong authorities expressed that they want  to  cooperate with the Chinese side in other fields, but people are  judged by their deeds, not just by their words as Chinese  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said.    He said that the report of the House of Commons of Britain  on  the Sino-British relations acknowledged Britain's policies  including those towards China had changed fundamentally from  cooperation to confrontation. "The British side has shown no  sign of sincerity to cooperate with China," he said.    "We want to cooperate with the British Hong Kong authorities  in other fields but we will not compromise on matters of  principle. The British Hong Kong authorities should show its  sincerity," he added.</p>

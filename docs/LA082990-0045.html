			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH AVOIDED GANGS, BUT CATCHES FATAL BULLET ANYWAY  </P> <P> Emiliano Landa's friends thought he was joking, popping firecrackers and acting  silly. They figured the 12-year-old was just feigning an injury when he ditched  his bike Monday evening and, clutching his chest, dashed to his house across  Hayford Street in Norwalk.  </P> <P> After Landa collapsed on his lawn, his friends said Tuesday, they knew it was  no prank.  </P> <P> Landa was dead on arrival at nearby Pioneer Hospital, the victim of a bullet  fired into his chest from a car cruising the 11900 block of Hayford Avenue. He  had been sitting on his bike, chatting with friends, said a spokesman for the  Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> "We had seen the car go by and we heard the noise," said Norwalk resident Lucy  Pinado, 14, who was standing near Landa when he was shot. "But we thought it  was just firecrackers. We didn't see no blood. We didn't know what was going  on. We just thought he was playing around."  </P> <P> Landa was the fourth Los Angeles County youth hit by gunfire Monday. Two  teen-age boys and a 12-year-old girl were wounded, the girl critically, in an  unrelated shooting Monday afternoon.  </P> <P> Although neighbors said that Landa had steered clear of the gang activity that  plagues the area, police said Tuesday that the gunman may have had gang ties.  Investigators said they have no suspects.  </P> <P> Residents of the neighborhood said gangs have been feuding in the area for  years.  </P> <P> "You see it going on all around," said Javier Chavez, a 17-year-old friend of  Landa's family. "But you never figure it would happen to somebody who has  nothing to do with gangs. He wasn't doing anything."  </P> <P> Landa's sister, Gloria, said her parents had enrolled the 12-year-old in a  nearby private school a few years ago to keep him far away from gang life.  </P> <P> At first, she said, he struggled at the new school.  </P> <P> "He was getting Cs and Ds at first," said Gloria, 17, talking between sobs as  she stood outside the family's well-kept corner home. "But then I talked to him  and told him, 'Nin -- we called him Nin -- you have to get good grades like me.  You can do it.' He started doing really good after that. He started bringing  home Bs and As. He really liked his reading classes."  </P> <P> When Landa was around the house, he would spend hours playing Nintendo video  games by himself and with friends.  </P> <P> For the most part, Landa's life was untouched by the gang violence around him  -- although rumbles and shootings were common in the neighborhood.  </P> <P> "He knew what was happening," said Gloria, "but he never wanted to get involved  in that type of thing. We would watch what was happening on the news, and he  knew he didn't want to be in a gang. He tried not to create problems for our  mom."  </P> <P> To avoid gangs, Landa hung out with other youths in the neighborhood who shared  his disdain for crime and gunplay. His friends said they had been eating near  the curb when the gunfire started Monday.  </P> <P> "We had just got back from a restaurant up the street," said Tim Huerta. "He  was sitting on his bike, and we were all talking. Not really talking about  anything, you know, just talking. That's when the car came by, and we heard the  popping sounds.  </P> <P> "At first, we didn't think it was about anything."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Vivian Louie contributed to this story.  </P></p>

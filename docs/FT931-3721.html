			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Volkswagen Tomorrow's meeting of Volkswagen's supervisory board will reveal how far the company is prepared to go to catch up speedier rivals. Although VW's consensual style enabled it to grow into the biggest European car manufacturer, it has lately stifled its response to the industry's rapidly-changing dynamics. VW's failure to change out-dated working practices has left it perilously exposed as Europe's car market lurches downwards. Its European sales could fall by 340,000 units this year. VW's new chief executive, Mr Ferdinand Piech, has signalled a fearsome intent to tackle VW's problems head-on. He has been assembling a strong management team, although the last minute failure to appoint Mr Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who was credited with turning round General Motors' European operations, is a big setback. There may be old-guard departures at senior level, but what matters most tomorrow is whether Mr Piech can at last produce a concrete plan for quickly cutting labour costs. Only that will show whether he has persuaded the trade union and regional government officials on VW's board of the need for drastic redundancies. The sense of crisis at VW may be his greatest ally. Unlike many of its rivals, VW's balance sheet is in reasonable shape. German car sales may fall 20 per cent this year, but they would still exceed those of 1990. Having already come to terms with the prospect of a dividend cut, the stock market may be right in anticipating better times ahead.</p>

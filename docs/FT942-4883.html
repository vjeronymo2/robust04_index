			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Europe looms small in UK voters' eyes To the extent one can gauge the prevailing mood of an electorate, British voters prefer the sceptical vision of Europe offered by Mr John Major's Conservative government. But they will vote overwhelmingly for the opposition Labour and Liberal Democrat parties. Perhaps more so than in any other European Union nation, the domestic record of the government, rather than the future shape of Europe, will decide the outcome in tomorrow's European elections. No-one in the British political establishment doubts that the governing Conservatives will suffer heavy losses. The question is whether it will be a defeat or a disaster. Opinion pollsters' best guess is that by the time the votes are counted on Sunday evening the party's representation in the Strasbourg assembly will be cut from the present 32 to anything between six and 20. Of the total 84 seats in mainland Britain, Labour can expect to win upwards of 50 and the Liberal Democrats anything from three to a dozen. The projections are precarious. The past few days have seen signs of a pick-up in support for the Conservatives. Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system ensures the winner invariably secures a disproportionate number of seats. But it also means that a small swing, as little or 2 or 3 per cent of the vote, will decide the outcome in many seats. Whatever the precise figures, Mr Major can credibly argue that the defeat will be despite, rather than because of, the essentially hostile approach to further European integration which has been the hallmark of the Conservative campaign. Britain has never been a nation of enthusiasts for Europe. But the legacy of a deep recession and the bitter arguments over the Maastricht treaty have reinforced instinctive hostility to the idea that the rest of Europe might know best. Mr Major's campaign has played to that mood. His emphasis on the preservation of the national veto in key areas of policy-making and on his government's opt-outs from the social chapter and monetary union have struck a chord with a large slice of the electorate. The idea of a multi-track, multi-speed Europe in which Britain can proceed at its chosen pace has allowed the Conservatives to paper over the worst splits in his own party. Eurosceptics have seized on it as evidence they are winning the argument - that Britain will opt out of further moves towards integration at the 1996 intergovernmental conference. The prime minister's rhetoric has provided further succour. The Tory party's enthusiasts (and there are still many) take comfort from the fact that Mr Major has given no binding commitments about Britain's stance at that conference. Mr Major's problem is that while the style of his campaign, with its exaggerated claims of a threat to British sovereignty, may solidify the core Conservative vote, most of the electorate will be more influenced by his dismal domestic record. A painfully slow economic recovery, the largest tax increases in recent memory, and a divided government unable to set a coherent policy agenda, do not provide the ingredients for electoral success. The voters are in the mood to punish Mr Major for his broken promises. Despite the disruption caused by the death last month of its leader, Mr John Smith, the Labour party has focused its campaigning effort almost entirely on this domestic agenda, branding the prime minister a weak leader at the head of a directionless government. On issues European Labour is now more 'positive' than the Conservatives  - committed to the social chapter and in favour of, if not enthusiastic about, a single currency. However, it has been careful not to shout that fact from the rooftops. The Liberal Democrats, long the most pro-European of Britain's mainstream parties, have adopted the same tack. Mr Paddy Ashdown, their leader, has toned down his commitment to a single currency and promised a referendum if the 1996 conference leads to a significant shift in sovereignty. Instead, the Liberal Democrats have concentrated their fire on domestic issues. Overall, the result has been a campaign that has denied the voters a rational debate on Britain's relations with its European partners. Whoever wins, Europe will be the loser.</p>

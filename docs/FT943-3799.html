			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of The Philippines (11): Foresters come under fire - Need progress damage the environment? The notices stencilled in green paint on the lamp-posts in one Manila suburb could belong to any western city. 'Keep Greenhills clean and green,' they read. The difference is that the adjacent road consists of eight lanes of cars, buses, jeepneys (elongated Jeeps converted into mini-buses) and juggernauts  -all caught in total gridlock and belching exhaust fumes into the sultry heat. Such situations are as much the norm as the exception in Manila, where it can take an hour to move between neighbouring suburbs. The sight of drivers and pedestrians wearing nose-and-mouth masks, or simply wrapping their faces with a scarf, is common. Air pollution, and associated respiratory problems, are just one of the country's intractable environmental problems. Like many developing countries, the Philippines is torn between the desire to push ahead industrial and commercial expansion, and the demands of its population for the most basic of acceptable living conditions. In the Philippines' case, these choices are made no easier by the history of public corruption; rapid population growth, which gets no discouragement from the dominant Catholic church; and past environmental neglect. The fragility of the Philippines' core infrastructure adds a further twist. Many Filipinos cheered when, on environmental and safety grounds, the previous Corazon Aquino regime decided to mothball a nearly-completed nuclear power station, built by Westinghouse Electric at a cost of over Dollars 2bn on the Bataan penisula. The decision, in 1986, was taken shortly after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, and partly justified in this context. 'What happened in the Ukraine certainly did not help the cause of those who wanted to operate (the plant). . . We want our own people to be spared this tragedy,' commented one presidential aide. Nevertheless, a few years later, this decision was being cited as one of the key reasons for the power crisis which suffused the country. Today, debate continues to rage over a number of proposed power-plant sites. On the urban front, Manila has some of the worst slums in Asia; and one environmental group has estimated that the sea-level in the city's bay area has risen by about a metre over the past 40 years, due to the dumping of garbage and the silting of the Pasig river. But the needs are no less acute in rural areas, where the incomes of about 70 per cent of families falls below the (low) poverty line. Much of the international spotlight has focused on mismanagement of the Philippines' forestry resource. This is a complex tale of excessive logging by both domestic and foreign interests, with efforts at curtailment undermined by political corruption. The loggers' practices, in turn, have led to river siltation and landslides, and thus compounded the impact of natural disasters. Indirectly, environmentalists claim, the mismanagement of the logging industry has contributed to thousands of human deaths. One activist puts the cost of siltation for over-logging at 4 per cent of gross domestic product, over a 20-year period. Efforts at long-term remedial action have had patchy results. But even the logging problem cannot really be isolated. Population pressure has been encouraging migration out of the lowlands and up the hills, especially in Mindanao. However, many of these migrants tend to pursue unsustainable cultivation techniques, with the result that their 'slash and burn' approach compounds the loggers' earlier damage. In this generally gloomy picture, there are some grounds for optimism. For a start, the Philippines does have a fairly active environmental movement, although many participants acknowledge that this is still splintered, and that ideological differences between the various non-governmental organisations (NGOs) tend to prevent cohesive action. Nevertheless, its voice is heard, and there is some pressure on government authorities to take note of its demands. The Philippines, for example, was a signatory to the Rio Declaration, which came out of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, promoting sustainable development. A Philippines Council for Sustainable Development was set up, its members a mixture of government agencies - including the Department of Environment and Natural Resoures - and representatives of the principal NGOs operating in the environmental field. 'The approach is not so confrontational now. . . It's better that we are talking to them,' comments Rene Encarnacion, at the Haribon Foundation for the conservation of natural resources. But no one pretends that this is more than a start. 'Frankly, everyone looks at the environment as an add-on job,' says Maxime Kalaw, president of the Philippines Green Forum. 'It's a question of re-addressing the issues of economic development - we need to look at a new economic order.' In the meantime, as if internal problems were not enough, it is debatable whether the west is helping. Greenpeace, the international environmental organisation, made its first foray into Filipino environmental politics earlier this year, when it alleged that hazardous waste was flowing from industrialised countries into the Asian nation - despite a law which bans waste imports. Computer waste from Australia and waste plastics, from the likes of Germany and the US, were among the breaches, it said. Another controversy has been triggered by the withdrawal of the US military from Subic Naval Base. Local environmentalists argue that toxic and hazardous waste was left behind, or inadequately stored. The US claims that standards were enforced, and that it is co-operating fully in the provision of information.</p>

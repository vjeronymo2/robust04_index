			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / US and France clash over exclusion zone in southern Iraq US and French officials clashed sharply yesterday over American proposals for establishing a military exclusion zone in southern Iraq. Ms Madeleine Albright, the US ambassador to the UN, called Mr Francois Leotard, the French defence minister, 'very ill-informed and counter productive' for saying the build-up of US troops in Kuwait to counter an apparent threat from Iraq was 'not unconnected to domestic politics'. Ms Albright said Mr Leotard's remarks 'give comfort to a brutal dictator who is a repeat offender,' and suggested that France's own position was motivated by its commercial links with Iraq. The row spoilt efforts by Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, to paper over differences among western allies on establishing an exclusion zone in southern Iraq. The US has stepped back from earlier suggestions for barring tanks and heavy military equipment from a vast demilitarised zone stretching up to the 32nd parallel - the boundary of the existing no-fly zone. Nevertheless, US officials insist some way must be found to avoid having to make a costly troop deployment any time Iraqi President Saddam Hussein wants to play mouse and cat games. 'For the future, obviously, we do not want to have to face Saddam Hussein's threats every few years in intimidating his neighbours and intimidating the UN, so we are in the process of trying to negotiate a resolution in the UN that would give us more permanent protection for the future,' Mr Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said yesterday. Mr William Perry, the US defence secretary, said the US troop build-up would reach only 30,000 and the troops could start returning home within weeks after Iraq withdraws forces from the Kuwait border. A more powerful force of US warplanes would remain for the foreseeable future to police Baghdad's actions and make sure Mr Saddam does not again threaten moderate Gulf states. The bulk of US combat troops will leave quickly when Iraqi forces complete their current retreat from southern Iraq, Mr Perry told reporters travelling with him from Washington to visit with American forces and hold talks with government leaders in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The peak of American troops expected to reach the Gulf would thus fall far short of the nearly 200,000 combat troops that Washington was prepared to send unless Iraq backed down. Mr Hurd, speaking at a press conference in Bahrain before flying to Saudi Arabia, said an exclusion zone was an option which comes under the category of 'some way' to be found to stop a recurrence of the Iraqi troops build-up. Another option, a pre-emptive airstrike, appears to have receded. One problem with a ground exclusion zone, which mirrors the air exclusion zone is that it could be seen as a step towards the dismemberment of Iraq. Although no western country wants Mr Saddam to remain in power, they remain committed to the territorial integrity of Iraq, if only as a buffer against Iran. The Gulf states generally, and Saudi Arabia in particular, are highly nervous about what officials call Iran's subversive inclinations. Saudi Arabia regards Iran as a threat because it encourages Islamic extremists within the kingdom in their anti-western stance. Officials say that if the imposition of an extensive ground exclusion zone now looks unlikely, more limited territorial restrictions could be imposed. There could be a military free-zone organised around Basra, a tank-free zone that would allow ground troops to remain in southern Iraq, or more intensive monitoring of Iraqi troop movements. Russia yesterday intensified its attempts to create a durable diplomatic resolution with the arrival in Baghdad of Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, on a shuttle that would also include several Gulf states. Diplomats in Baghdad said Mr Kozyrev is likely to seek a formula which might revive the prospect of giving Iraq a set of definitive criteria for an eventual lifting of sanctions, on condition that Iraq commits itself to the unequivocal recognition of its border with Kuwait. Moscow might also be eyeing an eventual revival of Iraq as a purchaser of conventional weaponry, which would be permitted once sanctions are lifted. Mr Hurd said sanctions against Iraq must remain. 'Iraq has not recognised Kuwait. I do not know of any country which favours lifting sanctions while this situation continues,' Mr Hurd said. US military officials say no limit has been set on how long US troops will stay in Kuwait, and this could depend on the success of US negotiations in the UN.</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> N.J. LAWMAKERS APPROVE NATION'S TOUGHEST BAN ON ASSAULT WEAPONS  </P> <P> The New Jersey Legislature approved the nation's toughest ban on assault  weapons Thursday night, including a provision that would require most people  who legally bought the weapons to give them up.  </P> <P> The measure, pushed hard by Democratic Gov. James J. Florio, cleared both  houses of the Democratic-controlled Legislature despite aggressive lobbying led  by the National Rifle Assn.  </P> <P> The new law would allow collectors to keep their weapons if they remove the  firing pins. It also would exempt target shooters who can prove they use the  guns in organized competitions.  </P> <P> The exemptions would cover about 20% of the 300,000 to 600,000 assault weapons  believed to be in the state, officials said.  </P> <P> Florio hailed the law's passage, saying: "These are weapons of war designed to  kill as many people as possible in the least amount of time. They have no place  on our streets, where too often our police find themselves outgunned."  </P> <P> But a leading opponent, Democratic state Sen. Raymond Zane, called the measure  "absolutely absurd," saying: "The bill is just directed at the wrong people.  These people are law-abiding citizens. Some of them are clergy, lawyers,  doctors, schoolteachers."  </P> <P> Under the new law, residents who own assault rifles and are not in an exempted  category would be given one year to sell them out of state. Manufacture, sale  or possession of the 38 kinds of assault weapons listed in the bill would be  punishable by three to five years in prison and fines of up to $7,500.  </P></p>

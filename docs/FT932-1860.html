			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Business and the Law: The gravy train bumps along - The row over big pay-offs for UK corporate directors is picking up steam The letter from Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, Postel's chief executive, informing the chairmen of FTSE-100 companies that in future he is 'minded' to vote against three-year rolling contracts for directors, has added a touch of spice to the row over big pay-offs for Britain's business leaders. As head of the country's largest pension fund, which owns 2 per cent of most UK-quoted companies, Mr Ross Goobey's thoughts carry some weight in British boardrooms. His concern is not that executives receive excessive rewards for doing a good job but that they receive huge pay-offs having failed to come up to scratch. These excessive payments are more often than not caused by three or five-year rolling service contracts, which are, at any time, assumed to have three or five years to run before expiry. Certainly there have been a number of well publicised pay-offs for senior executives in past 18 months. Lasmo, the oil services group, came under fire from shareholders earlier this year for a Pounds 2.2m pay-off to Mr Chris Greentree, its former chief executive. It was the result of three-year rolling contract. Glaxo is said to have paid about Pounds 3m to Mr Ernest Mario, its former chief executive and deputy chairman, after he resigned following a disagreement with Sir Paul Girolami, Glaxo's chairman. In March, BP revealed that it had paid Pounds 1.5m to Mr Bob Horton when he was ousted as chairman last year. These are just some of the bigger pay-offs in the past 18 months. But is it as worrisome a problem as Mr Ross Goobey suggests? According to Pension &amp; Investment Research Consultants, an organisation which advises shareholders on corporate governance issues, only 20 of the FTSE-100 companies have directors with rolling service contracts of three years or more. This may suggest long rolling contracts are less common than many believe. Mr Richard Weir, director-general of the Institutional Fund Managers Association, confirms that a number of institutions has been exerting quiet pressure on the issue for some time, and the trend is now towards one-year contracts. Nevertheless, his members remain very concerned that there is still a sizeable number of companies where three-year rolling contracts for senior executives are the norm. Not all fund managers and institutions, however, are in agreement that Mr Ross Goobey's solution - voting against the creation of three-year rolling contracts - is the best means for forcing the pace of change. Mr Weir says many of them feel it is inappropriate for institutional investors to interfere in what is essentially a management issue. This has prompted the suggestion in some quarters that the real reason the institutions are reluctant to do anything about it is because many of their executives are themselves on three-year rolling contracts. Mr Weir says this is unfair. Five of the 20 FTSE-100 companies identified by PIRC as having directors with three-year rolling contracts are themselves institutional investors: BAT Industries (owners of Eagle Star Insurance), National Westminster Bank, Prudential Corporation, Royal Insurance Holdings and Sun Alliance. But on the whole, he says, 'long-term contracts in the City are the exception rather than the rule.' Two of his larger members, M&amp;G and Mercury Asset Management, have switched to one-year contracts. But if most institutional investors are not going to follow Mr Ross Goobey's suggestion and vote against all new three-year contracts, how will the executive gravy train be stopped? Mr David Dalgarno, a company law partner with London solicitors Warner Cranston, believes large pay-offs are both legally unnecessary and arguably improper. They are legally unnecessary because there is a duty on the departing director to mitigate his financial loss after losing his job. It should be possible even in the current employment climate for most senior executives to find another job within a year to 18 months, he says. No company therefore should agree to pay out much more than one year of a three-year contract except in exceptional circumstances, he says. Large pay-offs are arguably improper because section 312 of the Companies Act 1985 makes it unlawful for a company to make any payment by way of compensation for loss of office without shareholder approval. In reality, however, section 312 only applies to payments to directors in connection with their office as directors. It does not apply to payments in respect of any post they may have had as employees of the company. More importantly, it does not apply to any payments which the company is contractually bound to make, nor to any bona fide payments by way of damages for breach of contract, or any pension payments in respect of past services. These exceptions are wide enough to ensure that the company's approval is rarely needed for golden handshakes. One solution might be to reduce by law the maximum length of service contracts which can be agreed by a company's remuneration committee without shareholder approval. At the moment shareholder approval is needed for service contracts exceeding five years. The Cadbury report on corporate governance recommended that, in future, service contracts should not exceed three years without shareholder approval. Even so, most companies believe that shareholder approval would still not be needed for three-year contracts. Mr Dalgarno believes that the solution lies in changing the corporate culture towards executives' contracts. Few disagree with that. Mr Weir, for one, says that legislation would be 'too inflexible and ways can always be found around it'. The only alternative, he believes, is a market solution. Shareholders and fund managers must persuade companies to restrict service contracts. The question is how to go about changing the culture. Mr Dalgarno says companies should be encouraged to move towards individual performance contracts which set out in detail what the director is expected to achieve. If those expectations are met then the rewards will be substantial. But there would be no pay-off for failure. Mr Edward Walker-Arnott, senior partner of City solicitors Herbert Smith, agrees that a change in the culture is needed. But he would not link performance bonuses to job security. Unless the non-executive directors are very vigilant most incentive packages are not very well-policed, he says. From the legal point of view the problem is caused by a combination of service contracts of more than a year and the refusal of the courts to make judgments in areas of incompetence. 'Courts hate areas of business judgment. They are not going to say that alleged incompetence by a chief executive amounts to a breach of an employee's legal obligations towards his employer,' Mr Walker-Arnott says. The solution, he argues, is to 'play it much tougher on contracts'. There should be a presumption against service contracts of more than a year. But companies are becoming increasingly aware of the adverse public impact of large pay-offs. Lawyers are just as likely these days to be asked about the perception of a severance deal as they are about the legal parameters of what is proposed, Mr Walker-Arnott says. Mr Ross Goobey's solution may not be to everyone's liking but by focusing on the issue he may yet prove to have provided the brake that finally brings the executive gravy train to a stop.</p>

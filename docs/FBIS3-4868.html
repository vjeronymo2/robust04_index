It is fresh in our minds that in  his autobiography entitled Suharto: Pikiran, Ucapan dan  Tindakan Saya (Suharto: My Thoughts, Sayings and Deeds),  published in 1988, the then 67-year-old President said that he  believed he was in his final term as President.    He said that by the time he accomplished his term in 1993 he  would be 72 and "more than old enough" for the job. He said  that his children shared the same opinion. In the same context,  Suharto was clearly free from any feelings of hurt or affront  when he said, "it is not exaggerating when one says that my  installation as president on March 11, 1988, was the last one  for me."    To many people here -- or perhaps abroad as well -- the  statement was more convincing than surprising. They became even  more convinced of the President's intentions when, three years  later, Suharto, who was then in his fifth term, said that he  would not try to persuade the People's Consultative Assembly  (MPR) to elect him for another term.    Speaking in a meeting with a delegation of the KNPI National  Youth Committee, the President then mirthfully introduced his  own acronym, in saying that "It is true I am becoming a `top'  man." But he said the meaning of `top' here was the Indonesian  acronym TOPP -- T for tua (old), O for ompong (toothless), P for  peot (hollow cheeked) and P for pikun (senile).    However, aside from those humble remarks, the President has  always also said that he would be ready to serve another term if  the people asked him to do so.    Then, for quite a long time we did not hear such remarks  from  the head of state, who is now serving his sixth five-year term.  But suddenly, last week, Suharto's American biographer, Donald  W. Wilson, quoted him as saying that he would step down in due  time. What made the statement different from the previous ones  was that this time he added that "I am not a president for life."    The statement is noteworthy because in so saying the  President seemed to have in mind President Sukarno's failure to  reject his nomination as "president for life" by the Provisional  MPR, whose members were handpicked by him. History has taught  us that in accepting the nomination, Sukarno led the nation  towards bankruptcy, both political and economic.    President Suharto's statement to Dr. Wilson could also mean  that some day he may feel the need to decline the people's  request for him to accept another term in office.    However, the question of when that time will come still  constitutes a national puzzle that the current ongoing public  debate prompted by the statement has failed to address  satisfactorily. This situation is quite understandable because  it concerns the right time for Suharto to decide to retire, so  that he will not enter history as the country's second president  for life.    Alamsyah Ratuperwiranegara, the former coordinating minister  of social welfare and a staunch Suharto supporter, said recently  that he took the President's statement, as quoted by the  biographer, as a strong indication that Suharto would not be  willing to be nominated for another term in office.    The view aired by Alamsyah, a shrewd politician who played  an  important role in the birth of the New Order government almost  three decades ago, is apparently based not only on the  conviction that the President was sincere in his remark, but  also that Suharto will be 77 years old when his current term  ends in 1998. Although Suharto's health has been better than  that of the average Indonesian during the last 30 years, at 77  he might well feel that he is too old for the job of leading a  nation of almost 200 million people.    A wise leader is one who knows when he has to step down. If  Suharto makes the right decision, he will no doubt be remembered  as a great leader who has always had at heart the interests of  all of his people, the poor included. In fact, nothing is  certain in politics but the good judgment of a wise leader.</p>

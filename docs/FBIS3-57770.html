			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by George Timmerman: "Belgian-Walloon Arms Exports: </F> `Business As Usual' -- Trade to Gulf States Continues"]    [Text] Brussels, 29 Dec -- In a few weeks Foreign Trade  Minister Robert Urbain [PS: French-speaking wing of the  Socialist Party] will have to present his report on the Belgian  arms trade to parliament for the first time. The publication of  such an annual report is required by the new and stricter Arms  Export Act of 5 August 1991, which only came into effect on 16  April 1993. The new law, which prohibits arms exports to  countries which do not respect human rights, was passed under  pressure from the SP [Dutch-speaking wing of the Socialist  Party] and the Volksunie [People's Union]. All signs seem to  indicate that despite the law, little has changed. The motto for  the Walloon-Belgian arms manufacturers remains: "Business as  usual."    The export of murderous weapons is traditionally viewed as a  very sensitive political issue. It is not just a moral  question. Since all the large producers of "classical" weapons  are on the other side of the language border [Wallonia], it is  also a loaded issue in community terms. Reasons enough to raise  as much fog and secrecy as possible around this aspect of our  export efforts.    On 17 May 1993 Volksunie Senator Nelly Maes asked Minister  Urbain which countries in North America and in the Near and  Middle East are supplied with arms by Belgium. The answer was:  "Since the publication of a list of countries which purchased  arms in Belgium is extremely delicate given relations with these  countries, the discussion of this report [on the application of  the new Arms Act] with the agreed confidential framework offers  the opportunity to further break down the information into  geographical areas."    In his answer, Urbain also revealed that since the new Arms  Act took effect, from 16 April to 15 May, licences were granted  for the definitive export of weapons, ammunition and materiel  for military usage, valuing 1,888 billion Belgian francs [BFr].  These products were overwhelmingly destined for NATO countries  (BFr1,542 billion) and countries placed on the same footing as  NATO countries (BFr135 million), he said. Other areas appeared  to be of secondary importance, according to Urbain's figures:  the Near East (BFr48 million), Asia (BFr114 million), Latin  America (BFr29 million), Africa (BFr2 million) and East Europe  (BFr15 million).  <H5>  Double? </H5>   However, reliable and fairly detailed information in the  possession of the editorial office, drawn up by the Customs and  Excise Administration of the Finance Ministry, point in another  direction. This information mainly covers the period just  before the new Arms Act took effect (January 1991 to July 1993).  Of course the large and apparently very urgent arms deliveries  to Turkey by plane from Zaventem fall under sales to NATO  partners. However, a civil war is clearly taking place in  Turkey, so that arms exports to it were prohibited under the old  law too. In addition, very large consignments of weapons were  transported by ship from Antwerp and Zeebrugge to Saudi Arabia  and other Gulf States, such as Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab  Emirates. Has this enormous trade to the Gulf States suddenly  dried up since the new Arms Act took effect? Since the middle  of April this year all licence applications have been examined  in the light of the provisions of the new Arms Export Act,  according to minister Urbain. All-in-all, in the first month  since the new law took effect, "one export application was  refused, because the destination was obviously violating human  rights." In any case the amount quoted by Urbain of BFr1.8  billion in one month seems strikingly large. By way of  comparison: Foreign Affairs Minister Willy Claes (SP), in  answer to a previous parliamentary question, said that Belgian  arms exports stood at BFr11.5 billion in 1991. If the period  under examination of mid-April to mid-May 1993 is representative  of the whole year, then in the course of this year arms exports  would have climbed to BFr21.6 billion. That is nearly double the  amount compaired to two years ago.  <H5>  Outdated </H5>   There was a time gap of no less that 18 months between the  passing of the Arms Export Act by parliament and the publication  of the implementation decrees in the Official Journal. During  all this time the new Arms Act was in a dead letterbox.  Insiders do not doubt that the postponement in the royal  decrees should be blamed above all on delaying maneuvers by the  PS.    This party, which is closely linked to the Walloon arms  lobby, had every interest in the longest possible maintenance of  the arms export licence system provided for under the outdated  1962 act. Only when a parliamentary committee of inquiry was set  up due to the efforts of Louis Vanvelthoven [Dutch-speaking wing  of Socialist Party], Nelly Maes [People's Union] and Johan Van  Hecke [Christian People's Party], could work be started on  changing the law. On 10 September the text was published in the  Official Journal. Scarcely two weeks later the "Martens eight"  government fell over different interpretations by the  communities of certain articles in the act. The French-speakers  wanted a large arms delivery to Saudi Arabia. And they had  their way, due to the lack of decrees on implementing decrees  for the new act. Subsequently a mediocre scheme applied of  "federalized" ministry arms export committees, each of which  decided on the allocation of arms export licences for its own  region. The task has been taken over by Ministers Claes and  Urbain since the present government took office.  <H5>  Political Support </H5>   Belgian arms exports mainly benefit two companies located in  Wallonia, namely Mecar and FNNH [New National Factory of  Herstal, formerly FN]. Mecar produces a product range  comparable to that of PRB, which in the meantime has been sold  to the British Astra company. Mecar is a subsidiary of Allied  Research Associates and most of its shareholders are U.S.  officers and Saudi Arabian sheiks. Virtually the whole of  Mecar's production is destined for countries like Kuwait, Saudi  Arabia and, until recently, Iraq. Specialists point to the  possibility that Mecar was specially set up in Belgium by the  United States to get maximum benefit from the flexible Belgian  legislation on arms exports. The Walloon-U.S. ammunition maker  can count on the virtually unconditional support of a number of  Walloon politicians.    The same applies to FNNH, at present owned by the French  Giat  [Association of Land-Based Weapons Industries] group. FN has  long been the country's most famous arms producer. The Walloon  regional investment company SRIW has not only provided repeated  financial support to Mecar and FNNH. To safeguard the export  licences of both companies, at the end of 1991 PS chairman Guy  Spitaels was even prepared to have a political and institutional  crisis, which led to the fall of the Martens cabinet.</p>

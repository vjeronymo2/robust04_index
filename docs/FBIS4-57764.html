			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Luiz Augusto Michelazzo] </F>   [Text] Sao Paulo -- Presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula  da Silva's program to fight unemployment is ready. It  contemplates creating 8 million new jobs in the next four years.  The Workers Party (PT) leadership is keeping this program  secret. It was prepared so as not to depend on legal or  constitutional changes and use resources that already exist,  although the PT leaders believe said resources have been badly  distributed. The program, which is entitled "Impact Plan Against  Unemployment," will cost nearly $25 billion. These funds will be  obtained from social and constitutional funds in addition to  budget allocations.    The plan is coordinated by Deputy Aloizio Mercadante and has  been drafted by five economists linked to the PT. It is divided  into three lines of action: the creation of jobs, assistance to  unemployed people, and active job policies. The program will  reassign funds from the Workers' Assistance Fund and the  Severance Payment Fund, among others, to investment in the  fields of civil construction, agriculture, agro-industry, and  tourism. The PT economists believe these fields to be the most  adequate ones for creating jobs.    One of the economists responsible for the program said: We  will be using the funds that have financed the sugar and alcohol  industry without ever benefiting those who work in the field  better. They continued to be temporary workers, itinerant rural  workers, and miserable.    According to him, the companies that evade taxes or do not  transfer Severance Payment Fund contributions to the government  will be left out of all benefits.    The idea is to create an data processing system that places  information at the disposal of the Ministries of Labor, Social  Security, and Health and makes it possible for these ministries  to exchange data, thus revealing discrepancies.    The agricultural cooperatives, the labor cooperatives, and  the micro enterprises, which are destined to absorb large  contingents of workers, will be favored when funds are  allocated. PT studies indicate that as a result of  ever-increasing production automation, industries such as  chemical laboratories and car-manufacturing companies no longer  create jobs in Brazil. In view of their economic importance,  however, these industries will not be abandoned.    The economist added: We believe there is a social emergency.  If nothing is done in this regard, there will be 14 million  unemployed people in the country in four years, and we will be  sitting on a powder keg. He believes low-quality jobs must be  created in massive numbers and at an speedy pace in order to  absorb unqualified labor.    In addition to financing machinery and equipment for  cooperatives, the program contemplates the establishment of  enterprise nurseries, which are common in Italy and Spain;  hangars equipped with infrastructure in which the  micro-entrepreneurs do not pay rent and contribute to the  government only by paying taxes on their activities.</p>

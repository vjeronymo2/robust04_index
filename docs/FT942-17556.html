			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / A prima donna's great performance: One of his fiercest critics called him 'the great seducer'. Now, a media tycoon with no previous political experience seems very likely to become Italy's next prime minister. Robert Graham explains how the image triumphed over reality For the nation that invented opera, the sudden emergence of Silvio Berlusconi as the star of Italian politics seems only natural. As in opera, the staging and music have been all important. The banality of a libretto is masked easily by the magic of a prima donna's great performance. So, in Berlusconi's spectacularly successful election campaign, form triumphed over content, the package over the person, and the image over reality. Italians like and admire the bella figura and do not always want to know how it is created. Berlusconi's was a superb performance. One in four of the Italian electorate voted for this self-made man whose media empire is the second largest in Europe. Now, he looks set to become Italy's next prime minister after less than three months in politics. Eugenio Scalfari, editor of La Repubblica newspaper and one of Berlusconi's most out-spoken critics, described him this week as 'the great seducer'. And, indeed, Berlusconi's performance on the political stage has been an extraordinary act of seduction, charming a sizeable segment of the Italian public into turning a blind eye to his political qualifications and the more questionable side of his past. Scalfari concluded that the main reason for Berlusconi's success was his ability to convey the impression of 'do-it-yourself politics' - that an individual can take on the system. No one could have imagined six months ago that Berlusconi, a non-politician, would probably be Italy's next leader at the head of a newly-formed political movement, Forza Italia. It was equally improbable to conceive the public embracing a movement with a name culled from a football slogan ('Come on, Italy]'). Berlusconi himself was at a crossroads in the middle of last year. His political friends were vanishing off the scene, discredited by the corruption scandals. His profitable near-monopoly over Italian commercial television looked increasingly vulnerable as politicians across the ideological divide sought to re-draw the map of public and private television ownership. Berlusconi's Fininvest empire itself was floundering under a burden of debt caused by over-ambitious purchases during the boom of the 1980s. When he formed Forza Italia last October, he seemed still to be playing the businessman, orchestrating a political challenge through existing politicians. Only at the end of January did he go public with his political ambitions. He declared: 'I am telling you that we can . . . that we must build together for us and our children a new Italian miracle.' Even then, too much seemed stacked against him. He talked of family values, passing over the fact that he had gone through a messy divorce before taking a second wife. He talked of his faith in catholic morality while his television stations pumped out cheap soap opera culture and a diet of big-bosomed titillation. He talked of free enterprise, ignoring the protected environment of much of Italian business from which he had benefited. He talked of reducing Italy's huge mountain of debt when his own companies, like the Italian economy, had grown on debt. Above all, he appeared to have the terminal disadvantage of being associated with the ancien regime - the clique of Christian Democrat and Socialist politicians who had presided over a politico-economic system that had become riddled with corruption. His Fininvest group grew on the back of political protection provided in Milan by the Socialist party and its leader, Bettino Craxi. He had also joined the P2 secret masonic lodge of Licio Gelli, who had been linked with many of the obscure episodes of the past - such as the collapse of the Banco Ambrosiano. Berlusconi enjoyed a very public friendship with Craxi; this helped in 1990 to seal the unusual structure of television ownership in Italy. He gained control over three channels, dominating commercial TV and providing access to 45 per cent of the national audience. Nowhere else in Europe is one group permitted such a near monopoly. Fininvest came under the scrutiny of investigating magistrates in Milan who questioned his close aides over how the television licences were carved up at the end of the 1980s. His younger brother, Paolo, was charged with corruption relating to a waste disposal contract. How, then, was Berlusconi able to present himself as both new and acceptable? For a start, he was a household name as 'Mr TV'. He was also responsible for one of the most easily identifiable success stories in Italy. In 1986, he bought the ailing AC Milan football club and, with a series of expensive player transfers, turned it into a cup-winning machine. 'If one looks back now, the building up of the Milan team, with its high-profile international sign-ons, was the beginning of the construction of Berlusconi's political ego,' says one of his former employees. He worked assiduously to create the image of Berlusconi the winner through Milan's relentless series of victories. He saw the Milan fans as his fans and played to them with his well-staged appearances: landing at the stadium in his helicopter and turning up, dressed immaculately, for training sessions. With hindsight, Berlusconi's critics overestimated the damage of being associated with his political godfathers and under-estimated his existing appeal among Italians, especially the young. During the 1980s, frequent polls among them showed Berlusconi was their favoured role model. Significantly, he picked up a high portion of the young vote in this week's general election. 'He is a household name - people identify with him easily,' said Roberto Lasanga, his election campaign manager when it began. 'He's new simply because he was not a politician and never pretended to be. He doesn't talk down to people like a politician. Instead, he takes people into his confidence: he talks as someone who wants to put things right by entering politics.' In other words, Berlusconi was not hurt by being seen as a traditional politician. On the contrary: in the one hostile television interview, he managed to make himself a victim in the eyes of his supporters. He claimed the interviewer had nothing on which to attack him except raising old chestnuts such as his friendship with Craxi. He and his advisers realised, correctly, that after two years' non-stop exposure of one corruption scandal after another, Italy had been given an overdose. Corruption had been replaced by concern over jobs and declining incomes as the people's main worry. Indeed, Berlusconi did not raise the corruption issue during the campaign. And there was no impact when his brother, Paolo, was arrested halfway through and admitted paying bribes for building contracts to develop a Milan suburb - even though Paolo was running the construction company created by Silvio and the bribes went back to the early 1980s when Silvio was very much in charge. Nothing rubbed off on the candidate. The same applied to well-publicised leaks that Marcello Dell'Utri, Berlusconi's long-standing Sicilian friend and the brains behind his political bid, was under investigation for links with the Mafia. Although the information came from a highly respected former magistrate and head of the parliamentary anti-Mafia commission, Berlusconi turned this to his advantage and claimed his enemies were using the state apparatus to run a vendetta against him. The campaign organisers also discovered that people paid little heed to political polemics on television except for those provided by a handful of chat show hosts. Only these - not the politicians - were seen to articulate the problems of ordinary Italians. In his television appearences or at public meetings, Berlusconi avoided speaking from a lectern and adopted the role of a chat show host, wandering across the stage with a microphone. More importantly, Berlusconi - who had once written a thesis on marketing, and made his fortune out of understanding the advertising market - realised the value of targeting his audience with the right message. His researchers discovered that ordinary people felt excluded by Italy's long-ruling political establishment. This led to the formation of Forza Italia clubs, allowing the public to take part in the political debate in the same way that a football fan can follow his team through a supporter's club. In less than four months, more than 13,000 clubs were formed nation-wide, organised through Fininvest. Here, the human and financial resources of Fininvest's advertising arm, Publitalia, and the empire's Standa stores chain were invaluable. The message and the manner in which it was put across by Berlusconi were researched and scripted carefully in a way that no previous Italian politician had bothered to do. Berlusconi, although 57 and balding, was made to look youthful. He went around with a permanent make-up artist and, where possible, sought to be filmed by his own in-house camera crew. His double-breasted suit, immaculately pressed shirt and neutral tie made him look successful without being too imposing - the kind of person every middle class mother would trust immediately when answering the door bell. As for the message, it bore a strong ideological tone of right-wing, free market ideas. He even tried to enlist the services of Lady Thatcher in his campaign although, unlike Britain's one-time Iron Lady, he conveyed his message in a non-confrontational way, keeping political jargon to a minimum. He spoke in disarmingly simple terms. 'This country has four million employers. Just imagine if every one of these were to create one new job. We can solve the problem of unemployment,' he told a television audience. While this appealing solution to Italy's most pressing problem did not impress the economists, it certainly had many Italians nodding in agreement. They want to believe he can create 1m jobs and lower taxes. All this helps to explain how Berlusconi got to where he is. It offers few guidelines on how he will fare as a politician. In his favour, he has enormous energy and determination and, according to his supporters, an excellent business brain. But this is not necessarily enough to create a good politician. He and Forza Italia would have faded into obscurity if he had fared badly. But, having come out on top, he now becomes vulnerable to the very things from which his campaign strategy protected him: a critical and fickle public audience; the magistrates investigating the practices of Fininvest and its alleged criminal links; and the conflict of interest between owning Fininvest and being a politician. His personality as a manager is ill-suited to dealing with a fractious political establishment, even if this establishment is being reconstructed. He is vain and wounded easily by insults. He is a poor public speaker once forced outside scripted remarks. In particular, he has made himself a hostage to campaign promises that cannot be fulfilled easily in the present climate without raising Italy's debt or the spectre of inflation. In short, he has studied carefully how to be a politician from the viewpoint of marketing a product - Silvio Berlusconi, the new face in Italian politics. But while elections may be about marketing, the broader art of politics in Italy is about survival in a jungle of intrigue. Let us not forget that Italy fathered Machiavelli. And if you listen to the stories behind the music and the prima donnas of Italian opera, you will find they are often of betrayal. As They Say in Europe, Page XVIII</p>

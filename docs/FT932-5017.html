			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Fat of the land NATURALLY I was called in to see Kenneth Clarke, Britain's new chancellor of the exchequer, this week, and a rich experience it proved. Also highly fattening and superbly entertaining, for the chancellor is a trencherman and a voluptuary, a man whose talk is spattered with bursts of florid poetry and football scores and tales from the music halls - a tribune of the people, if ever I met one. On one side of his desk stands an enormous walnut sideboard groaning with concoctions - mainly rustic ales and ciders from Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Warwickshire, Herefordshire, Yorkshire, Cornwall, the highlands and lowlands and off-lying isles. On the other side of his desk stands another enormous walnut sideboard bearing tureens of soup and a display of traditional foodstuffs - Glamorgan sausages, Bradenham ham, wyau Ynys Mon (Anglesey eggs), cucumber ragout, parsnip and shellfish salad, soft roe tart, jellied eel mousse with watercress sauce, Bakewell pudding, St Valentine's syllabub. Help yourself, old chap, said the people's tribune. So I filled my plate with food such as pudding of capon neck with giblet gravy, and crunched and munched heartily while the people's tribune vouchsafed to me his feelings and higher mental processes. I feigned surprise when the new chancellor declined to discuss what he calls the 'technicals' - inflation, GDP, sterling, prices, job losses and certain aspects of Kondratieff cycle theory that I thought might appeal to him - on the grounds that he has only just got his scuffed suede shoes under the desk at the Treasury and is not yet ready for full-blooded debate with someone like me, duplicitous and odious. The technicals are fine, he said, or will be quite shortly when I have climbed on top of them, mastered my brief, banged a few heads together and assured the nation, on primetime TV, that the only problem with Britain is media scaremongering and misrepresentation, people like you, duplicitous and odious if superficially charming. Have some more capon neck. Do try the syllabub. I said: I thought we were in Queer Street. Nonsense, guffawed the chancellor. Balderdash and codswallop. You make things up. You ought to be taking pills. What an imagination. The only problems Britain has are inside your head. Look at Wednesday's Epsom Derby. A magnificent national festival. The Queen looking . . . radiant. Ditto the Queen Mother. A record Pounds 754,300 in prizemoney and a titanic, pulsating win for Commander In Chief which quickened like a good 'un, a legend in the making - another feather in the cap of his sire, Dancing Brave, which I believe I recall you profiled once. I said: Dancing Brave's in Japan. He was cast out and exported. In any case, Wednesday's Derby was another national calamity. There was a hot-shot favourite, Tenby by name, which was backed to odds-on - thanks to the racing media: what a dozy lot - and finally finished tenth, enriching the bookies by millions. The amount of money lost by poor people on Tenby, chancellor, was just another nail in the national coffin. Get along with you, roared the chancellor. As you've just admitted, the only reason that Tenby was odds-on favourite was because a lot of stupid racing hacks who couldn't pick a winner if its name was etched in letters of flaming gold 1,000ft tall in the sky above Newmarket said he should be favourite. Let me repeat myself: the only thing wrong with Britain is media scaremongering and misrepresentation - plus incompetence. Have you tried the goose? If you open that drawer you'll find a first-rate piece of Stilton. I said: What about our institutions? From the monarchy and parliament down they have all been exposed, during the low tide of recession, as the blackened and rotting piles of a crazily-tilting pier. What is the government doing about it? There you go again, beamed the chancellor. You set one hare running and then you set another in an endless, senseless flip-flop of non sequiturs. Slow down. Keep calm. We have put the recession behind us. We have sacked Norman Lamont. John Major is a broken man. I am now in charge. And what I say to you is - have you tried the woodpigeon with chestnuts and cabbage? A supremely English dish. Goes particularly well with cider . . .</p>

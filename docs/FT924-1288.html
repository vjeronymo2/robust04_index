			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Austria's only aluminium smelter to close AUSTRIA'S ONLY aluminium smelter in Ranshofen is finally set to close at the end of the year. The state-owned aluminium company Austria Metall (Amag), which operates the smelter, has also put up for sale two international smelting operations in order to reduce its mounting losses. Over the past few years, Ranshofen's output has been cut to 30,000 tonnes a year from 80,000 tonnes as falling world aluminium prices have made it impossible to turn a profit. In addition Amag is trying to sell its 20 per cent interest in the Australian smelter Boyns, which has an annual capacity of 46,000 tonnes, and its 33.3 per cent stake in Aluminiumschmelze Hamburg, a 46,000-tonnes-a-year smelter in northern Germany. No buyers have yet been found.</p>

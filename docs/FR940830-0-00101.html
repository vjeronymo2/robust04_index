			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 23. Section 968.330 is amended by revising paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) introductory text, (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(4), (e)(8), (f), (g)(1), (g)(2) introductory text, (g)(2)(i), (h), (i), and (j); by adding a new paragraph (k); and by adding the OMB control number to the end of the section, to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;968.330 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  Annual Submission of activities and expenditures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Annual Submission is a collective term for all documents which the PHA must submit to HUD for review and approval before accessing the current FFY grant funds. Such documents include the Annual Statement, Work Statements for years two through five of the Five-Year Action Plan, local government statement, PHA Board Resolution, materials demonstrating the partnership process and any other documents as prescribed by HUD. For planning purposes, a PHA may use either the amount of funding received in the current year or the actual formula amount provided in HUD's notification under &sect;968.315(b)(1) in developing the Five-Year Action Plan for presentation at the resident meetings and public hearing. Work Statements cover the second through the fifth years of the Five-Year Action Plan and set forth the major work categories and costs by development or PHA-wide which the PHA intends to undertake in each year of years two through five. In preparing these Work Statements, the PHA shall assume that the current FFY formula amount will be available in each year of years two through five. The Work Statements for all five years will be at the same level of detail so that the PHA may interchange work items as discussed in &sect;968.320(d)(5)(i). A PHA may budget up to 8% of its annual grant in a contingency account for cost overruns. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Submission. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  After receiving HUD notification of the formula amount and estimating how much funding will be available from other sources, such as State and local governments, and determining its activities and costs based on the current FFY formula amount, the PHA shall submit its Annual Submission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Acceptance for review. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) Upon receipt of an Annual Submission from a PHA, HUD shall determine whether: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The Annual Submission contains each of the required components; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The PHA has submitted any additional information or assurances required as a result of HUD monitoring, findings of inadequate PHA performance, audit findings, and civil rights compliance findings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the PHA has submitted a complete Annual Submission and all required information and assurances, HUD will accept the submission for review, as of the date of receipt. If the PHA has not submitted all required material, HUD will promptly notify the PHA that it has disapproved the submission, indicating the reasons for disapproval, the modifications required to qualify the Annual Submission for HUD review, and the date by which such modifications must be received by HUD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Resident and local government participation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A PHA is required to develop its Annual Submission, including any proposed amendments to its Comprehensive Plan as provided in &sect;968.320 (b) and (c), in consultation with officials of the appropriate governing body (or, in the case of a PHA with developments in multiple jurisdictions, in consultation with the CEO of each such jurisdiction or with an advisory group representative of all jurisdictions) and with residents and duly elected resident councils of the developments covered by the Comprehensive Plan, as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Public notice. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Within a reasonable amount of time before the advance meeting for residents under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and the public hearing under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the PHA shall annually provide public notice of the advance meeting and the public hearing in a manner determined by the PHA and which ensures notice to all duly elected resident councils; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Advance Meeting with residents. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The PHA shall at least annually hold a meeting open to all residents and duly elected resident councils. The advance meeting shall be held within a reasonable amount of time before the public hearing under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. The PHA will provide residents with information concerning the contents of the PHA's Five-Year Action Plan (and any proposed amendments to the PHA's Comprehensive Plan to be submitted with the Annual Submission) so that residents can comment adequately at the public hearing on the contents of the Five-Year Action Plan and any proposed amendments to the Comprehensive Plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Public hearing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The PHA shall annually hold at least one public hearing, and any appropriate number of additional hearings, to present information on the Annual Submission and the status of prior approved programs. The public hearing shall provide ample opportunity for residents of the developments covered by the Comprehensive Plan, officials of the appropriate governing body, and other interested parties, to express their priorities and concerns. The PHA shall give full consideration to the comments and concerns of residents, local government officials, and other interested parties in developing its Five-Year Action Plan, or any amendments to its Comprehensive Plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Expedited scheduling. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  PHAs are encouraged to hold the meeting with residents and duly elected resident councils under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and the public hearing under paragraph (d)(3) of this section between July 1 ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  after the end of the program year_June 30) and September 30, using the formula amount for the current FFY. If a PHA elects to use such expedited scheduling, it must explain at the meeting with residents and duly elected resident councils and at the public hearing that the current FFY amount is not the actual grant amount for the subsequent year, but is rather the amount used for planning purposes. It must also explain that the Five-Year Action Plan will be adjusted when HUD provides notification of the actual formula amount, and explain which major work categories at which developments may be added or deleted to adjust for the actual formula amount and that any added work categories/developments will come from the Comprehensive Plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

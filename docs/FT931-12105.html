			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / As They Say In Europe: Celebrating with an old mistress - Do you remember Sarajevo? James Morgan explains a lovers' tiff THE FRENCH press has been celebrating the 30th anniversary of friendship with Germany. It has done so in the manner that a mistress might celebrate the 30th anniversary of an affair in which the man has not done the decent thing. Nowadays, Germany spends even less time with its lover, devoting more attention to its poverty stricken cousins. As a result, perhaps, it willingly pays billions to maintain that jewel of the relationship, the French franc, in pristine condition - just to keep the old girl quiet. Le Monde likes this but is critical of the way Germany organises its domestic affairs: '. . . the great neighbour beyond the Rhine is even renouncing financial and budgetary balance which is foreseen in the Maastricht Treaty. Germany is no longer worthy of the model it created.' The rest of the press clings to the exchange rate as the symbol of the Franco-German motor behind the construction of Europe, even though it is driving France into the ground. Le Figaro remarked, wistfully, that the balance of forces since the creation of the partnership had been reversed, 'which should not make France forget Germany has need of her.' This is not wholly appreciated in Germany. The publicity given to the anniversary was far less there than west of the Rhine. And signs of hostility are growing. A refrain of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung these days is that France is not pulling its weight against Serbia. It publicises Bosnian politicians who say that Paris (and London) supports Belgrade. This week the chief fulminator of that powerful paper, Johann Georg Reissmuller returned from his long hagiographic hibernation in Croatia, to accuse France, along with Serbia, of having disrupted the twentieth century. 'The successful murder attack against the heir to the Austrian throne was the prelude to the first world war in which France and Serbia stood side by side.' Surely there was a bit more to the 1914-18 affair than that. The account continued with how, in the inter-war years, Serbia tried to dominate the south Slav kingdom. France promoted it as a counterweight to Italy, actively promoting expansionism. In the second world war, 'Tito fought against Hitler and Mussolini because he wanted a Bolshevik Yugoslavia.' The subsequent 'Tito-state' rivalled the Soviet Union in brutality. And when President Mitterrand fetched up in Sarajevo last June it was certainly not to stop the Serbs. As an account of the past 80 years, Reissmuller's story leaves a few gaps - such as the Austrian ultimatum to Serbia in 1914 which was designed to start a war. Then there was the creation by Germany of the Croatian fascist state in 1941. And, of course, Tito was not a Serb - he was half Croat and half Slovene - and the Serbs knew it. It is one thing to argue that the men who run Serbia today are horrible and mad. It is another to offer passionate support to one side or the other in this affair. In the week where the Croats broke a ceasefire, killing two French UN soldiers in the process, the German papers said that was all they could do in the circumstances. Perhaps someone in western Europe could face up to this question: do the leading members of the Community have different foreign policy interests or not? The Germans, it seems, have those of 1914, at least when seen from the perspective of Reissmuller. If they have not changed, have those of France and Britain? And, the most vital issue of all, what will Russia do if Germany sets out to teach Serbia a lesson? All this occurs in the week when the US appears to have accepted that Germany and Japan should become permanent members of the Security Council. Why not, if Germany, at least, is rediscovering the notion of the national interest? The Security Council has been getting rather dull. Britain has the fewest problems in dealing with with this evolving situation. The French papers rightly believe that Britain has returned to a kind of isolationism and ask where this leaves France and its friendship with Germany. Writing in La Tribune Desfosses, Philippe Labarde says: 'Who has profited most from this strange marriage? According to the polls in each country it is always the other.' He adds, hopefully, that the essence is that France and Germany believe in the same model of society. The two draw closer together to pass through hard tests. 'This is in order to forget that less than 50 years ago it seemed to them both to be just as evident that they had to make war.' It is a tedious cliche to remark on the nightmarish coincidence that it should be Sarajevo that is at the centre of so many anxieties. But the parallels with 1914 run deeper: the city could again symbolise the real differences that exist between France and Germany. Surely nobody in Germany can want to pick a fight over that all over again . . . James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

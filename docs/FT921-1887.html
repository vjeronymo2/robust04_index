			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Arts: Dance of death, betrayal and remorse - Clement Crisp hails 'The Judas Tree', Kenneth MacMillan's new work for the Royal Ballet SIR KENNETH MacMillan's The Judas Tree was given its first performance by the Royal Ballet at Covent Garden on Thursday night. On its most immediate level it concerns harsh and all too familiar incidents of urban brutality. Jock McFadyen has made brilliant designs of a building site - ladders, walk-ways, unfinished walls, two derelict motor cars - peopled by a group of workmen under a foreman (Irek Mukhamedov). A girl, Viviana Durante, is brought in, sexually predatory and flirtatious, who provokes jealousy between the foreman and one of his friends (Michael Nunn). She is eventually subjected to gang-rape by the men, is killed, and the foreman accuses his friend of her death. The friend is murdered. The foreman hangs himself. The girl reappears as a grieving memory and reproach for what has happened. The curtain falls. Violence is the common-place of life in many cities: last week a report told of appalling gang-rape in the Halles district of Paris. MacMillan's argument  -and it is one sustained with extraordinary choreographic imagination - is that beneath the animal crudities of the incident, we may learn about the human condition, and a continuum of human suffering and remorse. This he relates through a series of emotionally resonant images, and through actions mysteriously and subtly revelatory of his larger theme. Betrayal is explicit in the narrative. In Mukhamedov's staggering performance - the role is black in tone, but shot through with the man's need for love and his mistrust of that love - we know both sympathy and despair (but mainly sympathy) for this combination of brute power and vulnerability. With Durante we see a girl whose sexual bravado and street-smart personality are a mere shell which is shattered by her terrible suffering. In her relationship with every man on stage (she is one woman faced with 14 men) we must consider both the battle between the sexes and a battle for sexual equality - or supremacy. When she first appears, she is carried in under a white sheet, and at moments throughout the action she dons this as a symbol of her untouched and, I would suggest, inviolable femininity, which must eventually be recognised as that of a mother. That, at the end of the piece, she acquires yet another identity - the grief-laden figure of the Stabat mater - is the haunting last note of the ballet. For, at the deepest level of MacMillan's creation, lies the historical Judas. The references are fleeting, but clear. After the girl's death - and it has been mysteriously presaged by Mukhamedov's drawing round her recumbent body with chalk, just as police used to outline the body of a corpse - Mukhamedov betrays and accuses Nunn with a kiss. Nunn's body is placed in one of the ruined cars at the back of the stage - a latter-day Christ in his tomb - and Mukhamedov, like Judas, hangs himself. It is then that Durante, draped in the unstained white of the cloth, stands like the Virgin Mother. These various levels of interpretation would be mere cleverness were they not shown to us in dance of the most searching - and revealing - imagery. Identity, motive, feeling, speak through movement unfailingly expressive. Durante's ambiguous relationship with Mukhamedov and Nunn is made clear to us as Nunn carries her above the recumbent Mukhamedov, her feet treading over the his body. (A woman aggressively 'walking over men' is a recurrent image). The weak 'friend", so well played by Nunn, is given a questioning, ambiguous solo in which his indecisions are exposed. (He finds refuge with Durante under her white sheet, who thereby becomes a mother-figure.) The group of workmen indulge in games, races, that speak of suppressed sexual energy, undirected physicality, ill-defined but pungent menace. Mukhamedov is by turns dominant - astonishing in physical prowess - and broodingly dangerous as he 'fingers' a character in accusation. There is much to discover in the dance. With The Judas Tree MacMillan has again challenged ballet's perceptions about its own identity: he shows the human condition, in actual and symbolic terms, as the central matter of a dance theatre that he continues to enrich. He has also brought two welcome new talents to the Opera House stage. Jock McFadyen's designs are bold, sure. Brian Elias' score is powerful as drama atmospheric in sonorities, providing an urgent motor force for the action. The Opera House orchestra under Barry Wordsworth were fine advocates for it, in an evening which also brought distinguished accounts of Stravinsky's violin concerto and Bizet's symphony in C. Of these, and their bright danced performances, I shall hope to report after a further viewing of this triple bill - which I would urge dance-lovers to see. The interpretations given by Durante, Mukhemedov Nunn, and their colleagues in The Judas Tree are magnificent. Brian Elias' score for The Judas Tree, writes Andrew Clements, is a sustained and often striking achievement, far more direct in its imagery than his earlier orchestral works. Given a totally free hand by MacMillan, Elias has produced a continuously unfolding span of music, whose events were apparently informed by a private scenario of the composer's own devising, but one which makes perfectly coherent sense as an abstract musical argument. With a five-part structure containing a set of variations, fully worked slow movement and a tumultuous coda which pulls together many of the musical threads, there is more than a hint of a latter-day symphony behind The Judas Tree. It is a feeling enhanced by the carrying-over of thematic shards from one section to the next binding the structure ever tighter. Many of the ideas are vivid; much of the melodic writing, for woodwind especially, has a sharp tang. Doubts about the pacing creep in shortly before the climactic coda, for the fourth section seems heavy on noisy, routine rhetoric in contrast with the thoughtful plotting of the earlier argument. There is plenty to absorb however, and ample substance to justify a transfer to the concert hall, where the proof that Elias' images are as compelling and haunting as MacMillan's choreographic ones could finally be tested.</p>

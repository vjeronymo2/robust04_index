Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> BRAZIL PROBE FINDS A-BOMB PLAN  </P> <P> The Brazilian Congress, after the most thorough probe yet of the country's  nuclear programs, says it has established that the nation's former military  rulers intended to build an atomic bomb.  </P> <P> "At a historic moment there was a decision, taken within the Planalto Palace --  the seat of government -- to build a nuclear (weapon)," a congressional  committee of inquiry said in its conclusions made public today.  </P> <P> The military ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985, and the legislators said it was  under the last of the five military presidents, Gen. Joao Figueiredo, that the  government decided to make a nuclear bomb.  </P> <P> The current civilian administration of President Fernando Collor de Mello has  pledged not to make nuclear weapons.  </P></p>

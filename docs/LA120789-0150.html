			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> IT'S A NATURAL: SIMILAR SERRA AND LOMPOC COLLIDE FOR CROWN  </P> <P> Serra High football Coach Leo Hand sees many similarities between his Cavaliers  and the Lompoc Braves.  </P> <P> Both are quick. Both run unorthodox offenses. And both boast perfect records  this season.  </P> <P> Mostly, though, Hand believes that Serra and Lompoc deserve to play for the  CIF-Southern Section Division VII title at 7:30 Saturday night at El Camino  College. It's no fluke when the top seed (Lompoc) ends up meeting the No. 2  seed (Serra) in the finals.  </P> <P> "I think Lompoc is well-suited for us, and we're well-suited for them," said  Serra's first-year coach. "It should be a great game."  </P> <P> In the only Southern Section final matching unbeaten teams, Serra will put its  13-0 record and hard-hitting reputation on the line against a Lompoc team that  is also 13-0 and features perhaps the best running back in the division.  </P> <P> Tailback Napolean Kaufman has been virtually unstoppable, averaging 9.5 yards  per carry on his way to 2,051 yards rushing. The 5-foot-8, 155-pound junior has  scored 35 touchdowns five ways: 28 on runs, two on pass receptions, two on  interceptions, two on kickoff returns and one on a punt return.  </P> <P> His versatility obviously poses problems for Serra, but Hand says it would be a  big mistake to overlook the other starters in Lompoc's wing-T backfield.  Quarterback Jason Garife has passed for 972 yards and eight touchdowns and  rushed for 588 yards and 10 TDs. Fullback Milton Royster has rushed for 704  yards and eight TDs.  </P> <P> In defeating Mira Costa, Chaminade and Temple City in the playoffs, the Braves  have averaged 42 points a game.  </P> <P> "We have to defense everybody," Hand said. "We just can't zero in on (Kaufman)  and leave ourselves vulnerable to the other players."  </P> <P> Serra's aggressive defense is coming off perhaps its best effort last week in a  12-3 semifinal win over Notre Dame of Sherman Oaks. The Cavaliers gave up 185  total yards and forced five turnovers. Jerald Henry had two interceptions,  sophomore Chris Long had one pick-off, and Louis Laffitte and Rodney Lands  recovered fumbles.  </P> <P> Serra's full-house backfield has accounted for 3,882 yards and 57 rushing  touchdowns. Fullback Dennis Gerard leads the team with 1,681 yards and 26  touchdowns, but halfback Lamont Daniel (956 yards, 10 TDs) has been the leading  rusher each of the last two games. He had 134 yards on 14 carries last week.  </P> <P> Hand said he will not hesitate to use backup quarterback Alex Marcelin if the  situation calls for it. Marcelin, the team's passing specialist, played most of  the game against Notre Dame and completed a 34-yard touchdown pass to wide  receiver Donald Godden, who has scoring catches in Serra's three playoff games.  </P> <P> Both teams are seeking their school's first CIF football title. A bridesmaid  five times, Lompoc is making its sixth appearance in the finals. Serra will  make its second trip to the finals, having lost to Schurr in the 1980  Southeastern Conference title game.  </P> <P> In the L.A. City 4-A semifinals:  </P> <P> Carson (9-1) vs. Crenshaw (8-4) at Veterans Stadium, 7:30 p.m. Friday -- The  Pacific League champion Colts face third-place Crenshaw in a rematch of a game  won by Carson, 39-12, on Nov. 17.  </P> <P> "I've never cared for playing someone we've played before," Carson Coach Gene  Vollnogle said. "It's tough to get the kids to come back and play a good game.  It's the same problem we've had against Banning."  </P> <P> Vollnogle hopes his defense, anchored by middle linebacker Nkosi Littleton, can  keep Crenshaw running back Kevin Hicks in check. Hicks has led Crenshaw to  playoff wins over San Fernando and Taft of Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Carson, the defending 4-A champion, is coming off a 31-0 victory  over Kennedy of Granada Hills after drawing a bye in the first round. The Colt  offense was paced by quarterback Armin Youngblood, who passed for three scores  to give him a single-season school record of 27 touchdown throws.  </P> <P> Youngblood has completed 107 of 212 attempts for 2,135 yards. His primary  receiver, Michael Ross, has 42 catches for 803 yards and 14 TDs.  </P> <P> Carson is down to its third-string left offensive tackle after Ben Leui  suffered a separated shoulder last week, but Vollnogle is confident Frank  Padilla and Junior Auelua can do the job.  </P></p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Shareholders attack Saatchi's failure to pay dividend SHAREHOLDERS at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's annual meeting yesterday expressed dissatisfaction at the advertising group's failure to pay a 1992 dividend, though a Pounds 73m rights issue announced on May 19 received overwhelming approval at the extraordinary meeting which followed. One shareholder criticised director Mr Charles Saatchi for again failing to attend the meeting while receiving what the speaker described as 'the infamous salary' of Pounds 312,500. Mr Saatchi, like his brother Maurice, chairman of the company, was entitled to twice that figure, but agreed to waive half. The two men have sold the rights to buy 502,417 ordinary shares, raising Pounds 145,700, which they will use to subscribe for 116,718 of the shares in the rights issue. Three other company directors have also disposed of ordinary share rights. After the June 11 rights issue the brothers will have a combined holding of 1.7m shares. The company is offering 59.4m new ordinary shares at 130p each, on the basis of 10 new shares for every 27 held. Mr Charles Scott, chief executive, told the meeting he expected the company to return to dividend payments for 1994.</p>

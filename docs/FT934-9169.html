			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Money Markets: Bundesbank cautious MONEY market rates across Europe remained stable after the Deutsche Bundesbank's latest round of securities repurchase agreements reaffirmed its return to a more cautious approach to interest rate easing, writes Conner Middelmann. The lowest accepted rate on the 14-day repo tranche slipped one basis point to 6.38 per cent and the minimum 28-day rate declined by two basis points, also to 6.38 per cent. The bulk of two-week bids was accepted at an unchanged 6.39 per cent, while the bulk of four-week bids was taken at 6.39 per cent to 6.40 per cent. The allocation resulted in a modest DM1.3bn liquidity injection and left German overnight money trading little changed around 6.45 per cent. 'After their surprise rate cuts on October 21, they have slammed on the brakes again,' said a Frankfurt money market trader. Nevertheless, most traders are expecting another cut in the Bundesbank's leading interest rates in December. German short-term interest rate futures eased back slightly following the repo, with the December three-month Euro-mark contract down 0.03 point at 93.84 and the March contract off 0.04 at 94.54 in late trading. The sterling money market had another lacklustre day which left the short sterling futures contract drifting on moderate volume in a rela-tively narrow range. The December contract eased 0.03 point to 94.46. That indicates that the market is still discounting a  1/2 percentage point reduction in the base rate by December, with most traders betting on a cut accompanying the November 30 Budget. The Bank of England forecast a Pounds 1.25bn shortage in the morning which was later revised to Pounds 1.3bn. It did not operate in the money market in the morning, but purchased bills totalling Pounds 779m in the afternoon, followed by Pounds 420m of late assistance. The Bank's operations had little effect on money market rates, traders said. 'The Bank's stance is broadly neutral right now and trying to glean monetary policy indica-tions from their day-to-day operations is mostly a pointless exercise,' commented a money trader, who added that this neutral strategy is likely to continue until closer to Budget Day. However, 'the Bank may get more aggressive if speculation becomes more feverish', he said.</p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / International Company News: Chargeurs ahead at FFr712m CHARGEURS, the French industrial group with interests in textiles and transport, saw net profits rise by 76 per cent from FFr404m to FFr712m (Dollars 148.02m) in the first half. The group last year returned to recovery after two years of heavy losses in its wool textile and communications interests, which include a stake in BSkyB, the UK satellite television service. Chargeurs has since restructured its activities, notably by selling its UTA airline interests to Air France. Group turnover rose by 2.6 per cent from FFr5.29bn to FFr5.42bn in the first six months of 1992. Operating profits rose 57 per cent from FFr203m to FFr319m. Earnings per share were 71 per cent higher at FFr114.6, from FFr67.1.</p>

			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Futures firm STERLING futures ended the day firmer yesterday after the Bank of England intervened heavily on the foreign exchanges to support the pound. September short sterling lost around 50 basis points in the first two days of the week. At the start of a morning of wild trading, the contract rose 15 basis points to a high of 89.20 after the Bank of England bought around Pounds 1bn of sterling on the currency markets. The contract then lost 10 basis points after a Bundesbank Council member said that a realignment of the European Monetary System could take place. His comments were countered and the contract closed at 89.15, up 10 basis points from its previous close. The December contract finished 9 basis points firmer at 89.17. Both prices are still discounting a base rate rise of more than  1/4 percentage point. Interbank rates in the sterling cash market also softened in the wake of the intervention. Three-month money closed at 10 13/16 per cent, down  1/8 per cent on the offered side. The one-year rate closed down 1/16 per cent at 10 15/16 per cent. The outlook for both of these rates will depend on how well the Bank's intervention works. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 900m in the morning, which was quickly taken out. Clearing banks and discount houses have bought bills from the commercial sector at rates that correspond to 10 per cent base rate. Once again, they offered paper to the Bank of England quickly, fearing a rise in the Bank's dealing rates. The Bank bought Pounds 100m of Band 1 and Pounds 16m of Band 2 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 50m of Band 3 Treasury bills and Pounds 612m of Band 3 bank bills at 9 3/4 per cent, Pounds 15m of Band 4 Treasury bills and Pounds 137m of Band 4 Bank bills at 9 per cent. The Bank revised the forecast to a shortage of Pounds 1.05bn in the afternoon and provided late assistance of Pounds 20m. The Bundesbank helped to ease tensions on the foreign exchanges in the morning by adding DM3.3bn of liquidity to the German money markets in its weekly operations. Traders quoted call money at 9.65-9.75 per cent. Most of the activity took place at 9.70 per cent. On Tuesday it was quoted at 9.70-9.75 per cent.</p>

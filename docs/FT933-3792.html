			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Germany wants eastern Europe in Nato and EC GERMANY yesterday added its backing to a push for the integration of eastern Europe with western institutions, including Nato, the European Community, and the Western European Union. In a restatement of German foreign policy, Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, spelt out a series of ways in which he would seek to promote enlargement both of Nato and the EC to include the central European democracies, without alienating Russia and Ukraine. In Brussels, Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, also supported the goal of future membership of the alliance for the countries of central and eastern Europe. He told the annual conference of the International Institute of Strategic Studies in Brussels that an enlarged Nato would increase the stability of the whole of Europe and be in the interest of all nations, including Russia and Ukraine'. Mr Kinkel pledged his government's firm support for the creation of a European Union - including European monetary union and a common foreign and security policy. His plans included joint peacekeeping and peacemaking operations by the western and eastern members of the North Atlantic Co-operation Council - which includes Nato and the former eastern bloc states. He proposed that the WEU, the intended arm of EC defence co-operation, should offer association status to all candidates for membership of the community, including central and east European countries. And he said that Nato should declare its willingness to make bilateral agreements on security co-operation with all countries seeking membership of the future integrated EC. Mr Kinkel's plans for eastern Europe, announced to a foreign policy congress of his Free Democratic party in Bonn, are the most specific and radical to have been put forward by a leading member of the Nato alliance. They may well be seen as over-hasty by other allies but they reflect concern in top German circles over the need to integrate eastern and western Europe, to counter political, economic and social instability. Mr Worner's statement is the clearest signal to date that Nato is prepared to accept Poland, the Czech republic, Hungary, Slovakia and other central European states provided they meet standards on human rights, democracy and the protection of ethnic minorities.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / How To Spend It: That old black magic - Nowhere is it more true that 'you are what you wear' than at formal evening occasions. Get it wrong and you risk being deeply embarrassed. John Morgan deciphers the correct dress code and etiquette 'MEN'S EVENING WEAR is a funny thing. If it is right, nothing is more attractive, distinguished and handsome. But if it is wrong, it can make the wearer look irredeemably naff, uncomfortable or vulgar, or possibly all three at the same time. Problems arise not only from laziness and ignorance, but from an inability to understand that evening dress has a set of conventions. Knowing when and how to break the rules is the secret to getting it right au soir. The use of colour is something many men get wrong. When an invitation says black tie, it should be taken literally. Unless you are wearing a smoking jacket, stick to the monochromatic purity established by Beau Brummell at the beginning of the 19th century. Coloured bow ties (particularly tomato-red ones) are the worst offenders and should be left to badly brought-up school boys. Gaudy waistcoats are less grim, but best avoided. Dinner jackets and evening tails must be blue-black, not ordinary black, which can take on an unfortunate green tinge in artificial light and lend its wearer a rather mouldy appearance. The cloth should be a plain worsted barathea. Fancy cloths are, as Hugh Holland of Kilgour French &amp; Stanbury says, 'fine for East End villains and club bouncers, but not for gentlemen'. He is also damning about white dinner jackets. 'These seem to find favour with motor traders and certain City types (ex-motor traders).' I think they look fine in the tropics. The classic cut for a dinner jacket is single-breasted with double-breasted (peaked) lapels, but most men seem to prefer jackets with a double-breasted cut. These should fit the body closely and not have pocket flaps or vents (Hackett's jackets have a good shape). The correct button configuration is button one, show two; this gives an elegant hour-glass shape and exposes a generous tranche of lapel facing. Lapels can be faced in black ribbed silk or satin (the former is more distinguished). Buttons should be covered in the same cloth as the lapels. Trousers, modelled on old military styles, should be tapered, with one row of braid and never with turn-ups. Cummerbunds look passe these days. They can also be awkward to wear. I shall never forget seeing a fat, inebriated main ending up with one around his chest, looking as though he had on a large velvet bra. More and more men are wearing evening waistcoats again. These should be made of a light, rich silk that matches the facing of the jacket. They can be V-shaped or horseshoe-shaped and should have covered buttons. Shirts and collars may cause problems for the uninformed. These should be white and have marcella or knife-pleated fronts. I adore the cotton voile evening shirts from Budd Shirtmakers, although, as Sara Haydon of Hogg Sons &amp; JB Johnstone, points out, 'they are best avoided by fat men with hairy chests, as little is less appealing than simian sproutings from soft cotton voile'. Collars should be turned down. Wing collars, including the horrendous variety that come attached to shirts, should never be worn with a dinner jacket. Shawl collars are starting to look acceptable again, particularly on double-breasted jackets. The right accessories make or break a evening outfit. It goes without saying that the bow tie must be a real one, in silk barathea or ribbed silk, not satin or velvet. Studs and cufflinks should not be flashy and preferably be period pieces (Bentley &amp; Co) and Longmire of St James's have an elegant selection). Shoes, either pumps with grosgrain bows or whole-cut (without a cap) lace-ups with silk ribbon, have to be patent (Edward Green and Cleverley both sell excellent ones). Socks ought to be knee-length and made of silk. Evening clothes, like any others, are subject to ever-changing fashions and social habits. Often casual clothes of 'one generation become the formal ones of the next. My grandparents would have considered a dinner jacket only a semi-formal evening attire and would have been confused by the recent fashion for wearing velvet outside your own house. But, today, richly coloured velvet smoking jackets are to be seen in country house parties across the land, particularly in Scotland. 'North of the Border, most men wear them. I saw a brace of Dukes looking splendid in their grandfathers' smoking jackets at a recent dinner party,' says Rory Wolfe Murray of' Buckleigh. The Nehru jacket is also a popular innovation and is an ideal way of wearing a shirt with no bow tie. Hiring evening dress is questionable, perhaps the only exception being white tie, which is still required kit at the grandest official functions. It is worn with matching trousers with two rows of braid, a white marcella waistcoat, a boiled tunic shirt with a starched front, a detachable stiff collar and a white bow tie. White silk scarves are naff and wristwatches should never be worn with white tie. Whether you choose to wear black or white tie, do not mix up their elements. It is not smart to be over-dressed and it is rude to outshine your hosts. It could be argued that when it comes to dressing successfully for the evening it is true indeed that manners maketh man.</p>

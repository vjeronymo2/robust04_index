			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Portillo stresses need for incentives MR MICHAEL PORTILLO, chief Treasury secretary, last night gave a fresh hint that the government was disinclined to raise income tax or corporation tax in the November Budget. In a speech focusing on declining European competitiveness, Mr Portillo argued that low rates of both these taxes acted as an important lure for mobile entrepreneurial talent and investment capital. The EC was pricing its workers out of jobs by putting too little emphasis on productivity, profitability and labour market flexibility and too much on welfare, he warned. Mr Portillo urged member states to reform their social security systems 'not only to contain growth in costs to a sustainable level but to give people greater incentives to work and save'. His remarks came within 24 hours of Mr Kenneth Clarke's hint that any Budget tax increases would be on spending rather than incomes.</p>

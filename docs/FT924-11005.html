			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Straw attacks homes 'crisis' LABOUR yesterday launched a five-point plan designed to end Britain's 'biggest housing crisis since the war'. Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, accused the government of 'perverse economics' in preventing local authorities from using their own funds to help solve the shortage of accommodation. He called for: The government to use empty repossessed houses for homeless families; Court orders for repossessions to be refused until the lenders offered practical help and advice to people in arrears, with options of accepting reduced payments for a limited period; The government to ensure that mortgage rescue schemes, which had so far failed, could be made to work towards helping those owners in difficulties remain in their homes as tenants; The introduction of effective shared ownership schemes involving the payment of lower mortgages in return for giving the lender or housing association an equity share in the home; An end to constraints on local authorities using capital receipts worth Pounds 5bn. Mr Straw said: 'The housing market is facing its biggest crisis since the war. A million people live in homes worth less than they paid for them, house prices are going through the floor, while repossessions and homelessness are at unacceptable levels. 'Labour believes that cost-effective measures can be taken to stem repossessions and to stimulate the market.'</p>

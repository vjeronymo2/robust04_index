			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian wool prices nosedive Australian wool prices nosedived at sales this week after soaring since the start of the 1994-95 season, reports Reuters from Sydney. But industry officials said the market remained well supported. The newly reweighted eastern Australian market indicator had soared to an end-week high of 829 cents a kilogram (clean) from 681 cents at the start of the current wool season on July 1, before slipping slightly last week to close at 808 cents. But at the Newcastle and Melbourne auctions this week the indicator fell by 37 cents to 771 cents on Tuesday, and traders were expecting further retrenchment as the market entered its period of peak offerings. 'This is the correction everyone has been waiting for as the market has been rising so quickly,' suggested Mr Peter Klein, assistant director of the Wool Council of Australia.</p>

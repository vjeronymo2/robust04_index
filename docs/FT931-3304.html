			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Deutsche Babcock sees fall in earnings Correction (published 18th March 1993) appended to this article. DEUTSCHE BABCOCK, the plant and engineering group, posted a 22 per cent increase in sales in the five months to the end of February but warned that overall profits for the year would be lower than expected. Sales in the five months rose to DM2.5bn (Dollars 1.5bn), with the order backlog standing at DM8.8bn, a 22.3 per cent rise over the same period the previous year. But Mr Heyo Schmiedeknecht, chief executive, warned that profit forecasts for the current year, which ends on September 30, would have to be 'revised downward'. He said profits would be 'closer to DM30m'. Earlier forecasts said profits could be as high as DM60m. Mr Schmiedeknecht blamed the general recession in the industrial machines sector. He also said that core businesses in environmental technology continued to be in the red. Net profits for the group for the 1992 fiscal year stood at DM76m however, up from DM32m the previous year. Sales for the same period reached DM7.6bn against DM7.3bn the year before. Outstanding orders were higher than the previous year, standing at DM7.1bn against DM6.6bn. The company said it had won a contract worth DM240m to build a coal-fired plant in China. The company said it still planned to float three subsidiaries on the German stock market this year. The plan was announced last year but had to be delayed because of the stock market turmoil, a company spokesman said. The three subsidiaries are Balcke-Durr, Babcock-BGH and Schumag, specialists in mechanical engineering, plant and industrial technology. The company will also pay a preferred dividend this year, but will omit to pay on common shares. Holders of preferred stock will receive DM9 a share, or three times the DM3 a share which was last paid out in 1988. The company said it intended to turn 1.2m preferred shares into common stock this year and expected to pay a DM10 dividend for the fiscal year ending September 30 1994. The plans will be proposed to its shareholders' meeting on April 5. CORRECTION The Financial Times last Tuesday incorrectly reported the forecast dividend of Deutsche Babcock. The company expects to pay a dividend of DM5 (Dollars 3) on common stock for the fiscal year ending September 30 1994.</p>

In his response to the matter of the basic peoples  congresses  yesterday, to the General Peoples Congress, the secretary for  unity said that it was highly honourable for our great Arab  people to ask its executive administration about the process of  achieving Arab unity. This serves to increase awareness, a  sense of responsiblity and revolutionary spirit among the  people, foremost among whom is the leader of the great al-fatih  revolution, the safekeeper of Arab nationalism and Arab unity  after his strategic goal crystallised. This awareness entailed  realisation of the strategic goals which threaten the existence  of the Arab nation and the resulting state of division it is in.  This reaffirms the full responsiblity to struggle to achieve  Arab unity. This was entrenched in the declaration of the  authority of the people. He reiterated his emphasis on the  unity aspiring will which is continuing for the sake of struggle  and to achieve Arab unity from the Gulf to the Sea.    The secretary [word indistinct] that the matter proves the  determination of the Libyan Arab people to follow up their  executive bodies and to take them into account for any  shortfallings in achieving Arab unity as a strategic option.  The matter also shows our peoples determination, at the  forefront who is Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, the leader of the great  al fateh revolution, to pave the way for future Arab generations  and become a model of revolutionary struggle.    This shortcoming in achieving Arab unity was resolved in  [words indistinct] fraternal bureau in Khartoum by replacing the  [words indistinct] employees there with suitable inxivixuals and  then a suitable candidate was chosen for secretary [words  indistinct]. The bureau then issued a publication to all  Libyans in the Sudan on a visit or on business, particularly  those in Khartoum and Dunqulah, to contact the bureau if they  needed help in any matter.    In a short space of time, the secretariat of the General  Peoples Committee for Unity has striven to draw up a programme  on the level of the entire Arab world and to follow up the Arab  union project which was presented by the leader to Arab heads of  state and they decided on amendments to the Arab League's  charter.    1) The secretary carried out several contacts with the  secretariat of the League of Arab States and the Arab countries  and succeeded in reviving the committee created for this purpose  after it had ceased to exist in the face of the Arab situation  in recent years.    2) A programme was devised to convene the joint higher  committees between the Great Jamahiriyah and the fraternal Arab  countries. These committees have so far met with Tunisia, Syria,  the Sudan, and Egypt and preparations are underway to convene  them with the remaining Arab countries.    3) The secretariat of the General Peoples Committee for  Unity  took upon the responsibility to draw up and implement a  programme for co-operation with Chad, the Niger, and Mali on a  new basis which takes into account the Islamic Arab ties with  these countries.    4) The secretariat of the General Peoples Committee for  Unity  followed up the activities of the Arab Maghreb Union and  participated in the various meetings, institutions, activities  and sectors.    5) The secretariat followed up the implementation of the  agreement on integration and co-operation with Egypt, and the  Sudan and prepared projects to develop co-operation to the  desired level for unity.    6) The secretariat took part in strengthening the idea of  Arab reconciliation and reaffirmed the Great Jamahiriyah's  willingness to exert efforts to bring an end to inter Arab  differences and to achieve unity.    The secretariat followed up the implementation of the Great  Jamahiriyah's participation in the activities of the Arab League  and proceeded to deal with solving political developments in the  Arab world, whether on the individual or collective level.    The secretariat resolved to deal with the matter of the lack  of presence of peoples committees in the peoples bureaus and  solved this by:    a) [no "b)" as received] Establishing a peoples committee  consisting of a secretary and members each responsible for  either integration, economic affairs, information, and cultural  affairs, to be approved by the General Peoples Committee.    The secretary of the General Peoples Committee for Unity  detailed the decrees issued by the basic peoples congresses  which were drawn up at the general peoples congress at their  session which dealt with the strategic plan for pan Arab action  which is upheld by the continuous agitation by the leader to  united the Arab world. This is the strategic framework of the  General Peoples Committee for Unity. The basis for this are the  ideas expounded by the leader since the eighties, where he  highlighted the problems of Arab security, the water crisis and  action to populate the uninhabited areas [word indistinct] Arab  map, and also the Arab union proposal.    The secretary added `The secretariat of the general peoples  congress took the following steps in order to preserve the Arab  identity south of the Sahara and the area of the Horn of Africa.  These included drawing up several agreements within the  framework of economic, social and cultural integration with its  countries, establishing joint committees to lay down executive  programmes for these agreements, ensuring that Arab culture, the  Arab language, are widely disseminated and to ensure that the  Arab Islamic and African identity of this nation is preserved.  The secretariat of the General Peoples Committee for Unity  stepped up its efforts to complete the process of integration  with the Sudan whereby the Sudanese president, Lt Gen 'Umar  Hasan al-Bashir visited the Great Jamahiriyah last year and  several Libyan and Sudanese delegations concerned with  political, economic and investment affairs exchanged visits. [no  closing quotation marks as received]    Toward this end, the secretary said that the following  measures had been taken.    The joint ministerial body convened its second session last  year in order to lay down a practical framework for  strengthening integration between the two countries in all areas.    The follow up committee last [word indistinct] convened in  order to follow up the implementation of the decisions adopted  by the ministerial body, particularly those on trade exchanges  and solving the negative aspects which are obstructing the way  to their improvement.    The value of Libyan exports for last year was about 34  million dinars matched with Sudanese imports at the same value.  This created an improvement in the level of trade compared with  the previous year, with the total value of the balance of trade  being no more than 16 million dinars.    Co-operation with Egypt: The leader conducted two visits to  the Republic of Egypt in Ay Annar [January] and Al Timour  [October]. President Muhammad Husni Mubarak also visited the  Great Jamahiriyah and co-operation and integration between the  Great Jamahiriyah and Egypt was followed up in this way.    The follow up committee which was presided over by the  secretary of the General Peoples Committee for Unity and the  minister of state for cabinet affairs in Egypt convened in the  month of al hanibal [August]. Libyan delegations from the  various sectors convened meetings with the various specialists  in Egypt particularly those concerned with education,  investment, agriculture, information, trade, electricity and  tourism. Similar Egyptian delegations visited the Great  Jamahiriyah. Meetings took place of the working committees  which were created to deal with the issue of unifying the  regions of Tubruq and Marsa Matruh, programmes were drawn up  towards this end, and their implementation will be followed up.    The Great Jamahiriyah and Egypt are bound by eleven  agreements which are on the verge of being implemented. Most  important is the agreement on the right of ownership,  employment, residence and travel. As for the matter of  residency in the Sudan or Egypt, the committee dealt with the  issue based upon the leader's insistence and belief that there  should be no difference between any Arab country and therefore  that each and every Arab citizen should have these rights in  every Arab country, and therefore that these four freedoms  should be included. Towards this end, the following measures  should be entrusted to the members of basic peoples congresses  to open the Libyan records which were prepared and to distribute  them by the secretariat of the General Peoples Committee for  Unity and the secretary of the General Peoples Committee for  Agricultural Reform, Land Reclamation and Animal Husbandry in  order to prepare a forecast with the practical measures which  should be pursued.

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: Goodyear sees third-term gains GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber, the last of the big US-owned tyre companies, yesterday predicted a strong improvement in third-quarter net income to between Dollars 130m and Dollars 135m, or 88 cents to 92 cents a share. In the same period of 1992, Goodyear earned Dollars 91m, or 64 cents, after the company's stock split. This year's third-quarter earnings will include a Dollars 5m after-tax gain from the sale of Reneer Films. Sales for the quarter are expected to be flat, excluding revenues from divested assets. Last year, Goodyear had third-quarter sales of about Dollars 3bn. The Ohio-based company attributed the gain in earnings to better productivity and the success of its premium lines of tyres. It has launched a number of tyres since 1991, when Mr Stanley Gault took the helm. Although sales were hurt by economic weakness in many countries, Goodyear's moves to improve efficiency have contributed to better operating margins. 'We are especially pleased that the operating margins generated by our business units for the period should reach our long-term objective of 10 per cent,' Mr Gault said. On Wall Street, shares in Goodyear gained Dollars 1 1/4 to a new 52-week high of Dollars 46 5/8 at mid-session.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Nicosia] </F>   [Excerpt] Authorities of [Saudi King] Fahd launched a wide  arrest campaign against elements opposed to the policy of  al-Sa'ud over the past two weeks.    Travelers from Jeddah said the arrests, carried out by  intelligence elements of Fahd's regime, included a large number  of citizens from the Kingdom's southern areas. Those arrested  include religious men and tribal chieftains who refuse the  regime's interference in Yemen's internal affairs and demand  preserving the unity of the two parts of Yemen.

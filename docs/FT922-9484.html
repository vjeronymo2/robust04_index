			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech: Kinnock attacks Tory lack of ideas THE GOVERNMENT had returned to office with no new ideas as to how to tackle Britain's underlying economic weaknesses or to build a sustained recovery, Mr Neil Kinnock told the Commons yesterday. In a confident performance, the Labour leader used his last important state occasion as leader of the opposition to highlight continuing high unemployment and the danger that tax rises or spending cuts will be needed to balance the budget. In spite of a jobless total of 2.7m, there was 'nothing new' in the government's approach and the word 'unemployment' was not even mentioned in the speech, he pointed out. Its strategy for growth was entirely consumption-led, included no measures to restore training funding, provide incentives for industrial investment or reverse the reduction in research-and-development spending. Meanwhile, Britain lay at the bottom of the Group of Seven industrialised nations' league table for growth, investment and employment. Rising to Labour cheers, Mr Kinnock began with a witty, if barbed, tribute to Mr Kenneth Baker, the former cabinet minister who moved the loyal address, and his seconder, Mr Andrew Mitchell, the MP for Gedling. In their choice of speakers, he remarked, the Tory whips had combined exuberance with experience and a loyal Heathite with a loyal Thatcherite - 'all together in the person of the Rt Hon member for Mole Valley'. Mr Baker, he added, had been described as 'capable of falling from grace without hitting the ground'. The Labour leader went on to compliment Mr Mitchell on his 'rare admission' of ambition. Some of the greatest love affairs he had ever seen in the Commons, he said, 'have been by one Honourable Member unaccompanied'. Turning to the Queen's Speech itself, Mr Kinnock said Labour could support the government's commitments to combating drug trafficking and terrorism. It also backed efforts to bring peace to Yugoslavia, push forward the process of nuclear disarmament and participate in the environment conference in Rio de Janeiro. He then went on to the attack, charging Mr John Major with failing to tackle adequately the issue of joblessness. Unemployment and the fear of unemployment were hanging over individuals, families and households, he said: 'Yet the prime minister cannot even bring himself to mention the word in this Queen's Speech.' He challenged Mr Major to say how he would rid the country of unemployment and reduce the budget deficit in the medium term. Such a goal required either growth rates in excess of those reached at the height of the boom in oil revenues, or tax increases, or public expenditure cuts. Mr Kinnock added: 'When the government says with such certainly they will get rid of the budget deficit in the medium term, they must know how they are planning to do that.' The National Lottery now to be set up was an apt symbol for policies that were making 'life itself' a gamble, with schools and hospitals opting out of local control in such a way as to make the provision of their services a matter of chance. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, urged the government to give a strong lead on Europe by moving to the narrow band of the exchange rate mechanism and ditching the 'unnecessary and damaging' opt-out clause on Britain's entry into European monetary union. Britain's European presidency was beginning at a crucial time, with many European countries facing internal difficulties. It would be 'very easy indeed' for Europe to lose momentum at this stage.</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OIL POURED INTO FOUNTAIN AT EXXON  </P> <P> Oil was poured Wednesday into a dry fountain in front of the Exxon building in  Manhattan, and a caller claiming responsibility said it was in retaliation for  the company's giant oil spill in Alaska.  </P> <P> A caller identifying himself only as an Alaskan told the Associated Press that  he and a fellow Alaskan had dumped 50 gallons of oil in the Exxon fountain,  which has been under repair.  </P> <P> The caller said the pair put the oil in the fountain so Exxon executives "might  feel a little closer to the story" of the oil that spilled March 24 from the  tanker Exxon Valdez and "to protest that it's taking a long time to clean up."  </P> <P> "It was a very small amount, and we're cleaning it up," said Vince Silvestri,  spokesman for the Rockefeller Center office complex. He said it appeared to be  motor oil.  </P></p>

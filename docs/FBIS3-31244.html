			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Sarajevo, 15 Feb (TANJUG) -- General Ratko  Mladic, commander of the general staff of the Srpska army, said  after meeting UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] commanders in  Lukavica today that there will be no withdrawal of Serb  artillery.    "We will not leave our people -- who have always lived here  -- unprotected. We have no right to do something like that and  nothing can force us to abandon our people to the mercy of the  fanatical Muslim units," he said.    Mladic held talks today with General Jean Cot, UNPROFOR  commander for the former Yugoslavia, and General Michael Rose,  UNPROFOR commander for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Deputy  Russian Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin attended a part of the  talks.    General Mladic described the talks with Generals Cot and  Rose  as very useful. "We exchanged views and I promised them we will  fully observe the cease-fire agreed on 10 February and that we  are ready to discuss any contentious issues with the other  side," he said.    Mladic recalled that it was the Muslims who started the war  against the Serbs, declaring it jointly with the Croats, and  that now the Bosnian Serbs expect that "those who declared war  on us should withdraw such a declaration now."    "When this happens at the highest political level, then  everything else will be technical detail," General Mladic said,  adding that "we are offering peace to our adversaries and we  will try to halt any combat activities in Sarajevo in the  forthcoming period."    Asked what kind of guarantees the Serb side demanded from  NATO, General Mladic said he expects that "NATO will understand  the trick of the Muslim side, which wants Sarajevo to ignite a  new world war."    "I expect all NATO members to perform their duties and  threaten the Serbs as much as the Serbs are threatening them. I  also told Cot that every member of the international forces and  humanitarian organizations has been and will be safe on our  territory. NATO should stick to its original policy --  defending the territories of those countries that created it.  If I were in the shoes of the people who make decisions in  NATO, I would not be transforming that organization into an  international beating stick, because each stick has got two ends  and does not have a part that cannot be broken," Mladic said.    Commenting on the failure of the Muslim army commander Rasim  Delic to attend the meeting, allegedly due to other business  engagements, Mladic said that "General Delic is in fact busy  with affairs in central Bosnia, where he is waging a war against  the Croats."    "However, for them this is only an excuse, because most  probably they are not going to contact us before 21 February,  expecting NATO to do their job. They are fervently hoping that  air strikes against the Serb people, villages, towns, and army  will take place and are doing everything for this to happen,"  Mladic said.    Speaking about the withdrawal of the Serb artillery from  positions surrounding Sarajevo, Mladic said that this could be  discussed only after the signing of a peace agreement.    "We will allow UN observers to be deployed at certain  positions and I will not disclose any other details in this  connection. I told General Cot what to suggest to the Muslim  side. I believe you understand that as soon as I withdraw our  forces from Sarajevo, I will leave the Serb population to be  slaughtered by the Muslims, as happened on 4 May 1992," Mladic  said.

The plenary session was attended by  members and candidate members of the UAWP Central Committee and  chairmen of the provincial and city UAWP committees.    The plenary session discussed problems of thoroughly  implementing the task elucidated by the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song in this year's New Year address and the decision of the  21st plenary session of the Sixth Party Central Committee and  the problem of thoroughly implementing the dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il's recent remarks.    Discussions were held after Choe Song-suk, chairman of the  UAWP Central Committee, gave a report on the first agenda item.    The reporter and participants in the discussions said that  the tasks elucidated by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in  his New Year address of this year and at the 21st plenary  session of the Sixth party Central Committee are a programmatic  guideline which brilliantly illuminate the road ahead for our  people accelerating the general advance of socialism of our own  style and a militant banner which actively inspires the entire  nation towards the accomplishment of the sacred cause of  national reunification and vigorously encourages it towards the  consummation of the chuche revolutionary cause.    Noting that under the wise leadership of the great leader  and  our party, the UAWP outstandingly performed the honorable  mission and duty as the reliable supporter of the party and as  the thorough defender and implementer of the party's policies  during the period of the Third Seven-Year Plan, the reporter and  participants in the discussions referred to the successes  attained in the course of vigorously carrying out the three  revolutions of ideology, technology, and culture in rural areas.    They stressed that the UAWP today faces the honorable task  of  contributing to safeguarding and defending socialism of our own  style and to further enhancing its superiority by thoroughly  implementing the party's revolutionary economic strategy.    The reporter and participants in the discussions said UAWP  organizations at all levels should set the next three years as  an adjustment period for socialist economic construction and  actively wage a struggle to thoroughly implement the party's  agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy  in this period.    Saying that all UAWP members should, above all, be brought  up  as genuine loyalists and devoted children who bear absolute  adoration and loyalty toward the great leader and the dear  comrade leader, they presented concrete measures for effectively  carrying out the ideological indoctrinations concerning the  chuche idea theory, the greatness of the party and the leader,  faithfulness, and revolutionary tradition in various forms and  methods.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: This year  is a significant year marking the 30th anniversary of the  release of the socialist rural theses. We should wage a  vigorous struggle to complete the historic task of the rural  theses and mark a new turning point in rural economic  development.    Noting that this year is a significant year marking the 30th  anniversary of the release of the socialist rural theses, the  reporter and participants in the discussions said UAWP  organizations should actively organize and mobilize all union  members to the struggle to complete the historic task of the  rural theses and to implement the party's agriculture first  policy.    They said the functions and roles of union organizations at  all levels will be further enhanced so as to contribute to  increasing grain production by consolidating the results of  irrigation and electrification, achieving mechanization and  scientification on a higher level, and implementing chuche-based  farming method in rural areas.    They stressed that, to this end, UAWP members and  agricultural workers will actively carry out political  propaganda and economic agitation [sontong] and strengthen  various mass movements, including the socialist competition  movement, so as to highly demonstrate the revolutionary spirit  of self-reliance and fortitude with the same spirit and vigor  displayed in the postwar socialist rural construction.    In the plenary session, a report was given and discussions  were held on the second agenda item.    Mentioning the tasks recently given by the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il for the working people's groups and  organizations to carry out human reform works well, the reporter  and participants said in the discussions that UAWP functionaries  should ceaselessly expand the ranks of pioneers with laudable  communist virtue in rural areas by being deeply involved with  UAWP members, actively support, encourage, and develop positive  deeds discovered among them, and widely introduce and publicize  deeds.    They stressed that UAWP works should thoroughly become the  works that will be implemented by union members. They also  stressed the reinforcement of the union rank by planning and  carrying out the organizational, ideological, and living  guidelines for the union members, and further deepening and  developing the work to create exemplary primary organizations.

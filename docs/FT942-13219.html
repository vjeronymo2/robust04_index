			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / UK Company News: McCarthy &amp; Stone cuts deficit McCarthy &amp; Stone, Britain's biggest builder of retirement homes, cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 6.1m to Pounds 400,000 in the six months to February 28. The loss before exceptional items was reduced from Pounds 5.7m to Pounds 1.2m, compared with an estimate of not more than Pounds 1.3m forecast last month when the company launched a Pounds 15.5m rights issue. There is no dividend but the company said it aims to resume payments on ordinary shares in its next financial year. Mr John McCarthy, chairman, said that increasing average sales prices and lower land costs, together with effective control of build costs and some further reductions in overhead had enabled the company to improve operating margins. 'This process should continue to produce favourable results in future periods.' Gross profits rose to Pounds 8.1m (Pounds 5.8m) on turnover of Pounds 27.1m (Pounds 25.7m), while administrative expenses were cut from Pounds 9.1m to Pounds 7.5m. There was an operating profit of Pounds 1.6m, compared with a loss of Pounds 1m, before an Pounds 800,000 gain on the disposal of its Peverel management company. The proceeds from the disposal together with the rights issue cash would have given pro forma net bank debt of Pounds 7.3m at the end of the half year, compared with shareholders' funds of Pounds 81.2m. Losses per share emerged at 0.6p (8.7p). Following the rights issue the company has committed UK banking facilities of about Pounds 41m extended to May 31 1995. It intends to revise the facilities in the near future with a view to obtaining better terms and providing greater facilities. At the end of the period UK stocks comprised 921 (1,199) units of finished stock, 593 (367) units under construction and a land bank of 1,136 (1,418) units. The company added 571 units to its land bank, compared with 121 in the same period last year, at an average price 'significantly' lower than the cost of land that is being charged against costs of sales. 'As we sell from the sites we are currently acquiring the average cost of sales will fall significantly,' Mr McCarthy said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 14 (YONHAP) -- Labor-management wage  negotiations have been settled an average of two weeks earlier  than in 1993 and this year's pay hikes are higher, the Trade,  Industry and Energy Ministry said Saturday.    As of May 11, out of the 5,483 workplaces with 100 or more  employees around the country, wages had been agreed at 1,323  workplaces for a settlement rate of 24.1 percent. On the same  date last year, the ratio stood at 16.7 percent.    Among the workplaces which have settled wage negotiations,  the average salary hike came to 5.9 percent, up 1.4 percentage  point from 4.5 percent last year. Among the 30 major business  groups, 57 of 392 workplaces have settled wage talks for a  settlement rate of 24.1 percent, compared with 12.2 percent last  year.    Labor unions are demanding different wage hikes according to  the category of business. Automobile unions called for a 15-16  percent rise and shipbuilding unions demanded an increase of  12-13 percent, but these figures are 5-6 percentage points below  those of last year.    Meanwhile, labor unions in the Hyundai and Daewoo business  groups plan to withdraw from the Federation of Korean Trade  Unions, and there is a movement toward forming a stronger  federation of labor unions.</p>

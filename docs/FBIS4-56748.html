			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, Commander in Chief Fidel Castro is completing  the second day of his official visit to Barbados on the occasion  of the Global Conference on Small Developing Island States.  Reporter Ruben Pino will give us further details on this.    [Begin Pino recording] The plan of action and the Barbados  Declaration were finally approved today after an extensive  workday of this First Global Conference on Sustainable  Development of Small Island Developing States, during which the  floor was given to the 13 speakers who were unable to speak  during the previous session.    Commander in Chief Fidel Castro, who yesterday afternoon  presided over the final part of that top-level meeting, also  joined the roundtable meeting of chiefs of states and of  governments, who held a meeting behind closed doors as of 1130  this morning.    During the final day of sessions in the (Cherbun) Center,  Commander in Chief Fidel Castro met with Lloyd Erskine  Sandiford, President of the Global Conference and Prime Minister  of Barbados. Sandiford said his country is continuously working  for everything related to the Caribbean and outside the region,  seeking Cuba's full integration into the American system in an  effort to overcome the current differences. The Barbadian prime  minister added that Cuba as a Caribbean nation plays an  important role in the development of the region and of the  hemisphere.    Likewise, the Cuban president said he was impressed by the  independent position the Carribean region adopted throughout its  history concerning Cuba, and expressed interest in tightening  relations within the context and objectives of the Association  of the Caribbean States.    Fidel Castro also stressed the delegates' contribution to  the  debate, adding that Cuba will work for the implementation of all  the decisions adopted by the conference in its plan of action.    Late this afternoon, Fidel Castro also held a meeting with  approximately 100 representatives of nongovernmental  organizations [NGO's] who participated in the Conference of  Small Island Developing States.    During this meeting, (Jian Frenz), coordinator of  nongovernmental organizations from the Caribbean, briefed the  Cuban president about the resolutions adopted by the  participants of that forum in support of the Cuban people's  right to their development, and against the U.S. blockade. In  this exchange of ideas, the commander in chief expressed his  recognition of the growing power of the NGO's and the important  contribution they have made in creating an awareness of the need  to take care of the environment, an awareness he did not  perceive among politicians during the Rio de Janeiro summit.    Fidel Castro also expressed thanks for the solidarity and  support for the Cuban people, and underscored the contribution  of the government representatives during the forum paralleling  the global conference. He added that the influence of good ideas  can be felt everywhere, and also within the NGO's. You are  leaving us a valuable experience and for this reason, the  feelings of dignity, independence, and honor are present in each  of you, and they are part of the great battle you are waging.

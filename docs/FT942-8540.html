			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Pakistan falls short of growth target Pakistan is finishing the current fiscal year, which ends next month, with a growth rate of 4 per cent, compared with a target of 7.5 per cent, a senior government official said yesterday. Worst hit was the agriculture sector which grew only 2.6 per cent because of a virus which affected the cotton crop. Between 50 and 60 per cent of Pakistan's exports consist of items made from cotton. The country produced only 7.5m bales of cotton against a target of 12m bales. Mr VA Jafarey, the prime minister's top adviser on finance acknowledged at a seminar in Islamabad that inflation had been running at 10.5 per cent up against a goal of 8 per cent. Despite the setbacks, he said the government's efforts to improve macroeconomic stability, had been fruitful and he was confident of keeping the deficit within the target of 5.4 per cent of gross domestic product. He added that foreign exchange reserves had risen to Dollars 1.9bn, more than six times the level last summer at the height of a political crisis. He claimed that despite a 3.1 per cent drop in exports, the country's trade balance had improved thanks to a 12.6 per cent fall in imports. 'Our key priority is to attain macroeconomic stability. We consider it a prerequisite for future growth,' he said. Independent economists monitoring the economy ahead of next month's annual budget, give credit to the government for improving fiscal discipline in an effort to reverse years of uncontrolled spending. But budget-makers are under pressure to find more resources for development as almost two-thirds of the budget goes towards debt servicing and defence. Some officials fear that a recent 20 per cent increase in defence expenditure by India, Pakistan's arch enemy, may force Islamabad to spend more on the military.</p>

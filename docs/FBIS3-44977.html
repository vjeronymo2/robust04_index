			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter He Jun: "State Looks Overseas To Boost </F> Universities"]    [Text] The government is considering foreign help to  expand higher education, an official with the State Education  Commission (SEC) said yesterday.    The SEC has already received nine applications to set up  solely foreign-funded institutes or branches of foreign  universities, said the commission's Cao Guoxing.    A rapidly increasing number of foreign schools, enterprises  and individuals is also applying to jointly establish or operate  schools, he said.    Though no exact statistics are available, many  jointly-operated and solely foreign-funded schools have opened  across the country, offering short-term training and vocational  courses.    These foreign partners include overseas Chinese, foreign  schools, and business people, Cao said.    The SEC is working hard to draft regulations to ensure a  smooth and healthy development of co-operation, he said.    No Sino-foreign higher-education projects have been  empowered  to hand out degrees, he added.  <H5>  Power </H5>   Cao stressed that only the SEC has the power to do so while  provincial governments and ministries can authorize lower-level  projects.    Co-operative projects have mushroomed in recent years,  creating disorder, and some were started without proper approval.    Cao urged governments to work out more regulations to  strengthen their control of the projects and guide future  development.    Co-operation helps develop China's educational system as the  projects introduce new management schemes, advanced teaching  methods and more funds, said Cao.    However, he advised a cautious approach, especially in  higher- education, because of education's far-reaching influence  in society.    He stressed that China should have the decisive role in the  projects.    He also said there was a major gap in understanding between  domestic and foreign education systems.    Before any projects are launched, the foreign side should be  well informed of China's educational system, policies and  demands.    And the Chinese should do more research into the partner's  background and educational standards, he added.    None of the projects should be profit-oriented, he said, and  any extra cash should be used only to improve education  facilities and teachers' living standards.    Cao said the SEC would allow no foreign party to get  involved  in running Chinese primary and high schools, but it would  welcome donations from foreign organizations and individuals to  support their development.    The SEC encouraged local authorities to establish more  "international schools" specially for the children of foreign  diplomats and business people working in joint ventures, so as  to fulfill increasing demand.    Such schools are now available in cities like Beijing,  Shanghai and Guangzhou, he added.    The SEC is also encouraging Chinese universities to  establish  branches in foreign countries, said Cao.    It has given the green light to three Chinese universities  to  set up cooperative projects abroad in both undergraduate and  graduate education.</p>

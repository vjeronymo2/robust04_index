			<p>BFN     [Text] The Palestinians today decided to increase their  political activity in East Jerusalem as the peace process  advances. This is their reaction to Israel's expected moves.  Faysal al-Husayni, who holds the Jerusalem portfolio in the  Palestinian Authority, declared that the battle over Jerusalem  has started. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports:    [Begin recording] [Amir] Faysal al-Husayni, the Palestinian  Authority minister in charge of Jerusalem, held a news  conference at Orient House a short time ago and declared that  the battle over Jerusalem has started. He emphasized that in  his opinion Israel started this battle in an attempt to limit  Palestinian political activity in Orient House and other  Palestinian institutions in the city:    [Al-Husayni, in English] We can say that while we are  fighting a battle to end the isolation of Jerusalem from the  other part of the occupied territories, I believe the Israelis  are trying to open a new fight and a new battle against us, so  they hope that the world and we will forget about the matter of  the closure of Jerusalem and we will fight only for our  existence and the existence of our institutions in Jerusalem.    [Amir, translates the above and continues] Al-Husayni said  that while the Palestinians are trying to struggle against the  isolation of Jerusalem from other areas in the territories --  referring to the ongoing closure on the city -- Israel is trying  to open a new battle against us in order to make the world and  us forget the closure on Jerusalem and limit our struggle to the  existence of our institutions in Jerusalem.    Al-Husayni noted that the political activity in East  Jerusalem preceded the Oslo agreement, and that it drew its  strength from the peace process rather than the interim  agreement. He emphasized, therefore, that the Palestinians will  open more political institutions in East Jerusalem as the peace  process advances, because it was agreed that the negotiations  over Jerusalem would start only during the last stage of the  agreement.

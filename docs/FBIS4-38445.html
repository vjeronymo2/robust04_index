			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Albert Kochetkov] </F>   [Text] Tbilisi, 28 May -- Eduard Shevardnadze had  discussions in Tbilisi today with Lieutenant General Aleksandr  Sokolov, deputy commander in chief of the emergency land forces  of the Russian Defence Ministry, about the mechanism for  introducing and deploying peacekeeping forces in the  Georgian-Abkhaz conflict zone.    Gen. Sokolov visited Abkhazia earlier on the same mission  and  is reported to have spent the day before the meeting  reconnoitering at the Inguri River, the place proposed for the  deployment of the peacekeeping contingent to disengage the  warring sides. According to unconfirmed information, about  3,000 servicemen can be ready to carry out this task within a  few hours.    In accordance with the Georgian-Abkhaz agreements previously  reached under the aegis of the United Nations and with Russian  mediation, the peacekeeping forces are also to ensure the  security of the refugees returning to their previous places of  residence. Various sources put their number at 250-300,000.    Offical sources in Tbilisi are not reporting any details  about the meeting between Eduard Shevardnadze and are not  commenting on it. However, to judge from the way events are  developing, the peacekeeping troops may be introduced into the  Georgian-Abkhaz conflict zone in the very near future.</p>

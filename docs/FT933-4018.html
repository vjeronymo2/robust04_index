			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Cost cuts help Blue Circle grow COST-CUTTING helped Blue Circle Industries, Britain's biggest cement manufacturer, achieve a 31 per cent increase in first-half profits before exceptional items. The building materials and home products group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 60.5m for the six months to June 30, compared with profits before exceptional items of Pounds 46.3m. In the 1992 first half, exceptional gains of Pounds 40.1m, mainly from disposals, lifted pre-tax profits, restated under FRS 3 accounting rules, to Pounds 86.4m. Earnings in the latest period came to 5p, against 4.1p in 1992 before exceptionals and 10.2p including the exceptional profits. The share price added 14p to 284p. Operating profits before net interest payments of Pounds 17.4m (Pounds 12.6m) increased by almost a third to Pounds 77.9m (Pounds 58.9m). Turnover grew to Pounds 798.8m (Pounds 570.4m). Mr Keith Orrell-Jones, group managing director, said he was 'pleased but by no means satisfied' with the improved operating results. He added: 'Market conditions are now showing some signs of improvement, in both the UK and the US.' The heavy building materials division, comprising the cement, concretes and aggregates businesses, raised profits to Pounds 53m (Pounds 42.8m), on sales of Pounds 353.5m (Pounds 296.4m). Operating profits at Blue Circle Cement (BCC) in the UK fell to Pounds 12.7m, compared with Pounds 15.9m before exceptional costs of Pounds 3.6m in the year-ago period. BCC's sales volume slipped by 5 per cent to 2.9m tonnes, reflecting weaker construction output and cement demand. However, Mr James Loudon, finance director, said the price increases introduced in June had largely recovered the erosion over the previous year. He also noted that the rationalisation programme announced in June, involving capacity cuts and a 20 per cent reduction in the workforce, had been completed and savings would be reflected in second-half results. Blue Circle America, which is focused on the south-eastern US, boosted operating profits to Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 1.9m). In the home products division, profits grew by a modest 5 per cent to Pounds 24.2m (Pounds 23.1m) despite a near doubling in turnover to Pounds 396m (199.8m) partly reflecting the acquisition last year of Celsius, the French and German central heating businesses. Net debt at June 30 stood at Pounds 385m, down from Pounds 405m at the end of December and represented gearing of 38 per cent. COMMENT The cynic might argue that Blue Circle is merely reaping the rewards of its substantial provisions in previous years. Nevertheless, the restructuring of the BCC operations has substantially reduced costs just as the cycle appears to be turning. In contrast, the lacklustre performance of the continental heating businesses again highlights the unfortunate timing of the Celsius purchase and accompanying rights issue. However, pre-tax profits should rise to about Pounds 155m this year, producing earnings of about 13.6p and a prospective p/e of about 21. This is a classic recovery stock.</p>

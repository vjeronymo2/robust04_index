			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marisol Marin] </F>   [Text] Havana, 2 Jun (EFE) -- Although three more people  left the Belgian Embassy in Havana last night, Cuban authorities  are "very concerned" about the threat of suicide that was in a  message sent by the 124 refugees to the press on Tuesday.    Today, official sources expressed their concern to EFE, both  for the "threat to commit suicide" and the fact that the  refugees have formed an organization within the embassy grounds,  on which they trespassed last Saturday to request asylum.    In the message, the refugees announced their decision to  create an organization called "Union of Cubans for Freedom;"  they refused to hold talks with the government "for lack of  guarantees" and said they were ready for anything, "even losing  their lives."    A high-ranking Cuban Foreign Ministry official, who asked  not  to be identified, stressed that the Cuban Government "has always  honored its word and there is proof of that," in reference to  the promise made to Belgian authorities that the refugees will  not be punished after leaving the building.    The official reiterated that the two countries agree these  people must leave the building peacefully. The official also  reported that Willy Verriest, special Belgian Government envoy  who arrived on Tuesday, is cooperating so the refugees leave the  embassy as soon as possible."    "They have asked for time to convince the refugees and we  will never violate Belgian territory," explained the source, who  also complained about "the little cooperation received from the  head of mission (Paul Veirmeirsch)."    Diplomatic sources in Havana remarked that Verriest's  arrival  should expedite the solution to the problem, given that  Ambassador Veirmeirsch seems to have had some communication  difficulty with Cuban authorities.    In short statements to the press, Verriest said the only  thing that can be done is to convince the refugees to accept the  guarantees given by the Cuban Government, "but this is not  easy," he added. Verriest said: "We want a peaceful solution;  the Cuban Government also wants a peaceful solution. None of us  wants violence."    Up until now, four people have left the diplomatic  headquarters; one on Sunday and three yesterday. Their  identities are unknown but, according to observers, they may be  the last who, unexplainably, managed to enter the compound early  Saturday morning by avoiding dozens of police. In a message  sent to the press, the refugees said they suspected those four  individuals were government security members.    Meanwhile, the ambassadors of the European Union in Cuba  have  met three times in three consecutive days -- the last time was  on yesterday, Wednesday -- but none of them has wanted to  comment to the press.    The wives of several ambassadors are actively cooperating in  supplying food to the refugees and they regularly send snacks  and other foodstuff, at the request of the Belgian ambassador.    From the top of a ladder placed against a tree, a television  channel was able to film a sort of a rustic scene in the gardens  of the ambassador's residence yesterday afternoon. The children  ran and played and the mothers, who were sitting down, were  spending the afternoon peacefully. When he noticed the camera,  a man said hello and then, with his hands, made the sign of  victory.</p>

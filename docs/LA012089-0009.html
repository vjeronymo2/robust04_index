			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> POLICE CLUB PROTESTERS AS CZECH UNREST PERSISTS  </P> <P> Riot police beat protesters with clubs Thursday and formed human cordons to  drive 2,000 people from Wenceslas Square, where activists demanding more human  rights have rallied five straight days.  </P> <P> More than a dozen protesters were beaten badly and at least 10 were dragged  away by police during a melee that broke out after authorities shouted through  loudspeakers that the rally was unauthorized.  </P> <P> It was the most violent clash between protesters and police since the  gatherings began Sunday.  </P> <P> The crowd had been chanting slogans demanding broader freedoms in the  Communist-ruled nation, but those slogans changed to "Gestapo! Gestapo!" when  the baton-wielding wave of riot police swept through, lashing out  indiscriminately.  </P> <P> Officers linked arms to form human chains and push the protesters out of the  square.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mayor's Television Appeal  </P> <P> Mayor Vdenek Horcik appealed for the "provocations" to stop. Speaking on  national television, Horcik urged parents and teachers to keep young people off  the streets and said the police action was necessary to maintain order.  </P> <P> The crowd assembled shortly after 5 p.m., when many Prague residents were on  their way home after work. They shouted "Free Havel!" and "Let them go!"  referring to human rights activist Vaclav Havel and 14 others jailed for taking  part in earlier protests.  </P> <P> Hundreds of officers poured into the half-mile-long square from side streets  when the protesters refused to leave, charging the crowd and pushing them along  the boulevard.  </P> <P> Police vans and ambulances with sirens blaring arrived to help force away the  demonstrators. Water cannon were brought onto the square but not used.  </P> <P> The demonstrations began Sunday when about 5,000 people gathered at Wenceslas  Square for a memorial to Jan Palach, who burned himself to death 20 years ago  to protest the presence of Soviet troops after the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gorbachev's Name Invoked  </P> <P> Troops and tanks sent in by the Kremlin in August, 1968, crushed the Prague  Spring reforms, which now are likened to the social and economic changes  championed by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> Some protesters yelled "Gorbachev sees this!" when police moved in Thursday.  </P> <P> In another development, former Foreign Minister Jiri Hajek, a member of the  Charter 77 human rights group, was denied permission to visit West Germany for  the 75th birthday of his friend, former Chancellor Willy Brandt.  </P> <P> Hajek, who was allowed to visit Austria last month, said Prague authorities  deemed it against state interests for him to travel abroad.  </P></p>

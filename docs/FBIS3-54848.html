Orientation in just  one direction is not advantageous for our country and will not  yield the desired results." Lithuanian Head of State Algirdas  Brazauskas stated this in his customary Monday interview on  national radio.    "In my view, a very important and one of the main priorities  in Lithuania's foreign policy activity is close cooperation and  unity with the Baltic states," he noted.    "I do not see the sense in and reasons for revising  relations  between Lithuania and Russia which, I am convinced, should not  deteriorate in the coming year. We hope that Russian President  Boris Yeltsin and the democratic forces which are forming or  have already formed in the new parliament will correctly  understand this tendency in the Baltic countries to have a  benevolent attitude toward the Russian Federation as a neighbor  country, and will be agreeable to maintaining normal relations,"  the head of the Lithuanian state stressed.</p>

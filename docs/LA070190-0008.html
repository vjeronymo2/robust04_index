			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW FICTION;  </P> <P> TALES FOR A SUMMER DAY  </P> <P> It's time to celebrate Independence Day and, not coincidentally, the second Los  Angeles Times Magazine fiction issue. We have collected five new stories from  western writers that will transport you on horseback to Culver City, put you  through grad school at Stanford, admit you to a magic show on the Kern River,  effect your escape from Seguin, Tex., or teach you the scientific name of the  housefly. So light the sparklers, slice the watermelon and put on your reading  sunglasses. Happy Fourth!  </P> <P> MAX SCHOTT  </P> <P> "Writing," Max Schott says, "is a way of thinking about my own past." In fact,  the characters and events in "Shannon" (Page 18) are autobiographical: There  was a stable owner who was like a second father to Schott when he was growing  up in Culver City; there was a girl who died trick riding and another who  fibbed her way into the stable where he worked. "The story was inspired by  memories, but I was also fascinated by ideas of independence in rodeo girls.  They simply wouldn't be imposed on by anyone. They fascinated me as a kind of  ideal."  </P> <P> Much of the cast of "Shannon" is also the cast of Schott's latest novel, "Ben,"  published last month by North Point Press. Schott, a horse trainer and rodeo  roper till he was 30, is 55 and a professor of writing and literature at UC  Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> SANDRA CISNEROS  </P> <P> Sandra Cisneros, 35, a Chicago-born Texan, calls herself a "migrant professor."  She has taught for the past few years on three California campuses -- most  recently at UC Irvine. Her story, "Woman Hollering Creek" (Page 14), is all  about reality: "The soap operas are real," she says, "the people are real; the  character Cleofilas is based on a woman I encountered, helped escape from an  abusive husband. And a creek by the name Woman Hollering really does exist in  Texas. When I passed over it, I gave a hoot."  </P> <P> Cisneros' collection of short stories, "The House on Mango Street," won the  Before Columbus Book Award in 1985; "Woman Hollering Creek" will appear in a  new collection due from Random House in the spring.  </P> <P> ETHAN CANIN  </P> <P> "No matter what writers say, most stories are about ourselves," says Ethan  Canin. "The facts might change a little, but not much." Canin, 29, lives in San  Francisco, but he grew up in Pennsylvania and small-town Ohio, a self-confessed  "sort of semi-nerd." He majored in English at Stanford and left Harvard Medical  School one month away from obtaining an MD.  </P> <P> His story, "The Scientific Method" (Page 10), is excerpted from a  novel-in-progress that will be published next year by Houghton Mifflin. It  expands on the story "American Beauty," which appeared in Canin's best-selling  collection, "Emperor of the Air," in 1988. This fall, Canin will teach writing  at the University of Michigan.  </P> <P> ALICE ADAMS  </P> <P> "The Easterners" (Page 24) is just a few months out of Alice Adams' typewriter.  Since 1966, she has published six novels ("Superior Women," in 1985, was a  bestseller), four short-story collections and many individual pieces. She began  by writing "awfully bad" poetry but gave it up in college. It wasn't until she  was 40 that her first novel was published.  </P> <P> "The Easterners," Adams says, contains a theme that especially interests her:  "the myth of the evil Easterner and the good Westerner."  </P> <P> Adams lives in San Francisco; her latest novel, "The Last Lovely City," will be  released next spring by Knopf.  </P> <P> GERALD HASLAM  </P> <P> "Quintessentially Californian" is the way Gerald Haslam's dozens of Central  Valley essays and short stories are usually described. "Writing about rural  California," Haslam says, "has been to my advantage. Outsiders think we all  roller skate to hot tubs, but we also work in the oil fields. I get a lot of  creative energy from that tension."  </P> <P> Haslam, 53, teaches English at Sonoma State University. "Upstream" (Page 30) is  taken from "That Constant Coyote," published last month by the University of  Nevada Press.  </P> <P> "What does 'Upstream' mean? I honestly don't know," he says. "It's a tall tale,  about primordial escape, I guess. Who knows where such a story comes from?"  </P></p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Strength in unity is only UK option Sir, Norman Lamont's thoughts concerning the UK and the European Union place him some time in the first decade of this century ('Lamont says it may be necessary to pull out of EU', October 12). He need only look beyond his small island to see that the UK will wither and shrivel if it cuts itself off from the continent. The economic power centres of the world are shifting to the east. China's enormous potential is only beginning to be realised. Among the great advantages China has over western Europe is that it has so much to do in order to modernise. Not having progressed at the rate of the west, China can make use of the latest technologies without having to consider a loss on its investment in earlier technology. China will indeed make its 'great leap forward'. Without strong competition from a united Europe and a reinvigorated North America, China will be far ahead by the middle of the new century. In the face of the progress of China and some of the other countries in East Asia, the UK is not in a position to go it alone. Like the rest of Europe (of which, like it or not, it is a part), the UK will have to find strength in union. The only other alternative I can see is for the UK to halt all further development and to turn the whole country into a museum. In 20 years or so the nation and its people could make a decent living by charging admission. How quaint it would be. J H de Raat, Kantershof 54, 1104 GC Amsterdam, The Netherlands</p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Risen from the electronic ether: Philips has still to show that it can make it in the multimedia big league Philips, the Dutch electronics group, has clearly survived the traumas of the early 1990s, when heavy losses and hefty debts nearly caused its collapse. Having pulled through the crisis, Philips must now show that it can marshal its resources and develop a product range with which to compete in the multimedia age. Last week, the company managed to close two painful episodes. First, on Wednesday, it announced plans to spend Fl 500m (Dollars 275m) to boost capacity at its semiconductor plant in the Dutch town of Nijmegen. The move is significant. Not only is it the biggest single investment in new plant since the dark days of the early 1990s; the equipment will also fill a symbolic 'hole' in the Nijmegen factory caused by the painful decision in 1990 to pull back from commercial production of static random-access memory (S-Ram) chips. Philips had hoped to break into the market for these advanced chips - a market dominated by Japanese manufacturers. The surprise cancellation of the S-Ram project was the first wrenching step taken by Mr Jan Timmer when he became Philips' president. Under his crusade to shake up corporate culture, Operation Centurion, he forced the company to emphasise profits and productivity over job security and scientific prestige. His scrapping of the project left part of the Nijmegen plant empty, and this is the space that will be filled by equipment to produce Philips' new generation of submicron integrated circuits. These are the miniaturised, energy-efficient 'brains' of cellular telephones and other portable electronics products. Second, on Thursday last week, Philips announced a 244 per cent increase in second-quarter profits, the biggest gain so far in the 1990s. What confirmed Philips' rehabilitation was not so much the rise itself, though this exceeded forecasts, but the fact that nobody seemed particularly worried ahead of the results or relieved afterwards. There was none of the hand-wringing and doom-saying that accompanied other quarterly reports in the Netherlands in recent years. Philips, in short, has become a 'normal' company again, treated little differently from other blue-chip Dutch groups that have reported results over the past two weeks: its survival is no longer in doubt. Mr Dudley Eustace, Philips' finance director since 1992, confirms the company is ready to move from cost-cutting to 'revitalisation'. But does Philips, just back in good financial health with a balance sheet that is finally lightened of debt, have deep enough pockets to compete in the expensive world of multimedia deals? The company clearly has the resources to invest and the ability to borrow, having secured a Dollars 2.5bn stand-by credit facility in June from a consortium of international banks led by CS First Boston. But observers do not expect it to embark on big acquisitions or lavish investment spending. The Fl 500m to pay for the new section of the Nijmegen plant will come out of the semiconductor division's own cash flow. The investment is one that the division has earned: 'They cut back early, and they've become fit and ready,' says Mr Eustace. Earlier this year, Mr Eustace said Philips might consider a share issue if the right acquisition arose in the field of 'software'. In the new jargon of multimedia that term now encompasses the music, films and information systems that run on the industry's 'hardware', such as video recorders and interactive compact disc players. But Philips does not intend to go on a spending spree. 'We have so recently come down from a very highly indebted level that I have no desire to leave the impression with the investment community at large that all of a sudden we've forgotten our past,' Mr Eustace says. The company's statements bring to mind its strategy in the early 1990s when PolyGram, its majority-owned entertainment company, decided to move into films by acquiring small production companies, one of which produced the hit film Four Weddings and a Funeral. This low-key, low-cost approach contrasted sharply with the billion-dollar acquisitions of big Hollywood studios by Philips' richer Japanese rivals. Sony acquired Columbia Pictures and Matsushita bought MCA, owner of Universal Pictures. Mr Eustace acknowledges a similarity between Philips' careful involvement in film and its overall investment plans. 'I think we're still a pretty cautious Dutch company, and we're not likely suddenly to go and enter the race to buy CBS or something like that,' he says. 'Prudence will dictate that we take bite-sized moves into this area, rather than trying to swallow a giant. That would be very foolish.' Still, Philips is gearing up for higher investments at a time when it has yet to recoup the money it has put into its three latest consumer-electronics products - high-definition television (HDTV), compact disc-interactive (CD-I) and digital compact cassette (DCC). HDTV's birth has been hampered by competing ideas on standards in Europe, Japan and the US, and it has yet to be launched on the mass market. By contrast, CD-I and DCC have both been brought fully to market, and there is no disguising that sales of players for DCC - Philips' successor to the analogue audio cassette - have been disappointing. The company is now narrowing down its initial European marketing focus to the UK and parts of the Continent, but it is clear that DCC has not yet emerged as a 'must-have' product. CD-I sales have been more encouraging, but Philips has not succeeded in making the interactive CD player - capable of teaching people to play musical instruments or to access a 'living' encyclopedia from the television sets in their living rooms - the industry-wide vehicle for multimedia entertainment and education. Philips protests that its three latest consumer-electronics products always come under media scrutiny, to the exclusion of other innovations, ranging from medical scanners to car headlights. It adds that all three predated the Centurion shake-up and were launched, almost simultaneously, in the middle of a recession. This will not, however, be a credible excuse for any market failure by the products of any new investment programmes. How these products fare will be an important test not only of the company's new-found financial health but of its ability to shake off its sluggish, paternalistic past and to create a growth-orientated, entrepreneurial organisation. Philips acknowledged early on under Mr Timmer that it needed to tap outside expertise. Indeed, one of the visible signs of the changes at Philips is the number of Americans, Britons and Scandinavians now in charge of product divisions. Of the 13 members of the group management committee, the company's main operational forum, just five are Dutchmen, a reversal of the situation before 1990 when Dutch executives, usually life-long Philips veterans, filled the top rank. In keeping with the new pattern, Philips Media, the New York-based outpost of the group's multimedia ambitions, is now run by Mr Scott Marden, a US investment banker with experience of the publishing, cable and communications industries. At the very highest level, Mr Frank Carrubba was brought on to the five-member Philips management board from Hewlett-Packard to look after technology. The fact that Mr Eustace, an Englishman and former finance director of British Aerospace, sits down in Eindhoven every quarter to present the company's results - in English - is an indication of just how far Philips has come from its days as the most insular of Dutch multinationals. This imported talent, which includes a number of Dutch newcomers, now fills many of the crucial positions in the company and exercises considerable influence over a venerable member of the corporate establishment. In the end Philips' capacity for innovation, likely to be generated by this talent, as well as the quality of its product range will be as important in determining its future as the breadth of its financial resources.</p>

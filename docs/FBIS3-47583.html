The officials said the appeal was contained in a report  submitted to Labor Minister Chikara Sakaguchi by the Central  Employment Security Council.    The report called for widening the scope of job categories  from the current 16, including secretaries and interpreters,  that such agencies are allowed to handle.    The report also called on the government to provide  subsidies  to corporations which improve working conditions for senior  workers.    The recommendations include a call for the establishment of  a  center to help workers over 60 find jobs, the officials said.    They said the ministry plans to submit to the next ordinary  session of the Diet a bill to revise a job security law to  incorporate the proposed measures and make it mandatory for  corporations to set the retirement age at 60 in principle.</p>

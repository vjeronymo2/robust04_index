			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- The government paid out  2,163.0 billion yen more than it received against the private  sector in fiscal 1993, up 9,321.3 billion yen from year-earlier  net receipts of 7,158.3 billion yen, the Finance Ministry said  Friday [1 April]. The large net payments reflected a series of  pump-priming measures, sluggish tax revenues and increased net  payments in foreign exchange funds, a ministry official told  reporters.    As for the latest reporting month of March, the national  coffer posted net payments of 2,874.9 billion yen, down 687.3  billion yen from the same month a year earlier.    In the fiscal year that ended just Thursday, tax revenues  came to 55,032.1 billion yen, down 2,978.5 billion yen from a  year earlier, stemming from the weak economy, the official said.    Covering the sluggish tax income, bond issuance rose 4,862.5  billion yen to lift overall revenues by 1,917.8 billion yen to  66,966.8 billion yen.    Net payments resulted as general-account expenditures rose  2,569.7 billion yen to 45,969.8 billion yen, the special account  increased 3,612.6 billion yen in net payments to 18,995.0  billion yen, and foreign exchange funds marked net payments of  3,836.2 billion yen, up 5,142.6 billion yen from the previous  year's net receipts of 1,306.4 billion yen.    Reflecting the economic stimulus packages in particular,  spending on public works climbed 1,933.6 billion yen to 6,075.6  billion yen, a special account for the ministry's trust fund  bureau decreased 1,115.0 billion yen in net payments to 5,588.7  billion yen, and government-backed financial institutions posted  net payments of 4,915.0 billion yen, up 3,220.6 billion yen.    The net payments in foreign exchange funds apparently  stemmed  from dollar-buying intervention by the Bank of Japan to stop the  yen's sharp rise, and the ministry official said the figure is  the largest since 1986 when net payments came to 4,350.6 billion  dollars.    The official said March public works spending and  disbursement from the Trust Fund Bureau and public financial  institutions remained steady for the month, in line with the  third supplementary budget enacted in February to fund large  chunks of the latest 15 trillion yen stimulus package. He cited  the small year-on-year decline in overall net payments despite a  full 2,073.5 billion yen increase in bond issuance.    For the month of April, the ministry projected 4,134.0  billion yen in net payments, down 2,507.5 billion yen from  year-earlier net payments of 6,641.5 billion yen.</p>

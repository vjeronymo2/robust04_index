			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Thyssen to slash steel production THYSSEN Stahl, Germany's biggest steel maker, is to slash production by almost a quarter and introduce short-time working in the last three months of this year. In an announcement which coincided with renewed warnings that the industry could soon face an international structural crisis, the company said output from its two hot-rolling mills would be 300,000 tonnes less than in the last quarter of 1991. The cuts, intended to help stabilise prices, would affect practically all other manufacturing stages, it added. No details were available of numbers affected by the introduction of short time. Blaming falling orders and increasing price competition inside the European Community - 'the last large open market' - Thyssen said the rise in imports from eastern Europe had been especially strong. According to the RWI economics institute in Essen, a leading centre of expertise on the industry, manufacturers in former communist states are now selling steel at 'almost any price' inside the Community because their domestic markets have collapsed. East European steel imports into Germany are expected to reach 2.3m tonnes this year, compared with 900,000 tonnes in 1991. The German industry, which recently warned of the need for up to 20,000 job losses by the end of 1994, has been squeezed progressively throughout this year by falling prices and shrinking domestic and international demand. Foreign markets have failed to recover in line with forecasts, and key domestic customers in the plant engineering and vehicle industries have reported steep falls in new orders. Steel price increases imposed in the spring have since been eroded, and total production has fallen. According to government figures, German steel output fell 2.2 per cent in the first nine months of this year. The RWI institute said although available data suggested that steel makers were currently being hit by a 'normal' cyclical downturn, the flood of cheap imports combined with the threatened closure of the US market to imports could cause long-term damage. If European exporters were refused access to North America as a result of domestic suppliers' complaints of dumping, and the imports continued, the result could be structural over-capacity in Europe. This could lead to a situation last experienced in the late 1970s, when European manufacturers demanded state subsidies to gain or protect market share, the institute said. There were already signs that this was happening. 'In Spain, Italy and France, open or hidden subsidies are being paid with little or no requirement for capacity reductions,' the institute claimed.</p>

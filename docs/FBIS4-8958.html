			<p>BFN     [Text] Skopje, April 19 (TANJUG) -- While Skopje is  awaiting the arrival of a further contingent of 180 U.S. troops  serving on the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (F.Y.R.O.M.), the new Macedonian  Communist movement is collecting signatures for its petition  demanding that they should leave.    All foreign troops serving under the U.N. flag should leave  the F.Y.R.O.M., as their presence is at odds with some  provisions of the state's constitution, says the party's  president Trifun Andreevski.    Andreevski quotes Articles 122 and 123 of the constitution  which state that the sovereignty and independence of Macedonia  shall be defended by the Macedonian Army.    If this demand is not granted, then the party, based in the  western town of Gostivar, demands that at least the U.S. troops  be replaced by those from Russia, D.P.R. Korea, China or Japan.    The (?incoming) contingent should bring the (?number of)  U.S.  troops [words indistinct] up to 500.    Nearly 1,000 UNPROFOR troops, mostly from Scandinavian  countries, have been deployed in the F.Y.R.O.M. since early 1993.    A string of ranking U.S. Army and NATO officials have  recently been visiting the F.Y.R.O.M., among them U.S. Joint  Chief of Staff General John Shalikashvili in early April.

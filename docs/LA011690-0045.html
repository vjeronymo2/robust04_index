			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> NCR Corp.: The Dayton, Ohio-based firm said its fiscal 1989 earnings fell 6% to  $412 million as its revenue slipped 1% to $5.96 billion. The maker of business  information processing systems said worldwide revenue recorded a gain when the  impact of the stronger U.S. dollar in year-to-year comparisons is excluded.  Higher investment in research and development, declines in revenue and gross  margins, and a share-repurchase program contributed to the decrease in net  income, the company said.  </P></p>

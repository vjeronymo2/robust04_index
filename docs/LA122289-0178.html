Mill, S.C., girl waiting for a heart transplant was given  permission to go home for Christmas, but not before she got a stellar sendoff  from actor Tom Cruise.  </P> <P> "When he came in the room, her heart monitor showed her heart rate went up to  170 beats a minute," Ginger Mason said. "She was absolutely so excited she  couldn't stand it."  </P> <P> Cruise, who was filming Paramount Pictures' "Days of Thunder" at Charlotte  Motor Speedway, brought Brandi Mason a hat and shirt, autographed her  pillowcase and then visited some of the other children at Charlotte Memorial  Hospital on Thursday.  </P> <P> Doctors said they don't know when a heart will be available for Brandi, who was  found to have myocarditis, a rare viral infection of the heart, in July.  </P></p>

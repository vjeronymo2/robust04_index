			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Vickers set to win order for 250 tanks - Defence The government is poised to place an order thought to be worth about Pounds 800m for up to 250 Vickers Challenger 2 battle tanks for the army. The decision is expected to be announced shortly in a bid to offset the impact of further defence cuts in the budget. Following an order for 127 Challenger 2s in 1991, the additional purchase would secure work at Vickers' twin-tank production lines at Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne until after the turn of the century. Each plant employs about 800. Military planners have argued that Pounds 800m would be enough to buy sufficient tanks to equip all eight tank regiments in Britain's slimmed-down army. Vickers has been anxiously awaiting the order following setbacks to export hopes for the Challenger 2 in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. Its sole export customer so far is Oman, which has ordered 18 with an option for 18 more. But Vickers wants to compete for an expected 230-tank Saudi order. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, may provide an indication of the UK government's intention today. The government may also give Westland, the helicopter manufacturer, a commitment to buy EH101 helicopters for the RAF. Sharper cuts, Page 27</p>

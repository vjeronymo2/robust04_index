			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Judge refuses to drop fraud charges against Clifford A NEW YORK state judge yesterday refused to dismiss a fraud and bribery indictment against Mr Clark Clifford, the 86-year-old former US defence secretary, in connection with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) scandal. Mr Clifford's lawyers had made the request because of his heart condition. But Judge John Bradley said the medical testimony was 'conflicting' and the trial of Mr Clifford, and of Mr Robert Altman, his law partner, should go ahead on February 15. The judge concluded that Mr Clifford was 'trying to manipulate the criminal justice system to his own advantage,' but left open the possibility of delaying his trial by separating it from Mr Altman's. Mr Clifford and Mr Altman resigned in August 1991 as chairman and president of First American Bankshares, a leading Washington bank, and were charged in New York last July with fraud, bribery and allegedly concealing from US banking regulators their knowledge of BCCI's secret control of First American. Judge Bradley dismissed broader conspiracy charges against Mr Clifford, on the grounds that the legal time limit had expired. Referring to the remaining criminal charges, the judge said that after reading 9,500 pages of the underlying Grand Jury minutes he had the impression 'that the evidence of guilt is overwhelming'. The judge said Mr Clifford had an obligation to appear on Thursday in New York for a pre-trial hearing, but could waive his right to appear on health grounds. Mr Clifford's lawyers have been trying for months either to delay the trial or have the case dismissed. But aides to Mr Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney who has spearheaded BCCI prosecutions in the US, have argued that Mr Clifford should stand trial. Both he and Mr Altman also face a separate indictment in Washington on charges of allegedly lying to federal banking regulators about their knowledge of BCCI's secret ownership of First American.</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Haggling over the price of peace: The significance of tomorrow's US-Syria summit Syria's state media could hardly have raised expectations much higher for tomorrow's summit in Switzerland between President Bill Clinton and President Hafez al-Assad. It is, trumpeted The Syria Times, 'one of the most important meetings of Geneva's history, and perhaps the history of the Middle East'. In the melee of Damascus's ancient Hamadiya souq, or market, the view is more circumspect, however. Traders in its grid of alleys have found buyers for its silver and silk over centuries among Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, Romans and Turks. They are not persuaded that tomorrow heralds the immediate prospect of bus loads of Israeli shoppers. 'The meeting will help the atmosphere,' says Samad, a young shop owner. 'Peace is important to us, of course, but difficult. We need time.' The true significance of tomorrow's meeting, for Syria, lies somewhere between the media hype and the caution of the souq. For Mr Assad, a cautious and wily strategist whose main preoccupation has long been maintaining his iron grip on Syria, it lies in the symbolism of the event itself - and that is the main reason for the media fanfare. A summit with the leader of the world's sole superpower confirms for Mr Assad his centrality to the Middle East peace process and his regional leadership. As one state newspaper said: 'A giant will meet with a giant.' It is only Mr Assad's fourth meeting with a US president in 23 years of rule, the last being with Mr George Bush in Geneva in 1990. Then, Syria sealed its participation in the anti-Iraq Gulf war coalition and the two leaders exchanged the initial promises which made the present Middle East peace process possible. Mr Assad will want to hear Mr Clinton repeat those promises which brought him to the negotiating table in 1991: that the US is committed to a 'just and comprehensive' regional peace, which for Syria entails a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, occupied since 1967; and that the US will guarantee any bilateral agreement with the Jewish state. Just as important for Mr Assad - and many in Damascus maintain it is more vital - is his hope that the summit can deliver a substantial improvement in Syrian-US relations. 'He wants more than the Golan back; he wants a new relationship with the US,' says one observer, 'and he wants this as badly as anything.' Here lie Syria's real expectations of the summit. According to many diplomats, the real 'breakthrough' on the peace front arguably took place in Damascus last December when Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, was able to announce Syria's willingness to resume full peace talks with Israel in Washington. Mr Assad had previously insisted there could be no such resumption without an explicit Israeli commitment to a full withdrawal from the Golan. But Mr Christopher's shuttle between Jerusalem and Damascus, and private undertakings to Mr Assad, are believed to have persuaded the Syrian leader that such a deal was feasible in principle. 'Mr Assad's decision to return to the talks shows he has made the strategic decision to make peace,' says a European diplomat in Damascus. Details of such a deal - a 'full' Israeli withdrawal in return for a 'full' peace between Syria and the Jewish state - remain to be worked out. This would be the meat of talks in Washington, which could resume within weeks of a successful summit. At such talks, Mr Assad would place a high premium on direct US engagement, since Syria believes that only US pressure and involvement can exact the right terms for peace from Israel and hold the Israelis to them. Mr Assad has always profoundly distrusted Israel's desire to divide its Arab neighbours and negotiate deals with them one by one. It is a distrust Syrian officials say was vindicated by the secret deal in Oslo between Israel and the Palestinians, which they consider deeply flawed. But Mr Assad also wants a 'full' peace with Washington, which since 1976 has maintained Syria on its list of state sponsors of terrorism. In addition to Syrian membership of the anti-Iraq Gulf war alliance, Damascus's help in freeing western hostages from Lebanon was part of a shift towards the west. Increasingly, according to western diplomats, the Syrian president has come to appreciate the security of his regime and his country's prosperity depend on rapprochement with the west, notably the US. The reasons are manifold. They include the loss of the Soviet Union as his chief strategic ally and the failure of the communist model, whose political, military and economic centralisation Syria has long imitated. But economic pressures have also grown. Although Syria has enjoyed a burst of post-Gulf war prosperity, this is founded on a one-off bonanza from limited oil discoveries, cash rewards from the Gulf states for Syria's participation in the campaign against Iraq and some good recent harvests. Its economic problems are set to worsen. Syrian unemployment stands at 20 per cent and is rising; there are serious infrastructural inadequacies, particularly in power generation; and it has an unmanageable 3.8 per cent birth rate, one of the highest in the developing world. On Syria's present, isolated course, as one western diplomat puts it, 'Assad knows he will be faced with a half-educated population, no jobs, no prospects for the middle class and, perhaps, people starting to say 'Islam is the solution'.' The Syrian leader has clearly concluded that none of these problems can be properly tackled unless his country can win access to western capital and aid, and he sees warmer ties with the US as critical to this process. But Syrian links with terrorist leaders such as Ahmed Jibril and Abu Nidal, and its backing for Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian Lebanese faction - the reason it was included on the US's list of terrorist states in 1976 - remain big obstacles to an improvement in relations. While it stays on that list, Syria is ineligible for US credits or aid and is prohibited from importing US products, including computers, aircraft, aircraft spares and related technology. Perhaps as important as any restriction, however, is the symbolism of pariah status entailed by inclusion on the list. US officials have made it plain Syria will not be lifted from the list tommorrow, or at all, while it supports Hezbollah and harbours men such as Jibril and other Palestinian 'rejectionists'. Yet nobody in Damascus expects Mr Assad to relinquish the 'portfolio of options', as one diplomat puts it, which such groups offer Syria as part of its bargaining position with Israel  -not, that is, until a peace deal is sealed. A 'full' peace between the US and Syria is, thus, likely to prove impossible until Mr Assad has sealed the same with Israel. For Mr Assad, says one European diplomat, 'the main obstacle on the road to normalisation of relations with Washington is Israel'. This is not to suggest that Mr Assad will agree to peace with Israel at any price. His price, return of the Golan and an 'honourable' settlement with Israel's other neighbours, has remained immutable. But his appearance with Mr Clinton in Geneva tomorrow suggests Mr Assad believes a deal is obtainable. If and when this proves so, the souq will be ready. 'It is the same for us,' says Samad the merchant. 'There is no liking here for the Jews, but we can sell to anyone.'</p>

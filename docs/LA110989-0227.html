			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BOXER'S BATTLING MOM SAYS SHE AND HER SHOE WILL SKIP REMATCH  </P> <P> Minna Wilson, who clobbered one of her son's opponents over the head with a  high-heel shoe, said today she won't be anywhere near the ring when Tony Wilson  and Steve McCarthy square off in a rematch of their light-heavyweight bout next  week.  </P> <P> "I have been going to his fights for years, even when he was an amateur, and  after fights I have shaken the lads' hands," she said today. "This time, I  don't know what happened to me."  </P> <P> She said she was merely reacting to chants shouted at her son by members of the  crowd that night last September in Southampton, England, shouts that she  considered racist. The Wilsons are black. McCarthy is white.  </P> <P> Wilson had just been floored by McCarthy in the third round at Southampton  Guildhall when his mom climbed into the ring, took off one of her high-heeled  shoes and started beating McCarthy over the head. McCarthy required four  stitches in his scalp and refused to continue the bout, which made headlines  around the world.  </P> <P> The referee awarded the decision to Wilson, the first loss of McCarthy's  career, and -- while upholding the judgment -- the British Boxing Board of  Control ordered a rematch.  </P> <P> Wilson and McCarthy are to meet again in suburban Reading on Nov. 15, where  promoter Frank Warren said there would be three times the normal number of  police and security guards to control the crowd.  </P></p>

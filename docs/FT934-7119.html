			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Tokyo stocks sink amid fears for financial system MOUNTING pessimism over the Japanese economy, a spate of poor corporate earnings figures, and heavy technical selling weighed down Japanese share prices yesterday, pushing the Tokyo market to an eight-month low. The Nikkei average of 225 leading stocks fell 1.2 per cent to 17,941.19, closing below the 18,000 level for the first time since March. Investors fear that further falls could damage the country's financial system, wiping out chances of Japanese banks writing off bad loans using gains on their stock holdings. Some brokers had hoped record low interest rates would bring investors back into the market. However, many investors believe that current share prices are too high, and do not fairly reflect the true strength of Japanese corporations and the underlying economy. The price/earnings ratio for the market stands at around 90 times, and low dividend yields, which currently average 0.8 per cent, are also no attraction. The Nikkei has lost 8.9 per cent since the beginning of this month, and although recent falls in the index have been exaggerated through technical selling related to a shift in trading of stock indices, overall sentiment over the economic backdrop remains gloomy. Interim earnings figures announced over the past few weeks have only reinforced worries over the country's economy. So far, 771 companies have reported unconsolidated half year results to September, revealing a 26.2 per cent fall in pre-tax profits and a 7.7 per cent decline in sales from a year earlier. The Bank of Japan said yesterday that signs of an economic pick-up in the second half of the year to March remain unlikely. Sectors other than housing investment and public spending were performing poorly. World Stocks, Page 21</p>

			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> MAN HIT BY GUNFIRE AT PARTY; SUSPECT HELD  </P> <P> A Saturday evening party turned ugly when one man was shot in the hip and  another was arrested for attempted murder.  </P> <P> "It was a gathering that went sour," Westminster police Lt. Andrew Hall said.  </P> <P> The evening began quietly enough, Hall said, when victim Pablo Ramirez Diaz,  32, of Westminster met several friends in a parking lot at 8421 15th St. to  socialize and watch a portable TV.  </P> <P> But two of the party-goers began to quarrel, Hall said, and one grabbed a  .45-caliber handgun.  </P> <P> Diaz, who was not involved in the argument, tried to get out of the way but was  hit in the hip by a single round from the gun.  </P> <P> Diaz was taken by a friend to Humana Hospital-Westminster, where he was  reported in stable condition Sunday.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the man suspected of shooting Diaz fled in his car but was arrested  later when he returned to the area where the party was held.  </P> <P> "It makes it real easy when they drive back. . . . It wasn't brilliant police  work," Hall said.  </P> <P> Arrested on suspicion of attempted murder was Eleazar Valle Rangel, 23, of  Westminster.  </P></p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / New chief for Czech sell-off agency The Czech Republic's privatisation programme is excepted to be speeded with the appointment on Friday of Mr Roman Ceska as chairman of the Czech National Property Fund, the state holding company responsible for privatisation. Mr Ceska replaces Mr Tomas Jezek, who resigned after charges that the agency was selling state assets on the cheap. Mr Ceska said he would put proposals before the board of the NPS this month: 'I want to speed up the privatisation process.' The official reason for Mr Jezek's resignation was a potential conflict of interests between his position at the NPF and his imminent chairmanship of a parliamentary budget committee. But he said he had stepped down because of 'continuous attacks' on him in recent weeks. Fierce rivalry between the NPF and the Privatisation Ministry has been a feature of the Czech privatisation process. Politicians have accused the NPF of acting independently of the government and of reaching agreement with investors without seeking approval from parliament. Tension increased after several high-profile sell-offs, including the sale of a stake in Czechoslovak Airlines to Air France and after a DM3.5bn (Pounds 1.4m) investment in the car maker Skoda by Volkswagen, Europe's biggest car maker, turned sour. Mr Jezek accused the board, headed by Mr Jiri Skalicky, privatisation minister, of disrupting the NPF's operations and trying to undermine his position. Mr Skalicky said the board asked Mr Jezek to resign because it was 'dissatisfied with the pace of realisation of privatisation projects'. The NPF is responsible for selling stakes in state companies to domestic and foreign investors and is a shareholder in much of Czech industry.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Lukic, prime minister of the Srpska </F> republic of Bosnia, by Fausto Beloslavo in Pale on 16 April:  "Rest Assured, We Will Protect the Bosnians"]    [Text] Pale -- Vladimir Lukic used to be an engineer,  lived in Sarajevo, and once worked for the United Nations for  six months. Then the war upset everything and people changed  careers. Now 61-year-old Vladimir is the prime minister of the  Srpska republic of Bosnia, whose armed forces control 70 percent  of the martyrized former republic of Yugoslavia. He agreed to  grant L'INDIPENDENTE an exclusive interview in his office, where  several telephones with numerous science-fiction-like lines -- a  symbol of power in this region -- occupied a conspicuous  place.    [Beloslavo] Today (yesterday for the reader --  L'INDIPENDENTE  editor's note) your militias have entered Gorazde after several  months of siege, in open defiance of the UN resolutions which  declared the enclave a "safe area"...    [Lukic] We do not consider Gorazde a United  Nations-protected  area, because it was never demilitarized. There are some 12,000  to 15,000 Muslim soldiers over there. What we are involved in  is merely a counteroffensive. Our generals have asked the  Bosnians to surrender, telling them that their lives will be  spared. We want no more massacres.    [Beloslavo] What will now happen, following NATO's air  raids?    [Lukic] If the attacks continue, the Balkans will explode,  but I would rather not even think of such a possibility. This  is not like the Gulf War. This conflict is different from, and  worse than, previous ones. There are many dangerous weapons in  Europe, some of which are under control, whereas others are  not...    [Beloslavo] Are you referring to ultranationalist Russian  leader Zhirinovskiy's threats?    [Lukic] We cannot take his statements too seriously, but we  are not underestimating them either.    [Beloslavo] What do you think of Italy's role in making its  bases available for NATO's attacks on your positions?    [Lukic] Your country took part in the aggression against  Serbia, but I see no reason why we should prolong this conflict.  We respect your minority in the former Yugoslavia, and some  Italians are fighting by our side...    [Beloslavo] Italians? Do you mean those trained in Krajina?    [Lukic] I am not speaking only of the Garibaldi Battalion,  but of many who lived and worked in Trieste or other Italian  towns, and who have returned to fight where they were born.    [Beloslavo] So, no missiles will be launched against Italy?    [Lukic] If it were not for the bases, we would not even send  a carrier pigeon in your direction, you would have nothing to  fear. But you know very well that there are hardly any nations  by now that do not have aircraft or missiles which can be used  against neighboring countries, without distance being any  problem.    [Beloslavo] Is it true that you also bear the Vatican a  grudge?    [Lukic] We have made our criticism known for the Vatican's  support of sanctions against Serbia, and also for having favored  the former Yugoslavia's dissolution in several ways. Recently  we have received a number of different signals, which make us  hope that relations will improve.    [Beloslavo] Are you asking for the head of UN troops  commander in Bosnia General Rose?    [Lukic] It is true that we can no longer sit at the same  negotiating table as the person who ordered the air attacks.    [Beloslavo] Are therefore hopes of peace becoming flimsier?    [Lukic] The result of the adventure attempted by the United  States, which aimed to create a Croatian-Muslim federation in  Bosnia excluding the Serbs, was to eventually pave the way for  NATO's aggression. In such a situation, we cannot talk of peace.</p>

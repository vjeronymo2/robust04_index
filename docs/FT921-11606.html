			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Barrick and Newmont agree on development of Nevada deposit AMERICAN BARRICK and Newmont Gold, after failing to consummate a merger last year, have signed an agreement in principle to co-operate in developing their properties in the northern sector of Nevada's rich Carlin Trend gold deposit. The chief executives of the two companies said yesterday that the agreement 'effectively realises many of the benefits' identified during last year's abortive merger talks. Final details of the pact are expected to be completed soon. It includes development of the Deep and Lower Post ore body adjacent to Barrick's Goldstrike mine, as well as exploration and development along common property boundaries, and sharing of Newmont's bioleaching technology. The Post body straddles the border between the two companies' properties and contains an estimated 9m troy ounces of gold. Barrick has agreed to expand its existing Betze pit at Goldstrike to include Deep and Lower Post. The expanded pit will be known as the Betze-Post pit. Stripping of the expanded area is due to start next year, and mining of most of the Deep and Lower Post ore will begin in 1997. Mining of the Post body will also give access to 580,000 ounces of gold from near-surface material on Newmont land. Until now, neither company has shown gold from the Deep and Lower Post body in its production forecasts. Newmont owns 5m ounces of the Post deposit, while Barrick's share is about 4m ounces. The companies plan to share the costs of mining the Deep and Lower Post reserves in proportion to benefits received. Production costs will thus be the same for both companies. They said that an agreement for joint exploration and sharing of data will enable 'rapid and economic development' of new discoveries along common boundaries.</p>

			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> POLICE FIRE ON LOCKED-OUT BLACK WORKERS IN S. AFRICA  </P> <P> Police opened fire today on black employees outside a pie factory where they  had been locked out by management. At least 15 workers were injured, police and  union officials said.  </P> <P> Police also arrested anti-apartheid activist Mohammed Valli Moosa, an official  of the banned United Democratic Front and a leader of a new campaign to defy  apartheid restrictions.  </P> <P> He was arrested at his Johannesburg office today and held there as security  police searched his files.  </P> <P> There was no immediate indication what charges might be filed against Valli  Moosa, one of three activists who escaped from detention last year and took  sanctuary at the U.S. Consulate in Johannesburg.  </P> <P> The Food and Allied Workers Union said scores of workers assembled today  outside the Mama's Pies factory on Johannesburg's southeastern outskirts, a day  after the company locked them out because of a 4-week wage dispute.  </P> <P> The union said police used whips and live ammunition to disperse the workers  and made several arrests. The union said 15 workers were injured, some  seriously.  </P> <P> In another development, Trevor Tutu, son of Nobel Prize-winning Archbishop  Desmond Tutu, was sentenced today to 18 months in prison for allegedly making a  false bomb threat at Johannesburg's international airport.  </P> <P> Tutu's 32-year-old son was convicted of violating the Aviation Act by falsely  telling police that there was a bomb in his luggage.  </P> <P> Shortly after the Dec. 31 incident, Trevor Tutu convened a news conference and  told reporters that he deliberately courted arrest as part of a publicity stunt  on behalf of his advertising agency.  </P></p>

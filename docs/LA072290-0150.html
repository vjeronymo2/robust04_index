			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL MISCELLANY  </P> <P> Names and Numbers  </P> <P> * Runless Redbirds: Whitey Herzog or not, the beat goes on for the St. Louis  Cardinals, who through 90 games had scored three or fewer runs 50 times and two  or fewer 38 times. Said Pedro Guerrero: "It's embarrassing.  </P> <P> I'd probably quit and go home like Whitey did if they'd tell me I'd still get  my money, like he is."  </P> <P> * Fearsome Twosome: Andre Dawon and Ryne Sandberg continue to brighten a dismal  summer for the Chicago Cubs. Each is on a pace to drive in more than 100 runs.  The Cubs haven't had two players do that since 1970, when they had three --  Billy Williams, 129; Jim Hickman, 115, and Ron Santo, 114.  </P> <P> * Rebounding: Montreal Expos first baseman Andres Gallaraga has started to  emerge from a long slumber, collecting five home runs, seven doubles and 18  runs batted in during his last 17 games, through Thursday. Amid talk of a trade  involving Gallaraga, Manager Bob Rodgers said: "He's been in a two-year slump,  but if he ever gets going, like he's starting to now, he can carry a club. I  say don't trade him."  </P> <P> * Tribute: Don Robinson, battling an arthritic hip and timebomb knees, is 6-1  for the San Francisco Giants. Said Manager Roger Craig: "He's the best  competitor I've ever had play for me, the best I've ever played with and the  best I've ever played against." ROSS NEWHAN  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Regulation for Traders to Be Proposed: Responding to charges of cheating in  U.S. futures pits, the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said  the agency will propose a bill by July 1 to require all traders to register  with federal authorities. In a letter to Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman  Patrick Leahy, CFTC Chairman Wendy Gramm said the agency will also propose  regulatory changes in trade monitoring standards and dual trading by September  if those changes are warranted. Some critics say exchanges, now required to  keep track of all trades to the nearest minute, should be required to tighten  the standard, called the audit trail, to prevent unscrupulous traders from  cheating.  </P></p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Cross-Channel wine buying - is it worth it? / There may be more bargains in Tesco than in Calais THE government does have other things on its mind, but when will someone draw its attention to the absurdities entailed by the relaxation of duty free personal allowances? There is something absurd about the current mass deployment of Customs and Excise officers in undercover operations and dawn swoops, all to track down lorry loads of French beer imported by duty evaders selling on what was supposedly for their personal use. As each petty villain is expensively brought to trial, another is surely risking his axle in some Calais car park under the weight of booze, supposedly but, preposterously, for personal use. Another absurdity is the current cross-Channel traffic in bottles and people. British wine merchants who have had the enterprise and energy to establish outposts in northern France (see below) have been despatching wines back across the Channel so that they can be packed into a British boot and trundled back across the waves for the third time as part of a duty free personal wine allowance. British wine (and beer) drinkers meanwhile are deliberately crossing the water on booze-buying day trips. With Dover a new Malmo, isn't it time to lower our duties to more European levels? Almost certainly, but for the moment there are (a few) circumstances in which it makes sense to import your own wine. Technically, the recommended guideline for wine enthusiasts is a duty free allowance of 90 litres (or 10 cases of a dozen bottles) of still wine or 60 litres of sparkling wine - although the controls on this at Channel ports are increasingly minimal. A special provisioning trip across the Channel could be financially justified only if there is a particularly large celebration in view. As it happens, cheap champagne is one of the very few bargains to be had in French supermarkets which have been retailing this serious rival to our own elderflower cordial for under FFr50 (Pounds 5.82) a bottle this year. But it is worth bearing in mind that cheap champagne is just that  - a thoroughly reliable detonater of any ill feeling. The other (drinkable) wines which represent good value if bought in the better (ie larger) French supermarkets are basic red bordeaux - which, like champagne, has loss leader status in France - and southern French reds. Those carrying the name of a property usually, although not invariably, taste less industrial than generic examples. It is generally possible to find a serviceable petit chateau claret or a decent Corbieres for about FFr12 (Pounds 1.39) a bottle. The conventional British line on French supermarkets is that their wines are unthinkably inferior to those on sale in Britain. It is perhaps unpatriotic of me to suggest otherwise but this is an outdated view. They have improved enormously over the last three years or so and many could offer British wine enthusiasts some reasonably good buys in classed growth claret - until sterling's fall from grace. Today it makes sense to buy only the very cheapest wines in French supermarkets, at a price level at which the nearly Pounds 1 a bottle UK excise duty makes a real difference. But I have yet to find any cheap white or pink wine in a French supermarket that seemed a good buy. The standard price for very dull Muscadet, for example, is FFr19.95 or about Pounds 2.30, which is no saving in terms of flavour per penny in comparison with, for example, wines such as Tesco's zesty Australian White or the sumptuously packaged Languedocien Domaine du Bois Chardonnay 1992 at Pounds 2.99 until July 17. There are many other ways of buying wine in France, however. You could buy your own vines, through Wineshare on 0306-742164. The Cotes de Duras red, white and rose which is made on your behalf works out at Pounds 2.50 per bottle if collected in Boulogne. Probably best value is to buy direct from a really fine producer if you happen to be on holiday in the region anyway. The annual Guide Hachette des Vins, FFr159 (Pounds 18.53) available in most French bookshops, is the direct line to ratings of individual wines and telephone numbers. It also includes a directory of cavistes, or specialist wine merchants, which are so much rarer across the Channel. Those travelling through St Malo should visit Le Tastevin in a backstreet near the port for Christian Papin's quite sumptuous red Anjou-Villages 1990, FFr35 (Pounds 4.07) and Graillot's Crozes-Hermitage 1990, FFr53 (Pounds 6.17). But the British wine buyer will probably feel most at home at the trans-Channel branches of British merchants. The Wine Society's near Le Touquet is merely a members' collection point for cases of a restricted but good quality range. The Grape Shop of Clapham's shop in Boulogne carries several hundred different wines, more than 30 per cent of them from the New World and other sources outside France. Although they are buying most French wine direct, they find stocking difficult enough since the average customer is British and buys six cases of wine at a time. Richard Harvey, on the other hand, has been trying to rescue a high proportion of his stock, imported from England, from the douaniers of Cherbourg since his Maison du Vin opened on June 1. This week The Grape Shop recommended as its best buy a Chablis 1991 at FFr39 (Pounds 4.54) - a minuscule saving indeed on Majestic's current parcel of creditable Chablis 1991 at Pounds 4.99, and Tesco's slightly leaner example reduced to Pounds 4.99. The last time I scoured French wine shops, in May, I noted a Cahors that looked promising at FFr49. A much better buy is Majestic's Cahors, Ch de Quattre 1987 and, even better value, 1988 which they are selling for a laughable Pounds 2.99, without even a suggestion of sea sickness.

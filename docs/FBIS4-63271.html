			<p>BFN     [Text] Issues concerning supplies of modern weapons to the  Ukrainian Armed Forces and use of the country's unique  industrial and scientific-technical potential became the center  of attention at a briefing held yesterday at the Ukrainian  Defense Ministry. Lieutenant General Lev Hnatenko, first deputy  chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Armaments and chief of the  Armaments General Headquarters, spoke with journalists in detail  about Ukraine's implementation of international agreements on  nuclear disarmament and reduction of conventional weapons. He  emphasized that, despite economic hardships, Ukraine is able,  and should, produce military equipment which would be comparable  to the world's best standards and become competitive on world  markets.    Lt. Gen. Hnatenko also reported on certain problems of  material provisions in the process of servicing already existing  weapons. However, the main conclusion is that the Ukrainian  Armed Forces is equipped with all necessary means to perform its  tasks, which are aimed at protecting Ukraine's sovereignty and  territorial integrity.</p>

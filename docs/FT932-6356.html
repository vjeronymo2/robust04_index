			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Thorntons to restructure French business THE DETERIORATING French economy has forced Thorntons, the chocolate maker and retailer, to restructure its French business which is expected to make a loss of Pounds 1.8m for the year ending June 26. In March, Thorntons said it hoped that losses from its subsidiary might be less than the previous year's Pounds 750,000 deficit. Mr John Thornton, chairman and chief executive, whose family owns 48 per cent of the shares, said losses had been far worse than anticipated because of the severity of the downturn in France. The company is to dispose of 25 of its 60 sites and has appointed Mr John Coyle, a main board director, as managing director for European operations. As a result of this, the company is anticipating an exceptional charge of up to Pounds 7.75m. In addition, Pounds 2.5m previously written off directly to reserves at the time of the acquisition of the French subsidiary at the end of 1989 will also be charged to the profit and loss account. Last year the company made pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.2m. Mr Thornton said that while the restructuring would adversely affect this year's profits, he had decided that it was better 'to face up to the problem now than let it get worse'. Sales in France for the half year to January 9 rose to Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 4.6m). Interest payments increased to Pounds 650,000 (Pounds 478,000) with net borrowings at the half year of Pounds 4.8m. The group has suffered because of relatively high French interest rates.</p>

The ministers agreed to tackle the boycott issue, which had  been on the agenda at the Arab League meeting due to end in  Cairo Sunday, at their next session later in the year,  participants said.    "The climate is not favorable for lifting the indirect  boycott" on international firms dealing with Israel, because of  the February 25 massacre, a diplomat close to the Arab League  told AFP.    Two-thirds of the Arab League's 22 members would have to  support such a move if it came to a vote.    Gulf states Oman and Qatar recently began "intensive  efforts"  to ease the embargo, but "this lobbying effort did not get the  hoped-for results because of the Hebron massacre," the diplomat  said.    "All the other Arab countries want to maintain the indirect  boycott," according the diplomat, who asked that his name not be  used.    Since the Israeli-PLO autonomy accord was signed on  September  13, Washington has called for the indirect boycott to be lifted  in exchange for US participation in developing the Gaza Strip  and West Bank town of Jericho, the first two areas earmarked for  autonomy under the delayed accord.    For Syria the main issue was not the massacre of 30  Palestinian worshippers by a Jewish settler in the West Bank  town of Hebron.    Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' said the boycott  "cannot be lifted before Israel withdraws totally from occupied  Arab territories and the Palestinians create their own state."    Syria made no distinction between the direct boycott of Arab  trade with Israel and the indirect boycott, al-Shar' said.    Syria's official Tishrin newspaper said Sunday that Israel  "had not broken off the negotiations with Arab parties, but it  is also true it has made no step toward peace and made no effort  to help the peace process succeed."    US Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown said in January that Arab  League Secretary General 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid had promised to  raise the issue of the indirect boycott at the ministerial  meeting in Cairo.    As the session opened Saturday, 'Abd-al-Majid reiterated the  Arab states' condemnation of the massacre, and calls for  adequate international protection for Palestinians in the  occupied territories.    Arab countries have boycotted Israel since it was created in  1948. Three years later, they set up a body in charge of  drawing up a "black list" of international firms with interests  in Israel.    Barring Egypt, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in  1979, only Kuwait has lifted the indirect boycott, last year.    The Arab League also postponed debate on creating an Arab  court of justice and amending the league's charter, participants  said.</p>

			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / New push to end impasse on Efta-EC treaty FRESH efforts will be made in Brussels today to break the judicial deadlock that is the only remaining obstacle to signing of the European Economic Area (EEA) treaty, creating a 19-nation common trading zone, David Buchan reports from Brussels. The European Court of Justice threw the EEA deal into doubt last month by effectively striking down the agreement on a mixed EEA court, composed of European Court and European Free Trade Association (Efta) judges. Such a court would pre-empt the European Court in interpreting Community law, it said. EC and Efta negotiators have failed to find a compromise legally acceptable to the EC and politically tolerable to Efta states. The deadlock arises from the EC's view that the only way in which laws governing the 19-nation zone can be kept uniform is for its own court to predominate in disputes. Efta states have resisted rule by foreign judges. Efta negotiators will today offer a compromise. They will propose that the Luxembourg court deal with all competition cases involving EC and Efta companies or where any sizeable business turnover in the EC is concerned. This would be the majority of competition cases in the EEA zone. Purely Efta cases would be dealt with by a new Efta court. Efta also proposes that all disputes arising out of those EEA laws special to the pact, not just a mirror reflection of EC legislation, should be subjected to outside arbitration. Such special provisions include exemptions and transition periods for Efta countries to adjust to standard EC rules which will be the basis of the EEA arrangement. A first bid to resolve the issue failed earlier this month.</p>

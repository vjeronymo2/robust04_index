The forecast 2.4 percent growth target for the year starting  April 1 marks the lowest since the government set a target of  2.5 percent in fiscal 1974 on a real gross national product  (GNP) basis.    The latest EPA forecast is much higher than the less than 1  percent projected by most private think tanks. It represents  the agency's perception that the economy will shift to a  full-fledged recovery track by the end of the next fiscal year.    The 2.4 percent growth comprises a 3.0 percent rise in  domestic demand and a 0.6 percent shrinkage in external demand,  the officials said. They said the agency forecasts a current  account surplus for the year of 13.8 trillion yen, against the  14.4 trillion yen projected for the current year.    Consumer prices are forecast to rise 1.5 percent and  wholesale prices 0.2 percent.    The GNP growth projection for this fiscal year was revised  down to 0.2 percent from initially projected 3.3 percent, the  officials said.    The projections, reported to Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa  on Wednesday, will be finalized at a meeting of cabinet  ministers responsible for economic matters on Thursday.</p>

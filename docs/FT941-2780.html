			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Scotland (4): Tories redraw the map with ease - Local Government The map of Scotland is about to be changed by a bill which has so far passed with surprising ease through the standing committee considering it in the House of Commons. The bill will replace the current two tier structure of local government with a system of single tier authorities. It will also remove management of water and sewerage out of the hands of local authorities and entrust it to three new water authorities under boards appointed by the secretary of state. There are no plans to privatise Scottish water, but the private sector will nevertheless be heavily involved in upgrading the water and sewerage systems. The Conservative government signalled its intention of reforming Scottish local government in 1991, put out a detailed consultation paper in 1992 and last July presented its plans in a white paper. The white paper said the government intended to abolish the current system of nine regional and 53 district councils, and replace them with 25 unitary authorities. The three unitary island councils would remain unchanged, making 28 councils in all. All Scottish political parties have said they favour moving to a single tier system, but for the Labour, Liberal Democrat and Scottish National parties the move would accompany the setting up of a Scottish parliament. The government wants to modernise local government partly to take account of the fact that local authorities are gradually providing fewer direct services themselves. From a party political point of view the Conservatives want to weaken the dominance of Scottish local government by the Labour party. The Conservatives' chief target is Strathclyde regional council which, because of the unbalanced drawing of the last new map in 1974, deals with 2.2m people, nearly half the Scottish population. As well as being assertive in dealing with the Scottish Office, Strathclyde is, to the Tories, irredeemably Labour. Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, recently argued in the quarterly journal Scottish Affairs that the current structure, in which regional and district councils have powers which occasionally criss-cross, was complicated, illogical and expensive, partly because of the inadequate power of the districts. Some regions, he said, were too big to be effective, some districts too small; and they lacked independence because of councils' shared responsibility. The consequence, he said, was lack of public interest in local government, shown by low turnout in elections and the lack of public affection for the 1974 structure, especially the regions. Under the white paper proposals Strathclyde would be broken into 10 councils while the eight district councils in the Highlands would disappear, leaving a single authority based in Inverness. Apart from losing control of water the new councils would be expected to form joint boards with neighbouring authorities to administer such things as police and fire services. Some councils might administer certain services on behalf of their neighbours. The new councils will be elected in 1995 and begin operating in 1996. The main public reaction to the white paper was outrage at the way the new map appeared to protect those areas where Conservatives commanded a majority (such as Stirling, Ayr and Eastwood, to the south of Glasgow) by creating councils with smaller populations than their Labour-dominated neighbours, giving rise to the claim of gerrymandering. (Yet senior Scottish Office officials are said to have been surprised that the government did not go further in drawing up boundaries to Tory advantage). Apart from that, many people were perplexed that there is again to be change only 20 years after the 1974 reform. Professor Arthur Midwinter of Strathclyde University, a specialist in local government, argues that the two-tier system has worked well and that the white paper proposals would not necessarily make local government more accountable, or engender greater local loyalty than the present system. Above all, he says, if the government wants both to have effective local government and to achieve substantial efficiency savings it should set up not more than 15 authorities. The proposed structure, he says, will lead to greater centralisation because most of the councils would be too small to be viable. Small authorities would have difficulty providing all the services required, and bigger neighbouring councils might be unwilling, for political reasons, to help them out. Joint boards would lack the democratic legitimacy needed for decisive action. Labour-controlled Strathclyde region argues with come force that it offers considerable economies of scale in administering such services as education, police, fire, and transport over a very wide area. It operates the biggest passenger transport authority in Britain with British Rail providing an efficient and expanding commuter rail service whose coherence could be in jeopardy under a large number of councils. Lothian, a much smaller region which is nevertheless to be split between Edinburgh and two other councils, has also put forward a case for a single unitary authority. So far the only major concessions the government has made during the passage of the bill are on the boundaries of the new councils. Ayrshire is to have three councils instead of two, Inverclyde is to be carved out of West Renfrewshire, and Berwickshire is not after all to be merged with East Lothian. These changes, which make the gerrymandering charge slightly weaker, took place partly because of pressure from local Tories. But they mean that (including the three island councils) there will now be 30 new councils instead 28 and Strathclyde will now be broken into 12 not 10 councils. Mr Lang, asked by the Financial Times whether the reform would lead to savings and 'big improvements' in the cost of local government, said it was 'largely driven by the wish to create more efficient, more coherent, more accountable local authorities. I'm certain there will be savings of some substance as a worthwhile side-benefit. But it's driven by the natural allegiances, the history and traditions, Scottish geography and demography.' He went on: 'The strength and diversity of what we are proposing will result in having a single tier with a clear focus for the delivery of local services. The fact that we are able to contemplate savings which could amount to Pounds 1bn over a 15-year period is tremendous.' Mr Lang said he got the impression when he travelled round Scotland that the local government reform was a popular change. 'Let's be honest. A lot of people don't worry too much about how their local government service is delivered as long as it's delivered efficiently. If they stop to analyse why it's delivered inefficiently and expensively in many cases it's the result of the duplication and bureaucracy and the expense and inefficiency that two-tier structures bring.'</p>

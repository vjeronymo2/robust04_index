			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Hunting, trapping, and animal damage control activities are regulated inside and outside National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges. Most of the area within the wolf reintroduction area is remote and sparsely inhabited wild lands. There are some risks to wolf recovery that would be associated with take of wolves, other land uses, and various recreational activities. However, these risks are low because take of wolves should occur so infrequently that wolf recovery would not be significantly affected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service finds that the stated protective measures and management practices are necessary and advisable for the conservation and recovery of the gray wolf in the Park. No additional Federal regulations appear to be needed. The Service also finds that the proposed nonessential experimental status is appropriate for gray wolves released in Yellowstone National Park that are taken from wild populations. As discussed above, although once extirpated from its historic range in most of the conterminous United States, the gray wolf is common in western Canada (tens of thousands) and Alaska (about 7,000), and wolves are increasing in the Great Lakes area. The gray wolf has also recently been recovering in a small portion of its range in the western United States. Therefore, taking fewer than 100 wolves from these areas will pose no threat to the survival of the species in the wild.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An additional management flexibility would result from using the nonessential status for wolves introduced into the Park, due to less stringent requirements of section 7 of the Act (interagency consultation) for wolves that may occur outside National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges. Wolves that are part of the nonessential experimental population would be treated as animals proposed for listing, rather than listed, when occurring outside of a National Park or Refuge, and only two provisions of section 7 apply to Federal actions outside National Parks and Wildlife Refuges: section 7(a)(l), which authorizes all Federal agencies to establish conservation programs; and section 7(a)(4), which requires Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on actions that are likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the species. The results of a conference are advisory in nature; agencies are not required to refrain from commitment of resources to projects as a result of a conference. There are, in reality, no conflicts envisioned with any current or anticipated management actions of the Forest Service or other Federal agencies in the areas. National Forests are a benefit to the project because they form a buffer to private properties in many areas, and National Forests are typically managed to produce wild animals that would be prey to wolves. The Service finds that there are no threats to the success of the reintroduction project or the overall continued existence of the gray wolf from the less restrictive section 7 requirements associated with the nonessential designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The full provisions of section 7 apply to nonessential experimental populations in a National Park or National Wildlife Refuge. The Service, National Park Service, Forest Service or any other Federal agency is prohibited from authorizing, funding, or carrying out an action within a National Park or National Wildlife Refuge that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the gray wolf. Pursuant to 50 CFR 17.83(b), section 7 determinations must consider all experimental and nonexperimental wolves as a single listed species for analysis purposes. The Service has reviewed all ongoing and proposed uses of the Parks and Refuges and found none that are likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the gray wolf, nor will they adversely affect the success of the reintroduction program. Potential uses that could adversely affect success are hunting, trapping, animal damage control activities and high speed vehicular traffic. Hunting and trapping and USDA Animal Damage Control programs are prohibited or tightly regulated in National Parks and are closely regulated by State and Federal law and policy in other areas. There are very few paved roads in the proposed reintroduction area and wolf encounters with vehicles are likely to be infrequent. Even most of the unpaved roads are used seasonally, and are on the outside fringes of the reintroduction area. In addition, these unpaved roads typically have low vehicle traffic and are constructed for low speed use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Location of Experimental Population  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The release site for reintroducing wolves will be in Yellowstone National Park. The experimental population area will include all of the State of Wyoming, that portion of Idaho east of Interstate Highway 15, and all the State of Montana east of Interstate Highway 15 and south of the Missouri River east of Great Falls, Montana, to the Montana/North Dakota border. Comments obtained by the Service during review of the DEIS resulted in changing the boundary of the experimental population area to the Missouri River in central Montana (Service 1994). The Missouri River was chosen as the northern boundary because the record of wolf sightings and wolf mortalities indicated that, during the last several decades, wolves have occurred north, but not south of the river. The river may not act as a complete barrier to wolf movements, but current information indicates that, if wolves are found south of the river, they would likely be experimental wolves from the Yellowstone area. Wolves north of the river would likely be naturally dispersing wolves from northwestern Montana or Canada.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

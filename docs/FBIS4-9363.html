			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Iulian Nitu: "A Disquieting `Premiere'-- </F> Foreign Troops Have Crossed Romania in Great Secrecy; Who Has  Approved It and on What Grounds?"]    [Text] We have learned that a train with military  equipment has crossed Romania recently. It is true that this  act took place with the authorization of the United Nations.  Even if the equipment, though we do not know what it contained,  had this statute, the event acquires an extraordinary importance  through its political and strategic significance. Nevertheless,  there has been complete silence over this event. Apart from the  thieves who discovered and robbed it, and the heads of the  leadership, nobody knew about this train, although this issue is  of utmost concern to the public.    Why this fact was concealed, but mainly who authorized the  crossing of the respective train, is not known. Article 117(5)  of Romania's Constitution stipulates that "foreign troops cannot  enter Romania or cross its territory except under conditions  stipulated by the law." What law establishes the entry or  crossing of foreign troops we could not discover. Neither could  we discover to whom the law grants this responsibility.    No matter who it is and who has such an authority, we  believe  that this event is too important to be kept concealed from the  public. We do not say that we have anything against the  authorization for the transit of troops or UN military  transports, however, the fact itself is disquieting. The same  bodies that today had the right to decide in secret about UN  troops crossing Romania's territory certainly tomorrow will have  the right to approve with the same secrecy, far from the eyes of  the public, the "entry" or the crossing of other "equipment" or  troops, or even their stay in Romania. No matter to whom the  law gives this right, we believe that Romania's Parliament  should have a certain responsibility or connection with such  important actions. We believe this because, if the Parliament  discusses and decides on such an issue, normally the public is  also informed of it.</p>

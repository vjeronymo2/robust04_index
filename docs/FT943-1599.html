			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Property in London's West End (4): Long march of the planners - Rival schemes to develop Paddington's Victorian backwaters Twelve years on and the ambitious plan to regenerate the seedy West End fringe at Paddington is still just a blueprint. Delays, controversy and changes in ideology have dogged the project ever since Westminster City Council first designated Paddington in 1982 as a preferred location for large scale office development. And there is still more to come. In the past 12 months two giant commercial schemes intended to provide 3m sq ft of offices plus shops, cafes, small craft units and some 450 flats have become entrapped in the backlash of Westminster City Council's 'homes for votes' scandal. Paddington Station, a Grade I listed building, has been put on the market as one of the dozen or so stations for which Railtrack is required to find new owners under rail privatisation. Crossrail, the new Underground link between West and East London through Paddington, has either been scrapped or sent back to the drawing board. St Mary's Hospital's rebuilding plans are on ice while it waits to learn its fate in the reorganisation of central London hospital services. Only one of the private sector schemes - the entirely self-contained and independent extension of the Metropole Hotel on Edgware Road - is actually under way. Meanwhile, the public sector must content itself with progress on the London Heathrow Express; the rather more important Crossrail project was on, then off and, if it may be on again, it won't be just yet. Whatever their cause, the delays are acutely frustrating to planners, property developers and local residents who are united - if only in the general principle - in the need to eliminate the present tattiness. However, as 1994 moves into its final quarter, there is reason to hope that not all the Paddington plans may be irreparably stalled. Imperceptibly, perhaps, the two commercial schemes are starting to move ahead. Bishopsbridge, the joint venture between NFC and Regalian to develop the 13.5-acre Paddington Goods Yard north of the station, claims to be more advanced than its nearby rival, the Trafalgar House/ British Waterways redevelopment round Paddington Basin at the head of the Grand Union Canal. That is debatable. Bishopsbridge was 'launched' at the end of August four months after it received outline planning consent from Westminster Council. But the 'launch' amounted to no more than inviting a few more interested parties to visit the showroom in Mayfair which had been open for the past two years. Moreover, as NFC and Regalian already know to their cost, the gulf between outline and detailed permission can be difficult to bridge. A public inquiry after an earlier outline had been approved in 1989 meant a major rethink of the original scheme. The current artist's perspective and perspex model cannot be relied on as an accurate guide to the final appearance of the buildings. In that respect Trafalgar House may be slightly further ahead. In early September, it was in the final two weeks of negotiations with Westminster planners which would underpin its detailed planning application. The pretty pictures which Trafalgar is touting may, therefore, be closer to the future reality. But both have a long way to go before being set in stone. Trafalgar has not yet assembled its entire site; some owners remain to be bought out. Grainhurst (the vehicle for the Bishopsbridge scheme) has a vacant, but difficult, gully of a site to tie in with Paddington Station and the proposed new Underground station it must pay for as a condition of its planning permission. Meanwhile, both developers must bite their knuckles while they await the verdict of two independent investigations into whether the consents they have received had 'contaminated motives'. The District Auditor and a retired former County Planning Officer for Shropshire are both searching to see whether the council's housing policy has been based on sound planning principles or 'contaminated', like the designated house sale programme, by gerrymandering. Property professionals with no axe to grind are confident that the plans will win a clean bill of health. They point out that Westminster's insistence on mixed use developments in the Paddington area has a consistent history which relates to a transport policy of minimising traffic increases. Even if that is so, the two schemes then face their biggest gamble: the extent of future demand for office space in Paddington. With Bishopsbridge designed to provide 1.4m sq ft of offices and Paddington Basin more than 1.5m, the two schemes combined will amount to the largest West End development since the Second World War. And they are in an area which has always rebuffed developers' ambitions to push the West End westwards. Some think that St Mary's plans for a 950,000 sq ft terrace of offices on its western boundary (which would pay for new hospital buildings to the east) were ambitious enough for such a fringe area. Grainhurst cites the example of Broadgate which sceptics were adamant could not breach the City's northern boundary. Its executives also draw encouragement from research the company commissioned from the City University Business School. That shows that the top 10 agents in the West End agree that a shortage of top specification space is imminent, however long the hangover of substandard space remains. According to the consensus, less than one year's supply of prime space remains available and no new building over 100,000 sq ft. Given that West End stock has traditionally been in small buildings and the council wants to push large space users to the Paddington Special Policy Area, this must be cause for optimism. However, it has yet to translate into firm good news. Neither Trafalgar nor Grainhurst are close to a pre-letting which would persuade them to push ahead to the construction stage. No one doubts the area's main commercial attraction; its already excellent westwards connections will be further enhanced by the Heathrow Express Railway. With construction well under way the railway looks likely to meet its most recent completion target - December 1997. A journey time of just 17 minutes to Heathrow should impress international companies which do not need a prime Mayfair location but seek a relatively central position. But will enough of them want to locate in a deep dip beneath the Westway (Bishopsbridge) or in Trafalgar's community-oriented enclave on the edge of the Edgware Road?</p>

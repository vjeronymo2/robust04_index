			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Top ministers back us on Europe, says CBI: Hunt grilled on burden of social costs; Delors urged not to destroy jobs; Davies calls for tight spending control THE Confederation of British Industry yesterday claimed the support of the government's three main economic ministers for its campaign for European economic integration. Sir Michael Angus, president of the CBI, spoke out after Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, aligned himself firmly with the pro-European views expressed on Monday by Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. Sir Michael said the three ministers' speeches to the CBI conference in Harrogate showed that 'their views on Europe are in parallel with ours'. CBI leaders have been increasingly critical of the government's 'negative' approach to Europe, which some believe has damaged British economic prospects. Mr Hunt told the CBI conference in Harrogate that his speech to last month's Conservative party conference in Blackpool had been wrongly interpreted as an attack on European integration. 'My personal commitment to this country's place at the heart of Europe is central to my own personal political philosophy,' he said. Mr Hunt told delegates: 'Although we hear what you say about a single or common currency for Europe, we are focusing on the practical objectives of promoting economic recovery and economic convergence among the countries of Europe.' He said a single currency 'is not merely an economic policy - it would be an undertaking of enormous political significance as well'. Mr Hunt was careful to echo the vision of a decentralised, free-market and free-trading European Union set out by the prime minister at last month's European summit in Brussels. He said later, however, that he remained committed to 'the ultimate objective' of a single European currency. In spite of the consensus on Europe, Mr Hunt faced trenchant criticism from CBI leaders of the burden of social costs on industry. Mr Bryan Rigby, chairman of the CBI's employment committee, said employers were worried about reports that more of the cost of maternity and sick pay was to be shifted to business. 'We don't expect to find this government putting extra burdens upon us whilst criticising others for doing the same,' he said. Tax reliefs which expire at the end of the year when the Business Expansion Scheme winds up should be transferred into new reliefs for private investment in private companies, the CBI said yesterday. Mr Richard Brucciani, chairman of the CBI Small Business Council, said: 'Unless we change the way we do some things in this country, smaller businesses cannot deliver, cannot be the engine of recovery'. The demand for tax relief for people investing in growing business is part of a search for funding diversity. The CBI is concerned that small companies are too reliant on overdrafts. Mr Richard Head, chief manager of National Westminster Bank, said this was why banks offered small businesses term loans for up to 20 years. The clearing banks, he added, had Pounds 43bn of loans outstanding to companies with annual turnovers of less than Pounds 1m.</p>

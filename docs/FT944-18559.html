			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / International Company News: First results for Ina since privatisation Ina, the Italian insurance company, reported parent company pre-tax profits of L250bn (Dollars 160m) for the first half of 1994, in its first results since June, when the Italian treasury privatised 51 per cent of the company. Comparison with last year's figures is misleading, because until October 1993 Ina benefited from compulsory contributions from other Italian insurers, but the company pointed out that in the whole of 1993, its pre-tax profit amounted to only L274bn. Group premium income reached L2,970bn, up 12.8 per cent on the equivalent period, L1,218bn from life activities, and L1,752bn from non-life.</p>

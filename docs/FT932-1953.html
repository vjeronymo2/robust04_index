			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Heseltine heart attack adds to Conservative worries MR Michael Heseltine's heart attack yesterday deprived the British government temporarily of one of its most powerful figures. Mr Heseltine, who had been on a two-day holiday in Venice with his wife Anne, was visited by two British doctors in hospital yesterday afternoon. Having flown back to the UK last night, they were due to return to re-examine Mr Heseltine at the end of the week. He was admitted after complaining of chest pains shortly before 3am yesterday, and was said later to be sitting up and talking, having undergone medical tests. His illness is a further blow to the administration, which has been hit by a string of setbacks. It will weaken its ability to deal with the political disasters that seem to afflict the government in the weeks before parliament disperses for the summer. The trade and industry secretary had been due to finish a set-piece House of Commons debate tonight on the difficult subject of Tory party funding. Conservative managers were relying on his oratory to unite the party's backbenchers. The debate will now be concluded by Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, who lacks Mr Heseltine's rallying skills. The controversy over donations to the Tory party, and in particular those from Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman, spilled over to Mr Heseltine's visit to Venice, where Lord McAlpine, former party treasurer, lives for much of the year. 'I saw Mr Heseltine in Venice but we did not discuss Asil Nadir. There's no reason why we should talk about him. We have nothing to discuss about Mr Nadir,' Lord McAlpine, said last night on his return to London. Downing Street said Mr John Major had been told about Mr Heseltine's illness yesterday and had sent flowers and good wishes for a speedy recovery. In Copenhagen for the European Community summit, the prime minster said: 'I have sent Michael a message. I hope he will soon be well and will soon be back at work.' Westminster colleagues were shocked by the news because Mr Heseltine was widely known for his resilience and stamina. Mr Heseltine's official diary has been cleared for the rest of this week, with his junior ministers sharing extra work. No one expects him to resume his full duties immediately after that. Mr Tim Sainsbury, the trade minister, is the next most senior minister at the department and is expected to represent Mr Heseltine at ministerial meetings for the time being. Hospital officials in Venice last night said Mr Heseltine, aged 60, was recovering in a coronary department intensive care unit and that his condition presented no serious complications.

			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ NOTES: TRIBUTE AWARD TO TRUMPETER CONTE CANDOLI  </P> <P> Conte Candoli, the ace be-bop-style trumpeter who has gained renown working  with Stan Kenton, Woody Herman, Supersax and Doc Severinsen, has received the  eighth annual Tribute Award from the Los Angeles Jazz Society, it was announced  Thursday. Other awards, including the society's Lifetime Achievement Award and  Educator Award, will be announced later. Candoli will be feted at a banquet at  the Los Angeles Hilton Hotel and Towers on Sept. 9.  </P> <P> "I'm overwhelmed, to say the least," said Candoli, who joins guitarist John  Collins, pianist Gerald Wiggins and others in receiving the prestigious honor.  "This is about jazz, and that's what we all started out to do. We may get  sidetracked a bit but we always get back to the main thing. I really appreciate  it."  </P> <P> Candoli -- who will appear July 11 to 13 with drummer Frank Capp at Stingaree  Gulch in San Pedro -- was 16 years old and living in his native Mishawaka,  Ind., when he began his career with Herman in the summer of 1945. "My brother,  Pete, got me that job. As I think back, I owe all of this to Pete," Candoli  said. "He started me off and was my main influence."  </P> <P> Roy Eldridge and Dizzy Gillespie also served as musical models for the  trumpeter, who, after working with Kenton from 1952 to 1954, moved to the  Southland to work with Howard Rumsey's Lighthouse All-Stars at the Lighthouse  Cafe in Hermosa Beach. There, from 1954 to 1959, he played alongside such  stalwarts as saxmen Bud Shank and Bob Cooper, trombonist Frank Rosolino and  pianists Claude Williamson, Sonny Clark and Victor Feldman.  </P> <P> "Stan Levey (ex-Kenton drummer) got me on that gig," recalled Candoli, who will  turn 63 next Thursday. "I had left Kenton and was back home in Indiana and he  called me, asking me if I wanted to come out to the Coast. It took me about one  second to respond. 'You got it!' I told him."  </P> <P> Another job Candoli joyfully remembers was with Shelly Manne at the late  drummer's jazz haunt, Shelly's Manne-Hole in Hollywood, from 1961 to 1968.  "Working with Shelly was fantastic," he said. "I had played with him all my  life, with Woody (Herman) and Stan (Kenton) and at the Lighthouse. But I  enjoyed working his club the most. Just about anybody that was anybody --  Coltrane, Miles, Art Blakey, Shearing, Oscar Peterson -- was there, and we got  to play opposite them (splitting sets)."  </P> <P> In 1972, Candoli joined Severinsen's "Tonight Show" crew -- a job he called  "the greatest."  </P> <P> " 'The Tonight Show' enhanced my career," he said. "It made me comfortable, so  when I go out and play jazz, I'm in a good frame of mind. It gives me a sense  of security, and that feels good. It certainly never dampened my desire to  play. I may go on vacation and lay off for a week, but that's about it."  </P> <P> Candoli can also be heard with Bill Berry's L.A. Band at the Los Angeles County  Museum of Art at 1:30 p.m. on July 29, and on that same day, with Tommy  Newsom's Orchestra at Warner Park in Woodland Hills at 5:30 p.m.  </P> <P> PIANIST SCORES MANNE AWARD: Pianist Cecilia Coleman has been selected as the  recipient of the Shelly Manne Memorial New Talent Award, which, as part of the  annual LAJS awards, is given to a promising young local musician. Coleman, 27,  has worked with vibist Charlie Shoemake (she also studied improvisation with  him), saxman Benn Clatworthy and trombonist Jimmy Cleveland.  </P> <P> Coleman, who has been a professional since the age of 19, is busy this weekend.  She works with bassist Henry Franklin at the Overland Cafe in Palms tonight and  with singer Shelly Moore at Coffee and More in Long Beach Sunday. She'll also  be with Cleveland's octet at the Catalina Bar &amp; Grill in Hollywood on July  25.  </P> <P> The pianist, who appears on Clatworthy's soon-to-be-released "Thanks, Horace"  (Discovery), cites Red Garland, Bud Powell, Mulgrew Miller and Benny Green as  her chief influences. "Those are the ones I most listen to," she said. "I'm  also very fond of Woody Shaw. If I could play piano like a horn player, I'd  like to play like him."  </P></p>

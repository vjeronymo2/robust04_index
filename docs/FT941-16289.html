			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Observer: Out of focus John Gummer's celebration of the British capital - 'London, making the best better' - makes much of its position as a leading financial centre. But the environment secretary ought to have had a word with his brother's public relations firm when compiling the section on finance. A picture entitled 'Bank dealing floor' is quite obviously no such thing. Clearly visible in the background above the milling crowds of dealers is the legend 'London International Financial Futures Exchange'. The bit on the foreign exchange market also contains the puzzling information that it has 544 'listed companies' compared with 119 in Tokyo and 87 in New York.</p>

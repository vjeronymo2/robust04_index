			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 16 Apr (INA) -- BABIL has stated that our  people and the international community as a whole must remain  fully alert in order to confront the U.S. insinuations and  designs aimed at harming Iraq by all possible means, both inside  and outside the UN Security Council.    In an article today, the paper says that the incident  involving two helicopters in Iraqi Kurdistan demonstrates to the  entire world the nature of the complicated and dangerous  situation faced by that dear part of Iraq under the coalition  troops. It says that this situation requires the employment of  all possible political means to secure the withdrawal of the  aggressors from the region and the return of the Iraqi state to  Kurdistan in order to help our Kurdish people and serve peace  and security in the entire region.    BABIL adds that, since the latest UN Security Council  session  on so-called human rights, the United States has been engaged in  a systematic campaign against Iraq and has accused it of  masterminding attacks against UN officials and observers in  Kurdistan. This is despite Iraq's repeated denials of such  allegations. This proves Washington's premeditated intentions  against Iraq, especially to carry out a fresh aggression against  Iraq, perhaps without referring to the Security Council.</p>

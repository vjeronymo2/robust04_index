			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Romanian IMF deal delayed by budget ROMANIA will have to amend its 1993-1994 budget and make further spending cuts before a new stand-by arrangement with the International Monetary Fund can be signed, Mr Misu Negritoiu, deputy prime minister, said in an interview yesterday. The delay in signing a new IMF agreement to replace the previous one, which expired in March, is holding up some Dollars 3bn in foreign credits. Mr Negritoiu, who has responsibility for economic reform, said the IMF put the 1993 budget deficit at 5 to 6 per cent of GDP, rather than the 4 per cent projected in the budget approved in April. He said that if parliament accepted the amendment before the summer recess, a new agreement could be negotiated by July. A nationwide train drivers' strike severely disrupted services for the second day running yesterday. SNCFR, the railway administration, declared the strike illegal and pledged to take action against union leaders. Under Romanian regulations, one-third of services must be maintained even during a general strike. The train drivers' union called its 32,000 members out on strike on Monday, demanding a 40 per cent pay rise rather than the 16 per cent offered by the government.</p>

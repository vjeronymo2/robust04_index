			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Defense Minister Volker Ruehe  (Christian Democratic Union) plans to save billions of German  marks in the armed forces in the future by tightening and  rationalizing the operation of the Bundeswehr. In the Bundestag  Defense Committee, the minister announced in Bonn on Wednesday  [18 May] that in the Bundeswehr, too, work is going to be done  as much as possible along the line of business management. The  goal is to "rationalize and, wherever useful, privatize" the  entire operations through "internal optimization." By the end  of the 1990's, the Defense Ministry is to be restructured and  the staff is to be reduced by 38 percent, from 5,200 to 3,300  employees. Ruehe told DPA that he expects a "broad consensus"  among the parties for his concept.    Ruehe bases his plans on the investigations of the "Work  Group for Limiting Expenditure in Operations" (AGAB), which was  established in March 1993 and headed by General Lorenz Huber.  In cooperation with civilian consulting companies, Huber showed  possibilities to save up to 35 percent of personnel and 25  percent of costs. By optimizing operations over the next years,  up to 2 billion German marks [DM] per year could be saved just  in equipment maintenance and administration. Ruehe explained to  the deputies that the storage of material and stock management  must be made considerably more economical.    According to Ruehe, depot organization must be centralized  far more. The repair facilities of the Army, Air Force, and  Navy will be newly organized. Considerable numbers of personnel  are to be reduced. The transportation sector and the  telecommunications system of the armed forces will be  rationalized and modernized. The restructuring of logistics  requires "a keener awareness for using the scarce resources  efficiently" at all leadership echelons of the Bundeswehr,"  Ruehe stressed. Motivating the employees for the set targets is  one of the keys to success. The military commanders must see  "that saving in their sphere of responsibility pays off."    The Defense Ministry is to "be brought back to its basic  tasks." Its organization structure will be tightened to  facilitate speedy processes of command and decisionmaking. The  military command staffs, the civilian departments, and the  Armament Main Department will be maintained "in a balanced  degree." The assignment and responsibility of the inspector  general and the inspectors of the units will not change.    In the Command Staff of the armed forces, however, "the  ministerial tasks of the military sector will be concentrated."  The civilian part of the ministry will get a "largely new  structure, which will be more functional." There will be a new  Department for Personnel, Social, and Central Matters (PSZ).  The Legal Department will also be reorganized. The Armament  Main Department will be reduced to the ministry's basic tasks.    According to Manfred Opel, defense expert of the Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SDP], a "rationalization potential  is lying fallow" in the Bundeswehr, "which adds up to about DM4  billion." If, for instance, the "scrap" of the former National  People's Army (NVA) of the GDR [German Democratic Republic] in  84 storage facilities, on which a lot of money is spent for  guarding it, were to be immediately disposed of privately, at  least DM300 million could be saved.</p>

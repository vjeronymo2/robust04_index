			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: North Housing Ass to build 1,750 homes North Housing Association achieved a surplus of Pounds 13.7m from turnover of Pounds 41.5m in the year to end-March, despite the continuing decline in 'right to buy' sales, which contributed Pounds 900,000 less than last year. The outcome compared with a surplus of Pounds 12.2m from turnover of Pounds 37.3m last year. Directors said the total surplus would be reinvested for the benefit of people in housing need. The association intends to start building 1,750 new homes in the current year, for which the expected total expenditure is Pounds 76m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] The Tibet Autonomous Region has achieved results in  reforming its cultural system, resulting in increased cultural  and art activities. In the past few years, Tibet's literary and  art workers have stressed the importance of the people's  cultural life. Last year, despite a shortage of funds, Tibet  built six county cultural halls, outlined the "Dandelion Plan,"  formed a regional cultural and art committee for young children,  and actively conducted training for budding talents in  literature and art.    The autonomous region reformed the movie-screening system,  consolidated movie-screening teams in rural and pastoral  regions, and screened 100 films on patriotism in the entire  region.    After a year's work, Tibet made further progress in its  concept of the reform of the cultural system. Last year,  various professional art groups produced 98 scripts and held 435  performances which a total of 350,000 people attended.</p>

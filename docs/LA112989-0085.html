			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MAINE;  </P> <P> BLOCKADES TO SEARCH CANOEISTS BARRED  </P> <P> Armed state officials had no right to set up a "riverblock" to stop and search  people canoeing on the Saco River, Maine's Supreme Court ruled. Two state  agencies set up the riverblocks on three weekends in 1988 to try to stop rowdy  and illegal conduct. The justices agreed unanimously with a lower court judge  who said the searches violated the federal and state constitutions. The ruling  came in a suit by Daniel and Jarlene Hatfield of Rochester, N.H., who were  searched extensively.  </P></p>

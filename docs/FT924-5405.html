			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / International Company News: Royal Bank of Canada buys travel insurers ROYAL Bank of Canada (RBC) has become the first Canadian bank to acquire an insurance company with its purchase of Voyageur Insurance, Canada's largest underwriter of travel insurance for retail travel agents. The seller is Crawley Warren Group, the UK insurance brokers specialising in accident, health and aerospace business. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Voyageur writes about CDollars 100m (USDollars 78m) of premiums a year, and has 180 staff in six offices. Financial service reforms implemented last June allowed Canadian banks for the first time to acquire insurance companies, but put strict limits on links between banks and their insurance subsidiaries, mainly to protect brokers. For instance, the banks were barred from using their extensive branch networks or their employees from selling insurance policies. However, Mr John Hudson, Voyageur's president, said that the link would benefit both his company and the bank. Voyageur may expand into the US, where RBC already has a presence and where the market for travel insurance is less developed than the UK or Canada. Petro-Canada, the national oil company partially privatised two years ago, has raised CDollars 250m with a 30.4m-share issue placed with a syndicate of underwriters led by RBC Dominion Securities at CDollars 8.25 a share. Proceeds will reduce long-term debt to CDollars 1bn and bolster working capital. The underwriters were given the option of a further 3.1m shares. The federal government's holding will fall to 70 per cent from 80.5 per cent.</p>

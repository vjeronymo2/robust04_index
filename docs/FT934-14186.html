			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (6): Rapid advances worldwide - Privatisation and liberalisation outside Europe - In Latin America, telecoms privatisation is advancing at a speed that makes Europe's progress appear positively glacial BEYOND Europe, privatisation and liberalisation are advancing wordwide in the telecommunications industry. But they have many faces, and an array of contrasting approaches are to be found. The US (covered in separate articles on page 8 of this survey) is a world unto itself, with its unique history of telecoms development and its distinctive regulatory structure. Since many of the strategic partners and inward investors shaping the industry in other regions are US companies, particularly the regional Bell operators, US practices are making themselves felt worldwide. This is particularly true of the US propensity to test regulatory barriers and licence conditions in the courts. But nowhere has it led to a private operator regime as complex or confrontational as in the US. Elsewhere, the most dynamic regions are Latin America and Asia-Pacific, with China looming on the horizon and likely to dominate investment priorities in the industry if its government proceeds with further telecoms liberalisation  -see Asia reports on page 10 of this survey. In Latin America, privatisation is advancing at a speed that makes Europe's progress appear positively glacial. Most of the region's leading operating companies have been privatised, or soon will be. In Europe, state budget deficits are a prime factor in privatisations. In Latin America, governments also want the cash; but privatisation has also been treated as a prime vehicle for attracting strategic partners to take the lead in building new lines and modsernising infrastructure as fast as possible. In the last few years, Argentina, Mexico, Chile and Venezuela have all sold majority shares in their national telephone companies while Brazil, Uruguay, and Costa Rica have privatisation programmes in the offing. In all cases, modernisation was - and is - a more important concern than competition; but pressure to liberalise is growing nonetheless. Telmex, the inefficient Mexican state operator, was privatised as a monopoly in 1991. According to Goldman Sachs, its licence binds it to achieving average annual line growth of 12 per cent until 1995, and six per cent a year from then to 2000. Barely 8 in 100 Mexicans haver a line at the moment. From 1997 Telmex will face competition in the long-distance market. CTC, Chile's national operator, has Telefonica, Spain's national operator, as a strategic partner with a 44 per cent stake. Line growth in Chile is expected to be a remarkable 23 per cent this year; long-distance traffic has grown by 25 per cent a year since 1988. By the end of this year, CTC will have an all-digital network. In Argentina, two privatised operators, both with foreign partners, divide the country between them. Stakeholders in Telecom Argentina, which has the north of the country, include STET of Italy, France Cables and J P Morgan, the investment Bank; Telefonica de Argentina is 60 per cent owned by a consortium which includes Citicorp, the US bank, Banco Central and Telefonica of Spain. Venezuela's national operator, CANTV, was sold last year; 72 of the Dollars 1.89bn raised came from international companies participating in the consortium that bought a controlling interest in the company. Spain's Telefonica features yet again. In Brazil, a political debate is raging over whether to abolish the state's constitutionally-guaranteed telecoms monopoly over telecoms operation, seen as an essential first step towards privatisation. Telebras, Brazil's state-owned telecommunications holding company, has become the leading light on the Sao Paulo stock exchange, thanks to foreign investors anticipating opportunities to come. Peru joins the privatisation league in December, when the country's two state operators are to be sold off. Peru has one of the worst networks in Latin American, with barely 2 lines per hundred people. If the sales go as planned, the buyers will be obliged to invest Dollars 1bn to expand the network overthe next five years. The monopoly will be left intact for five years, on condition that the winning bidder doubles the number of lines in that period. Unsurprisingly, Telefonica is an interested party in Peru, along with AT&amp;T, GTE and South-Western Bell of the US, the UK's Cable and Wireless, France Telecom, STET of Italy and Korea Telecom. They are likely to form bidding consortia with established equipment suppliers. such as Siemens, By contrast, Asia-Pacific offers a more varied picture, with countries positioned across a wide spectrum of development. However, in marked contrast to Latin America, the strategic investor model has to date found little favour anywhere in the region. For the region's more developed countries, privatisation and liberalisation are primarily intended to give a greater impetus to developing already advanced networks. Mr Andrew Harrington, telecoms analyst with Salomon Brothers in Hong Kong, expects telecoms companies with a total market capitalisation of Dollars 70bn to be put up for sale in the region by the year 2000. Of that, around Dollars 20bn will be available for investors. 'In 1990, there were only four companies you could buy: two in Japan, Hong Telecom, and Philipines,' says Mr Harrington. 'Now there are in excess of 20, and the number will burgeon in the next decade.' Singapore Telecom is the privatisation nearest on the horizon. The country already has one of the most sophisticated telephone networks in the world: it is looking to private investors largely to give it still greater dynamism and international clout. State operators in Korea, Australia, Thailand, Indonesia and India are all candidates to follow on - though in some cases (notably Australia), governments are publicly denying the prospect. In the region's developed countries, liberalisation is proceeding fast. In Hong Kong, local services are to be liberalised from 1995. Japan, which permitted competition as long ago as 1986, now has three long distance carriers competing with NTT, two international carriers competing with KDD, and four new cellular operators. In Australia, Optus, the competitor to state-owned Telstra, benefits from a favourable regulatory regime and is expected to have a 25 per cent market share within five years. Even tiny New Zealand, which three years ago its state carrier entire to a consortium led by Bell Atlantic and Ameritech of the US, now has one competing long-distance operator and two new cellular operators likely to set up in the next year. For developing countries in the region, foreign investment is geared primarily to building new lines. In most cases, monopolies have been preserved, with overseas investors encouraged to contract to build lines as a partner of the state operator, using 'build, operate, transfer' (BOT) arrangements. In a few cases, notably the Philippines, a liberal regime has been created for the job. Thailand is the most significant BOT market. Japan's NTT has a stake in Thai Telephone and Telecom, a private company with a BOT contract to build 1m lines in the provinces. TelecomAsia, a consortium in which Nynex, the US operator, has a 15 per cent stake, is contracted to build 2m lines in the region. 'This could be the model for many future ventures,' says Mr Arthur Troy of Nynex, TelecomAsia's chief operating officer. 'For us, it's a novel form of operation, but seems to be working well.' India is sharing in the novelty. This summer its government granted US West a Dollars 100m contract to build a telephone network in a south Indian town, in a move widely seen as the first nail in the coffin of the state's telecoms monopoly. In the Philippines, four predominantly overseas consortia are constructing networks - which they will own as well as operate. Between them they will install some 3m new lines - in a country which currently has only 900,000 lines. Three new cellular networks are also under construction. The BOT model has obvious attractions for other developing regions, notably Africa. Kenya, Nigeria and the Sudan are all considering telecoms privatisation programmes, under the tutelage of the World Bank. By they time they get there, state-owned national telecoms operators may be as old-fashioned as much of their telephone networks. US developments: page 8.

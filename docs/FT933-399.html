			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Siebe There are two reasons why Siebe's management changes are more than routine. The first is that they carry the personal stamp of Mr Allen Yurko, who is to become chief executive next year when Mr Barrie Stephens hives that role off from the chairmanship. The second is that they increase the group's focus on the upper end of the system controls market which is grouped around Foxboro. Such a shift in emphasis may be natural given the 16.3 per cent margins Siebe earned from its controls division last year. But much of this originates from Foxboro, where the earnings contribution has been boosted by cost-cutting. With the rationalisation phase now largely over, Foxboro must turn its attention to increasing volume and market share. Its achievement in this regard - its share of the US controls market has increased from 6 per cent to around 10 per cent over the past couple of years - has already brought it into head-on confrontation with Honeywell. Siebe is suing its rival over marketing literature which it regards as defamatory. Since Honeywell will not give further ground easily, Foxboro, whose tactic is to seek a reputation for quality, may find its margins suffering. Siebe may thus face a choice between the hard slog of organic growth and the short cut of buying market share through acquisition. The hard part for Mr Yurko will be to find the right companies at the right price. As other acquisitive companies are finding, there are not many suitable targets around.</p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Sport: Racing 4,000 miles to a photo-finish - The third leg of the Whitbread race ends today. It will be close / Sailing During the past three days the Tasman Sea has been almost a psychiatric ward for sailors. The Whitbread fleet has been converging on Auckland for probably the tightest finish of a single leg in the history of the race. Competitors have been just a few miles from rival yachts, desperately trying another sail combination or a better downwind angle in the hunt for another ounce of speed. Kiwi nationalism is adding to the competitive spirit. Four of the leading half-dozen boats have either New Zealand crews or skippers. What the All Blacks are (or were) to rugby, so the NZ sailor is to professional yachting. Ross Field, in charge of the W60 class Yamaha, is a typical example. With 24 hours of racing left, Field was in third place just 11 miles behind fellow New Zealander Chris Dickson at the helm of Tokio. Both yachts are funded by Japanese sponsors. 'Tension is rising and we know we've got a boat race on our hands. I get terrified every six hours just before we get a new position update on the computer,' said Field over the Inmarsat link. Having been pre-race favourite in the W60 class, Yamaha has had a disappointing race so far but first place into Auckland's spectacular Waitemata Harbour would compensate for a great deal. 'We are carefully planning the slightest move on deck. Everyone aboard is aware that we can't afford the slightest mistake in either the way we sail the boat or the tactics.' British skipper Lawrie Smith, at the wheel of the pan-European W60 entry Intrum Justitia, is one of Field's tormentors. Several times the satellite race results system has shown them in joint first place with an exactly equal distance remaining to Auckland. Since joining Intrum just a few days before the start to leg two, Smith has shown himself capable of finding extra speed in the radical and still somewhat unexplored W60 class. Just pointing the boat at the finish and trimming the main is no longer enough. 'A top helmsman can get another knot out of these W60s in comparison with a journeyman. They are that sensitive,' he said. 'Working the sails a bit you get another. Get the exact right sail up and you'll get another. 'Suddenly you're doing 17 knots rather than 14 and in a six hour period you've taken a big chunk out of the guys you're chasing.' This analysis certainly held good in the first few days at sea after leaving Fremantle. In that period Winston, skippered by the America's Cup legend Dennis Conner with six New Zealanders among the crew including co-skipper Brad Butterworth, made a brave and successful break. This time last week Winston was 150 miles ahead of the nearest pursuer. The lead had been gained by diving south in the first days out of Fremantle. Conner's gamble paid off when his crew found stronger breezes on the bottom edge of the Roaring Forties. However, Smith has justified his reputation as one of the most calculating minds in yacht racing. Choosing his own course and consistently moving a knot or so faster than the opposition by sailing better angles, he reeled in Conner and then passed him. Yesterday, Winston lay second, five miles behind Tokio. Chris Dickson, driving Tokio with the single-minded determination which is his trademark, played much the same game as Intrum. However, in spite of Dickson's undoubted brilliance he may be too much of a one-man band on board. In the endgame of earlier legs he has helmed for up to 30 hours non-stop, but the knife-edge approach to Auckland has simply taken too long for that to be possible. And in the middle of this knife-fight is the maxi-ketch New Zealand Endeavour. Although racing in a different class to the fleet W60s, skipper Grant Dalton has the most overpowering of reasons to want to lead the Whitbread armada into Auckland. In the 1989 / 90 Whitbread he was in charge of Fisher &amp; Peykel, the ketch that was narrowly beaten on every leg by Steinlager II. Dalton looked likely to be first into Auckland as the two yachts approached the outer reaches of Waitemata Harbour with F&amp;P fractionally ahead. Off Bream Head a sudden squall knocked both boats flat. Steinlager II recovered quicker and crossed the line six minutes ahead. Dalton's chagrin was agony to behold. This time he has had to endure the W60s overtaking NZ Endeavour as the breeze freshened, then regaining the overall lead as the weather went light once more. 'Morale had started to sag a little when the wind didn't moderate. Watching the 60s scream past doing two to three knots more than us was not a pretty sight,' said Dalton. 'Now if the weather stays light we've got every chance of being first in.'</p>

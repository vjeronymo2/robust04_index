			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Observer: Changing the arts show Next Thursday promises to be a red letter day for Britain's arts world. The 225-year-old Royal Academy in Piccadilly, Britain's most exclusive arts club, assembles to pick a new president to replace Sir Roger de Grey, who has reached 75, the statutory retiring age. The voting ritual is arcane. By secret ballot the 80-odd Royal Academicians can nominate anyone, including themselves. Four votes is all that is needed to make the next round, then the top two candidates fight it out, leading to a final confirmatory vote. Before the new president can take over, the RA's secretary, Piers Rodgers, must phone the Queen for her approval, and Sir Roger must hand over his golden chain of office on the staircase of Burlington House. Since the RA has plans to absorb the adjacent Museum of Mankind and make it a museum of architecture, an architect would seem an obvious choice. The two favourites are Cambridge professor Colin St John Wilson, who designed the new British Library, and Sir Philip Dowson, founder partner of Ove Arup. Both are over 70, which would be ideal for a stop gap, but the RAs might want a younger man to raise the cash for the new museum. The spotlight thus turns on two 56-year-old artists, Tom Phillips, an enthusiastic candidate, and Allen Jones, who has lived down his past as a pop artist of suggestively sexist furniture.</p>

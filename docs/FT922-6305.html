			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / European Bonds: German bunds rally as return of positive sentiment continues THE RETURN of positive sentiment to European government bond markets continued last week, but this time the German market led the way. The first reason for the rally in bund prices was the decision of IG Metall, the engineering union, to accept a compromise settlement with employers over pay. The second spur to a rally came on Friday, with money supply statistics for April proving far less awful than feared. M3 grew by 8.8 per cent during the month, down from 9.4 per cent in March. This is outside the central bank's 3.5 to 5.5 per cent target range, but well below the 11 per cent growth forecast by some analysts early in the week. Any further rise in interest rates is now seen as unlikely and by Friday attention was again turning to when the Bundesbank will ease monetary conditions. Opinion is split on the timing of the next cut, but there is widespread agreement bund yields are heading lower. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew is forecasting 10-year bund yields at around 7.30 per cent by the year end, from 7.92 per cent on Friday. Lower bund yields should pass through into other European markets, since investors judge the relative value of markets on the basis of the yield spread to the bund market. For example, by the end of last week French government 10-year bonds were yielding 8.5 per cent, or 58 basis points more than their German counterparts. If this is maintained, French bonds should yield 7.88 per cent by December. However, there are additional gains to be made where the yield spread over German bonds narrows. French bonds are so popular with international investors at present that a narrowing of yield spread is quite possible. The French government auctioned FFr12.8bn two-year and five-year paper last week  -but received bids for FFr53bn stock.</p>

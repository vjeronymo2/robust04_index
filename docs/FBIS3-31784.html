Doboj correspondent Mirudin Aldobasic reports on the  situation in the 7-South Operative Group operational zone and  says that ``the chetniks are still fiercely attacking Maglaj and  the surrounding villages. They are using tanks, artillery, and  infantry weapons. [Words indistinct] the town center, but also  the civilian residential areas in the Maglaj area. The defense  positions at (?Bijela Foca), Jovici, Krsno Polje, Pazarici, and  Nekolj are being targeted. However, the defenders of the 201st  Chivalrous Brigade are successfully repelling all the attacks.  The fighting is still in progress as I file this report.    "The enemy this morning resumed fierce attacks on the Doboj  front. He attacked the defense lines from the agricultural  cooperative Putnikovo Brdo to (?Karus). The members of the 203d  Motorized Brigade Doboj-Bosna are successfully repelling the  attacks, while the members of the Croatian Defense Council 110th  Glorious Usora Brigade are repelling the enemy attacks at  Raskrsce and (?Svaline) which began in the afternoon hours. The  Tesanj area is also exposed to fierce enemy attacks. The town  itself was shelled this morning, and the defense lines in the  region of Bandera, Plandiste, and [name indistinct] have also  been attacked."    Bihac correspondent Mirza Sadikovic reports that "there is  not a single inch of territory on the forward defense lines  running from the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau, Hasin Vrh, and  Grabez to the barracks on Grabez that was not hit by at least  one shell. Since the morning hours, Bihac and its outskirts are  being destroyed by howitzers, mortars, multiple rocket  launchers, and Bofors. The material damage is immense and there  is a significant number of casualties." He says that the  members of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 5th Corps have today  stopped fresh chetnik attacks at Grabez and Hasin Vrh, which  were directly supported from the area of the so-called Serbian  autonomous province of Krajina. "In addition to this," says  Sadikovic, "provocations intensified on the demarcation lines  with the remains of the para-army of the so-called Kladusa  autonomy. According to the Velika Kladusa War Presidency, all  those who in any way supported the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army were  arrested."    The studio announcer says that "at 1050 [0950 GMT] the  ustashas from Kiseljak launched a fierce artillery attack at  Fojnica."    Dino Polic reports on the situation there and says that "the  ustasha criminals from the area of Trilj, [name indistinct],  emptied a multiple rocket launcher round of ammunition,  comprised of 12 107-mm shells, on the town. The consequences of  this cowardly shelling are several lightly and seriously injured  citizens, two of whom are Croats. The material damage is  immense."</p>

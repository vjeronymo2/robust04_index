			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Institutions fail to block Bosch's bid for Worcester A GROUP of institutional investors in Worcester Group, the UK's largest manufacturer of combination boilers, has failed to block an agreed bid for the company by Robert Bosch, the German industrial conglomerate. The institutional shareholders had claimed to the Takeover Panel that the bid considered management's interests at their expense. The institutions, holding 27 per cent of Worcester's shares, said they were concerned the offer could set a damaging precedent for non-management shareholders in future. 'As a matter of principle, it was important for us to pursue the matter,' said Mr John Thompson, head of UK equities at Standard Life who was active in formulating the challenge. The shareholders argued that the offer violated the first principle of the Takeover Code which requires all shareholders to be treated fairly. The shareholders sought to challenge a decision by the Takeover Panel's executive which approved the agreed bid for Worcester offering management different terms to those offered to shareholders. Worcester is 38 per cent owned by members of the management and their families. Before making its offer public, Bosch also obtained irrevocable commitments to tender shares from investors holding another 13 per cent of Worcester, making it impossible for any other bidder to succeed with a counter offer. Standard Life and five other institutional shareholders retained City stockbrokers Cazenove to represent them before the panel. Under terms of the agreement, institutional shareholders will receive 225p in cash for each of their shares while members of the management will have a stake in a new company and can earn up to 393 1/2 p per share when they are finally bought out by Bosch in 1996. However, they may earn as little as 100p per share depending on the company's performance. Yesterday, the panel, while conceding that management shareholders were receiving different terms than other shareholders, said it accepted the assertion of Worcester's financial advisers, Smith New Court, that the value of the two offers were roughly equal. 'On the evidence provided to it, the panel saw no reason to question these judgments and, in addition, the panel was satisfied that the appropriate risk as well as reward was present in relation to the management shareholders' retained equity interest,' the Takeover Panel said in a statement yesterday. Meanwhile, Mr Peter Lee, deputy director general of the Takeover Panel executive, said the decision should not be seen as precedent setting. 'I don't think any inferences should be drawn about future cases,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, May 26 (AFP) -- Bosnian Prime Minister  Haris Silajdzic flew Thursday [26 May] to Zagreb for emergency  talks on the situation in the Bihac pocket in northwestern  Bosnia, under Serb attack, Bosnia's representative said here.  Silajdzic, who headed his delegation at two days of peace talks  in the French lake resort of Talloires, near Switzerland, flew  from Geneva aboard the same plane taking back the Bosnian Croat  delegation, Mustapha Bijedic said.    It was not immediately known who Silajdzic would be meeting  in Zagreb, but Bijedic said "the situation was very serious" in  the Moslem-held Bihac pocket. "The Serbs have launched an  offensive against one of the UN safe areas in Bosnia (Bihac) and  Mr. Akashi (the UN's special envoy to Yugoslavia) and the West  are doing nothing," Bijedic said.    The UN Protection Force in Bosnia (UNPROFOR) confirmed that  Serb forces have launched an offensive over the past 24 hours  against Bihac, the western tip of Bosnia tucked into Croatia and  besieged by Serb forces. The Serbs managed "a small advance"  after firing more than 500 shells at Moslem positions on  Wednesday, UNPROFOR said.    Bijedic refused to give any details on the two days of  closed- door talks Wednesday and Thursday in the French Alpine  hideaway which involved the warring parties, along with  representatives of the United States, Russia, the European Union  and the United Nations. The parties have agreed however to meet  again in about 10 days, he said.    Aleska Buha, foreign minister of the self-proclaimed Bosnian  Serb Republic, said the talks would again take place in  Talloires.</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / A certain lack of drive: Ralph Atkins on the prospects of a shakeout among direct-selling insurers in the UK Are the UK's telephone-based motor insurance companies that sell policies direct to customers running out of puff? The pioneering Direct Line company, set up by Mr Peter Wood nine years ago in conjunction with Royal Bank of Scotland, was doing all it could yesterday to dismiss suggestions that the current motor premium price war would jeopardise its future expansion. Nevertheless, City forecasts for Direct Line's profits next year were cut after the company admitted the price war was having an impact, albeit 'marginal', on its profitability. Its admission was the latest sign that the UK direct private motor insurance market - selling via the telephone, and cutting out brokers and their commissions - is becoming increasingly crowded. With 15 direct sellers in operation, competition is fierce; rumours of possible casualties in the next few years are growing. 'There will be a shake-out among the 'directs'. The winners will be those that have got the money to stick with it . . . Anyone who starts to write (policies) now is not going to succeed unless they come up with a radically different approach,' says Mr David Campbell, insurance industry specialist at actuary Bacon &amp; Woodrow. Bacon &amp; Woodrow figures suggest that, between 1990 and 1993, the private motor insurance sector only broke even - in spite of large increases in premium rates. 'The market as a whole doesn't make money. It is a question of who makes money and who loses it,' says Mr Campbell. Motor premium rates are falling steeply as new 'direct' companies cut prices to grab market share. The most profitable will be those able to keep their claims plus expenses lowest as a proportion of premiums (operating ratios). Direct Line is well placed to ride out the current price war, with one of the lowest operating ratios in the business. But Mr Wood acknowledges that the doubling in Direct Line's pre-tax profits, to Pounds 110.1m in the year to the end of September, is unlikely to be repeated. Hence Direct Line was eager yesterday to outline its long-term plans for a joint venture to sell motor insurance directly in Spain and to develop new product areas - particularly mortgages, saving products and life insurance - as well as expand its port-folio of household property policies. Some other 'direct' companies are not faring so well, especially those new in the market that face large start-up costs, including the heavy advertising spending needed to build a customer base. Bacon &amp; Woodrow calculates, for example, that last year the operating ratio of Churchill, the direct selling company owned by Winterthur of Switzerland, was among the highest in the sector, possibly because aggressive pricing had cut its premium income. Some established insurers that still rely on broker networks have also been able to undercut the operating ratios of the 'directs' by using the same computer technology to improve their risk assessment, thereby increasing profitability. According to Direct Line's Mr Wood, some of his rivals have achieved only a lacklustre performance because of their failure to be sufficiently original in following his lead. With motor insurance policies now sold by telephone as if they were relatively simple commodities, the first into the market can quickly build brand recognition and exploit economies of scale. Some appear to agree with Mr Wood, and have tried to aim for a particular target market. Admiral, the direct selling arm of Brockbank, one of the largest agencies running insurance syndicates at the Lloyd's of London market, has focused on higher-risk motorists paying more than Pounds 300 in annual premiums. In a flattering endorsement of its strategy, Mr Wood has followed Admiral by setting up a new company, Privilege Insurance, for the non-standard motorist. But others which have set up 'direct' operations in the private motor market have taken a more defensive approach. Commercial Union and General Accident, two of the UK's largest composite insurers, decided not to spend heavily on promoting CU Direct and GA Direct, which remain among the smaller operators in the private motor market. At first sight, their stance appears to offer the worst of both worlds: the expense of setting up a direct operation without the benefits that a substantial presence can bring. But there is a logic to such a strategy: given the ferocity of the competition in the private motor insurance market, there is little point in investing heavily now. But it may prove important in the long run to have built the expertise and capabilities needed to exploit the technology of telephone selling. 'We don't believe it is opportune at this time to push it heavily. Next year or after may be different,' says Mr Nelson Robertson, group chief executive at General Accident. The critical factors that will determine whether such caution is wise are the speed and extent to which direct selling techniques spread to other insurance products. Already many direct selling insurers are expanding into household policies. Direct Line underwrote 523,000 policies in the past year, and the company believes there are substantial opportunities for selling other financial products by telephone. 'People don't like driving down to the high street, waiting in a queue, getting a form as long as War and Peace and having to take a day off to fill it in,' says Mr Wood. Several companies are even studying the feasibility of selling property and motor insurance to companies without a broker network. Mr David Stevens, marketing director at Admiral, says: 'Direct selling can work for any insurance product which doesn't require a huge degree of perceived risk or a huge perceived need for advice.' Cutting out brokers allows companies not only to cut costs, but also to break the 'winner's curse' - that is, the tendency for brokers, if commissions are roughly equal, to sell insurance policies that have been underpriced, rather than policies that actually make a profit for the insurance company. But others are more sceptical about the scope for expanding direct selling. Many life insurance companies reckon UK regulatory requirements, designed to ensure consumers are properly informed before buying products, mean telephone interviews are suitable only for making an initial contact between seller and buyer. Similarly, the complexity of mortgage products may make them inappropriate for selling by telephone. Moreover, Mr John Carter, Commercial Union's chief executive, argues it is far from certain that direct sellers can make the same inroads into home and contents insurance as they have in motor. Much of these markets is linked to the mortgage-providing business, where the main operators have the financial clout to defend market share in any price war. 'The opposition is not the high-street broker, it is the big banks, building societies and lending institutions that can react to the pressure from the 'directs' and find ways of competing with it,' Mr Carter says. Similarly, the profitable underwriting of small commercial policies requires careful risk assessment based on local knowledge, he argues. In the US, growth in direct sales of personal insurance products has slowed recently (though in the US, 'directs' includes companies using tied sales agents as well as those relying on telephone selling). But CU, along with most European composite insurers, nevertheless sees direct selling techniques becoming an increasingly important distribution channel. Though hesitant about joining the price war in UK motor insurance, CU is looking to build its share of the French private motor market via Eurofil, its direct selling operation in that country. Insurance companies such as these want to ensure that they avoid the worst consequences of a shake-out in the direct UK private motor market  - but not lose out to rivals as telephone selling spreads into new markets and products. Telephone sales in the motor market may be becoming more difficult, but the direct sellers are unlikely to pause for breath for long.</p>

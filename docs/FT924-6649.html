			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / October lending sharply up A BIG rise in lending by banks and building societies last month encouraged hopes that the economy may be on the mend. The increase was partly a rebound from a large repayment of loans in September, while demand by consumers for bank credit remains weak. Lending by banks and building societies in sterling increased in October by a seasonally adjusted Pounds 5.1bn, the biggest monthly figure for nearly two years, the Bank of England said yesterday. The rise followed a repayment of loans of Pounds 1.1bn in September. Mr Simon Briscoe, an economist at brokers Greenwell Montagu, said that the figures for the two months showed the economy was 'still weak'. The British Bankers' Association said the nine biggest UK commercial banks increased lending by a seasonally adjusted Pounds 3.2bn last month, the biggest rise since February 1990. It followed a repayment of loans to those banks of Pounds 1.3bn in September. The rise in bank lending partly reflected large borrowing by manufacturers to pay corporation tax. Manufacturers increased lending by Pounds 728m, on a non-seasonally-adjusted basis, the biggest rise since June 1988. Against that, demand from consumers remains weak. Although lending for house purchases continued to rise the increase of Pounds 335m lent for mortgages from the nine banks was the smallest since January. Excluding mortgages, consumers repaid credit to the nine banks of Pounds 542m, the largest repayment since the BBA started monthly records in 1986. Other Bank of England figures showed the amount of money in the economy expanding modestly in October. M0, the narrow measure of the money supply, mainly comprising notes and coins in circulation, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 per cent in October to show a year-on-year rise of 2.4 per cent. In the year to September, the figure was 2.3 per cent. M4, a broader measure, which takes in bank and building society deposits as well as notes and coins, increased by 1.0 per cent in October. The year-on-year rise was 5.4 per cent, as against 5.1 per cent in the 12 months to September. Britain's public-sector borrowing requirement was overfunded by Pounds 9.1bn in the first six months of the 1992-93 financial year, the Bank of England reported yesterday. The overfund reflected drawings on the UK foreign currency reserves to defend sterling in September; foreign borrowing by the government; and official sales of government gilt-edged stock.</p>

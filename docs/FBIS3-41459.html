He is a 1960 graduate of Moscow State University's  Department of Mechanics and Mathematics. He got his scientific  training (in 1964-76) working at the USSR Academy of Sciences  Central Institute of Economics and Mathematics, a center of  ``economic dissent'' where mathematics served as the Aesopian  language of market-oriented economists. In the latter half of  the 1970's he was head of a laboratory at the USSR Scientific  Research Institute for the Study of Systems. In the 1980's he  established and headed the Department of Ecology under the USSR  Council of Ministers Economic Academy. He took charge of the  Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources in  late 1991. Danilov-Danilyan is a doctor of economic sciences and  a professor. He is married and has two sons.    Bayduzhiy: What is your assessment of the current  environmental situation in Russia?    Danilov-Danilyan: It is very alarming. Ecological  systems are very vulnerable, and the first steps toward  destruction of our country's environment were taken back in the  1930's, when we began industrializing without the slightest  regard for the environment. There was the Stalinist plan for  transformation of nature, a plan that declared human beings to  be nature's master. We did not renounce that concept even when  in the late 1960's all the developed countries concluded that we  must live in harmony with nature.    The current environmental situation was almost fully defined  10-12 years ago, i.e. in the early 1980's. That applies both to  Russia as a whole and to its individual regions. An additional  ``contribution'' was made by the Chernobyl disaster in 1986.  Over the past three years our country's environmental situation  has on the whole not worsened. That is due to two factors.  Firstly, the decline in production has played a certain role,  due to the accompanying decrease in pollutant emissions. Though  for fairness' sake I must add that the decrease in industrial  pollution has been smaller than the drop in production. There is  nothing surprising about that: the first thing that enterprises  do when they find themselves in a difficult situation is to cut  corners on environmental protection. First they shut down  pollution control equipment, and only after that do they shut  down production operations. Nevertheless, the amount of  pollutant emissions in Russia has gone down.    The second factor that has prevented the state of the  environment from worsening in recent years is that beginning in  1988 our country began taking steps to create an environmental  protection system. 1988 was the year that a USSR environmental  protection agency was established, followed by republic and  local agencies. These organizational steps, accompanied by the  introduction of an economic mechanism to regulate natural  resource use, have definitely produced a positive effect. In  December 1991 a law entitled ``On Environmental Protection'' was  passed, making environmental impact assessments mandatory for  all projects. Incidentally, that stipulation is being followed  very strictly. In 1992 more than 55,000 project documents were  prepared at the federal and regional levels, and nine percent of  them were rejected in their entirety. In 1991 30 percent of all  documents were rejected. That means that people have become  afraid of environmental impact assessment and are no longer  submitting outright nonsense for assessment.    However, not all documents undergo environmental impact  assessment, particularly those adopted at the highest level. For  example, when the government passes a decree regarding  development of a system of Black Sea ports, we cannot do an  impact assessment of that document, simply because it does not  outline any specific projects. Hence the conclusion that we need  to expand the range of documents that undergo assessment. It  will be necessary to pass several legislative acts before we can  do so, and I think those acts will pass in 1994.    Bayduzhiy: How is the system of pollution payments  structured?    Danilov-Danilyan: At the present time those  payments are distributed between non-budgetary environmental  funds and the budget. Overall, 90 percent of pollution payments  go to non-budgetary funds at the federal level, federation  component level and local level. Those three levels receive 9,  27, and 54 percent of the funds, respectively. That is to say,  more than one-half of all environmental protection money remains  directly at the local level and is used for specific  environmental protection projects.    Bayduzhiy: Currently many environmentalists are  arguing over how to assess the environmental situation in Russia  -- as a crisis or a full-blown disaster. Which viewpoint do you  support?    Danilov-Danilyan: Neither one. One can only speak  of a crisis situation with regard to a number of urban  agglomerations and aquatic systems. For example, a crisis  situation exists along the Iset River, which flows through  Yekaterinburg, and in Lake Ladoga, and thus in the Neva River as  well. Even the situation on the Volga is still in a pre-crisis  state, though of course that is no reason for complacency.    Nor should we forget that Russia has 7 million square  kilometers of land that have not been touched by commercial  activity in any way whatsoever. No other country in the world  has that. Excluding Antarctica, that is only a little bit less  than in all the rest of the world combined. Therefore, if we  were to talk in terms of a human ecological reserve, then lands  in Russia would comprise the largest section of it. Essentially  this includes one-third of Russia's territory.    Bayduzhiy: Are you more optimistic about the  prospects for improving our country's environmental situation  now than you were when you became minister?    Danilov-Danilyan: You know, strange as it may  seem, the answer is yes. For example, when I became minister I  was not certain that we would be able to collect pollution  payments the way we should. Now that is happening. Of course,  many enterprises simply do not have the money to pay, but that  is another problem. Their debt continues to accumulate; the  system itself is functioning. The problem is not the system, but  rather our country's economic situation. I also had serious  doubts about whether we would be able to get the environmental  assessment system going. But now it is up and running. So in  terms of many parameters one can view the situation in a more  optimistic light than before.    Bayduzhiy: What is your view of Russian Navy  dumping of radioactive wastes in the Sea of Japan and the events  that followed?    Danilov-Danilyan: The problem of how to deal with  the radioactive wastes generated by nuclear submarines and  icebreakers has been ignored for decades. We have accumulated a  huge quantity of liquid radioactive wastes, which we have  traditionally dumped at sea. All this was described in detail in  a ``white book'' published in April 1993, a report containing  data which even Western governments, our negotiation partners,  are not eager to release. Maybe we revealed even more than we  should have, but that is a different topic. It is clear that the  process of liquid radioactive waste creation cannot be halted  all at once, even if every nuclear reactor were to be shut down.  In late summer 1993 our eastern bases experienced a critical  situation, with all their storage tanks filled. Unless unloaded,  one of the tankers could have literally fallen apart, and that  is essentially what did happen to it a short time later. The  decision was made to dump -- there was no other choice -- 900  cubic meters of polluted water with a total radioactivity of  0.38 curie into the Sea of Japan. That is an insignificant  amount of radioactivity; that much is literally flying around in  the air. By way of comparison, a conventional coal-fired  heat-and-power station with a capacity of one million kilowatts  releases at least one curie each day. Large stations release  15-20 curies into the air every day. The dumping was carried out  in Russia's economic zone, 180 kilometers off shore, in a part  of the sea that is more than 3,000 meters deep. In the tanker's  wake followed a hydrographic vessel, which failed to discover  any levels in excess of normal background radiation. Therefore  it is frivolous to say that ecological damage was done to  anyone. A few days ago Japan officially acknowledged that.  Japan's discharges of industrial waste into the Sea of Japan do  the environment incomparably greater harm. There is no way to  describe the uproar over the Russian liquid radioactive waste as  anything but hysteria. However, that in no way means that  efforts should not be made to find a solution to the radioactive  waste problem. A report has already been prepared on a whole  range of pertinent issues. In the near future it will be  presented to the government and to countries that have expressed  a desire to provide Russia with technical and financial  assistance with its radioactive waste processing. Those are the  United States, Canada, Norway, Holland, Japan and South Korea.  Relying on our own efforts alone, the earliest we could end  dumping of radioactive wastes at sea would be after the end of  1995.    Bayduzhiy: Each day Russia experiences two  accidents on oil and gas pipelines, it has one train wreck a  week, and it has a major industrial accident once a month. Do  you have the impression that we are on the verge of another  Chernobyl?    Danilov-Danilyan: Actually, no, though to make any  promises like that would be the purest foolhardiness -- anything  is possible. However, the most dangerous industries, those where  a disaster could have the most serious consequences, are closely  monitored by us. Nuclear power plant operations have become much  more orderly. Even the International Atomic Energy Agency just  recently, to my great surprise, acknowledged that Chernobyl-type  reactors, the RBMK, may continue to be operated, i.e. that they  do not significantly deviate from international safety  standards. That also came as a surprise to many technical  specialists.    Bayduzhiy: But in addition to nuclear power  facilities we also have at least as many hazardous facilities in  the chemical and metals industries...    Danilov-Danilyan: Yes, these are indeed extremely  hazardous things. For example, chemical plants in Dzerzhinsk, or  Aramas-16, also located in Nizhegorod Oblast, where nuclear  warheads are being disassembled under conditions that are, quite  frankly, not 100 percent adequate. There are plenty of problems,  but I want to reiterate that the most dangerous areas are being  monitored with particular vigilance by the Russian agencies for  the oversight of atomic and industrial safety and our own  agencies. In contrast to 1986, when the Chernobyl disaster  occurred under circumstances of completely idiotic complacency,  now we are already on our guard.    Bayduzhiy: What is your assessment of the current  ``green'' movement in this country?    Danilov-Danilyan: It is extremely weak and  divided. Often there are several groups active in each local  area, competing with one another, and each of them taken  individually is very insignificant. I would say that the most  solid environmental organization is the Volga parliament called  ``Revival of the Volga'' [Vozrozhdeniye Volgi]. But once again,  the committee to save the Rhine in Germany was much stronger at  the time when the Rhine was in the same condition that the Volga  is today. Therefore this is all relative. It is very regrettable  that many ``green'' groups and movements actually have purely  commercial objectives, attempting to use environmental slogans  as a means of attracting sponsor aid from abroad. Worse, for  some of them this has become something of a lifestyle. A  significant number of environmental groups are also notable for  their very nihilistic attitude toward the law. The classic  example of that is Greenpeace, which has chosen provocation of  the authorities as its method of action. It is deliberately  oriented toward confrontation. That organization often chooses  its priorities very incorrectly, making a big deal out of  insignificant events while overlooking real environmental  damage. Aleksey Yablokov, the president's advisor on  environmental affairs, recently put forward the idea that  environmental goals are not the only reason behind that, and  that Greenpeace's funding does not just come from members'  contributions. I became convinced of that a long time ago.  Greenpeace is backed by the very specific economic interests of  structures that are not at all difficult to discern if one takes  a close look at its activities.    Bayduzhiy: Some experts, among them the  aforementioned Aleksey Yablokov, feel that the ministry you head  has not proven able to withstand the bureaucratic pressure  exerted on it by various other ministries and agencies. One  example cited is that the Ministry of Environmental Protection  and Natural Resources expressed support for a nuclear power  development program without requiring an environmental impact  assessment...    Danilov-Danilyan: Those who are of that opinion  would like for the Ministry of Environmental Protection and  Natural Resources to behave the same way the ``greens'' do at  their rallies. We are a state organ and must operate in  accordance with existing laws, whether those laws be good or  bad. The ministry may take the initiative in regard to changing  a law, but under no circumstances may it violate the law. We  cannot demand that nuclear power stations be shut down and  atomic industry be eliminated merely because they are atomic. If  you will take a look at the minutes of that same government  session which considered the aforementioned program, you will  see that it was I and I alone who insisted that the decision  include a requirement that environmental impact assessments be  done on future projects. I regard as unacceptable the position  of complete rejection of this program as taken by Mr.  Yablokov--each year we have dozens of disasters in rail  transportation, so why not shut down the railroads as well?  Another problem lies in the fact that, as I have noted, under  the law not every document may be subjected to environmental  impact assessment, and a government decree is one such document.  This decree does not contain any specific projects that experts  could study from an ecological standpoint. Technical oversight  of nuclear power plants comes under the jurisdiction of Russian  Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety, which has  been very active of late. Funding for this decree was not  released, only envisioned -- in the event of a positive  environmental impact statement.    Bayduzhiy: But have there been cases in which you  have had to give in and make concessions? In other words, have  you lost the fight with various ministries and agencies?    Danilov-Danilyan: There has not been a single  fundamental issue on which either I or the Ministry of  Environmental Protection and Natural Resources have yet suffered  a defeat. Yes, there have been difficult situations, but we have  managed to defend successfully all the most important points  upon which the environmental protection system in Russia is  currently based.    Bayduzhiy: What is the future of the  ``Komsomolets?''    Danilov-Danilyan: A plan has been created to  render the submarine harmless there on the sea floor. That plan  will soon be submitted for environmental impact assessment, and  the assessment will be a serious one. We currently have two  forms of environmental assessment -- single-stage and two-stage.  In the former case all that is needed is a finding by a  commission of experts. In the latter case, when a project is  particularly complex and ambiguous, as was the case with the  Northern Heat and Electric Power Station, for example, the plan  is also reviewed by the Council for State Environmental  Assessment. So before anything is done with the ``Komsomolets''  each step will be strictly checked out and planned out.    Bayduzhiy: You were elected to the State Duma on  the Russia's Choice slate of candidates. Why exactly did you  choose that association and not, for instance, Cedar, which has  made environmental demands the core of its platform?    Danilov-Danilyan: My economic views coincide with  the concept of Russia's Choice, which has also expressed an  interest in developing its own strong environmental platform,  and I decided that there would be something for me to do in that  bloc... In my opinion the accusations of conflict of interest  that people are so fond of repeating will not stand up to  criticism. In a majority of developed countries it is the rule  rather than the exception for ministers to also serve as  deputies in parliament. Due to the nature of my job I have to  meet with many heads of foreign environmental protection  agencies. For instance, in the FRG, the Netherlands, Denmark,  Norway, France, Finland and Italy (where there have been four  different ministers of environmental protection in the past two  years) the ministers of environmental protection are all members  of parliament. That is quite logical: ministers, even ministers  of environmental protection, are political figures, and when one  of them does not get into parliament that is seen as a scandal.  As for Cedar, according to my observations the backbone of that  movement is comprised of businessmen who have adopted  environmental slogans just to win seats in the Duma. I could  only find one respected ecologist in their entire slate of  candidates. It is not surprising that in the acronym for Cedar  [Kedr] the word ``ecology'' [ekologiya] was transformed into  ``yekologiya.''    Bayduzhiy: Which current environmental issue do  you regard as the most important to Russia?    Danilov-Danilyan: The prevailing opinion that our  present sad environmental state is due to Russia's economic  problems is only partially correct. Paradoxical as it may seem,  our main environmental problems are still beyond the grasp of  our public consciousness. The birth of a single child in a  post-industrial country creates an environmental burden 300  times greater than the birth of a child in a developing country.  When asked when India could equal Great Britain's level, Mahatma  Gandhi replied: ``In order to achieve its prosperity Britain has  consumed the resources of half the planet. How many planets  would it take for a country like India to achieve that level?''  And so the main environmental issue is human beings'  reassessment of the entire system of values by which they live.  And that it is not a timely issue for Russia alone.</p>

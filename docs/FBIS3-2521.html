			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng today emphasized the importance of reforming and developing  undertakings for science and technology, education and culture.    Delivering a government work report to the Second Session of  the Eighth National People's Congress here today, Li Peng said  that while closely integrating science and technology with the  economy, this year it is imperative to fully enforce the  scientific and technological advances law and increase  investment in this field, make a success of the areas that set  aside for developing industries that use high and new  technologies, and turn research results into commercial products  as soon as possible.    "We should energetically support researches on both basic  and  applied sciences and researches on high and new technologies,  and encourage institutes of science and technology to associate  with enterprises," Li said.    "In our effort to develop science and technology and apply  research results, we should focus on equipping all sectors of  the economy with advanced technologies. In particular, we  should address such urgent problems as developing a highly  efficient agriculture that provides greater and better yields,  updating enterprises, converting defense industries to civilian  production, and assimilating and improving upon advanced  technologies from abroad," he added.    Great efforts should be made to foster markets for  technology, to set up intermediate organizations for  technological development and to protect intellectual property  rights.    In researches on basic science and on high and new  technologies, this year the country will select a number of key  projects that can exert a far-reaching influence on advances in  the next century and organize people to undertake them. The  State Council has decided to establish the Chinese Academy of  Engineering.    On educational reform, the premier said that emphasis should  be placed on adjusting the educational structure, improving  instruction and raising the overall efficiency of schools.    An important task that must be successfully accomplished in  the 1990s is to make nine-year compulsory education universal  and to eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people.    Li Peng also elaborated on primary and secondary education,  vocational education, adult education and higher education.    In his report, the premier reiterated that continued efforts  should be made to improve the working and living conditions of  intellectuals, to train and employ young and middle-aged  intellectuals and to implement the policy of permitting people  to study abroad, encouraging them to return home and allowing  them to come and go freely, and encouraging capable Chinese  living abroad to serve the motherland in various ways.    Speaking on development of cultural undertakings, Li Peng  said that more attention should be paid to the social benefits  and consequences of cultural products than to their economic  returns.    "We should tighten control over markets for cultural  products, in accordance with the law, and provide them with  varied and healthy cultural products," Li said.    Li emphasized that throughout the whole process of reform,  the opening up and the modernization drive, it is necessary to  give equal importance to economic development and development of  socialist culture and ideology.    In his report the premier also stressed the promotion of  public health and sports.</p>

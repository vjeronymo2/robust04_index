			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 17 KYODO -- Chinese public security  departments released former student leader Wang Dan and a crew  of U.S. television journalists Tuesday [17 May] after detaining  them for about an hour.    "They wanted to know what the interview was about and why I  was being interviewed. It was nothing," Wang told KYODO NEWS  SERVICE by phone.    According to Lucky Severson of U.S. National Broadcasting  Corp. (NBC), the five-man crew has been at Wang's residence for  about an hour before police arrived and took them all away.    "We were essentially finished with the interview and were  just getting shots of the residence when they came," he said.    The passports, residence permits and videotapes of the crew  were all taken by police and have not yet been returned, he said.    "Wang Dan talked about the status of human rights in China  and MFN (most-favored-nation trading status)," Severson said,  saying he felt Wang did not say anything that would bring him  trouble.    U.S. President Bill Clinton must decide by June 3 if China  has made enough progress in human rights areas to warrant the  renewal of MFN. Billions of dollars in bilateral trade are at  stake.    Severson said Wang, who was interrogated separately from the  NBC crew, was "cautious" during the interview.    He said none of his crew, composed of several nationalities,  was threatened or beaten by police.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Excerpt] Moscow, 6 Apr -- Yuriy Meshkov, president of the  Republic of Crimea, returned to Simferopol from a business trip  to Cyrpus nearly eight hours late. An ITAR-TASS correspondent  has been told by a member of staff on duty at Yuriy Meshkov's  office that the delay occurred when Turkey, over whose territory  the Crimean president's plane was due to fly, unexpectedly  closed its airspace. As a result of the incident, which the  member of staff believes to have been caused by a  "misunderstanding," the plane landed in Simferopol at about  0200. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool At sales in Australia this week, prices have continued to move into higher ground. The market indicator has moved more slowly, but advances have been recorded daily, with 533 cents a kg reached yesterday. Wool sold strongly at higher prices in New Zealand and South Africa last week, and at a Bradford sale of British wool. The British sector is important to the combing industry as well as trading as merchanted wool, and sterling devaluation made prices competitive on a world basis, but market improvement has only just been evident but trade assessments are cautious.</p>

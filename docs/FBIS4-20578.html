			<p>Boron   2p Electron Density of States of Various Boron  Compounds and Their Comparison With K-V X-Ray Emission Spectra   <F P=102> 43070061I Tokyo ISBB'93 in English Aug 93 p 48--FOR OFFICIAL  USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 43070061I </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo ISBB'93 </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO   <F P=106> [English abstract of article by Jun Kawai, Masayoshi </F> Kobayashi, and lwami Higashi, Institute of Physical and Chemical  Research (RIKEN); Yasuji Muramatsu, NTT Interdisciplinary  Research Laboratories; and Hirohiko Adachi, Department of  Metallurgy, Kyoto University]    [Text] The K-V (K_a_) X-ray emission  (fluorescence) spectra are emitted by the electric dipole  transition of an electron from 2p to 1s  orbital after the photoionization of one of the 1s  electron (V denotes valence hole state). The  2p orbitals of boron, carbon, nitrogen, and fluorine  form valence molecular orbitals (i.e., a valence band) in the  compounds. Therefore the K-V X-ray line shapes  represent the local (X-ray emitting atom) and partial  (2p) electron density of states (DOS) of the  compounds. The discrete-variational (DV) Hartree-Fock-Slater  (X_a_) calculations of carbon 2p DOS of  various carbon compounds have successfully reproduced the  measured carbon K-V X-ray line shapes of benzene,  C[.sub]60[/],[.sup]1[/] C[.sub]70[/],[.sup]2[/]  graphite, and diamond.[.sup]3[/] We then extend these  calculations to various boron compounds in the present paper.  The boron 2p DOS of various boron compounds (B,  B[.sub]4[/]C, BN, B[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/],  B[.sub]6[/]O, BF[.sub]3[/], ...) are calculated by the  DV-X_a_ method with a cluster-molecule approximation,  where, e.g., B[.sub]12[/] molecule is calculated in place of  a solid boron. The calculated B 2p DOS is compared  with the measured X-ray emission spectra in the literature,  resulting in satisfactory agreement between the calculation and  the experiment.  References    1. J.

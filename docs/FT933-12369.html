			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Southend Property setback PROFITS of Southend Property fell from Pounds 3.71m to Pounds 1.15m pre-tax for the year to March 31. A fall in turnover from Pounds 81.1m to Pounds 31.75m reflected disposals of property and non-property interests. During the year the group's property investments continued to produce growth in rental income but, reflecting the falls in property values, fully diluted net assets per share declined by 16p to 100p. As announced in the recent open offer document, the final dividend is to be held at 2.73p making a 4.25p (4.18p) total. Earnings per share fell to 0.1p (2.6p). With 'evidence emerging of a recovery in the property market' the group has exchanged contracts to acquire a 'large' town centre commercial estate in Liverpool for Pounds 5m in conjunction with Haigside and Western Securities. Southend will have a 50 per cent equity interest in the joint venture.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: India tries to realise its food export dream - Stefan Wagstyl reports on a switch to a more outward-looking agricultural policy INDIAN GOVERNMENTS have long dreamt of turning the fertile fields of the Punjab, in northern India, into an important source of export earnings. The soil, water, and the weather are well-suited to the large-scale production of cash crops and Punjabi farmers are among the most industrious in India. The state is the largest contributor to the country's national food stockpile. And yet, Punjab's and India's food exports are minuscule. The country, the world's second largest producer of fruit and vegetables and a leading grower of grains, exports less than 1 per cent of its output. The reformist government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, now wants to transform Indian agriculture. Earlier this year, it announced new policies to promote agricultural exports with a view to increasing them from USDollars 2.5bn in the year to March 1993 to Dollars 5bn-6bn in 1996-97. The figure excludes tea and other traditional plantation crops such as coconuts, but it includes fruit and vegetables, meat, grains, sugar and fish-farm products. Mr Pranab Mukherjee, the commerce minister, believes the policy changes will stimulate rapid growth in agricultural exports because investments in agriculture brought quick results. 'It will not take much time,' he says. Punjabi businessmen think, however, that the government's target will be hard to meet. They argue that it could be difficult to persuade farmers to improve the quality of the crops to make them fit for export. Also, India lacks the storage and transport facilities needed to deliver produce to foreign markets. Mr Rohit Khanna, a consultant at Nijjer Agro Foods, one of India's largest food processing companies, says the potential of Indian agriculture is 'unbelievable' but it could take 20 years for it to be fulfilled. Moreover, businessmen say India cannot produce farm goods of international quality without support from foreign food processing groups as only they can provide the necessary seeds and technology. As Mr Khanna says: 'Without prior experience it is impossible to develop a solid food processing industry. Otherwise large Indian industrial groups would have moved into agriculture long ago.' The government's main concession is to permit businessmen to import machinery and raw materials such as seeds duty-free for use in export-oriented farms or food processing plants. Given that Indian import duties are among the world's highest, this will greatly reduce the cost of investing in modern equipment. Moreover, export-oriented units will be obliged to export only 50 per cent of their output, leaving the rest for sale in the Indian market. At the same time, the government is easing a host of controls regulating the flow of food supplies in India - including export restrictions on sugar, grains, oils and other crops. The controversial reforms represent a significant departure from post-independence agricultural policy, a central plank of which has been restraint of exports to keep down domestic food prices and reduce the risk of famine. Mr Mukherjee says the new export-oriented policy will not hurt domestic consumers because total output is rising and will increase further with the new techniques that export-oriented producers will introduce. However, many businessmen doubt whether the country's agricultural sector can bring results as fast as the government expects. They point to shortages of adequate cold storage warehouses, food processing plants and refrigerated lorries. India processes less than 1.5 per cent of its fruit and vegetables, compared with 80 per cent in the US and 70 per cent in Brazil, the world's largest fruit growers. Educating farmers to produce exportable crops takes longer than might be expected. Often Indian seeds need replacing with new varieties bred for their resistance to disease. Sometimes such seeds can be imported; sometimes imported seeds must be adapted for Indian conditions - a time-consuming laboratory job. Similarly, modern watering technologies - such as drip-feeding techniques developed in the US, Israel and elsewhere - may be ideal for Indian conditions. But more often than not they need some alterations. For example, drip-feed systems can carry fertiliser as well as water to crops - but fertiliser powders can clog the pipework if they are wrongly prepared. Unless farmers produce crops of the right quality, investments further along the food processing pipeline will be worthless. As Mr Khanna of Nijjer says: 'The key to food processing is good links with the farmers'. Nijjer itself has grown from a tomato farm run in the Punjab by Mr Wasant Singh Nijjer, who travelled to the US in the 1960s and brought back modern techniques and high-quality American seeds. After supplying other processors for over 30 years, Nijjer started processing tomatoes into paste itself in 1991. This year it plans to export half its 5,000-tonne output and earn about Rs300m ((Pounds 6m) in foreign exchange. Perhaps, the best way for foreign companies to create such ties with local farmers is through joint ventures. For example, Nijjer's main rival in Punjab is a joint venture involving Pepsi, the US food and drinks company and owner of India's largest tomato paste factory. Other foreign companies that have invested in food processing include Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch combine, which this year bought control of Kissan Products, a South Indian maker of ketchup and food pulp. An executive at one foreign food processing company says most multinationals are likely to invest cautiously in Indian agriculture and food processing. In almost every country, agriculture is prone to political interference, he says. Foreign companies have to be particularly careful about not raising nationalist's hackles. However, there are opportunities in India for investing in downstream processing. India can be a good source of supply, especially for the fast-growing markets of east Asia, says the executive.</p>

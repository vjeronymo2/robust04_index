			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of speech by Chamber of Deputies President Frantz </F> Robert Monde on 13 April; place not given -- recorded]    [Text] Haitian sisters, Haitian brothers: Our country is  undoubtedly experiencing the most difficult moment of its  history. Today, as has happened several times since our  independence, we find ourselves alone, undergoing a severe,  pitiless, and murderous universal quarantine. We cannot help  remembering that it was also like that during the first half  century of the existence of a dearly won independence, because  we are alone. We are duty-bound to gather the scattered pieces  of a torn nation for which nothing has ever been easy and in  which nobody has ever been spared. It is at such moments that  the men and women of this nation have always found the sense of  compromise, of realism, and of the proud vision characteristic  of our will to live together.    Haitian sisters, Haitian brothers, I make a point of  addressing every one of you today because it is really necessary  that a legitimate authority of this nation do so. This kind of  dialogue is essential, especially in these difficult moments and  because the ultimate resort is you. As for us, we are only your  representatives. It is you who elected us. We must give you  explanations, not only at the end of our respective mandates,  but also and especially at this very important watershed and in  view of the particularly perilous choices vis-a-vis our  continuing existence as a sovereign nation. I address you today  as president of the Chamber of Deputies and vice president of  the National Assembly. The National Assembly constitutes the  legislative power and is the joint securer of the national  sovereignty.    In view of the extended absences of a president of the  Republic and a prime minister; in view of the endless division  prevailing within the Senate, it is my duty to talk to you about  the peril that today threatens our existence as a sovereign  people.    This peril is all the greater because our days are numbered.  Between now and 9 May, the parliament must close the seventh  session of the 45th Legislature and ensure the opening on 13 May  of its eighth and final session. We must meet these  constitutional requirements. It would be irresponsible on our  part to mortgage the existence of an institution which  represents today one of the last ramparts of our fragile and  imperfect democracy.    This peril is all the greater because the Dominican  presidential elections scheduled for 15 May look tumultuous. It  has become even more essential that Haitian society be governed.    This peril is all the greater because new elections aimed at  renewing one-third of the Senate and the totality of the  deputies and communal elected representatives are due to be held  within only seven months.    Haitian sisters, Haitian brothers, since the beginning of  the  existence of our nation, we have experienced long periods of  misgovernment; but for the first time, we have found ourselves  -- since the resignation of Prime Minister Robert Malval, which  has been accepted by the president of the Republic -- facing a  complete absence of the executive. A resigning government can be  in charge of dealing with day-to-day business, insofar as a date  is set for its replacement. How can it deal indefinitely with  day-to-day business when the higher authority from whom it comes  does not seem to be overly affected by the incongruity of this  situation?    Governing does not consist of dealing with day-to-day  business. Governing is, first and foremost and especially,  foreseeing, preparing, and facing the great collective  rendezvous provided for by our laws and customs and especially  by our fundamental law, the Constitution. It is not just a  matter of the legitimate authorities' organizing great masses to  celebrate the anniversaries of our Constitution. The sole  responsible attitude consists first of doing what the  Constitution orders done at the proper time and place.    For exactly five months, our country has had no government.  The division that can be observed within the Senate, the Supreme  Audit Court, and the administrative litigation cannot leave any  citizen indifferent. One might say that they are autonomous  entities that must be able to conduct themselves as grown-ups.  But life also teaches us that no entity, no organization is safe  from open conflict. It is therefore important that a supreme  authority be concerned about using all powers of persuasion  available to achieve an inevitable compromise.    This moral and legitimate supreme authority exists. It is  the  president of the Republic. He has the duty to be concerned with  the smooth running of all the institutions and to intervene in a  noncoercive way. Should the nonfunctioning of all these  fundamental institutions not interfere with the sleep of a  responsible president of the Republic? Should the absence of a  prime minister and of a government not interfere with the sleep  of of the president of the Republic? The president of the  Republic has attached a number of conditions to the choice of a  prime minister. Even our mother law does not set any particular  conditions. The only stipulation to the spirit and the letter  of the Constitution is that following acceptance of the prime  minister's resignation, the president of the Republic, in  consultation with the presidents of the two chambers, must fill  the governmental vacuum. It is in this spirit that the  parliamentary plan, inspired from the international conference  in Miami convened by President Aristide, was developed and  presented to the president of the Republic.    As president of the Chamber of Deputies and vice president  of  the National Assembly, I am assuming my right to observe that  President Aristide obstinately refuses to fill this  institutional vacuum. This vacuum does not prevent him from  sleeping or from traveling around the world. On the other hand,  it is comforting to find that some political formations, some  socioprofessional organizations, groups of citizens from all  social categories are becoming alarmed by the persistence of  this dangerous vacuum. I am therefore taking this opportunity to  pay tribute to all those who, in the face of this established  fact, concerted themselves democratically to address their  resolution or their petition to the legislative power. Our  country needs and will increasingly need those conscious  patriots who are closely following the evolution of public  affairs. However, a large vision of this crisis commands us to  clearly and firmly express our disagreement with some ways and  means of filling this vacuum. We said it and are repeating it  today: Our country committed itself, with the adoption of the  1987 Constitution, to building a state of law and institutional  democracy. The permanence of the organs provided by this  Constitution concerns all of us.    Just because President Jean-Bertrand Aristide persists in  ignoring the spirit and letter of this Constitution does not  mean that we should follow him and do the same. This is why we  understand the meaning and impact of the latest resolution voted  by an assembly of senators gathered at the initiative of the  Honorable Senator Bernard Sansaricq. We can only have  reservations about the crisis resolution option implied by this  resolution [as heard]. This option sweeps away with the back of  its hand the obvious, unavoidable fact that the political  Haitian crisis arising from circumstances has been  internationalized. We must accept the fact of this  internationalization. Like everything, it has both good and bad  sides. In the context of the globalization of events and  interdependence of nations, our job and our duty as political  officials consists of doing our best to maximize the good and  minimize the bad.    As this political crisis has been internationalized, we have  lost exclusive control and exclusive power to define the  resolution options and make them effectual. We must also reckon  with slowness, which is less the result of our crisis as such,  than of the Department of the Interior data and policy of such  and such a foreign concerned nation. Maximizing the good side  means to be always ready to hold constructive dialogue with our  foreign partners who bother to take honest steps to know our  reality and our culture. To minimize the negative is to again  refuse excessive interference and insincere gifts.    We have refused and will always refuse the crumbs of  humanitarian aid that France has deigned to throw at us like one  throws a bone to a dog. France wishes to maintain its prestige  in international politics. We can certainly understand that. But  why must France -- in the absence of a true policy toward our  country and our international conflict -- use our children's  hunger and our youths' distress as a pawn in international  politics? It is even worse: By what perverse twist can one  imagine that the people of Martinique are demanding French  military occupation of our country? Do those people from  Martinique have enough historic memory to remember the nobility  of the address of General Dessalines [Haitian national hero who  proclaimed Haiti's independence on 1 January 1804] to them in  1084?    We refuse and we will always refuse to believe in the good  faith of the leading light of the Black Caucus, who has found  nothing to propose but military occupation of our country. The  Haitian nation has a long history of exchange and solidarity  with black Americans. All our governments -- from Toussaint  Louverture [Haitian national hero who paved the way for  Dessalines] to Dessalines, and from [Jean-Pierre] Boyer  [president of Haiti from 1818 to 1843] to [Fabre Nicolas]  Geffrard [president of Haiti from 1859 to 1867] -- did their  best to bring constant support to the struggle for emancipation  of black Americans. But our governments and politicians never  tried to intervene in national U.S. political space. Our country  has scrupulously respected the pace of emancipation of black  Americans in their own national space. Why can they not be as  reserved with our internal struggles? Perhaps because they have  become rich while we have remained poor. Franz Fanon [a writer  from Martinique, author of the book, "Peau Noire, Masque Blanc"]  was right: Those people, unfortunately, are still black skins,  but with white masks.    For that reason, it is necessary today to continue, with  all our bona fide partners, to attempt to define as accurately  as possible the outlines of a realistic plan for a solution to  the political crisis arising from the present juncture, by  applying the necessary wisdom and pragmatism. The Governors  Island agreement constitutes a framework, a reference, and a  mechanism aimed at achieving an inter-Haitian dialogue between  Haiti and the international community. At the same time, within  the framework of our national space, we must take into account  the daily management of public affairs and the collective  appointments provided by our law.    I am convinced that it is possible for us to define a  consensual option for the safeguard of our republican  institutions. I am convinced that no Haitian citizen living in  Haiti can imagine that it is through further weakening of, if  not eliminating altogether, the current institutions that a  democratic and consensual solution to the peril threatening us  will be found.    A democratic solution necessarily implies reinforcement of  the state and of the institutions in charge of offering services  to the population. It necessarily implies disengagement of the  Haitian Armed Forces from their traditional tasks and methods.  The persistence of the institutional vacuum can only worsen an  atmosphere of insecurity and increase the already too great  number of violations of the fundamental rights of citizens.    Haitian sisters, Haitian brothers, the slowness that  characterizes the search for a solution to the political crisis  arising from the present juncture is crippling our country and  is wearing all of us out. It has become imperative for us that  we work on filling the current governmental vacuum and that we  ascertain the feasibility of the coming electoral deadlines.    The constraints inherent in the difficult period we are  facing force us to refuse any unilateral approach. That is why,  as the vice president of the National Assembly and president of  the Chamber of Deputies, enjoying the support of the majority of  deputies and strong with the bloc [not further identified] of  the Senate, I intend, beginning this week, to start a series of  consultations with all sectors of our collective life on two  points:    First of all, how to fill the current vacuum in the  executive  power, taking into account the deadlock that the parliamentary  plan is facing due to the stubborn refusal of President  Jean-Bertrand Aristide to appoint a prime minister.    Second, how to solve the upcoming problem of the expiration  of the mandates of the entire Chamber of Deputies, of a third of  the Senate, and of all the communal elected representatives.    We will neglect nothing so all sectors of our society can  be consulted. This means we will consult with the great bodies  of the state as well as the employers' and union associations,  the socioprofessional associations, the Episcopal Conference,  the Protestants, and the various political formations.    I would like -- in concluding this address -- to tell you  that I continue to believe that with the complexity and  incredible entanglement of our political crisis, there is no  royal path for anyone. I also remain convinced that reasonable  compromise solutions can be identified and applied. One might as  well say that we are duty bound to move toward the definition of  a political pact for the preservation of the institutional bases  of Haitian democracy. I want to take this opportunity to  solemnly call on you, Haitian sisters and brothers in general,  and all important and unavoidable actors in our crisis, in  particular. My call goes out to President Jean-Bertrand  Aristide. I ask him on your behalf to assume his  responsibilities toward the Constitution that he swore to  respect. My call goes out to Lieutenant General Raoul Cedras. I  ask him to refuse to listen to the perverse songs of the sirens  and to do what his duty and his word of honor as a soldier order  him to do.    Haitian sisters, Haitian brothers: I tell you of my  admiration. I tell you the Chamber of Deputies is going to do  what its duty orders it to do for you and for the well-being of  our nation. Thank you.</p>

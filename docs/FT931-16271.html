			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Technology: Ageing hydros get a new lease of life - Rehabilitating old power stations has become a thriving business The recent approval by the Ontario government of a CDollars 1.2bn (Pounds 600m), 20-year project to renovate 34 small hydro electric power stations in the Canadian province highlights the growing potential of retrofit programmes for old hydro plants. At a time when the construction of new hydro electric projects is being stalled throughout the world by environmental and financing problems, electric utilities are turning to renovation of old plants as a way to increase power output significantly and quickly without adding to environmental disturbance. There is hardly a single component in an old hydro station whose performance cannot be improved by a more efficient modern equivalent. Digital controls, for example, permit more efficient use of the water flow than old manual ones. Thanks to the recent development of computer-aided flow simulation technology, the biggest gains can now be obtained by designing new, optimised turbines to make maximum use of the available water. According to the Escher Wyss division of Sulzer, the Swiss engineering group, retrofitting newly designed turbines can yield increases of power generation capacity from an existing plant of between 15 and 20 per cent. If combined with redesigned and manufactured waterways and generator sets, the gains can be even larger. The benefits from good turbine design are of two types. First, the efficiency of the turbine itself can be improved. However, the potential there is relatively modest, the big gains having been made already. The efficiency of modern turbines is generally over 90 per cent compared with 75 per cent in 1900. The other, more important, benefit comes from designing the turbine so that the flow rate from the same head of water can be increased. The problem with high flow rates is that the differential in pressure between the two sides of the turbine blades rises and this accelerates erosion of the blades through a process known as cavitation (air bubbles imploding against the surface of the blade). Using computational fluid dynamics, it is possible to optimise the shape of the blades and water guides to minimise the erosion. Escher Wyss, one of the world's top three water turbine makers, claims a lead over its competitors in the lively retrofit sector because of the high level of sophistication of its computer simulation programmes, developed during the 1980s in co-operation with the University of Lausanne. The company says that its programmes work considerably faster than those of its competitors, so that it can carry out a flow analysis of a specific case in only a few hours. This means it can explore several alternative solutions over a period of a few weeks to find the most suitable one. 'The bottleneck today is the engineer's understanding, not the computer,' says Helmut Keck, head of research and development at the hydraulics division of Sulzer-Escher Wyss. The programmes have also become increasingly precise, with a recent addition even to simulate cavitation. The company is working on a programme that will simulate the whole turbine-generator complex. Keck says that, in cases of small turbines at least, there is no longer any need to go through the expensive and time-consuming step of building a scale model to verify the performance claims produced by its computer analysis. This means that the time from order to completed installation can be cut almost in half from about two years to one year. The company's first large-scale use of the technology was for the McCormick power station of Manicouagan Power in Canada's Quebec province. New turbines were designed to fit into the existing casing, and the computer simulation suggested an increase in output of about 14 per cent. A model test confirmed the indication, and the actual installation, which is just now taking place, appears to be confirming the projections. On the Ontario Hydro contract, Escher Wyss's Canadian subsidiary will make comprehensive proposals for rehabilitating 34 power stations throughout the province and supply what it calls water to wire electro-mechanical equipment packages for them. The value of its contract is about CDollars 350m. Christian Habegger, general manager of hydraulics at Sulzer-Escher Wyss headquarters in Zurich, says the retrofit business looks set to continue to grow, especially in industrialised countries where nuclear power plants have become unpopular. Habegger says the technology could also be helpful in eastern European countries where many hydro plants are in a poor state of repair and where utilities urgently need new sources of power so that they can shut down their dangerous nuclear plants.</p>

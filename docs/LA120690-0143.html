			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: A CUT ABOVE THE USUAL DINER FARE  </P> <P> Like hundreds of other '50s-style diners spawned during the past decade,  Lyndy's Restaurant is a good place to get a juicy burger, fries and a Coke,  along with a taste of nostalgia -- all for a fair price.  </P> <P> But unlike most other culinary shrines to Marilyn, Elvis and James Dean,  Lyndy's offers a menu replete with alternatives to the usual diner fare.  </P> <P> If you're not in a mood for a burger, hot dog or milkshake, and didn't get  enough of Thanksgiving dinner, Lyndy's dishes up a turkey-and-stuffing meal as  good as any. Turkey being a house specialty, it's served any time of year, in  the form of full dinners, sandwiches or pot pies -- and, of course, always with  the sounds of Chuck Berry and Fats Domino on the side.  </P> <P> Even if you walk in craving a burger with a slice of '50s flashback, be sure to  peruse the daily specials. The revolving menu offers a wonderfully diverse  selection of dishes, including red snapper, cabbage, enchiladas and potato  pancakes. One can even order steak, shrimp and barbecue pork chops -- all in  the same meal, and for less than $8.  </P> <P> This also may be the only '50s diner where one can get a good Irish beer. Both  Guinness stout and Harp ale (by the bottle) are always available.  </P> <P> The quirky diversity of Lyndy's menu is representative of the evolution of the  30-year-old adjunct eatery to the motel of the same name.  </P> <P> Before undergoing the nostalgia face lift several years ago, Lyndy's had been a  family restaurant/coffee shop, serving many of the items that appear as  specials today. With the '50s-style overmake came an expanded menu of burgers,  fries and shakes.  </P> <P> And the burgers, by the way, are excellent. They start at $2.50, and any  cheeseburger, bacon burger or other variation can be made a "Big Bopper" --  with another patty added -- for an extra $1.  </P> <P> Don't be fooled by the red-sparkled upholstery and '50s artifacts that adorn  the walls -- the atmosphere, refreshingly, is more relaxed and unpretentious  than trendy.  </P> <P>  Lyndy's Restaurant, 924 S. Beach Blvd. (at Ball Road), Anaheim. Open daily  from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. (714) 761-0234. JOHN PENNER  </P></p>

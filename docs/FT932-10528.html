			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Sealed border may turn out to be a sieve: Laura Silber casts doubt on President Milosevic's ability to police Serbia's frontier with Bosnia BY SNUBBING their former patron, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Bosnia's Serb leaders did him a favour. Mr Milosevic now has the blessing of the international community to either rein in the Bosnian Serbs or let them bear responsibility for the war. But whether Mr Milosevic will be willing or able to prevent supplies of arms and food getting through to the recalcitrant Bosnian Serbs remains open to doubt. Many believe the Serbian border with Bosnia will be impossible to seal, ending up a sieve beyond his control. The rejection by the Bosnian Serb assembly of the Vance-Owen plan, which Mr Milosevic says he supports, appears to have exposed a deep rift between Belgrade and Pale, the Bosnian Serb mountain stronghold. Dismissing Mr Milosevic's attempts to persuade the self-styled parliament to accept the plan, Bosnian Serb deputies voted to hold a referendum on the plan to divide Bosnia into ten semi-autonomous ethnic provinces. After their Bosnian kin had rejected the peace plan, Serbian and Yugoslav federal authorities swiftly responded with the announcement that they were cutting off all supplies except food and medicine to Serb-held territory in Bosnia. It is too early to tell whether Belgrade will carry out the threat. If successfully implemented, it could cripple the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb state, already devastated by a year of war. The rump Yugoslavia, comprised of Serbia and Montenegro, has earmarked 20 per cent of its national income for Bosnian Serbs over the past year. The UN last week imposed more sanctions on Yugoslavia when Bosnian Serbs rejected the peace plan. Eleven months of a trade embargo have hit the federation hard. But the borders are porous and there is little sign that international monitors will be deployed to the many bridges leading to Bosnia-Hercegovina. 'There are 100 border places. In many places it is like a sieve,' said a western diplomat. Serbian police have reportedly stepped up controls searching cars on the many border crossings where until Sunday most people passed, just flashing their identity cards. 'Everything except humanitarian food and medicines will have to stop going across,' said a trade inspector from Belgrade, Danilo Hajduk-Veljkovic. But so far the reality has been different. Yugoslav security forces at a road block on a bridge at Mali Zvornik said they had not yet been given new orders to apply the strict embargo announced on Thursday by Serbia against their Bosnian kin. Border traffic is still rumbling back and forth across the Drina river bridges on the frontier. Serbs from both sides of the Drina said closing the border would be a betrayal by President Milosevic but almost all of them scoffed at the idea that the cut-off in supplies could work. Bragging that Bosnian Serbs did not need weapons supplied from Serbia, one Bosnian Serb soldier said: 'You guys have got it all wrong. We've got enough of our own guns.' The blockade nevertheless is the strongest sign so far that Mr Milosevic may have turned on the leaders he cultivated and modelled in his own image. By imposing a blockade Serbia has publicly stated it is no longer willing to make sacrifices for its ungrateful allies. Mr Milosevic, if he is sincere about abandoning his nationalist mantle, must now turn against his unofficial ally, Mr Vojislav Seselj, leader of the Serbian Radical party and commander of a paramilitary unit. Mr Seselj, whom Mr Milosevic once called his favourite politician, has called for the expulsion of all non-Serbs from Serbia as well as 'politically suspect' Serbs. He has also been named by the US state Department as a possible war criminal. Another relationship Mr Milosevic will have to confront is with General Ratko Mladic, widely credited with having swayed the parliament to reject the Vance-Owen plan this week. General Mladic has the reputation as 'a soldier's soldier' and single-handedly orchestrated the Bosnian-Serb campaign. Just before the war erupted, Mr Milosevic appointed General Mladic as army commander of Yugoslav forces in Sarajevo. For the first time, Mr Milosevic, who built his career on a faux-populism, scoffed at the idea of 'letting the people decide their own future' when the Bosnian Serbs voted to hold a referendum. In a sign that Serbia was ready to condemn actions by the Bosnian Serbs, the media in Belgrade yesterday gave extensive and critical coverage of the bombing and destruction of three mosques in Banja Luka, the bastion of Serb radicalism in northwestern Bosnia. Attacks on Moslem relics and mosques have been tolerated or ignored in state-controlled media since war broke out 13 months ago. When mosques in March were blown up in the northeastern town of Bijelina, which was mostly Serbian before the war, Television Serbia, under the control of Mr Milosevic, did not mention the incident. Bosnian Serb leaders so far have not shown much anger or surprise at Belgrade's decision to impose sanctions. Hardliners said the move was 'understandable in the face of intense international pressure. 'This is very sad. But we don't need anything from them except food and some trade. We can survive as we survived for four years against Hitler without receiving anything from abroad,' said Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.</p>

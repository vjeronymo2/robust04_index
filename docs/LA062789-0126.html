			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWPORTER RESORT WILL BECOME A HYATT, UNDERGO RENOVATION  </P> <P> The Newporter Resort near Fashion Island in Newport Beach will become the Hyatt  Newporter next month, the hotel chain said Monday.  </P> <P> Hyatt Hotels Corp. was one of the last major chains without a hotel to manage  in the booming Costa Mesa/Newport Beach/Irvine area around John Wayne Airport.  </P> <P> Hyatt will replace Westgroup, a Los Angeles hotel management company, on July  16.  </P> <P> The hotel's owner, Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn. in Beverly Hills, said it  would spend more than $4 million over the next three years to refurbish the  hotel.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the thrift said it switched to Hyatt because of the chain's  "very strong national recognition."  </P> <P> Columbia may also have considered Hyatt's marketing expertise, hotel experts  said, especially in attracting business meetings to Hyatt hotels. Local  competition for the lucrative meetings business is intense.  </P> <P> The 410-room Newporter -- at 1107 Jamboree Road -- once had little competition  in the local hotel market: Built in 1962 as a resort, for much of the 1960s it  was the only upscale hotel in the Newport Beach area.  </P> <P> But by the time Columbia bought it for $26 million in 1985, the hotel had been  sold several times and business had been falling off, Westgroup said in 1985 as  it took over management of the hotel for Columbia.  </P> <P> The competition has only gotten stiffer since: In the last five years, the  Newporter has had to square off against a pair of new oceanfront resorts: the  Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point and the Dana Point Resort.  </P> <P> And developers have built a number of hotels for business travelers among the  mid-rise office buildings in the Newport Beach/Costa Mesa/Irvine area. One  reason: An adjacent hotel makes these developer's office buildings more  attractive to tenants.  </P> <P> So intense is the competition for guests in those cities now that some surveys  put the average hotel occupancy rate in the range of 65%, a little better than  last year, but not much.  </P> <P> "It's going to take another year or two to get healthier," said Jim Burba, a  consultant at accounting firm Pannell Kerr Forster's Newport Beach office.  </P> <P> With those kinds of numbers, it's unlikely that many new hotels will be built  soon near the airport, experts say. Only one big hotel opened in the area last  year; only one will open this year. Both are Marriott all-suite hotels. For  Hyatt, that's one advantage of operating the Newporter: The chain can get a  foothold in the market without waiting for a developer to build a new hotel.  </P> <P> Experts say developers planning new hotels in the area are probably also  courting Hyatt, which has a reputation as one of the nation's better hotel  chains. Some of them may yet get their wish: Once the latest wave of new hotels  is filled up, the experts said, the airport market will probably be busy enough  to accommodate another Hyatt.  </P> <P> Over the years the chain has talked to some of the county's biggest developers  -- the Irvine Co., Koll Co., Mola Development Co. -- about managing their new  hotels.  </P> <P> But so far, Hyatt has moved at a deliberate pace in Orange County. The chain  operates only a hotel across the street from Disneyland in Anaheim and the  Hyatt Regency Alicante in Garden Grove, which Hyatt took over in 1987 from the  Princess hotel chain.  </P> <P> Altogether, Chicago-based Hyatt operates 23 hotels and resorts in California.  It began in the state in 1957 with a hotel at Los Angeles International  Airport.  </P> <P> The company says it remains interested in possible new opportunities in Orange  County. A spokesman noted that when Hyatt opened an office to scout new deals  on the West Coast about a year and a half ago, it put the office in Orange  County.  </P></p>

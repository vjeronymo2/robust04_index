			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: French insurer dragged down by Baltica stake GROUPE VICTOIRE, the French insurer, yesterday announced an 88 per cent plunge in net profits to FFr214m (Dollars 39.6m) last year from FFr1.8bn in 1991. It was dragged down by its stake in Baltica, the troubled Danish insurance company. Mr Gerard Worms, chairman of Victoire as well as of the Suez group to which the insurance company is linked, forecast that 'the 1993 profit will be clearly above that of 1992, but not at the level of 1991'. Baltica, in which Victoire has a 23.7 per cent stake, has hit problems in its property and banking activities, and it accounted for about FFr1bn of the French insurer's loss. Victoire has cut its dividend to FFr 6.5 a share from FFr 19.5 the year before. The Banque Francaise du Commerce Exterieur, specialist in trade and investment credits, yesterday announced a rise in net profit to FFr137m for last year, compared to FFr115m in 1991.</p>

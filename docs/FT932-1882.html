			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Management: Management (The Growing Business): Caught in the crossfire - Charles Batchelor looks at new export restrictions on machinery, in a continuing series on red tape THE Cardinal Broach Company, a manufacturer of specialist cutting tools, has spent the past few years building up exports. But in the wake of the Gulf war and the Matrix-Churchill 'super gun' affair, the government tightened up the rules on the export of machinery that could be used to make armaments. These tough new restrictions could undermine that hard-won business. The need to obtain approval for exports threatens to stretch delivery times from between six and eight weeks to 16 weeks and more, says Glyn Ridley, managing director of the Ratby, Leicestershire-based company. Two recent shipments to long-established customers were impounded by Customs &amp; Excise at Heathrow Airport on the grounds that export licences were needed under the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1992. 'I can't believe these regulations were designed to stop companies like ourselves,' says Ridley, who led a buy-out of Cardinal Broach from Brooke Tool Engineering last February. Cardinal Broach exports 20 per cent of its Pounds 5.5m turnover and employs 128 people in Ratby and Biggleswade. Most export orders won by Cardinal Broach are worth less than Pounds 5,000 - a large order might amount to Pounds 20,000 - so the paperwork involved in applying for licences every time would be a nightmare, comments Ridley. 'Our customers will buy from other European Community competitors who do not subject them to the need for extraneous documentation,' he warns. 'The essence of exporting is to make it as simple as possible for the customer to buy from you.' The problem for Cardinal Broach is that its tools, which fit on to machine tools to cut intricate forms in high volumes, can be used in a range of applications, from the food industry to small arms manufacture. It sells to 34 countries, many of them on the list of those covered by the legislation, and to companies in the fields of aircraft engine manufacture, vehicles, general engineering and armaments. Sales depend on providing a fast response to customer inquiries and a high level of service, says Ridley. The company responds to customer inquiries within two days and delivery is normally made within six to eight weeks. Under the new rules, Cardinal Broach must ask its customers to supply an end-use certificate, explaining what the tools will be used for, and then apply to the DTI for an export licence. Only when this has been granted can it start to manufacture the consignment. Coping with this delay would not pose serious problems on products such as machine tools, where there can be a lead time of several months. But on consumable cutting tools, which are used and then discarded, and where delivery times are very short, it can strangle business. 'The delay will effectively destroy all our previous work in developing these markets,' says Ridley, who has complained to Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. Cardinal Broach claims market leadership in the UK but faces tough competition from Germany, Italy, France, Spain, the US and the Far East. The two consignments held up at Heathrow are destined for projects where the main supplier, one UK and the other German, have already obtained export approval, says Ridley . He suggests that a solution would be to grant long-term export approvals for particular projects which would avoid suppliers having to re-apply for permission for each shipment. 'We have developed overseas markets in recent years, often at quite considerable financial cost,' Ridley comments. 'We were happy to take this expense on board, thinking they would result in a stronger company with a wider customer base. I can't believe the legislation was designed to catch companies like us.' The Department of Trade and Industry said that it could provide initial guidance to exporters on whether controls apply in particular countries. Once an order has been obtained, the more information the exporter can provide the more quickly the case can be considered. If a company obtains repeat orders it may not need to apply for an export licence each time, the DTI said.

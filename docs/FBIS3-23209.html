			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Agents from the Prosecutor General's Office and the  Bogota Metropolitan Police yesterday uncovered an ELN [Army of  National Liberation] plan to form a popular militia group in  southern Bogota to meddle in the business sector and spread  their ideological work.    Authorities raided a home in Las Delicias neighborhood where  they reportedly found several pamphlets urging cooperation with  the rebels and planning intimidation and extortion projects for  various area businessmen. Seemingly, the ELN militia in Bogota  would try to force people to contribute money, which would  guarantee their security. [no beginning quotation mark as  published] Three people were arrested in the operation, in  addition to the seizure of Venezuelan arms and ammunition, as  well as the pamphlets.    Authorities increased operations to try to break up the ELN  plan and at the same time guarantee the fulfillment of a  proposal by Ciudad Bolivar militias, who offered to demobilize  and get their members to rejoin civilian life the way militias  have been negotiating in Medellin.</p>

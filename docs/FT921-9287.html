			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / CIS may founder over split-up of centralised armed forces: Russia seems certain to set up its own army THE Commonwealth of Independent States, the successor to the Soviet Union, may founder tomorrow in Minsk - where it began a little more than two months ago. A formal announcement to that effect is unlikely: but another session of papering over the cracks is probably impossible. The root problem is army, the only surviving institution of the Soviet state but one whose future is increasingly uncertain as the individual republics, including Russia, opt for separate forces. Fears over the army's reaction to its disintegration as a unified force representing the CIS were highlighted yesterday when rumuors of a possible coup attempt against President Yeltsin swept some western stock markets. They emerged after Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister, said the economic crisis and tensions in the armed forces could lead to a coup in Moscow. Such tensions are likely to persist, in part because in the past week, a succession of statements by the senior military advisors around the Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, made it clear that they expected the announcement of the creation of separate Russian armed forces immediately after the Minsk summit. Yesterday officials in Moscow said the decree was likely to be promulgated at the weekend - and that it would envisage an armed force totalling 1.5m men, becoming a professional force in the course of the next few years. In an interview with the Financial Times yesterday, Col Alexei Tsaryov, chairman of the defence sub committee of the Russian parliament, said that a resolution along these lines could be submitted to the parliament today after authoritative opinion shifted during the past week in favour of a Russian force. He warned, however, that the move would run into severe opposition from the armed forces general staff, headed by Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov. The general staff has prepared 14 documents calling for a unified command for the Commonwealth armed forces, with provision for a council of defence ministers to supervise it. A working group from the Commonwealth states has over the past two days been discussing these documents in Minsk in preparation for tomorrow's summit. 'Their conception is for practically unlimited power for the general staff. There is no place in it for the parliaments of the states. This is completely unacceptable to us, and it will be to other republics. The defence committee will propose that the statement on Russian armed forces should include the following: Russia will create its own defence capability; Other states should then decide what association they wish to have with the Russian forces, especially with the nuclear forces which Russia plans to monopolise An interparliamentary commission will be formed to thrash out the share-out. The latter point is likely to be contentious. The Ukrainian government fears that the Russians will use the requirement of the treaty on conventional forces reduction in Europe - due to be ratified within the next two months - to insist that it gets the lion's share of conventional weapons. At present, Ukraine has the bulk of the Commonwealth tank forces on its territory, and has claimed control over them. Russian military strategists, however, are calling for a redistribution of the forces based on the size of the republics - thus giving Russia the majority of the equipment. The disupte between Russia and the Ukraine over the Black Sea Fleet, by contrast, may be less contentious - since the indications from Ukraine are that the government may be content to take a small part of the fleet on condition that the status of the Crimea, once part of Russia and now a district of Ukraine, will not be disputed. Coll Tsaryov said that Russia should propose to the other states that they can 'contract in' to strategic defence provided by Russia - as for example, the nuclear early warning system - provided they share the costs and allow their citizens to serve in strategic forces under Russian command. He said that Mr Yeltsin agreed with the thrust of the thinking for a Russian command - but had boxed himself in by 'promises he had to make' that Russia would be the last to create its own forces. This position was now no longer tenable, he said He conceded there was as yet no military doctrine for Russia - saying that the ideas so far produced by experts had 'talked a lot about peace and co-operation, but did not define who we thought the likely enemy would be.' However, he said that a team seconded from the Defence Ministry would begin work with the parliamentary committee next week. If the Commonwealth leaders do reject a unified military command tomorrow, and the process of creation of independent forces begins in earnest, the Commonwealth will have little further content as an executive body. The best that can be hoped for is that the states can agree a process of civilised negotiation on military, as well as on economic and other, cooperation.</p>

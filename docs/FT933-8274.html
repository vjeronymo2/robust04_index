			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Beyond the corner shop - Asian businesses in Britain are widening their ambitions and their appeal under the influence of a second generation The Prophet motive is paramount at the Halal Meat Company. By observing the Islamic traditions on the slaughter of animals (known as halal), the Birmingham butcher says it has maintained its integrity; with a captive Moslem market, its Asian owners say their profit has risen handsomely. The Halal group has grown rapidly since Hafiz Yaqoob, the founder, passed effective management control to his sons, Zahid and Shahid, five years ago. The brothers have developed the core activity, employed, for the first time, non-Asian managers and launched a range of convenience foods under their own brand name, Mr Halal's Kitchen. The Yaqoob brothers are among an increasing number of second-generation British-educated Asians taking their small to medium-sized family-run businesses out of the street corner and into main street. But unlike their fathers this new generation is bringing to their ventures a greater awareness of the wider business environment. This is exposing a gulf in business values and sowing the seeds of potential clashes over the conflicting demands of commerce and culture. In any event, their impact is likely to be felt in two broad areas: Internal organisation. Many Asian-owned businesses were launched as a vehicle for family employment and have been run around shared family responsibilities. Rapid growth over the past two decades has seldom triggered internal changes necessary to manage the larger venture. The management scrutiny exercised by a second generation is often the first time that these companies have undergone such an examination. Easing dependency on the ethnic markets many companies were set up to serve, by pitching products further afield. As in many small businesses, the first thing a second generation does is to create an organised structure and then decide what to develop or ditch, says James Curran of Kingston University and the author of a study on ethnic businesses for the Midland Bank. In Asian-owned companies, he adds, a second-generation is likely to be more receptive to the need for change than would be the case in a traditional mainstream family business. Reorganising their business was the first task confronting the Yaqoobs when their father's illness forced them into the hot seat. 'Most of my 10 years have been spent setting up systems - for finance, sales, shopfloor work and buying, says Zahid Yaqoob, 31, managing director. Similarly, when Imran Ahmad, 34, took over his family bed-and-breakfast in Newcastle upon Tyne, he found a business resembling some he had studied during his MBA at Bradford University. 'The business had plodded along in a haphazard way. A business plan was never produced. The biggest problem was controlling the books. I started looking at these while on visits from Bradford and was drawn into the business,' he says. One early responsibility for both Imran Ahmad and Zahid Yaqoob was dealing with banks. Many first-generation Asians recall with indignation their treatment by clearing banks. Mutual accusations of misunderstanding abound. A second generation is undoubtedly more sensitive to the banks' point of view. 'I was the essential link between the bank and a business which had to expand. What the banks said (on business plans etc) made sense to me, though not to my father,' says Imran Ahmad. Zahid Yaqoob and Imran Ahmad's overhauls, though on a different scale, led to an unpalatable truth - that to manage a growing business professionally, managers and skilled staff would have to be employed from outside the family or a dependent ethnic labour force. Traditionally, this option has been eschewed. Many such businesses fear losing control and are, in any case, suspicious of outsiders. Yet this could change. 'If you have a professional management, then it will insist on skilled workers and jobs based on merit,' says Robert Blackburn of Kingston University and co-author of the Midland report. 'In Asian businesses, this is something that only the second generation can introduce.' Competitive pressures are also likely to erode Asian companies' traditionally homogeneous labour force. Better quality products require more skilled workers. That will force many to the wider labour market. Blackburn says: 'There are some special pressures on Asian-owned companies. As a result of a fall in immigration and better education among British Asians, they are going to have to offer improved jobs packages.' At London food manufacturer Noon Products, Zeenat Harnal, a director and daughter of the founder, G K Noon, says only by employing professionals can the company meet the standards set by its biggest client - Sainsbury. 'We have had to employ food technologists, microbiologists for our laboratory and now quality control experts for our B5750 registration (on quality standards). Our clients welcome this and it reflects our commitment,' she says. Noon Products' foothold in the quality end of the frozen food market illustrates the second area of activity likely to pre-occupy a second generation - easing dependency or even escaping from the narrow consumer base of an ethnic market. More than two-thirds of Noon Products' frozen Indian meals are sold to Sainsbury. Frozen Indian meals are not very popular with Asians. This successful targeting of the mainstream market, says Upkar Pardesi, a small companies specialist at the University of Central England in Birmingham, serves as a useful model. 'The new generation must realise that the only way to grow is by expanding out of the niche market,' he says. 'A new generation will certainly bring more market focus. But it will only work if it ensures the family business possesses the internal structures to absorb new ideas, products and big orders.' Imran Ahmad achieved 'market focus' by moving his B&amp;B away from the student end where his father had opted for an easy return on a largely self-managing business, to the business-client market. He invested about Pounds 100,000 in transforming his 12-room B&amp;B into a 27-bedroom hotel. 'We made a big qualitative move. The only way to develop was to position ourselves in the growing end of the market.' For Zahid Yaqoob, expanding out of the narrow 'Islamic' market was vital. 'Our business could not have carried on if we just sold meat to Moslems in Britain.' He led the move into value-added products such as Halal burgers and sausages. The company is also assembling a 'multi-million pound' project to open abattoirs in Europe to add to the five it runs in the UK and Ireland. These moves into new markets, allied with big internal changes, can add tension to a management team that straddles different cultures. Imran Ahmad points to irritating management issues such as dealing with builders 'who knew there was no one person in charge and sought to exploit it'. This, he says, cost the hotel unnecessary expense. Though many second-generation Asians command a remarkable degree of responsibility at a young age, there is no doubting that the founder remains in overall charge. Zeenat Harnal, 32, leads 60 mainly female production workers; Zahid Yaqoob recruited and heads a team of 'proven meat industry managers'. Both say they bow to their fathers' word. So what if differences occur between conservative founders and their dynamic successors? 'Internal cultural tensions could affect the market position of a company and ultimately its success,' says Ellis Cashmore, of Aston Business School. He cites the example of a large cash and carry business in Birmingham, owned by a Moslem for whom alcohol is prohibited. The owner's son, who was the finance director and also regarded himself as a faithful Moslem, presented a compelling commercial case for selling alcohol, but was overruled by his father. This is an example of how culture can damage commerce. Marrying these twin imperatives could yet prove a profitable path.</p>

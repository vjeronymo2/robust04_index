			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Caroline Straathof: "Kooijmans Asks China For </F> Dialogue"]    [Text] Beijing -- Netherlands Foreign Minister Kooijmans  talked with Chinese leaders on Tuesday about the need for a  dialogue on human rights issues.    While Kooijmans met with Prime Minister Li Peng and his  counterpart Qian Qichen, the confrontation between Beijing and  Washington over human rights escalated. Yesterday student  leader Wang Dan was arrested for the second time in a week for  further questioning.    Kooijmans's U.S. counterpart, Warren Christopher, who is in  Australia and will arrive in Beijing on Friday, said that the  dozens of arrests last weekend "could have a negative impact" on  his visit and on the assessment of Beijing's human rights  policies. President Clinton wants to first see a significant  improvement in human rights before extending China's  most-favored nation trading status another year.    The Chinese Foreign Ministry has accused Clinton of  "irresponsible interference in China's internal affairs." A few  days ago Clinton criticized the arrests in Beijing and Shanghai.  Kooijmans received a similar reaction when he questioned Li and  Qian about the recent arrests.    The Netherlands is avoiding a confrontation to be able to  exercise maximum pressure on Beijing, a civil servant in the  Netherlands delegation said. Nevertheless, Kooijmans spoke of  "difficult discussions." "The Chinese leadership still has very  little sympathy for human rights," he said. "They see foreign  concern in the context of an ideological controversy and believe  that human rights are being used as a political weapon."    Kooijmans said that the Netherlands Government's room for  maneuver should not be compared with that of the U.S.  Government. The U.S. approach "is felt here to be particularly  offensive. This emerged clearly from the reactions," he said.  "We have our own approach. I find it important each time to  inspire confidence by not using human rights as a political  weapon. To show that concern about human rights is real and not  something which you raise for other motives."    The minister said he had "no reason at all" to think that  his  contribution was leading to any change in China's policies.  "But I have been active in human rights long enough to know  that you should never expect results overnight, that it is a  very gradual process," he said.    In addition to the arrests of the dissidents, Kooijmans  discussed with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Premier Li Peng  the Tibet question and China's harder approach to religious  activities. Kooijmans said that in the last year little progress  had been made in China's contacts with the dalai lama, the  exiled Tibetan god-king, or with his representatives.    As for the religious decrees announced last month, the  Chinese Government gave the impression that they were intended  to protect the religious freedom of the recognized religious  communities or to oppose Islamic fundamentalism, Kooijimans said.    Kooijmans said he had the impression that the decrees were  also directed against a number of Christian communities. He  expressed his displeasure about this and advised the Chinese to  contact the World Council of Churches and the Vatican.    Kooijmans also gave his Chinese hosts a new list of names of  people about whom the Netherlands Government is asking for  information. Most of the people mentioned are in prison after  being sentenced in court. A number of them are in  "administrative detention," which comes down to being held for  three to four years without trial.</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AZTECS SHOW PROGRESS IN SCRIMMAGE;  </P> <P> MCGWIRE, TRAKAS MOST IMPRESSIVE AGAINST 'AIR FORCE'  </P> <P> The little things that help college teams win football games are beginning to  come together for San Diego State.  </P> <P> There were a number of them evident Saturday as the Aztecs played a simulated  game against a scout team impersonating Air Force.  </P> <P> First, there was quarterback Dan McGwire opting to tuck the ball away and run  to the sidelines to avoid a loss or a possible interception.  </P> <P> Coach Al Luginbill said the play was McGwire's best -- not just Saturday but of  his Aztec career. It wasn't that it produced yardage; it was that it was not a  negative action.  </P> <P> "Don't do something to kill your team. Keep it alive," Luginbill tells his  quarterbacks.  </P> <P> Doing what he does do best -- throwing the football -- McGwire completed nine  of 13 passes for 143 yards. "Everything was clicking today," he said.  </P> <P> Then there was freshman kicker Andy Trakas, who was most impressive on either:  a) an extra-point attempt that sailed 40 to 50 yards past the end zone, over a  fence and onto Montezuma Road; b) a 35-yard field goal that flew over the  45-foot high, supposed-protective screen behind the goal posts on the south  side of the field, or c) a touchdown-saving tackle on which he caught speedy  Robert Claiborne on a kickoff return.  </P> <P> "He gets the ball up in the atmosphere," Luginbill said. "(One of his kicks)  just might the leave stadium."  </P> <P> And throughout, there was Merten Harris directing the Air Force "look" team.  Harris, playing the part of Falcon quarterback Dee Dowis, gained 70 yards on  seven carries, including a nifty 21-yard touchdown run, and completed eight of  18 passes for 120 yards, including a 25-yard touchdown to Toby Weymiller.  </P> <P> Harris, a receiver, did not care to know his statistics but was told anyway.  With an ever-present smile on his face, Harris said, "Really? I was all right,  huh?"  </P> <P> Indeed.  </P> <P> What Harris provides -- elusiveness, quickness, knowledge of the option and a  pretty good arm -- gives the Aztec defense a chance to practice against Air  Force's wishbone offense.  </P> <P> Said Luginbill, "(Harris) has what I call unconscious ability."  </P> <P> Luginbill said there were other things that pleased him. Penalties were  minimal. The Aztec offense committed no turnovers and forced three by the scout  team (a fumble recovered by John Wesselman and interceptions by Marlon Andrews  and Robert Giffith).  </P> <P> The offensive line, restructured about a week ago, played well, enabling Ron  Slack (10 carries for 118 yards and four touchdowns), Curtis Butts (seven for  80, two TDs) and Darrin Wagner (six for 36, one TD) to run.  </P> <P> Despite some lapses and inconsistencies, the defense also played well, although  it was purposely tested by being placed in difficult situations on almost every  play.  </P> <P> If the final score was kept, it would have been 56-20. Of course, this was just  the scout team. The real Air Force is waiting next Saturday.  </P> <P> Aztec Notes  </P> <P> Just a few plays after making an interception and returning it about 40 yards,  second-team nickel back Robert Griffith broke his left arm during a kickoff. It  was one of those gruesome injuries that required little inquiry or diagnosis.  Griffith was to have been operated on Saturday night by Dr. Peter Wile at Mercy  Hospital. He will be out indefinitely. Another safety, Chris Johnson sprained  his left ankle. Griffith, from Mt. Miguel High, and Johnson, from Crawford, are  both walk-on freshmen. Griffith was redshirted last season. Johnson will likely  be redshirted this year.  </P></p>

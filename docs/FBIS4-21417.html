			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hans Dieter Sauer: ``Opportunities for Export of </F> Environmental Technology to China'']    [Text] [First paragraph editor's summary] VDI-N,  Dusesseldorf, 18 Feb 94--In China all signs point to growth.  Even now, in the early phases of the economic boom, great  ecological dangers are looming on the horizon. An opportunity  for the environmental technology industry: only ecologically  sound businesses will save from China from an eco-disaster.    China's economy is heading for record heights: it led the  world last year with a growth rate of 13 percent. But the period  of frantic economic growth is coming at the expense of the  environment. In the report ``Environmental Strategy for Asia,''  the World Bank is now sounding the alarm. It emphasizes that in  China the destruction of natural resources has already reached a  level which endangers further economic development. China expert  Vaclav Smil of the University of Manitoba in Canada also paints  a dark picture: ``There is no doubt that in spite of advances in  certain areas the condition of the environment in China will be  more alarming in the year 2000 than it was in 1990.''    Chinese scientists are also aware of how serious the  situation is. In the proposal of the environmental report for  1992 the director of the Chinese environmental agency NEPA  (National Environmental Protection Agency), Qu Geping, lamented:  ``Environmental protection in China cannot keep pace with the  reshaping of our economy from a planned economy to a market  economy.'' There it is considered a success if air and water  pollution rise more slowly than economic growth. The emission of  sulfur dioxide rose by ``only'' 3.9 percent to 16.85 million  tons, dust yield rose by 7.9 percent to 14.14 million tons, and  sewage increased by 9 percent to 36.65 billion cubic meters.    Four-fifths of the air pollution is to be blamed on coal as  an energy source: 1.1 billion tons are burned annually,  accounting for 75 percent of Chinese energy use. Two-thirds of  the coal used is burned in industry or for home heating without  further treatment; flue gas treatment is virtually unknown.  According to official reports the permissible average value of  300 micrograms of particles per cubic meter of air is being  exceeded in 50 of 55 cities investigated. By comparison, in  Germany the maximum average annual value is 150 micrograms per  cubic meter.    As a result of the economic boom, environmental stresses  have  also begun to have an effect at ground level. Since the  legalization of private business thousands and thousands of  small businesses have arisen in the villages, and while they  work with high economic efficiency--at the moment they are  producing 30 percent of the gross national product--because of  their primitive technical equipment they emit waste gases and  sewage unfiltered into the environment. Oskar Weggel of the  Institute for Asian Studies in Hamburg gives a vivid  description: ``Innumerable mini-factory chimneys pour coal dust  into the atmosphere, and industrial sewage flows from a  labyrinth of waste pipes into the country's streams and rivers.''    It is not that there are no laws in China against  environmental pollution. Environmental protection is even  anchored in the constitution. But officials on the provincial  and district level have something else on their minds besides  maintaining environmental standards. Last year the central  government was forced to send teams of inspectors through the  provinces to ``raise consciousness about obeying the law.'' A  summary of the results of the investigation stated: ``Many local  politicians are sacrificing the environment in order to make  economic profits.''    But the wretched state of the environment should not be  blamed solely on the rampant uncontrolled growth of the private  sector; the inherited burdens of a planned economy have just as  harmful an effect. According to a NEPA list, approximately 3,000  businesses, most of them still the property of the state,  account for 60 percent of industrial environmental pollution.  Many of these companies have been so mismanaged that there is no  money available for environmental investment.    The leading environmental problem in China is water  pollution. It is true that initial progress was made in the  treatment of industrial wastes in 1992; for instance, arsenic  and cyanide contamination dropped by about 23 percent. But the  treatment of communal sewage is in a very bad state; drains  exist only in the large cities. Of the 13.3 billion cubic meters  of sewage gathered there annually, only 10 percent is  superficially cleaned. In Shanghai, a city of 13 million  inhabitants, only 4 percent of about 2 billion cubic meters of  sewage is cleaned; the rest goes into the Huangpu River  untreated. Since the groundwater is also frequently contaminated  in many places, often 50 million people have only polluted water  to drink.    ``Chinese water services are vitally endangered,'' is the  evaluation of the authors of the report ``Environmental  Protection in the People's Republic of China,'' which was  recently presented at the first German-Chinese environmental  symposium in Bergheim, near Cologne. For the report the Research  Institutes for Water and Waste Management in Aachen and Erfstadt  (FiW) and the Institute for Community Water Management of the  RWTH in Aachen evaluated numerous Chinese sources.    Water pollution is even slowing down further economic  development, regionally speaking. Reiner Fonteyn, chief  executive of the FiW, explains this point with an example from  Shanxi province. There a coal factory cannot be expanded because  the cooling water from the river is already too polluted.  Economic pressure has now forced the construction of a  purification plant for the city of Yangquan, which lies  upstream. ``China has no other choice than to invest massively  in environmental protection,'' according to Fonteyn, whose  institute has now signed cooperative agreements with several  Chinese research institutes about the planning of purification  plants.    In theory, this opens up absolutely unlimited sales  possibilities for German manufacturers of ecotechnology. But  access to the Chinese market is anything but easy. In North  Rhine-Westphalia, companies from the ecotechnology  sector--supported by the Land government--have formed the  association ``Pro Asia e. V.'' to make entry into the market  easier through exchange of information and experience.    The region around the Rhine and the Ruhr is taking on the  role of an outrider in German-Chinese cooperation: it supports  partnerships with three Chinese provinces. As soon as February  the governer of Sichuan province will visit, accompanies by  economic experts, and in March a joint delegation from the  environmental and economic ministries in Duesseldorf will travel  to Jiangsu.    But good relations do not necessarily turn into business  deals. Financing is always a significant hurdle in project  negotiations. The Japanese are emerging as powerful rivals,  facilitating the financing of investments with favorable credit  rates, according to Pro Asia's chairman, Dieter Wunderlich.    Still, German industry is not pursuing a forlorn hope.  According to statistics from the Federal Agency for Foreign  Trade Information (BfAI) in Cologne, German export of  ecotechnology to China has increased in the last few years and  reached a value of DM392 million in 1992. Half of this amount  consisted of high-tech products from the metrological,  regulating and control technologies.    By the year 2000 the Chinese government hopes to have  invested a total of 200 billion yuan, approximately DM40  billion, in environmental protection. But in the opinion of  experts that will only suffice to eliminate the worst damage.  China's environmental crisis cannot be overcome by environmental  repair alone. As early as 1989 the Institute for Ecological  Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences issued this warning:  it is not an increase in the gross national product but planning  for the future that must be the highest political goal. So far  this admonition has fallen on deaf ears: between 1989 and 1993  economic growth increased from 4 percent to 13 percent.</p>

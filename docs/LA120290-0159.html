			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAPERBACKS  </P> <P> TALES FROM MAGARITAVILLE By Jimmy Buffett (Fawcett: $9.95). Like his songs,  Jimmy Buffett's short stories are lightweight, diverting and often funny.  </P> <P> Most of the better stories are set in Heat Wave, a small town on Snake Bite  Key. The pleasantly eccentric inhabitants of the fictional islet include Aurora  and Bora Alice Porter, the twin sisters who run the local coffee shop, and  writer/football coach Romeo Fleming, who keeps the eponymous iguana in "Off to  See the Lizard." The wistful romances in "Take Another Road" and "Boomerang  Love" suggest rum-soaked Tom Robbins stories, although Buffet lacks his flair  for baroque traffic jams of adjectives. The weakest tales in the collection are  the first-person narratives involving a singer-songwriter who bears a  suspicious resemblance to Jimmy Buffet. The author's otherwise unpretentious  style falters in these self-indulgent ego trips, and the stories sink into a  morass of gurgling cutesiness. A good book to read on the plane en route to  some sunny vacation spot -- in search of that missing salt shaker. CHARLES  SOLOMON  </P></p>

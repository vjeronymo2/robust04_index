			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: Sabic falls 14% on softer petrochemicals prices SAUDI Basic Industries Corporation (Sabic), the Saudi Arabian industrial conglomerate responsible for the kingdom's petrochemicals industry, has reported a 14 per cent fall in net profits to SR1.96bn (Dollars 523.7m) for 1992, from SR2.3bn the year before. It ascribes the drop to softer petrochemicals prices. Mr Abdulaziz al-Zamil, Sabic chairman and the kingdom's industry minister, said production from the 18 plants in which Sabic holds a stake had risen by 19 per cent to 15.7m tonnes, with sales up by 23.9 per cent to 12.5m tonnes. Overall sales revenue rose to SR13bn from SR9bn. Sabic, which is 70 per cent owned by the government, is undertaking a Dollars 6bn expansion programme aimed at raising output of MTBE, ethylene, polyethylene, ammonia, urea and other petrochemical products to 17m tonnes, rising to 20m tonnes later this decade.</p>

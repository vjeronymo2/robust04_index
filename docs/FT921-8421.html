			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Howard condemns Labour's 'evil' links - Unions THE Conservatives yesterday fielded no fewer than six ministers at a press conference in an attempt to raise the profile of Labour's trades union links in the election campaign. Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, warned that a government led by Mr Neil Kinnock would return Britain to the industrial relations chaos of the 1970s. Flanked by among others, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, and Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, Mr Howard described Labour's policies as 'made for the unions by the unions'. Referring at one point to the 'evil' links which gave trade union leaders control of Labour's policymaking machinery, he added that it would: Wreck industrial relations legislation and give the unions all the rights and privileges they wanted. Introduce a national minimum wage, putting up industry's costs and throwing up to 2m people out of work. Hamstring Britain's 'training revolution' by letting the unions dominate Training and Enterprise Councils. Mr Howard will take up the theme in a Commons debate today in which the government hopes to rekindle memories of the winter of discontent, which brought down the last Labour government in 1979. His comments were derided by Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary. He said in a statement that the charges were 'a pathetic attempt to divert attention from the Conservatives' mismanagement of the economy'.</p>

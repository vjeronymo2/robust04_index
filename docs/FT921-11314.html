			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Guinness Peat Aviation plans April flotation GUINNESS Peat Aviation, the aircraft leasing company, is considering raising about Dollars 700m (Pounds 386m) of new money in its flotation, which it plans to bring forward to April. However, shares with a value of up to Dollars 1.5bn are likely to be on offer, the precise amount depending on how many of its existing shareholders wish to sell. The flotation, aimed primarily at investment institutions, will be one of the most ambitious attempts to market shares in the big share markets of the world. Air Canada and Aer Lingus own substantial blocks of shares, each worth about Dollars 200m, and are expected to sell part of their holdings. Air Canada said the company would sell its holding if the price was right. The company would not comment on what price would be acceptable, but industry sources believe it is looking for a price in excess of Dollars 20 a share. The biggest shareholder is Japan's Mitsubishi group of companies with 16 per cent. Advisers to the group, which include Nomura, the global co-ordinator, the UK merchant bank, Schroders, and Goldman Sachs of the US, are understood to have recommended different share prices ranging from Dollars 17 to Dollars 23. GPA would prefer to get the issue away with a higher share price. The sale will help GPA finance its ambitious programme of aircraft purchases. To the year 2000 it has firm orders of Dollars 11.9bn and a further Dollars 9.2bn of non-binding commitments. Last summer, GPA asked the huge Japanese securities firm, Nomura, to examine the possibility of a flotation, though GPA has never given a commitment that it would go public. Nonetheless there has been speculation that a share sale would take place towards the end of the year. However, GPA has decided to accelerate the flotation process to take advantage of the buoyancy of the US stock market. It hopes to make a preliminary filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US regulator, by the end of February.</p>

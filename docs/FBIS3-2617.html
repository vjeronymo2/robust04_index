			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chen Pi-chun (7115 4310 0689) in Beijing: "Zhu Rongji </F> Orders High-Ranking Officials To Strictly Control Scale of  Credit and Capital Construction"]    [Text] Recently Zhu Rongji, vice premier of the Chinese  State Council and president of the People's Bank of China,  notified high-ranking officials in central ministries and  commissions of the key policy on this year's monetary work and  asked them to strictly control capital construction and credit  scales. Zhu Rongji's instructions indicate the recurrence of  willful fund raising.    Zhu Rongji pointed out that the policy for monetary work  this  year will basically exercise macrocregulation and control. He  stressed: The "rules and regulations" set by the national  monetary work meeting in July last year should continue to be  implemented; financial institutions are not allowed to violate  these regulations to raise funds, to build development zones  without authorization, or to speculate in stock or real estate  businesses.    As learned, capital construction in China was planned to  reach 800 billion yuan, but turned out to be 1,100 billion yuan,  far exceeding the plan. According to an estimate by a mainland  official, 40 percent of the investment in capital construction  was spent on cement, steel, other building materials, and  equipment; some was used for workers' wages. As a result, 40  yuan out of each 100 yuan invested became consumption funds,  which constitutes purchasing power in the market and has caused  successive price hikes.    As reported, China's scale of capital construction  investment  this year will be bigger than last year, reaching more than  1,500 billion yuan. According to Zhu Rongji's plan for monetary  work, the key to controlling the scale of capital construction  is to control bank loans and plug channels for willful fund  raising. With these aspects under control, the issuance of  money can also be controlled and inflation reduced. The  authorities plan to control inflation to below 10 percent this  year and reduce inflation next year to about 6 percent, Zhu  Rongji pointed out.    As was learned, two-thirds of China's investment in capital  construction last year was in local construction projects, while  one-third was used under central plans. Now, provinces and  cities throughout China, out of consideration for their own  interests, are carrying out their own capital construction  projects, including airports, highways, power stations, and  ports. All of these are proceeding in excess of the state annual  plan and are dispersing state financial and material resources.  However, reports say that the Chinese authorities have  postponed reforms to the central bank, the policy banks, and the  commercial banks from the beginning of this year to the second  half of this year.</p>

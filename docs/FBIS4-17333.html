			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 23 KYODO -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin suggests in memoirs to be published next month that  Russia may reconsider economic reform being carried out under  the leadership of Western organizations such as the  International Monetary Fund.    He says in the private notes that two years of economic  reform carried out by former First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor  Gaydar showed Russia's peculiarities and that "Russia must go  its own way."    KYODO NEWS SERVICE has obtained a copy of his memoirs to be  published early may in Russia and abroad.    In it he describes how he has watched and reacted to recent  developments in Russia and the former Soviet Union.    It covers the failed coup attempt by conservatives in the  former Soviet Union in August 1991 and the military crackdown  against rebel members of the Russian parliament last October.    Yeltsin said he adopted "shock treatment" by Gaydar, once  the  main architect of Russia's reforms, because his theories were  the most convincing among those of many economists.    Yeltsin defended the radical economic policy, saying it  would  have been impossible for Russia to carry out any different  policy.    On hyperinflation brought about by the introduction of  market  reforms, Yeltsin said every nation, without exception, has  passed through this sort of era.    The memoirs also give Yeltsin's account of his use of troops  against conservatives holed up in the White House parliament  building in Moscow last October.    Yeltsin reveals that he went through "a critical situation"  because at first the military did not obey his order to attack  the rebels. After declaring a state of emergency, he had tried  to dispatch the military to suppress mobs attacking key city  buildings, but the troops were slow to act.    By finally persuading the military to agree to attack the  White House, Yeltsin managed to force the surrender of the  conservatives, led by former Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy  and former parliament chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov.    In sharp contrast with bitter remarks about former political  foes, Yeltsin praises incumbent government ministers led by  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.    He calls Chernomyrdin a man who is reliable and has never  betrayed his expectations.    Describing a visit to Japan shortly after last autumn's  turmoil in Moscow, Yeltsin said he went ahead with it out of  concern that suspending it might have damaged bilateral ties for  a long period.    "If it had not been to Japan, I could have canceled the  visit, but I thought I must go," he writes. [sentence as  received]    Before last October's visit, Yeltsin had twice called off  scheduled trips to Japan.    He indicates his desire to complete his four-year term of  office, saying he will leave politics in accordance with the  constitution.    A Japanese-language version of the book is scheduled to be  published early May, publishing world sources said. The book  will be titled as Yeltsin's Memoirs -- Behind the Scenes  of Collapse and Confrontation."</p>

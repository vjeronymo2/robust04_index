			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. COUNTY REDISTRICTING PUT ON HOLD  </P> <P> The fact that the fight over fair representation on the Board of Supervisors  represented "politics at its most arrogant" was about the only correct  statement in Ronald B. Turovsky's analysis ("Drawn and Quartered, but Still  Looking Out for No. 1," Commentary, Aug. 6).  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge David Kenyon, working hand-in-hand with MALDEF and the  ACLU, did indeed carve out a district shaped like a donkey in a blatantly  political effort to create a liberal Democratic district for City Councilwoman  Gloria Molina. It is not a coincidence that Molina, a member of the MALDEF  board, wants to run for the County Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> The fact that Judge Kenyon would deny the people a voice in the drafting of new  lines and the fact that Sarah Flores, a Latina Republican, was the odds-on  favorite to win a board seat in November, underlines the real  Kenyon-MALDEF-ACLU agenda: the creation of a tailor-made district for an  ultra-liberal candidate.  </P> <P> That is politics at its most crass.  </P> <P> Neither The Times nor Turovsky bothered to note that a liberal Democrat  majority dominated the Board of Supervisors in the 1970s. Nor have you noted  that, with no change in district lines, the balance of power was changed by the  people in 1980 -- a year before the latest reapportionment. The 1981  redistricting process, incidentally, was a minor movement of boundary lines to  accommodate the change in population as required by law.  </P> <P> When Turovsky refers to the current board's interest in self-preservation, he  fails to note that Kenyon's proposal creates a plan in which all incumbents  (Kenneth Hahn, Ed Edelman, Deane Dana and myself) remain as residents.  </P> <P> Interestingly enough, the judge retained a 3rd District for Edelman, who won  his race in the same June primary that saw Sarah Flores emerge as the leader in  the 1st District. But the judge created a new 1st District in which Molina is a  resident and Flores' residence is excluded.  </P> <P> He "generously" ruled that Flores may continue her candidacy as long as she is  willing to sell her home and leave her community in the event of her election.  </P> <P> The district lines that were drawn in 1981 did not discriminate against any  group because of ethnicity, and all members of our board have so testified.  </P> <P> Failure by the Board of Supervisors to appeal Kenyon's tyrannical rulings would  be an arrogant disservice to all of the people of Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> MICHAEL D. ANTONOVICH  </P> <P> Supervisor, 5th District  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 16 (XINHUA) -- China's exports grew  faster than its imports in the first four months of this year.    This was revealed by the latest statistics from the Chinese  Customs Department, which showed that the country's foreign  trade volume was 21.1 percent greater than in the same period  last year, with a total trade volume of 57.84 billion U.S.  dollars.    Imports in the period totalled 29.79 billion U.S. dollars  (up  20.3 percent over the same period of 1993), while exports  amounted to 28.04 billion U.S. dollars (up 22 percent).    That China's export growth rate is higher than the import  one  is attributed by experts to a series of macro-control measures  and national foreign trade reform started in the latter half of  last year and at the beginning of this year, in response to a  then- growing trade deficit.    Japan is still the largest of all of China's trade partners:  the bilateral trade volume reached 11.03 billion U.S. dollars,  (up 34.9 percent), and made up 20.7 percent of the country's  total foreign trade volume.    China's other large trade partners include Hong Kong, the  European Community, the United States and Taiwan.    The trade volume of China's joint ventures reached 21.33  billion U.S. dollars (up 46.9 percent), a much higher rise than  the country's average foreign trade growth rate. The figure  represents 36.9 percent of China's total foreign trade volume,  compared with the 30.5 percent which this sector achieved in the  same period last year.</p>

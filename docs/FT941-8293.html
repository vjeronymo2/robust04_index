			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Boardrooms pressed on standards Government-sponsored guide-lines are published today which aim to increase the professionalism of company directors. The guidelines were commissioned by the Department of Employment last year in response to corporate scandals and to concerns that many company boards do not function properly. They say chief executives need up to 25 personal attributes including energy, imagination and openness if they are to be effective. 'I'd be surprised if too many companies were living up to these standards at the moment,' said Mr Victor Dulewicz of the Henley Management College. 'Most would admit there is scope for improvement.' The draft standards, drawn up by the college and the Institute of Directors, cover every aspect of the skills, composition and behaviour of boards of directors. The guidelines say directors have four primary tasks: to establish a company's vision, mission and values; to set strategy and structure; to supervise management; and to be responsible to stakeholders. The standards also establish principles for chairmen to ensure that the structure of the board is correct and is run in an efficient manner. The guidelines are likely to meet opposition from many companies which feel that the behaviour of boards is something that should vary from one company to another and does not lend itself to fixed rules. Mr John Harper, development director at the institute and co-author of the report, said that although the standards did not hold out a promise to make every company outstandingly successful, they offered a generally applicable checklist against which companies could measure their performance. Mr Harper said the lists of requirements for directors were based on the views of hundreds of board directors interviewed over the past year. He said that if one board member lacked certain attributes, other board members should be found who possessed them. The guidelines are being circulated for discussion and a final version will be drawn up in the autumn. The standards, which will be non-binding, are being seen as complementary to the Cadbury report on the financial aspects of corporate governance which has laid down guidelines on the accountability of directors of quoted companies.</p>

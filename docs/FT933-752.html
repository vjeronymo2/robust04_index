			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Keidanren calls for tax cuts THE Keidanren, Japan's top business federation, stepped up pressure for tax cuts after government hints over the weekend that reductions were possible. 'During these tough economic times, we need to have a drastic income tax cut, along with an easing of corporate tax,' said Mr Hiroshi Saito, Keidanren vice chairman and chairman of Nippon Steel. A day earlier Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, told a press conference in Washington that 'expectations. . . for tax cuts will not be betrayed'. Tax reform is being studied by a government panel, which is considering proposing a cut in income tax, to be financed by a subsequent rise in consumption tax. The panel is due to report in time for the government to decide on any changes before the end of the current tax year to March. It is a politically divisive question for the seven-party coalition government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa because the largest coalition partner, the Social Democratic party, formerly the Japan Socialist party, is unwilling to accept a rise in consumption tax, which is likely to harm poorer voters. Senior Keidanren members also urged the government yesterday to consider setting a rough, but not binding, target for the reduction of Japan's record current account surplus, a serious irritant to relations with its main trade partners. 'It is important to show clearly Japan's strong intention to cut the surplus,' said Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota, the car maker. The continuing dispute with the US over this is seen as a factor in the rise of the yen, which has hit Japanese exporters' profits. Mr Toyoda opposed US demands for a numerically targeted cut in the trade surplus, but said Japan should set its own medium- to long-term target for reducing the surplus, not to be seen as a promise. Japanese crude steel output is set to fall by an annualised 3.7 per cent in the final quarter of the calendar year, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry forecast yesterday. This will represent a 1.9 per cent decline from the current three-month period, and be the first drop in four quarters.</p>

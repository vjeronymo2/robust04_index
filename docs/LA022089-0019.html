			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICER GEORGE VEST;  </P> <P> DISCREET EXIT AFTER 41 YEARS AS DIPLOMAT  </P> <P> For America's senior diplomat, it was strictly deja vu. A new secretary of  state -- this time, James A. Baker III -- was coming into office with his own  set of top aides. And the advice of partisan supporters was ringing in their  ears: "Don't let the Foreign Service take you over."  </P> <P> As George Vest -- a 41-year veteran of the service -- lamented in a recent  interview, the State Department's new management always takes the advice.  Convinced that the career Foreign Service wants to pursue its own agenda  regardless of the new President's foreign policy, the new bosses try to  distance themselves from the diplomats who had served the previous  Administration.  </P> <P> Fortunately, Vest said, their resolve lasts only "until they run into problems.  As challenges come up and they need the knowledge, it tends to break down the  barriers. It is a natural evolution they have to go through."  </P> <P> This time, Vest will not be around to see the drama play itself all the way  out. At 70, he will step down soon from his post as director general of the  Foreign Service. The exact date of his retirement has not been set because  Baker has not yet named a successor.  </P> <P> Vest's career has spanned virtually the entire era of post-World War II  diplomacy. He joined the Foreign Service in 1947 as a consular employee in  Bermuda, a holiday island but diplomatic backwater.  </P> <P> In the ensuing 41 years, Vest became a top expert on Europe, holding jobs that  included chief U.S. representative at the conference that produced the historic  Helsinki Accords on human rights in 1975 and assistant secretary of state for  European policy. He also served a brief -- and, he admits, often unhappy --  stint as chief spokesman for Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger.  </P> <P> "I've been around longer than all of the others," Vest said. "I don't know that  antiquity is necessarily a virtue. But it is a distinction."  </P> <P> In today's State Department, a 41-year career is nothing short of amazing. An  increasingly stringent "up-or-out" policy is forcing most professional  diplomats to the sidelines long before their 65th birthdays, often after 20  years or less in the service.  </P> <P> It seems certain that some of Vest's career Foreign Service colleagues, now in  the top ranks of the State Department, will join him in retirement in the  coming weeks because Baker will have no jobs for them in the new  Administration. But, for the most part, they do not yet know who they are  because the incoming secretary has been moving very slowly in filling the  department's key jobs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Orderly Disorder'  </P> <P> Vest described the transition to the Baker State Department as "orderly  disorder." It is orderly, he said, because the new Administration is waiting  until the Senate confirms an official before naming his subordinates. It is  disorderly because it is slow and many important jobs have not yet been filled.  </P> <P> "Even the ones of us that are going to be replaced are dedicated  professionals," Vest said. "We are really foreign policy junkies. We want to  see the job done well."  </P> <P> For the last four years, Vest has held the State Department's top personnel  post, handling the assignments for the nation's professional diplomats except  for the handful who receive presidential appointments. It is a job that  sometimes has tested the even temper and unflappable courtliness that have  become his trademark.  </P> <P> "I get every month something called the 'sin report' for the Foreign Service,"  he said. "I dole out the punishment. I had no idea of the endless variety of  sin until I took this job."  </P> <P> Very few of the violations of discipline, he said, involve hard drugs, even  though there are many opportunities for diplomats to dabble in narcotics  smuggling. Diplomats have access to the diplomatic pouch, which is not subject  to customs inspection as it carries letters and goods across national borders,  and they often serve in areas where drugs are readily available.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lonely Life  </P> <P> "Drugs have never been a problem in the Foreign Service, although liquor has  been," Vest said. "We have had trouble with alcoholism. It can be a lonely  life.  </P> <P> "Of course there are a lot of opportunities to drink at diplomatic functions,"  he said. "But the problem comes when they get home and are alone. The largest  problem with alcoholism is with single people overseas.  </P> <P> "We say to them that it is a disease and we don't hold it against them," he  added. "We send them home without prejudice and send them to a place to work on  the problem."  </P> <P> Looking back at his own career, Vest said that his only truly bad assignment  was his first one at the consulate in Bermuda, a self-governing British  possession.  </P> <P> "I hated the consul (his boss), and he deserved all my hatred," he said. "I was  not a success."  </P> <P> Despite the friction with his superior, Vest was given a second chance, at the  U.S. Embassy in Ecuador. He fared better there, even though the ambassador --  after reviewing the personnel reports he had received in Bermuda -- told him:  "You have the worst file of any junior officer I've ever known."  </P> <P> After Ecuador, Vest was ticketed for the Dominican Republic. After he spent  most of his savings on warm-weather clothing, he was transferred to Ottawa, the  Canadian city that claims to be the second coldest capital in the world.  </P> <P> Problems with his wardrobe aside, the switch proved to be a fortunate one. The  State Department, responding far more to history and culture than geography,  includes Canada in its European bureau, and Vest's assignment there focused  most of the rest of his career on Europe.  </P> <P> He said that his most satisfying assignment was chief of the U.S. delegation to  the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Helsinki conference,  which ratified the postwar boundaries of the continent and -- probably far more  significantly -- established new standards for human rights in the Soviet Union  and the rest of Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> "I think we began something that is quite important, a way of legitimizing the  aspirations of the people of Eastern Europe," he said. "It has become a beacon  light to (Eastern European dissidents). They could believe they were not  alone."  </P> <P> He said that the Helsinki conference may have loosened the Soviet grip on  Eastern Europe in a way that John Foster Dulles, President Dwight D.  Eisenhower's hard-line secretary of state, had been unable to do with a  diplomacy that he once described as "bringing the world to the brink of war."  </P> <P> "If you were to put it in the terms that John Foster Dulles used," Vest said,  "you could say we may be seeing a peaceful rollback of Soviet power."  </P></p>

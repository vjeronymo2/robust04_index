			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: How Perpetual profits from a fresh outlook - The Fund Managers MOST FUND managers work in air conditioned offices to the sound of traffic and sirens. Not so at Perpetual Investment in Henley, Berkshire, where the managers sit by open windows, listening to the occasional chug of a passing pleasure boat or a quack from a duck on the river Thames. Something in the air may be doing the managers good, because Perpetual's unit trusts have an enviable short-term performance record. Founder and chairman Martin Arbib is puzzled why, given its record, Perpetual has not got more than the current Pounds 400m under management. One explanation is that Perpetual has put relatively few resources into marketing compared with its competitors. Perpetual's independent status, short life and comparative lack of City connections has meant that it has had to compete on performance alone. Perpetual's story goes back to September 1974, when Martin Arbib, a chartered accountant, launched the first fund just before the stock market recovered from the 1973-4 crash. In the early 1970s, Arbib had run a small number of portfolios for friends, making money even during the crash. In response to his friends' requests, he set up his own independent pension fund and unit trust company. Although it was listed on the stock exchange in 1987, Arbib remains the dominant shareholder. Perpetual is currently trying to build up its pension business, but its name has been made in unit trusts. Some of Perpetual's managers are regarded as demanding clients - Arbib is reputed to terrify certain stockbrokers. In the flesh, he is friendly and down to earth, proud owner of Snurge, the St Leger-winning racehorse. Each fund's investment objective is to achieve performance in the top quartile (best 25 per cent), although the second quartile may be acceptable for more cyclical funds, such as Worldwide Recovery and International Emerging Companies. As the table shows, the funds have certainly lived up to this target over three years, with eight out of nine producing above average performances and six in the top quartile. Both the funds with 10 year performance records are in the top quartile over that longer period, as are three of the four funds with seven year records. The five-year figures are less impressive. Only one of the seven funds established before 1985 is in the top quartile, and four have below average performances. Why do most of Perpetual's figures look so good? Since it is all down to the fund managers, Arbib may be right that it is the misery of the city'. Managers only travel up to London when absolutely necessary; plenty of companies and brokers come to Henley, which is conveniently close to Heathrow airport. An obsession with performance has led to the development of a sophisticated performance measuring computer system, which enables funds to be broken down and analysed minutely. It is possible to monitor a junior manager who is starting out by managing a regional section of an international fund. It is also possible to see whether managers are doing as well managing a section of one of the international funds as their own. Perpetual's managers work in regional teams, with a total of 11 in the investment department. There is a formal monthly asset allocation meeting, but managers are pretty autonomous. The method tends to be 'bottom up', but the approach varies. For instance, Scott McGlashan, who is in charge of the Far East, takes an idiosyncratic approach to the Japanese market, which he says, tends to be based on speculative pushes by the big broking houses. 'All I look for is individual shares with reasonable growth prospects and a strong balance sheet whose price earnings ratio is two thirds of the market. I look at ten-year records to identify strong management in times of weakness. I don't spend more than two weeks a year in Japan as I've found diminishing returns in visiting companies.' He also uses warrants and options extensively to protect against falls in the market. Bob Yerbury, in charge of the North American funds, tends to look more at sector allocation, and attributes strong performance recently to a heavy weighting in financials in 1989 up until the crash of the savings and loans market, and energy stocks last summer. Recently he has been buying stocks geared to the economic cycle. Sharp selling, he says, has also helped. For the UK funds, Stephen Whittaker tends to pick stocks rather than sectors, and likes to be fully invested even when the market is falling. This year he has switched his investment policy away from holding large, stable industrials and defensive stocks in sectors like electricity, water and food, to buying smaller, undervalued companies. He acquired 22 new holdings on one day in January. The UK holdings in the PEP Growth &amp; Income fund, for which he is also responsible, tend to be more conservative than in the UK Growth fund, although last year, British Aerospace and British Steel were core companies of both. High income, which is the higher yielding fund (7 per cent), includes both convertibles and overseas stocks, and has performed better recently than the older Income fund. The difference appears to be one of management. Since Whittaker took over the fund last October, performance has improved, and capital, rather than a rising dividend will remain the priority. Bill Murfett, who is responsible for European investment, favours technical analysis to spot undervalued markets and shares. He also tries to be as liquid as possible and thus tends to hold several blue chips. Last year, this did not pay off too well as, he believes, much of the strongest performance came from second and third line stocks. The fund's record is better over three years. With fewer than half Perpetual's funds having seven-year records, it has yet to be seen whether the group can produce long term performance across a wide range of funds. But if the group can keep up the record of the past three years, it will deserve to be taken very seriously.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Perpetual unit trusts  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                   Size (poundsm)   Launched     3 yr performance                                                 Fund      Sector  --------------------------------------------------------------------- American Grth         39.1           1983       +76.7      +41.0 Asian Sm Mkts         15.1           1990        n/a        n/a European Grth         58.8           1986       +63.8      +46.4 Far East Grth         35.6           1985       +27.6      +18.6 High Income            6.6           1988       +43.6      +18.7 Income                53.8           1979       +21.1      +22.1 Intl Emerg Cos        13.5           1984       +40.4      +23.6 Intl Grth             98.0           1974       +29.4      +23.6 Japanese Grth         16.9           1988        n/a        n/a PEP Grth &amp; Inc        10.7           1989        n/a        n/a UK Growth             46.1           1987       +41.2      +14.9 World Recvy           22.9           1982       +49.2      +23.6 All figs, offer to bid with income reinvested over 3 yrs to April 1.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Finstat  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

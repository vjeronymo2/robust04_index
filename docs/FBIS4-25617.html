			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Liang Chao: "More foreigners flock to Beijing"] </F>   [Text] Increasing numbers of foreigners have been settling  in Beijing to work or study for more than a year at a time.    The number of foreigners issued the official green card  increased by 30 percent last year. The total rose from 36,000  in 1992 to more than 50,000 last year, police said this week.    The bulk of green card recipients are students, business  people, and foreign experts. Police say they are drawn to China  by its social and economic stability and rising living standards  and opportunities.    The numbers of students from neighbouring and developing  countries doubled to 2,000 in 1993. The number of specialists  from developed countries soared from 3,000 in 1992 to more than  6,800 in 1993.    Police said numerous foreign businessmen want to invest here  because of improved legal protection. They also claimed that  Beijing's low crime rate is a big drawing card for businesses  looking to invest in a large international city.    Contrasting with the increase in long-term foreign  residents,  the number of Chinese going abroad from Beijing for personal  reasons dropped more than 18 per cent.    According to the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau  (BMPSB), only 36,000 Beijing residents applied to emigrate,  study, work, or visit families or relatives abroad in 1993.    That's a 10,000 person fall-off in one year, according to  the  bureau .    Sources said the city's policy to encourage students to make  full use of their talents has been a leading factor in the  decline of self-financed study abroad.    The drop occurred despite government efforts to make it  easier for the capital's residents to apply for exit visas since  1992.    The new rules ask police to approve applications within 30  days. And the waiting period has decreased to about 20 days,  said an officer with the bureau's Division of Aliens and  Exit-Entry Administration.    Beijing police have been authorized to issue a permanent  residence card for foreigners who make important contributions  to economic development or cultural exchanges with other  countries.    So far, few foreigners have received the right to stay  longer  than one year in Beijing--or to become honorary Chinese  citizens, which allows them to stay as long as they wish.    In the last few years, the latter title was bestowed on  several foreign experts who devoted themselves to the  development of China's culture and economics, the officer said.</p>

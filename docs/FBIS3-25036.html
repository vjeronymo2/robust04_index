			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The former rebel Renamo [Mozambique National  Resistance] movement in Mozambique has moved so many of its  guerrillas into the newly opened assembly points that the camps  are already overcrowded. UN Operations in Mozambique says the  big influx of Renamo members took place at two assembly areas  which were opened early this week. Each was designed to  accommodate 500 men, but on Wednesday [2 February] 723 Renamo  guerrillas arrived at Mocubela in the northern Province of  Zambezia, and further south at Savane in Sofala Province 928  Renamo members arrived.    Throughout the country there are now nearly 18,000  government  soldiers and about 11,000 Renamo guerrillas in assembly areas.  The men are being disarmed under a peace agreement signed by  the government and Renamo in October 1992. Under the terms of  the agreement a total of about 80,000 men should go to the  assembly points. Fifteen thousand men from each side are to be  incorporated into a new unified defense force while the rest are  to be demobilized.</p>

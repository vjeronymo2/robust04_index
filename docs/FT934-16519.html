			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Halifax reports 1% rise in house prices HOUSE PRICES recorded an annual increase last month for the first time since January 1991, according to Halifax. Britain's biggest building society said the average price of a house had risen by 1 per cent to Pounds 63,214 during the 12 months to the end of September. This compares with a year-on-year fall of 2.3 per cent in August. Comparisons have been distorted by house price falls in August and September last year when sterling was forced out of the European exchange rate mechanism. Halifax said if prices remained stable during the next two or three months it would expect the annual rise in house prices to increase to between 2 and 3 per cent by the end of this year. This would still leave prices below the Pounds 68,000 cost of an average house in 1991, the society said. It warned that the recovery remained very fragile with many potential purchasers still concerned about the state of the economy, particularly the high level of unemployment. This is supported by another survey, published yesterday by Nationwide Building Society, which showed that average house prices had fallen by 1.8 per cent last month compared with August. Nationwide said its figures showed prices had risen 2.5 per cent in the first nine months of this year. The society's September figure, however, conflicted with the Halifax survey which reported a small rise, of 0.3 per cent, compared with August. The Halifax said its figures, unlike those from Nationwide, were adjusted to take account of seasonal variations. It said that after 'averaging out' various monthly rises and falls, prices generally had remained flat since sterling left the exchange rate mechanism. New house prices remained unchanged on the August figure and were still 1.4 per cent lower than during September last year, reflecting the determination of housebuilders to increase volume sales as the market starts to recover. The average cost of a new home last month was Pounds 68,000 compared with Pounds 68,979 12 months earlier. Some regions have seen house prices fall by more than 30 per cent since 1988 but Nationwide expects the recovery to gather pace next year and is forecasting an average price rise, for all homes, of 5 per cent in 1993.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today in Dresden, Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada,  president of the National Assembly of the People's Government,  said that U.S. President William Clinton has modified the U.S.  policy toward Cuba, even though an eventual softening of the  blockade would take place only if he were to be elected to a  second term. In statements to DPA, Alarcon de Quesada pointed  out that Clinton inherited the U.S. policy toward Cuba from the  Bush administration, along with the Torricelli Law reinforcing  the blockade that has affected Cuba for more than 30 years.    According to the same source, Alarcon de Quesada expressed  moderate enthusiasm to his German hosts on the possibility of a  softening of the blockade on Cuba during the second half of  President Clinton's current term or in an eventual second term.</p>

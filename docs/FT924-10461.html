			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: UBS predicts advance in current year UNION BANK of Switzerland, the country's largest commercial bank, said group profit for 1992 would be up from 1991 due to improved cash flow, Reuter reports from Zurich. UBS said trading results in the third quarter were excellent. After-tax consolidated cashflow in the first nine months was below budget, but still higher than in the same period a year ago. 'Assuming no unforeseen events occur, the results for the current year should be better than last year's,' it said. A number of Swiss equity analysts have forecast UBS's group net profit will rise by between 10 per cent and 14 per cent this year from last year's record SFr1.22bn (Dollars 890m). The parent company assets rose by SFr2.2bn in the third quarter to SFr204.2bn. The bank, which had already said it expected improved earnings this year, said personnel and general expenses were below budget in the third quarter. 'The necessary depreciation and provisions are expected to remain high in 1992,' it said. 'The ensuing increase in cash flow should nonetheless spell a year-on-year improvement in group results,' it added. UBS said the good third-quarter result, which it did not quantify, largely reflected peak earnings in foreign exchange and banknote trading, although trading in securities failed to match results of the two preceding quarters.</p>

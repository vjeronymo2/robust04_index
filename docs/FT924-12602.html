			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Regal moves to gain sounder footing Regal Hotel announced a capital reconstruction, a voluntary arrangement and a rights issue to raise Pounds 800,000 together with results for the 1991 year and interims for the subsequent period to July 12 1992. The rights issue - 15 new shares of   1/4 p for each existing 2p share at 1/2 p - will represent 86.7 per cent of the enlarged capital. The voluntary arrangement will see creditors offered 10 per cent of their agreed claims in new shares. Pre-tax losses last year were sharply reduced to Pounds 844,000 (Pounds 11.7m) and losses per share from 109.99p to 7.85p.

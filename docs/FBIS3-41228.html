			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Quito--The money laundering gang recently broken up  by the police in Operation "Azteca" used a variety of methods to  bring into Ecuador an amount exceeding $2.5 million the result  of drug trafficking, according to an Interpol report.    One courier was Colombian national Sandra Liliana Angel  Gutierrez, the current companion of the drug trafficker just  arrested in Mexico. Others were her compatriots Areli Cacho,  Nora Martinez Pelaez, Alejandro and Luis Alberto Gutierrez  Flores, Marisol N., Marco N., and Andrea N. These persons  frequently visited Ecuador and brought in dollars attached to  their bodies.    On other occasions the money was carried in suitcases. To  pass through customs without being checked, police officers Hugo  Jativa and Wilson Salgado, as well as customs appraiser Victor  Hugo Valdiviezo, worked with the gang.    Another method for bringing in drug money was the use of  express delivery services like DHL, EMS, and World Courier.    The police report also says that another method they used  was  bank transfers, whose final destination was Bogota. From there,  the foreign currency was sent to Ipiales, where exchange trader  Gerardo Villota (currently a fugitive and closely connected with  the criminal organization), exchanged these funds for Colombian  pesos and deposited them in one of the many bank accounts opened  by Modesto Polo Perez, who was arrested here on 28 December.    Those pesos were withdrawn in amounts that did not violate  the legal limits set by Colombia, and were then converted into  sucres and brought to Quito to be used to buy checks in dollars  and to purchase assets and real estate, vehicles, and commercial  property.    As the police have already reported, it is estimated that  over $2.5 million entered Ecuador, particularly during the last  two of the seven years during which the Montenegro Freire family  has lived in this city. This amount does not include the money  deposited in numerous bank accounts. These accounts have been  frozen and are now being investigated to determine the financial  movements of the Azteca criminal organization.</p>

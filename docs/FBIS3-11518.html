			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Getulio Bittencourt from New York] </F>   [Text] During his trip to the United States last week, the  last question asked of Finance Minister Fernando Henrique  Cardoso elicited the only vague reply. So, will you run for the  presidency of the Republic, Mr. Cardoso, or is it still a  secret? "It is not a secret," he answered calmly, "but I still  have to settle some things. I have not yet made up my mind."    The international financial community does not hide its  preference for the finance minister as the next Brazilian  president. Thomas J. Trebat, an executive manager from the  Chemical Bank, contends that Cardoso is the best hope for the  continuity of the present economic reforms under the next  Brazilian president.    Tamzin Hobday, a Latin American expert at Baring Securities,  cherishes the hope that a coalition among the PSDB [Brazilian  Social Democracy Party], the PFL [Liberal Front Party], and the  "ethical sector" from the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement  Party] will choose Cardoso as presidential candidate. Ed  Cabrera, a Latin American expert at Merrill Lynch, believes that  if Cardoso's stabilization program achieves a measure of success  he will outpoll all the other candidates, heading a center-left  coalition in the runoff elections.</p>

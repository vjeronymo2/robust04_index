			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Interesting Sir, In Thursday's issue, Samuel Brittan (Economic Viewpoint) warns that to cut UK interest rates would 'over-egg the domestic pudding'; two pages further on Lex tells us that 'an early interest rate cut . . . could . . . backfire'. Between these two sage judgments we can read your leader writer's view ('The case for lower rates') that a prudent chancellor of the exchequer could justify 'a sharp cut in short-term rates'. Is this a record? Kit McMahon, 25 Whitehall, London SW1A 2BS</p>

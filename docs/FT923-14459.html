			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Dubai (10) - Start here and nowhere is hard to get to / Location has been an important factor in the emirate's development Nowhere is hard to get to from Dubai - which is hardly surprising given that Dubai's location betwixt Europe and the Far East has been one of the prime motors of its development, writes Mark Nicholson. Within the emirates itself, Dubai is 10 minutes' drive from Sharjah and a series of shortish hops thereafter to Ajman, Umm al Qaiwain and Ras al Khaimah. The Indian Ocean emirate of Fujairah is just an hour-and-a-half's drive over the mountains, while Abu Dhabi is two hours away by road to the south-west along what is perhaps the emirates' least impressive and most hazardous main route. The daily Emirates Air services shuttle from Dubai airport is less hair-raising, and would probably be even if undertaken in a Sopwith Camel. Muscat, the capital of Oman, is also within four hours' drive, but visitors will be allowed entry only on production of a No Objection Certificate. It is best sought well before leaving because obtaining one takes time to work through the bureaucracy. The same advice holds for all other Gulf states, all of which require visas for non-Gulf nationals. Most other Gulf states are best reached by air. Gulf Air, in which Abu Dhabi holds a stake, flies four times daily to Bahrain, twice a day to Doha and once to Muscat. Emirates Air flies twice daily to Kuwait City, as does Kuwait Airways. Saudia, the kingdom's carrier, has six flights a day to Riyadh, four to Jeddah and three to Dhahran, the oil centre on the east coast. Sanaa, Yemen's capital, can be reached four times a week with Yemenia. Iran Air flies twice weekly to Bandar Abbas and Tehran, as does Emirates, Dubai's carrier. Both also fly to Shiraz at least once weekly. For all trips in and around the Gulf, it is worth checking the Moslem calendar, since flights tend to book solid in the days just before and just after the main Eid holidays in the first half of the year. Further-flung destinations are if anything even better served. The huge number of Asian and Indian expatriates in Dubai, combined with its traditional place as a fuelling stop for European-Asian flights means that there are several daily flights to most big Indian and Pakistani cities, Singapore, Hong Kong and, though slightly fewer, to Tokyo. Most big European cities are similarly well served and from July Emirates is to add Paris, Rome and Zurich to its European stops. Dubai is replete with travel agents. The biggest is the Dubai National Air Travel Agency, headquartered in the vast Airline Centre off the main airport road. to the airport. DNATA is the main agent for 25 of the 55 airlines which use Dubai International airport. House of Travel, a Kuwaiti-owned business, also offers a 24-hour booking service and associated car hire and hotel bookings.</p>

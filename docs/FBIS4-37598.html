			<p>BFN     [Text] Jibril al-Rujub, who is head of Palestinian  security in the self-rule area, says Yasir 'Arafat will not come  to Gaza and Jericho before the middle of next month. The reason  for this is that the countries pledging aid to the autonomous  regions appear to be in no hurry to make good their pledges for  establishing an infrastructure in the areas. Al-Rujub said also  that the issue of the release of Palestinian prisoners and IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] security procedures at checkpoints were  contributing to 'Arafat's decision to delay his departure. The  Palestinian security chief pointed to recent incidents involving  PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th. Al-Rujub said Sha'th was delayed  twice at IDF security barriers and only allowed to move on after  the deputy chief of staff intervened.</p>

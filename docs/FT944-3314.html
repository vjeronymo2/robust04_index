			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Court ban on naming of lottery winner Camelot, the National Lottery operator, was last night granted a High Court injunction preventing Mirror Group or News International from naming the winner of last Saturday's Pounds 17.9m lottery jackpot. The legal action was taken after both the Daily Mirror and The Sun had almost certainly discovered the identity the winner of the largest amount ever won in the UK. The winner, a factory worker in the north of England with three children, had opted for anonymity as is his right under the rules of the National Lottery. The newspapers said last night that they had not been intending to publish the winner's identity in today's newspapers but that they intended to challenge the ex parte injunction, which remains in force until next Tuesday, at the earliest possible opportunity. Under the rules set by the National Lottery office the privacy of winners receives strong protection if that is what they want. Unlike football pools winners, who have to opt for privacy, National Lottery winners have an automatic right of privacy until they opt for publicity in front of a witness. The excitement over last Saturday's jackpot, and the near inevitability of the winner's identity becoming common knowledge, raises questions about how practical the privacy rule will turn out to be. In many US lotteries winners are not allowed to remain secret to ensure fair play. On Monday, when a number of newspapers offered rewards for finding the multi-million winner, Mr Ian Sproat, the National Heritage minister, suggested that complaints about unfair behaviour by newspapers could go to the Press Complaints Commission. On Monday night The Sun and the Daily Mirror withdrew rewards of Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 5,000 respectively for identifying the winner. Though it is very unlikely a newspaper will name the jackpot winner while the injunction is in place, more and more details of the lifestyle and character of the person are likely to emerge.</p>

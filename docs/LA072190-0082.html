			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> MAYOR CATLIN HOME AFTER BEACH WIPEOUT  </P> <P> Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin has been released from the hospital, nearly a month  after he suffered a spinal cord injury while body surfing.  </P> <P> The 71-year-old mayor said he will continue to undergo physical therapy at St.  Jude Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in Fullerton.  </P> <P> The accident left Catlin with partial paralysis in his hands and feet, but he  indicated doctors expect a complete recovery.  </P> <P> "I received a bruise on my spinal cord," said Catlin, who has to use a cane to  get around. "I'm still walking with a limp. And I'm trying to get back control  of my feet and hands through exercise and therapy."  </P> <P> Catlin said he had been body surfing in Laguna Beach and was heading back to  shore when the accident happened.  </P> <P> "The wave hit me and drove me into the sand," he said, recounting the June 21  accident.  </P> <P> "I couldn't move my feet or hands, and I was under about 1 1/2 feet of water. I  could see the surface, but I couldn't move."  </P> <P> Catlin credited his wife and a friend, Carol Howard, with saving his life.  </P> <P> "I couldn't hold my breath any longer, and I thought for sure I was a goner,"  he said. "The next thing I felt were these hands grabbing me and pulling me  ashore."  </P> <P> Catlin said he is keeping busy by doing city work and preparing for his  reelection campaign this fall. "I'll still be able to make key City Council  meetings, and I'm signing papers at home."  </P> <P> Mayor Pro Tem Chris Norby has been filling in for Catlin since the accident.  </P> <P> "The one thing I'll remember about this whole thing is the cards and letters  from concerned people. You'd think I was George Bush or something," Catlin  said, laughing. ERIK HAMILTON  </P></p>

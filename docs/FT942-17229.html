			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: A cure for Russia's ills that is marred by errors of analysis Sir, Jeffrey Sachs (Personal View, March 31) urges, as some of us have for a long time, that the G7 should get involved more substantively in Russia's economic transformation. But his article is marred by the errors of analysis and judgment that led to his policy failure in Russia. Wildly improbable demands for aid, matching substantial 'shock-therapy' targets to slash the Russian budget deficit swiftly and sharply (as announced and attempted in early 1992), have been the hallmark of Sachs's failed approach. The assertion that only an immediate and huge commitment of Dollars 28bn will work in Russia is a reflection of that fallacy. A gradual but firm attack on budget deficits, matched by smaller external support that is increased as Russian stabilisation efforts are seen to be credible and gathering momentum, is surely more realistic. Indeed, the greater cohesion of the Chernomyrdin administration and the prime minister's recent reformist decisions make this a credible policy scenario. Sachs chastises the International Monetary Fund for rejecting his view that only a fixed exchange rate anchor (supported presumably by a huge aid commitment) would work in stabilising Russia financially. But he fails to persuade. Despite his contrary assertion, the evidence on the question is mixed. The IMF is correct in arguing that domestic financial discipline is the critical problem: fixed exchange rates will not guarantee it and, combined with indiscipline, will leave Russia hopelessly indebted as the larger aid sums are dissipated. Sachs alienated the Chernomyrdin government by politically siding with the Gaidar-Fyodorov group and attacking Chernomyrdin in the media in fiercely undiplomatic ways when it was widely assumed that the former group would win power in the December elections. He has alienated the IMF, whose policies he has roundly attacked and whose managing director he has called upon to resign. He would now like the G7 to impose his inappropriate agenda on Russia. The G7 can do no better than to say: no thanks. Padma Desai, Gladys and Roland Harriman professor of comparative economic systems, Columbia University, New York, NT 10027, US</p>

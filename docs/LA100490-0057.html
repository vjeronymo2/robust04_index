			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> 'DIATRIBE' ON GRAND JURY  </P> <P> The scurrilous outburst in a letter of Aug. 5 aimed at the 1989-90 Ventura  County Grand Jury, apparently written by labor organizer Barry Hammitt, can  actually have one beneficial result.  </P> <P> People may be stimulated to read the 1989-90 grand jury reports, especially the  report on substance abuse, which seemed to be the major cause of this peculiar  outburst.  </P> <P> Readers should be making their own judgments about significant matters  discussed in the reports in order to form their own opinions.  </P> <P> As with any institution, even the 1,000-year-old grand jury system, review and  reanalysis are always essential and vital to a democracy. I may, with  apologies, refer to my own analysis, which was published in the July 11 issue  of the News Chronicle of Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> Constructive change, however, is always the result of quiet reflection and  civilized exchanges of views, not of explosive diatribes.  </P> <P> L. EDWARD SHUCK  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks  </P> <P> Shuck was foreman pro tem of the 1989-90 Ventura County Grand Jury and chairman  of its Health, Education and Welfare Committee.  </P></p>

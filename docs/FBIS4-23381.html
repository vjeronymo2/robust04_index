			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] In Djibouti, a demonstration in the Afar  district of Arhiba was violently repressed by the police this  morning. [passage omitted]    Djama Elabe, the chairman of the Party for Democratic  Renewal, is outraged at what happened. He has condemned the  intervention of the police. Listen to him:    [Begin Djama Elabe recording] Under the pretext of  dislodging  people from anarchic [as heard] buildings, the government today  used what I would call provocation. They used tanks; they used  an entire army. They dislodged these people. As you know, most  of these people are people who have been displaced because of  war. They came from Obock. They live near this district.    Instead of solving the problems and helping people to settle  in a home again and restoring peace, tanks and the army are sent  to dislodge people and we strongly condemn what happened today.  Many people were wounded. We have even been told that people  had died.    We condemn the attitude of the government which is currently  losing control. Over the last few days, we have witnessed  attitudes....[pauses] It really seems that the government is  experiencing physical fear because everything is getting out of  hand. They have destroyed the country politically,  economically, socially, and it now seems that they are  destroying men and women as well. It is in order to hide their  political failure, in order to restore hatred between people,  and to divide our people. [end recording]    That was Djama Elabe. It must also be pointed out that the  chairman of the United Djibouti Opposition Front, Mohamed Ahmed  Issa, also known as Cheiko, was arrested at his home this  evening.</p>

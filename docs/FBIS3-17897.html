			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Major General S.I. Syedin, professor and </F> doctor of psychology, by unidentified correspondent; date and  place not given; from the "Aty-Baty" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] Sergey Ivanovich, you have devoted  your entire life to the armed forces, in particular to military  psychology. In recent years you headed the military psychology  faculty at the Humanitarian Academy of the Armed Forces. What  prospects do you see for military psychology in particular, and  the use of psychology in the armed forces in general, while  major reforms are being carried out in the army?    [Syedin] You cannot include military psychology among those  sciences that make up the armed forces' methodological basis of  construction. At the same time, we note that the armed forces  cannot be built without military psychology. The historical  experience of the Russian Army's development prior to 1917  indicates great attention was always paid to the mental state of  servicemen. There was even a society of devotees of military  affairs which published a magazine centered mainly on military  psychology.    Presently, every unit has a psychologist, as do formations  and groups. However, in my opinion the problem of creating a  social and psychological service, and of the psychological  system as a whole, has not been completely solved.    [Correspondent] Do the people who have been appointed as  unit and formation psychologists fulfill the requirements in  terms of their professional training? What is your opinion?    [Syedin] In answering this question and discussing this  issue, I would like to relate what the purely official  understanding of a psychologist is. In my opinion, a military  psychologist is an officer who occupies the position and who has  a state-approved diploma as a psychologist. As it turns out,  presently the positions of psychologists are occupied by people  who do not fully meet these requirements.    Personally, I have always supported the idea that any job  should be done by a professional. The professional should know  the results of his actions and work, and should predict its  outcome. Much is presently being said and written about  psychotropic weapons and making zombies out of people  [zombirovaniye]. But these are still unresearched  manifestations. I do not want to dispute it, but at the same  time I would not like to see those who are professionally  untrained dabbling in it.    [Correspondent] Presently, a large number of young men,  former servicemen or active duty servicemen who have experienced  extreme situations or participated in combat, have accumulated  in our armed forces and state in general. Could military  psychologists organize some form of assistance, some form of  psychotherapeutic rehabilitation, for them? Can something be  done for them along these lines today?    [Syedin] Our department has studied the experience of  psychological rehabilitation abroad. The U.S. armed forces have  a wealth of experience in this area. We know about the problems  of Vietnam war veterans, and that there are 196 centers in the  United States for the psychological rehabilitation of war  veterans and their families.    In our armed forces, and in associated public services such  as various committees for the social defense of servicemen and  members of their families, this kind of purpose-oriented work is  not carried out. At the same time, practical work by the staff  and teachers of our department shows that to a great extent  military psychology, particularly the psychology of a  humanitarian, is capable of doing achieving this.</p>

The existing FTS2000 contracts will expire in 1998. As a part of the continuing, open discussion related to the post&hyph;FTS2000 provision of telecommunications services to Federal government users, the government hereby advises interested parties of the following opportunities to participate in this discussion. The government released a report entitled, ``Post&hyph;FTS2000 Acquisition Alternatives White Paper'' on April 29, 1994. The report addresses the solicited submissions from industry and other parties regarding the various approaches available for provisioning telecommunications services for the post&hyph;FTS2000 environment. This report was prepared, as a framework for further study, by the Acquisition Working Group, a subcommittee of the Interagency Management Council. At present, the government plans that the report will be available for public viewing in the General Services Administration Bid Room and electronically via the Internet (see below for access information). The government also plans to make available at these sites other post&hyph;FTS2000 documents, including the report entitled, ``Networking for a Reinvented Government: Federal Telecommunications Requirements and Industry Technology Assessment.'' The government will accept clarification questions on the alternatives enumerated in the above report through May 31, 1994. Clarification questions may be submitted to General Services Administration, Attention: Concept Development Record, 7980 Boeing Court, Vienna, Va 22182&hyph;3988. It is preferred that clarification questions be submitted electronically to the Internet address, cdr@post.fts2k.gsa.gov. The government will provide responses to the clarification questions on or about July 1, 1994. At present, the government plans that the responses will be available for public viewing in the General Services Administration Bid Room and electronically via the Internet (see below). The government also plans to make available to interested parties an analysis report of the various acquisition alternatives on or about August 12, 1994. The government will accept written comments on the alternatives report and the analysis report through September 23, 1994. Written comments may be submitted to General Services Administration, Attention: Concept Development Record, 7980 Boeing Court, Vienna, VA 22182&hyph;3988. It is preferred that comments be submitted electronically to an Internet address of cdr@post.fts2k.gsa.gov. The government also intends to invite verbal summaries, based on the written comments received prior to August 30, 1994, to be presented before a Government Panel consisting of members of the Interagency Management Council on September 13, 14, and 15, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The times and locations of these sessions will be announced on or about July 29, 1994.

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - The World's Economies (51): Roller-coaster levels out - Japan / The economy has matured since the roaring 80s The world's second largest economy, emerging from the longest recession since the war, has grown slower and more mature than it was in the roaring 1980s. Japan's previous recessions came as the result of external shocks, which inflicted shallow downturns followed by steep recoveries. The latest downturn in the economy, following the collapse of a bubble of high asset prices at the turn of the decade, has its origins in several structural weaknesses. They suggest that this recovery will be gentler than previous ones. Just as Japan's underlying rate of growth slowed after the 1970 oil shock and the early 1980s' downturns, so has this latest recession sapped a little of its economic vitality. The range of economic forecasts in Tokyo is for gross domestic product to recover from stagnation last year, to growth of something under 1 per cent or up to 2 per cent this year, settling to one or two points below the 1980s' average annual growth rate of 4.5 per cent. Japan may only walk rather than run through this recovery, but few doubt that the worst is over. The main evidence for an upturn includes a 3.9 per cent annualised increase in GDP in the first quarter of this year, the best performance for three years. On top of this, the Bank of Japan's latest Tankan economic survey in May, the most reliable indicator of the short-term outlook, shows the first improvement in business confidence for five years. Of course, the economy could well weaken in the summer, for the same reasons as last year. As in 1993, a government collapse has been followed by a steep rise in the yen. But the latest yen appreciation was, at the time of writing, not as sharp as last summer's, while the forces supporting the economy are more widespread this year than they were last. Four government spending packages, totalling Y45,000bn over the past two years, plus a Y6,000bn income tax rebate this year, have started to take effect. This is shown in strong rises in housing starts, private consumption and imports. The yen's sharp rise may squeeze industry's export earnings, but it has also helped spur domestic demand, shown in a 7.6 per cent rise in imports in the first six months of the year and a 5.8 per cent rise in private consumption in the first quarter. Japanese consumers, enriched by their strong currency, have flocked to discount stores, which are often loaded with cheap imported goods. Industry has at the same time started to reduce its vast inventories of unsold goods, while industrial production has shown signs of improvement. Output showed an apparently encouraging rise during the first three months of this year by comparison with the last quarter of 1993. Individual monthly figures have switched direction every month since last August, so the upturn in production is not yet conclusive. Looking beyond the immediate problems, the later stages of the recovery may be constrained by three structural problems, deflation, surplus industrial capacity and the weakness of the financial system. The flood of cheap imports has helped depress prices, so that the official measure of consumer price inflation is just under 1 per cent. This does not, however, include discount stores, so underlying consumer price inflation may be more in line with the 2 per cent decline in wholesale prices, in which case Japan's real interest rates look higher than those of the US. An additional danger is that falling prices might squeeze company profits more than they stimulate demand. Surplus capacity will at the same time force the industries that used to be the engines of Japan's economy to hold down wage increases, new employment and investment in the mature domestic market. The car industry alone, for example, still has surplus production capacity of 2m vehicles, equivalent to the entire car market of Britain or France. The electronics, shipbuilding, engineering and financial services industries are also going into this recovery with excess staff. This means that Japanese companies will continue, as they did in the recession, to curb recruitment and to encourage early retirement, as a way to continue bringing down their break-even points without breaking the taboo against heavy redundancies. They can also be expected to accelerate the shift in capacity to cheaper production sites in other Asian countries, the fastest growing destination for new Japanese investment and exports. According to a recent survey by the ministry of international trade and industry, Japanese companies will increase capital investment by 1.1 per cent in the year to next March, yet most of this new cash will go to the rest of Asia, which will double its share of Japan's overall foreign investment to 37.5 per cent. The financial system, meanwhile, is making slow headway in running down the burden of bad debts, inherited from the boom in lending on the back of over-valued property during the sharp rise in asset values of the late 1980s. Since then, commercial property prices have fallen by up to 50 per cent and have shown no clear sign yet of recovery. The fear is the experience has made banks so cautious over extending new loans that the economic recovery may prove hard to finance. This is borne out by the weak performance of the benchmark indicator of money supply, M2 plus certificates of deposit. It turned the corner early last year, from a three-year decline, but grew at a mere 1.5 per cent in the year to June, well below the 5 per cent annual growth which many economists believe is needed to fund a revival.</p>

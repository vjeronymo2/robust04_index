			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUDI SALES STILL WEAK, DESPITE FEDERAL REPORT THAT CAR IS SAFE  </P> <P> In November, 1986, CBS' "60 Minutes" ran a story saying that Audi's upscale  cars had a tendency to suddenly, and dangerously, accelerate.  </P> <P> Audi hasn't been the same since.  </P> <P> That 1986 report sent the West German auto maker's sales into an immediate  tailspin, despite the fact that there was never any conclusive evidence of a  technical problem. From a 1985 peak of more than 73,000 cars, Audi's U.S. sales  plunged to fewer than 23,000 last year.  </P> <P> Finally, in July, the federal government, which had investigated the sudden  acceleration charges, cleared Audi in a major report, concluding that the  problem resulted from driver error.  </P> <P> The report said there was nothing wrong with Audi cars and that drivers were  guilty of "pedal misapplication," meaning they had inadvertently stepped on the  accelerator and were blaming the cars for their mistakes. Similar findings were  released earlier in the year by the governments of Canada and Japan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Slight Rise in Sales  </P> <P> For Audi, the news provided a measure of vindication; Audi trumpeted the  conclusions of the federal report in an advertising blitz, titled "Case  Closed," as soon as the findings were released.  </P> <P> But the reports seem to have come too late to help Audi, the luxury car  division of Volkswagen, regain the bulk of its lost customers. Sales have risen  slightly in recent months, but they remain woefully behind the levels Audi  posted before the "60 Minutes" broadcast.  </P> <P> For one thing, the report clearing Audi has received far less media coverage  than the earlier allegations of safety defects. As a result, Audi's most  critical asset -- its image among America's most affluent and selective car  buyers -- has yet to recover.  </P> <P> In addition, the company's dealership network has been decimated during the  past three years, further limiting the company's potential for increased sales.  Today, Audi has 53 fewer dealers than it did in 1986 and fewer than 400 dealers  overall.  </P> <P> Still, Audi officials remain hopeful that they can now turn things around.  "There's been a tremendous boost in the confidence of our organization since  the (federal) report came out," says Tony Kirton, Audi's U.S. marketing  director. "Now, in fairly short order, we think we can become a significant  player again in the luxury car group."  </P> <P> But industry analysts aren't so sure. For one thing, the luxury market has  become far more competitive since Audi's public relations crisis began three  years ago. Now, instead of just facing other European luxury makes, Audi must  do battle with the sophisticated, upscale Japanese cars coming from the new  luxury divisions of Tokyo's Big Three -- Honda's Acura line, Toyota's Lexus  cars and Nissan's new Infiniti models.  </P> <P> "I think it will be extremely difficult for Audi to ever get back to where they  were," says William Pochiluk, founder of Autofacts, a Paoli, Pa., automotive  market research firm.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Revamped Models  </P> <P> But that's not to say Audi hasn't been trying hard to win back customers. Soon  after the "60 Minutes" report, the company offered the largest rebate in the  car industry's history -- $5,000 -- to any Audi owner willing to trade in for a  new one.  </P> <P> Today, the company continues to offer a comprehensive and unique warranty  program that pays for all types of regular maintenance on leased vehicles, even  down to the purchase of new wiper blades and replacement oil.  </P> <P> Audi has also moved to revamp its lineup in an effort to develop a fresh image.  </P> <P> Most notably, Audi has changed the name of its troubled 5000 series -- the  prime target of the sudden acceleration charges. In the 1989 model year, the  Audi 5000 was modified and renamed the Audi 100, while the Audi 5000 turbo was  altered and renamed the Audi 200. The company's Quattro series has also  undergone a drastic realignment, with a high-performance, V-8-equipped version  available this fall.  </P> <P> Such actions have led to modest sales gains in recent months -- enough to  persuade Audi officials that the hemorrhaging may finally have ended. Indeed,  sales in early September are showing a 54% gain from the same period in August.  "This is very, very encouraging to us," says Bert Triller, Audi's Los  Angeles-based Pacific zone manager.  </P> <P> Now, with a 1990 sales forecast of 32,000 units, Audi is counting on its first  year-to-year improvement since the "60 Minutes" report.  </P> <P> The company's crisis "certainly forced us to be creative," notes Kirton. "When  you come out of something like this, you realize you came out stronger."  </P></p>

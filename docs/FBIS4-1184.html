			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 25 SAPA -- At least two people  were killed and 30 injured in a bomb blast at a Germiston taxi  rank on the East Rand on Monday [25 April] morning. However, an  East Rand police official earlier said seven people were killed  according to someone who was on the scene of the 8.45 AM blast  at the taxi rank on the corners of Odendaal and Simpson Streets.    East Rand police spokesman Capt Wikus Weber said extensive  structural damage was caused in the immediate vicinity of the  blast and human remains could be seen from the nearby Trust Bank  building.    Four minibuses were severely damaged. An area about 100 m  [meters] around the scene of the explosion was cordoned off.  The injured were taken to the William Cruywagen,  Boksburg/Benoni and Natalspruit hospitals.    The type of explosives used was unknown, but experts on the  scene were sifting though the debris for clues. No-one had  claimed responsibility and police said they were not warned  about the blast.    Congress of SA Trade Unions [COSATU] Spokesman Neil Coleman  said the Germiston blast took place "right outside" a COSATU  sub-regional office in the East Rand city.    The series of blasts which started with a huge car bomb in  central Johannesburg on Sunday was clearly a co-odinated attack  on the ANC and its allies in the run-up to the election, said Mr  Coleman. He urged police to take immediate action to ensure the  safety of people using or finding themselves near premises  occupied by the ANC and its allies.    "A start could be made by clearing all cars within a certain  radius from buildings used by our allies," Mr Coleman said. Mr  Coleman added information reaching COSATU indicated the  Germiston blast was a car bomb. [Johannesburg SAPA in English at  0907 GMT on 25 April reports that "at least eight people died  and 33 were injured in a bomb blast at a Germiston taxi rank on  the East Rand on Monday morning, police confirmed."]</p>

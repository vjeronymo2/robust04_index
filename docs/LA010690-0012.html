			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEST-AND-WORST LIST GETS A FEW ADDITIONS  </P> <P> Larry Stewart was 99.9% correct. I reserve the other .1% because he omitted Ken  Brett. Brett can be informative for a spell, but when he was relieving Al Conin  for a spell, I didn't have the foggiest idea where the ball was going or what  happened until I read the paper the next day.  </P> <P> JOHN A.

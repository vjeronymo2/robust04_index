			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AAA SEES 2% DROP IN LABOR DAY WEEKEND TRAVEL  </P> <P> Labor Day weekend travelers will be taking the summer's last fling on the most  expensive fuel in years, and travel experts say some may just decide to stay  home.  </P> <P> The American Automobile Assn. expects a 2% decline in air, train, bus and car  travel from last year -- partly because of rising gasoline prices after Iraq's  invasion of Kuwait and partly because of an economic downturn that predates the  Middle East crisis.  </P> <P> The AAA, based in Heathrow, Fla., says an estimated 25.5 million Americans are  expected to travel 100 million miles by all modes of transportation during the  three-day weekend.  </P> <P> Its survey of gas prices showed a plentiful supply, with unleaded regular  averaging $1.30 a gallon. It also indicated that motorists are paying $2 to $4  more to fill up an average car's tank.  </P> <P> That should not be enough to affect long-planned trips, said AAA spokesman  Jerry Cheske, but he said some people who travel on impulse may have second  thoughts.  </P> <P> Air travel is not expected to be significantly affected by the increase in jet  fuel prices, because most travelers purchased tickets before the Kuwait  invasion, said Philip Davidoff, president-elect of the American Society of  Travel Agents.  </P> <P> Airlines have announced some fare increases, but many rolled them back to keep  planes filled.  </P></p>

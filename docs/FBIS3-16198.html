Only localized positional fighting is  continuing at various spots.    It appears that having suffered considerable losses during  their latest attacks, the Armenian side again wants to return to  the negotiating table. The Azerbaijani Armed Forces favor a  cease-fire and are ready to ensure the necessary conditions for  peace talks.</p>

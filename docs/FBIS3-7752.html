			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 28 Feb (EFE) -- The Srpska armed forces  today stated that the four planes which were downed by U.S.  fighters at 0545 GMT today near Banja Luka, the largest Serbian  city in Bosnia, were not Serbian.    Neboysa Radmanovic, press chief of Banja Luka, a city 232 km  north of Sarajevo, told the journalists that no Serbian military  planes took off today.    The press office of the Bosnian (Muslim) Third Army Corps  confirmed that Croatian planes today bombed the Brastvo factory  in Travnik, central Bosnia, and observers do not rule out the  possibility that these were the planes that were later downed.    Most observers seem to agree that the downed planes belonged  to the Bosnian Serbs, but they do not rule out the possibility  that they may be part of the small number of Croatian planes.  Serbian and Croatian pilots have been trained at the same  schools and use the same type of planes in the now extinct  Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.    The U.S. fighter planes carried out their operation against  the Yugoslav-made Galeb (swallows) training planes, in keeping  with Resolution 816 of the UN Security Council dated 1 March  1993.    This resolution, which received 14 votes in favor while only  the PRC abstained, allows the Security Council to begin the  so-called "Closed Sky" operation against Bosnian-Serb planes.    Since the Croats and the Muslims virtually have no planes,  the some 45 Serb planes and helicopters which usually use the  Banja Luka airport in northern Sarajevo, own the sky.    The United Nations has thus authorized NATO to continuously  overfly Bosnian territory with permission from President Alia  Izetbegovic, the only person the United Nations recognizes as a  representative of divided Bosnia.</p>

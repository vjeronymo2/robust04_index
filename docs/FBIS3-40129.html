Below, I will discuss several views on these  topics based on the spirit of the provincial CPC committee's  study.    I. Dialectically Analyzing the Situation, Using  Summarization of Experiences as Basis for Further Strengthening  of Confidence About Acceleration of Development    Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory about building a  distinctively Chinese brand of socialism and the spirit of the  Fourteenth CPC Committee, during 1993 the people of the entire  province emancipated thinking, rallied spirits, and seized  opportunities. Enthusiasm for accelerating development runs very  high, and reform and opening to the outside world, and  modernization have entered a new stage. Throughout the province,  the political situation is stable, society is moving ahead, and  the economy is running well. In reviewing the year's work, the  following matters are of rather profound significance:    First is taking a firm grip on the crucial matter of  emancipating thinking to change ways of thinking, promoting a  transformation of ideas, and spurring work overall. The 8th  Plenary Session of the 5th Provincial CPC Committee convened in  1992 highlighted the emancipation of thinking to change ways of  thinking. It linked ideological realities with work realities,  suggested the need to intensify study to comprehend Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's important remarks and the spirit of the 14th Party  Congress, maintained the unity of the emancipation of thinking  and the seeking of truth from facts, changed attitudes about  resignation to poverty, insulation and conservatism, and  traditional planned economy concepts as well as isolated and  lopsided ways of thinking. It increased awareness of the need to  forge ahead, awareness of the need to innovate, market economy  awareness, and dialectical awareness of being responsible for  the overall situation. The entire province, from top to bottom,  conscientiously implemented the spirit of this conference. Their  understanding of the theory of building a distinctively Chinese  brand of socialism and the basic line of the party deepened;  their awareness of the need for wholehearted attention to the  economy increased; their horizons broadened and they tried more  methods. After the Central Committee prepared a policy for  intensifying and improving macroeconomic regulation and control,  all levels and all government departments proceeded from  realities to gain a profound understanding of the importance of  and necessity for Central Committee policies. They fully  realized that correct macroeconomic regulation and control is  indispensable to the acceleration of development and for  positive solution to existing problems. At the same time, they  clearly understood and acted on the favorable opportunities that  the Central Committee's policies provide an agricultural and  resources-rich province such as ours. They diligently studied  how to develop in a situation of intensified and improved  macroeconomic regulation and control, both overcoming the abuses  of the "large common pot" of the traditional planned economy  system in which everyone benefitted no matter their  contribution. They also guarded against the problems stemming  from decentralization in a market economy, thereby enabling the  economy of the whole province to maintain a both rapid and good  development momentum.    Second is resolutely putting into effect the idea that  "development is the only assurance, making every effort to seize  opportunities to accelerate development." Working from a  foundation of further emancipation of thinking, the 9th Plenary  Session of the 5th Provincial CPC Committee convened in April.  It stressed the need to cherish and seize the favorable  opportunity provided by Comrade Xiaoping's important remarks and  the spirit of the 14th Party Congress to further clarify battle  objectives in an effort to open up new economic growth points  and to move Anhui's economy a new step upward. Bearing in mind  the goal of rural villages attaining a comfortable well-off  standard of living, the session conducted a lengthy discussion  to clarify specific criteria for a comfortable well-off standard  of living at all levels. Consequently, a comfortable well-off  standard of living became even more a real activity of rural  cadres and masses. A number of economic growth points having  rather strong vitality are in process of taking shape rapidly. A  number of infrastructure projects in the communications and  transportation fields, as well as energy, and raw and processed  materials projects have been completed and have gone into  production one after another. The province's overall economic  strength has increased markedly. One might say that 1993 has  been the year of most rapid growth and best development since  the advent of reform and opening up to the outside world.    Third is maintenance of the intensification of reform  as a means of solving contradictions and problems in moving  ahead to win positive results. In the cities, the emphasis  is on the key task of transforming the operating mechanisms of  state-owned enterprises, continuation of the implementation of  the "Regulations," diligent transformation of government  functions, more rapid straightening out of equity relationships,  and boldly running pilot projects on various forms of operation  including state ownership with civilian operation, public  ownership with private operation, leasing, mergers and  annexations, and bankruptcies from which fairly good results  have been obtained. In particular, fairly rapid progress has  been made in promoting the joint-stock system. Rural villages  have seen the widespread application of the township and town  enterprise joint-stock cooperation system. Pilot projects for  reform of the land and household registration control system  have been actively run to encourage and support the shift into  non-agricultural industries of surplus rural manpower. Major  efforts have been put into the fostering of rural markets to  improve rural socialized services. These measures have played a  positive role in promoting restructuring of the rural economy,  in increasing peasant income, and in improving the basic  position of agriculture. At the same time, definite advances  have also been made in associated reforms of the commodity  circulation system, social security, housing, and medical care  to lay the groundwork for solving deep-seated incongruities in  economic life.    Fourth is unflagging attention throughout to the  building of the party and the building of spiritual  civilization, greater efforts beginning to be made in both  regards.    In organizing party building and the building of spiritual  civilization, personnel turnover tasks were completed smoothly  at all levels. A large number of young cadres in the prime of  their life, who are politically steadfast, and who have done  yeoman service are moving up to new leadership positions to  infuse new vitality into leadership teams. They will help the  revamping of grassroots level organizations and the training of  grassroots cadres, and they will improve the fighting  capabilities of grassroots level organizations.    In the building of ideological work style, the study of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on the building of a  distinctively Chinese brand of socialism has been diligently  organized, and further concrete measures have been proposed for  improving the ideological work style of leadership teams. Ideas  have been formulated to improve party style and to build clean  government, and solid work has been done in carrying out a  battle against corruption. Since the second meeting of the  Central Disciplinary Committee, in particular, acting in  accordance with Central Committee demands and realities in our  own province, emphasis has been placed on four tasks, namely on  county-level and above leadership cadre honesty and  self-discipline, the investigation and punishment of large and  important cases, the eradication of the several unhealthy  tendencies that the masses most dislike, and eliminating the  diversion of public funds and the use of public funds to send  sons, daughters, and close friends to college. Preliminary  results have been achieved in these regards. Thanks to these  efforts, the ideological style and the work style of leadership  cadres has been changed anew. In the building of spiritual  civilization, ideological indoctrination about reform and  opening up to the outside world has been intensified, efforts  made to focus everyone's attention on accelerating development,  the entire province, from top to bottom further forming a  powerful cooperative force for wholehearted development of the  economy. To stir to the full the enthusiasm of all quarters, all  levels have made a great effort to protect the rights and  interests of the masses, and to safeguard political tranquility  and social stability. They have particularly concentrated their  energies on effective measures for solving some glaring problems  about which the reaction of the public has been intense, such as  excessive peasant burdens, delays in payment of teachers wages,  and poor social order in some places.    At the same time, we must clearly realize that many  difficulties and problems continue in our work at the present  time. We must give them a lot of attention and take positive  actions to solve them. In particular, we must solve them  conscientiously through the intensification of reform.    II. Use of Reform as the Main Theme in Accelerating the  Building of the Basic Framework for a Socialist Market Economy  System To Move the Province's Overall Strength a Step Upward    Seizing opportunities, accelerating development, and  concentrating energies on improving the building of the economy  is our steadfast policy. Today, Anhui is at a crucial period in  accelerating development. With hard work, it will succeed; if we  are lax, it will fail. We must clench our teeth, press on  without letup, and seize opportunities to move ahead. So long as  quality is good, markets exist, and a return can be made, we  should work at full tilt, doing all possible to seize the  initiative. Of course, our advocacy of faster development most  certainly does not mean "arbitrary uniformity." The differences  in economic development between one region and another have been  shaped by history, and the conditions for development are not  entirely the same. Places having the conditions for rapid  development must accelerate development. Where conditions do not  exist for the time being, we must not insist on competing, muich  less resort to deception about development. However, a maximum  effort must be made to create the conditions for gradual  acceleration of development. There positively must be no blaming  of objective conditions to cover up work shortcomings and  failure to try. At the same time, we must realize that  acceleration of development requires new approaches, genuinely  shifting to a new course in which restructuring and improving  returns are the centerpieces.    The coming year is a year of all-out promotion of reforms.  Numerous reform measures of great intensity will be inaugurated.  These reforms will mean a readjustment of interests in many  quarters. Complex situations and problems will be faced. Doing  effective work in every regard will not only have a bearing on  the smooth promotion of each reform, but on the stability of the  entire society as well. CPC committees and governments at all  levels must diligently study the Central Committees various  reform policies, thoroughly grasp their spirit, keep abreast of  favorable conditions in an overall way, make full preparations,  and do a solid job of carrying them out in an active and  well-founded way. In addition, we must create conditions  actively through our own efforts and effective work, work hard  in the pattern of new interest relations that reform has  brought, seek out greater development opportunities, and  accelerate our advance.    The overall guiding thought and requirements for work in the  coming year are: Taking Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory for the  building of a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism as a  guide, diligent implementation of the spirit of the 14th Party  Congress and of the 3d Plenary Session of the 14th Central  Committee; adherence to work in several directions at the same  time, further emancipation of thinking, seizing opportunities,  accelerating the pace of reforms in building a socialist market  economy system, widening opening up to the outside world,  maintaining a good momentum of rapid economic development even  while ensuring that quality is higher than in 1993 and that  returns will be better in 1994, promoting advance of overall  provincial strength to a new stage, and raising work in every  field to a new level.    1. Focus on the Building of a Modern Enterprise System,  Accelerate the Straightening Out of Equity Relationships, and  Concentrate Efforts on Invigorating State-Owned  Enterprises. Acceleration of the straightening out of  enterprise equity relationships, exploration of diversified ways  of operating assets, and genuinely enlivening enterprises to  enable steady increase in the value of assets, simultaneously  doing more to build a corps of entrepreneurs, and nurturing and  creating a large number of entrepreneurs that fit in with the  modern enterprise system are the keys to current intensification  of state-owned enterprise reform and the building of a modern  enterprise system. The building of a modern enterprise system  must proceed from realities. It must be tailored to different  kinds of enterprises and operating conditions, different ways  and means adopted. For large and medium state-owned enterprises,  the main task is a transformation from the former "plant system"  to a "corporation system." This is the main direction and task  in enterprise reform. In addition to transforming enterprises of  a monopoly character in accordance with the individual  proprietorship system, competitive enterprises must be  transformed according to the regular corporation system. Every  effort must be made to transform most state-owned enterprises  among basic industries, raw and processed materials industries,  processing industries, and tertiary industries into limited  liability corporations in which many shareholders hold shares.  When conditions are ripe, they may also be transformed into  joint-stock limited corporations. Demarcation lines between  industries and systems must be demolished, equity relationships  being used as the hub for organizing diverse forms of  corporation system enterprise blocs as economic development  inherently requires. Small state-owned enterprises must be  boldly decontrolled. Some may institute contract operation and  lease operation; others may be reorganized as stock-share  cooperation operations, or they may be sold to collectives or  individuals. Especially hard-hit enterprises that have serious  losses and whose assets are insufficient to defray liabilities  must be actively annexed or merged, auctioned off, or allowed to  go bankrupt. For the past several years, many places in the  province have been running pilot projects in these regards from  which heartening results have been obtained. Incomplete  statistics show that more than one-third of the nearly 300  money-losing enterprises in the province that have been annexed  or merged have begun to turn their losses into profits. Every  jurisdiction must diligently summarize and learn lessons from  these experiences, and apply them to their own situations. They  must further explore effective ways to straighten out equity  relationships. No matter the form or method, so long as it meets  the "three facilitates" standards, it may be courageously  adopted and actively practiced. At the county level in  particular, where most enterprises are medium or small, there  must be greater deregulation in an effort to make major  advances. Basic work must be done to straighten out enterprise  equity relationships. A priority task is reappraising the stocks  and assets of enterprises, defining equity rights, clarifying  credits and liabilities, appraising assets, and verifying the  amount of assets held by enterprise juridical entities.  Simultaneous with accelerated straightening out of equity  relationships and the promotion of diverse forms of operating  assets must be diligent attention to the implementation of  "Regulations on Changing the Operating Mechanisms of Industrial  Enterprises Under Ownership of the Whole People," and  "State-Owned Assets Supervision and Control Regulations." This  has as its purpose the improvement of enterprise administration  and management, guiding enterprises to condition their internal  operating system, accelerating enterprises' technological  transformation, and raising overall enterprise caliber.    Establishment and perfection of a modern enterprise system  is  not only a fundamental transformation of the microeconomic  economic base, but also has a bearing on complete and profound  changes in the macroeconomic system and the political system. It  requires comprehensive associated reform of the economic control  system, the market system, the legal system, and the social  security system. We must make people think more about the needs  of the overall situation, correctly handle readjustment of  equity relationships, and ensure implementation of all reform  measures. In 1994, reform of Anhui Province's government organs  will also get underway. Plans call for completion of reforms  over a 12-year period. Prior to the formal inauguration of the  implementation plans, all levels should pay close attention to  necessary preparations, taking real strides in further  transformation of government functions. They must continue to  use all means to place personnel in other jobs or assign them  elsewhere to create the conditions necessary for smooth  implementation of organization reform. After plans are formally  inaugurated, all jurisdictions must carefully organize for  active and soundly based action. Social security system reform  is lagging at the present time. It has become a prominent factor  limiting progress in enterprise reform. We must act within the  spirit of the "Decisions," gradually setting up a province-wide  centralized social security management organization, starting  with the cities, to hasten formation of a social security system  that covers all staff members and workers, that provides basic  protection, and that augments insurance. This will provide  support for enterprise reform and the free movement of manpower.    2. Focus on Attainment of the Goal of a Comfortable  Well-Off Standard of Living, Accelerating Restructuring of the  Rural Economy, and Concentrating on Increasing Peasant  Income. Development of China's rural economy today has  begun to enter a new stage in which restructuring and improved  returns are the main features. The overall approach in the  province's rural work during 1994 is to pursue the goal of a  comfortable well-off standard of living while stabilizing the  party's basic rural policies, adhering to a market orientation,  deepening rural economic system reform, hastening the  development of market agriculture, establishing a scientific and  effective macroeconomic regulation and control system,  lightening the peasants' burdens, genuinely protecting the  peasants' interests, and vigorously supporting the development  of agriculture. It is especially necessary to take a systems  engineering point of view, paying close attention to  accelerating structural readjustments, hastening the development  of township and town enterprises, speeding up the development of  "one premium and two highs" agriculture [i.e., premium products,  high yields, and high returns], and quickening the shift of  rural manpower into non-agricultural jobs. We must increase  peasant per capita income and improve the labor productivity  rate and the land output rate as important criteria for judging  the effectiveness of rural economic work. We must move the  province's rural economy toward the market, spur specialization  in agricultural production, and hasten progress townships and  villages development of market towns for further emancipation  and development of rural productivity. More than 80 percent of  the province's population lives in rural villages. Rapid  economic growth depends on opening up rural markets, but rural  markets can be opened up only if peasant income increases.  Therefore, everything from top to bottom requires increasing  peasant income to create more favorable conditions, steadily  increasing and applying investment in agriculture, increasing  building of agricultural infrastructure, and ensuring that  agricultural production and peasant income increase fairly  rapidly at the same time.    The initiation and promotion of a market economy provides  new  opportunities for rural development. It particularly provides a  good opportunity for our large agricultural province to move  toward the market. We must seize this opportunity, take the  market as our orientation, actively readjust the structure, and  devote major efforts to improving overall returns from  agriculture. We must select in a planned way places where  conditions are good and potential is high for the founding of a  number of demonstration zones and demonstration tracts that are  characterized by high yield, premium returns, and high returns  agriculture. We must invest science and technology, money, and  materials in them for the thorough development of varieties and  quality. Practice in many places shows that establishment of  analogous turnkey processing enterprises to give impetus to  steady readjustment of the agricultural structure and to promote  steady rise in peasant income is an effective way to develop the  rural economy. Every jurisdiction must actively develop dominant  industries and hot-selling products having a local flavor as  markets require and resources permit, using processing  industries and business concerns as a turnkey, using the  turnkeys to spur the development of bases, and using bases in  conjunction with peasant households for the formation of  specialized wholesale markets. This can bring about the  integration of trade, industry, and agriculture, and the  serialization of production, supply, and marketing. It can link  together the small-scale production of myriad households with  large markets in China and abroad to promote a pattern of  regionalization, a specialization of production, an integration  of operations, and a socialization of services to hasten  progress in the modernization of agriculture.    Township and town enterprises are important mainstays for  hastening the development of Anhui Province's economy. They  offer tremendous potential and hope for rural villages  realization of the goal of a comfortably well-off standard of  living. Although township and town enterprises in the province  have developed fairly rapidly during the past two years,  development has been very spotty. To a very large extent,  development has been pulled by the rise of "blank spots." We  have no reason at all to be complacent. Instead, we must clearly  realize the shortcomings that exist, and unflaggingly  concentrate and reconcentrate our attention on this problem.  While emphasizing the market and returns, we must accelerate  whatever can be accelerated, and turn our hands to whatever has  to be done, doing all possible to maintain the fine momentum of  rapid development of recent years. We must make sure that the  development of township and town enterprises proceeds in tandem  with the development of agriculture. We must actively start up  newly emerging industries as well, fully use and make the most  of our advantages in agricultural resources, vigorously develop  agricultural and sideline products processing industries, and  increase the farm products commercialization rate and added  value rate, thereby gradually shaping a new rural industrial  pattern based on developmental agriculture in which township and  town enterprises play a leading role. The province must provide  guidance tailored to individual circumstances. Places in which  development is relatively slow should continue to work toward a  rapid take-off. They should particularly make the elimination of  "blank villages" a main task to be completed within a certain  period. Places already having a foundation and requisite  conditions should concentrate on improving quality, raising  levels, and expanding scale. They should concentrate on  readjusting the structure and improving returns. They should  concentrate on developing away from extensive development toward  intensive development. In paying attention to the study of both  foreign and domestic markets, they should concentrate on  changing from looking outward rather than looking inward. One  point that must be noted, in particular, is that with changes in  the operating mechanisms of state-owned enterprises, the  existing flexible mechanisms in township and town enterprises no  longer hold the upper hand. Everyone will start from a single  line, in addition to which township and town enterprises will  generally not have as good technology, human talent, and  equipment as state-owned enterprises. Future development will  face greater difficulties. Therefore, township and town  enterprises should have a greater sense of crisis and a feeling  of pressure. They will have to be constantly creative in their  equity system and operating methods, guard against and overcome  degeneration of their operating mechanisms, intensify internal  control, vigorously promote technological transformation and  technical progress, seek to increase economic returns, and  increase their market competitiveness. They must move ahead  further with the stock-share cooperative system. They must use a  clarification of equity relationships as a foundation for  stimulating the flow and organization of the elements of  production across community lines to form a more rational  enterprise pattern. They must improve planning, bring about a  greater concentration of township and town enterprises, make  full use of and transform existing small cities and towns, and  build new small cities and towns. This is a successful road that  is in keeping with circumstances in the province. We must  steadily summarize experiences and accelerate the pace of  development.    The ability of large numbers of rural surplus manpower to  transfer elsewhere without a hitch is a strategic task that  affects attainment of the goal of a comparatively well-off  standard of living in rural villages. Every jurisdiction must  conscientiously study this matter. They must take effective  actions, and provide positive guidance to spur the rational and  orderly shift of manpower. They must strive to widen channels  for such shifts, vigorously develop developmental agriculture  and township and town enterprises, energetically develop rural  tertiary industries, organize and guide the outward movement of  labor in a planned way, and encourage and support peasants in  entering cities and towns to work and do business. The  separation of city and countryside must be eliminated, and the  household registration, labor employment and land control  systems reformed to provide support and services for the shift  of rural manpower.    Rural work consists of a multitude of things. Concentration  on agriculture, improvement of agriculture, and protection of  agriculture mean placing the work emphasis on "villages."  Villages are the most basic units and the most lively cells.  They are connected upward to everything, and they are a  convergence point downward for myriad households. They shoulder  the task of directly organizing the broad masses of people in  attainment of a comfortable well-off standard of living. Only  when close attention is paid to village level organization can  the party's various rural programs and policies truly move into  villages and households where they are put into practice and  have an effect. Party organizations at all levels, particularly  county and city CPC committees, must always make acceleration of  village-level economic development and better building of  village organization a major focus of rural work. They must  continue to expend much energy, restructuring, and improve  grassroots level organization, educate and train the broad  masses of grassroots cadres, and conscientiously build party  branches into the nucleus of village organization so that they  become leaders in directing the peasant's arduous innovation and  becoming wealthy together. Work is agricultural and in rural  villages is facing numerous new contradictions and new problems  today. Every jurisdiction must do more investigation and study  to solve them in a timely and well-founded way. Attention must  be paid to the livelihood of the rural masses, particular  attention given to solving difficulties in mountain regions and  impoverished areas to help the people there get out of poverty  and become wealthy more rapidly.    3. Focusing on Optimizing Resource Allocations,  Hastening Development of Production Elements Markets, and  Concentrating on Making Fullest Use of the Role of the Market  Mechanism. The basic role in market allocation of resources  must be premised on market prices. Today, prices of most  commodities have been decontrolled. The focus of continued  intensification of reform is on further acceleration of the  building of specialized markets and wholesale markets throughout  the province. While relying on the local fostering of a number  of regional commodity markets, the two-track pricing of means of  production has been abolished to bring into being more  production elements markets, and accelerate progress in markets  setting prices of the elements of production. Given conditions  in the province, during 1994, marked breakthroughs should be  made in the building of manpower and human talent markets,  science and technology and information markets, financial  markets, real estate markets, enterprise equity exchange  markets, and rural land use rights exchange markets. Close  attention must be paid to the development of various kind of  market middleman organizations, full use made of their service,  contacting, notarial, and supervisory roles to promote the  healthy development of market building.    Market competition is merciless, and a bipolarization of  enterprises is also unavoidable. It is too much to expect that  each and every one of the numerous state-owned enterprises will  be a winner and make a profit year after year. Survival of the  fittest must be genuinely applied to enterprises, the fittest  run well so that they develop more rapidly, and the least fit  eliminated to stimulate a new organization of the elements of  production. All jurisdictions must orient toward the market,  principal support going to the industries and products that  reflect the level of local economic development and that express  the distinctiveness of local economic development. Policies,  investment, and resources should favor them, and they should be  given priority for development to improve their competitiveness  in domestic and international markets, to widen avenues for  their development, and to obtain more marked economic returns,  thereby stimulating other industries and enterprises. Attention  must be given to market returns from name brand products,  development of the province's existing name-brand products  accelerated, and new name-brand and premium products produced  steadily. In addition, other enterprises should be encouraged to  forge links with enterprises manufacturing name-brand products,  and to register name-brand products, to try to widen market  share, and to seize the high ground in markets. At the same  time, continued efforts should be made to foster economic growth  points, and an all-out effort made to develop diverse forms of  ownership to increase the percentage of the non state-owned  economy. In some special areas where the level of productivity  is fairly low, in particular, it is even more necessary to  boldly emancipate thinking, free ourselves from restraints, and  accelerate development of the individual and privately owned  economy, and the three kinds of partially or wholly  foreign-owned enterprises to enable them to work with and  augment state-owned and collectively-owned enterprises for  mutual advance and common development.    4. Focus on the Formation of a Pattern of Opening in  All Directions To Accelerate the Pace of Opening to the Outside  World, Concentrating on Increasing the External Orientation of  the Economy. In a market economy, enterprises are both main  market entities and main entities for opening up to the outside  world. Large and medium enterprises that enjoy a relative  economic, technical, and human talent advantage should be  selected to lead the push into international markets, full use  made of their energizing and model roles. However, the number of  enterprises that have the strength to enter international  markets directly are few and far between. Most large and medium  enterprises will have to enter international markets indirectly  through the importation of foreign capital, the digestion and  assimilation of advanced technical equipment, and through  grafting and cooperation. Close attention must be given to study  and solution of some problems existing in three kinds of  partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises to help them  improve their operations, to increase returns, to improve their  administration according to law, and to protect their legal  rights and interests. In addition, the degree of openness must  be steadily increased, areas opened to the outside world  widened, efforts made to attract foreign capital at a higher  level and over a wider range, three new kinds of partially or  wholly foreign-owned enterprises developed energetically, and  old enterprises grafted and transformed on a large scale.    Reform of the external economic system must be intensified,  foreign trade expanding and permeating every trade and industry  for rapid formation of a large economic relations and trade  system that combines trade, industry, and agriculture; foreign  and domestic trade; trade inside and outside the province, and  the domestic and the foreign. In addition, corresponding banking  and finance, information, scientific and technical human talent,  insurance, and securities systems must be developed and put on a  sound footing to serve the development of foreign economic  relations and foreign trade. An all-out effort must be made to  open up international markets, to expand foreign trade bases, to  build strong product sales agencies, and production and  processing, storage, transportation, and service networks. This  will advance the multi-level, multi-component, multi-function,  internationally oriented development of foreign economic  relations and trade. Enterprises that produce for foreign trade,  and foreign economic relations and foreign trade government  units must use to the full and use flexibly applicable state  policies, make their own operating decisions, accept  responsibility for their own profits and losses, improve  management, lower exchange conversion costs, and increase  economic returns. They must further improve the investment  climate to improve service quality and operating efficiency, and  increase external publicity to increase Anhui's name  international recognition.    5. Focus on Promoting the Extension Into the Economy of  Science and Technology To Speed Up Development and Use of  Science and Technology, Concentrating on Improving the Science  and Technology Content of Products. A policy of  "stabilizing one end while opening up an expanse," must be  implemented to shape systems for the development of science and  technology, for research and development, and promotion.  Scientific research organs must orient toward the marketplace  and institute businesslike management to enliven their  mechanisms. Developmental and applied scientific research organs  must actively build scientific and technical enterprises devoted  primarily to high and new technology products. Except for a  small number of permanent scientific researchers receiving  support from the state, most personnel in public welfare  scientific research organs must work on matters related to  economic and social development. They must shift over to  scientific and technical development and improve their  self-development capabilities. The orientation of science and  technology toward the marketplace must be accelerated to spur  the commercialization of the fruits of scientific and technical  research. Enterprises must be willing to put up large amounts of  money to buy the fruits of scientific and technical research to  hasten the technological transformation and the technical  progress of enterprises. Scientific research units must use  channels of all kinds to introduce and sell the products of  their own scientific and technical research. They should look  for developmental projects by making technology transfers for  money, by calling for bids, and through auctioning to accelerate  their conversion into real productivity. Use of the current  favorable opportunity for transforming the joint-stock system,  using science and technology to acquire shares is a fine way to  advance the integration of science and technology with the  economy. It should be tried out boldly. We must make the most of  the province's strengths in science and technology and human  talent, and use preferential policies as an orientation for  building, as soon as possible, technical and information market  networks that link the province, prefectures, municipalities,  and counties vertically, and that link large institutions of  higher education, scientific research organs, and enterprises  laterally. We must develop intermediary organizations, augment  the number of scientific and technical brokers in order to do a  good job of building bridges for the transfer of the fruits of  technological research. The province's civilian-run scientific  research institutions have developed fairly rapidly in recent  years. They have made an important contribution to inculcating  science and technology into the economy, thereby exhibiting  exuberant vitality. We must provide them further support,  diligently assist them in solving difficulties, and promote  their steady development and growth.    We must pay close attention to the development of high and  new technology and associated industries, striving to break  substantial new ground by the end of the present century in  industrializing various technical fields including electronics,  information, and biological engineering. Every jurisdiction must  devote more energy to the support of projects having a high  scientific and technical content, but that do not yet exist on a  large scale. In the economic development zones, in particular,  every effort must be made to set up more high and new technology  enterprises. We must both develop and import at the same time,  practice the principle of "internalizing" imports, continue to  widen international academic exchanges, widen the scientific and  technical cooperation realm, and import both domestic and  foreign advanced scientific and technical achievements and  technical equipment. Although the development of high technology  poses certain risks, returns may also be quite high. We must  hasten the establishment and perfection of diverse scientific  and technical input systems, set up various funds including a  fund to reduce risks in scientific and technical development  that is primarily government funded to provide backstopping for  the industrialization of new and high technology.    Human talent is the carrier of science and technology, and  the training of human talent depends on education. Education  must orient toward the main battleground of building the economy  and toward the future. The training of human talent of a fairly  high scientific and cultural level and that understands  sophisticated work skills is the prime task. Acting in the  spirit of the Central Committee's educational reform and  development program, the provincial CPC committee and the  provincial government have made a decision about educational  reform and development problems in the province, the  implementation of which they will organize conscientiously.  During the first half of 1994, the provincial CPC committee and  provincial government will also render decisions about ordinary  educational reform and development problems. All jurisdictions  should pay close attention. They should strive for substantial  advances in making the nine-year compulsory education system  universal and in the elimination of illiteracy among youths for  early attainment of the "two basics" goal. The "Teachers' Law"  must be conscientiously implemented to ensure teacher benefits  according to law.    III. Intensifying Indoctrination, Mastery of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's Theory for Building a Distinctively Chinese  Brand of Socialism To Raise the Level of Leadership For Taking  Account of the Situation as a Whole    Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory for building a distinctive  Chinese brand of socialism carries on, enriches, and develops  Mao Zedong Thought. It is contemporary Chinese Marxism, and it  is our guide for action. Use of this scientific theory to arm  the whole party provides the underpinnings for enhancement and  improvement of Party leadership, for strengthening the party,  for moving ahead with reform and opening up to the outside  world, and for modernization. The degree to which this theory is  understood and applied determines the overall caliber of party  organizations at all levels and the level of leadership. We must  relate this theory to reform and development realities, and  diligently study it. We must strive to understand fully and put  into effect its basic Marxist standpoint, point of view, and  methods to improve awareness and resoluteness in implementing  the party's basic line. Right now, Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping should be diligently  studied in particular. Leading cadres at the county level and  above should take the lead in study, strive to understand the  spiritual substance, do a conscientious job of unifying thinking  about Comrade Xiaoping's theory and the spirit of the 14th Party  Congress, and about the "Decisions" of the 3d Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee, steadily raise the level of  leadership needed to deal with the overall situation in a  unified way and to better discharge the important historical  task of leading the building of a socialist market economy  system.    1. Study and Mastery of Comrade Xiaoping's Theory,  Persevering Further in the Ideological Line of Emancipating  Thinking and Seeking Truth in Facts. The emancipation of  thinking and the seeking of truth in facts are the quintessence  of Comrade Xiaoping's theory for building a distinctively  Chinese brand of socialism. They are an ideological line that  our party has upheld for a long time, and they are an important  prerequisite for our doing a good job. The emancipation of  thinking is a process of steady development. Old problems are  solved only to have new problems steadily appear. Therefore, the  emancipation of thinking is not something that can be done once  and for all. One must make new efforts as situations develop and  as reform intensifies. The emancipation of thinking and the  seeking of truth in facts are parts of a piece. Upholding the  oneness of the emancipation of thinking and the seeking of truth  in facts is to enhance dialectical awareness, and to hold fast  to practice, which is the first basic principle of Marxism so  that thinking conforms to reality, and subjectivity and  objectivity accord with each other. In leadership work, one very  important point is the need to use the standard of the "three  facilitates" to determine choices in actual work, to decide  whether to move ahead or pull back, and to judge the advantages  and disadvantages, gains and losses from all programs, policies,  plans, and methods. Leading cadres at all levels must be adept  at proceeding from their own realities under guidance of Central  Committee overall policies and plans. They must concentrate more  on finding the areas in which policies and plans can be linked  to realities, boldly practice, and perform their work  creatively. The broad masses of people are the main entity in  practice. They possess extreme creativeness and unbounded  wisdom. In recent years, we have effectively moved ahead with  work in every regard by adhering to the mass line, by respecting  the creative spirit of the masses, and by creating fresh  experiences through the timely summarization of the practice of  the masses. This is an extremely valuable experience. Leading  cadres at all levels must maintain high political enthusiasm and  continue to uphold and carry forward this fine work style. They  must more consciously steep themselves in the fervent practice  of the masses, learn from the masses, and learn lessons from  practice. Nowadays large numbers of good role models and "points  of light" are coming to the fore everywhere. We must make sure  to uncover and summarize their experiences, and spread them at  once.    2. Study and Master Comrade Xiaoping's Theory, Further  Maintaining the Policy of Working in Multiple Directions at the  Same Time and Working With Might and Main. We must  diligently increase propaganda and cultural work, and  ideological and political work to install the Party's basic  theories and basic line in everyone. We must attain the optimum  combination of the traditional moral excellence of the Chinese  people and the spirit of the times, shape an ideology that holds  a commanding position, and better channel the attention of the  broad masses toward reform and opening to the outside world, and  the building of the economy. We must raise high the banners of  patriotism, socialism, and collectivism, vigorously propagandize  the pioneering of causes through arduous effort and the fine  tradition of selfless devotion. We must propagandize the  advanced role models of helping people attain happiness, of  readiness to take up the cudgels for a just cause, and of aiding  the distressed and succoring those in peril. We must  particularly improve the education of youth. We must actively  advocate a life style of having a correct view of life and a  healthy civilization. We must do more to build social morality  and professional ethics, stand up bravely for ideals, stress  convictions and ethics, take a clear-cut stand against money  worship, extreme individualism, and a decadent life style, stand  up for what is right, and root out evil influences. Today,  problems with mayhem in the cultural marketplace remain fairly  glaring. Resolute actions must be taken for further  rectification.    In a certain sense, a socialist market economy is a legal  system economy. We must improve legislation, particularly  economic legislation, and judicial and administrative  enforcement work in accordance with "the Decisions" goals for  building a legal system. We must thoroughly educate all the  people in the law, improve the legal awareness and the concept  of the law of the entire society, and bring into play the role  of legal supervision, organizational supervision, mass  supervision, and public opinion supervision. Nowadays, social  order problems are rather glaring in some places. This must be  given serious attention. Leading cadres at all levels are  comrades in charge, first of all, who must further improve the  leadership of social order work. They must truly regard the  maintenance of order in their own locale as a serious political  obligations. They must unflaggingly crack down hard on all  criminal activities, and resolutely force down the trend toward  rise in all kinds of cases, particularly large and important  cases. They must correctly deal with various internal  contradictions among the people, make sure that they do careful  work, understand how matters can develop from small beginnings,  take preventive measure, and strive to nip in the bud the  various factors that damage political stability and public order.    Better building of clean government and opposing decadence  are necessary conditions and important underpinings for the  building of a socialist market economy system. Thanks to the  work done by the Central Committee and the provincial CPC  committee, the struggle against decadence is proceeding smoothly  throughout the province. It is developing healthily.  Nevertheless, work in these regards is spotty, and the task is  still a fairly daunting one when viewed in light of Central  Committee requirements and the desires of the broad masses of  rank and file cadres. Therefore, we must maintain a clear view  and continue to work toward assuring periodic results. Leading  cadres at all levels, particularly cadres at the county level  and above, must both serve as models, taking the lead in honesty  and self-discipline, and dare to take charge, strictly meeting  requirements. They must play an important part in the work of  law and discipline enforcement units in enforcing the law and  enforcing discipline in the improvement of Party style and the  building of clean government, providing vigorous support for  their work.    Economic system reform is a profound revolution having a  bearing on many areas in the economic foundation and  superstructure. We must handle well the correlation among  reform, development, and stability, handle well the interest  relationships of all quarters, improve people's conception of  the overall good, make full use of mass organizations such as  labor unions, the Young Communist League, and the Women's  Association, as well as the enthusiasm of all democratic  factions. We must arouse all positive elements that can be  aroused, and we must convert negative factors into positive  factors. We must improve the ideological education of rank and  file cadres, guide everyone in how to deal correctly with  readjustments of interest relationships that reform occasions,  further shape a strong cooperative force that works heart and  soul on construction, ensure that all our work is done in a  stable and unified environment. and move ahead exuberantly from  the broadest and deepest mass foundation.    3. Study and Mastery of Comrade Xiaoping's Theory for  Further Party Building Requires the Building of Leadership Teams  First. Greater building of leadership teams at all levels  is the key to good performance in party building. Overall, teams  at all levels throughout the province are in good shape. They  have been able to stand the test at some key times, and they  have done real deeds in their work. Nevertheless, they are  unsuited in many ways to the requirements of reform and opening  up to the outside world, and the development of a socialist  market economy. They must be steadily perfected and improved.  The caliber of team members must be further improved to increase  the ability to run the socialist market economy. This is an  important part of the current better building of teams and  raising of the leadership level. Work style must be genuinely  changed, formalism must be overcome, and investigation and study  must be a regular work requirement that is put on the daily  agenda of important things to do. We must enter the front line  of reform and construction to do a solid job of studying some  major problems in reform and development, making no decisions  without investigation, postponing decisions when investigation  is incomplete, and making decisions anew after thorough  investigation. We must select good people in accordance with  cadre's "four transformation" plans and the principle of their  possession of both ability and political integrity. We must  constantly place cadres of good political caliber in leadership  teams at all levels -- cadres who are versed in economic work,  and who dare to blaze trails, particularly middle-age and young  cadres. We must pay special attention to the nurture and  promotion of party and government hands who can act in terms of  the situation as a whole and who can open the way to new  endeavors. Every time leadership teams finish their terms in  office, the problem of insufficient reserve cadres becomes more  glaring. We must take immediate action to improve work in this  regard.    The party's grassroots organization is the party's  stronghold  in the basic level organization of society. It is the foundation  for all party work and all combat strength. CPC committees at  all levels must genuinely give prominent place to the building  of the grassroots organization as part of party building. They  must firmly decide to change the weak and apathetic state of  some grassroots organizations. They must genuinely build  grassroots organizations into strongholds for unifying and  leading the masses to realize the party's combat goals. Better  building of the party in township and town enterprises, in three  kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises, and in  civilian-operated scientific and technical enterprises has  become an important and urgent task in the building of  grassroots organization. Investigation and study must be  diligently conducted, attention given to the summarization of  experiences, and concrete direction given.    This conference has one more topic, namely to consider the  work report of the provincial advisory committee. In the spirit  of the 14th Party Congress and the recommendations of the  provincial advisory committee, following this meeting, the  provincial advisory committee will no longer exist. Since its  founding, the provincial advisory committee has helped the  provincial CPC committee do a large bit of highly effective  work. It has made outstanding accomplishments in advancing the  provinces reform and opening up to the outside world, and its  modernization, as well as in safeguarding and developing a  tranquil and unified political situation. The old comrades on  the provincial advisory committee earnestly practice what they  preach, and they have served as models in bringing about a  changeover from the old to the new in the cadre corps. One might  say that there has not been a single work achievement of any  kind that is not a crystallization of the painstaking labor, the  wisdom, and the sweat of the old comrades. In the past, today,  and in the future, the old comrades have been, are, and will be  valuable wealth. The lofty spirit of the old comrades in  devoting their lives to the revolution, their fine tradition of  honesty in the performance of official duties, their noble  morale character of making contributions without arrogance, and  their rich and beneficial precious experiences forever deserves  our emulation and continuation. CPC committees at all levels  must better look after the political and daily life of old  comrades. They must continue to listen with an open mind to  their valuable views. Although the provincial advisory committee  will no longer exist after this meeting, it is hoped that the  old comrades will continue to care about and support our work,  and constantly make new contributions in advancing our  province's reform and development.</p>

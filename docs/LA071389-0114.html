			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: BEVERLY HILLS;  </P> <P> CITY MANAGER WINS AWARD  </P> <P> City Manager Edward S. Kreins was awarded the Burton E. Green Public Service  Award at a policeman's black tie ball.  </P> <P> Kreins, city manager for 10 years and police chief for four years before that,  was the first recipient of the award, which is named after the oil man who  struck it rich by developing Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> It is designed to honor city executives and managers "whose career best  exemplifies dedication to public service and whose character embodies the  spirit and courage associated with the name of Burton E. Green," a city  statement said.  </P> <P> A separate cash award of $1,000 is to be announced later in the year for a  graduate of Beverly Hills High School who is interested in a career in public  service.  </P> <P> The award is funded by a grant from the Burton E. Green Foundation, which was  set up by Green and his wife in 1960.  </P> <P> Green and two partners formed the Rodeo &amp; Water Co. in 1906 to exploit the  land they originally bought in the hope of striking oil.  </P> <P> They called it Beverly Hills after Green read in a newspaper that  then-president William Howard Taft had vacationed in Beverly Farms, Mass.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> SOS letter -- A Jan. 14 letter to the editor from Sylvia Easton, chairwoman of  the Irvine Task Force for the Homeless, regarding the closing of Share Our  Selves, was incorrectly edited to indicate that about 200,000 needy die in  Orange County each year. The meaning intended was that if the 200,000 who seek  services from SOS each year were turned away, many could die.  </P></p>

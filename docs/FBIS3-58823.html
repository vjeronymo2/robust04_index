Janmaat, sole parliamentary representative of the Centrum  Democrat party, said of Ernst Hisch Ballin: "For Jews to be  nomads, fine, but that they should enjoy public office, no."    He added that it was natural that Ballin's parents should  flee Germany during the Nazi persecutions, "but why did he come  to the Netherlands?"    Judicial officials said that Janmaat would be charged with  racist and discriminatory comments.    A Justice Ministry spokesman said Ballin would make no  comment on Janmaat's remarks.    In the same interview, Janmaat attacked the junior minister  for agriculture, Dzsingisz Gabor, on the grounds that he was  born in Hungary. Political life should only be open to "Dutch  citizens of at least three generations standing," he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Linda Choy and Kenneth Ko] </F>   [Text] The Sino-British Land Commission yesterday approved  the release of 56.81 hectares of land for private and assisted  housing Although the overall amount of land -- 117.27 hectares  -- endorsed in the disposal programme for 1994-95 is eight per  cent down on last year's 127 hectares, the grant for residential  use has been increased by 23 per cent, or 10.8 hectares.  British team leader Tony Eason described the three hour meeting  as a "positive and co- operative" exchange with his Chinese  counterpart, Chen Rongchun.    The extra land supply for residential housing was greeted  enthusiastically by the chairman of the Hong Kong Bank John  Gray, who said that the Government was heading in the right  direction in combatting property speculation. Big developers  also hailed the increase as a significant step towards  moderating housing prices, which have reached unaffordable  levels for most families.    A spokesman for the Real Estate Developers' Association of  Hong Kong, Stewart Leung, called the increase in private  residential land supply "substantial". However, he stressed  that to make domestic apartments available sooner, the  Government should try to streamline the increasingly complicated  and time-consuming procedures for processing developments.    The chairman of the Legislative Council housing panel, Lee  Wing- tat, also welcomed the news as a "good sign".    Yesterday, both the Chinese and British team leaders were  cautious in commenting on the effect on property prices.  However, they said the land grant should be seen as a positive  sign of each government's will to solve the housing shortage.  Of the 56.81 hectares of residential land, 31.43 hectares was  granted for assisted-housing programmes such as the Home  Ownership Scheme, the private sector participation scheme, the  sandwich-class housing scheme, the housing society development  and village housing. This represents a 14 per cent, or  3.8-hectare, increase on last year's grant for  Government-assisted housing. Another 25.38 hectares for private  residential construction was included in the 31 hectares set  aside for commercial, residential and industrial development.    According to Mr Eason, about 20 hectares will be used for  high- density development. But he refused to estimate the  number of flats nor the total floor area of the residential  housing that might be provided. He refused also to specify  where the sites were, apart from saying that most of them were  likely to be in the New Territories.    Asked whether the increase would cool the property prices,  Mr Eason said: "I do expect the market to see this as  a...positive step to inject additional supply into the market.  "[As to] what effect there is on the market sentiment, of  course, this is not the only factor that people in the market  will take into account," he said. "So I think we shall have to  wait and see exactly what its effect is."    Mr Chen said the extra land grant would ease property  prices.  However, he said the property price-rise was a complicated  problem to be solved by the Hong Kong British Government.    The question of the Container Terminal 9, which requires  about 60 hectares of land, remained unresolved. Both Mr Chen  and Mr Eason said it would be discussed at another forum.    Mr Chen said: "China and Britain are discussing the issue  through other channels. Before there is a result, the Land  Commission will not consider that." Mr Eason said he was not  disappointed by the lack of agreement on a land grant for the  container terminal. Until discussions elsewhere had been  concluded, the Land Commission had postponed its consideration,  he said.    Other categories of land grant included 17.67 hectares for  public utilities including educational, welfare, religious,  recreational and other uses. Another 37.16 hectares of land is  allocated for special requirements. This more than doubled last  year's grant of 16.51 hectares.</p>

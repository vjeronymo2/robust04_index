			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Japan shuns the western image A few years ago a flick through Japanese television channels would have revealed countless advertisements featuring smiling, blonde models. Foreigners were even used to selling such typically Japanese products as instant noodles. Today, however, you are more likely to find a home-grown celebrity gently enjoying one of life's little pleasures. Mykel Robey, an American who has been modelling in Japan for 13 years, says he has recently noticed a sharp downturn in the demand for western models. 'The Japanese got smart and started looking at their own race and realised that there were a lot of good-looking Japanese they could use for half the price,' he says. This growing sense of confidence in the Japanese identity is not based only on physical changes. The phenomenon of the disappearing 'gaijin tarento' (foreign entertainer or personality) in advertising is also attributed to the collapse of the economic bubble of the late 1980s. Akio Fukuoka, a creative director at Dentsu, the largest Japanese agency, who in the past was responsible for ads using such well-known gaijin as Arnold Schwarzenegger, says consumers now respond better to images they can identify with, rather than fantasy figures. 'It seems that it is not authentic to use a foreigner to convey a message of what is good for them,' he says. A Dentsu report on consumer trends for the 1990s is subtitled 'Seikatsu nakushite, shohi nashi' (without life, there can be no consumption). Quality of life is seen as the paramount consideration after the consumption drive of the post-war decades. Over the past year, television advertisements have typically become softer and less strident. Colours are muted, music is gentler and products are shown in the context of helping people to enjoy life, rather than working till they drop. One of Dentsu's most successful recent series of television ads has been a long, low-key campaign for Kirin's Ichiban-shibori beer, using a well-known actor in a variety of domestic situations and a quirky, catchy signature tune. Each advert ends with the actor drinking some beer and saying 'Ureshii' ('I'm happy'). Some adverts have an aura of nostalgia for the old days, when life was less complicated. In Japanese history, periods of sustained emulation of foreign culture have often been followed by a period of cultural consolidation and mild reaction against foreign influences. On a small scale, something of the kind may be happening now. Dentsu's list of hit products of 1992 includes old-fashioned fans and yukatas, the traditional cotton robes worn to summer festivals or around the house. The popularity of Sumo wrestling has boomed and a record number of people visited shrines and temples to welcome in the New Year. Kimono makers are hoping the popularity of traditional clothing will be given a further boost by the wedding later this year of Crown Prince Naruhito. In difficult economic times, Japanese consumers are finding comfort in rediscovering their roots, according to Fukuoka. But he adds: 'If you ate Japanese-style for 365 days, sometimes you would want to eat western food.' Exotic locations and blue-eyed models are unlikely to have made a permanent exit from Japanese TV screens, but their days of supremacy may be over.</p>

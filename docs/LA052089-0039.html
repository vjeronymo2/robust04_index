			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. ATTEMPTS TO OUST GEN. NORIEGA  </P> <P> In all of my 25 years of religiously reading your magnificent paper, never has  my stomach turned as much as when I saw the photo on the front page on May 11  showing the Panamanian opposition vice presidential candidate Guillermo Ford  being beaten with a steel pipe by someone who clearly could be seen by his  facial expression to be enjoying hurting Ford.  </P> <P> Never has a photo so reviled and saddened me, showing a soldier passively  standing by, allowing this violence to occur. I was and remain stunned by your  photo, so stunned and shocked that I do not know how to respond to this sight.  </P> <P> DAN ROBBINS  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

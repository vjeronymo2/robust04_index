			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> STATE PANEL CLEARS P.V. SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER  </P> <P> Palos Verdes school board member Marlys Kinnel did not violate state  conflict-of-interest laws when she voted in 1988 to ratify a policy giving an  exemption from building fees to a number of developers, including the  part-owner of the mall where she did promotion work, state officials have  ruled.  </P> <P> The ruling by the state Fair Political Practices Commission comes in response  to a complaint filed last October by Rolling Hills Estates resident Joanne  Petow. Petow's complaint alleged Kinnel should have disqualified herself from  voting on the policy because her employer's interests were at stake.  </P> <P> "I knew I had done nothing wrong," Kinnel said in an interview Wednesday,  adding that the complaint was a "very vicious tactic used to affect (last  fall's) election."  </P> <P> The complaint was filed while Kinnel was running for reelection to the school  board, seeking one of three open seats. Petow opposed her election, supporting  three candidates who ran unsuccessfully as a slate. Kinnel handily won  reelection.  </P> <P> Petow's complaint stemmed from a $1.50-square-foot fee imposed on developers by  the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District. The fee went into effect in  June, 1987, but district officials, without school board approval, granted  exemptions to developers who contended their projects had been delayed beyond  the deadline because of events out of their control.  </P> <P> Then, in June, 1988, Kinnel and other school board members unanimously approved  a retroactive measure that officially instituted the district's policy of  granting the exemptions. The action allowed developer Ron Florance to retain a  $274,500 fee exemption that he had previously been given for an 80-home  development.  </P> <P> Pettow alleged in her complaint that Kinnel should not have voted on the policy  because she worked at the Shops of Palos Verdes, a mall owned by by H &amp; F  Associates, a partnership in which Florance is a general partner. As such,  Florance should be considered a source of income for Kinnel, the complaint  alleged.  </P> <P> However, the commission disagreed. "The mere fact that Mr. Florance is a  general partner in H &amp; F Associates and has a 50% interest therein, does  not support the conclusion that he should be considered a 'source' of income to  Ms. Kinnel," a commission attorney wrote in an April 24 letter to Petow.  </P> <P> "Rather, the partnership, H &amp; F Associates, would be considered the  'source' of income to Ms. Kinnel. Based upon our investigation . . . there was  no evidence that H &amp; F Associates would have been materially affected by  Ms. Kinnel's participation in the governmental decision at issue."  </P> <P> At the time the complaint was filed, Kinnel, who resigned from the mall job in  December to devote more time to family matters, contended she did not work for  Florance, but for a management company hired by H &amp; F to run the mall.  Florance said he never spoke to Kinnel about the exemption for his housing  project and had nothing to do with hiring her to work for the management  company.  </P> <P> Petow said she did not agree with the commission's decision. "I am  disappointed, naturally," she said.  </P> <P> However, she said that, because Kinnel has stepped down from her job, "the  conflict . . . has been removed." Moreover, she said she is glad that the  developer fee exemption granted to Florance has subsequently been rescinded.  </P> <P> David Capelouto, the district's assistant superintendent for business, said the  exemption on the property was removed late last year after Florance sold the  development to another company. The action was taken after the district's  lawyers indicated that the exemption was not transferable to another party, he  said.  </P> <P> The new owner is paying the fee under protest, Capelouto said.  </P></p>

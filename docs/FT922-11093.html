			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / International Company News: GAN profits decline Groupe des Assurances Nationales (GAN), one of France's three big state-controlled insurance companies, sustained a slight decline in net profits of 1.7 per cent to FFr2.32bn (Dollars 421m) in 1991, from FFr2.36bn in 1990, writes Alice Rawsthorn. GAN, which is preparing for a share sale probably later this year as part of the French government's partial privatisation programme, is raising its dividend by 9.3 per cent to FFr50.3, despite a drop in earnings per share to FFr209.6, from FFr230.9 The company, chaired by Mr Francois Heilbronner and involved with banking through its controlling investment in the CIC group, saw its overall sales rise by 21 per cent to FFr116bn. The level of capital also rose 25 per cent to FFr22bn. Its net banking revenue rose by 10.6 per cent to FFr16.9bn. Last autumn GAN announced its was increasing its majority stake in CIC from 56 to 80 per cent. Insurance, which is still the largest part of the group, mustered an increase in turnover of 18.5 per cent to FFr39.7bn despite the competitive state of the French insurance industry. However, GAN is believed to have had difficulty in its UK and Italian insurance interests last year because of the unstable state of the markets in those countries.</p>

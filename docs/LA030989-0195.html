J. Brian  Clarke, president and chief executive of the Avon, Conn.-based company that has  $540.3 million in debts, said the board took the action two weeks ago. The  committee representing Coleco's creditors in its bankruptcy case has also  approved exploring a sale, Clarke said. Morton E. Handel, Coleco's chairman,  said no purchase offers have been received. He wouldn't say whether any talks  with interested bidders have been held.  </P></p>

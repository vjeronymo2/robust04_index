			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Beckett praises ideal leader Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, yesterday paid tribute to John Smith in the Commons. The following is an edited extract of her speech: 'On these benches we . . . mourn for our country's loss, but we grieve for our own. There are few, the announcement of whose death would bring tears to the eyes of everyone who knew them. John Smith was such a man. He was . . . a man of formidable intellect, of the highest ethics and of staunch integrity. Part of the conventional wisdom of British politics was that he looked like a bank manager - something that caused him amusement and some bank managers some resentment. Perhaps in consequence he was often labelled as unduly sober or excessively cautious, especially by those who judge readily and judged on the facade. But though he certainly had a safe pair of hands, appearances were deceptive. John was no sobersides. He had a wicked sense of humour, often displayed . . . in this House. He loved a good gossip and he liked nothing better than a convivial drink with friends. And one of his favourite sayings was that 'to succeed in politics, you have to be prepared to take a risk'. In fact, I used to joke with him that he was an ideal combination in a political leader - someone who looked the acme of sober judgment, but was perfectly prepared to take a flyer when he thought the occasion called for it. Some months ago I saw a political profile of John that had a photograph of him as a young boy. He had a wicked grin from ear to ear, his tie was up round his ear, and in the text it mentioned that his shirt-tails were always hanging out - it was a kind of a 'Just William' picture. Those who saw John Smith every day had no difficulty in detecting that boy in the statesman and the leader. Not long ago, I observed to a colleague that I had never known a man like John. He had such calm certainty, such natural strength and self-confidence  -but while he had supreme confidence, he lacked any trace of cockiness or of conceit . . . I have never known a man so at ease with him-self. He adored his family, and our hearts go out to Elizabeth and to the girls. He was at his most lovable when he was talking about his daughters. But the love and support that John offered to and received from his family was not only the core of his personal life - it was central to his political life and beliefs. He wanted for others the richness he enjoyed . . . That feeling for others, along with his hatred of injustice, were the forces that drove him, the service to which he gave his life. Last night he spoke at a gala dinner in London. He was in high fettle and in high spirits. He spoke not from a text, but from notes. And when he sat down I congratulated him, especially on his final sentence. Spoken as it was, off the cuff and from the heart, they were almost the last words I heard him say. He looked at the assembled gathering and he said: 'The opportunity to serve our country - that is all we ask.' Let it stand as his epitaph.'</p>

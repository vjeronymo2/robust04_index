			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL HEADQUARTERS FOR WELLS FARGO;  </P> <P> TOWER IN KOLL CENTER PLANNED  </P> <P> Wells Fargo Bank gave the Koll Co. a boost when it said it would move into a  planned 16-story building just north of the San Diego Freeway in Koll Center  Irvine.  </P> <P> The bank signed a 15-year lease for nearly $30 million, and the building will  now be called Wells Fargo Tower.  </P> <P> That will make Koll's lenders happy, since they can be assured of one large  tenant even before the $85-million building has been built. Construction starts  this month.  </P> <P> The bank took 71,000 square feet of space on floors 7 through 9.  </P> <P> The bank will consolidate its regional offices -- now in the Irvine Co.'s  Newport  </P> <P> Center -- and other operations near John Wayne Airport. Altogether, nearly 300  employees will move.  </P> <P> The building -- designed by local architects Langdon Wilson Mumper -- will be  the fourth tower Koll has constructed in the business center, which extends on  both sides of the freeway. The giant Newport Beach-based developer plans to  build three more office towers, one more low-rise office building and a third  hotel.  </P> <P> Koll's partners on the new tower -- scheduled for completion in April, 1990 --  are Hart Advisors Inc. of Hartford, Conn., and Columbia Savings &amp; Loan  Assn. in Beverly Hills.

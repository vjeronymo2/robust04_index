			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> LEBANON HOSTAGE SURFACES  </P> <P> A West German relief worker surfaced in Lebanon after his abduction 10 days  earlier. Markus Quint offered few clues about his disappearance when he spoke  with reporters in the southern city of Zahrani, headquarters of the  ASME-Humanitas relief group for which he works. He appeared with Nabih Berri,  head of the Shiite Muslim militia Amal, who said his organization obtained  Quint's release without paying a ransom. He did not name the kidnapers but said  "we exerted a lot of pressure and carried out raids." Meanwhile, Syrian forces  joined the search for an elderly Briton, Jack Mann, who disappeared last week.  A group calling itself the Cells of Armed Struggle claimed Friday that it had  taken a hostage, but it did not provide an identification.  </P></p>

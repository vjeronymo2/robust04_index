			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MALIBU;  </P> <P> MAN CRITICALLY HURT IN TRAFFIC DISPUTE  </P> <P> An off-duty county security officer shot and critically wounded a man in an  early-morning traffic dispute Monday on Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu,  sheriff's deputies said. The Los Angeles County safety officer was questioned  but not arrested following the incident, which occurred about 12:45 a.m in the  19500 block, Deputy Hal Grant said.  </P> <P> The officer's name was not released. Wounded was Fred Inouye, 25, of  Chatsworth, who was hit once in the chest by one of four shots fired by the  officer. He was in critical condition at UCLA Medical Center. Grant said the  officer had suddenly swerved while driving, causing Inouye to take evasive  action. The two vehicles stopped, and Inouye got out of his car and walked up  to the officer's truck. As the men began arguing, the officer allegedly fired a  gun and hit Inouye in the chest. When Inouye retreated to the back of the  truck, the officer fired three more shots but missed.  </P></p>

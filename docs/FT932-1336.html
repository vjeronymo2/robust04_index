			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour offers to identify big donors LABOUR IS prepared to take the lead in identifying individuals who provide it with donations above Pounds 5,000, Mr Larry Whitty, the party's general secretary, said yesterday, Ivor Owen writes. Mr Whitty said he looked to the Commons' home affairs committee - made up of Labour and Conservative members - which is examining the funding of political parties, to recommend a change in the law requiring the disclosure of all substantial political donations made by individuals. He undertook to recommend that the party's national executive should take unilateral action in the event of the committee failing to make such a recommendation, or the government failing to introduce the necessary legislation. He said that in the period up to last year's general election about 15 people had made individual donations of Pounds 10,000 or more to the Labour party. A proposal to increase the number of women for whom Labour MPs must vote for in shadow cabinet elections fell at the last hurdle yesterday when the party rejected a package of reforms to modernise its Westminster operations. The move came less than a week after the PLP had backed a proposal to raise the minimum number of votes that must be cast for women from three to four.</p>

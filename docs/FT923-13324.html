			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Golf driver sells for Pounds 92,400: Saleroom A PRIMITIVE golf club fashioned from a lump of iron by a Scottish blacksmith around 1700 sold for Pounds 92,400 at Sotheby's sale of golfing memorabilia yesterday. The club was discovered in a garden shed in Edinburgh and the long ash shaft has a grip which is still in good condition. The 42 1/2 inch long club weighs 24 ounces - more than twice the weight of a contemporary driver. The price paid was way above the Pounds 40,000 estimate and set an auction record for a golf club. The previous best was the Pounds 55,000 paid at Christie's in 1990 for a rake iron club of similar antiquity. The buyer at Loretto School in Musselburgh, Scotland, was the London dealer Mr Titus Kendall who was bidding on behalf of the Valderamma Golf Club in Sotte Grande, southern Spain. The club is setting up a golfing museum as part of its strategy to attract the Ryder Cup tournament. It acquired 13 lots at the morning session of an auction which Sotheby's holds annually to coincide with the British Open championship, which starts this week at nearby Muirfield. Also going to Spain is a jeu de mail hardwood iron-bound club, made in France in the mid 18th century, which sold for Pounds 10,450. Jeu de mail is a game with close similarities to golf. It is believed to have been introduced to Scotland by Mary Queen of Scots in the 16th century, leading to the development of golf. The club also paid Pounds 8,800 for a feather golf ball of around 1830, inscribed with the name of the maker AT Alexander. The record for the golf club is some consolation to Sotheby's for its failure on Friday to sell one of the finest pieces of English furniture to be offered at auction in recent years - a library table made by Gillows of Lancaster in 1778 to a design by Chippendale. It was bought in at Pounds 240,000, less than half the sum anticipated. The library table was expected to do well because of its excellent provenance. It was sold by a descendant of Sir James Ibbetson of Otley, Yorkshire, who had paid Chippendale Pounds 551 for his contribution. It was the only commission that Chippendale, a native of Otley, undertook in the parish of his birth. In general the furniture sale did quite well, totalling more than Pounds 1.4m. A pair of Gothic revival rosewood chairs, commissioned by King George IV in 1828 for Windsor Castle, was bought by the London dealer Blairman for Pounds 74,800, comfortably above forecast.</p>

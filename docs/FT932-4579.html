			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Macedonia wool suits fuel US ire US TEXTILE and apparel importers have attacked as 'insanity' a new US quota to limit the importing of wool suits from Macedonia to 80,000 a year, cutting the present level by about one fifth, Nancy Dunne writes from Washington. The decision, by the government's Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements, was 'another example of the business-as-usual attitude pervading the US textile programme,' said Ms Laura Jones, executive director of the US Association of Importers of Textiles and Apparel. 'Is this Macedonia's reward for enforcing the UN's trade sanctions against Serbia, its largest trading partner?' she asked. The US has been gradually imposing textile and clothing quotas on most eastern European economies, despite a stated US policy of helping their development by increasing trade.</p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / International Company News: Del Monte Royal Foods confident of hitting target DEL MONTE Royal Foods (Delfood), which acquired the European food group Del Monte Foods International (DMFI) for R2.3bn in December 1992, reports attributable earnings of R82.2m (Dollars 24.7m) for the six months to May 28. Comparable figures have not been provided owing to the re-organisation of Delfood's operations following the DMFI deal, but management is confident Delfood will achieve its forecast earnings of 60.1 cents a share for this financial year. Turnover at R651.3m was behind budget, but the maintenance of margins, lower finance charges and tight control of working capital and expenses allowed budgeted earnings to be achieved. The company is paying a dividend of 8 cents per share. DMFI is the principal operating subsidiary of Delfood, which also has food investments in South Africa. Markets for the group's products generally softened in both areas during the reporting period. DMFI managed to maintain market share, while in South Africa a difficult operating environment was partially countered by the strong performance of traditional brands and the successful launch of Mars products. The share placing necessary to finance the DMFI transaction has significantly changed the group's balance sheet. Ordinary shareholders' funds have increased to R2.36bn from R204m, while the debt equity ratio of 17.8 per cent compares with 46.9 per cent before the takeover. Management expects that trading conditions in its main European markets will remain difficult for the rest of the year, while South African prospects depend on 'political progress, improving business confidence and consumer demand'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Olga Kuchkina report: "Will There Be a Third Coming of </F> Gaydar?"]    [Text] Sunday. The "White House" is deserted. There is a  small number of people in the Blue Room, where Gaydar's letter  has been disseminated and where he is giving a short news  conference.    "When I accepted the offer of the president and the premier  to resume my work in the government in September 1993, it was  clear to me that, while being responsible, of course, for  everything happening in the economy and with the economic  reform, I would have only a limited range of tools for  influencing the shaping of current policy. Nevertheless,  mindful of the tense situation, I remained convinced that the  government would be able to rally around the president and  nonetheless pursue a sufficiently responsible policy of  stabilizing the situation in the economy...."    In his opinion, some things have been done: The rate of  inflation fell sharply from 26 percent in August to 13 percent  in December; the economy has been opened up; a whole package of  documents has been adopted to ensure the start of reforms in the  housing sphere; on the whole, a certain movement toward general  economic stabilization has been begun. At the same time, with  increasing frequency decisions have been made in the government  with which either the first vice premier was not familiar or  objected to them categorically. Deeming it not possible under  these conditions to be responsible for other people's decisions,  Yegor Gaydar is leaving the government. Ella Pamfilova is  leaving too.    I put several questions to Gaydar:    "Have you weighed the consequences of your step insofar as  your places and positions may be taken by directly opposite  figures and directly opposite positions?"    "Yes, of course. Naturally, we hope that the government's  course will still not be radically changed. But there is a  rigid logic of life here. It makes sense to hold some position  for as long as you can operate from this position. Or at least  block actions with which you disagree. Otherwise you simply  make common cause with decisions you consider harmful and  irresponsible."    Earlier Gaydar had cited two examples. The decision on a  joint monetary system with Belarus, which is possible in  principle if it is clearly formulated and if control systems are  defined. In fact the ill-conceived version of the signed bank  agreement will reproduce chaos in the monetary sphere and  unlimited subsidizing of Belarus at the expense of Russian  citizens -- something that we were getting away from with  tremendous difficulty during 1992. The second was the decision  to construct the Parliamentary Center at a cost of $500 million,  which Gaydar calls immoral.    The former vice premier was slow to answer my question as to  whether Gaydar had already met with the president and what  Yeltsin's emotional reaction was, but the expression on his face  caused the assembled people to laugh in concert. Gaydar  hastened to remark that the president understands the situation  perfectly and that they had spoken calmly.    "Are you shifting the center of your work to the  parliament?"  I asked.    Gaydar replied in the affirmative. In all cases, he  remarked, we will struggle to ensure that the key committees --  defense, security, and international policy -- do not pass into  the hands of our opponents; here we adhere to firm  ultimatum-like positions, and our civilized, considered policy  will be aimed at keeping out of power adventurists capable of  drawing the country into war.    "Are you thinking of working with society and winning it  over  more intelligently than you have done before?"    "Yes, we will endeavor to work by rectifying all our serious  mistakes which were undoubtedly made."    Asked when he felt himself to be the leader of the  democratic  movement, Gaydar replied that he still does not feel himself to  be this, although maybe this happened on the night of 3-4  October, unexpectedly, which was a rather unpleasant surprise.    In the end I asked:    "What mood are you in? Do you regard what has happened in  terms of a 'defeat' or in some other terms?"    "I would say this: We have lost a battle, but I certainly do  not believe that we have lost the war. Moreover, we are simply  obliged to win it. Our departure marks not the end but the  continuation of the struggle. The logic of 'the worse, the  better' is categorically unaccaptable to us."    One way or another, we have gotten a new political quality,  whose further development is hard to predict today.</p>

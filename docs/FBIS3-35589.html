The accords aim at scrapping the nuclear weapons  deployed in Ukraine.    A Russian military spokesman has told Interfax that  Ukraine's  Defence Ministry has warned the strategic missile forces  personnel that the officers refusing to swear allegiance to  Ukraine will be dismissed.    The spokesman described these Ukrainian actions as the start  of a seizure of strategic nuclear weapons. He stressed that in  these conditions the Russian military could not bear  responsibility for the nuclear ammunition's control and service.  He did not rule out that pressed by Kiev, quite a few missile  forces officers would have to leave Ukraine with "unpredictable  consequences."    He is convinced that the fate of the nuclear weapons in  Ukraine must concern primarily Kiev and western countries. "The  loss of proper control over nuclear weapons may be disastrous",  he stressed.</p>

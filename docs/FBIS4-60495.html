			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi by </F> unidentified correspondent in Tripoli; date not given]    [Text] [AL-HAYAH] Your Excellency, Colonel, Mu'ammar  al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the revolution, 25 years on from the  revolution, do you believe you have succeeded, and in what area?    [Al-Qadhdhafi] That is a traditional question which is put  to me every year.    [AL-HAYAH] No, the 25th anniversary of the revolution is  different...    [Al-Qadhdhafi] No. The question was put to me on the 24th,  20th, and 10th anniversaries. Of course, the event that  occurred 25 years ago in Libya had been shaped and decided by us  since 1959 on the basis of the philosophy for which the  revolution was launched. The aim was to bring about a turning  point in the history of mankind. And we are determined to bring  about a new era like that of the French revolution, which  initiated the era bourgeois republics. We decided that the  al-Fatih [1 September] revolution would end the era of republics  and launch the people's jamahiriyat [of masses]. From our  serious analysis of history, we can expect results, proceeding  from the available factors. This is why we announced that the  era of the masses would begin, and nationalities would triumph,  and that there would be a conflict among nationalities. And  that the states comprised of several nationalities would break  up. We expected that before the separation in Yugoslavia and  the Soviet Union. And we still expect the collapse of the  United States. The United States consists of a mosaic of  conflicting pieces. It will not hold together in the era of the  masses. The blacks will become independent, the Red Indians  will become independent, the whites will become independent, and  so will the other minorities. And a civil war could begin in  the United States one day like in Lebanon if no American takes  the initiative like Gorbachev to grant the peoples of the United  States their independence, hence conducting the separation  peacefully, as happened in the Soviet Union.    But to cling to the domination of Washington, the White  House, the CIA, the National Security Council, and the major  companies... all these are nightmares which will lead to a  rebellion, and hence to bloody separation. That is, unless  someone forestalls events, allowing these peoples to become  independent, as happened in the Soviet Union. It is another  prophecy which will come about in the future. We had said that  the Soviet Union, which consisted of several nationalities,  would collapse. There is now one state about which no one is  talking, that is the United States. We say that the United  States will break up peacefully or through war. I mean that the  Libyan revolution is a revolution of a new prophecy and new  vision for mankind which we cannot judge on the basis of what  has happened in Libya. Its results will emerge in decades and  centuries, and after generations. It will then be said that the  al-Fatih revolution was the historic turning point. The early  sign was the emergence of the revolution of originality, that is  fundamentalism, which spread and was exploited and distorted,  turning it into bullets and oppression... But at the beginning  we launched this cry, namely that the south must advance toward  the north, and that the fringes must advance toward the center,  which should be destroyed. And that the oppressed should climb  onto the stage. And that purity should begin from the desert.  And that originality should be revived and whatever is alien  abandoned. We announced the revolution of originality and  fundamentalism. Analysts believe it was us who sparked off this  revolution. The important factor for the Libyan revolution is  laying the foundation for the era of the masses, that is, the  establishment of people's power. There is now for the first  time a state run without a government, without a president,  without a king, and without a regular army. It is run through  the people's committees and congresses. Whatever arrogant,  ignorant, absurd, and spiteful people say to undermine that, it  is an irrefutable fact, namely that Libya is the cornerstone of  a new era called the era of the masses and the jamahiri system,  represented in the people's congresses and the people's  self-government. This is what Bakunin and Proudhon tried to  achieve. Even before Marx there were philosophers like al-Razi  and al-Mu'tazilah [group of Muslims applying logic] who dreamt  of achieving what has just now been achieved.    [AL-HAYAH] What is preoccupying you most these days?    [Al-Qadhdhafi] At the national level, we are preoccupied  with the current confrontation between a small country and a  small people, that is, the Libyan people, and three major  states, all of which are nuclear and Christian states. Libya is  a Muslim state and they are imperialist states which have the  right of veto (in the Security Council). And they have atomic  bombs. Of course, we cannot ignore the fact that we are very  busy with the confrontation with three oppressive, arrogant,  insolent, and tyrannical states.    At the pan-Arab level, we are preoccupied with the fact that  no one has torn down the raised slogan, that is, the Arabs'  unconditional surrender. All that is happening, beginning with  Madrid through Oslo, falls under this slogan, that is, the  Arabs' unconditional surrender. Because in view of the Arab  defeat, the Arab collapse, the tyranny of the Western states  protecting the Israelis, and the nonexistence of the Soviet  Union and the socialist camp, no negotiations will be in the  Arabs' interests. In fact they will mean capitulation. It is  their opportunity to impose capitulation on the Arabs. All that  is being talked about -- like Gaza and Jericho, land for peace,  and the Golan... all this falls under the slogan that the Arabs  must surrender unconditionally and immediately so that the  existing balances will not be upset thereby allowing the Arabs  to raise their heads.    At the international level, we are preoccupied with that  international arrogance and that insolence. Because the world  has turned into a jungle. But we are certain that the small  animals in the jungle will fight with their claws and teeth --  which means that the jungle will drown in blood because of what  imperialism is doing.    [AL-HAYAH] So you are totally opposed to what the  Palestinians have done so far?    [Al-Qadhdhafi] It is not like that. We are looking for a  radical solution to the Palestinian issue. The only peaceful  radical solution is the South African model. If they want to  solve the Palestinian issue, let them follow the South African  model -- which means the Palestinian people's return and free  elections under UN supervision for both the Palestinians and the  Jews, then a democratic Palestinian state would be established.  Without that there is no solution. Proof of this is that the  fighting is still continuing, because Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat]  does not represent all the Palestinians. What we hear on the  news, namely that the PLO has signed an agreement with Israel is  untrue. It is not the PLO; it is Fatah. Even in Fatah there is  a big split. The agreement took place with the Fatah chairman  and his group. They give him Gaza and Jericho, because they fit  their measure. The agreement with the PLO will be on the scale  of Palestine [as a whole].    [AL-HAYAH] Did Abu-'Ammar not contact you? Did you not tell  him your opinion openly?    [Al-Qadhdhafi] It is an ordinary relationship. He contacts  us and sends messages to put us in the picture. But our  position is clear. We support the Palestinian people's return  and the recovery of their rights. We do not support the Gaza  and Jericho accord.    [AL-HAYAH] What about Algeria? Is it not preoccupying you?    [Al-Qadhdhafi] Of course, regrettably, France is currently  taking revenge against Algeria. France and the United States  are behind all that is happening in Algeria. France is backed  primarily by the United States and the Israelis. The Mosad,  French intelligence, and the CIA are involved in the murder,  financing, training, and armament operations, so that Algeria  would pay the price for its independence and rebellion against  France. That is what is happening in Algeria.    [AL-HAYAH] How can you help Algeria?    [Al-Qadhdhafi] By God, that is a worry.... If the aggression  was foreign, the matter would have been clear. But as long as  the Algerians are fighting one another inside the country, no  one can do anything except offering advice and kind words. They  [not further identified] are also trying to get Egypt to pay the  price for its war against the Israelis, the 'Abd-al-Nasir era,  the nationalization of the Suez Canal, and its leadership of the  Arab nation. Egypt is paying the price for that, because the  Americans, the West, and the Israelis consider Egypt the  archenemy. The Israelis want to destroy Egypt. There is a  truce between Egypt and Israel, not peace. They want to exploit  this truce to destroy Egypt so that it will be under Israel's  heel.    [AL-HAYAH] With regard to the Libyan issue and the  blockade imposed on it, how do you view the possibility of  finding a solution or a way out, and do you believe that is  possible?    [Al-Qadhdhafi] If the issue is to do with Lockerbie, there  are solutions proposed which are very feasible and which will  save face for all the parties. But if the Western states have  another objective, then the attempts are improper and we would  be facing a state of colonialism and insolence. And thus we  should prepare ourselves for a confrontation and a war which the  enemy should lose or not win. If the issue is to do with  Lockerbie, it can be resolved easily in accordance with the  formulas being proposed. All international organizations and the  world as a whole support Libya. The three states are isolated,  exposed, and lack even a fig leaf to cover their nakedness  before the world with regard to the Lockerbie issue and the  Libyan position. If their objective is colonialist, then in  this case we are facing a new colonialist attempt and we will  fight.    [AL-HAYAH] With regard to the proposed solutions, is there  anything new and practical?    [Al-Qadhdhafi] Of course, there is a proposal from the Arab  League and from international jurists, namely that a Scottish  court be sent to another country -- The Hague, for example. And  that the two suspects be handed over to the Arab League and then  to this court under agreed UN guarantees. This is the latest  solution we have heard. It is not a Libyan solution or a Libyan  proposal. It is a proposal made by international jurists,  espoused by the Arab League, and supported by the world as a  whole.    [AL-HAYAH] What is the fate of all the weapons in your  possession? Can you look after and service them? You purchased  large quantities of weapons....    [Al-Qadhdhafi] It has become clear that we were not wrong  when we purchased and stockpiled the weapons. Time has shown  that Libya is a target for aggression. One day al-Sadat was  against us, Bourguiba was against us, al-Numayri was against us,  and Hissein Habre was against us. France and the United States  fought alongside them in Chad and Egypt. And Niger's Kountche  was against us, and U.S. fleets threatened us from the sea. And  we were attacked in 1986 by the two biggest states in the world,  that is the United States and Britain. Our children were killed  while asleep in their homes. It has become clear that we were  right when we purchased the weapons and that we were targeted by  an oppressive and direct aggression, and that we were entitled  to have weapons to defend ourselves. The biggest danger  threatening us now is the Israelis' possession of atomic bombs  and nuclear missiles with a 4,000-mile range aimed against  Libya, North Africa, Sudan, and the other Arab states. It is a  very serious matter. Israel has atomic weapons, and the United  States and the West are refusing to talk to the Israelis about  them or to deprive them of this weapon. While the United States  continues to pursue Libya, Korea, Iran, and Pakistan. As for  the Israelis, they are exempt from the pursuit, punishment, and  questioning. They are above international law. They are above  Chapter VII of the UN Charter. If the Security Council decides  a punishment for Israel, the United States uses its right of  veto. Actually we are faced with a very serious situation: An  adversary state is exempt from punishment and from Chapter VII  of the UN Charter, is above international law, and is entitled  to own any weapon of mass destruction, and no one questions it  about anything. They pursued us because of a pharmaceutical  plant until they ascertained it was a pharmaceutical plant. Why  do they not pursue the Israelis, who admit their possession of  atomic bombs and who have not signed the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty?    [AL-HAYAH] You have helped numerous allies since the  revolution erupted. Who is now with you, who has turned against  you, and who has been able to help you during the blockade  period?    [Al-Qadhdhafi] By God, all those we helped support us, each  according to his ability. We helped numerous forces in the  world. We helped people who are now presidents of republics and  heads of state. The West used to say that these are terrorist  camps. These terrorist camps have turned into heads of state  and regular armies, like Museveni and Sam Nujoma in Namibia, or  the presidents of Congo, Angola, and Mozambique... all of them  had their camps in Libya. They [the West] used to call them  terrorists.    [AL-HAYAH] Who has actually offered help since the blockade  began?    [Al-Qadhdhafi] All peoples are sympathizing with us. But  the international arrogance represented in the United States and  the Western states is terrifying the world and the peoples.  Nevertheless, the world as a whole is sympathizing with the  Libyan people.    [AL-HAYAH] In Col. Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi's view, what is  left of the Arab unity idea, especially in view of what is  happening in Yemen?    [Al-Qadhdhafi] Indeed what is happening in Yemen is a  sinister event and gives a bad impression. Regionalism has been  consolidated until regional states have replaced nations. We  now hear about the Kuwaiti nation, the Tunisian nation, and the  Mauritanian nation.... It is amazing for regionalism to be  perpetuated among Arabs to such an extent. What we aspire to  now is an Arab unity that achieves an economic unity and defense  unity, and let the petty states enjoy their regimes and systems:  The kingdom as a kingdom, the sultanate as a sultanate, the  emirate as an emirate, and the republic as a republic. But in  the end there has to be a union for the Arab nation -- a union  that achieves economic unity and defense unity. Even the nature  of the age now does not prompt a move toward centralism, but,  rather, toward localism and the grassroots.    [AL-HAYAH] So you still believe in unity?    [Al-Qadhdhafi] It is a necessity, not a triviality. Without  it, there is no future for any Arab state.    [AL-HAYAH] What would you say to the Yemeni brothers?    [Al-Qadhdhafi] Frankly, as a revolutionary, I am against  sick stability in the Arab homeland. To me, explosions are  better in order to change the stagnant situation. The Arab land  is plundered and should become hot so that it will not be  plundered again. As a revolutionary, I am against sick  stability, futile stability. Instability is better than having  an Arab state that is subservient to the West and Israel.  However, as a revolutionary, I am not concerned over what is  happening in Yemen.... This is from a revolutionary angle. But  politically, the battle must be settled quickly in favor of  Yemen's unity and without further bloodshed.    [AL-HAYAH] Are you in touch with officials there?    [Al-Qadhdhafi] We are in constant contact with them. With  regard to 'Ali Salim al-Bid, he always contacts me, appealing  that it is better that Yemen should not drown in war and blood.  As for the brothers in the north, they say that the only  solution is Aden's surrender in the name of Yemen's unity. They  proceed from the premise that there is one state which has a  president and a capital. I believe that what is happening in  Yemen now is an internal affair, as there is no longer two  states. It is an internal issue.    [AL-HAYAH] Which view do you support more?    [Al-Qadhdhafi] Unity and the revolution, of course.    [AL-HAYAH] A final question regarding those describing  themselves as oppositionists abroad: What would you say to them?    [Al-Qadhdhafi] I say that with the establishment of  people's power, there is no room for opposition. Oppose whom?  The Libyan people? So you are opposing your people and  homeland. In that case, the person becomes a stray dog. That  person is a stray dog when he opposes his people and his  homeland. If there is a rational person who really has a  political opinion, and his opinion is successful, he has the  opportunity to join the people's congresses and to include his  opinion on the people's congresses' agenda. If the congresses  are convinced of this opinion, they will implement it. If they  do not, they will discard it. If there is really a person who  is useful for the homeland, the people's congresses are his  opportunity. If there is a ruling party, he could say that he  has no opportunity because the party is not giving the  opportunity to apply his ideas. The same applies if there was a  ruler ruling the country. But since the people are ruling  through the people's congresses and the people's committees, it  is his opportunity to join the people's congresses. I believe  that it is not possible for anyone of them to oppose, because  the people are the ruler. There is no possibility of opposition  at all. If there are Libyans abroad, they are miserable. Most  of them are businessmen. A large number of them returned,  carrying catalogs and business contacts from which we have  benefited. They enter and leave the country after they realized  that matters are different. They laughed at the conditions they  had been in. Even people who used to attack us over the radio  came and laughed at their previous conditions, admitting they  had been miserable and their statements were unreasonable. They  told us: Forgive us, and indeed we did when they entered the  country... Anyone who wants to return can return, and anyone who  repents is forgiven. God accepts repentance, so shouldn't human  beings do the same. Anyone who repents enters the country  safely. As for anyone who does not repent, his only option is  to become an agent for foreign intelligence, and this is what  has happened. One escaped after stealing the people's money and  another escaped to avoid military service and national  service.... These cases do not represent opposition. Opposition  takes place when there is colonialism in the country, when there  is dictatorship or exploitation.... This is opposition. But  when the people have the power, foreigners expelled, and the  homeland and the people are free, what do you call those who  escaped? Miserable. They are informers for U.S. intelligence.  They say things against their own people and their own  homeland, like hit Libya, boycott Libyan oil, or attack Libya.  What does this incitement mean? It means that intelligence  services tell them: say this. So they say it. They do not even  merit a question being put about them.</p>

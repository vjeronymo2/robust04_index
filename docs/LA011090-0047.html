			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: POP MUSIC / THOMAS K. ARNOLD: BAND TO PLAY HEARTS OUT TO  FUND YOUTH'S SURGERY  </P> <P> Robert Vaughn is no stranger to benefit concerts. Since his 1980 release from a  drug-rehabilitation program, the Point Loma rock 'n' roller and his band, the  Shadows, have been doing twice-yearly benefit shows for the local chapter of  Narcotics Anonymous.  </P> <P> The Shadows' July, 1987, record-preview party at the Radisson Hotel ballroom in  Mission Valley -- celebrating the release of the group's debut Island Records  album, "Love and War" -- raised $5,000 for a 3-year-old leukemia patient.  </P> <P> Saturday night, Vaughn and his band will throw another benefit concert, at the  Doubletree Hotel ballroom in Mission Valley. This time, the beneficiary is  Vaughn's own son, 5-year-old David, scheduled to undergo open-heart surgery in  June to correct a birth defect and a hole in the center of his heart.  </P> <P> "Coincidentally, I found out about it (his son's condition) the same day I did  the benefit for the little girl with leukemia," Vaughn said. "Now that a  surgery date has finally been set, we need to do something, because it's a  pre-existing condition, and we didn't have any insurance at the time he was  born."  </P> <P> Sharing the bill with Robert Vaughn and the Shadows will be two fellow Point  Loma bands, Fair Warning and Liquid Solution. Tickets to the concert are $10.  </P> <P> "Obviously, I don't expect to raise anywhere near the $65,000," said Vaughn,  referring to the cost of the operation and post-operative treatment. "I'm  contacting California Childrens Services and other charity organizations for  donations.  </P> <P> "But being in a band, I feel I'm in a somewhat privileged position to raise at  least some of the money myself."  </P> <P> With very few exceptions, San Diego bands -- particularly those that play  originals rather than Top 40 covers -- don't make nearly enough money plying  the bar scene. The only way to make ends meet is by moonlighting. Here are some  prominent local musicians, and their day jobs:  </P> <P> Anthony Sarain, flutist-saxophonist with tropical funk band Limbo Slam, is a  research engineer with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography's geophysics  department.  </P> <P> Robert Vaughn, singer-guitarist with rock band Robert Vaughn and the Shadows,  is a photo technician for Interocean Systems, which builds underwater cameras.  </P> <P> Tim Blankenship, bassist with speed-pop band the Pulltoys, operates a  pie-delivery service.  </P> <P> Bartley Mendoza, singer-guitarist with mod revivalists Manual Scan, is  assistant manager of the Fashion Valley Wherehouse record store.  </P> <P> Paul Massaro, drummer with speed-metalists Santa Claus, distributes fliers for  Fine Line Entertainment.  </P> <P> Bob Finch, acoustic bassist with Dixieland jazz band the Chicago Six, is a  teacher at Sunset High School in Encinitas.  </P> <P> Tom Teneover, singer-guitarist with eclectic new wavers Whei Whei T'Nango, is a  new-accounts representative at the Bankers Hill branch of Union Bank.  </P> <P> Burt Newman, bassist with oldies band the Mar Dels, is an assistant talent  buyer with Falk and Morrow Talent.  </P> <P> Paul Kamanski, singer-guitarist with roots rockers Comanche Moon, is a repo man  for Enterprise Rent-a-Car.  </P> <P> Buddy Blue, singer-guitarist with blue-eyed soulsters the Jacks, just took a  day job as a reporter with the La Jolla Light newspaper, covering the education  beat.  </P> <P> "It's impossible to make a reasonable amount of money in music in San Diego  unless you're a trendy deejay or a Top 40 band," said Blue, who's using his  real surname, Seigal, in print. "Luckily for me, music isn't the only creative  thing I do, so I don't have to go work in a McDonald's."  </P> <P> LINER NOTES: The Beat Farmers are working on a book that should prove an  invaluable traveling companion for touring bands, particularly novices. "The  Beat Farmers' Bowl Report" is a guide to public restrooms -- at gas stations,  truck stops, rest areas and greasy spoons -- encountered by the local roots  rockers on their last few U.S. tours. Facilities are rated in a number of  categories, including: quality of graffiti, privacy, cleanliness, acoustics,  condiments (toilet paper, seat covers, etc.), and condition of seat. No  publication date has been set. "It may take a couple more years of  investigative work, but it's coming along," said Beat Farmers drummer Country  Dick Montana. "Right now, we've already got about 150 (restrooms) rated." . . .  </P> <P> Musicians Who Care, the San Diego-based association of do- good musicians, is  launching a monthly magazine covering the local music scene. The premier issue  of "San Diego Music," modeled after Los Angeles' "Music Connection," is  scheduled to hit the streets in early March. . . .  </P> <P> Tickets go on sale Friday at 3 p.m. for the Sugarcubes' Feb. 17 appearance at  the California Theater, and Saturday at 10 a.m. for Melissa Etheridge's Feb. 16  concert at the California Theater. Tickets go on sale Jan. 15 at 10 a.m. for  Laurie Anderson's Feb. 15 concert at Symphony Hall. Tickets go on sale Jan. 20  at 10 a.m. for the March 2 Aerosmith and Skid Row show at the San Diego Sports  Arena. . . .  </P> <P> Best concert bets for the coming week: the Mamas and the Papas, Thursday at the  Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach; El Vez, Friday at the Casbah in Middletown;  D.R.I., also Friday, at Iguanas in Tijuana; and Marie Osmond, Saturday at the  Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa.  </P></p>

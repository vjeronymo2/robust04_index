			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / International Company News: Generali to establish Romanian venture GENERALI, Italy's biggest insurance company, moved a step back towards its central European roots with the signing yesterday of an accord to establish an insurance company in Romania. It will be working with the country's co-operative movement. Trieste-based Generali was a important force in the insurance business in eastern and central Europe before the communist takeover. The group, which is one of the largest insurers in Europe, already has an operation in Hungary. Generali is the first western insurer to return to the Romanian market. The new venture, to be called Generala Asigurari - the same name as Generali traded under until its activities were nationalised in 1947 - will be 51 per cent-owned by Generali. It should be operative by the start of next year. Its local partners in the venture, which it expects will run both life and non-life lines, are three co-operatives in the retail and financial sectors. The new insurance company will be able to use over 1,000 outlets of the co-operative movement, which has been active in Romania for over 140 years, and is an important part of the country's economic life. Generali gave no indication of how much it was investing in the venture.</p>

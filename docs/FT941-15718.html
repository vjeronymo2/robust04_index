			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Banco Popular climbs 7% Banco Popular, the Spanish bank more than 50 per cent-owned by non-Spanish institutional investors, yesterday reported net profits of Pta58bn (Dollars 401.5m) last year, a rise of 7.3 per cent on 1992. The results pleased analysts, who noted that Popular, which has high liquidity and is an important lender to small and medium-sized businesses, was particularly exposed last year to Spain's sharply falling interbank rate and to the enduring recession. The profits, however, continued the downward trend set last year when Popular posted a net income rise of 9.6 per cent against an increase of 15 per cent in 1991. The tightened margins, as interbank rates fell from 15 per cent to 9 per cent last year, were partly responsible for pushing Popular's return on equity down from 27.77 in 1992 to 25.55 in 1993. Strict credit control by the bank, together with poor domestic demand held growth in loans and discounts at the year end to just 1.5 per cent. Popular's non-performing loans were up 36 per cent to Pta55bn, against a rise of 28 per cent in 1992. They represented 2.9 per cent of total lending, a proportion which is well under half what is estimated for the domestic banking sector as a whole. Coverage of non-performing loans stood at 103.8 per cent over the mandatory requirements set by the Bank of Spain, against 110.1 per cent in 1992. Popular will pay a dividend of Pta790 per share, up from Pta730 in 1992.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] will review a plan, which Boeing Corporation of the  United States and Japanese aircraft manufacturers jointly have  been promoting, for the development of the next-generation  medium-sized passenger airplane (YXX). It will do so because  the YXX development plan became virtually dead in the wake of  Boeing Corporation's decision to give priority to the  development of new passenger airplane (737X), which will carry  almost the same number of passengers as the YXX. Starting in  fiscal 1994, the ministry wants to suspend the development plan  for the time being and ultimately start it afresh. The YXX  development plan is the first joint project, which Japan and the  Untied States started on equal terms. Together with a plan to  develop short-range medium-sized passenger airplane (YSX), it  has been considered as a pillar of Japan's aircraft development.    The YXX is a medium-sized passenger airplane, which can  carry  about 150 passengers. Japanese manufacturers, including  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries, and  Boeing Corporation started the joint development in 1981. The  Japanese Government and industries joined the project to take  over 25 percent of the share in the development project. So  far, they have conducted research to improve energy efficiency  of the aircraft and studied the trend of market demand for the  aircraft. MITI earmarked 613 million yen for the project in its  fiscal 1994 budget request.    MITI wants to start the YXX plan afresh because Boeing  Corporation officially decided recently to develop medium-sized  passenger airplane called 737X, which can carry from 100 to 160  passengers. It is an aircraft that will succeed the Boeing 737  series. More than 3,000 Boeing 737's have been sold so far.  Since it is not a completely new development project,  development costs of the 737X will be kept low. Also, it is  expected that the aircraft will be in great demand.    Because of this, MITI concluded that they cannot expect a  big  demand for the YXX and that the development of the YXX, which  will compete with the 737X, is not commercially feasible. MITI  plans to suspend the development starting in fiscal 1994 after  consulting with aircraft manufacturers and Japan Aircraft  Development Association, which acts as a contact point for the  YXX plan. MITI, which wants to start the project afresh  ultimately, plans to inform the Boeing Corporation of its  intention in the near future and call for its understanding.    Regarding the budget request, MITI will ask the Finance  Ministry for 500 million yen, which will be used to pay for the  interest of development expenses spent so far.</p>

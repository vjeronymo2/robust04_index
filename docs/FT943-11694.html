			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Sainsbury takes on Tesco in bid for Wm Low The price war between the UK's biggest food retailers yesterday became a bidding war as J. Sainsbury launched a counter-bid to Tesco's agreed offer for the Scottish supermarket chain William Low. Sainsbury's bid of 305p per share - the first time Britain's largest food retailer has made a hostile bid - values Wm Low at Pounds 210m, a 36 per cent premium to Tesco's offer of Pounds 154m, or 225p a share. Tesco said yesterday it was considering its response and urged Wm Low shareholders to take no action. Retailing analysts believe Tesco is likely to raise its offer to 325p per share, possibly as early as today. Expectations of a bidding war sent Wm Low's share price up 44p to 324p - almost double the 169p price of the shares on the day before Tesco's bid, two weeks ago. Sainsbury's shares rose 1p to 411p, but Tesco closed down 7p at 233p. Wm Low's directors said they would consider the Sainsbury offer in detail and were in talks with both bidders. A successful bid would raise Sainsbury's market share in Scotland from 3 per cent to 10 per cent, and give it 45 stores in Scotland, 12 in northern England, and a Scottish distribution depot. Mr David Sainsbury, chairman, said his company was 'in the strongest position to unlock the potential of Wm Low's stores'. He added: 'Our offer provides a fair price to Wm Low's investors and if accepted will provide a good return on investment to our shareholders.' Mr Sainsbury insisted the bid was effectively not 'hostile'. The Scottish supermarket chain, he added, had 'already endorsed an offer for its purchase. The only question now is who the purchaser will be and what the price will be'. Sainsbury is proposing a Pounds 40m investment to bring Wm Low's stores up to its own standards, and would assume Pounds 50m of debt. It said it would operate a regional office in Scotland, but this would be much smaller than Wm Low's head office, and 'significant job losses' among head office staff were likely. Sainsbury, advised by SG Warburg, is offering 305p in cash for each Wm Low ordinary share, and 143p for each convertible preference share. A share alternative is available. Analysts believe Tesco may respond with an offer as high as 350p per share to try to secure victory, but the consensus forecast is between 320p and 330p. They did not rule out a response by Sainsbury of 350p or above, but feared a bid at that level might be earnings-dilutive. 'The egos involved are quite substantial,' remarked one analyst. 'That could still push things a lot further.' Lex, Page 14 Sainsbury takes store wars into a new phase, Page 15</p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Ministers may act against big water bill rises MINISTERS may tell water companies to slow expensive improvements in order to avoid sharp increases in water bills. The proposal is likely to be part of the government's response to a report by Ofwat, the water regulator, to be published next Tuesday. Industry executives believe that the cost of industry improvements could be less than the Pounds 43bn estimated by Ofwat in a similar report last year. Mr David Luffrum, finance director of Thames Water, said yesterday: 'If within the law it is possible to spread out the spending then we and our customers would prefer that.' However, delaying some spending could bring the UK into conflict with Brussels and could prove politically contentious at home. Improvements to drinking and bathing water quality have been among the most popular European environmental rules, but the Ofwat report will fuel the growing debate in the UK about whether the cost is too high. One of the most controversial decisions facing ministers is whether to back measures to remove the remaining traces of lead in drinking water, even though this could cost Pounds 8bn. Water companies have projected that bills will need to rise by about 6 per cent above inflation between 1995 and 2000 to meet environmental rules. Next spring, in the first wide-ranging review of the industry's pricing structure since the 1989 privatisation, Ofwat will set price rises for 1995 to 2005. Yesterday Mr Jim Gardner, chairman of Ofwat's national customer council, called on the government to halt the increases in bills. He said that the results of recent customer surveys 'give a strong message to the companies and to government that customers are not prepared to pay even higher bills for slightly better services'. The estimate of Pounds 43bn in Ofwat's report, The Cost of Quality, did not include the elimination of lead in drinking water, nor the statutory water-quality objectives to be devised soon by the National Rivers Authority. This year's report is based on more detailed projections by the companies and on their customer surveys.</p>

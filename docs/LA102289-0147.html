			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STATISTIC BECOMES A REAL PERSON  </P> <P> As we stood by our Food for All display in front of a market in Costa Mesa last  week trying to encourage participation in Food for All by raising awareness of  hunger, a poignant encounter took place. A young woman showed interest in our  information.  </P> <P> The young woman commented that she hoped people would help soon because she was  looking for a place to find food on Saturday and Sunday. She told us she was  homeless, living in some bushes near a building, and had recently had a baby.  </P> <P> Suddenly this young mother was no longer a statistic to us, but a real person  with hurting eyes and an immediate problem of finding diapers and food on the  weekend, when most emergency feeding programs are shut down. We felt a little  better that at least we were able to tell her our church was preparing a dinner  at the Orange Coast Interfaith Shelter that evening. One meal would help, but  her problem remains.  </P> <P> This young woman is only one of the thousands who do not have a decent shelter  at night, and who, with her baby, is in need of food and help. With all the  rich blessings that many in Orange County enjoy, it is time for us as a society  to open our hearts.  </P> <P> Since 1987, Food for All has funded 16 agencies in Orange County who help the  hungry, with a total of $49,250 (a figure which is close to the median income  of just one Orange County household). While these contributions have helped,  when you consider our population of more than 2 million, it does seem we have  the potential for more giving to help the 360,000 who are at daily risk of not  having enough to eat.  </P> <P> HELEN ANDERSON  </P> <P> Tustin  </P></p>

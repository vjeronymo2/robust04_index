			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / OECD set for talks with five more states Ministers from the 25 nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development yesterday moved towards expanding the Paris-based body by approving negotiations on OECD membership with South Korea and four east European countries. A statement issued after the OECD's two-day annual ministerial meeting held out the prospect of Korea becoming a member by the end of 1996 and called for 'an early start' of negotiations on membership with the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. As a further indication of the OECD's increasingly outward-looking nature in the post-cold war world, the organisation and the Russian government yesterday agreed to step up the flow of economic assistance from the OECD to Russia. Under the terms of a joint declaration on co-operation, the OECD will develop a policy dialogue with Russia, assisting the design and implementation of economic reforms aimed at helping Russia build a market-based economy. This year's ministerial meeting was notable for the participation of Mexico, which joined the organisation as its first new member in more than two decades a few weeks ago. In their statement after the meeting, ministers said this marked 'the beginning of a new phase in the OECD's development'. The four former communist east European countries have applied formally to join the organisation. South Korea, which already participates in many of the OECD's committees and activities, intends to apply for membership this year with a view to joining in 1996. The OECD will examine the terms of Korea's membership as soon as Seoul is ready to do so. Separate negotiations with each of the four European applicants could begin soon. However, yesterday's statement gave no indication as to when they might be admitted to the organisation. Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the OECD secretary-general, said it was possible one or other of the east European countries might join the OECD at the same time as Korea. But the former communist states would have to adapt their legislation to meet the terms of membership as well as be acceptable to the existing member countries. Bulgaria, Romania and Slovenia have also asked the OECD for policy advice and the organisation may also help the Baltic states. The OECD intends to explore possibilities for co-operation with China and maintain its policy dialogue with the fast-growing newly-industrialising countries of Asia and Latin America. Yesterday, Mr Paye suggested Russia might one day become an OECD member. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, also urged Russia's integration with the west; it was 'the best investment we can make in our security and in the security of all the peoples of Europe'. According to Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister and one of the signatories of the agreement with Russia, the OECD intends 'to focus in particular on helping develop the legal and institutional infrastructure necessary for the functioning of a market economy in Russia.' The Paris-based body will carry out a comprehensive survey of the Russian economy and offer advice on economic restructuring and reform of Russia's tax and statistical systems. Russian experts will be invited to take part in specialised OECD committees. OECD officials will have access to senior Russian policy makers and to the economic information needed for drawing up a programme for Russia. They will be given the same legal status and protection as officials of other international economic organisations. Russia has been receiving OECD economic assistance since 1991 on a wide range of issues, including statistics, privatisation, competition policy, financial sector reform and social security. The agreement signed yesterday will intensify this co-operation.</p>

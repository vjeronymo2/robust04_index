			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at the signing </F> ceremony of the Israeli-Palestinian Self-Rule Agreement at the  International Convention Center in Cairo -- live; passages  within slantlines in English]    [Text] /The president of Egypt, President Mubarak; the  cosponsors: the secretary of state of the United States, the  Foreign Minister Kozyrev of Russia; Chairman 'Arafat, the  chairman of the PLO; foreign ministers; distinguished guests;  members of the committees that worked so hard to produce what  has been done and signed at this stage; the citizens of Israel;  the Palestinian people: First, I would like to join in the many  happy returns for your birthday; it will take you addition many  years to reach my age.    /I am not.... [pauses] How to put it? We witnessed, you  witnessed, the world witnessed the tip of the iceberg of  problems that we shall have to overcome in the implementation of  even the first phase of the Declaration of Principles [DOP]. To  overcome 100 years of animosity, suspicion, bloodshed, it's not  so simple. There is an opposition on both sides to what we are  doing today, and it will require a lot, a lot on both sides to  make sure that we will succeed and achieve peaceful coexistence  and, in addition to the coexistence, to bring a permanent  solution.    /Today we signed the Gaza-Jericho First agreement, which is  the first phase of implementation. It's a very daring project,  and we are committed by signature today to make sure that it  will work. We will achieve our goals; we will be able to  overcome all these problems. You have heard many different  speeches. Allow me, after saying what I have said by now, to  turn in Hebrew to the people of Israel./    In 1889, 105 years ago, Avraham Jablonsky, a blacksmith, was  murdered in his clay hut in Wadi Khalil. Avraham Jablonsky was  the first victim in the history of the Jewish settlement in  Eretz Yisra'el in modern times. He was the first victim of the  bloody conflict between us and the Palestinian people since our  return to the land of our forefathers after 2,000 years of  exile. Since Avraham Jablonsky's death, the experience of our  grandparents, parents, ourselves, and even our children and  grandchildren has been almost solely one of blood and  bereavement. For 100 years, this blood gave us no rest. What  did we want? We wanted to return to the land of our  forefathers, to the land of the Bible. We wanted a homeland; we  wanted a home; we wanted a safe haven; we wanted a place to call  our own; we wanted to live as all men live, to be like other  nations. We wanted to live.    The war for the land of our forefathers took our best sons  and daughters. It drained us of spiritual and physical energies  and channeled our entire spiritual and physical existence to  paths we did not want, to paths of pain. We deplore that. Even  in our most difficult times, our hearts ached at the sights of  devastation, hatred, and death. Even in our most bitter  moments, we knew that the tears of a bereaved mother from within  our midst are no different from the tears of another bereaved  mother; that they are equally piercing and painful in any  family; that the cries of despair are the same even when uttered  in other languages.    We decided to try to put an end to this terrible circle of  pain. We decided to look ahead at a different future. On 13  September 1993, on the White House lawn in Washington, we  decided to embark on a new road. Tomorrow we will begin  implementing the DOP. The DOP and its implementation -- in Gaza  and Jericho, at this point -- is designed to attain a dual  purpose: to enable the Palestinian authority to administer the  lives of the Palestinians and to uphold public law and order in  their places of residence. Our goal is to uphold security for  Israelis wherever they may be, particularly in the wake of the  change that is scheduled to take place in Gaza and Jericho. If  the security of the Israelis is not ensured and if the  Palestinians are not given new hope, the goal of the agreement  will not be attained.    A great deal depends on the Palestinians. We are embarking  on this new road with a lot of hope and with strong will, and we  know that it entails wonderful chances as well as serious risks.  We are convinced that both peoples can live on the same strip  of land, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, as the  Biblical prophets envisioned; to give this land, the land of  stones and graves, the taste of milk and honey it deserves.    At this hour, I appeal to the Palestinian people and say to  them: Palestinian neighbors, 100 bloody years have instilled in  us hatred for each other. For 100 years, we wanted to see you  dead and you wanted to see us dead. We killed you and you  killed us. Thousands of our graves and yours dot the mountains  and the valleys, and they are painful landmarks in your history  and ours. Today, you and we are extending our hands in peace.  Today we are opening a new account. The Israeli people expect  you not to let them down. Let the new hope flourish. It is not  easy to forget the past, but let us try to overcome the rancors  and obstacles in order to open a new, unique, and historic  horizon; an opportunity which may never recur for a different  life, a life that is not fraught with fear, a life that is not  fraught with hatred, a life that does not involve the frightened  eyes of children, a life that does not entail pain, a life in  which we will build a home, plant a vineyard, and live to a ripe  old age alongside our fellow men.    Tomorrow morning, we all hope to awaken to a new day, to  awaken to a new future and a new chance for our children. For  their sake, it was necessary to fight; for their sake, it is  vital to reach peace.    I thank all those who lent us a hand and helped us get to  this day: the heads of state and statesmen; the soldiers who  fought and the soldiers we hope will not have to fight.    /A special thanks to our host, to the president of Egypt,  President Mubarak, the leader of the great Arab country that set  the precedent that peace can be achieved, peace can be  maintained, peace can bring peoples together. [applause]    /Allow me to thank to the secretary of state of the United  States, a true friend of Israel; and the foreign minister of  Russia; to the representatives of Norway; and to others that  assisted so much./    On a spring day of 1994, two weeks ago, the late Second  Lieutenant Shahar Simani was murdered. He was 21 years old and  a resident of Ashqelon. His bullet-riddled body was found by  the roadside on the way to Jerusalem. A thread of blood links  the Israeli people from the murder of Avraham Jablonsky, the  blacksmith, 105 years ago to the murder of 2d. Lt. Shahar Simani  two weeks ago. I pray: May Shahar Simani be the last fatality  among all of us, Israelis and Palestinians.    The new hope we are taking with us as we leave this place is  immeasurable. There is no limit to our goodwill, to the will to  see a historic reconciliation between two peoples that have  lived so far by their swords. In the alleyways of Khan Yunus  and on the outskirts of Ramat Gan, in the houses of Gaza, in the  squares of Hadera, Rafah, and 'Afula, a new reality is being  born today. One hundred years of the Palestinian-Israeli  conflict and millions of people who want to live are watching  us. May God be with us. [applause]</p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Teachers to vote on banning tests TEACHERS in England and Wales yesterday neared outright conflict with the government over controversial national curriculum tests. The executive of the NASUWT, the second-largest teachers' union, voted to ballot its 127,000 members on a boycott of all tests this year. The tests are due to be sat by seven and 14-year-olds in state schools from April. The union will seek next Tuesday the support of the other five teachers' unions. All have expressed serious reservations about this year's tests for 14-year-olds, which are to be compulsory for the first time. The tests in English, to take place in June, have caused particular controversy. The last of the prescribed texts have only recently been received by schools, and sample questions have still to reach many teachers. Teachers say this has left insufficient time to prepare pupils. There is also opposition to the publication of test results, which may lead to school league tables like those issued by the government for this year's tests for seven-year-olds. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NASUWT general secretary, said: 'Teachers know their pupils are being used by the government. They know that the tests have not been properly piloted, that set texts have been announced piecemeal after the year has begun and spending decisions have been made.' Of the other unions, the National Union of Teachers, the largest, is most likely to join the NASUWT in pressing for a boycott. An NUT survey of teachers involved in the English tests, released earlier this week, showed nine out of 10 respondents in favour of a boycott. Baroness Blatch, schools minister, described claims that the tests had not been properly prepared as 'ridiculous', and pointed to pilots 'involving hundreds of schools and thousands of pupils' over the past 2 1/2 years. Mr de Gruchy said the boycott would 'definitely go ahead' if he secured a 'clear-cut majority'. It would probably start in April. Possible courses of government action in response are unclear - particularly when education authorities, headteachers and governors are all sympathetic. In spite of threatened boycotts, the introduction of tests for seven-year-olds in 1991 proceeded without disruption. Mr de Gruchy said his union was not opposed to 'sensible testing and assessment'.</p>

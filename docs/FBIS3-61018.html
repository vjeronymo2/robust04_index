One of them was the flights of the Zenit reconnaissance  satellites. The work on those started in 1956, even before the  launch of the first artificial Earth satellite in the world,  with design-flight testing in 1962 and standard operations in  1963. These spacecraft (later modifications of them) served more  than 20 years. One of their developers, Yuriy Mikhaylovich  Frumkin, talks about the first Zenit.    Zenit is a heavy satellite intended for the performance of  detailed photographic reconnaissance, equipped with three  cameras with a lens focal length of F = one meter, one  topographic camera (F = 0.2 meter) and radio reconnaissance gear.    The cameras were able to take pictures in a small series of  frames and in long paths. The width of the photographed strip in  satellite flight at an orbital altitude of H = 200 km  [kilometers] was 180 km. Long-focus apparatus provided a  resolution of the pictures equal to 10--12 meters, with the film  supply sufficient for each spacecraft to take 1,500 frames.    The duration of the flight of the satellite, as confirmed by  flight-design testing, was 8--12 days. The data obtained by the  radio reconnaissance gear and telemetric information on the  functioning of on-board systems, the power plant and structural  elements was transmitted to Earth in radio communications  sessions. The exposed film was returned to Earth together with  the camera in a descent section (SA). Flight control was  accomplished from the Control Center, with the participation of  many ground and floating command and telemetry stations. Special  ground services and aircraft also provided for the retrieval and  appropriate delivery of the descent section that had landed.    The Zenit consists of two major sections--the instrument  section (PO) and the SA. They are connected by a host of  electrical, hydraulic and other types of communications. The  descent section has a spherical shape with an outer covering of  heat-protective coating. The strong and airtight metallic  covering, with thermal protection applied to it, has three large  hatches. The cover of one of them is jettisoned to open the  parachutes as it reaches the ground. The other two are  technological hatches, and provide for the installation of  apparatus and equipment. The cover of one holds the portholes  for the camera gear. The PO is made in the form of two conical  fairings linked by a cylindrical insert. It is destroyed and  burns up during passage through the atmosphere with the descent  section returning from orbit. The configuration of the Zenit  spacecraft and its mass, shape of the SA and basic functional  systems in descent and landing are very close to those on the  Vostok spacecraft. Despite their outward similarity (they were  developed at roughly the same time), however, they have  substantial differences (Fig. 1).   <FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-002C-11A>           Fig. 1. Specific features of the structural </FIG>          The specific nature of the tasks performed by the Zenit  spacecraft presupposed fitting it with equipment based on new  systems or considerably upgraded from the Vostok spacecraft. A  new and quite complex project, requiring the resolution of a  large number of problematical scientific and technical issues,  was the special apparatus for photographic and radio  reconnaissance. Apparatus was created with long-focus lenses.  The specific features of its operation through multiple-pane  portholes bearing internal pressure, the effects of  weightlessness and other factors of flight, along with the small  volume of the SA, were all taken into account therein. It was  moreover necessary to ensure the high reliability of the  apparatus, a broad range of adjustment characteristics, high  resolution of the pictures obtained and precision in referencing  them to the terrain.    Fundamental difficulties arose in the development of the  system for orienting the spacecraft. It was necessary to have a  virtually constant, precise three-axis orientation in the  orbital system of coordinates in order to photograph the Earth's  surface and obtain high-quality images, with one of those axes  tracking the direction of the Earth in the orbital movement of  the craft. The Zenit craft was able to realize this mode during  flight testing for the first time in space science. The  orientation system performed "rapid" programmed revolutions  across a wide range of angles in order to expand the  opportunities to obtain photographic information from the  satellite, which made it possible to take pictures of areas  located at a considerable distance from the flight path of the  satellite. The orientation of the system was structured on the  basis of fundamentally new optical and gyroscopic sensors, using  logic blocks with a complex functional algorithm and  multiple-nozzle control elements with economical modes for the  consumption of the working medium (nitrogen). The principal  units of this system were located in the instrument section,  while the micromotors, tanks with the reserves of the working  medium and optical sensors were mounted on its outer surface.    The control system for the on-board complex that provided  the  logic and electric-power control of all on-board apparatus was  also qualitatively altered. The necessity of flexibility in the  operational control of the photographic gear, its adjustment  depending on the flight altitude, illumination of the Earth's  surface, location, planned length of the picture track and much  more required the creation of a complex program-logic device  with a radiotechnical channel for the on-board program radio  line. This was an innovation in the radiotechnical systems of  spacecraft.    A number of difficult problems had to be solved by the  developers of the system to maintain the thermal conditions of  the satellite. The long-focus camera set the terms, since the  quality of the pictures and their resolution were directly  dependent on the range and rate of change of the temperature of  the lens, the camera as a whole and the porthole. The  maintenance of the temperature of the gas with a precision of  about one degree posed a difficult engineering task in the face  of the marked fluctuations in the values of the internal and  external thermal fluxes.    The Zenit, as a secret device, had to meet special  requirements, and systems were thus included in it for  self-destruction in emergency situations (emergency detonation  of the craft) and radio telemetry for the radio reconnaissance  gear, as well as a means of protecting the information etc.    The design engineering of the Zenit spacecraft was performed  on the basis of broad cooperation among scientific-research and  experimental-design enterprises and major centers equipped with  complex systems and devices for the experimental ground  run-through of the satellite as a whole and its systems and  assemblies, in close interaction with the customer, the Ministry  of Defense, including using test-range services as well as the  Kuybyshev OKB-1 [Experimental Design Bureau 1], to which all of  the work on this type of spacecraft was transferred upon  completion of the program of flight-design testing. The lead  organization was Experimental-Design Bureau No. 1 (OKB-1),  headed by S. Korolev.    Design research went on for two years (starting in 1956),  and  concluded with the selection of a configuration for the  reconnaissance satellite and its principal flight and  engineering characteristics, as well as the composition and  operating principles of its on-board systems.    The return of the exposed film from orbit to Earth in a  special capsule was envisaged therein. It was to have a  relatively small mass, conical shape and be equipped, aside from  the film cassettes, with the minimally necessary means to ensure  the physical preservation of the film in flight in the  atmosphere and in landing, as well as to find the landing  location.    The second section of the satellite was designed to be  larger. Its shape varied from cylindrical, with small conical or  spherical ends, to a combination of complex shapes. This  configuration was selected because an opportunity appeared,  while reducing the dimensions and mass of the section to return  to Earth and the required mass of the satellite as a whole, to  increase the period of its active existence and the volume and  quality of the information obtained. This was achieved through  the installation of more advanced gear, an increase in the film  supply and the working medium for the orientation system, and  larger-capacity batteries for the electric-power system.    At roughly the same time, starting in 1958, the OKB-1  launched work on the creation of the Vostok manned spacecraft.  It was designed in two sections of roughly equal mass--an SA  that was spherical in shape, and a PO whose outer contours were  two cones, with articulated bases. The same configuration was  adopted for the reconnaissance satellite under real "pressure"  from S. Korolev.    This was not a simple solution, since the descent section  was  adapted to accommodate a person rather than the equipment of a  reconnaissance satellite. The insistence of the Chief Designer  and the inventiveness of the participants in the project  nonetheless made it possible to solve this problem.    The Zenit (Fig. 2) as a result came to consist of an  instrument section and a descent section with dimensions close  to those of the Vostok spacecraft.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-002C-12A>           Fig. 2. Zenit-2 spacecraft </FIG>          The PO accommodated units for the orientation system, the  control of on-board systems, electric-power supply, thermostatic  gear, radio systems and radio reconnaissance gear, among others.  Its external surfaces had a host of antennas for the electronic  gear, an optical sensor for orientation to the sun--used in one  of the satellite turning modes before the issue of the braking  command to descend from orbit--and an infrared vertical  reference, which could also be used for orientation before  descent from orbit. There were also rocket motors for  orientation and tanks with the gas supply. The braking engine  installation from the design bureau of A. Isayev and the  radiator of the thermal-regulation system were also located in  the lower section.    The descent section housed, aside from the camera, the  landing system (a parachute system, automatic devices and  sensors), means of electric-power supply, control of on-board  systems, thermal regulation, radio stations to get a bearing on  the SA, and a system for the autonomous recording of the  readings of a number of sensors monitoring the process of the  flight during the descent. A system for the emergency detonation  of the craft was also installed in the SA (a charge, logic unit  and sensors), which destroyed the contents of the descent  section in the event emergency situations arose.    The transition to the new configuration, through an  inconsiderable deviation from the configuration of the  reconnaissance satellite optimized from a mass standpoint, made  it possible to reduce the spending for its flight testing, since  the important stages--deorbiting, descent and landing--had been  worked out in testing of unmanned satellites and in the first  manned flights of the Vostok spacecraft.    The flight and design testing confirmed the correctness of  the decision made in 1958. This was one of many examples of the  intuition and ability of the Chief Designer to evaluate problems  broadly and comprehensively in the development of complex space  projects. The results of the design engineering were formulated  in the middle of 1961. The satellite had already been  manufactured by this time, had completed a full cycle of ground  run-through and was at the Baykonur cosmodrome. The flight and  design testing was completed with the flight of a Zenit launched  on 19 December 1963 under the name Kosmos-20.    COPYRIGHT: "Aviatsiya i kosmonavtika", 1993.</p>

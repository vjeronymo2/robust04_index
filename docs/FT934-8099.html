			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Personal View: Nafta a launch pad for Latin America The world truly has turned upside down. Thirty years ago, Latin American governments were sternly admonished by their Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development counterparts to open their economies to world trade and let the market work its wonders. The Latin Americans obstinately stayed the course of import substitution, often behind excessively high barriers of protection blended with state interventionism. Today, the Latin American countries are the ones that are unilaterally following trade liberalisation policies, combined with a greater respect for the 'right prices', while many OECD countries indulge in various forms of protectionism and maintain artificial prices for numerous agricultural products. Thirty years ago, the conventional wisdom was that developing countries could not compete with the superior economies of scale and the technological and organisational capacity of companies in the industrialised world. To penetrate markets in developed economies, those countries demanded non-reciprocal preferential treatment as the only way to diversify exports away from basic commodities (agricultural and mineral): the General System of Preferences was hailed in Latin America as a big breakthrough in the rules that govern the international trading system. Today, most Latin American countries have joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and those that have not are in the process of doing so. Demands for non-reciprocal preferential treatment are no longer in fashion, since unilateral liberalisation has, in fact, imposed on the region's companies the imperative of competing in the world market. Today, rather, we hear voices in highly developed countries claiming that their own companies cannot compete with low-cost labour and standards or permissive environmental rules, or even alleged or real comparative advantages which they attribute to developing countries. Never mind that developed countries lead the way in the comparative advantages that really matter in world trade today - capacity to innovate, to adapt and to organise. The opponents of a more open international trading system seem to fear the comparative advantages that weigh less and less in world trade, primarily the cost of labour. The North American Free Trade Agreement is, among other things, a testing ground for this profound change in north-south perceptions regarding competitiveness and trade policies. Neither Mexican nor US nor Canadian authorities view the arrangement as a substitute or stumbling block for the international trading system sought in the Uruguay Round, but rather as a complement or a building block. For that reason, the agenda and the procedures of Nafta closely parallel those of the multilateral trade negotiations. The distance covered by Mexico, from resisting even the suggestion in the early 1980s that it join Gatt to forming part of a free trade zone with the US and Canada in 1993, is nothing short of mind-boggling. Contrary to what could reasonably be expected, Mexican companies' opposition first to unilateral trade liberalisation and then to joining Nafta has been mild. In contrast, North Americans have been alerted to the 'giant sucking sound' of Mexico's comparative advantages drawing productive activities away from their northern neighbours, and important constituencies have been mobilised in opposition to Nafta. Rationality dictates that, while there will be winners and losers on both sides of the border, in the end all parties will be better off, thanks to the improved allocation of resources and enhanced growth promoted by freer trade. Opponents of the agreement score points by focusing only on the losers and on the short term. What is at stake from the Latin American perspective is enormous. Numerous Latin American countries are standing in the wings, waiting to join what they perceive as an important building block for a more open international trading system. Failure to ratify the treaty would mean not only a missed opportunity for greater prosperity in Canada, the US and Mexico - admittedly, at the cost of short-term disruptions for all concerned - but would also signal an unwillingness on the part of the electorate of the world's most important economic player to move closer to the international trading system envisaged in the original objectives of the Uruguay Round. That would be a sad day not only for Mexico, and even all of Latin America, but also for the global community of nations.

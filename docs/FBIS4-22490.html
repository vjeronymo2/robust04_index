			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ivan Zhagel, IZVESTIYA correspondent: "The </F> Association of Russian Banks Protests Against the Central Bank's  Decision"]    [Text] As before the decision of the Central Bank to  introduce a minimum rate of up to 2 billion rubles for the  charter capital of banks being newly registered, beginning 1  March, with its subsequent increase up to a rate equivalent to 5  million ecu (at the present exchange rate--up to R10 billion),  remains the most acute problem in the Russian banking  sphere.    After a long silence the Association of Russian Banks has  expressed its attitude toward this problem. A few days ago it  sent a letter to the State Duma in which it essentially demands  the repeal or the suspension of the operation of the pertinent  Central Bank directive.    In the opinion of the association's board of management,  although the need to increase the internal resources of the  banks under conditions of rapid inflation is obvious, "this  process should be gradual, taking into account the actual  resources of the banks and the needs of the economy." Under the  present specific conditions the raising of a charter capital of  R2 billion is a task beyond one's strength. There are simply no  such resources in the majority of oblasts, krays and cities. In  this connection new banks will not be created in the next few  years and part of those already in operation will be closed down.    And this given the fact that 27 oblasts and republics now  have less than 10 banks each. Because of this each banking  institution serves several rayons. For example, in Novgorod  Oblast, which is made up of 22 rayons, there are only three  banks and eight branches and in the 40 rayons of Kirov  Oblast--seven banks and 17 branches. Naturally, in this case  there can be no question of any competition in the banking  sphere or of any quality of banking service.    As to the question of a further increase of charter capital,  it also appears moot to the Association of Russian Banks. The  fact is that there are now in Russia only 28 banks with a  declared charter fund of more than R5 billion. And even for them  bringing internal capital up to R10-12 billion is a rather  complicated task.</p>

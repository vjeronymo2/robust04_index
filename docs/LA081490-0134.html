			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT;  </P> <P> RESIDENTS WAIL OVER EDISON SIREN PLAN  </P> <P> Another case of the NIMBY -- Not in My Back Yard -- syndrome has surfaced, this  time in the hillside community of Monarch Bay Terrace.  </P> <P> Rather than jails or landfills, however, the object of homeowner concern is  Southern California Edison Co.'s plan to install two emergency sirens. The  sirens, part of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station warning system, were  to be perched atop two 50-foot poles on Caribbean Drive until homeowners  association representatives began complaining.  </P> <P> Both the location and the sound level of the sirens have been issues in the  community that overlooks Monarch Bay and Salt Creek Beach. The association has  promised to take its case to the City Council tonight.  </P> <P> "These sirens will be standing in front of some of our residents' views and  right at the level of our bedrooms," said Richard Dombrow, an attorney and  former president of the association. "It's ludicrous, really. These things do  not have to be placed in the middle of our neighborhood."  </P> <P> The sirens would be the last of 50 devices that make up the nuclear station's  emergency-warning network. The other 48 are scattered throughout the South  County area in a 10-mile radius around the generating station just south of San  Clemente, according to Edison spokesman David Barron. Six sirens are located in  Dana Point, he added.  </P> <P> The Monarch Bay Terrace location is actually outside the federally mandated  emergency zone, but Dana Point officials decided to make the zone contiguous  with the city borders, said Ed Knight, the city's director of development.  </P> <P> "These things are about as obtrusive as a street light," Knight said. "There's  one near City Hall that was tested last September, and it sounds like any other  siren. Maybe in the subdivision right below the pole, it could rattle the tiles  a little."  </P> <P> The sirens are designed to be a warning to anyone within earshot to turn on  their radios or televisions for further emergency information, Barron said.  Dombrow questioned the need for a warning siren at all for areas very close to  the nuclear plant.  </P> <P> "If the siren is telling us about an earthquake, we'll already know about  that," he said. "If it's warning us about a nuclear problem, well, it will  probably be too late for us by the time we hear it." LEN HALL  </P></p>

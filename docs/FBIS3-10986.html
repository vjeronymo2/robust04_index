More than 3,000 Belizean soldiers are maintaining permanent  surveillance along the alleged [supuesta] borderline. In fact,  they built a wide highway that allows them to move easily from  Cayo San Ignacio to Corozal, which is near the area that borders  Peten.    It was reported that soldiers from the former colony  frequently enter Peten territory and that they even harass  peasants who have lived and worked there for many years.    Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel has started an  anti-Guatemalan  campaign and ordered the expulsion of numerous families with  years of residence in the territories under dispute although  many of them already filed requests before the immigration  authorities to reside legally in Belize.    In order to win support within the Belizean community,  Esquivel maintains a hostile attitude toward Guatemalans and  points out that there could be an invasion anytime.    In a recent meeting with Queen of England Elizabeth II,  Esquivel advised the sovereign on the need to maintain English  troops in the former colony, but his efforts were unsuccessful.  The monarch, however, assured him that the British will use the  Belizean jungle as a training ground for some soldiers.    Peten authorities in Melchor de Mencos said that Guatemala  maintains minimal surveillance along the border and this could  facilitate new incursions by Belizean soldiers. They added that  more than 3,000 Guatemalans have been expelled since Esquivel  became Belizean president, although his grandparents hail from  San Miguel, a town across from the Island of Flores. Esquivel  also admitted that he has relatives residing in Santa Elena (a  Peten community) but has never met them. The authorities noted  that his hostile attitude toward Guatemalans is inexplicable.</p>

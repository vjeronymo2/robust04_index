			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / People: Brent picks Dobbie Sandy Dobbie, 42, has been appointed chief operating officer of Brent International, the speciality chemical maker which cut its dividend recently following a collapse in its profits. Dobbie's appointment almost completes the boardroom reshuffle at Brent International which began last August when chief executive Stephen Cuthbert, 51, quit following mounting City concern about the company's lack-lustre performance. Keith Hutchings, 46, Brent's former finance director, was confirmed as chief executive in March and Bill Jessup, 42, who used to work at Brent, has returned as finance director. Dobbie will start by taking over Dennis Wilby's role heading Brent's industrial chemicals operations and will add responsibility for the printing services side at a later stage. Wilby, 46, has been an executive director of Brent for eight years and his future role has yet to be settled by Brent's new management team. Dobbie, who has a doctorate in organic chemistry from Glasgow University, will complement Hutchings's financial background. He started his career as an industrial chemist and switched into production management. He joins Brent from Merck's speciality chemicals subsidiary Kelco International where he has been managing director for almost four years. The changes in Brent's boardroom are not confined to the executive team. Lord Lane, 69, a former senior partner of chartered accountants BDO Binder Hamlyn, steps down next year after ten years as Brent's chairman and hands over to Alec Daly, 58, an executive director of GKN. Meanwhile, Adrian Burn, managing partner of BDO Binder Hamlyn, joined the board as a non-executive director last month following the retirement of David Swallow and John Jones. Brent plans to add another non-executive director at some stage.</p>

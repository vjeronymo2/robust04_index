			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Anders Sundstrom, Social Democratic Party </F> member, by Margaret von Platen in Pitea; date not given:  "Clinton Provides Inspiration for Social Democrats"]    [Text] Pitea -- If the Social Democrats win the  parliamentary elections in the fall, then the new government's  economic policy will be inspired by the United States and  President Clinton's government. Many Social Democrats have  recently visited the United States, including Willy Bergstrom,  Mona Sahlin, Allan Larsson, Par Nuder.[.sup]1[/] Anders  Sundstrom will also try to squeeze in a trip to the United  States before September. He is a local councillor in Pitea and  the party's spokesman on economic policy. In a new Social  Democratic government he will probably be the economic affairs  minister. Anders Sundstrom wants greater centralization and  planning in the style of Bill Clinton -- but with a few homespun  ideas from Pitea. His plan for economic policy includes  sectoral planning, control over research, a technical and  scientific council, and an investment bank.    [Sundstrom] I do not think it was very clever to close down  the National Investment Bank. Ericsson's CEO Lars Ramqvist has  reported that the success of the mobile telephone market was due  to cofinancing with the Investment Bank. I am not promising to  introduce a new investment bank -- we would need money to do  that. However, I thought it operated well. I have looked at how  it used to work and I am impressed.    [von Platen] How important is it for a Social Democratic  government to gain the confidence of the markets and major  companies so that investments are made in Sweden?    [Sundstrom] I believe it will be hard for us to get the  bosses of major companies to say that a Social Democratic  government is better than a government supported by the Swedish  Employers' Confederation. However, I do not believe that anyone  will leave Sweden merely because of our rise to power.  Companies have not had a great time of it under the right-wing  government.    [von Platen] Are there limits to what a Social Democratic  government can do?    [Sundstrom] The main constraint for the state is its  economic  room for maneuver. We cannot present any proposals that would  increase the budget deficit.    [von Platen] Why do you consider Swedish membership of the  EU  [European Union] to be so important?    [Sundstrom] Sweden will never be attractive to investors if  it remains outside of Europe.    [von Platen] What kind of emergency plan have the Social  Democrats made if the people say no to EU membership in the  referendum?    [Sundstrom] The Social Democrats have no ready-made plan of  what to do if we do not become members.    [von Platen] What have you learned from the financial  crisis?    [Sundstrom] That inflationary economies lead investors  astray. [Sundstrom ends]    His economic policy looks something like this. Its  objectives are: to make it easier for small companies to get  their hands on capital; to investigate the banks' high profit  margins; to establish aid for small companies in the private  sector that are facing competition; to allow the state and  companies to finance several projects jointly.    [Sundstrom continues] As economics minister I shall ensure  that small companies can make the most of their competitiveness  on the capital market. Small companies in Pitea know that they  are obliged to use their bank in Pitea. That is not how things  should be. I believe that there is weak competition on the  banking market. Specialized banks will be set up. Information  on them will be available in data bases. It is wrong that small  companies should have to pay interest rates between 4 and 5  percent higher than large companies -- despite the fact that  small companies are highly solvent. Nowadays, subsidies for  enterprise are rather too general. For example, if a  hairdresser gets a subsidy to open up his own salon and then  drives someone else out of business, then we have not achieved  very much. Small companies faced with competition at  international level must be given help to grow.    A great deal of support is being given to companies, but it  is being managed by the wrong people and flowing through the  wrong channels. Several hundred million kronor are being lost  on the way. For instance, the aid awarded to inventors at  national level is less than that awarded by Vasterbotten alone.  Cofinanced projects are totally lacking in Sweden. The state  must support new companies, helping them to develop new  production capacities. However, the state must not take a share  unless it does so via guarantees and loans, just as in the  United States.    I will increase export subsidies for small companies. Today,  export credit guarantees work well for large companies, but not  so well for the smaller ones.    The Social Democratic Party will become more active and  develop sectoral programs for areas in which Sweden has unique  growth opportunities, both in terms of resources and the climate  of innovation. For instance, some German states have sectoral  programs to supply venture capital. We have already indicated  that in view of its significance for the balance on our current  account, forests and the lumber industry comprise a priority  branch.    As economic minister, I will strengthen Nutek, the  industrial  authority. There must be a central authority for research and  development. Today, there are too many state authorities  without any semblance of unity. For instance, it is wrong to  take the workers' funds in several independent foundations for  research purposes. The shares in Atle and Bure should be in one  hand. Aid awarded under the terms of economic policy aid is  split. There is no strong single authority.    I will facilitate access to venture capital for innovations  before they are marketed, and I shall allocate more funds to  industrial research. Other countries have resources to develop  their inventions. Take Japan. We are net exporters of  inventions.    Sweden ranks last, together with Turkey and Greece, as far  as  support for industrial research is concerned. The present  government has vacillated, cutting grants for technical  attaches. However, we need scouts throughout the world looking  out for new inventions.    I intend to make universities into centers where ideas can  be  commercialized. Someone, for example the prime minister himself  or someone close to him, will be responsible for resources  earmarked for training. Today, these funds are distributed by  various departments. Growth-related issues will be grouped  together.    I have my eye on the United States. President Clinton  presides over a technical and scientific council that has the  same status as the National Security Council or defense council.    At present, training is only being done by major companies.  I want to stimulate small companies into offering training,  too. This will be based on the same principle as the  occupational funds.    [von Platen] Which country has the best policy for  supporting  small companies?    [Sundstrom] Germany and northern Italy have developed very  well. What fascinates me there is the entrepreneurial spirit.  Over there it is a good thing to be an entrepreneur. Here in  the town, the inhabitants of Pitea are proud of entrepreneurs.  It is important that we, as leaders, call attention to them and  say that they are important for our nation and municipality.  [Sandtrom ends]    Pitea District Councillor Anders Sundstrom is one of the  Social Democrats' future stars and one of the candidates most  certain to receive a post in the new government. However, he  will not enter parliament in the fall, even if the party wins  the election. He is not on any list in the parliamentary  election. He himself explains this by saying that he prefers to  stay home with his sons, who are 10 and 13 years old. However,  it is also well known that he is not very popular among all  Social Democrats in the north. He is not a candidate on the  Norrbotten parliamentary list because Boden threatened to set up  its own parliamentary list -- without Anders Sundstrom, because  the people living there do not like him. In a compromise  between Boden and Lulea, he decided that the new hospital should  be located between the two towns. It turned out to cost 100  million kronor more than it would have cost to rebuild the old  hospital in Boden. In the course of that conflict he lost some  popularity.    Anders Sundstrom comes from the small town of Sikras in the  district of Kalix. His father's father was a fisherman, farmer,  and longshoreman. He founded the transport department and the  first Social Democratic association in the district.  Sundstrom's father was an electrician who worked for the  customs authority and then became a teacher at the vocational  school in Pitea.    Judgements of Anders Sundstrom vary. He is Ingvar Carlsson's  favorite, but weak and sensitive; he is clever, and has created  a whole new economic climate in Pitea; he is no visionary, he is  fairer than the other Social Democrats, and can take critcism;  he has done his homework and asks smart questions in the  committees on which he sits.    However, when I asked the taxi drivers what Anders Sundstrom  is doing for them as self-employed people -- Sundstrom has been  voted the most popular district councillor in the business world  -- I received only negative answers. The taxi drivers are  furious with him: In a public call for tenders to run  transportation services for old-age pensioners the "wrong"  company won out. One of the owners of the winning taxi company  sits alongside Sundstrom in the social committee's working group.    Anders Sundstrom became a district councillor in Pitea at  age  27 -- Sweden's youngest ever. Now he is 42 years old and still  in the same post. He is a member of some 10 boards of  directors, including in Alvsbyhus (Sweden's most progressive  housing company), in the NAB (technical consultants), and  PITEATIDNINGEN (the town's only -- and Social Democratic --  newspaper). Until the change in government, he was also a board  member of Doman, LKAB, and Vattenfall. In addition, he is a  member of the party's executive committee, and the Social  Democratic leader in the Norrbotten district.  Footnote    1. Willy Bergstrom is head of the Trade Union  Confederation's  Institute for Economic Research; Mona Sahlin is party secretary  of the Social Democrats; Allan Larsson is a Social Democratic  member of parliament; Par Nuder is the economic researcher in  the Social Democratic Riksdag group.</p>

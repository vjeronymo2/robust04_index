			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Writing in the 20 April Paris daily LE  FIGARO, Jacques Baumel, vice president of the Defense Commission  of the National Assembly, comments that in a world that just  emerged from the Cold War and is already troubled by ethnic and  other conflicts, defense planning is of the utmost importance.  At the same time, defining the new orientations for the national  defense is not an easy task. While the law may not take fully  into account the new threats and the means to confront them, it  does end "years of irresponsibility and hasty decisions" that  weakened the French defense apparatus by gradually abolishing  some 60 regiments and limiting military service to 10 months,  Baumel writes. The new law reestablishes a continuity that will  reassure military officials and industrialists, for it envisions  for the next six years a significant financial outlay of 613  billion francs in an overall context of crisis and downsizing of  state budgets. Planned allocations will allow the continuation  of a number of burdensome programs which are too far advanced to  be stopped, but which will suffer delays. One of them is the  Rafale aircraft, to be delivered at the "ridiculous" rate of one  or two aircraft per year. Another is the Leclerc tank,  production of which is slated to reach no more than 200 units  per year. Carrying out such programs, according to Baumel, will  absorb total allocations and exclude the production of  sophisticated high technology weapons whose efficacy was proven  during the Gulf war, e.g. stealth aircraft, satellites and  antimissile missiles. Baumel contends that nationally-produced  weapons programs are coming to an end and that the time has come  for coproduction agreements, even though they are often  "disappointing, costly and too slow." At the same time, France  must strive to preserve "excellence" in the nuclear and  electronic domains.    The most serious repercussions of the military planning law  will be felt in the vital nuclear field, Baumel continues, since  the law makes no mention of nuclear testing. It thus gives the  future chief of state the responsibility for making a "grave"  decision on whether to continue nuclear testing in a much more  difficult context, since the choice of a "second nuclear  component" has been delayed until 1997. There is also a "serious  gap" between the white book on defense, which presents various  scenarios for intervention abroad, and the real means given  French forces for fire power, air and maritime transports, and  rapid action deployment. Finally, the law does not mention the  capability for precise strikes on military targets with dual-use  weapons, which are more precise and lighter than the heavy  nuclear artillery of missile-launching submarines, in case  missiles are launched from beyond the Mediterranean or the Near  East. While in principle the law takes into account space  activities, real-time information and the mobility of commands,  this "modest undertaking" will not produce concrete  results--save for the Helios system--before the beginning of the  next century. France will thus remain in a "regrettable  situation of dependence" on the United States as far as  large-scale operations are concerned. In fact, all programs  envisioned in the law will be implemented only if the armaments  industry achieves a productivity gain of 2 percent a year, to  compensate for the 0.5 percent increase of allocations in real  terms. This will require a "strenuous restructuring, management  and cooperation effort" entailing the elimination of at least  100,000 jobs, while simultaneously preserving the know-how and  competence of French engineers, Baumel concludes.    In an editorial in the 21 April Paris daily LIBERATION,  Gerard Dupuy bemoans the fact that the "famous peace dividends"  of four years ago have "gone up in smoke" and that military  expenditures are again rising. This contrasts with the policies  followed in comparable countries, as well as with the  restrictions affecting other budget items, Dupuy contends. It  also points up a lack of adaptation of French military doctrine  to the new situation, since the old, nuclear-based policy is  being maintained while another is "discreetly" put in place, he  continues. Inasmuch as it is always costly and never practical  to conduct two policies at the same time, the public will soon  perceive the irony of announcing a rise in military expenditures  just when the Gorazde issue reveals the powerlessness of  European arms in general and French in particular. Only a  success in the Bosnian peacemaking effort could have convinced a  "reticent" public opinion of the utility of military  expenditures. The French, Dupuy concludes, "will have the  impression they are paying a high price without really knowing  why."</p>

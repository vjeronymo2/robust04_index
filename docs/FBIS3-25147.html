			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by Prime Minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keita </F> in Bamako; date not given; read by Bakary Koniba Traore,  minister of equipment and transportation and government  spokesman--recorded]    [Text] In view of the current political and social  situation and the many disturbances that have affected our  capital for some time now, I feel the need to make certain  clarifications in my capacity as head of government. More than  ever before, I would like to reaffirm my unflinching  determination, as well as the determination of the government  that I have the honor to head, to primarily resort to dialogue  with all our partners in order to find solutions to the problems  of our nation. We have taken cognizance of the defection of a  few cabinet members at this time of a serious crisis that is  affecting our country and the entire West African subregion. We  believe that all democrats and patriots--all true sons of  Mali--wherever they may be, will understand the need to join  hands in our efforts to overcome the current predicaments and to  avert threats against the democratic process and the very future  of our nation.    For a few days, disturbances have been taking place in  schools with the attendant threat to the freedom of citizens and  to their property. I would like to appeal to all partners in  the Malian educational sector -- school administrators,  teachers, parents, and students -- to primarily resort to  peaceful negotiations as the only way to safeguard this school  year. I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to all  sincere democrats and patriots to get involved in efforts to  stop all adventurers who would like to plunge our country into  anarchy.    We reiterate our unflinching determination to enforce the  laws of the land, to protect citizens and their property, and to  maintain law and order. Any instigation to revolt through false  rumors or defamatory statements designed to incite hatred among  Malians, at a time when our country rather needs to heal its  wounds and restore national reconciliation, will be punished in  accordance with the law. No great and lasting development can  be achieved in disorder and insecurity. Our country has enough  human and natural resources to overcome this crisis on condition  that we all set to work in discipline.</p>

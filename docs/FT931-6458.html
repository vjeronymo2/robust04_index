			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / German with plan for EC glasnost LIKE Theodore Roosevelt, the reformist US president at the turn of the 20th century, Mr Dieter Wolf speaks softly but carries a big stick. After six months in office, Mr Wolf, the new president of the Federal Cartel Office, Germany's anti-trust authority, has started to spell out his views on the future of EC competition policy. His thoughts may disappoint those in Brussels who saw the 1990s as a decade of expansion of EC powers at the expense of member states. Speaking in his office in Berlin, Mr Wolf makes clear that Germany's attitude to EC competition policy mirrors the Bonn government's views on the evolution of the EC as a whole. There is, he argues, a need for more openness in decision-making, more accountability and, in some cases, more devolution of power to member states. The European Commission is nearing the end of a wide-ranging review of its September 1990 merger rules. Already Germany, along with the UK and France, have indicated that they will resist moves to lower the turnover thresholds above which the EC's competition watchdogs automatically investigate deals affecting the EC market. EC officials said yesterday the Commission remained 'neutral', but Mr Wolf says lowering the current threshold of Ecu5bn (Pounds 4.13bn) is premature. He is pushing for other reforms, mainly clarity on how and why decisions in Brussels are made, noting that the Commission is not obliged to set out in writing the reasons for competition decisions. True, the Commission does produce a short summary, but in nowhere near the detail of the UK's Monopolies and Mergers Commission. He says: 'Inevitably there is some political colouring because of the need to have a majority in the Commission. Inevitably, there is the suspicion of a fix.' Because Germany's competition credentials are stronger than most in the EC, Mr Wolf jokes about a two- or three-speed Europe, with Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands and the UK in the fast lane. Thus, it is also premature to talk up the prospects of a new EC-wide competition authority independent of the Commission: 'It won't probably happen before the end of the century.' Harmonising the varying competition laws among member states could take even longer, even if this means a delay in a true single market. Instead, Mr Wolf would like greater clarity in procedures for vetting cartels and abuse of a dominant market position, under Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome. At present, he estimates some 200 cases are outstanding in Brussels, and the number is expected to rise because of the single market.</p>

			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Business and the Law: Ruling on time limits clarified - European Court European Community law does not preclude the application of a national rule which limits the period for which invalidity benefit may be payable under an EC directive, even where the directive has not been properly implemented, the European Court of Justice ruled recently. In 1970 Mrs Elsie Johnson gave up work to look after her daughter. In 1980, she tried to go back to work but was unable to do so because of a back complaint, for which she was granted non-contributory invalidity benefit. In 1982, she started living with a man and benefit was stopped because, under English law at the time, a woman cohabiting with a man had to show not only that she was unfit for work but also that she was unfit to carry out normal household duties. That criterion did not apply to males. In 1984, non-contributory invalidity benefit was replaced by a severe disablement allowance which could be granted to persons of either sex under identical conditions. The allowance could be claimed automatically by persons entitled to the old benefit without having to satisfy the new allowance conditions. Mrs Johnson was refused automatic entitlement. This refusal was based on domestic legislation, whose effect was to deny an applicant the allowance if payment of the non-contributory invalidity benefit had not been claimed before its abolition. The Social Security Commissioners referred the matter to the European Court of Justice to determine whether such a rule was compatible with the relevant EC directive. The Court held that it had been possible to rely on the provisions of the directive following its implementation in 1984 in order to set aside national rules on the entitlement to benefits which discriminated against women. The provisions also entitled women disadvantaged by maintenance of the discrimination to be treated in the same manner as men in the same situation. Following this ruling, the Social Security Commissioners granted Mrs Johnson the severe disablement allowance, but only with effect from August 1986, 12 months prior to her claim. This restriction on her rights to the allowance was made under domestic legislation. Mrs Johnson appealed to the Court of Appeal. Her argument centred on the ECJ's decision in the Emmott case. In Emmott the ECJ ruled EC law precluded the competent authorities of a member state from relying on national procedural rules imposing time-limits on legal actions in proceedings brought by an individual to protect directly effective rights conferred by a directive where that directive had not been properly implemented by the member state. The Appeal Court sought a preliminary ruling from the ECJ on the scope of the Emmott judgment in relation to Mrs Johnson's case. It wanted to know whether the domestic rule restricting the right to the allowance to a fixed period prior to the date of a claim was compatible with EC law. Although the ECJ found the directive had not been implemented correctly and the domestic rule was a national procedural rule on time-limits, it ruled its finding in Emmott should not apply. The Court said its decision in Emmott had been justified by the circumstances of that case, in which a time-bar had the result of depriving the applicant of any opportunity to rely on equal treatment rights under the directive. In contrast, the domestic rule in the present case merely limited to one year the retroactive effect of claims for invalidity benefits. The Court had already ruled that the rights of women to claim such benefits had to be exercised under the conditions imposed by domestic law provided they were no less favourable than those relating to domestic actions and provided they were not framed so as to render it virtually impossible for individuals to exercise their EC rights. In the present case, those criteria were fulfilled. The Court ruled, therefore, that the domestic legislation in question was compatible with EC law.

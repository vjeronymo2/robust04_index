			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Granny returns - Guaranteed Income Bonds / The Budget and You The 'Granny Bond' is set to return in the form of a new fixed interest National Savings vehicle aimed at those over 65. The National Savings Pensioners Guaranteed Income Bond will pay a fixed monthly income, guaranteed for five years. It will only be available to those aged 65 and over. Interest will be paid gross. The bond will be launched in the new year and full details will be available nearer the time. National Savings says pensioners will be offered 'a decent, fixed rate of return that is within the structure of National Savings and market interest rates prevailing at the time of launch.' It will be interesting to see exactly how competitive the government intends to be. In 1992, the launch of the fixed rate First Option Bond attracted so much money from savers that building societies howled in protest. National Savings promptly dropped the rates paid on the bond. Lower interest rates mean that building societies are having even greater difficulty attracting savings than in 1992. But the government needs a solid contribution from National Savings to help finance its deficit. One must also question whether the new bond will be quite the boon that Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has implied. As Clarke said, interest rates are lower than they have been for a generation; locking away your money at current rates for five years may not be a sensible option. The original Granny Bonds were index-linked National Savings certificates, which increased in value in line with inflation (these are still, of course, on sale but are available to investors of any age).</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Problem plants cut Hazlewood down to Pounds 48m Hazlewood Foods raised its dividend by 5 per cent despite losses at four problem plants which were behind a fall from Pounds 55m to Pounds 48.1m pre-tax for the year to end March. Mr Chris Ball resigned as chief executive of UK operations as Mr Peter Barr, chairman, warned that the situation at the problem plants had deteriorated in the opening months of this year. The latest profit was struck after Pounds 3m of exceptional costs relating to the disposal of two snack and confectionery businesses. Underlying earnings per share fell from 17.51p to 16p. A final dividend of 4.3p is proposed, taking the total for the year to 6.7p (6.4p). The group's business is split two thirds in the UK and one third in the Netherlands. It has been refocusing its activities on added value prepared food products, where it sees good long term growth prospects. The grocery and non foods division reported operating profits of Pounds 15.4m on sales of Pounds 156m, down from Pounds 15.8m on sales of Pounds 170m previously. The fall in turnover reflected disposals which formerly contributed Pounds 25m of sales. Mr John Simons, finance director, said the grocery side of the business had improved operating profits from Pounds 11.4m to Pounds 12.9m, helped by the new Selby bottling plant for pickles and sauces. The non food side, had retreated from Pounds 4.4m to Pounds 2.5m. In the frozen division, which includes fish, shellfish and ready meals, operating profits fell from Pounds 27.1m to Pounds 24.6m. The fish side was hit by both the higher cost of Dutch flatfish and exchange losses. The fresh foods business, which includes three of the four lossmaking plants, reported operating profits down from Pounds 22m to Pounds 19.7m. COMMENT While Chris Ball has fallen on his sword, the UK strategy must have been endorsed by the board. They are likely to find it hard to boost the group's declining margins. Hazlewood now finds itself with a lot of expensive assets which are not generating cash. There are no signs that the markets it is aiming for will get any easier. While the fall in the share price could leave it vulnerable to a predator, it is by no means clear that a new owner could do better. The group's recent history has been disappointing. In 1989, when it made Pounds 46.5m on sales of Pounds 454m, the dividend was more than four times covered - this time it is just over twice covered. Pencilled in profits of Pounds 45m look like leaving little room for any further increase.</p>

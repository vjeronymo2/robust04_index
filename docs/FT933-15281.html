			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Letter: Portrayal of Einstein's teacher unfair Sir, Michael Dixon's example of a recruiter's nightmare (Jobs Column, July 7) - Heinrich Weber's rejection of Einstein - is rather unfair. I suspect that, in Weber's shoes, most of us would have done the same. From my research on a forthcoming biography of Einstein, I can say that Weber's apparent folly is another example of the mythology that has obscured the real story of the century's greatest scientist. The reasons that Einstein became the only one of the four 1900 graduates from Section VIA of the Swiss Federal Polytechnical School (now called the ETH) not to secure an academic position are: Einstein's cocky manners and his irregular attendance at classes had not endeared him to the polytechnic staff. Weber, Einstein's physics lecturer, had told him that his cleverness was marred by one great fault: 'You'll never let yourself be told anything.' Einstein retaliated by addressing him as 'Herr Weber', instead of the formal 'Herr professor'. The average grade of Einstein's final examinations for the teaching diploma was 4.91. This was undistinguished, given that the marks of the others who passed the exams ranged from 5.14 to 5.45. Weber, an experimentalist, took on two mechanical engineers that year; Einstein was a theoretician (much rarer at that time, and in less demand). Michael Dixon can be forgiven for portraying Weber as the villain: Einstein himself suspected that Weber had spread bad opinions of him. He grumbled that he would have found a job 'had it not been for Weber's underhandedness'. Roger Highfield, science editor, The Daily Telegraph, 1 Canada Square, Canary Wharf, London E14</p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSTER DOUGLAS FILES FOR DIVORCE  </P> <P> Heavyweight champion Buster Douglas has filed for divorce, his wife's attorney  said Friday.  </P> <P> Robin Stith, attorney for Bertha Douglas, said Douglas alleges gross neglect of  duty and incompatibility.  </P> <P> Neither Douglas nor his manager, John Johnson, could be reached for comment.  Johnson's son and executive assistant, John Johnson II, said the Douglas camp  would not comment.  </P> <P> Stith said Douglas filed for divorce Wednesday. She said Bertha Douglas will  contest it.  </P> <P> "Mrs. Douglas and I have not yet figured out what our strategy will be," Stith  said. "But we're going to protect her interests, that's for sure. My client  doesn't want a divorce."  </P> <P> Stith said Bertha Douglas did not expect the filing.  </P> <P> The Douglases have been married since 1986. They separated in September, but  Stith said they have been back together "for a few months." She said she did  not know exactly how long.  </P> <P> Douglas won the heavyweight title in February by knocking out Mike Tyson.  </P></p>

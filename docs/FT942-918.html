			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Europe's Greek farce The European Union's weekend summit on Corfu was a fiasco from which none of the main protagonists emerges with much credit. Not only did the leaders fail in their main task of deciding on a successor to Mr Jacques Delors as European Commission president; they ended up in a slanging match of a vehemence and pettiness to match the worst Euro-rows of the mid-1980s. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand must bear some of the blame, for attempting to bulldoze through their own candidate for the Commission post without proper prior consultation. Those countries which had misgivings about the way France and Germany handled the process should, in fairness to Mr John Major, now make their position clear and insist on a more genuinely consultative approach. Even so, Mr Major emerges as a sorry figure. By vetoing a candidate agreed by all other 11 member states, he has once again cast himself as the spoiler of European politics. Given that he has vowed not to back down and that the Union cannot depart from its unanimity rule for this appointment, he will almost certainly succeed in blocking Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's prime minister. But the price, in terms of a further reduction in Britain's influence and credibility in the EU, will be high. The real mystery is why Mr Major chose to behave this way. In the weeks before Corfu, it seemed that Britain would accept Mr Dehaene as a last resort. Mr Major's main purported objection to Mr Dehaene - a claim that he 'represents a tradition of big government and intervention' - seems implausible. The Belgian was put forward, not because he has strong ideological views, but for his reputation as a deal-maker. Mr Major's other argument - that he wanted to demonstrate disapproval, widely shared by other member states, for the way in which the decision was being handled - strikes a slightly more resonant chord. But exercising a veto when all others have reached a consensus can scarcely be the most effective way to influence the subsequent process. Unfortunately, one is forced to conclude that the veto was no more than an improvised and futile gesture to Tory Eurosceptics - futile since no Commission candidate who would command a consensus on the continent is likely to attract their support, and the party's civil war over Europe can now only deepen. It falls to Mr Kohl, who takes over the EU presidency this Friday, to pick up the pieces. He has called an emergency summit on July 15, and it seems likely that one or more compromise candidates will be considered. That would be desirable, if only because as Mr Dehaene himself recognises, to press on would be to risk turning a petty personal squabble into a crisis. Then, once the process is concluded, EU leaders need to show that they have learned the lessons of Corfu by resolving never again to select a Commission president in such a way.</p>

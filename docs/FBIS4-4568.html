			<p>BFN     [Text] Ten Japanese semiconductor manufacturers --  including NEC, Toshiba, and Hitachi -- will jointly establish  "Semiconductor Industries Research Institute," a think tank for  researching and advocating policies to rehabilitate the  competitive power of Japanese semiconductor industries. The  think tank will analyze such subjects as market development for  next-generation technology, and increases in investment costs,  and advocate governmental support and cooperation with academic  circles. Japanese semiconductor industries have been refraining  from such joint projects. This was because the Japan-U.S.  friction over semiconductor trade once focused on the Japanese  Government's excessive support for the industrial circles.  However, major chip makers have decided to jointly solve their  common problems to cope with revival of U.S. makers and rapid  growth of ROK makers. Japanese chip makers intend to stop any  further decline of their world market share.    In addition to NEC, Toshiba, and Hitachi, the think tank  will  be participated in by Fujitsu, Mitsubishi Electric, Oki Electric  Industry, Sony, Matsushita Electronics, Sanyo, and Sharp. NEC  Managing Director Hajime Sasaki is expected to chair the  10-party organization, and its operations will be started by  about five full-time staff supported by member companies.    The primary duty of the think tank is to prepare advisory  reports on the following subjects: 1) development of markets  for next-generation technology, such as multimedia; 2)  technological and industrial problems, such as increasing  investment costs; and 3) the desirable position of the Japanese  semiconductor industry in the world market.    Semiconductor manufacturers have been refraining from  multiparty projects since the 1980's, when "Super LSI  [large-scale integration] Technology Research Cooperative,"  founded in 1976, was criticized by the United States as a cause  of trade friction. However, "individual companies cannot  adequately deal with their problems since cooperation among  material makers, machine tool makers, academic circles, and the  government is not needed in many fields" (as noted by a top  official of a leading chip maker). Therefore, they have decided  to tie up in order to jointly cope with difficult problems.</p>

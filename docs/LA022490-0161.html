			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> S&amp;L BAILOUT LAWS SADDLE DOWNEY WITH $9.4-MILLION LOSS;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: THE SECOND STRAIGHT RED-INK QUARTER IS A DIRECT RESULT OF CAPITAL  RESERVE REGULATIONS, WHICH FORCED THE STILL-SOUND S&amp;L TO SET ASIDE $20.7  MILLION. IT POSTED A $13.6-MILLION PROFIT FOR THE YEAR.  </P> <P> Downey Savings &amp; Loan Assn., scrambling to comply with the tough strictures  of the new thrift industry bailout law, on Friday reported a $9.4-million  fourth-quarter loss.  </P> <P> Industry analysts and Downey officials, however, said that the loss should be a  one-time thing, forced on Downey by new accounting rules and capital  requirements. The 33-year-old thrift continues to be financially sound, they  said.  </P> <P> Downey in fact posted a full-year profit of $13.6 million despite the sizeable  fourth-quarter loss and a $3.7-million loss in the third quarter. The thrift,  which has 49 offices in the state, ended the year with $41 billion in assets  and a capital base of $219.4 million.  </P> <P> That makes it one of only a few hundred thrifts nationwide that meets or  exceeds the three tough new capital reserve requirements established by  Congress, industry officials said. In all, there are about 2,800 thrifts in the  United States.  </P> <P> Downey's third- and fourth-quarter losses were direct results of new federal  regulations requiring S&amp;Ls to carry investment properties and securities on  their books at or below initial purchase price.  </P> <P> Under the rules, a thrift cannot show an increase in the market value of an  investment property but must lower the value or set aside a reserve equal to  the drop in value if the market value falls below the purchase price.  </P> <P> The rules also require S&amp;Ls to set aside reserves to cover a joint venture  partner's potential losses as well.  </P> <P> In Downey's case, a $20.7-million reserve was established for the fourth  quarter to comply with the new rules. That reserve ate up what otherwise would  have been an $11-million operating profit for the three-month period.  </P> <P> But the thrift, which has announced plans to divest itself of its $590-million  portfolio of shopping centers and other real estate holdings to meet the  capital requirements in the next five years, is likely to make up for the  losses with profits from the sale of properties, analysts said.  </P> <P> And Downey's fourth-quarter loss was in keeping with what analysts had  predicted, so the thrifts's stock -- which is traded on the New York Stock  Exchange -- did not lose much value after Friday's announcement.  </P> <P> Downey common stock closed at $16.88 Friday, down 12 1/2 cents a share in  moderately heavy trading.  </P> <P> "The loss for the quarter was less than I thought it would be," said Michael  Abrahams, a thrift industry analyst with the regional brokerage firm of Bateman  Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "The regulators are being pretty rough these days, with the seizure of 11  thrifts" Friday, including Mercury S&amp;L in Huntington Beach and Imperial  Savings in San Diego, Abrahams said.  </P> <P> "What we saw with Downey was similar to what happened to some of those others,  with the regulators forcing Downey to set up perhaps unnecessarily large  reserves," he said.  </P> <P> "The regulators are trying to show how tough they are," said Abrahams, "but  Downey is one of the best capitalized thrifts around and is well known as one  of the classiest acts in the business."  </P> <P> He said there is no sign that Downey is in trouble or will have to take another  significant write-down of the value of its investments.  </P> <P> Campbell Chaney, an analyst with Sutro &amp; Co. in San Francisco, said Downey  should do well this year because it won't have to pay federal income taxes on  the first $95 million it earns.  </P> <P> That's because the thrift has $95 million in operating losses from failed  Butterfield Savings in Santa Ana, which it recently acquired, that Downey can  use to offset an equal amount of profit.  </P> <P> Gerald H. McQuarrie, Downey's chief executive and co-founder, said Friday that  the thrift must use up the entire $95 million this year or lose it and plans to  accelerate the sale of its shopping centers and other investment properties to  do so.  </P> <P> "We have five years to sell all of our real estate," he said, "but we will sell  the biggest part of it this year."  </P> <P> PROFIT AT DOWNEY S &amp; L  </P> <P> In millions of dollars  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.56IN:1.67IN:1.67IN:1.56IN:1.56IN:1.67IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="6"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL SPN="4" CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Quarter  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Year  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1st  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 2nd  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 3rd  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 4th  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Total  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $11.5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $12.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $5.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $3.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $33.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 12.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 28.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 21.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -3.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -9.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 13.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: Downey S&amp;L  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> DANGEROUS NITRATE LEVELS FOUND IN DRINKING-WATER WELLS  </P> <P> Drinking water consumed by about 10,000 residents of El Rio and Nyeland Acres  contains as much as three times the acceptable levels of nitrates, county  officials said Monday.  </P> <P> Ventura County Supervisor Susan K. Lacey described the situation in the areas  north of Oxnard as a health-threatening emergency. She said she will ask the  Board of Supervisors today to provide $25,000 to finance a study of how the  problem can be solved.  </P> <P> Tests conducted last month in wells serving the area showed nitrate levels as  high as 123 parts per million, according to Robert Gallagher, manager of the  resources section of the County Environmental Health Department.  </P> <P> Gallagher said 45 p.p.m. is the maximum acceptable contaminant level set by the  state Department of Health Services. "I would recommend that anyone living in  that area should consult their doctor before using the water," Gallagher added.  </P> <P> Excessive nitrates has "definitely been established" as being harmful to  infants 6 months and younger because it reduces their blood's ability to carry  oxygen, Gallagher said. He said there is no conclusive evidence of a danger to  older children or adults, but that some researchers suspect a link between high  levels of the substance and cancer and birth defects.  </P> <P> "To my knowledge, however, nobody has shown that cancer or birth defects are  caused by excessive nitrate levels," he said. "There is some suspicion that  they're loosely related.".  </P> <P> Lacey noted that some studies also indicate that fetuses and children up to 2  years old may be harmed by nitrite, which is formed in the human body by  excessive nitrate levels.  </P> <P> Lacey hosted a meeting last week attended by state and county water and health  officials along with representatives of a newly formed council of mutual water  companies supplying well water to El Rio and Nyeland Acres. Water from eight of  the companies' wells is suspected of containing excessive nitrates.  </P> <P> Aides to Lacey and Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria), whose district  includes the affected area, met with state water and health officials in  Sacramento on Monday in an attempt to gain state support for an effort to  remove the danger.  </P> <P> Cheryl Collart, an administrative aide to Lacey, said one solution being  considered is merging the small water companies so they can better afford to  purify their water.  </P> <P> Gallagher said excessive nitrates, compounds of nitric acid, have been found in  El Rio and Nyeland Acres water since at least the mid-1970s. Possible sources  of the problem include fertilizer used by farmers, septic tanks and manure from  a dairy that formerly was located there.  </P> <P> Lacey said the impurities may date back to the 1950s. "They seem to come and  go, in peaks and valleys," she said. "Whatever the cause, we're mainly  interested in solving the problem, not blaming anybody."  </P> <P> Fred Gientke, general manager of the United Water Conservation District, whose  water is not among that reported to have excessive nitrate levels, said his  district would be willing to provide water to the affected area temporarily  while a permanent solution is being worked out.  </P> <P> United, which serves parts of Oxnard and Port Hueneme, recently started  supplying water to Rio del Valle Junior High School in El Rio after school  officials expressed fear that the health of students might be adversely  affected by the high nitrate levels, Gientke said.  </P></p>

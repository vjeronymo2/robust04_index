			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: A COUPLE OF JABS SETTLE THE QUESTION  </P> <P> Promoter Bob Arum, amused by the talk of a Tony Mandarich-Mike Tyson showdown,  told the Pittsburgh Press that Jim Brown once thought he was ready to challenge  for the heavyweight title.  </P> <P> Arum said that he and Brown, a good friend, were in London for the Muhammad  Ali-Henry Cooper fight when Brown mentioned that he wanted to take on Ali.  </P> <P> The message was relayed to Ali.  </P> <P> Arum: "Ali asked us to meet him in Hyde Park, and when we did, he stuck out his  chin and told Jimmy to hit him with everything he had. Jimmy reared back and  Ali started slapping him, bap-bap-bap, using his open hand. Jimmy never saw any  of it.  </P> <P> "That was the end of that."  </P> <P> What, me worry?: From the Sporting News: New England Patriots tight end Russ  Francis was arrested July 2 in Incline Village, Nev., after allegedly driving  his motorcycle 58 m.p.h. in a 45-m.p.h. zone. Francis was charged with drunk  driving, failure to wear a helmet, driving an unregistered vehicle, failure to  have proof of insurance, driving with an expired license and carrying a  handgun.  </P> <P> Said Patriot Coach Raymond Berry: "He told me not to worry about it and that it  was no big deal at all."  </P> <P> Add Sporting News: Dave Nightingale, on the second-round loss of Gabriela  Sabatini at Wimbledon: "The London tabloids blamed the loss on the presence of  Gaby's scorned Italian boyfriend, who appeared, uninvited, at her London hotel,  where he plaintively pleaded his case, to no avail."  </P> <P> Trivia time: On Thursday night's Dodger-Cardinal telecast, what did ABC analyst  Joe Morgan mean when he said that Alfredo Griffin was batting below the Mendoza  Line last year?  </P> <P> Air Walsh: Bill Walsh, coach turned broadcaster, explained once why he favored  a passing offense: "Our turnovers are downfield, theirs are at the line of  scrimmage."  </P> <P> Add Walsh: He said the reason he joined NBC was that he needed a new challenge.  According to wire reports, the money isn't bad either. He reportedly signed for  $750,000 a year, about twice his salary as a San Francisco 49ers vice  president.  </P> <P> Big cat?: From Baltimore Orioles scout Ed Farmer, marveling at the strength of  165-pound Junior Felix, rookie outfielder for the Toronto Blue Jays: "If he's  Junior Felix, I'd love to see Senior Felix."  </P> <P> A joiner: Said Pittsburgh Pirates outfielder Benny Distefano, when asked the  craziest thing he ever did: "Taking part in a student protest against the  government while playing winter ball in Venezuela. I didn't even know what I  was protesting against."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Mario Mendoza, an infielder who broke in with Pittsburgh in  1974, had a nine-year hitting average of .215. In the Sunday averages,  ballplayers would look for his name and check the figures in his line. Nobody  wanted to be below the line.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Chi Chi Rodriguez, senior golfer, on diet: "Billy Casper eats all  this weird stuff. I eat steak every day. They say red meat is bad for you, but  I never saw a sick-looking tiger."  </P></p>

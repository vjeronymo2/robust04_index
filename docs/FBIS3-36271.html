He himself assessed the event as "just and  logical." [passage omitted]    There are currently three most painful questions before the  "frozen" court. The first is about the time for being "thawed."  This will probably not happen until two months from now, when a  new law on the Constitutional Court has been passed (the text is  ready and awaits its turn in the Duma). Second is the question  of its chairman. Few people see in this post the current acting  chairman, Nikolay Vitruk, who has lately proven himself a  conformist. Valeriy Zorkin no longer aspires to fill the vacant  chair. But it is hard to imagine an outsider [varyag] becoming  chairman, although in the wings Andrey Makarov and Mikhail  Fedotov are still being named. The president's obvious  supporters -- Nikolay Vitruk, Tamara Morshchakova, and Ernest  Ametistov are so far in the minority. The third question is  about by-elections. Under the new constitution, the number of  judges should be increased to 19. All the "newcomers" should be  nominated by the president and confirmed by the State Duma.    Valeriy Zorkin believes that the Constitutional Court still  has a chance to "contribute to the restoration of a normal  constitutional system." Talking with your MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI  correspondent, Zorkin spoke for a "strong, capable authority."  Asked if he implied a strong presidential authority, he  replied: "Of course. Whatever they may say, I am a resolute  advocate of a very strong presidential authority. With one  reservation: in the existence of a strong parliament."    Valeriy Zorkin believes that the Court would be able to  cooperate with the new legislative branch. As for the executive  branch, "this is a delicate question, and I would prefer to  skirt it." The ex-chairman now generally prefers to duck  "purely political" questions: "This is no time today for  showdowns. On the contrary, common grounds should be sought."    Information has leaked into the press of late that a "broad  coalition of opposition non-radical forces" is being created and  that Zorkin would probably come to lead this movement. He is  not ready to confirm such reports: "When I read them, I was  amazed. I am a judge so far, and I stay aloof from politics."</p>

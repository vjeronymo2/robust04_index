			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the Mexican Zapatist National </F> Liberation Army's, EZLN, Clandestine Indian Revolutionary  Committee-General Command, CCRI-CG, in Chiapas on 3 June]    [Text] To the people of Mexico, the people and governments  of the world, and brothers:    The EZLN's CCRI-CG addresses you to declare the following:    1) We have learned that persons who are active in the  so-called organization Revolutionary Workers Clandestine  People's Union party (PROCUP) have gone to someplace in the  Americas to declare that PROCUP has ties with the EZLN and that  the EZLN is PROCUP's "armed wing." These persons have been  collecting funds, claiming that "they are for the EZLN."    2) The EZLN declares it has no relationship or any tie to  PROCUP. The EZLN never has had any contact with PROCUP, it is  not part of its structure, nor does it have anything to do with  it. The economic contributions received by PROCUP are not in any  way for the EZLN.    3) In several Chiapas municipalities, activists of the  so-called Labor Party [PT] attempt to convince the peasants to  vote for the PT in the coming August elections, arguing that it  has contacts with the EZLN and that "there is an agreement with  subcommander Marcos," to support the PL in August.    4) The EZLN declares that subcommander Marcos and members of  the CCRI-CO have no relations nor any pact with the so-called  PL, nor have they ever met with PL leaders.    5) We urge the different organizations not to make use of  the EZLN's name to benefit their interests and not to lie with  regard to their alleged relations, which they know that they do  not have with us.    6) We call on the Mexican people and the peoples of the  world not to be deceived. When the EZLN makes contacts or  agreements with any organization, it makes this known in a  public communique, as it has done with the CEOIC [State Council  of Indian and Peasant Organizations] and with the CONAC-LN  [expansion unknown].    Democracy! Freedom! Justice!    Respectfully, the CCRI-CG. General headquarters, southeast  Mexican mountains, Chiapas, Mexico, June 1994.</p>

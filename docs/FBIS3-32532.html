			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Mexican Foreign Relations Secretariat today  rejected the new U.S. Government policy of stopping illegal  immigration at its southern border.    The Mexican Government warns police-type measures are not  appropriate to deal with a socioeconomic phenomenon such as the  flow of immigration. Mexico expresses regret that these types  of actions are being taken, because they deteriorate relations  between the border areas and create a negative atmosphere  between Mexico and the United States.    We are concerned by the fact these types of measures are  being taken as trade is reaching unprecedented levels and tends  to rapidly increase following the implementation of the North  American Free Trade Agreement. Mexico cannot accept the  argument that Mexican migrant workers are to blame for the  creation of economic and social problems, which are not their  fault, especially because these type of remarks are made to  satisfy certain short-term electoral objectives.    The Mexican Foreign Relations secretariat will be alert to  any abuse or discriminations that may emerge once these U.S.  Government measures are adopted against Mexican illegal aliens,  the communique states.</p>

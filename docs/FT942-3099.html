In the match starting today at Lord's we want to win, but against more impressive opposition. Ball by ball coverage runs from 11.00 am to 7.00 pm on Radio 4 long wave. BBC1 begins television coverage at 10.55 am and there are highlights on BBC1 at 12.50 tonight. The journalist's ultimate dream assignment comes to an end with the screening on BBC2 of the fourth in the series Wooldridge On Whisky (8.00). That is followed by the last in the sequence of Lost Steptoes, the recordings from the famous 1970s comedy, found in a cellar, which have proved that, whatever the technical quality, the comedy writing sticks out a mile (8.30). BBC1 begins a drama series which is not about policemen or any aspect of crime, in itself a cause for celebration. Roughnecks is about the people who work on oil rigs (9.30).</p>

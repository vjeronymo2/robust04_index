Kresimir Cosic, minister plenipotentiary at the Croatian  Embassy in the United States, delivered President Tudjman's  letter to Mr. Kent Schiner on 14 February at the Croatian  Embassy. The letter reads as follows:    Dear Mr. Schiner,    In the early 1980's, I wrote an extensive dissertation on  the  history of evil and violence entitled The Enormity of  Historical Reality. At the time, I could not publish my  work, for I was a political prisoner and I criticized the  authorities. Only when former Yugoslavia started to  disintegrate, when the communist society fell apart, when new  democracies were founded and republics gained independence --  only then could I publish that work, this time as the president  of the first internationally recognized Republic of Croatia.    Since it was first published in 1989, The Enormity of  Historical Reality triggered strong and, unfortunately,  negative reactions by some members of the international Jewish  community. I was deeply hurt by those reactions and they made  me reexamine my statements and reevaluate parts of the book in  which I quoted documents and personal views of some writers or  of people who participated in those events.    Since The Enormity of Historical Reality was  published, about four years ago, I had the opportunity or,  better yet, I have been trying to get to know, as thoroughly as  possible, and become involved in the Croatian and international  Jewish community, in order to gain an insight into its needs,  culture, and history, its hopes and fears. That lasting contact  broadened my horizons and I now know much more than I did years  ago when I was writing the book as a persecuted dissident. I  greatly admire the Jewish people, their strength and fight for  independence and freedom, which equals that of the Croatian  people. Especially regarding our developing relations and my  increasingly better understanding of the Jewish people, I  appreciate the harm that certain parts of the book could cause  and the misunderstanding it could cause. I would, therefore,  like to offer my apology, both as the president of the new,  independent state that wants to develop a solid and lasting  friendship with the Jewish people, but also as a man who wants  to contribute to that by means of this apology. Consequently, I  have decided to delete those controversial parts from my book,  which is soon to be published in English. This particularly  refers to wording that I now consider inappropriate, whether  because it indicates a lack of sensibility, because it is based  on sources that were later proved unreliable, or because their  overall impression arouses prejudice against the Jewish people,  and that has never been my intention. I shall continue to take  into account the needs of the Croatian Jewish community and work  toward a better understanding of the Jewish communities and the  Republic of Croatia, as I have been doing since I was elected  president of the Republic of Croatia.</p>

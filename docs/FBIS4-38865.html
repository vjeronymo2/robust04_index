			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Answer given by A. Yablokov, chairman of the </F> Interdepartmental Commission for Environmental Security at the  Russian Federation Security Council, to a reader's question:  "Will Russia Remain a Nuclear Dump?"]    [Text] Every now and then, newspapers report that nuclear  waste from abroad is being dumped in Russia. Is our country  really going to remain a nuclear dump for the whole world?  (Sergey Gudkov, Podolsk)    [Yablokov] In accordance with agreements signed before 1992,  nuclear waste is brought to Russia from certain European  countries (Finland, Bulgaria), where nuclear electric power  stations built with Soviet participation are in operation. And  although the Russian Law on the Protection of the Natural  Environment bans the bringing in, storage, and burial of nuclear  waste (Article 50), the Ministry of Atomic Energy believes that  this ban does not concern bringing in spent nuclear fuel for  treatment, since the intergovernmental agreements were concluded  before the law was adopted.    There is no such intergovernmental agreement with Hungary.  This one has been concluded at ministry level. Our commission  believes that we are not obliged to take fuel for treatment from  Hungary. We also believe that when it fulfills its commitments  concerning the treatment of spent nuclear fuel, Russia should  return the waste from the treatment to the countries it came  from. That is also the State Duma's position.    An interdepartmental commission is now striving for a review  of the concept of a closed nuclear cycle, which emerged during  the arms race. This was necessary in order to obtain plutonium,  necessary for preparing nuclear weapons, from the treatment of  nuclear fuel. Now there is no such need. And it is sensible to  store waste from nuclear electric power stations over a specific  period in special storage pits and then bury it like normal  radioactive waste, which is what the United States does, rather  than treating it.</p>

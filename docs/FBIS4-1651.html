			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["CD News" item: "State Goes After Fake Invoices, Tax </F> Evasion"]    [Text] The State Taxation Administration has announced a  fresh nationwide crackdown starting today on the increasing  number of forgers, sellers and thieves of invoices, which are  then used to evade or cheat on taxes.    These crimes -- especially the forgery of invoices for  value-  added tax -- are greatly disturbing the country's new tax reform  that began this year, State Council Secretary-General Luo Gan  said on Wednesday.    Co-organized the campaign are also the Public Security  Ministry, the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's  Procuratorate. [sentence as published]    The reform centers on a consumer tax system with the  value-added tax at its core.    Invoices are critical documents for the calculation of the  tax, and any forgery is detrimental to the tax reform package.    Speaking at a national telephone conference announcing the  start of the drive, Luo called on the country's police, taxation  and judicial workers to take severe measures to stop criminal  activities concerning invoices.    Currently, businesses in many large- and medium-sized cities  take advantage of the forged and stolen invoices to evade or  cheat on taxes.    Luo called on the Public Security Ministry, the State  Taxation Administration, the Supreme People's Court and the  Supreme People's Procuratorate to form a special coordination  office to guide the campaign, which will continue through June.    The move will focus on big cities and areas where the crimes  are most prevalent. Other areas and regional governments should  also put the fight on their agenda for their daily work, Luo  said.    Targeting forgery and theft gangs, the drive aims to net  underground printshops that produce large batches of bogus  invoices, as well as those who sell the fraudulent documents.    People who use the fake invoices to evade taxes or cheat on  their tax returns should also be sought out and dealt with  harshly. Luo added.    By the end of June, the campaign must meet its goals to  ensure the smooth implementation of China's new tax measures.    Local protectionism and professional corruption must be  cleared away to carry out this battle.    In addition, it is imperative to educate and encourage  people  to check for and reject fake invoices, he added.</p>

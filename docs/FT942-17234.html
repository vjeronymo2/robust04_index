			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Arts: Lazarev's bold strokes - Music The Barbican has played host to the BBC Symphony and to Alexander Lazarev, their 'principal guest conductor' since 1992 (and Bolshoy director since 1987), twice in the last fortnight. Some of us are just now realising what an excellent choice the BBC has made. The orchestra itself sounds fully persuaded, for it was on strong, distinguished form for both concerts: acutely sensitive to Lazarev's overall intentions, grateful to take expressive advantage of the breathing-space he makes for solo voices. This second Lazarev concert repeated the format exactly; only the actual music was different. Instead of a symphony by an obscure Georgian in late middle-age, he introduced one by an obscure 74-year-old Muscovite; instead of Shostakovich's precocious First, we had his stark, sombre Sixth; and the virtuoso concerto this time was Prokofiev's no. 2 for violin. The proud soloist was Dmitri Sitkovetsky, forceful but perfectly soigne as is his wont. The conductor's big test came at last with Shostakovich's fraught Sixth (1939). But it was scarcely a 'test'. Lazarev established his musical authority in it at once, so one just sat back to appreciate how he would develop it. Severely contrapuntal, mostly dark despite some all-out shrieks, the Sixth is no easy showpiece. Organising its broad paragraphs and the troubled longer argument that contains them is work for a musician rather than a showman. Lazarev set about it with urgent, expert sympathy and unforced purpose, and the result left a deep impression. In a few places Shostakovich's score rises to desperate screams. Each time, Lazarev had made us feel the relentless musical pressures that justify them  -but he rushed nothing, allowing the music to accumulate its own anxious weight. The BBCSO played superbly, from piccolo (much favoured here) and first flute down to the impeccably alert timpanist. The ensemble-writing was as pointed and telling as a good chamber team could boast. Was that due to extra rehearsal time, or a special Lazarev knack? As for Nikolay Karetnikov's Symphony no. 4, Lazarev was (shall we say) nice with it. In 1963 it must have been a brave, defiantly unacceptable Soviet essay in Schoenbergian writing. Now its expressive convolutions sound honest and plain, never unmusical, but sedulously beholden to the Viennese master - too much like an earnest, belated homage to an ideal that had already been taken much further and more fluently by Western sparks. Karetnikov is a long-respected composer of Soviet film music (like Sofia Gubaidulina), with a keen dramatic ear. This performance made me want to hear more of his earlier 'acceptable' music, and his most recent pieces - but I suspect that his transitional work should remain decently hidden away, like anybody else's private crises.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Norway's financial watchdog attacked NORWAY'S financial sector watchdog, the Banking, Insurance, Securities Commission, was ineffective, lacked the resources it needed to operate efficiently and was too weak to alert government authorities to signs the country was on the verge of a banking crisis, according to a government report published yesterday. The report also criticises the banks, the central bank and the statistics bureau, which, it says, could have alerted the government. It points to several main causes behind the collapse of the banking system which resulted last autumn in the state becoming the main owner of Norway's banks. The banks maintained a low interest rate policy for commercial and non-commercial loans which was significantly below their own funding costs, according to the report. Their capital ratios deteriorated markedly, with subordinated loans increasing steadily as their equity bases eroded. They were also severely hit by new rules for loan loss reserves implemented in 1987, a time when the financial sector crisis was already well underway. The rules forced the banks to account for anticipated, but not yet materialised, high loan losses and they were therefore forced to book losses before the losses actually occurred. The crisis was also precipitated by the effects of a sharp downturn in the country's economic cycle, a collapse of the real estate market and deregulation of the banking system. The level of competition between the banks brought too rapid expansion and too lax credit judgement.</p>

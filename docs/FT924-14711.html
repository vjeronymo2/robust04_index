			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: Further restrictions on Citicorp disclosed CITICORP, the leading US bank, yesterday disclosed it could no longer make acquisitions or add to its assets without the approval of federal banking regulators. The bank has seen its share price drop by 5 per cent this week in the wake of reduced profit forecasts and the surprise resignation of its president. The restrictions are part of a memorandum of understanding with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Federal Reserve that the bank was forced to sign last February, but which was revealed only in August. The memorandum provided for closer oversight by regulators, especially of Citicorp's internal operating and capital plans. The bank has been selling assets and cutting costs in order to improve its capital-to-assets ratio. The additional constraint on making acquisitions was disclosed yesterday by Citicorp in a securities filing made in connection with a Dollars 650m offer of preferred stock. Mr John Morris, Citicorp's spokesman, said he did not regard the latest disclosure as 'substantive'. Morgan Stanley, the investment bank leading the preferred stock offer, will today begin making a presentation to investors in New York. Wall Street analysts say the stock offer could be affected by market confusion about the reasons behind the abrupt departure on Monday of Mr Richard Braddock, the Citicorp president, who was a close colleague of Mr John Reed, the bank's chairman. The bank has said that Mr Braddock chose to resign. Citicorp also said in its filing that its third-quarter earnings would be in the range of Dollars 80m to Dollars 100m, or less than half the level previously anticipated by most analysts. The bank said consumer loan write-offs would remain high at about Dollars 870m, while there would also be about Dollars 65m of pre-tax charges related to the bank's restructuring programme. Yesterday, on Wall Street, the bank's share price declined by Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 14 5/8 , having already fallen by Dollars  3/4 on Tuesday.</p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Letter: Nothing heavenly about this Sir, Re Observer's story, 'Tailspin' (December 23), the Japanese translation for 'descent from heaven' is, in fact, 'amakudari', not 'amukadari'. Depending on the characters used, the verb 'amu' can mean 'to edit', while the verb 'daru' means 'to grow tired of'. I think you get my meaning.

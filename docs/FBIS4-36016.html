			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source has categorically denied that  any Arab party is participating in the military operations waged  by the forces of legitimacy against rebellious secessionists.  The source described the reports disseminated by the  secessionist gang that Iraqis are participating in the fighting  as false, fabricated, and misleading allegations. This gang has  repeated such fabrications and lies to mislead public opinion  and gain some Arab and international parties' sympathy, said the  source.    The responsible source added: It is not new to see this gang  repeating such false allegations on the presence of Iraqis or  others. Yesterday, the television, which is controlled by this  gang, showed Sudanese nurse Salah Muhammad Fadlallah and claimed  that he is a pilot fighting at the side of the forces of unity  and legitimacy. This allegation was exposed when the gang  presented the documents of this person who was kidnapped by the  members of this gang from his work site in one of the medical  centers in the Lahij Governorate. This person, who has been  working as a nurse in Yemen for the past five years, was shown  on the television as a pilot.</p>

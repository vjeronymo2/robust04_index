			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Radio 5 opens for business Two of the main business programmes on BBC Radio 4 are to move to the new Radio 5 Live news and sports network due to launch on March 28. The Financial World Tonight and The Financial Week are moving to the new network as part of its expanded financial and business coverage. Ms Jenny Abramsky, controller of the new network, promised yesterday that it would be fun, would take risks and woulkd try to involve listeners by putting them in touch with people in the news and BBC correspondents. Ms Abramsky outlined a draft schedule for the network that will replace Radio 5. The schedule includes a one-hour news round-up at 5am followed by a breakfast programme lasting 2 1/2 hours, a two-hour lunchtime programme and a three-hour drive-time programme that will include coverage from all main regional centres in the UK. The Radio 5 Live controller also promised a look back to see what happened to prominent stories when the headlines are over, and regular personality profiles made by independent producers. Market research suggests that up to 29 per cent of the population would try such a station, a quarter of whom do not listen to any BBC radio stations.</p>

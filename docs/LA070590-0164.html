			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE KIDS: FAMILY NATURE NIGHTS;  </P> <P> IN THE DARK;  </P> <P> EVENING OUTINGS ARE DESIGNED TO PRY YOUNGSTERS AND PARENTS AWAY FROM THE  TELEVISION.  </P> <P> On those long summer evenings the best show in Ventura isn't on television.  It's outside -- under the stars, or maybe under the trees, where owls or other  animals of the night might make an appearance.  </P> <P> The Ventura Department of Parks and Recreation is sponsoring a series of family  nature nights designed to pry youngsters and their parents away from the  television.  </P> <P> The four Thursday outings, all from 7:30 to 9 p.m., are geared for the entire  family and cost $5 per person or $12 for a family of three. Children must be  accompanied by an adult.  </P> <P> The first one, called "plant appeal," is scheduled today at Seaside Wilderness  Park, adjacent to Emma Wood State Beach. The group will meet at Surfer's Point,  and hike and explore along the Ventura River estuary, focusing on native  plants, according to Sharol Nelson-Embry, a city recreation leader.  </P> <P> Participants will learn what's edible -- and what's poisonous, such as poison  oak and hemlock.  </P> <P> They may sample New Zealand spinach that grows wild along the coast.  </P> <P> Another edible plant is sea rocket, which has seed pods that resemble a rocket.  </P> <P> Those in the group will learn how plants adapt to harsh coastal climates and  hear Chumash legends.  </P> <P> On July 12, nature buffs will meet in Arroyo Verde Park off Foothill Road for a  program about raptors, such as owls and hawks. A specialist from the Raptor  Rehabilitation and Release Program in Simi Valley will bring some birds for the  group to see.  </P> <P> He will talk about how the birds hunt and live in the wild, how their feet and  eyes are specially adapted for their way of life. The group also will look for  owls and hawks.  </P> <P> On July 19, the group will meet at Dennison Park in Ojai for an evening of star  gazing. Santa Barbara author Ernest Underhay will talk about astronomy --  stars, meteors and constellations -- and Chumash Indian legends.  </P> <P> The last outing, July 26, will be at Seaside Wilderness Park. Participants will  explore the park, looking for raccoons, skunks and rodents. They will look for  traces of the animals -- tracks, droppings or nibbled plants. They'll also keep  an eye out for dolphins, seals and whales.  </P> <P> * WHERE AND WHEN: Participants may register on the day of the outings or before  at the Ventura Park and Recreation Department, Room 226, City Hall, 501 Poli  St. Or they can register by phone using a credit card. Call 658-4726.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kim Cha-su: "U.S. Trade Pressure and Government </F> Countermeasures"]    [Text] The United States is now stepping up the trade  pressure that had abated temporarily. It appears as though U.S.  trade pressure will be amplified since the Super 301 provision  was revived on 3 March. Accordingly, the government is taking  pains to prepare countermeasures against the U.S. trade pressure.    At present, the United States is interested, most of all, in  opening the auto market wider and hastening the opening of the  services sector. On 7 March, the United States dispatched Peter  Collins, U.S. deputy assistant trade representative in charge of  Asia and Pacific affairs, to the ROK to make a full-scale demand  for the ROK to open its auto market.    The United States believes that the 120 to 1, car imports to  exports ratio is in a state of great imbalance because of tariff  and non-tariff barriers in the ROK, and are strongly demanding  that the ROK adjust this. First complaining of the ROK's 10  percent tariff on passenger cars compared to its 2.5 percent  tariff, the United States said that because the special excise  tax is imposed according to differential tariff rates, the  competitive strength of large U.S. cars is diminished. Tax  probes of buyers of foreign cars, and the inability of U.S. car  makers to secure broadcast advertisement time were cited as  additional barriers to the advance of U.S. cars in the ROK  market.    Apparently, U.S. Deputy Assistant Trade Representative  Collins will also discuss the issue of intellectual property  rights with ROK Government officials. The United States placed  the ROK on its list of countries subject to priority  surveillance. Although the ROK has strengthened the protection  of intellectual property rights over the past several years,  illegal duplication of software programs and trademark  infringements by enterprises have yet to be rooted out. This is  another source of U.S. complaints. In connection with this, the  government will notify the United States of our policy of  strongly cracking down on infringements of intellectual property  rights, and at the same time will ask the United States to  exclude the ROK from its list of countries subject to priority  surveillance.    The government feels that we do not have to unconditionally  meet the U.S. demand for market opening, but that we can cope  according to our own plan. In other words, because our  government has already begun to open up each field according to  its policy of openness, it simply plans to seek the full  understanding of the United States by explaining the situation.  The government will also convey its concern over the revival of  the Super 301 provision to the United States, pointing out that  the provision runs counter to the spirit of forming the World  Trade Organization, which is to be inaugurated next year with  the conclusion of Uruguay Round negotiations.    Government officials explain that trade issues recently  raised by the United States differ in character from those of  the past, and that our government is not being unilaterally  pressured. A Foreign Ministry official said: "That fact that  the United States is still interested in our country in its  demand for further opening of our markets, is a positive sign."  He continued: "A bigger problem is that people in the United  States are now talking of giving up on the ROK market to focus  on Japan and China instead."</p>

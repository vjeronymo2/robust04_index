			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Liquidators of BCCI file lawsuit THE LIQUIDATORS of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International have filed a Dollars 10.5bn civil lawsuit against Sheik Khalid bin Mahfouz, former head of National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia, who was indicted in the US last July on BCCI-related fraud charges. The suit, against both Sheikh Khalid and the bank itself, is is unusual both in its size and because it means an embarrassing legal action is being brought against a leading banker close to the Saudi royal family. Under US racketeering laws, the actual damages to be awarded if the lawsuit succeeds could be trebled to more than Dollars 30bn. Sheikh Khalid has denied all charges. The liquidators allege in the suit - filed in the US, UK, Jersey, Luxembourg and Switzerland - that Sheikh Khalid broke US laws by engaging in racketeering and fraud. The suit seeks to freeze the assets of Sheikh Khalid and the Saudi bank in each country. The US Federal Reserve last summer levied a Dollars 170m penalty against Sheikh Khalid. It also ordered the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia to shut down its New York branch. In Washington, Judge Joyce Green of the district court has issued a temporary order that stops Sheikh Khalid from transferring any of his US assets out of the country. In London, Mr Dennis Norman, acting general manager of National Commercial Bank's UK operations, confirmed the bank had received a restraining order on Sheikh Khalid's UK assets. 'We are very shocked about the action,' he said.</p>

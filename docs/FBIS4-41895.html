			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Bulygin: "Kuban `Illegals'"] </F>   [Text] Krasnodar -- Krasnodar is gradually turning from a  communist bastion into a testing ground where interregional  policy can be tried out. And not by waving a magic wand, but by  implementing Kuban's status as a special zone. It is no  accident that Russians are interested in the processes under way  here, and the local authorities, while divulging their  experience in dribs and drabs, are improving on it and borrowing  innovations from others. Graphic evidence of that is provided  by the recent holding in Krasnodar Kray of a session of the  council of the Association for Socioeconomic Cooperation among  the Republics, Krays, and Oblasts of the North Caucasus, the  conference of heads of organs of state power in the south of  Russia, Abkhazia, and the Crimea, the all-Russia scientific and  practical conference "Local Self-Government and Regional  Economic Practice in the New Political and Economic Situation,"  and the second international "Partnership for Progress"  conference. The interest in discussing purely economic and  managerial problems leaves no time for any political statements,  while the cards-on-the-table attitude displayed in the latest  moves are disarming the opposition in the shape of those who  love political intrigues.    Thus, a signing ceremony and an exchange of texts of  treaties  of friendship and cooperation between the Kuban and the Republic  of Ingushetia has taken place in the presence of journalists.  [Ingushetia President] Ruslan Aushev's comment was that people  still engage in politics even when they are living badly. The  president of Ingushetia shared his faith in the republic's  economic prosperity. But this is something that can only be  dreamed about for the time being. Currently more than half of  the local able-bodied population is unemployed. It was the  search for investment that brought the president to Krasnodar.  And he wanted to check his position against what his neighbors  had achieved so as to make use of their experience in preparing  a document on the creation of an economic development zone [zona  ekonomicheskogo blagopriyatstvovaniya] in the republic.    Russian Federation components are not doing any the worse  for  being harnessed together. A wide range of issues regarding the  general agreement between the Russian Government and the regions  was examined at the Association's council session -- on the  development of the program for a unified transport system for  the North Caucasus, and on economic cooperation and the  provision of epidemiological safety in southern regions. The  Kuban and the Crimea have also agreed to jointly build a bridge  over the Kerch Strait.    The returns on many projects will only be visible in the  future. But it is also important that they have not been  dictated from on high but are being implemented according to the  plans of the new leaders and entourages that have arrived at  local level. These people came up with the initiative to set up  the Association, which is reviving centuries-old interregional  ties and establishing new ones. Any country or region can  become a member of the socioeconomic commonwealth, and actual  membership of the Association does not mean recognizing the  independence of certain regions.    The discussion at the scientific and practical conference of  the problems of distributing functions between the federal and  local authorities, and of ties between the regions and the  center and organs of local self-government was also dictated by  life. Mayor Valeriy Samoylenko of Krasnodar noted in this  connection: "There is a kind of situation in society whereby  policy is still made in the capitals, while the economics is  done -- or not done -- at local level. Organs of local  self-government are now coming in for the greatest pressure from  the population. They have become a kind of lightning rod at a  time of socioeconomic tension"....    The kinds of bolts that are hitting the "lightning rod"  were explained by Ilya Demenko, general director of the kray  administration's Finance, Budget, and Control Department.    "Under the Russian president's edict, the regions themselves  should be concerned about supplying the population with bread.  The Kuban is the country's breadbasket, and you would have  thought that this task could have been resolved here without any  particular bother. But the question arises: Where will the  billions of rubles to buy grain for the agrarian sector come  from, if kray, city, and rayon budgets are all out of kilter?  This has been a stumbling block when it comes to solving other  problems too. Politicians provide payments from federal pockets  on the basis of population sizes, but the central authorities  use as their basis obsolete figures that take no account of  migration processes...."    The governor of the Kuban has signed a decree beefing up the  pre-existing norms for controlling resettlement. People will  now only be able to come here to live on receipt of official  invitations issued by local administrations. Residence permits  continue to be the main mechanism for regulating migration for  the time being. Were they to be abolished, other levers would  be sought. The kray administration has already passed a decree  on the recruitment and utilization of foreign labor in the Kuban  under license. In order to close off channels for illegal  immigration it has been decided to set up a special center from  where illegals will be resettled in other parts of Russia.  These enforced measures have become possible thanks to the  Kuban's being granted special status as a Federation component.  The kray is indeed special. It not only enjoys a favorable  climate, but has become a Russian border region and the  country's southern gateway to the Mediterranean and the Near  East. This means that this is the place where bridges of  economic cooperation should also be built with the states of  Europe and America.</p>

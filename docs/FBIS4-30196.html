			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- The May 18 large-scale  stamp-forging plant of the Chollima steel complex in Korea has  begun operation with its large material and roller processing  facilities reinforced. This has put new muscles into the  processing base.    Officials of the Ministry of Metal Industry and officials  and  workers of machine plants across the country supplied all the  equipment needed by it including seven large roller klathes, ten  horizontal and vertical heat treatment ovens and several  overhead cranes including a 100-ton crane in a short period.    The workers of the large machine tool plant of the Yongsong  Associated Machinery Bureau, the numerical control branch  factory of the June 1 youth general electric appliances works,  the Taean electric appliances plant of the Taean heavy machine  complex and the October 5 general automation works showed a high  level of science and technology of the chuche-based machine  building industry.    The workers of the Chollima steel complex including the May  18 large-scale stamp-forging plant undertook the manufacture of  heat treatment ovens and cranes and assembly of equipment.    The operation of all the newly installed equipment is quite  satisfactory. Now the 10,000-ton press will give fuller play to  its might and the chuche character of the metal industry will be  increased.</p>

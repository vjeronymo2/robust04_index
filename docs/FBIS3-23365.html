			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Spanish Government advises all Spaniards  residing in Algeria whose presence there is not essential to  leave the country. The on-going attacks of foreigners by Islamic  groups are the reason for this warning. The Spanish colony in  Algeria numbers 327. The advice also covers diplomatic  personnel whose protection has been increased over the last  months.    The French authorities have also made a similar appeal to  their community in Algeria. Yesterday's stabbing of a French  businessman and his son in Algiers means that 31 foreigners have  been murdered in Algeria over the last six months.</p>

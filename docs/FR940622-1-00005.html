			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has prepared this proposed regulation to clarify its decommissioning funding requirements for persons licensed under Parts 30, 40, 70, and 72. Although it does alter existing requirements, regulatory analyses developed in support of prior decommissioning regulations remain valid and appropriate for this rulemaking because these analyses assumed that all licensees would submit a certification of financial assurance to the NRC of a rule prescribed amount, or licensee estimated and NRC approved amount, necessary to provide adequate funds to decommission the licensed facility and that licensees would have complied with the decommissioning funding requirements prior to ceasing operations and commencing decommissioning. These prior analyses, developed for the rules on expiration and termination licenses and financial assurances for decommissioning, remain available for inspection in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. This discussion constitutes the regulatory analysis for this proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the NRC carefully considered the effect on small entities in developing the final rule on decommissioning funding and scaled the requirements to reduce the impact on small entities to the extent possible while adequately protecting health and safety. Therefore, it is not expected to have an impact on licensees not already analyzed in the regulatory flexibility analysis for the decommissioning funding rule as published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on June 27, 1988 (53 FR 24018).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Commission certifies that this proposed rule, if adopted, will not have any additional significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Backfit Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this rule, and therefore, a backfit analysis is not required for this rule because these amendments do not involve any provisions which would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 10 CFR Part 30  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Byproduct material, Criminal penalties, Government contracts, Intergovernmental relations, Isotopes, Nuclear materials, Radiation protection, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 10 CFR Part 40  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Criminal penalties, Government contracts, Hazardous materials_transportation, Nuclear materials, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Source material, Uranium.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 10 CFR Part 70  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Criminal penalties, Hazardous materials_transportation, Material control and accounting, Nuclear materials, Packaging and containers.

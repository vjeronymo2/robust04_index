			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The recovery in US markets helped stock index futures reverse earlier falls to end comfortably above the 3,100 level for the first time in recent sessions, writes Joel Kibazo. The Liffe June contract on the FT-SE 100 finished at 3,127, up 60 from its previous close and 10 points above its fair value premium to cash of about 5 points. Volume was 16,923 lots. Earlier, June retreated from an opening level of 3,050 as dealers reacted to Monday's sharp retreat on Wall Street. It fell to a low of 3,035 in late morning. Signs of a recovery in New York brought a turnround in the contract in the early afternoon and the solid performance from that market created a squeeze in June towards the close of the session. In the Liffe Mid 250, June closed at 3,760 after light trading. Volume was 25 contracts though the screen showed no volume in the same contract on the OMLX. In Liffe traded options, turnover of 37,197 was just shy of Thursday's closing total. However, volume in the FT-SE 100 option showed a substantial improvement reaching 19,256 lots against a previous 14,242 lots. Some 7,532 lots were dealt in the Euro FT-SE 100 option. Glaxo was the most active stock option with a total of 1,063 trades.</p>

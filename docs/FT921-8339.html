			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / EC attempts to revive Yugoslav peace process: Ministers seek to steer course between claims of feuding republics THE EUROPEAN Community yesterday sought to manoeuvre itself into a better position to re-start the Yugoslav peace conference in parallel with the arrival of a United Nations peacekeeping force. The EC's diplomatic moves came as Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary-general, formally asked the UN Security Council in New York to despatch a force of nearly 14,000 to Yugoslavia, initially for 12 months. As part of a carefully balanced diplomatic package of decisions in Lisbon, EC foreign ministers endorsed deployment of the UN force to keep peace between Serbs and Croats. 'It is a risky enterprise,' said Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, 'but the risks of not proceeding (with the UN deployment) are greater than the risks of proceeding.' Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, Portugal's foreign minister, said: 'The arrival of the (UN) blue helmets should be the moment to give new impetus to the peace conference.' To this end, EC ministers sought to steer a more careful course between the various feuding Yugoslav republics: Serbia's leadership was praised for its 'constructive' attitude recently, in particular towards arrival of UN forces. Ministers effectively told President Slobodan Milosevic that Serbia can expect to regain EC trade preferences if he subscribes in writing to the EC's call for inviolability of existing frontiers as the basis for a peace settlement. Ministers proposed that European and national parliamentarians, as well as the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, should supervise the forthcoming referendum on Bosnia-Hercegovina's independence. The ministers seem to want to keep their 200-strong team of official EC monitors out of a republic which could become the next crucible of conflict. Ministers dodged recognition of Macedonia, as strongly requested by their Greek colleague, Mr Andonis Samaras. But Mr Gianni de Michelis, Italy's minister, tartly reminded Mr Samaras of the need to undramatise the issue. Athens fears the republic's use of the name Macedonia will stir irredentist feeling in northern Greece. Laura Silber and Judy Dempsey add: Mr Milan Babic, president of the self-proclaimed Serb republic of Krajina in south-western Croatia, yesterday softened his stance on the UN troops, saying they would not meet 'organised armed resistance'. But their safety could not be guaranteed, he warned. Speaking in Belgrade, the Serbian capital, Mr Babic said he would accept a UN decision to send peacekeepers, but added 'it would be extremely difficult' to disarm the 30,000 Serb reservists and irregulars from Krajina. He rejected some elements of the UN plan on the grounds that it treated Krajina as part of Croatia. But he claimed that the UN secretary-general had met some of his objections by promising that Krajina would not be placed under Croatian jurisdiction, and that the peacekeepers would stay for at least a year.</p>

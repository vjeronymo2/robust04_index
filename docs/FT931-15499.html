			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Technology: Cheaper HDTV in view Two products aimed at breaking through consumer resistance to high-definition television for home use were unveiled by Victor Co of Japan (JVC) last week. The company plans to launch a low-priced HDTV set and HDTV-compatible video cassette recorder in the Japanese domestic market by autumn this year. Huge investment in research and development of HDTV by Japanese companies, and the increasing volume of HDTV broadcasting in Japan, have so far translated into very limited sales of HDTV sets, largely due to the prohibitively high cost of models already on the market. The cheapest HDTV set so far on sale in Japan is a Y1.3m (Pounds 6,800) model from Sony. Other versions, labelled 'Hi-Vision', are half-way houses between HDTV and conventional TV, using simplified decoders which produce picture quality better than ordinary TVs but not up to full HDTV standards. JVC says production costs for its new HDTV will be much lower because of the development of a smaller, simpler but fully-functional decoder requiring fewer integrated circuits. The new sets will go on sale in Japan later this year, priced at less than Y1m, the level at which industry analysts have predicted that sales for home use will take off. However, supplies will reach the shops too late to take advantage of the boom in HDTV sales predicted in the run up to the wedding of the Japanese crown prince this summer. The HDTV video recorder is also to be sold cheaply enough to break into the mass market, at around Y600,000. Using technology known as W-VHS, the machine splits HDTV signals to record them on double-track metal tape. The company stresses that in addition to making high-quality HDTV recordings, it can also play back existing VHS format recordings, and can record two conventional TV programmes simultaneously on the double-track tape. JVC claims the videos will also be compatible with the next generation of HDTV broadcasting systems being planned around the world, not just with the current Japanese Muse format.</p>

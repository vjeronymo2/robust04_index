			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Observer: Docks in the dock John Lenanton, a family-owned timber processor and one of London's oldest industrial companies, is on the point of abandoning its home of the past 157 years. A few well-chosen words from the chairman will be in order, no doubt? Not a bit of it. John Lenanton, great grandson of the founder, cannot wait to exchange the Isle of Dogs in Docklands for a new base in leafy suburban Berkhamsted. After 44 years with the company, he will 'walk away from the area and never look back'. No longer using the Thames to transport its timber, the company is poorly located as regards the bulk of its customers in the construction industry. The principal effect of fronting on to the river these days is that the masonry is in constant need of attention. Fair enough, but Lenanton adds that he has experienced almost no advantage from the wave of investment in Docklands, while the locals are dismissed as a 'load of whingers'. A lack of sentimentality not presumably applauded by the London Docklands Development Corporation.</p>

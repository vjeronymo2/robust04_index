			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Kent Corporation goes into receivership Kent Corporation, the mechanical and electrical contractor and one of Ireland's biggest employers, went into receivership yesterday. The company, which has its headquarters in Tipperary and employs about 6,000, is the latest to fall victim to the construction industry recession. Recent work has included contracts for the troubled Hotel Arts complex in Barcelona and a major electrical engineering contract at Guys Hospital in London, which also has been subject to a dispute. Problems on the hospital contract are thought to have contributed to the group's downfall. Mr Rory O'Ferrall and Mr Patrick Butler of Deloitte &amp; Touche were yesterday appointed receivers to the group. In a separate move Mr Terry Carter and Ms Maggie Mills of Ernst &amp; Young were appointed administrative receivers to Kentz, the UK subsidiary which employs about 500 workers.</p>

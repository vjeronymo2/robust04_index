			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Amin Tahiri] </F>   [Text] "Iran and Iraq have signed a peace treaty." This  interesting news was announced at an economic conference held in  Manama, Bahrain earlier this month by the governor of the  Central Bank of Iran, Mohammed Hoseyn 'Adeli.    However, no sooner had the typewriter begun to record this  news when more informed sources in Tehran denied the report and  described it as "completely devoid of veracity."    One source said, "The governor does not follow foreign  policy." Perhaps he imagines that Iran actually signed a peace  treaty with Iraq.    The matter was quickly forgotten. Undoubtedly, 'Adeli, a  technocrat with little experience in political matters, had  committed an innocent stupidity.    The issue of the future of Iranian-Iraqi relations is always  present on the rare occasions when Iranian foreign policy  options are discussed in a balanced mood, far from provocative  slogans.    Iranian political experts agree that the establishment of a  firm foundation for relations with Iraq is still one of Iran's  most important priorities, inasmuch as the two neighboring  states have been holding talks for more than five years since  agreeing to a UN-sponsored cease-fire. They have also achieved a  better understanding of each other's positions through a number  of high-level contacts. Moreover, if the news coming from Tehran  is correct, Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati will  soon head an official delegation to Baghdad, the "first" of its  kind since the mullahs took power in Iran in 1979.    The idea of an attempt to improve relations with Iraq has  been gaining force in Tehran for a number of reasons: The main  reason is that the pragmatic wing in President Rafsanjani's  leadership has lost much of its influence over formulating  foreign policy. Rafsanjani wanted to bring revolutionary Iran  closer to moderate forces in the region by establishing strong  relations with Western Europe and Japan. A normalization with  the United States is still his medium-term goal.    However, this strategy has failed because potential foreign  partners of Iran have refused to do anything to help strengthen  Rafsanjani's position in Tehran. The general idea abroad is that  if the mullahs are conciliatory, it is because they are weak and  they should therefore not be helped to gain new power. There is  also a strong conviction that the mullahs have not abandoned  their long-range dream of exporting the revolution and  establishing an empire in the name of the Khomeyniist ideology.    Thus, Iran has failed to convince the outside world that it  no longer wants to behave on the basis of an aggressive,  expansionist ideology. Hence, the general hesitation to develop  more than a certain modicum of relations with Iran.    The star of the radical elements in the rightwing leadership  of 'Ali Khamene'i, the supreme leader in Tehran, has risen  again. These elements are advocating a new foreign policy  course. They maintain that the failure of the normalization  policy requires Iran to seek new friends and partners to break  its current isolation. Velayati's recent tour of black Africa  and several formerly communist states in Europe was a part of  this new effort. Political circles in Tehran have also begun to  renew the idea of transforming the dormant Nonaligned Movement  into a "pole" in global politics. Accordingly, Iran's  behind-the-scenes relations with Serbia, the special relations  that have developed between Iran and Ion Iliescu's new communist  government in Romania, and Iran's increasingly close relations  with North Korea are all part of a new strategy.    Regarding the region itself, the weakening of the Gulf  Cooperation Council [GCC] continues to be a priority for Tehran,  which has always considered the GCC a part of the effort to  weaken Iran.    Such weakening is effected in part by encouraging  "disturbances" in the politics of several GCC countries--e.g.,  Oman and Qatar--and by strongly wooing Kuwait, especially by  constantly pointing to the inevitable Iraqi danger.    Outside of the Gulf region, Iran has escalated its efforts  to  expand its influence in Yemen and to build new bridges with  Jordan. The desire to woo the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan has  been so strong that the Iranian Embassy in Jordan actually  heaped praise on King Husayn after Jordan expelled 22 [Iranian]  diplomats from Amman. Relations with Sudan, on the other hand,  have become relatively tepid. This is attributed in part to  Tehran's abhorrence of Hasan al-Turabi's desire to promote  himself as the leader of the fundamentalist movement instead of  Khamene'i.    Iran's relations with Syria have also become tepid, because  Tehran believes that Syria has now certainly joined the  "American camp."    Thus, the dream of Baghdad-Tehran axis now appears more  attractive than at any time in the past. However, the  establishment of such an axis is more easily said than done,  because both countries must first settle their bilateral  conflicts. Moreover, many in Tehran are convinced that President  Saddam Husayn's regime may not last beyond the end of this year,  and Baghdad, for its part, knows that any axis with Tehran would  dash all of its hopes for the lifting of the sanctions imposed  on it and for its return to international society.    In other words, the mullahs cannot achieve any strategic  objective by establishing a firm alliance with Iraq as long as  Saddam is in power. At the same time, Iraq cannot look to Iran  as a strong partner that can fill the vacuum created by the loss  of its relations with the moderate Arab countries and the [West].    Thus, Iranian-Iraqi relations are likely to continue to be  uneven for a period that is certain to continue until the two  countries adopt new policies, perhaps under the auspices of new  leaders. Therefore, it is certain that 'Adeli's announcement of  a peace treaty was premature.</p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / FT Pink Snow (3): The ultimate chalet experience - Lucia van der Post hand-picks a selection on the most pampered pistes THERE COMES a time in many skiers' lives when they tire of messy chalets with too few bathrooms, of hotels filled with the braying of Sloanes at play, of package deals and economy class. What they want, in other words, is something special, something exclusive, which gives them, at least temporarily, the illusion of being in a playground of their own. Ever since the masses took to skiing these places have been harder to find. The really rich and lucky solve the problem with chalets of their own in resorts where they and their friends can gather, safely insulated from the coach and package tour brigade. Then there are the big and grand hotels - The Palace in Gstaad, Suvretta House in St. Moritz, that sort of thing - sumptuous, glitzy, lots of fun - but private, tucked away? No, indubitably no. There are, however, a few special places that cater for those who want something smaller, more intimate, more like a luxury lodge or chalet, which can be filled with nothing but friends, family and like-minded companions. The Ski Company has perfected the idea. It is run by David Kemp, whose notion of what constitutes a truly comfortable skiing holiday coincides almost exactly with mine. His company buys, restores and staffs chalets in and around some of the most agreeable skiing resorts in France (Meribel, Morzine, Val d'Isere and Chamonix). The chalets are furnished as one would oneself had one but the time, the money and the expertise. All the bedrooms have their own bathrooms (queueing for inadequate numbers of bathrooms is, the van der Post sample reveals, the chief reason why as people get older, better off and fonder of their comfort, they abandon the chalet holiday). There are log fires and sitting-rooms, television sets and stereo, books and fruit and magazines . . . all the things that make it seem like home. Many of the chalets, in particular Chalet Gueret, a 200-year-old Savoyard farmhouse near Morzine, are off the beaten track, so The Ski Company provides transport to and from the slopes, giving the best of both worlds - a sense of quiet and privacy coupled with easy access to the lifts. What truly lifts them into the luxury class is the quality of the food and service - champagne before dinner, vintage wines, food that would have the punters queueing up in most cities in the world. Provided you want to ski the resorts the chalets are close to and the number of people in your group coincides with the number of rooms in the chalet, I cannot think of a more cossetted way to go. And as for the prices, for what you get they still seem to me very reasonable - from Pounds 760 a week per person, inclusive of everything except lift passes and ski tuition. For the brochure write to The Ski Company, 41 Hyde Vale, Greenwich, London SE10 8QQ. Tel: 081-305-2299. Quite, quite different is Cordillera, way out West in the Colorado Rockies. Here is a little-known, tucked away resort, set in 3,000 acres at 8,000 feet with spectacular views of the Rockies in almost every direction. Just five years ago there was nothing but mountain, forest and wilderness. Today there are 15 miles of groomed cross-country trails, a pond for ice-skating, sleigh rides through the forest, snowmobiling, snow-shoeing (the sort of thing the pioneers did) and chances of wild back country skiing using snowcats or helicopters. Though private houses are being built at discreet intervals around the resort for those who just want to drop in for a few days or a week or two there are two possibilities - there is the small and intimate 27-bedroom lodge, which can be booked in its entirety or used just like a hotel (prices start at Dollars 175 - Pounds 107 - a night) or you could rent a small private home. With five double bedrooms, every conceivable new-world mod-con, it would cost Dollars 1,000 (Pounds 613) for a single night but the longer you rent it the less it costs per night. The food at The Lodge, rumour has it, is about the best in the West - a Belgian chef is bringing in diners from the nearby resorts as well as those who would not know a schuss from a snow-plough. And if all that food starts putting on the pounds, head for the Spa at The Lodge where you can be honed back into shape. The piste-bashing brigade should note that Cordillera itself has no downhill pistes of its own but it is just 10 minutes from Beaver Creek (where the really classy set go to ski, right away from all louder, less well-bred resorts) and 15 or 20 minutes from Vail. Buses (provided free) go to and fro. It is, above all, the ideal resort for fanatical skiers who are always worried about how their non-skiing partners or friends will be amused whilst their are busy tackling black runs - in Cordillera there is more than enough to keep them happy. Flights from Europe go to Denver but within the US American Airlines flies into a new airport, Eagle, just five minutes from Cordillera. For more details about The Lodge or renting the private home write to PO Box 1110, Edwards, Vail Valley, Colorado 81632. Tel: 303-926-2200. Back in Europe, there are two hotels that really offer something special. In Lenzerheide, Switzerland, there is the Hotel Guarda Val which is quite unlike any other hotel - pitched right up the mountain, away from the bustle of the village, on a 'mid-alp' (where the old Swiss farmers used to take the cows for the spring thaw), the old Graubunden farm buildings have been converted into a wonderfully idiosyncratic hotel. The hotel can take some 80 guests but because they are all in rooms and studios, in four-bedroomed chalets and gable rooms, the sense of privacy and quiet is great. A big old barn has been converted into the restaurant and another old building is now a pub. Not the place for the disco-hopping set, this is for those who like to be surrounded by snow and mountains. One week in January, half board, with scheduled flights is Pounds 776 per person sharing a double room with own bathroom, through Made to Measure Holidays, 43, East Street, Chichester, West Sussex PO19 1HX, England. The other hotel worth knowing about is Le Chalet in Meribel, which no serious skier needs reminding is one of the great French skiing resorts. Housed in a grand Savoyarde farmhouse, with just 34 bedrooms, Le Chalet is a great place for families - a huge log fire burns in the sitting-room, there is a library, really comfortable bedrooms (some with jacuzzis, some suites with sitting-rooms and your very own log-fires, yet others with a second room on a mezzanine floor to make it like a family apartment) and lots of thoughtful provision for the children (for instance, a games room, a film every afternoon, special meals, where the children can all eat together leaving the parents free to dine alone or with friends). Close to the pistes of Meribel-les-Allues, surrounded by pine, spruce and maple, but some distance from the town, Le Chalet manages to combine the feeling of a private chalet with the services of a high-quality hotel. Prices start at about Pounds 110 per person per night. Book direct at Le Chalet, Le Belvedere, 73550 Meribel-les-Allues, France. Tel 79 00 55 71.</p>

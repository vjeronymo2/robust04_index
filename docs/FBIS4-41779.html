			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow BASAPRESS, 24/6/1994 -- The president of the  self-proclaimed Dniester Republic, Igor Smirnov, held a press  conference at the headquarters of the Moscow newspaper  SOVYETSKAYA ROSSIYA (SOVIET RUSSIA.) The Tiraspol leader  declared that the latest negotiations with the Chisinau  authorities proved that the political solution of the conflict  is still indefinite; economic relations with Moldova first need  to be restored. Smirnov stated that the 14th Russian Army is  not willing to contribute to the solution of the conflict,  because the soldiers benefit from high incomes for their service  in a "conflict zone." According to the Dniester leader,  Tiraspol presently has claims to the assets of the military  units which are to be evacuated from the Eastern regions; it  also intends to inherit the rest of the 14th Army property after  the latter leaves the region for good. "[14th Army Commander  General Aleksandr] Lebed inherited the military equipment and  ammunitions of the entire south-western sector of the Soviet  Army. We have been a part of the USSR; we paid taxes and now  have full rights to possess the property of the troops on our  territory," said Smirnov. Commenting on the latent conflict  between the Tiraspol authorities and the commander of the 14th  Army, Smirnov stated that "the necessity to search for corrupt  persons is a feature of Lebed's character" and, eventually, it  will be of great use if he returns to Russia. "I do not think I  should argue with or deny Lebed's declarations," [accusing the  Dniester leaders of corruption] mentioned the Tiraspol leader,  reminding that during the recent celebrations on 19 June  dedicated to the second anniversary of the tragic events in  Bender, Commander Lebed was booed by the audience.</p>

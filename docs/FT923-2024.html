			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Food and Wine: If it's September, it must be onions - Cookery THE SIGHT of button onions and courgettes galore in the shops and markets is a sure sign that September is here. The other thing that unites these otherwise disparate ingredients is that each can be absolutely delicious or remarkably nasty, depending on the mercy of the cook. Just to think about pickled onions, sozzled brutally with vinegar, sets my teeth on edge. On the other hand, the gluttonous memory of a dish of buttery, glazed onions served with a leg of lamb last Sunday sets the saliva sprinting. Overgrown courgettes lack finesse. I would rather have good, honest marrow. Miniature courgettes are as bad as bloated big ones. I have only bought dwarf courgettes once - and that was once too often. Did I strike unlucky with a particularly unfortunate batch or are they always tasteless, bordering on unpleasant? The price of the dwarf offerings from Thailand also was hard to swallow. Smallish, youthful and very fresh courgettes are the only truly desirable sort. Ideally, they should be picked so recently that they come complete with flowers at their tips blooming brightly. Then, you can enjoy a double treat. GLAZED ONIONS WITH CINNAMON (serves 5-6) Apart from the chore of peeling, this is quick and easy. It is excellent with grilled chicken, chops and steaks, roasted meats and game birds. Unless you hand-pick each onion when shopping, it is best to buy 2lb or so. That way, all the onions used for this recipe can be more or less uniform in size; save the runts and the fatties for other dishes. Ingredients: 1 1/2 lb pickling onions; scant 1 1/2 oz unsalted or clarified butter; 1 slightly heaped teaspoon of sugar; a pinch of ground cinnamon (or freshly grated nutmeg or chopped parsley for serving). Method: Peel the onions and choose a heavy-based pan or flameproof casserole into which they will fit, as near as possible, in a single layer. Heat the pot and melt the butter in it. Add the onions and turn them to coat all over with fat. Sprinkle on the sugar, stir again, and cook half-covered over moderate to low heat (for 15-20 minutes depending on the size of the onions) until tender, streaked with gold and caramelised here and there. Stir the onions occasionally as they cook. (Turn the heat right down, or cover the pan completely, if they are browning too fast or if too much moisture is being lost). Onions cooked this way can be kept hot for some while without spoiling. Season and dust with cinnamon (or nutmeg or parsley) just before serving. COURGETTES FRIED WITH THEIR FLOWERS (serves 4) Life is too short to stuff a flower. Nor do I bother to dip courgette flowers in batter before frying. Simply dusting them with well-seasoned flour seems to me as much embellishment as they need. Ingredients: 8 small courgettes complete with their flowers (plus extra courgette flowers if available); a few black olives (preferably tiny ones from Provence); half a lemon; the leaves stripped from a sprig or two of thyme (preferably lemon thyme); a little chopped parsley; olive oil; a little well-seasoned flour. Method: Separate the flowers from the vegetables and slice the courgettes. Check that the flowers are clean and cut each one down its entire length on one side, from the tip of the petal to the juicy, thick base. Remove the pistil, fan the flower open so it lies flat and cut into two or three pieces. Saute the sliced courgettes until just tender in a hot pan barely filmed with oil. Do not cook them so long that the skins lose their fresh green colour. Transfer them to a shallow serving dish. Add the olives, herbs, citrus zest, a pinch of salt and a squeeze of lemon juice. Toss to mix and keep hot in a low oven. Quickly add extra oil to the pan - to about a quarter-inch deep. Dust the flowers with well-seasoned flour and fry them very briefly so they become wafery crisp, yet retain their lime green and gold colouring. Drain the flowers well, arrange them in a garland around the courgettes and serve straight away.</p>

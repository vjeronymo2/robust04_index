He said the call was for a conference on  Bosnia and it came from President Boris Yeltsin. The United  States, German, British, French, and Greek Governments had  already been notified. Kozyrev made the statement after he met  with his Greek, Belgian, and German counterparts in Athens.  Speaking with newsmen in the Greek capital, he stated Yeltsin's  call for the Serbs to remove their heavy weapons and the Serbs'  willingness to meet this call created favorable conditions for a  peace settlement. The minister said Russian peacekeepers were  ready to be deployed in Sarajevo and other areas of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. A spokesman for the United Nations has told  the French news agency 400 troops of the Russian battalion based  in eastern Croatia have started moving toward Sarajevo.</p>

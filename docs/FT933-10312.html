			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Secret service scandal seizes the Czech imagination: Patrick Blum on charges of the sale of confidential information THE indictment last week by a Prague military court of a secret service agent threatens to open a corruption scandal involving the Czech Republic's secret service, a maverick businessman and leading politicians. All have been drawn into a web of allegations made by Mr Vaclav Wallis, a 48-year-old former member of the StB, the communist secret police. Mr Wallis is awaiting trial on charges of selling private and economic information gathered by the secret services before and after the 'velvet' revolution which overthrew communism in 1989. The scandal has been fed by a daily diet of news and 'revelations' which has occupied the front pages of local newspapers since Mr Wallis's indictment, leading to intense speculation over exactly what and who are involved. Czech television last week said these included confidential information on the government's privatisation programme, as well as potentially compromising information on the private lives of senior Czech politicians, including President Vaclav Havel and Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. The information is said to have been gathered by the StB, and later by the Federal Security Information Service (FBIS) established in 1991 to replace the hated StB, and collected within a special file of 'Personalities in Political and Economic Life'. The FBIS itself was succeeded by a new Security Information Service (BIS) at the end of last year, not long before the break-up of the former Czechoslovakia into separate Czech and Slovak states. Critics say it continues to harbour many former employees of the FBIS and its Stalinist predecessor. The recipient of at least part of this information was Mr Viktor Kozeny, a controversial young entrepreneur and head of Harvard Capital and Consulting (HC&amp;C) - one of the country's largest voucher privatisation funds whose shareholdings have an estimated book value of about Dollars 600m and a market value more than double that. Mr Kozeny admits he paid up to Kcs500,000 (Pounds 12,000) to Mr Wallis, but he says this was because Mr Wallis was blackmailing him by threatening to reveal damaging information about himself and his business. In a statement on Tuesday, Mr Kozeny said: 'I was blackmailed by a man whose real function as employee of this institution (the FBIS) was not known to me. Neither I nor Harvard Fund have anything to hide.' Mr Wallis says he supplied the information - including information gathered by the FBIS on HC&amp;C - at Mr Kozeny's request. According to CTK, the Czech news agency, the information was passed on to Mr Kozeny between March and December 1992. Mr Wallis was arrested on December 7 while passing information to and accepting Kcs100,000 in payment from Mr Kozeny, who had informed the FBIS. Mr Wallis was indicted on charges of abuse of public office and divulging state secrets and faces up to 10 years in jail if found guilty. Mr Kozeny is the main witness in the case against Mr Wallis and faces no charges himself. Mr Kozeny, who set up HC&amp;C with Dollars 3,000 to make it a major shareholder of some of the Czech Republic's most important financial institutions and companies, has faced controversy before. HC&amp;C was investigated by the secret police in 1991, and in January last year, Lidove Noviny, a respected daily newspaper, revealed that several of its employees were former StB and interior ministry officials. Mr Kozeny's rapid success and somewhat brash style have made him many enemies as well as admirers among Prague's small business and political community. At the weekend, several newspapers questioned Mr Kozeny's version of events, and Lidove Noviny said it was unusual for a blackmailer to make gifts even in the shape of confidential information to the person he was blackmailing. Local observers believe the scandal is the most visible sign yet of a growing web of corruption which involves former communist officials, organised crime, politicians and businessmen. Mr Jiri Dienstbier, former dissident and foreign minister after the revolution, last week said: 'The Wallis affair is like the tip of the iceberg of a whole system of corruption which is spreading here.' The Wallis affair, as it is now known, follows a smaller scandal involving the illegal sale of personal data on 2m Czechs from the interior ministry's central registry to a private company which, it was alleged, promptly sold it to Procter and Gamble for an advertising campaign. An investigation ended inconclusively in June. 'It was impossible to find out the source (for the information) in an official and legal way,' said Mr Petr Zelasko, a police official.</p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEGAL VIEW: USEFUL LAWBOOK FOR EVERYDAY LIFE  </P> <P> The old expression, "a little knowledge is a dangerous thing" tells only part  of the story. No knowledge at all can be even more dangerous.  </P> <P> When it comes to legal information, even a little knowledge can go a long way,  especially if you know how to use it. And that means more than trying to  impress your friends during cocktail party chatter.  </P> <P> Understanding the law can help you deal with many everyday situations and  challenges, from buying insurance to buying a car. It is even useful when you  are already represented by a lawyer. The more you know, the better client you  can be.  </P> <P> "You and the Law," a new, large-format (8 1/2x11), 608-page book published by  the American Bar Assn., and written by more than 15 experts, is a good way to  learn the law. Of course, no single book, even one as large as this one, can  tell everything consumers need to know.  </P> <P> One key element is to know when and how to use a lawyer, and this book has an  entire chapter devoted to that subject. Of course, "you do not need a lawyer  every time you become involved with the law," as the authors note early on,  while explaining how to get help from sources other than lawyers.  </P> <P> When people think of the law, they usually think about the court system, which  is explained in some detail in one chapter, but much of the law exists outside  the court system.  </P> <P> The law enters into nearly all aspects of daily living. It is there in some way  every time you write a check, sign a document, move into a new house or  apartment, start a new job or business, or use a credit card -- even when you  get married.  </P> <P> The legal system touches much more than criminal and civil trials. Courts are  necessary to resolve significant civil disputes that cannot be resolved by some  other means such as settlement, arbitration or mediation. Questions come up  every day that require legal information to answer, but will never wind up in  the courts.  </P> <P> And the question-answer format of this thick resource helps you quickly find  the information you need.  </P> <P> "Read before you sign" warns one page that summarizes typical language in a  lease. What makes this analysis different from similar warnings in other  self-help books is that it contains a detailed explanation of typical clauses  in a lease and then describes what the provision would say in a "pro-landlord  lease" and what it should say in a "balanced lease." Those tips will help  readers understand and negotiate their own leases.  </P> <P> Many of the laws that govern our lives are state statutes and court decisions  that are not the same everywhere. That's one of the pitfalls of writing a  consumer law text that promises "instant help for hundreds of common legal  problems."  </P> <P> The authors help solve that problem by providing charts with specific  information on a state by state basis, showing differences in such areas as  spousal property ownership rules, child restraint laws and accident report  filing requirements.  </P> <P> Each chapter concludes with a section telling the reader where to find more  information, including free or inexpensive publications, government agencies or  other groups. There is a useful glossary and index.  </P> <P> You can buy this book from a bookstore or send a check for $19.95 plus $3.95  for shipping and handling to American Bar Assn., Order Fulfillment/PC235-0019,  750 N. Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, Ill. 60611.  </P></p>

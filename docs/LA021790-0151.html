			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WETLANDS BACKERS HOPE SPILL WILL RESULT IN ZONING  </P> <P> Environmentalists said Friday they hope to ride a wave of publicity generated  by the recent oil spill to achieve long-sought protective zoning for the  coastal wetlands.  </P> <P> Since the Feb. 7 oil spill, national news media have frequently referred to the  endangered wetlands in Huntington Beach. That attention, the environmentalists  said, will make it difficult for the City Council to turn its back on  protective zoning for 225 acres of marshland between Beach Boulevard and the  Santa Ana River.  </P> <P> While the oil spill danger was great, inaction by city government in protecting  those wetlands is a more serious threat, the environmentalists said on Friday.  </P> <P> "A far greater danger . . . is the possibility of commercial or residential  development" on those wetlands, said Chuck Gant, president of Friends of the  Huntington Beach Wetlands.  </P> <P> Wetlands are marshy areas that serve as home for a wide range of rare plants,  birds and small animals. Few wetlands remain in Southern California because of  urban growth.  </P> <P> Gordon Smith, chairman of the Huntington Beach Wetlands Conservancy, added:  "Mother Nature is remarkably resilient, and the wetlands would eventually  recover from the effects of an oil spill. But the destructive consequences of  development on the wetlands are permanent."  </P> <P> The City Council has scheduled a public hearing on the unzoned wetlands for its  meeting at 7 p.m. Tuesday at City Hall.  </P> <P> Environmentalists have been trying for the past 10 years to get the City  Council to put a "conservation zoning" on the marshlands. That type of zoning  would restrict commercial and residential development.  </P> <P> Most of the 225 acres in the marsh area have been cut off by Pacific Coast  Highway from getting tidal water from the ocean. But almost all of the acreage  can be restored to true wetlands conditions, as has 25 acres in the Talbert  Channel area, environmentalists have said.  </P> <P> Gant said he hoped the City Council may be swayed by a compromise the  environmentalists reached with a special study group appointed last fall by the  council.  </P> <P> That compromise calls for giving one major landowner the option for limited oil  exploration in the wetlands area on a one-acre site, Gant said.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, heavy debate is expected at the Tuesday council meeting, according  to other environmentalists. Some council members have said they believe that  "conservation zoning" would constitute illegal seizure of the marshlands from  its private owners. The city then might have to pay millions of dollars in  compensation to the landowners, they say.  </P> <P> Gant, however, said legal opinions given by two lawyers hired to study the  matter have said the proposed zoning would not be a seizure of the lands.  </P></p>

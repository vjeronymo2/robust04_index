			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Consortium acquires MCC's Panini offshoot PRICE Waterhouse, administrator of Maxwell Communication Corporation, yesterday sold another slice of the empire - Panini, the Italian childrens' stickers company. MC Italia, holding company of Panini, which Mr Robert Maxwell tried unsuccessfully to sell in his lifetime, has been sold to a consortium of investors led by Bain Gallo Cuneo Capital Investments. The purchase price was not disclosed. The sale follows the announcement on Monday that Price Waterhouse had sold MCC's 75 per cent stake in Nimbus Records, the compact disc manufacturer and record label. Mr Jonathan Phillips, one of the joint administrators, said yesterday that the sale represented a very satisfactory outcome for MCC's creditors. After the sale of the Nimbus stake the disposal of MCC's non-US business assets was largely complete. The Panini deal was conducted through an international auction. It was the first MCC disposal to require the approval of the US Bankruptcy Court. Panini, which produces football stickers, is based in Modena.</p>

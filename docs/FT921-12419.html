			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Dr Bush makes a faulty diagnosis: Michael Prowse on America I'll do it my way,' sang Frank Sinatra. This, in a nutshell, appears to be President George Bush's approach to health care. In tomorrow's State of the Union address, Mr Bush is expected to end three years of procrastination and unveil radical reform proposals. This is a great step forward for a president who used to 'switch off' when aides raised questions about escalating costs or the plight of the 35m uninsured Americans. The problem is that he appears unwilling to heed lessons learned throughout the developed world. Governments everywhere have found that costs can be controlled and access to care guaranteed only by expanding the public sector's role. The US has tried to buck this trend and ended up with by far the worst record on both costs and access. Instead of finally recognising the need for tougher public regulation of the private sector - an option favoured by many Democrats - Mr Bush is pining his hopes on yet another 'market-oriented' reform. The main elements are expected to include: Refundable tax credits to help the poor purchase insurance cover. Reforms of private health insurance to discourage discrimination against small business and high-risk individuals. A cap on tax relief on employer schemes for high earners. Means-testing of Medicare, the universal public-sector scheme for the elderly. Incentives for pre-paid (and thus supposedly economical) health care systems such as Health Maintenance Organisations (HMOs). Taken individually, a case can be made for all of these measures. But they do not amount to a coherent strategy. The ideas are mostly drawn from reform plans put forward by conservative groups such as the Heritage Foundation, a Washington think tank. The conservative diagnosis of the problem lays heavy stress on misguided tax policies. Conservatives argue that the US's biggest mistake is to provide open-ended tax relief for employer schemes. This is allegedly economically inefficient because employees, regarding health care as an obligation of employers, have little regard for its cost. It is unfair because the subsidy - worth some Dollars 50bn-Dollars 60bn a year - goes disproportionately to the well-paid, who enjoy the most lavish care. The solution touted is a 'Robin Hood' reform. Eliminate tax relief for employer schemes and shift primary responsibility for health care to individuals. People will then shop around for the best value health insurance, putting sustained downward pressure on costs. Use the money saved to provide income-related tax credits for individuals thus ensuring that the low-paid can afford health insurance. Give the poorest grants sufficient to pay for a basic level of insurance cover. By rejigging the tax system, the argument runs, you can control costs and close gaps in health care coverage. In some proposals, Medicare and Medicaid, the public-sector schemes for the elderly and poor, disappear altogether. But if they were to continue, means-testing of benefits for the better off would help finance care for the poor. And everybody in public schemes would be given an incentive to enter HMOs and other forms of managed care. Additional incentives to control costs in the private sector might be unnecessary, enthusiasts claim, if most individuals personally bore the full costs of health insurance. These radical free market plans may look appealing on paper. But their practical relevance is limited. No administration would be likely to attempt Robin Hood transfers on the scale needed. The Bush plan (which Congress will probably veto anyway) is expected to cap tax relief on employer schemes only for the few per cent of families earning more than Dollars 125,000 a year. Most health benefits even for these families would remain tax free. The tax credits for poor families are expected to be about Dollars 500 to Dollars 1,500, nowhere near large enough to cover the cost of premiums, which averaged nearly Dollars 4,000 last year. The credits will also probably be phased out a little above poverty-line incomes, meaning that many uninsured would not qualify for relief anyway. Fiscal tinkering on this scale will do little either to control health care costs or extend insurance cover. The logic behind the more radical free market plans is anyway deeply suspect. It is unreasonable to argue that health care costs are out of control primarily because of tax distortions. US workers already bear a much higher proportion of direct health costs than their counterparts elsewhere. The fundamental causes of cost inflation are the diffusion of expensive technology and the ability of suppliers of health care - the medical profession - to determine demand by stipulating the level of care that is necessary. The only plausible way to control costs is for public agencies to impose direct budget controls on hospitals and doctors. The notion that tax credits - however generous - would solve the problem of access to care is equally misguided. Many people would fail to buy insurance, just as they fail to save for old age. Administrative costs would anyway be prohibitive, perhaps absorbing as much as 40 per cent of premiums. Every other country has guaranteed access to care through some form of national health insurance financed either through taxes or payroll levies. Mr Bush prides himself on being an internationalist. Why cannot he accept that on health care, it is the US, rather than the rest of the world, that is marching out of step?</p>

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Labour awaits Dudley's verdict The electors of Dudley West will today give the new Labour party of Mr Tony Blair the first indication of how successful it has been in trying to convince longstanding Conservative voters that it is the most reliable guardian of their interests. The result of the by-election in the West Midlands constituency will indicate the depth of the loyalty of voters who turned towards the Conservatives between 1979 and 1987, when the Tory majority increased from 1,139 to 10,224. Opinion polls during the campaign have suggested that the Conservative share of the vote could drop from 48.8 per cent, recorded at the 1992 general election, to about 20 per cent. But Conservative and Labour officials have responded cautiously to the polls. One side is anxious to keep up morale, the other to dampen expectation of a landslide. Both agree that their ability to bring out the vote, at an unfriendly time of the year for a by-election, is crucial. The constituency is one of the more prosperous in the Midlands with owner-occupier rates in line with the leafy dormitory towns of south-east England. It was 54th on Labour's list of seats necessary to win the last general election. In the event, Dr John Blackburn, whose death in October caused the by-election, held it with a majority of 5,789. The campaign has attracted the participation of more senior members of the Labour party than senior members of the government. They played their part - twice in the case of Mr Blair and Mr John Prescott, his deputy - in the usual by-election rituals: canvassing, leaflet-dropping, personal appearances in the hope of attracting a television camera and political argument by press conference. The conduct of the rituals has been generally well-mannered. Both Conservatives and Labour claim to have spent their time arguing the national issues of the day. This, with the exception of the Conservative attempt to pin the label of militant on Mr Ian Pearson, the Labour candidate, and to bring specifically local issues such as Dudley car-parking charges into the campaign, is a fair claim. But for the government Dudley West has been put in the shade by embarrassing events at Westminster - the row over value added tax, the European arguments, the mini-Budget. The constituency has been a local outpost of the national debate. So the Tories inevitably looked for issues to spice the campaign and to take themselves off the defensive.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Progress has been made in the talks between  Israel and the PLO in Cairo. Negotiations on the issue of  protection for the Palestinians in Hebron may be completed by  the end of the week. This was stated by Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres stated yesterday at the end of a meeting with U.S. peace  talks coordinator Dennis Ross. Peres stressed that before it  proceeds to promote the Syrian track, Israel must reach an  agreement with the Palestinians about the continuation of the  peace process. Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports:    [Begin recording] [Segal] By the end of the week the  Israeli and PLO delegations meeting in Cairo will conclude the  elements of the Hebron package which will enable the resumption  of the negotiations on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho  agreement, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres assessed last night.  According to reports received in Jerusalem from the delegation  headed by Major General Amnon Shahaq and Foreign Ministry  Director General Uri Savir, progress has been made in the two  main issues -- the urban police force in Hebron and the nature  of the international presence -- but no agreement has yet been  reached.    At this point, it seems that Peres will not go to Cairo to  confer with PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat. However, one person who  will be going to Cairo is U.S. peace talks coordinator Dennis  Ross. After meeting him last night, Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres commented on Israel's priorities in the peace process.    [Peres] If we reach an agreement with the Palestinians, the  Syrian track will open. First of all, we must attain an  agreement with the Palestinians and overcome all the unsolved  problems. I think all of us will make a supreme effort to  overcome them. We will see what happens in the next few days.    [Segal] In his meeting with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin,  Ross said he had found in Tunis a totally different 'Arafat than  a week ago. 'Arafat is sure of himself, feels encouraged, and  is prepared to make decisions, Ross told the Israelis.    The Syrian track did not come up in the meeting of the  Israeli and U.S. teams, but only in the tete-a-tete meeting  between Ross and Rabin. The impression is that Ross did not  bring any dramatic tidings on the Syrian track. [passage  omitted]    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0505 GMT on 24 March  carries an interview By Gid'on Remez with Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin recorded after his meeting with Ross. Asked whether he  shares the U.S. assessment about an imminent resumption of the  peace negotiations, Rabin says: "First of all, I can tell you  that the negotiations and dialogue in Cairo are a fact. Second,  the U.S. peace team headed by Dennis Ross informed us that the  Arab countries consent to resume the negotiations in Washington  by the end of April, or maybe earlier."    [Asked whether the issue of an international presence in the  territories has been settled, the prime minister says: "I will  not go into details before the dialogue in Cairo is completed."    [Asked whether he is apprehensive that the Russians might  attribute to themselves the success of resuming the process,  Rabin replies: "I very much hope the process will resume by the  end of April."]    [A report by political correspondent Shim'on Schiffer on  pages 1 and 19 of Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 24  March adds that Ross quoted al-Asad as having told him that "if  Rabin wants peace in the northern border and the military  operations against Israel to stop, he must reach a comprehensive  settlement of the conflict in the region with Syria."    [Al-Asad went on to say that he is trying to curb Hizballah  and the Palestinian organizations operating against Israel, but  he cannot promise an "hermetical closure" of the northern border  against activities from Lebanon.    [Ross is reported to have told his Israeli counterparts that  "al-Asad is aware of the fact that the time left to reach an  arrangement in the region is running out."]</p>

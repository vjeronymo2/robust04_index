			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL REPORT;  </P> <P> DIVERSITY MARKS NEW ANTI-WAR MOVEMENT;  </P> <P> PROTEST: SOUTHLAND COALITION LAGS NATIONAL EFFORT, BUT IS GROWING BY ENLISTING  VETERAN ACTIVISTS AND NEOPHYTES.  </P> <P> Al Jacobs, a Los Angeles engineer whose son is serving in the Persian Gulf,  voted for President Bush. But now he plans to march against him.  </P> <P> Shirley Cereseto of Orange County has been an anti-war protester since the  death of her husband in World War II.  </P> <P> Mark Thayler, a 19-year-old Riverside college student, opposes the buildup in  the Mideast, fearing he will be drafted.  </P> <P> Their reasons for opposing U.S. involvement in the Persian Gulf are as varied  as their backgrounds.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, they are part of a small but growing and highly eclectic peace  movement across the Southland that has become more vocal as a Jan. 15 deadline  for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait nears. Even Saddam Hussein's decision to free  foreign hostages has fueled -- rather than defused -- their furor.  </P> <P> "We won't be deterred until we see President Bush taking the troops out," said  Carol Jahnkow, director of the Peace Resource Center in San Diego. "If  anything, people are seeing progress, and we want to keep up our efforts."  </P> <P> To be sure, protests in the Southland have yet to draw the numbers that marches  and rallies have drawn across the country.  </P> <P> On Oct. 20, a day selected by a network of peace organizations for nationwide  protests, 4,000 people marched down Broadway to Times Square in New York; 1,500  raised their voices in San Francisco. But in Los Angeles, there were only 400.  </P> <P> The reason for the smaller crowds here may lie in the nature of the region  itself. It is more difficult to spawn a movement in Southern California cities  than in other major cities, organizers say. "It is simply harder to get people  out of their houses in L. A." said Leila Rand, a spokeswoman with the Los  Angeles Coalition Against U.S. Intervention in the Middle East. "When you have  a demonstration in L. A., how far are you expecting people to drive?"  </P> <P> But while scattered protests drew only a handful of demonstrators months ago,  rallies now draw scores, even hundreds. Throughout the region, an event is  planned virtually every week, often by groups newly formed in response to U.S.  involvement in the Mideast.  </P> <P> Today, a teach-in organized by the Los Angeles Coalition Against U.S.  Intervention in the Middle East is scheduled at Fairfax High School in Los  Angeles. In several cities and towns, including Los Angeles, San Diego, Laguna  Beach and Seal Beach, small rallies are held every weekend. Some, like a recent  one at Mile Square Park in Fountain Valley, drew 400 people.  </P> <P> "Is anti-war sentiment growing?" asked one father, whose son was deployed to  the Middle East. "No, it is exploding."  </P> <P> "Even in Orange County, we have a peace movement -- and we are usually not out  in front in those things," said Cereseto, 68, a peace activist for about 50  years and a founder of the month-old Orange County Coalition for Peace in the  Middle East. This group, like others in the Southland, is circulating petitions  to be presented to Bush in January, as well as organizing teach-ins at colleges  and high schools.  </P> <P> Among the activists are offspring of Vietnam-era protesters and longtime  members of peace organizations who have remained involved over the years in  anti-nuclear weapons and environmental movements.  </P> <P> Others, such as Jeanne and Bruce Ertle, are new to anti-war protests.  </P> <P> The Ertles, of San Diego, recently joined the weekly Sunday peace vigil in  Balboa Park. Their two sons, Stephan, 19, and Jeffrey, 24, have joined them in  opposing the use of U.S. military force, which, they say, would divert funds  from more necessary programs for the poor. And such a venture, they say, would  only create more unrest in the already-tense Middle East.  </P> <P> "If we do this, it's going to create an endless chain of problems later because  we are going to alienate the Arab world," said Bruce Ertle, 50, a graphic  artist who had traditionally voted Republican and grew up in a military family.  </P> <P> Also among the ranks are people like Al and Norma Jacobs, who have sons or  daughters, husbands or wives who have been sent to the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> "I am not a peacenik or a flower child; I am just a guy who has a son out in  the Persian Gulf and who sees all these young fellas out there," Al Jacobs  said. "Bush is not God. And what he's doing now really doesn't make sense."  </P> <P> For the Jacobses, the gulf crisis has forced them to accept political allies  among people they might ordinarily avoid. Unlike some of the more ardent  anti-war activists, they shun such radical acts as flag burning. In fact,  alarmed by what they regarded as unpatriotic rhetoric, the couple walked out of  their first political meeting two weeks ago in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> But the Jacobses quickly realized they could ill afford to ignore what they now  regard as the other half of the peace movement, the more traditional activists.  Today, they have united in their efforts to organize a nationwide demonstration  in early January.  </P> <P> Although the movement's leaders are buoyed by the diversity the anti-war effort  has attracted, it presents a dilemma as well.  </P> <P> To accommodate political neophytes and longtime protesters, organizers say,  they must focus their message carefully: They oppose the war and support the  troops. The theme represents a major departure from the Vietnam War protests,  when the soldiers themselves were often the target of anti-war sentiment.  </P> <P> During a recent meeting at a San Diego law school, for example, more than 100  activists hotly debated whether to stage protests at the docks when Navy ships  left for the gulf.  </P> <P> "You would be dividing my loyalties since my wife will be on one of those  ships," said Mike Meyer, a 26-year-old San Diego student who left the Navy  after four years of service.  </P> <P> With an almost unanimous vote, the group decided that a dockside protest would  be more damaging than helpful by alienating military families. Instead, they  opted for a press conference at a separate location and a different time,  vowing to come up with good visuals for television cameras.  </P> <P> Tools of the movement include petitions, letters to politicians and  demonstrations.  </P> <P> Activists plan fund raising, hone strategies for obtaining big-name stars, and  calculate how to woo the media. So far, those efforts have met with limited  success. Actor Ed Asner and singer Holly Near have signed on to participate in  today's Los Angeles teach-in.  </P> <P> The memory of Vietnam has enabled organizers to pull together groups in a  relatively short time. In the Vietnam War era, many religious leaders waited a  decade before they voiced their opposition. But shortly after Iraq invaded  Kuwait, some -- from Catholics to Lutherans to Episcopalians -- began opposing  the possible use of U.S. military force.  </P> <P> "There is much more awareness now than there ever was at this stage in Vietnam  because people have learned from the past," said Edna Bonacich, professor of  sociology and ethnic studies at UC Riverside. "In Vietnam, we had the enemy  'communist' who gave the war a lot of legitimacy. Now people are asking: 'What  are we doing there? Are we fighting for oil, and it isn't even our oil? Would  we invade if this was not oil territory, if Kuwait was producing potatoes?' "  </P> <P> But, they acknowledge, there are important differences between the anti-war  climate now and in the 1960s. Because body bags have not come home, this  conflict is not yet one of life and death. Because there is no draft, anti-war  sentiment has not ignited college students.  </P> <P> To Bonacich's frustration, public opinion polls have a mixed message. According  to a new Times Poll, 61% approve of Bush's actions, an increase from 54% in  November -- but still lower than September's 78%. Asked what the U.S. should do  once the hostages are free, 37% backed invading Iraq if it refuses to pull out  of Kuwait. However, in a Newsweek poll a week ago, a majority of Americans --  56% -- supported military action.  </P> <P> Disturbed by what she viewed as students' passivity, Bonacich helped form a  small group of politically concerned students and teachers. This month, for the  first time, the group orchestrated a rally of about 100 people on the small,  conservative campus. Alarmed about the possibility of the draft's being  reinstated, sophomore Mark Thayler joined the protest.  </P> <P> "When you are 19, listening to the news and hearing the President try to sell  the idea of war," Thayler said, "you realize, 'I am one of those lives he is  talking about sending over there.' "  </P> <P> For Pat Laru and many others, protest is the only action they can take to make  them feel less powerless.  </P> <P> Laru, a 54-year-old clerical supervisor with San Diego's probation department,  can scarcely believe she is once again protesting for peace. Laru, who  describes herself as an ardent feminist and a single mother, burned effigies of  the governor during the anti-war movement in Cambridge, Mass., in the '60s.  </P> <P> When her son, Jeff, joined the Marine Corps two years ago, she figured it was  the ultimate rebellion of a young man who grew up in a liberal home. She  demanded he see violent Vietnam movies -- "Platoon," "Full Metal Jacket,"  "Apocalypse Now" -- but had no luck in dissuading him.  </P> <P> Jeff, now 21, called two weeks ago and haltingly told her his unit was being  shipped out to the Persian Gulf area. His words electrified her with fear. She  said they discussed various ways he could avoid being deployed: start a barroom  brawl, lie to his supervisor and say he was gay, or apply for  conscientious-objector status.  </P> <P> Laru advised her boy, "Save your skin," and when the call ended, she wept. Now  she regrets that she had not forcefully prohibited her son from joining the  Marines. She also regrets that she had not earned more money so she could have  offered her son more options after he graduated from high school.  </P> <P> Lately, Laru has not slept well. She does not know when Jeff will call again or  what he decided to do. She has terrible dreams. She wakes up crying, soaked in  sweat, having dreamed that Jeff is lying dead on an airstrip in Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> "When I held him as an infant, I thought this was one baby who was not going to  be machine-gun fodder," Laru said. "This is terror. This is a mother's  nightmare."  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SYMPHONY PLANS CHANGES IN STYLE, NOT SUBSTANCE  </P> <P> In his opening season as the San Diego Symphony's music director, Yoav Talmi  promises several innovations in format, but a minimum of innovative music.  </P> <P> Talmi, who will conduct 10 of the 17 subscription programs on the orchestra's  1990-91 winter season, disclosed programming details Wednesday.  </P> <P> The season will include a new series of three chamber orchestra concerts in  Symphony Hall, called Classically Baroque; two programs that will lead to the  symphony's first recordings of classical repertory and a collaboration with the  Old Globe Theatre in a concert that will juxtapose excerpts from Shakespeare's  "Romeo and Juliet" with symphonic music by Berlioz, Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev  inspired by the play.  </P> <P> Talmi, who considers himself a Bruckner and Mahler specialist, will conduct  Bruckner's Seventh Symphony (Nov. 30-Dec.2) as well as Mahler's Second Symphony  "Resurrection" with the San Diego Master Chorale (April 5-7, 1991).  </P> <P> For the American Pro Arte label, the orchestra will record a pair of CD's. The  first will be a potpourri of J.S. Bach orchestral transcriptions (from the  concerts on Feb. 14 and 16, 1991), and the second will contain works from the  "Romeo and Juliet" collage (May 9 and 10, 1991).  </P> <P> Principal guest conductor Robert Shaw will lead three subscription programs,  including the Mozart "Great" Mass in C Minor with the Master Chorale (Jan.  10-13), the first offering of the orchestra's yearlong tribute celebrating the  bicentennial of Mozart's death. Talmi said nearly every subscription concert in  1991 will contain at least one Mozart work and will be preceded by a half-hour  program of Mozart's chamber music.  </P> <P> Shaw will carry the brunt of American music programming, with two programs in  March, 1991. The first will give the local premiere of John Harbison's  "Remembering Gatsby," a commission from the Atlanta Symphony first performed in  1986, and the second will be devoted to the music of Leonard Bernstein,  including his "Chichester Psalms."  </P> <P> The orchestra's 24-week schedule, expanded one week from the current season,  will include four classic silent films accompanied by organist Dennis James and  the orchestra, the popular Nickelodeon Series. Regular guest conductor Murry  Sidlin will return four times to narrate and conduct the Classical Hits Series.  </P> <P> The entertainment-oriented SuperPops Series has been renamed WinterPops; it  will feature the return of Peter Schickele as P.D.Q. Bach (Feb. 1-2) and two  other programs.  </P> <P> On Oct. 5, Talmi will inaugurate the season with a program that pairs Brahms'  First Symphony with Rachmaninoff's "Rhapsody on a Theme by Paganini," with  piano soloist Andre Watts.  </P> <P> Though Talmi has previously expressed his commitment to contemporary music, the  Israeli conductor has selected nothing more avant-garde than Samuel Barber's  1941 Violin Concerto, which will feature violinist Zina Schiff (Oct. 11-12). He  promised to compensate for this oversight in the 1991-92 season. Talmi's first  encounter with the Master Chorale will be in the Faure Requiem (Oct. 19-21).  </P> <P> Guest conductors include the return of German conductor Klauspeter Seibel (Oct.  25-27) and the local debut of Polish maestro Kazimierz Kord. The Warsaw  Philharmonic music director will lead Szymanowski's Nocturne from "Nocturne and  Tarantella" and Shostakovich's Sixth Symphony. Assistant conductor of the Los  Angeles Philharmonic Heiichiro Ohyama, who appeared with the symphony at last  year's Symphony Tower opening gala concert, will conduct the third chamber  orchestra program (Jan. 3).  </P> <P> Among the soloists who will appear with the orchestra next season are pianist  Jeffrey Kahane; cellist Lynn Harrell, who has been the orchestra's music  adviser for the past two seasons; pianist Jose Carlos Cocarelli, silver  medalist in the 1989 Van Cliburn Competition; prodigy Lelia Josefowicz, who  performed last year with the SummerPops, and symphony principal clarinet David  Peck.  </P></p>

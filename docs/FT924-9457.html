			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Ambulance service abandons computer THE LONDON Ambulance Service yesterday abandoned its new and troubled computerised despatch system and reverted to manual methods. Mr Martin Gorham, acting chief executive, said the computer would not be brought back into service until technical difficulties, which resulted in the system slowing down for no obvious cause, had been resolved. The ambulance service has been using manual back-up procedures to ensure an effective service since last week, when difficulties with the computer system caused delays that provoked claims that lives were being put at risk. Mr John Wilby, the ambulance service's chief executive, resigned last week. Yesterday the system slowed down when demand was low and back-up procedures failed to improve response times. The ambulance service said the despatch of one ambulance was delayed by 25 minutes. It arrived nine minutes later and the patient was safely transported to hospital. At that point it was decided to return to fully manual methods. The ambulance service said the system slowed at the same time as daily data was being automatically archived. The new system is built around a network of personal computers, in contrast to earlier systems based on minicomputers or mainframes.</p>

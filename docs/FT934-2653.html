			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / The Business Traveller: More leg room for your money - Gordon Cramb discovers that there is a bonus for some KLM business-class passengers Those with a long-haul flight ahead of them this winter, and an employer who is prepared to pay for a business-class ticket but no more, might wish to consider going Dutch. On KLM, you could land a first class-type seat for the journey, without forking out extra cash for the privilege. The Netherlands flag carrier last month abolished its unprofitable Royal Class. It is reconfiguring its fleet to add seats in the tourist cabin and move business class to the front of the air-craft. The process will take until March, and the airline has changed only one aircraft so far. On the rest, the former first-class cabin is untouched except for the menus. So for a club-level fare, business travellers who strike lucky can stretch out for a near-horizontal sleep. So how can you get one of these seats, rather than a more closely packed and steeply angled one in the regular business-class section? The best way is to request a seat allocation when booking, and ask about the configuration (as a rule, if it is an old-style interior, make sure the row number is in single figures). KLM is being a bit coy about this facility and its agents may need some prodding. One way to improve your chances, and to benefit for further flights besides, is to join the airline's frequent flyer programme. The scheme - inevitably, it is called Flying Dutchman - may grant priority in seat preference and is offering double its usual credits for business-class travellers through the winter season, equivalent to those previously accorded to Royal Class passengers. There is some inconvenience: the transit through Amsterdam's Schiphol airport can mean a long walk from gate to gate. You may be additionally hampered at the moment by building works. But you could score enough points for a free ticket back there, to stroll the city's canals another time.</p>

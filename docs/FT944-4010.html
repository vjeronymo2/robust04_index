			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / S African tax reforms seek to pull in evaders A government-appointed commission has called for a comprehensive revamping of South Africa's tax system, including reforms in tax collection, an increase in the top marginal rate of income tax to 45 per cent, and a one-off tax amnesty to try to draw in evaders. Unveiling the report in Johannesburg yesterday, Prof Michael Katz, commission chairman, said it aimed to set out a framework that would reduce the tax burden on the poor and middle classes while maintaining an investor-friendly environment to promote domestic investment and attract new foreign capital. However, Prof Katz stressed that the key to the proposed reforms' success was continued government commitment to reducing the budget deficit. 'Unless government spending is curbed, no tax system in South Africa will be adequate,' he said. Supporting the government's pragmatic line on fiscal policy, the wide-ranging document acknowledges that South Africa's big wealth disparities raise the temptation to try to alleviate the lot of the poor by reducing value added tax (VAT) on items such as foodstuffs and increasing corporate taxes and income taxes on the rich. But it warns that such moves would be counterproductive in the long run. Instead, it recommends that only the marginal rate on people earning more than R150,000 (Pounds 27,200) a year should be increased, while arguing that no new VAT exemptions should be made. It also proposes the abolition of the marketable securities tax and approves in principle the creation of tax-exempt export processing zones to facilitate foreign investment in the stock market and industry. The report also urges the revamping of the existing tax collection system, including making the Inland Revenue department autonomous, and significantly increasing staff numbers and improving training. To complement this it recommends a one-off amnesty for tax evaders, who include many blacks who have never registered as taxpayers, to help develop a culture of tax payment. Analysts largely welcomed the report, which they saw as a compromise between fiscal constraint and social responsibility. However, some labour representatives expressed disappointment that the commission had not recommended boosting VAT on luxury goods while reducing it on basic products. The report will be submitted to parliament for approval in early January, ahead of the budget which is due in March.</p>

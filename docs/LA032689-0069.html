			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAVELING OFF THE BEATEN PATH IN THE VIRGIN ISLANDS  </P> <P> For the visitor who treasures retreats off the beaten path, there are plenty  where the sky meets the sea in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  </P> <P> But don't expect such retreats to be listed by telephone number. You must learn  the secrets from someone who's been there. I have -- and I have secrets to  share.  </P> <P> The Kite is my favorite hangout on St. John. It's a clean roadside shack with a  tiny bar and a deck that hangs above a pair of turquoise bays and powder-white  beaches.  </P> <P> At the Kite a laid-back, personable St. Johnian named Victor Hall serves his  delicious version of the pina colada and strums a 12-string guitar to the  accompaniment of an electronic rhythm box as he sings.  </P> <P> Boats sail by while board sailors do their fancy stuff in Cinnamon Bay below.  And suddenly you're part of Hall's band, playing whatever you grab from behind  the bar -- from drums and congas to tambourines and maracas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hue of Fire  </P> <P> The sun sets in a hue of fire. As you look to the horizon you can see a chain  of emerald cays ringed with white sand set in an active passage between the  British Virgin Islands and the U.S. Virgins.  </P> <P> Although Hall opens the Kite when the mood strikes him, a great time to visit  is in the afternoon after a session on the beach.  </P> <P> The light-green shack that houses the Kite is on Northshore Road between  Cinnamon Bay and famous Trunk Bay in Virgin Islands National Park.  </P> <P> For great charcoal-grilled burgers, try Bryan's Bar on St. Thomas. Everything  is excellent. The menu is simple but the fish is fresh and the prices low.  </P> <P> You can dine at a picnic table under a mango tree with the light from the moon  to illuminate the moment. You can also chat at the bar with a French fisherman  or shoot a breezy game of pool on the veranda overlooking Hull Bay.  </P> <P> Bryan's Bar is off the beaten path on Hull Bay Road, not far from the beach by  the same name. To find it, consult a map. Dinner is served only from 6 to 10  p.m. After 10 p.m., only sandwiches.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Steel-Band Music  </P> <P> Should you happen into Long Bay on St. Thomas, don't be surprised to hear the  sweet pang of steel pans. Follow the sound to Vitraco Park and you'll come  across the popular Rising Stars Steel Orchestra.  </P> <P> Made up of more than 100 young people, the Rising Stars create a smorgasbord of  music. You may hear the steel-band versions of pop hits and classical  symphonies, as well as calypso. Return in April for the Virgin Islands carnival  and you'll hear the Rising Stars at their best, in and around the streets of  Charlotte Amalie.  </P> <P> If you're a jazz lover, check out the nautically-appointed, air-conditioned  tavern called Sparky's Waterfront Saloon. Although it has been around for long  time, changing hands and names, Sparky's has always managed to attract a crowd  of both residents and tourists. The food hits the spot and the bar is a good  place to meet islanders after work.  </P> <P> You might even run into Grammy nominee (for "Lady Love" and "Rashida") Jon  Lucien, a native of St. Thomas, who might just show up to play a set or two.  </P> <P> Sparky's is at the waterfront in downtown Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Quiet Corner  </P> <P> For those in search of a quiet corner, the Seaside Inn will prove a find. Its  character is West Indian. Its decor is rustic and colorful, and its clientele  99.9% native.  </P> <P> The best thing about Seaside is that you can select a fish -- a plump trigger  fish, local lobster, conch or whelk -- from a bucket containing the day's  catch. Ask for it broiled, smothered with creole-style gravy and served with  plantain, rice and boiled sweet potato.  </P> <P> The Seaside is on Estate Frydenhoj on the lagoon between Virgin Islands  Pleasure Boats and La Vida Marina on the way to Red Hook. It is open evenings.  If you're in the area, stop in early to check out what's cooking for that  night's dinner.  </P> <P> For calypso and reggae, try Hillside Club. Dance to island melodies played by  Sammy Watts and his combo. A St. Thomas native, Watts has played with soul  great Isaac Hayes. Join him for happy hour while viewing the harbor.  </P> <P> On Wednesday nights the Hillside Club offers a West Indian show including  limbo, dancing on broken bottles and fire eating. The club is crowded on  weekends, which makes it an ideal time to mingle with locals.  </P> <P> Hillside is on St. Thomas on Mafolie Road on the way to Magens Bay from town.  It's open every night except Monday, from 10 p.m. to 1:30 a.m., Fridays and  Saturdays from 10:30 p.m. to 3:30 a.m.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> Looking for accommodations on St. Thomas?

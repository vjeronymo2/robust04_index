			<p>BFN     [Text] On the morning of 26 May, Yue Qifeng, secretary of  the provincial party committee, visited a certain combined arms  army of the provincial military district stationed in Harbin and  the officers and men of a certain army institute in Harbin. He  encourages cadres and soldiers to emancipate their minds, study  the major tactics well, and make contributions to Heilongjiang's  social stability and economic development.    Acting Governor Tian Fengshan, Shan Rongfan, deputy  secretary  of the provincial party committee, and Wang Xinmin, secretary  general of the provincial party committee, participated in the  visiting activities.    At the institute of a certain army unit stationed in Harbin,  Yue Qifeng carefully listened to briefings and asked in detail  about the training and living of officers and men. Yue Qifeng  said: Economic development can never be separated from the army,  and a modernized army must also rely on economic development.  He called on the institute to train more qualified personnel  and to exert efforts to and offer plans for strengthening the  national defense force and developing the local economy.    At a certain combined arms army stationed in Harbin, Yue  Qifeng highly affirmed the contributions to local development  and stability of the new generation of officers and men  defending the border areas and expressed hope that the local  people and the army will jointly emancipate the mind, help each  other, and invigorate Heilongjiang.    Yue Qifeng said to the leading comrades of the provincial  military district: It is necessary to organize the militia to  actively develop the processing, aquaculture, and [words  indistinct] industries. On hearing that militia have  contributed to township enterprises, he expressed appreciation  and pointed out: All cadres and soldiers should be organized to  study professional knowledge. We have a good prospect for  training dual-purpose personnel and making them play a part in  the main economic battlefield.    Yue Qifeng, secretary of the provincial party committee,  emphatically pointed out: The key to accelerating economic  development is to emancipate the mind and change concepts. Once  the concepts are changed, tremendous potentials will be seen.  Those who rapidly change their concepts will gain the  initiative. Heilongjiang is quite strong in natural resources,  trained personnel, science and technology, and the quality of  the masses. As long as it breaks away from the planned economy  on its own initiative and rapidly enters the market economy, it  will achieve great development.</p>

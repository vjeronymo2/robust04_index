			<p>BFN     [Text] The Georgian parliament held a session today which  discussed the country's budget. The parliamentary opposition  gave a sharply negative assessment of the draft budget and took  the opportunity to raise the issue of authority, demanding that  the head of state be stripped of his special powers.    The session also heard a statement from the parliamentary  majority, which condemns the activity of opposition deputies who  are trying to create an obstructive atmosphere in the country's  supreme legislative body and introduce it into the republic's  sociopolitical life in general. The statement stresses that  attempts by the opposition to impose on deputies a debate on the  issue of authority, especially the issue of stripping the head  of state of his special powers, is aimed at sowing  destabilization in the country. The statement says that the  issue of authority is addressed by the draft of the republic's  new constitution and will be debated before the constitution is  adopted.</p>

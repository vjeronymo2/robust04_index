			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Adalbert Rebic, head of the Office for </F> Refugees and Displaced Persons of the Government of the Republic  of Croatia, by Lidija Krslak; place and date not given: "Open  the Gate of Free Bosnia"]    [Text] Since the beginning of the aggression against  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the arrival of the first wave of refugees  in Croatia, the information on the number of refugees provided  by Bosnia-Herzegovina differed from that provided by Croatia  more often than not.    [Krslak] Although the new registering of refugees is yet to  take place, how many are there in the Republic of Croatia  according to the data you have? How many are in private  accommodation and how many in organized accommodation, and what  is the ethnic composition?    [Rebic] Since the beginning of the aggression against  Bosnia-Herzegovina, hundreds of thousands of Bosnia-Herzegovina  refugees have passed through Croatia, of which 250,000 are still  in Croatia. The first refugees were from Herzegovinian towns and  villages, as the JNA [Yugoslav National Army] violently attacked  Herzegovina first. However, when Herzegovina was liberated from  the Serbian JNA and the paramilitary formations, the  Herzegovinian refugees immediately returned to their homes in  the liberated towns and villages of western Herzegovina and the  Neretva River basin. Immediately after the aggression against  Herzegovina, the Serb formations attacked all the areas of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and in early April 1992, some 1,000 refugees  per day who entered Croatia. The greatest number of refugees  arrived during the summer of 1992, from the Banja Luka area,  from Bosanska Krajina, Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zenica, and Bosanska  Posavina. In June 1992, there were 280,000 refugees in Croatia.  We then held an international conference in Zagreb (on 9 June)  and asked for urgent aid in food and accommodation capacities.  We were setting up tents, because all the facilities were  already occupied. During July and August, Germany, Switzerland,  and the Netherlands took 17,000 refugees to relieve the refugee  situation in Croatia. In the late fall of 1992, there were  about 370,000 refugees in Croatia. We were building refugee  camps and restoring the former army barracks and other  facilities. We still had refugees living in tents, whom we only  managed to accommodate in November. Many were leaving for third  countries, especially in Europe. In April 1993, we made a list  of all the refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina, and established  that there were exactly 269,005 in Croatia in that month. We  keep the names and other necessary information in the database  that has been used by other local and foreign institutions that  needed the exact number of refugees in order to provide better  care. No one else was able to state data other than what we  collected through the registration, which we keep in the  database.    The greatest number of refugees after this registration was  in February this year: 331,000 refugees. Since then, the  number of refugees has been decreasing gradually: some have  returned to Bosnia-Herzegovina, and some are still going to  third countries. On 25 May this year, we had 267,516 refugees,  of which there are 238,516 registered and some 28,000  non-registered (this is our estimate). Some 67,000 refugees  stay in organized accommodation, for which we pay 750 kunas (200  German marks [DM]) per person per month on average, and 180,000  refugees live in families or independently, for whom we pay 100  kunas (DM25) per person per month to the people who provide  homes for them. We also provide food for the latter.    We allow for the possibility that among the registered there  may be some who, in the meantime, went to third countries or  returned to Bosnia-Herzegovina without having deregistered. We  are therefore going to carry out another registration of the  refugees so that we will again have the correct information on  the number of refugees that will prove trustworthy both to our  public and the international public. Croatia is one of the few  countries that carries out these registration procedures and has  accurate data regarding the number of refugees and displaced  persons.    As far as the ethnic composition is concerned, about 55  percent are Bosnians of Islamic faith, and some 45 percent are  Catholics, that is, Croats. However, this new registration will  show the exact ratio.    [Krslak] The fact is that the number of refugees was often  used as the "trump card" in the political negotiations, even in  economic agreements. The manager of a certain bank has  "procured" an arrangement with Kuwait, having given the figure  of 70,000 Muslims in Croatia. What is your comment on such  manipulations of the refugees?    [Rebic] As far as using the number of refugees in  political talks or economic agreements is concerned, I cannot  tell you anything, as I have no such information. Numbers of  refugees and displaced persons are certainly mentioned in all  the political talks; it is inevitable. After all, they are  persons who are the greatest victims of the Serb aggression, of  the war against Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. They should be  given proper accommodation and enabled to return to their homes.  In that context, politics can help a great deal. I do not know  of any "procured" arrangement of "a certain" bank with Kuwait.  Since the name of the bank, the place, the manager's name, the  time of "procuring," and other information has not been stated,  I consider it to be simply a rumor. You can be sure that Kuwait  would have asked me about the number of refugees before entering  such "procurement." In our experience, the Arabic and Islamic  humanitarian organizations were, in general, very cautious about  giving humanitarian aid, and they were mainly giving it for the  Muslims. Therefore, there have been no manipulations with the  refugees. On the contrary, many Croatian banks, companies, and  humanitarian organizations were very generous with humanitarian  aid and money for the refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina, not  asking about their ethnic or religious orientation. Croatia has  been the greatest benefactor to the Bosnia-Herzegovina refugees.    [Krslak] Regarding the expected return of the refugees from  Croatia to their homeland, to the liberated areas, you have  pointed out many times that Croatia cannot bear such refugee  pressure. In Sarajevo you asked that the refugee problem be  first resolved in Croatia. What suggestions do you have related  to this?    [Rebic] Regarding the expected return of the refugees to  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which the Bosnia-Herzegovina authorities  have been insisting on, we will sign an agreement on the  organized and safe return of all the refugees to  Bosnia-Herzegovina with the authorities of the Federation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. We want the return of the refugees from  Croatia to Bosnia-Herzegovina to be implemented soon in all the  safe areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as has been the case with the  displaced persons in Croatia. We arranged that in principle  while we were in Sarajevo; the specific modes will be agreed  upon in the agreement and protocol on our return. Croatia is  still overburdened by refugees. It has the greatest number of  refugees, that is, more than Germany. I believe that there are  no more than 200,000 refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina in Germany  -- I do not want to discuss how many there are from the  territory of the former Yugoslavia!    [Krslak] You have recently stated that the return of the  refugees to Bosnia-Herzegovina would be implemented sooner than  the return of the displaced persons to the occupied territories  in Croatia. What is your estimate based on, and what plans for  the return to Bosnia-Herzegovina do you suggest, having met with  the Bosnia-Herzegovina authorities in Sarajevo, and with Mr.  Izetbegovic?    [Rebic] I said that the return of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  refugees to Bosnia-Herzegovina would be implemented before the  return of our displaced persons to the occupied areas, or the  UNPA's [UN Protected Areas] and pink zones; namely, the return  of the Bosnia-Herzegovina refugees to the free part of  Bosnia-Herzegovina is already possible. Naturally, there is  still the unresolved issue of the refugees from the areas of  Bosnia-Herzegovina that have been occupied by the Serb Chetniks.  Their eventual return will depend on the return of the  displaced persons to the occupied territories of Croatia. I  believe that these two segments of the problem will have to be  solved together.    [Krslak] Will Croatia be able to offer the  Bosnia-Herzegovina refugees the freedom of the choice to stay,  as some other European countries (for instance, Sweden) have  done?    [Rebic] Croatia will certainly have to keep some refugees  eventually, as they will not want to return to Bosnia. Some  have already found jobs in Croatia and bought or exchanged  apartments or houses. It is inevitable that some refugees  always stay in the country that took them in. However, not too  many will stay in Croatia, because Bosnia-Herzegovina is close,  and because it is difficult to get a job in Croatia. There are  still some 260,000 unemployed in Croatia. This is a great  problem for the reintegration of the refugees. Croatia also has  240,000 displaced persons, some of whom will also not want to  return to their homes. As far as other countries are concerned,  some of them will certainly keep some of the refugees, as they  need workers. You can be sure that if they had as great a  number of unemployed (relatively) as Croatia does, they would  not even have let them into their country. At any rate, you  probably know that in France, England, and some other large  countries of Europe there are no more than 5,000 Bosnia-  Herzegovina refugees. Only Germany (180,000), Austria (40,000),  Switzerland (40,000), Slovenia (22,000), Norway (14,000), and  Denmark (15,000) took a larger number of Bosnia-Herzegovina  refugees.    [Krslak] Regarding the Bosnia-Herzegovina refugees, the most  topical problem are the refugees from central Bosnia, who are  accommodated in the Slovenian company vacation homes. Are there  any chances for this problem to be solved with a compromise  between the three interested parties (the owners, your office,  and the refugees)?    [Rebic] The Bosnia-Herzegovina refugees who are accommodated  in the Slovenian company vacation homes will move to other  refugee centers immediately after school is over.</p>

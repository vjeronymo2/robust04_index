The military court of Sidi Barrani, near the Libyan border,  passed the death sentence against a second lieutenant in the  reserves, Midhat Tahawi, and two conscripts, Hamadah Muhammad  Lutfi and Muhammad Ahmad Sa'id Salih, on Wednesday.    One of the conscripts was among the seven Islamic militants  killed in a police raid on the Cairo district of al-Zawiyah al-  Hamra' in early February, according to an informed source. The  other two appeared in court.    Another second lieutenant, Fathi Mahmud Khattab, and two  more  conscripts were each sentenced to 10 years of hard labour.    The court said the six soldiers had planted explosives at  Sidi Barrani airport and planned to detonate the bomb during a  visit by Mubarak, who often meets his Libyan counterpart  Mu'ammar al- Qadhdhafi in the border town.    The trial opened on January 30 behind closed doors.    The latest verdicts raised to 43 the number of Islamic  militants sent to death row since October 1992. Twenty-nine  people have been executed over the last nine months.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Builders 'forced to bid 10% below cost' CONSTRUCTION companies desperate to win work and generate cash are bidding prices on average 10 per cent below what jobs are expected to cost, Gardiner &amp; Theobald, the leading firm of quantity surveyors, said yesterday. Gardiner &amp; Theobald warned that customers which accepted unrealistic prices could suffer as contractors then sought to recover their costs as work progressed. Mr Tony Burton, a partner, said: 'Either contractors will go bust or they will have to find another way of squeezing cash out of the job. This could be achieved by trying to pass the pain on to subcontractors which themselves could fail; or, by pursuing legal claims for extra payments because of variations introduced to original designs which arise on almost every job. Either way it is unlikely to be good news for the customer.' Gardiner &amp; Theobald, which publishes price indices that are quarterly based on reports from more than 2,000 specialist contractors, warned that fixed-price jobs could come under pressure if building material prices rose because of sterling's devaluation or reduced capacity among domestic suppliers. The firm estimated that imported materials accounted for between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of the cost of a commercial development. It said: 'In theory the devaluation of the pound could add 4 per cent to 5 per cent to the cost of a project. It is unlikely, however, that the full effect will be passed on and there is evidence that overseas contractors are finding that they can no longer afford to tender in sterling in the UK market.' The recession had led to closures and mothballing of plants by building material suppliers and the erosion of over-capacity should see prices rise, they added. Mr Burton said: 'One cladding company recently reported that it had reduced its operations so much that if they were to win one more large project they would be at full capacity and therefore able to consider raising their prices. 'A steel contractor reported that his sector of the industry was at last getting the message that buying business is a fruitless exercise and that prices are tending to rise as a consequence.' Gardiner &amp; Theobald forecasts that tender prices would rise by 3 per cent this year after a fall of 1 per cent last year. It said that construction tenders had fallen by an average 30 per cent in real terms since 1989. Increases in the price of steel, glass and plasterboard have been announced by building material producers in the past month. Of these, the plasterboard increases, announced by BPB Industries, Europe's biggest producer, seem most likely to stick. Rises announced by British Steel and Pilkington are likely to face opposition from contractors which will seek alternative suppliers overseas.</p>

			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Leading Article: False moves in Malaysia Malaysia believes that by banning British bidders from government contracts it can teach the UK a political lesson. From the anguished reaction of several large British companies, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, may be tempted to conclude that the tactic has worked. However, his action is a two-edged sword. While it may cause Britain some temporary problems, it risks doing longer-lasting damage to Malaysia's international reputation and economic development. The ban was imposed not in response to any transgression by the British government in the Pergau dam controversy, but was explicitly intended to retaliate against reporting of the affair by the British press and, in particular, against allegations that bribes were offered to Malaysian politicians. This displays both extreme sensitivity to criticism and a refusal to acknowledge the way that democracy works in western countries. British law entitles newspapers to publish what they believe to be the truth. It also entitles those who believe they have been libelled to sue. If Dr Mahathir has a legitimate grievance, that is the course he should have taken. His failure to do so may reflect how far his government has grown used to a tame local press, kept in its place by strict controls. Such policies, common in much of Asia, are often defended on the grounds that they preserve 'Asian values' against undesirable western influences. In practice, they too often suit narrow government interests. By shielding governments from uncomfortable truths, they can encourage a myopic view of the world. Impressive strides This holds dangers for Malaysia, which aims to become fully industrialised by 2020. It is to Dr Mahathir's credit that it has made impressive strides towards that goal, replacing traditional dependence on exports of commodities with exports of manufactures, including electronics and cars. Its recent growth has averaged 8 per cent annually, and unemployment has been almost eradicated. These achievements have depended on access to developed markets and inward investment, much of them from western and Japanese multinational companies. Awareness of this dependence has prompted the government both to champion the virtues of multilateral trade, while criticising the US pursuit of unilateral policies towards Japan, and to liberalise its own economy. For Malaysia now to resort to the bilateralism it condemns in others is inconsistent. Fiercer competition It may also prove damaging. Multinational investment has been drawn to Malaysia primarily by its relatively low labour costs and recent political stability. However, the former advantage is being eroded by rising wage costs and fiercer competition for investment from countries such as China. In response, Malaysia is seeking to upgrade its economy by stressing more sophisticated activities, including information services. It can only succeed by attracting further investment from multinational companies. To judge by last year's sharp drop in inward investment, some may already be rethinking their commitment to its economy. The government's short-sighted behaviour last week will scarcely encourage them to locate commercially sensitive operations dependent on free information flows in Malaysia. That this action may rebound on Malaysia does not exonerate the British government's handling of the Pergau dam affair. The essential charge is one of hypocrisy. UK policy forbids the linking of development aid to weapons deals. Yet aid for the dam was at one stage tied to Pounds 1bn in arms sales. Even after ministers told Malaysia there could be no formal link, talks on both deals continued in parallel. The moral case for the UK's aid programme has been undermined, while export prospects have been damaged, in the end, rather than helped. Britain needs to establish a clearer separation between aid policies, which should be dedicated to fostering economic development in the world's poorest countries, and subsidies to UK exporters. This division needs to be reinforced by stronger and more transparent procedures. If ministers override rules, they should at least be required to explain why they have done so. For the UK, the essential lesson is that daylight is the best regulator. For Malaysia, it is that joining the club of industrialised countries requires more than a narrow focus on GNP growth. It also means tolerating, if not actually embracing, the constitutional freedoms which go with economic maturity. This is where Malaysia's true self-interest lies.</p>

			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECTER OF FAMINE IN ETHIOPIA  </P> <P> A famine as grave as that of 1985 is threatening 5 million Ethiopians,  prompting a global appeal for help from United Nations Secretary General Javier  Perez de Cuellar. There has been a quick response from the United States and  the European Community, but the effectiveness of the relief mission is clouded  by civil strife in that country and restrictions imposed by the Ethiopian  government.  </P> <P> Food supplies in the northern provinces will be exhausted in the first months  of the new year, according to an assessment by the U.N. Food and Agriculture  Organization. The impact of the drought has been made worse by the continuing  warfare being waged between government forces and guerrilla organizations in  both Tigre, where the drought is worst, and Eritrea.  </P> <P> Ethiopian officials have approved a flow of aid to rebel-controlled territory  but only through the Joint Relief Program, a consortium of Ethiopian relief  groups. This will facilitate the flow of American aid which is sent through  Catholic Relief Services, an agency working closely with the joint program. But  thus far the Ethiopian government has not approved the flow of aid from the  International Committee of the Red Cross and United Nations into the northern  provinces where the civil warfare is raging.  </P> <P> The initial American commitment of 165,000 metric tons of grains is about  one-fifth of the estimated total food aid needed for 1990. In addition, the  United States is providing food assistance to three other African food crisis  areas, Sudan, Mozambique and Angola, all three caught in devastating civil  strife.  </P> <P> Deterioration of the food situation in Ethiopia comes at a time when developing  nations throughout the world are falling behind in food production. This year,  cereal production in the nations of Africa, Asia and Latin America increased  only 1%, substantially less than population growth.  </P></p>

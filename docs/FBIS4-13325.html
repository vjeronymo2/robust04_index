			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Shaykh Abd el-Baki Saharawi, </F> founder of the FIS, by Nicolas Beau in Paris; date not given:  "Algeria's Rulers Will Fall Like Ripened Fruit"]    [Text] Shaykh Saharawi is one of the few dignitaries who  can speak on behalf of the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS], of  which he is a founding member. From the Myrha Street Mosque in  Paris, he describes the battle plans of "those on the inside"  and the FIS' government program.    In the heart of the 18th district, a very Arab and  African-looking Parisian area, the Myrha Street Mosque, a  warehouse undergoing renovations, is the latest retreat of  Shaykh (master) Abd el-Baki Saharawi. A founder of the FIS,  this 84-year old preaches every Friday in front of thousands of  faithful. Since the imprisonment of the FIS' principal leaders  Abbasi Madani and Ali Belhadj in Algeria in 1990, no one has  been really qualified to speak on behalf of the FIS. As  fundamentalist guerrillas control at least four Algerian regions  (Blida, Bouira, Chlef, Medea), they have their own legitimacy.  Outside Algeria, however, Saharawi is one of the few who have  been maintaining ties with "those on the inside." "I have been  in contact with the mujahidins (freedom fighters)," he simply  admits. Whenever he speaks about Chebouti, a member of the  Armed Islamic Movement (MIA) and main guerrilla leader, Shaykh  Saharawi call him "general Chebouti." "We have had thousands of  generals whose titles were illegitimate. Why should we not have  our own military ranking system?"    In Paris, people no longer understand the true nature of  Algeria's ruling group, which is split between the  "eradicationist" wing, which favors all-out repression, and the  moderate wing, which advocates dialogue. Shaykh Saharawi is  unimpressed by such fine distinctions: "Algeria's rulers went  one step toward democracy by holding elections. We won, but  they clung to power. It was this caricature of democracy that  triggered the crisis: The ruling class had become illegitimate."    Dialogue? What dialogue? Shaykh Saharawi smiles  self-righteously: "The Army must return to its barracks; it has  nothing to do with civilian life. The ruling group tells us:  `Leave oil, foreign affairs, and the armed forces to us.' But  such bartering is over, now, it is a thing of the past..." He  dismisses as irrelevant the three-year transitional period the  army has been attempting to negotiate with fundamentalist  leaders: "We give them three months, and that is it." Why  should they wait any longer? Fundamentalists are convinced that  they will be in power much sooner, possibly within a month:  "Mujahidins have already begun to converge in the Algiers area.  The rulers will fall like ripened fruit."    His face suddenly hardening, Shaykh Saharawi pulls out  pictures of fundamentalists who have been viciously tortured:  faces butchered with chain saws, limbs cut off. Algeria's  civil war is now a palpable presence in the quiet mosque. "We  will not let them have their way," he says curtly, adding: "You  did not understand me; all we ask the Army is to desist.  Soldiers have one single purpose: to defend the country..."  We insist. Is shared power an option? Could there be a  coalition grouping the Arab-Muslim bloc of the FLN [National  Liberation Front] and some members of the FFS (Socialist Forces  Front) led by Kabylia-born Hocine Ait Ahmed? "Why not?" says  Shaykh Saharawi. "But should the people give us an absolute  majority, then we shall not share power. When the Right wins in  France, it governs alone, and Socialism is swept away."    The French system is often mentioned by Shaykh Saharawi, who  was a sergeant in the 7th Regiment of Algerian infantrymen  during World War II, before becoming union representative in the  factory for FO [Workers' Force]. However, Western logic has had  no bearing on his political views: "For us, democracy is only a  means to an end, it is most definitely not a value." France has  disappointed him, its options are no longer credible. "It took  you four centuries to come up with democracy, and not a single  voice was heard condemning the interruption in the electoral  process." Not that fundamentalists want to extend their jihad  to French suburbs. "We do not intend to open a second front in  France. Before 1962, things were different, we were fighting  our colonizer. Today's events only affect Algerians."    Shaykh Saharawi's political platform is fairly specific:  "For us, most issues are already discussed and settled in the  Koran. That which God has decreed remains immutable." Sixty km  south of Algiers, in the fundamentalist-controlled Blida region,  no woman goes about unveiled. God's will? "Of course, wearing  the veil is a Koranic recommendation. Woman is unique for man,  she must be honored and respected. The prophet wrote this in  his Hadith (teachings)." Shaykh Saharawi was especially  appalled by recent television programs which allegedly advised  women to have sexual intercourse before marrying. "This is pure  depravation," says the cleric, adding that "all this cannot be  done overnight; there are no plans to impose Islamic law with  militiamen and pasdarans, as was the case in Iran. We must  re-islamize society little by little."    All parties will be accepted in this Islamic society,  provided they are not anti-Islamic. This is the sudden  admission that spreads doubt in the mind of the Western  listener. For instance, there is not much of a future for Said  Saadi's Kabyle party, the RCD (Rally for Culture and Democracy),  which has been given the most exposure by the French press  because it provides them with a secular (and deceiving) picture  of Algeria's society: "Obviously, the RCD will be banned, as it  does not represent anyone but itself." Shaykh Saharawi has no  mercy for Algerian intellectuals, who are a daily target of  terrorists, either: "These are bureaucrats tooting their own  horn; they condemn recent killings, but they did not say a word  against the military dictatorship which oppressed the people for  30 years."    Why does this tactful old man, who does not lack a sense of  humor, advocate a society that runs totally counter to our  beliefs? How can we understand one another? After all, he  unequivocally condemned the murders of foreigners, including  French nationals. But faced with such questions, Shaykh Saharawi  quickly puts an end to the discussion. "I am a Muslim; you in  Europe are atheists, laymen, it is only normal that we should  not understand one another; we must learn to respect one  another."    The whole fundamentalist platform is to be found in a  16-page  document written by FIS founders at their organization's  inception in 1989. Agriculture will be strongly promoted.  "Algeria used to be the granary of the Mediterranean; feeding  the people is a priority." Taxes will be replaced by zekat  (charity), which is more productive. The economy will be  liberal, except from a number of sectors which will remain  state-owned (oil, mining). Corruption will be hunted down  ruthlessly. Shaykh Saharawi insists: "Ruthlessly." Will they  go as far as cutting off a thief's hand, as provided for by the  Koran? "When everyone has enough to eat, and no earlier than  that, we may consider such a punishment."    What about the burden of Algeria's foreign debt? "When we  are in power, we shall see what we can afford to pay..." No  question of paying for the servicing of the debt, at any rate:  "We paid already at least four times what was owed; the notion  of interest is contrary to Islam's precepts." Economics is  visibly not Shaykh Saharawi's primary concern. The true program  of this simple and pious man is contained in the following  Koranic line, which he willingly translates: "God is  everlasting, ever-living, and he rules the world."</p>

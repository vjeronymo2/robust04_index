			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Maria Elena Gil] </F>   [Text] Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, 12 May (PL) -- Cuban  President Fidel Castro today concludes his brief visit to this  city, where he made a service stop on his way to Havana  following a trip to Barbados, Ghana, and South Africa.    Bahia Governor Antonio Embassagy welcomed Fidel Castro at  the  airport last night and hosted a dinner in Castro's honor.  Dinner guests included Ramon Sanchez Parodi, Cuba's ambassador  to Brazil; Former Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos De Magalhaes;  Prefect Lidice Damata; and the Cuban delegation.    Magalhaes and Damata hosted Castro during his visit in 1993,  when he attended the Third Ibero-American Summit.    Castro began his tour on 4 May in Barbados, where he  attended  the First World Conference on Sustainable Development of Small  Island States, which was attended by 16 other heads of state and  government.    From Barbados he traveled to South Africa to attend the  inauguration of President Nelson Mandela. On his way to  Pretoria, Castro made a stopover in Accra, the capital of Ghana,  where he met with President Jerry John Rawlings.    Many statesmen and the accredited press showered Castro with  attention in Pretoria and Bridgetown and asked him for private  interviews.    Shortly before leaving Pretoria, the Cuban and South African  foreign ministers reported that diplomatic relations were  established between the two countries.    Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina; National Assembly  President  Ricardo Alarcon; Rosa Elena Simeon, minister of environment,  science, and technology; and other officials accompanied Castro  on this trip.</p>

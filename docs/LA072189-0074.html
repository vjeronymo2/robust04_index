			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IOWA CRASH IS LATEST CRISIS FOR UNITED CHAIRMAN WOLF  </P> <P> Wednesday's tragic crash of a United DC-10 as it attempted an emergency landing  in Sioux City, Iowa, is the worst in a string of crises faced by Stephen M.  Wolf in his short stint as United's chairman and chief executive.  </P> <P> Wolf, who flew to the Iowa farming community Thursday to meet with government  investigators and comfort injured passengers and crew, has steered the nation's  second-largest airline through persistent takeover rumors and confrontations  with its pilots.  </P> <P> Regarded as an airline turnaround expert, Wolf joined United 19 months ago  after stints at Republic Airlines and Los Angeles-based Tiger International.  They were both troubled airlines when he arrived, but Wolf cleaned up Republic  and then Tiger in short order by streamlining route systems and winning  valuable wage concessions from employees.  </P> <P> He helped sell Republic to Northwest Airlines in 1986 and paved the way for  Tiger's sale to Federal Express earlier this year.  </P> <P> The disastrous crash at Sioux City's small airport, which killed more than 100  people, is the latest challenge for Wolf, a no-nonsense executive known for his  trademark red suspenders. He evokes strong feelings from his employees.  </P> <P> "I kind of admire the guy and am angry at him for sometimes being a jerk," said  Rick Maguire, chairman of Flying Tiger Line's pilot group. Maguire credited  Wolf with turning around the airline, which had been losing $76,000 a day when  Wolf arrived, but said pilots still resent the steep paycuts they accepted  under pressure from Wolf.  </P> <P> Those who have worked with Wolf describe him as a benevolent dictator, one who  is not afraid to show leadership. On Thursday, he took a 6 a.m. chartered  flight to the Iowa crash site and later met with Flight 232's crew at their  hospital bedsides. In a statement, Wolf expressed admiration for the crew and  pledged United's support for the families of those who died.  </P> <P> It is not known what impact the Iowa disaster will have on United.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Alternating Engine Speed  </P> <P> Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board have focused their  attention on the aircraft's rear General Electric engine. A source close to the  investigation said it is believed that the rear engine exploded and debris from  the blowout severed the airliner's hydraulic lines, making it impossible to  steer.  </P> <P> The crew, according to a source close to the investigation, remarkably guided  the plane toward the runway by alternating the speeds of the right and left  engines, in much the same way an oar is shifted from side-to-side to paddle a  canoe.  </P> <P> When Wolf, 48, arrived at United in December, 1987, the airline was in turmoil.  The airline's previous chairman had resigned under pressure from its militant  pilots group and from Coniston Partners, a New York investment firm that  threatened to seize control.  </P> <P> United's board had already started to trim the company back from a travel  conglomerate to simply an airline. Wolf quickly helped dispose of the Westin  Hotel chain and half of the airline's Covia reservation system, raising nearly  $2 billion. Impatient investors received $2.8 billion in a massive stock  buyback program.  </P> <P> Wolf worked fast to reduce costs and streamline the airline's route system.  Unpopular flights, such as a 5:45 a.m. trip from Cleveland to Buffalo, were  dropped. A program of offering television sets and fur coats to employees as  rewards for cost-saving suggestions brought results: One suggestion to cut  radishes out of salads on some flights saved $9,600 a year.  </P> <P> Wolf has also taken steps to expand and modernize United's fleet, among the  industry's oldest. The airline has recently placed orders and options for more  than $18 billion worth of aircraft to replace aging domestic aircraft and to  beef up the airline's already powerful position in the Pacific travel market.  </P> <P> And earlier this week, Wolf said United plans to start flying to seven cities  in Europe in the next two years, in an effort to transform once-sleepy United  into a huge global airline.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gaining on Competition  </P> <P> Airline industry analysts praise Wolf's accomplishments at United, which is  starting to slowly regain domestic markets it lost to American Airlines and  Delta Air Lines -- its chief competitors -- during the early 1980s.  </P> <P> "He took an airline that really had not been focused for some time in terms of  growth and very quickly repositioned it," said Hans Plickert, an airline  industry analyst with the Transportation Group in New York. "United has become  very aggressive in the airline business. There is a hustle and bustle about  United that has not been there for years."  </P> <P> But Wolf has suffered a number of setbacks, most notably his failure to reach  agreement with the airline's pilots. There has been no agreement in 14 months  of contract talks between the pilots union and management. Because there is no  agreement, the pilots have refused to fly a new Boeing 747-400 delivered to  United late last month. The pilots union is said to be displeased with the new  aircraft because it takes only two people to fly it. Most of United's airliners  have three-man crews.  </P> <P> In another sign of their displeasure, the pilots union said two weeks ago that  it may revive its bid to acquire the airline and oust Wolf. Such takeover talk  has pushed up the price of United's shares $11 in the last two weeks. United  closed on Thursday at $172, down $1.50.  </P> <P> United is thought to be ripe for a takeover because of its valuable Pacific  route system, labor unrest, its extensive fleet and enormous cash flow. United  owns 80% of its planes, which have a market value of $3.6 billion. That, and  the $1 billion cash that United's operations generate, could be used by a  raider to finance a takeover. Wall Street analysts have estimated that United  may be worth as much as $270 a share.  </P> <P> Besides takeover threats, Wolf has had to deal with an earlier airline tragedy.  In February, a cargo door popped open and tore a gaping hole in the side of a  Boeing 747 as it cruised 22,000 feet over the Pacific near Hawaii. Nine people  were killed.  </P> <P> Investigators are still investigating the cause of that accident, but the  inquiry turned up a flaw in United's inspection procedures. Due to what a  United executive described as a "clerical error," the airline failed to pass on  a portion of a Federal Aviation Administration safety directive to its  maintenance crews. The missing paragraph warned crews to inspect cargo doors  for damage when they are closed manually.  </P></p>

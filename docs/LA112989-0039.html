			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARRISH, NOW A FREE AGENT, EXPECTED TO KEEP HALO  </P> <P> Although Angel catcher Lance Parrish was declared a free agent Tuesday by an  arbitrator's ruling and has until Jan. 8 to negotiate with all clubs, it's  unlikely that the 33-year-old veteran of more than 12 major league seasons will  wear a different uniform in 1990.  </P> <P> Parrish's agent, Tom Reich, indicated that Parrish is eager to remain with the  Angels, and General Manager Mike Port seems equally eager to keep Parrish.  </P> <P> Reich said he plans to meet with Port later this week or next week during the  annual winter baseball meetings in Nashville, Tenn. Port said in a statement  issued by the club that "processes are already under way" to ensure that  Parrish is retained.  </P> <P> "We're taking whatever steps are necessary to keep Lance Parrish as a  California Angel," a club spokesman said.  </P> <P> Parrish, who graduated from Walnut High School and lives in Yorba Linda, could  not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of mutual admiration between Lance Parrish and the club," Reich  said. "Let's say one thing: It was a real good year for Lance and the club and  his family. All things being relatively equal, he appeared to be happy. This is  his home. Those are important elements. Fair treatment is certainly another  important element."  </P> <P> The Angels acquired Parrish from Philadelphia on Oct. 3, 1988, for pitcher  David Holdridge and paid him $1.21 million in 1989, including bonuses totaling  $210,000. He hit .238 last season -- 23 points higher than his 1988 average --  with 17 home runs and 50 runs batted in.  </P> <P> Parrish was part of baseball's second collusion case, which resulted in  arbitrator George Nicolau's granting several players free agency after the 1988  season. Parrish, however, was not granted free agency at that time.  Management's Players Relations Committee claimed that he had waived his rights  to free agency when he left Detroit to sign with Philadelphia between the 1986  and '87 seasons.  </P> <P> A hearing before Nicolau on Parrish's right to free agency was scheduled for  next month but was canceled when the PRC agreed not to contest it. Nicolau then  issued his order Tuesday.  </P> <P> "It was pretty straightforward," Nicolau said of his ruling. "Something like 12  players (received a similar verdict) last year. . . . It's nothing unusual.  It's the same kind of . . . order given in prior cases and that I gave last  year."  </P></p>

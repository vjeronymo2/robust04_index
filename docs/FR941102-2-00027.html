The projects are located on the Deerfield River, in Windham and Bennington Counties, Vermont, and Franklin and Berkshire Counties, Massachusetts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FERC staff has determined that licensing these projects would constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the staff intends to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on the hydroelectric projects in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act. The staff's EIS will objectively consider both site specific and cumulative environmental effects of the projects and reasonable alternatives, and will include an economic, financial and engineering analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS will be analyzed by the staff and considered in a final EIS. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final licensing decisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scoping Meetings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FERC staff will conduct three scoping meetings. The two evening scoping meetings, one each in Massachusetts and Vermont, are primarily for public input while the day-time meeting will focus on resource agency and non-governmental organization (NGO) concerns. All interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend and assist the staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To help focus discussions, a preliminary scoping document outlining subject areas to be addressed at the meeting will be distributed by mail to interested parties on the FERC mailing list. Copies of the preliminary scoping document will also be available at the scoping meetings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The times and locations of the scoping meetings are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Massachusetts Public Scoping Meeting <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Tuesday, November 15, 1994, 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., Mohawk Trail Regional High School, Buckland, Massachusetts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Vermont Public Scoping Meeting <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Wednesday, November 16, 1994, 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., Wilmington High School, Wilmington, Vermont <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Agency Scoping Meeting <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Thursday, November 17, 1994, 9:00 a.m. to 12 noon, New England Power Company, Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Objectives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the scoping meetings, the staff will: (1) Summarize the environmental issues tentatively identified for analysis in the planned EIS; (2) solicit from the meeting participants all available information, especially quantifiable data, on the resources at issue, (3) encourage statements from experts and the public on issues that should be analyzed in the EIS, including viewpoints in opposition to, or in support of, the staff's preliminary views, (4) determine the relative depth of analysis for issues to be addressed in the EIS, and (5) identify resource issues that are not important and do not require detailed analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The meetings will be recorded by a stenographer and will become part of the formal record of the Commission proceeding on the Deerfield River projects under consideration.

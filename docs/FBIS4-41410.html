			<p>BFN     [Text] At today's meeting of the cabinet, Oleg Soskovets,  Russian first deputy prime minister, voiced his dissatisfaction  with the Ministry of Fuel and Power Engineering's position while  discussing the issue of how enterprises and organizations were  preparing for the fall and winter period. According to him, the  panic-stricken pronouncements by the ministry's representative  to the effect that we will not survive this winter can mean only  one thing: Such people should be found who will be able to  organize work in a new way.</p>

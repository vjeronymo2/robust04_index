			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> LINCOLN SCHOOL COULD BE REOPENED  </P> <P> The Newport-Mesa Unified School Board, faced with growing enrollment at the  elementary-school level, may decide as early as next week on the reopening of  Lincoln School as an elementary school.  </P> <P> The board is considering two options, according to Carol Berg, assistant  superintendent. The first calls for Lincoln to be reopened for all the fourth-  through sixth-graders within its zone. Under the plan, grades kindergarten  through third would be housed at Andersen Elementary, Harbor View and Eastbluff  schools.  </P> <P> The second option calls for Lincoln to be a kindergarten-through-sixth-grade  school, with Andersen and Harbor View offering the same grades. A third school  would be constructed in the San Joaquin Hills area. Eastbluff, currently a  kindergarten center for the entire zone, would be closed, Berg said.  </P> <P> The board will consider the matter at its meeting next Tuesday, and parents of  both Harbor View and Andersen students are invited to an informational meeting  at 7 p.m. next Monday at the Phase 1 Harbor View Homes Clubhouse on Port  Westbourne Place.  </P> <P> Parents have formed an ad hoc committee to work with the board on the decision,  which would not take effect until the 1992-1993 school year.  </P> <P> Some committee members say they are frustrated by what they call the lack of  information provided by the board on the first alternative, adding that they  believe that the needs of the children would be better served under the second  plan, according to committee spokeswoman Candi Grant.  </P> <P> "The idea that your kindergarten teacher watches you grow through the time that  you're in sixth grade . . . provides stability and security in a world that is  changing so rapidly and putting so much pressure on kids," Grant said.  </P> <P> But Berg said unifying fourth-through-sixth-graders in one central location  offers some advantages.  </P> <P> "The major plus for a K-3, four to six configuration is space," Berg said. "And  that the one school site (Lincoln) has some amenities . . . like a science  room, a gymnasium, that could be shared by all the students in the zone." LAURA  MICHAELIS  </P></p>

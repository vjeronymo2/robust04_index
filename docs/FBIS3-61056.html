Vodopyanov: "Russia Needs a Worthy Fleet"]    [Text] During the course of preparations for  celebrating the 300th anniversary of the Russian Fleet, besides  pride in its glorious centuries-old history, military seamen are  also experiencing well-founded concern for the future of the  Russian Navy. People devoted to the sea are bitter about the  fact that for the first time in many decades, not a single ship  was laid down at Russia's shipyards last year, and completion of  those under construction was suspended or is being done at an  extremely slow pace against the background of the massive  decommissioning of ships and vessels, both obsolete ones and  ones that could be preserved with the proper repair and  modernization. What is the reason for this situation--is it  merely economic difficulties, or is it an aggregate of other  reasons? It is with this question that we began our interview  with Andrey Afanasyevich Kokoshin, first deputy minister of  defense of the Russian Federation.    [Kokoshin] The difficult situation of the Russian Navy is  explained not only by the difficulties of the present situation  in Russia and the political and economic consequences of the  breakup of the USSR, but also by the past mistakes in  organizational development of the Navy, when warships were being  created, and basing and ground support and servicing systems,  that is, all that we call infrastructure, were not properly  developed. The same can be said about fleet armament, as well as  reconnaissance and target designation assets. There is another  aspect. Ships, even after being adopted into operational  service, took a very long time to complete and, naturally, could  not fully accomplish combat missions. What is more, today at the  Baltic Shipyards the guided-missile cruiser Peter the Great is  being completed. Only now is this ship, the fourth of this  project, getting all the weapons that were to be on the first  one. Huge delays in creating assemblies, individual components,  and weapons systems of the warships also have an effect. So, the  Navy is a victim both of the most difficult crisis situation of  our economy and, simultaneously, of those problems of  shipbuilding that built up over several decades.    [Vodopyanov] Apparently, we can also include here the  difficult situation with housing and other problems of social  security which have taken shape in the fleets?    [Kokoshin] Unquestionably. The trouble is that we created  ships, including outstanding ones, but essentially forgot about  people. This concerns not only officer personnel but also  enlisted personnel. It seems that the large number of incidents  in the Navy, including cases of suicide, are associated with the  fact that crews are located in the secluded space of ship  compartments for too long a time, and the conditions have not  been created for them for real rest and relaxation on shore.    [Vodopyanov] Andrey Afanasyevich, if the conversation turns  to development of the Navy's infrastructure, a logical question  arises: What is being done today to solve the problems you  mentioned?    [Kokoshin] Development of a system of basing and life  support  is a long-term program which must be planned for 15-20 years. In  doing so, we must proceed from the fact that the idea of  dispersing the infrastructure facilities for basing ship  groupings intended to operate in one or several closely located  operational areas is outdated. You see, a massive strike, not  even nuclear but conventional, but with high-precision weapons,  will destroy practically all the facilities no matter how we try  to move them apart. Therefore, I consider justified the  viewpoint of those experts who propose to position the fleets at  several bases unified in technology of supporting the vital  activities of the ships, weapons, and use of forces and weapons  at sea. Such a concentration of forces give a tremendous  advantage both for the development of the Navy's infrastructure  and for creating normal living conditions for servicemen and  their families.    [Vodopyanov] In doing so, obviously, we must proceed from  the  real conditions and capabilities of our state?    [Kokoshin] Undoubtedly. Unfortunately, we are just now  beginning to really count our money, to say nothing of the  Americans, Germans, and British. They will not invest their  money unless they are convinced that every dollar, mark, or  pound will provide the maximum return. In Russia's history, the  great Prince Konstantin Nikolayevich--general-admiral of the  Russian Fleet--and his fellow reformers devoted much attention  during the reform period to what is now called "cost  effectiveness." Today, every commander must become an economist.  The general customer of the Navy's arms in the person of  commanders of higher echelons, headquarters, and other command  and control bodies must be able to analyze what is more  beneficial to the Navy: For example, purchase five new  destroyers or modernize 10 that are in service. Lay a new  nuclear-powered submarine or modernize that which has proven  itself well. Order a new cruiser or invest money in development  of the infrastructure and life support of existing ships...    Of course, to do this, we in the armed forces must have  strong economic services, and one of our most important tasks is  to instill in commanders of all levels a taste for careful  analysis of the monetary resources which we possess and the  combat effectiveness of those arms which we purchase for this  money.    [Vodopyanov] To do this, however, commanders must clearly  know what the Russia's Ministry of Defense and you, as first  deputy minister of defense, see as the Navy's role today. What  is its concept of organizational development? It is no secret  that in Russia's past and, the impression is forming, the  present military doctrine, insufficient attention was and is  being devoted to the Navy.    [Kokoshin] There always was a double attitude towards the  Navy. On the one hand, it was loved in a special way. And  Russians, I would say, have a certain subconscious craving for  the sea. It is no wonder that the periods of Russia's isolation  concluded with departure for the seas that wash the present-day  Russia, initially in the west and south (Baltic, Black, and  Caspian seas) and then in the east (Pacific Ocean). On the other  hand, due to our geostrategic position, we have traditionally  been more of a land power than a sea power, and Russia's  military fate was usually determined on land. Of course, there  were critical moments and sea battles, such as Tsushima, which  also determined the future foreign policy and the domestic  situation of the Russian state. Nevertheless, the outcome of  wars--the Patriotic War of 1812, World War I and II--were  predetermined deep in Russian territory. This happened not only  due to Russia's natural geographic position but also, it seems  to me, due to the ambivalent attitude towards the Navy. It  experienced periods of a great upsurge and deep crises. And such  alternation was repeated over and over in Russia's history--we  must not forget this. Remember that after Peter the Great, the  Navy was very quickly brought to a deep decline by his  successors. Then things were corrected somewhat under Elizabeth  Petrovna, but it still cannot be said that the Navy was in a  magnificent position. During the rule of Catherine the Great,  the Navy flourished. It was during this period that the entire  world heard the names Senyavin, Greyg, and Ushakov, whose glory  was comparable to that of Rumyantsev and Suvorov. Under Paul I  the Navy still held its place, but under Alexander I it again  ended up in a difficult situation and was not used very much.  Paradoxical as it may seem, the most hated name for seamen of  that time was the name of the naval minister, Marquis de  Traverse. However, he did not decide everything; he merely acted  as an instrument of the top. Although the role of personality in  the Navy was always great, its revival, at least of the Black  Sea Fleet, in the first half of the 19th century was associated  primarily with the name Admiral Lazarev. Later came the Crimean  War, when the Navy was powerless against the enemy's armored  steam-powered ships, and the Russian admirals, officers, and  sailors became heroes of the land defense of Sevastopol. We also  remember the already mentioned Tsushima and 1918, when a large  part of the Black Sea Fleet was actually sunk... Overall, the  Russian Navy had a majestic and sometimes tragic history, one  that was more complex than that of the armed forces as a whole.  In the recent past, at the turn of the 1960's, the Navy was  subjected to a severe blow when nearly new ships that were far  from exhausting their combat capabilities were scrapped.    [Vodopyanov] Andrey Afanasyevich, you absolutely justly  noted  that we must not forget history, including that of the Navy. Is  this taken into account in the new shipbuilding program?    [Kokoshin] I would not say that we have a new shipbuilding  program in the traditional sense. I think there should be a  program of developing arms as a whole, of which the Navy would  be a component. And this would include not only ships but also  shore-based missile systems, naval aviation, and naval  infantry... But the most important thing, I repeat, is to  improve the basing system and the repair system. It is precisely  such a program that we need--without a one-sided slant towards  shipbuilding. This is especially dictated by the situation,  resulting from the breakup of the Soviet Union, in the Black,  Baltic, and Caspian Seas. As far as ships are concerned, I  believe the idea of creating a relatively small number of  aircraft-carrying ships merits very close attention. Overall, we  need new inspiring ideas whose implementation can help us keep  what we have for years. The young people of the Navy will have  their say here...    [Vodopyanov] But in order to advance, as you say, "ideas,"  those young people of the Navy need to know what criteria will  determine the quantitative and qualitative composition of the  Navy.    [Kokoshin] Absolutely, Russia needs a powerful, modern navy  without quantitative excesses, but with high indicators of  combat and operational effectiveness; a navy which would blend  in with an integrated military doctrine. Today it is especially  important for all the armed services and combat arms to  coordinate precisely with one another. Now, of course, there is  no optimum in this sphere. As far as the missions to be carried  out by the Navy are concerned, I think they primarily associated  with safeguarding Russia's security in certain areas and zones  adjacent to its territory and ensuring, along with the Strategic  Missile Troops and strategic Long-Range Aviation, reliable  nuclear deterrence. One of the Navy's most important missions  will be to preserve according to specific parameters its oceanic  functions, above all, in the context of reconnaissance,  collecting data, and studying the hydrological situation. Among  the combat missions, the primary one is to maintain the  stability of strategic nuclear-powered submarines and create  such conditions of combat duty that would enable us in the event  of political crises and military operations to prevail in the  near-ocean zones most vulnerable for safeguarding Russia's  security and also in certain key areas of the world oceans.    [Vodopyanov] But what is the basis for carrying out what is  planned? After all, it seems to us that today much is  justifiably being said about the insufficient thought given to  the policy of conversion of the defense industry, which led to  the collapse of our military-industrial complex and its loss of  advanced positions.    [Kokoshin] It must be recognized that we really did not have  a conversion policy, although efforts were made to convert the  military-industrial complex to producing peacetime products. But  such a program should have been implemented over the course of  10-15 years and certainly on the condition of the stability of  state administration. The conversion program proposed within the  framework of the old system can only be considered a conversion  palliative. When weakened "civilian" plants "hooked onto"  enterprises of the military-industrial complex, it was able to  work only in the presence of a directive force. And, of course,  the conversion policy had to have powerful market stimuli and be  built into an overall strategy of reformation of the economy and  independent of directions from above.    [Vodopyanov] Andrey Afanasyevich, how can you now  characterize the condition of the industrial complex meeting the  needs of the Navy?    [Kokoshin] It is very difficult. Essentially, we are now  fighting for the survival of the armed forces, including the  Navy, and for the preservation of industry, if only in those  volumes which would ensure maintaining the Army and Navy at the  necessary combat readiness. This is an extremely difficult task.  The director corps of defense enterprises agrees when you say  that it is necessary to reduce military orders and the number of  plants. But as soon as it affects the directors directly, they  begin to take it back: They say, let us reduce others' orders,  but not mine. Incidentally, we were also forced to curtail many  developments to the limit and, figuratively speaking, will have  to cut to the quick.    For example, we determined Severodvinsk and the  Sevmashpredpriyatiye [Severodvinsk Machine Building Enterprise]  to be the center of nuclear-powered submarine building. Now all  orders will go only there. But we must bring to readiness those  submarines which we have in the Far East. Some are being  completed at Nizhniy Novgorod, and large surface ships at  Kaliningrad and St. Petersburg...    [Vodopyanov] Again, it turns out that it is the Navy that is  suffering the greatest damage of all the armed services?    [Kokoshin] This is taking place due to its specific nature:  The duration of the shipbuilding cycle, the fact that they are  entire floating cities which combine much of what the Air Force,  Missile Troops, and Air Defense Troops have... Therefore, such  super powerful weapons systems are now suffering the most. The  specific nature of today's industrial production and the fact  that there are no strict rules governing behavior of first and  second-level cooperating enterprises, which are very quickly  switching to the production of civilian products that are in  demand. Military orders have become unprofitable due to not  being provided financial resources...    [Vodopyanov] ...As a result, whereas before seamen often  complained about a number of low tactical and technical  parameters of newly built ships and the insufficient  standardization of weapons and combat equipment with which they  were equipped, today the Navy is more concerned about the  discontinuance of deliveries not only of new and modern weapons  but even series-produced weapons. Will it not turn out that the  Russian Navy will celebrate its 300th anniversary not only  without new ships but also with armament from "the Ochakov times  and the conquest of Crimea?"    [Kokoshin] You pose an absolutely valid question. I believe  that we need to maintain the course of keeping a small number of  warships in commission, but the most modern and really  combat-ready, as they say, first-line ships. Such requirements,  of course, also pertain to both aviation and to the other armed  services, but especially to the Navy. We must be sure that if a  ship flies the flag of the Navy and is in commission, it can be  counted upon. In addition, there should be reserve ships with  lower levels of combat readiness and a lower level of manning  than first-line ships. Of course, both must be equipped with  modern weapons. But there are a mass of obstacles here.    [Vodopyanov] Can you dwell on this important aspect in more  detail?    [Kokoshin] In the former USSR, the expenditure mechanism of  the entire life cycle of armament was dominant--from development  to utilization. Often, reporting on the development of a  project, say, for a new ship was the main thing, for which they  handed out awards and prizes. Ships, weapons systems,  life-support systems, and rescue and survival equipment, as it  later turned out, were far from perfect in a number of cases due  to such "reporting mania." Moreover, the vast majority of  armament models were created without expectation of  modernization. We are suffering from this to this day, since it  is impossible to place new electronics, sonar equipment, and  modern types of antennas on ship of most projects.    But the main shortcoming in domestic shipbuilding, it seems,  was the lack of a macro-system approach to construction and  development of the Navy, including basing infrastructure, when  the drive for quantitative and qualitative composition of the  Navy under obviously overstated requirements of naval strategy  (let us recall the "ocean strategy" of Admiral Gorshkov) was  accomplished by painful decisions often dictated not by the Navy  but by the military-industrial complex. There was nothing that  defined the strategy of military shipbuilding--a state program  coordinated by objectives, deadlines, and engineering tasks and  unified for all scientific research institutes and design  bureaus, shipyards, and docks. But those same Americans and  Germans, far richer than us, built ships with a long-range  sight. The Iowa-class battleships are a classic example of a  proprietary attitude toward ships. But where are our Project  68-bis gun cruisers today, which were distinguished by  outstanding naval architecture and fair seagoing qualities?!    [Vodopyanov] Today the Navy has also lost (basically due to  a  poorly developed shore-basing infrastructure) newer ships; for  example, the heavy aircraft-carrying cruisers Kiev, Minsk, and  Novorossiysk, each of which served less than 20 years...    [Kokoshin] That is because, as I already said above, we  always pursued quantity, ignoring the qualitative  characteristics of the Fleet and paying no attention to costs,  which especially increase when operating less-than-perfect ships  and basing points. Today we are forced to count every ruble;  funds are catastrophically short. How in such conditions to  optimize expenditures for the purchase of equipment and  armament, shipbuilding and repair, and scientific research and  experimental design work? Therefore, in the immediate future we  must not count on any new grandiose projects, but we must solve  more practical problems in order to preserve the maximum of what  we have in the Fleet today. The Navy's main task for the next  2-3 years is survival. I will note that it is not vegetation,  but survival with the evolutionary accumulation of combat might,  structural and operational reorganization, being inspired by the  lofty idea of the historical greatness of the homeland, and  realization of its need for armed forces, and the Navy in  particular. We must not forget that the Navy is still a special  instrument of the state which can be used not only for purely  military but also political tasks. I have in mind showing the  Russian flag. I am convinced that we must accomplish the latter  constantly, and there is no room for a bookkeeping approach  here. A warship, especially a beautiful one (and Soviet, now  Russian, ships are famous for their architecture), evokes  admiration and respect. We must work out a kind of philosophy of  using the Fleet, when it serves as a powerful factor of  deterring an aggressor, without entering into combat operations  but simply cruising back and forth off the coast or even beyond  the horizon, and influences political "solitaire" along with  other means and measures.    [Vodopyanov] Especially since the Russian and Soviet Navy  has  such experience...    [Kokoshin] I have talked a lot with veterans of the Navy who  have more than once sailed the Mediterranean Sea, Indian Ocean,  and Pacific Ocean. In a number of cases, our Navy played a very  important role, when the situation was stabilized at a  comparatively low level of escalation of some or other conflict  by the sending of a detachment of our ships. No one guarantees  that military threats in the world to the security of Russia  will come to naught completely. So, we must be realists--we  cannot get along without a Navy worthy of Russia.

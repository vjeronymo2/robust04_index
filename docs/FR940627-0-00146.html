			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The data search must include available literature on welfare effects, including, but not limited to, the exposure and response of plants and animals to whole emissions and individual components of emissions, the potential for bioaccumulation, and the concentration and persistence of emission products in the air, soil, and water. Available results of exposure modeling analyses, environmental and atmospheric fate modeling studies, field studies, monitoring studies, accident evaluations, or environmental simulation experiments must be included to characterize potential exposures and the environmental impact of F/FA emissions. Specific ecological studies addressing the potential environmental effects of F/FA emissions on vegetation, livestock, wildlife, aquatic species, and soil organisms must be included. In addition, the data search must address the welfare effects of F/FA emissions concerning their contribution to odor and visibility nuisances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both public and in-house available sources must be included in the literature survey. Information on the health and environmental effects of <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> F/FAs is to be compiled from peer- reviewed scientific journals and other literature as well as internal industry studies, government-sponsored reports, proceedings of scientific meetings, and other documented sources. In general, EPA will place greater confidence in studies that have been subject to peer review. A search of appropriate commercially available chemical, toxicological, and environmental data bases must be conducted to obtain information from published sources. An example list of commercially available data bases that may be used to obtain information on potential health and environmental effects, as well as environmental fate data, is available in the public docket of this rule. <FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 41 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See memorandum from Ines del C. Figueroa to Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;07 (Item No. IV&hyph;B&hyph;03) regarding ``List of Data Bases.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, EPA proposed that literature searches cover at least fifteen years. However, in response to public comments, EPA has increased this time period to cover at least thirty years prior to the date of submission, so that important information from earlier testing will not be omitted. In addition, literature searches must be current as of six months prior to the beginning of testing. The thirty years are not meant to be an absolute limit for data collection. EPA encourages F/FA manufacturers to do a comprehensive search that will include all relevant available information, regardless of the age of the data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The information to be submitted to EPA as a result of the data search includes the following items: (1) Brief text summary of the general findings and conclusions, including references, (2) a printed copy of the outputs from the data base searches, including reference list and associated abstracts, (3) complete documentation in scientific journal format of unpublished in-house or other privately-conducted studies, and (4) tables summarizing the protocols and results of all cited studies, organized by health or environmental endpoint and type of emissions (e.g., whole combustion emission, individual emission product). In addition, the person(s) or contractor(s) conducting the literature search and summary must be identified. Further discussion on the reporting requirements of this final rule is included in Section XII.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Adequate Existing Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The primary purpose of the literature search is to provide EPA with a comprehensive survey of the available data on health and welfare effects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> F/FAs. A secondary function of the literature search is to enable F/FA manufacturers to document the extent to which the emission characterization in Tier 1 and/or the evaluation of health effects included in Tier 2 have already been addressed by previous adequate testing and/or analysis. If adequate testing/analysis exists, F/FA manufacturers may submit such previous data in compliance with the requirements of the registration program. For example, if previous emission characterization studies addressing the speciation requirements of this program are available in the literature, then F/FA manufacturers may submit those studies in lieu of new characterization tests. Similarly, F/FA manufacturers could use the literature search to determine the availability of adequate biological tests in compliance with Tier 2 requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To satisfy the testing requirements of Tier 1 and/or 2 with previously conducted studies, reports of such previous tests must be sufficiently detailed to allow EPA to judge the adequacy of protocols, techniques, experimental design, statistical analyses, and data interpretation. Documentation must be sufficient to determine if the previously conducted studies were performed in a manner consistent with generally accepted scientific principles, good laboratory practices, and the specific testing guidelines in question. The age of the data will be considered but will not be the ultimate determining factor in deciding if an existing study is adequate. Although changes in technological approaches and methodology might preclude the use of some older studies, EPA recognizes that older literature can be useful for the purposes of this program. Thus, the quality of the study will be the deciding factor in determining the adequacy of existing studies, not the age per se. Additional criteria to be used in determining the adequacy of existing data/studies in relation to Tier 2 compliance are provided in Section VIII.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

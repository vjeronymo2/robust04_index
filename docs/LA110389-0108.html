			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: SHOCK ART  </P> <P> Almost Banned in Boston: A practitioner of shock art, who lit fireworks on his  chest during an appearance in Boston, has touched off a swirl of comments on  how much is too much in this genre. Joe Coleman, appearing before a small  audience at the Boston Film and Video Foundation, bit off the head and front  legs of a white mouse and hugged one spectator after he poured a bucket of  blood over himself. When he ignited fireworks on his chest, some burning shards  landed in the audience, endangering spectators. Fire officials said they would  press for charges. Patrons, animal-rights activists and some arts leaders all  said Coleman went too far. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

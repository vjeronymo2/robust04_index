At  its extraordinary session it examined normative documents for  the adoption of the so-called Steppe Code instead of the  constitution in operation at present. The mechanism for  reworking the republic's legislative basis was approved by 25  parliamentarians who have thus decided the fate of the entire  people living on the territory of Kalmykia.    Less than two weeks have been assigned for a discussion of  the Steppe Code. After it has been adopted, if it is adopted,  the republic's supreme legislative organ will be the people's  khural, which Kalmyk President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov could dissolve  at any moment, considering that it is failing to ensure  stability in society.</p>

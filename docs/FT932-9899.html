			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Talks on restructuring Dollars 44bn commercial debt TALKS reopened yesterday between Brazil and the full committee of its foreign creditor banks over a deal to restructure the country's Dollars 44bn (Pounds 28.5bn) commercial debt. Mr Pedro Malan, Brazil's chief debt negotiator, said in an interview before the talks that the main item on the agenda would be redrawing the balance of debt conversion options made by the banks in February. The banks chose heavily in favour of the par bond option, an instrument fully guaranteed for principal and one year's interest and consequently the most expensive for Brazil. The banks wanted 64 per cent of the total stock of debt in that option. Mr Malan said this has dropped to 59 per cent after concessions by big banks, but it far exceeds the 40 per cent maximum desired by Brazil.</p>

The submarine sank on April 7, 1989. It carried two  torpedoes with nuclear warheads and four conventional torpedoes.  Komsomolets was the third Soviet submarine that sank as a  result of a technical failure.    Borisov said that raising the submarine was out of the  question because its titanium hull, torpedo compartment hatch  rods and bodies of the torpedoes, notably carrying nuclear  warheads, were damaged.    Even though the nuclear reactor of the submarine was  damaged,  it was said to be safe with the radiation leak level being about  10 Ci per liter but the possible disintegration of torpedo  nuclear warheads might result in leakage of plutonium and  environmental damage.    Borisov said that plans were about to be finalized to seal  the torpedo compartment of Komsomolets. The works, he said,  will be carried out next summer at a cost of one to two billion  rubles. The Russian government was said to have made a decision  to appropriate the funds. Once the sealing is done, Borisov  said, a program of extracting nuclear warheads from the  submarine will have to be devised.</p>

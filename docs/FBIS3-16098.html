			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [No dateline as received] -- Andrey Kozyrev, the  head of Russian diplomacy, has spoken in favor of strategic  partnership between Russian and the United States at a news  conference held at Vnukovo airport prior to his departure for  Vladivostok to meet his U.S. counterpart Warren Christopher.    Answering questions about the Ames' affair and also about  the  events linked to the visit of Former U.S. President Richard  Nixon to Moscow, the Russian foreign minister expressed an  opinion that there were certain circles both in the United  States and Russia that did not like the idea of cooperation  between Russia and the United States, especially strategic  cooperation.    A. Kozyrev added that Russian-U.S. relations will continue  to  be based on the principles stated in the Moscow Declaration.  This partnership is strategic and mature and its main features  are community of interests and close contacts.    Commenting on the situation in former Yugoslavia at the  request of journalists, the Russian foreign minister noted that  the decisions of the Security Council envisaged the use of force  in extreme cases. He explained that this refers, for example,  to attacks on peacekeeping formations. We adhere to this  principle, Kozyrev said. The Russian peacekeepers, he stressed,  should not be hostages to the tension in the region.    Analyzing the prospects for a settlement in the Near East  following his trip to the region, the leader of Russian  diplomacy pointed out that at present one of the main aims is to  complete the talks on the Gaza sector and Jericho. Only after  that will it be possible, in his opinion, to convene a new  Madrid Conference in one form or another.    Speaking of his planned short visit to Tajikistan after his  Vladivostok meeting, Kozyrev pointed out that such a trip  presents a good opportunity to hold talks both with the  government and the opposition. He said he would try to visit  the Tajik-Afghan frontier in order to support Russian border  guards. The minister said in the extreme case we are prepared  for a rebuff, but our choice is dialogue, which should begin  shortly.    Commenting upon the reports on the possible use of Western  countries' peacekeeping forces in Georgia, the minister said  that he did not yet see a real opportunity for that. He said  that this question might be one of the topics discussed in  Vladivostok.</p>

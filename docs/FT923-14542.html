			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Drawings show sketchy success: Saleroom A WEEK of Old Master sales in London got off to a sticky start yesterday. Although well over half of the lots at a Sotheby's sale of drawings found buyers, the three lots that were estimated at more than Pounds 100,000 each  -works by Philippe de Champaigne, Claude and Boucher - failed to reach their reserves. A delicate pen and brown ink and wash drawing by Parmigianino was also bought in. There is, however, a continuing interest in good 16th and 17th century Italian drawings that are fresh to the art market. The top lot yesterday was a highly finished preparatory study (circa 1623) by Ferrau Fenzoni for an altarpiece now in the Pinacoteca at Faenza. The keen interest forced the price up to double the amount estimated, and it was bought by Flavia Ormond Fine Art for Pounds 55,000. A rare and newly discovered red chalk drawing of Fortitude by Primaticcio also did well, changing hands at Pounds 34,100. An early GB Tiepolo pen and ink drawing of the Holy Family and saints realised Pounds 37,400. Dutch drawings also held their own. The sale totalled Pounds 638,702 with 55 per cent by value of the items left unsold.</p>

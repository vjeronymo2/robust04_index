The former  president of the Iranian Republic, Abolhassan Bani Sadr, who  came to power in 1981, only to be deposed by the parliament 18  months later, rants and raves in his own particular manner,  [which is] both oriental and Parisian. Without dropping his shy  smile and virtual whisper, he said: "The government is  respecting neither its laws, nor the European extradition  treaty. Not so long ago, it was committed to `terrorizing the  terrorists.' Who said this is the country of human rights?"  [passage omitted]    How can the French Government's refusal to extradite Mohsen  Sharif Espahani and Ahmad Taheri to Switzerland be explained?  Bani Sadr evokes the choice between fear of a new wave of  terrorist activity and deliberate complicity. "Fear? I do not  think so. Every time a government gives in to a terrorist state  it is encouraging acts of violence. When Naccache was sent back  to Iran they assassinated Bakhtiar. And look at Algeria. No.  There is some form of complicity between the Iranian regime and  the French Government." He then goes on to describe Iran as the  "only country in the world whose foreign policy can be summed up  as [being characterized by] terrorism, arms purchases,  indebtedness, and large-scale corruption."    But what complicity? Continuing his argument cautiously,  Bani Sadr, his gaze fixed on the floor, calls to mind Gorbachev,  abandoned by Europe, while the Iranian regime, [which is]  "greatly weakened and highly indebted, and which is only being  propped up by foreign support," has received $30 billion in  short-term aid over the last four years. "It is facilitating  the task of these governments in the Muslim world. It stands  for Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism. It is serving to  supplant the threat of communism and generate fear."    The revolt of Bani Sadr, [who remains] motionless, is  visible  only on his face. He interrupts himself while tea is served,  then puts forward a hypothesis: "If the French Government  committed the despicable act of sending back the two accused,  then it did so because something happened regarding Algeria.  Perhaps France obtained an undertaking from the Iranian regime  that it would stop providing military and financial aid to  Algerian terrorists. If terrorism effectively ceases in  Algeria, then France will be able to say that it scored a great  victory."    Was sending back the two accused the gift offered by France  to appease the Iranian anger provoked by the return to France of  Mariam Radjavi, wife of the leader of the People's Mujahidin and  the "future president" enthroned by her followers? For the  former Iranian president, the fury of the Mullahs' press, which  denounced French complicity with the "terrorists" of her  calibre, was only superficial and "was unleashed just after  Charles Pasqua [minister of interior] had started to chase the  Algerians out of France." More precisely, "when France consents  to send back the assassins of the Muslim Brotherhood, then it  must consider this group to be finished. The arrival of  Radjavi's wife did not inconvenience Iran; on the contrary. It  indicated the defeat of the Mujahidin." [passage omitted]</p>

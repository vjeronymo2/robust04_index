			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE  </P> <P> Realtors Contribute: The North Orange County board of Realtors recently  presented a $5,000 check to Fullerton Interfaith Emergency Services, operator  with the Salvation Army of a food distribution center for the poor.  </P> <P> The check followed an emergency plea for financial assistance from the food  bank, which found its shelves all but bare.  </P> <P> The center typically helps feed 400 families, or about 1,600 people, a month.  In April, it received requests for help from 2,800 people.  </P> <P> The North County realty board sponsors a food drive for the center each  Christmas season and its 1989 drive netted more than 50 tons of foodstuffs, as  well as several thousand dollars in cash.  </P> <P> But the near-doubling of the center's caseload, which interfaith center  Executive Director Barbara Johnson said might have had its roots in the  temporary closing of the Share Our Selves center in Costa Mesa, has emptied the  shelves a lot faster than is normal.  </P></p>

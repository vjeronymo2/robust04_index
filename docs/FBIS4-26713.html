			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Cao Min: "Five Die In Glue Factory Explosion"] </F>   [Text] Five workers were killed and another two seriously  injured by an explosion at a joint venture in eastern Beijing's  Tongxian County last Tuesday morning.    The blast wrecked the Hong Kong-invested Huaxin Chemical  Company Ltd factory at 7:45 am while the seven people were  mixing a solvent adhesive in the workshop, according to Yang  Wanlu, an official from Beijing's Municipal Labour Bureau.    "One of the reasons for the accident was the joint venture's  poor management and improper operation," said Yang.    Since June last year, a number of major industrial accidents  with fatalities have hit the headlines, particularly from the  southern coastal areas. Many of the disasters have been  attributed to slack management and lax safety procedures.</p>

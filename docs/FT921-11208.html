			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Kidnapping, a respectable job: Who would own up to being a journalist or a policeman? Asks Dominic Lawson AFTER THE introduction and 'How do you do?' the next question always seems to be 'What do you do?'. I've always thought this routine of the first meeting rather depressing, suggesting as it does that work is the most interesting aspect of a person's life and character. Why, just for once, can't the follow-up to the already trite 'How do you do?' (no one except Jewish women of a certain age ever gives a truthful answer to this inquiry) be 'What is your favourite novel?' or 'What is your favourite piece of music?' or 'If you could murder anyone and get away with it, who would be your first victim?' It would make life so much more interesting and unpredictable. I suppose my insecurity over this matter of identification by career stems partly from the fact that I am a journalist and therefore a member of a profession universally held in lower esteem. Well, not universally - journalists hold themselves in the highest esteem. But I am often tempted when asked 'what do you do?' to reply 'writer', or more riskly, 'editor', or sometimes, evasively, that 'I run a small organisation in the publishing business.' Anything to avoid being pigeon-holed as nosey and untrustworthy. But unfortunately, I have come to the conclusion that, in a free society, it may actually be that what one does for a living does genuinely reveal more about one than any other piece of information. This in turn suggests that the common prejudices about certain professions may be absolutely accurate. For example, one is brought up to believe that, while on the whole good sorts, policemen, alas, are stupid. Every child is familiar with PC Plod, and goes on to read detective books in which one amateur sleuth of less than supernatural intelligence runs rings around the entire Metropolitan Police Force. And I am afraid that recent events bear out these childhood prejudices. The many recent cases of false arrest and imprisonment are as much a story of stupidity as they are of corruption, although the Left will always favour the latter interpretation. And now we have the bizarre case of the kidnap for ransom of the Birmingham estate agency girl, Stephanie Slater. It seems scarcely credible that 1,000 plainclothes policemen in 500 unmarked cars could fail to apprehend the villain, who was kind enough to drop Stephanie Slater barely 200 yards from her home. The Sun newspaper - which seems to have gleaned the following 'facts' about the villain: 'Age: 40s. Height: 5 ft 7 inches. Brains: above average. Character: he's Mr Cool' - speculates that the officers lost the kidnapper in fog when he picked up the Pounds 175,000 provided by Miss Slater's employers, Royal Life Insurance. Perhaps, in the style made famous by British Rail, we may later be told by the police that it was 'the wrong sort of fog.' But I rather enjoyed the comment of the officer in control of the operation that the escape of both the villain and his booty was 'the only negative side at this time.' Unless the police do speedily arrest the criminal, I fear that another 'negative' will be a large number of imitative kidnaps. Perhaps it is just unfortunate that on the same day as the police lost 'Mr Cool' in the fog, it was revealed that two men who broke a window to burgle a newsagent's shop in Barnstaple, escaped by smashing open a replacement window speedily installed by glaziers who had been called by the police on the spot. According to yesterday's Daily Telegraph, 'The burglars laid low while officers investigated the smashed window, and then they made off with Pounds 200-worth of cigarettes when they found the coast was clear.' To be consistent we must allow that other professions are equally susceptible to accurate stereotyping. We may assume that most theatre designers and many vicars are homosexual, that most financiers are greedy, that most politicians are power-crazed, that most professional chess players are paranoid, that most nurses are angels, that most actors are egotists, that most lawyers are heartless, and, yes, that most journalists are nosey and untrustworthy. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

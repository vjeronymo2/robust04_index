			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Letter: Monarchy - political dimensions of a show that will run and run Sir, David Cannadine's gall-flavoured colonial view of our 'anachronistic relic' (his words) of a monarchy ('The royal dilemma that won't go away', December 12) may very well be grist to the mills of those of your readers who suffer from some ill-defined nightmare of a monarchical 'democratic deficit' in this country. While it is indeed true that our politicians use the crown as a cloak for their generally incompetent and nefarious doings, it is even more true that the monarch protects us from the ultimate indignity of a politician as head of state (given that we would hardly be so fortunate as to find another Richard von Weizsacker here). The monarchy also ensures that there is someone of commonsense and sanity to take over in the event, hardly inconceivable these days, of the politicians finally becoming so incompetent that they cannot keep the 'ship of state' afloat any longer, bail as they might] Brian H Gill, 261 Grove Street, London SE8 3PZ</p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORDINANCE WOULD RESTRICT JETSKIS  </P> <P> The launching and operation of jetskis, motorized surfboards and the like will  be restricted along the Newport Beach shoreline if an ordinance introduced by  the City Council early Tuesday is adopted next month.  </P> <P> A public hearing on the proposed ordinance is scheduled at the May 8 Newport  Beach City Council meeting.  </P> <P> Because Newport Beach has the least restrictive jetski regulations of all  county coastal cities, the city Marine Department said in a report to the City  Council, there has been "a rapid increase" in jetski use there.  </P> <P> To avoid conflicts among swimmers, surfers and jetski riders, Newport Beach's  parks, beaches and recreation commission drafted the ordinance, noting that all  other county cities with beachfront homes bar jetskis year round.  </P> <P> It prohibits beach launching of the vessels from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. from May 1  to Sept. 30. When the vessels are operated outside of those months, they are to  be used no nearer the shore than 100 feet seaward of the surf line -- although  that distance may be increased at next month's council meeting.  </P> <P> Jetski manufacturers and enthusiasts have opposed restricting their use.  However, by the time the ordinance was introduced shortly after midnight, there  were just 15 people in the council chambers.  </P> <P> No one spoke against the ordinance. The only speaker in favor was Thomas P.  Pratte, executive vice president of the Huntington Beach-based Surfrider  Foundation, a conservation group that focuses on public access and recreation  rights, particularly surfing.  </P> <P> "Jetskis and anybody else in the water just don't mix," Pratte said.  </P> <P> He said the noise for others in the water "is like 20 neighbors running their  lawn mowers at once."

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Morbid twist to a scandalous saga: Victims of Italy's crackdown Suicide has shrouded Italy's corruption scandals in the trappings of classical tragedy. The deaths this week, first of Gabriele Cagliari, the former chairman of ENI, the state oil concern, and yesterday Raul Gardini, the leading Italian financial entrepreneur of the 1980s, have injected a note of high drama into the extraordinary process of change brought about by the 18-month judicial investigations into illicit financing of political parties. So far 10 persons under investigation have taken their lives. But Mr Cagliari and Mr Gardini have touched a particular national nerve. Both were captains of industry, one state, the other private-sector. They symbolised the heady success of the 1980s and both had fallen from their pedestals. Charges had yet to be pressed against Mr Gardini, but the investigative net was closing in on him. Mr Cagliari had already admitted to knowing about at least L50bn (Pounds 20.95m) worth of illicit funding channelled through ENI and its subsidiaries to the Socialist and Christian Democrat parties. The human tragedy, however, has not obscured the backdrop against which these events occurred. 'The common thread behind these deaths is the collapse of the conditions in which each of these personalities lived and operated,' observed Mr Luciano Violante, head of the parliamentary anti-Mafia commission. It is a compelling thesis to see the suicides as the final stages of a post-war political-economic system that has become hopelessly discredited. Neither Mr Cagliari nor Mr Gardini could be called innocents. The 67-year-old former ENI chairman was both a servant of, and an accomplice in, the system being ruthlessly exposed by magistrates. Over the past year, ENI has emerged as the largest single source of illicit funding for the political parties. For his part, Mr Gardini exploited the system and played by its rules, even if this meant paying politicians in return for commercial privilege. Nevertheless the manner of the deaths induces pathos and sympathy. Mr Cagliari killed himself with a plastic bag over his head, tied with a shoelace, after being held for 133 days in prison. In a suicide note he said he was protesting against the Milan magistrates' refusal to grant him bail. Mr Gardini shot himself as yesterday's papers printed extracts of damning testimony from Mr Giuseppe Garofano, his former management colleague at Ferruzzi-Montedison, alleging fraudulent practices in Italy's second-largest private group. Mr Gardini was alleged to have arranged up to L100bn in political bribes, raised through off-balance sheet property deals, and accused of illicitly covering a hole of more than Dollars 350m caused by commodity trading losses. These accusations appeared in extracts released by Il Mondo magazine which has consistently published reliable testimony from interrogations in the scandals. The immediate effect of the deaths has been to expose a growing division between those who wish to halt the power of the magistrates - and by the same token rein in the scope of their investigations - and those who want a cathartic indictment of the political system that has ruled Italy since 1945. In the first group are the bulk of businessmen and the politicians. This is not surprising. Since one in six parliamentarians is under investigation for corruption, they have a vested interest. The business community is genuinely afraid that a concerted investigation of business methods risks invalidating most company balance sheets. This week, some politicians have tried to exploit Mr Cagliari's death to confuse the issue between the magistrates' methods and the scope of their inquiries. As a result, the magistrates will be obliged to use more restrictively their considerable powers of preventive detention. But the magistrates cannot be forced to halt their investigations without a battle between the judiciary and the legislature. Significantly, Mr Cagliari was the first top public-sector figure to be arrested, and his detention on March 9 came immediately after a public outcry had forced President Oscar Scalfaro to reject government proposals for an amnesty of those involved in the corruption scandals. The evidence this week suggests that despite public shock and personal sympathy over the suicides, most people are firmly behind the magistrates. The current parliament would enjoy little support for legislating an end to the investigative process. But pressure for such legislation might come from the many companies, state and private, which have incurred losses through a combination of greater international competition and recession. Mr Gardini's death will further complicate the rescue of the Ferruzzi group, will affect four or five leading financiers who were his associates, and will touch on the banks which are exposed to Ferruzzi's L31,000bn debt. Other big groups - Fiat, De Benedetti's Olivetti and Berlusconi's Fininvest  -are caught up in the corruption scandals and risk damage from further probes. The magistrates have yet to decide whether to tackle the state-controlled banking sector - which would be the most sensitive investigation of all.</p>

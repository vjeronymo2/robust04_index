			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Leena Hayrinen: "Whose Decision Was It To Join </F> the EU Anyway? Will Those Decisionmakers Now Come Forward"]    [Text] The Center Party's Paavo Vayrynen has once again on  his own initiative forcefully entered the Finnish internal  policy debate. Vayrynen's diverging opinions concerning results  Finland achieved in negotiations with the European Union [EU]  has caused confusion not only within the Center Party troops but  also among other political groupings.    The most sensational politician of the spring of 1994  steadfastly holds his ground: He demands that those people who  accepted the negotiation agreement have to answer to the Finnish  people why Finland gave up its most important goals towards the  end of the negotiations. In Vayrynen's opinion the culprits  placed the timetable ahead of the end results, causing  immeasurable damage.    He denies the assertions that he is looking for political  gain for himself. The recent polemics in the papers, in his  opinion, once again is a sign that the atmosphere is getting  more intolerant towards diverging opinions.    "Who decided that Finland had to go along with the agreement  on the EU membership, even though the goals had not been  reached?" That is what parliamentarian Vayrynen is asking.    "Feeling? Good!" Vayrynen exclaims. He is smiling happily,  he is telling the truth: He is in his own element, and that  includes suffering. The familiar, calm voice is telling the  story we have heard before: Vayrynen has come to a turning point  once again.    He is being treated harshly, the vultures are circling  above,  attacking him mercilessly. Reporters who do not understand  Vayrynen are at it again, and they do not refrain from using  underhanded means.    "When I think about how I have been treated after the  presidential elections, I get the feeling there is no room for  me in this country. No matter what I do, it is always wrong."    Vayrynen does not see himself as the poor little boy who  landed at the bottom of the ditch, and who everyone doubts will  ever get up and out of there, although it is generally known,  too, that he has come out of terrible situations over and over  again.    "In the presidential elections I did very well, and  everything that I have done since then has been just right."  <H5>  No Stand on EU </H5>   Vayrynen points out that he has not taken a stand on the EU  membership as yet. He will have to do it together with the  others in the event that his proposal to postpone it will not be  accepted.    "Later on our negotiation position would be much stronger,  because our economy is getting better. We would not need to get  support for the transition period, and consequently we would get  more permanent support from the EU, thus improving our  competitive position. We could also accept somewhat smaller  regional policy support since that does not provide as great a  national gain as the fact that the competitive situation will be  leveled out on the food industry markets."    He believes firmly that the EU would want to have Finland as  a member even later on, even if we would put on the brakes  rights now. We are a very good member, if we join. "Even if  the EU would agree to conditions that are more beneficial to us,  we still would bring our additional contributions to the EU."    Vayrynen wants to deny the claim that there are only two  alternatives: yes or no. He believes that even if the no votes  would win, the membership could be taken up again for  negotiations sooner or later.  <H5>  Who Did It? </H5>   Vayrynen was himself foreign minister at the time when the  decision was made to apply for the EU membership, and he is  still of the opinion that it was the right decision.    "The mistake was made in February-March, when Finland  decided  to conclude the agreement with poor conditions. They did not  hang on to the negotiation goals that had been set. If they had  continued to negotiate, certainly a few additional concessions  could have been gained. Now they were in a hurry to make this  decision because of the EU parliamentary elections," Vayrynen  criticizes.    "It would be interesting to know how they made this  decision.  Who did it and what were the grounds on the basis of which this  course of action was regarded as wise? That is something we do  not know," Vayrynen says. He points out there are rumors going  around about this issue, however, he is not going to repeat  them.    "I would consider it only right, however, that those who  made  the decision should also give their justification for the  matter, after all, now the Finns will be tied to the decision."    [SUOMEN KUVALEHTI] If you were president, would you talk  about the matter now the same way?    [Vayrynen] No. If I had been president, Finland would not  have concluded the agreement under these conditions.    [SUOMEN KUVALEHTI] So are you now referring to the incumbent  president? It is my understanding that several persons went  along with this, apparently both the previous and the current  president, the prime minister, and the chief negotiators, at  least this circle. I do not know if larger groups were  involved. Democratic principles would require that they tell  how this conclusive decision was made.    [Vayrynen] It has been my experience that when important  decisions are made it is prudent to assess ahead of time under  what conditions the agreement will be accepted and the  negotiations will then be continued until satisfactory  conditions will be reached, otherwise the agreement will not be  concluded. During the last weeks of the EU negotiations there  was a decisive change. All of a sudden we were ready to join  when the timetable became more important than the content.  <H5>  Emotional Problems </H5>   In Vayrynen's opinion, the agreement that was reached is  poor  with regard to content and its schedule impossible.    The most fundamental weakness of the content, according to  Vayrynen, is the fact that the agricultural support system for  northern Finland that had been set as a goal was not reached.  When the EU territory will make a transition to the free trade  of agricultural products, the competitive premises of Finnish  farms will be poor. And furthermore, the EU has a common  agricultural policy that favors areas with better conditions  than Finland's.    "And the thought that the Finnish taxpayers would then  salvage what we lost with this agreement is ludicrous in my  opinion. It just is not possible to pay so much support that we  could guarantee the future of our own food industry."    The alternative is not cheap, either, for the taxpayer.    "It depends on how you calculate it. Right now we have the  opportunity to take advantage of the border protection in order  to protect our own food production, therefore we need less  support from the taxpayers to maintain our own agriculture. But  if we join the EU, then we can only use the taxpayers' money.  The decisions are made somewhere else, and the Finnish taxpayer  is allowed to support the mighty masters of Germany, France, and  Denmark.    ``If we open our eyes and take a good look, this decision  forebodes very gloomy prospects for the future with regard to  the rural areas, agriculture, food industry, and thus the whole  national economy,'' Vayrynen claims.    The Finnish discussion of the EU membership has been rather  irrational, in Vayrynen's opinion. He is asking how the  reporter intends to translate a strange word for the readers.  Then he clarifies it himself, "So it is a question of image and  emotions!"    He admits that as a member Finland would be permitted to  participate in making decisions on matters that it already has  agreed to within the framework of the European Economic Area  (EEA), pointing out that actually this is the only significant  issue on a general level that favors the membership.    With regard to the food processing industry, the  justification is inadequate in his opinion: The membership would  be tantamount to changing from our own independent agricultural  policy to the supranational decisionmaking within the EU. "We  have no reason to anticipate that the strongest producing  countries would treat us any better as members than when we  negotiated about the conditions."  <H5>  As a Member of Parliament </H5>   In Vayrynen's opinion many people even want to be deceived  in  this EU matter. "They do not want to hear the unpleasant truth,  but try to convince themselves, instead, that they will manage  somehow. It is difficult to stick to your own opinion under the  pressures from the public opinion," he notes.    "And then there are people like this reckless Vayrynen who  is  not afraid to tell how the things really are, and of course he  is pelted with stones. I intend to continue, nevertheless."    Vayrynen rejects the suggestion that on the basis of his  taking this position he is trying to drive his party into  opposition while all the others are very prominently expressing  their support for the EU. As a matter of fact he sees the  matter in a totally different light: In order to gain needed  majority for the membership in the parliament, the government  also will have to have forces that enjoy the confidence of the  doubters.    When asked, Vayrynen assures that after 24 years of  experience he holds high respect for the duties of the Finnish  members of parliament, and he believes that it is possible to  make a difference even without official positions. The only  problem such a supercharged person like Vayrynen has is that  there is not enough to do; even before he had to kill time by  writing books.    Next moment, however, he begins to ponder about the  "conditions involving a regular member of the parliament" as  follows: "When you do not have any specific important position  of trust, you need to address the issues in a stronger fashion  if you want your voice to be heard. On the other hand, you are  free to express stronger opinions when you do not need to take  into consideration the limitations of the position.    ``I felt it was my duty to make sacrifices so as to be able  to initiate proper debate. If I had thought about my own  interests, I would have just gone along with the others. But I  am not an image politician. I follow my own way. At times it  is awfully difficult, when everyone is beating me up, sometimes  I am standing in pouring rain, sometimes I am pelted with rocks.  But my conscience is clear. I am confident that the issues will  be understood in a wider context when the dust has settled.''</p>

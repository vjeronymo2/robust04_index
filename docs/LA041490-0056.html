			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE VALLEY / SEBASTIAN ROTELLA : GROUP TARGETS CASTRO'S DOMINO  </P> <P> Cuban Spanish ricochets in the private dining room, fast and hard and soft at  the same time:  </P> <P> "He is a modern Nero," Javier Quintero says.  </P> <P> "He realizes that he is surrounded," says Maria Quintero, his wife. "If we  dance to his tune, that's no good," growls Reynaldo Rodriguez, a white-haired  warrior with chiseled features. "He expects us to want war. They say we want an  invasion, we want to fight. . . . No, that's not the way. What we must tell him  is this: We want elections, we want a plebiscite, we want to be allowed in,  organize, express ourselves, create parties of opposition. Democracy! He  already has the invasion within."  </P> <P> The monthly meeting of the National Assn. of Cuban Lawyers in Exile, California  chapter, is a gathering of voluble veterans of a Thirty Years War. The war has  gained urgency over the past year as the walls of Eastern Europe dissolve with  the speed of images flickering across the 6 o'clock news.  </P> <P> Energized, the Cuban lawyers discuss ways of bringing about what they see as  the inevitable fall of the next domino: Fidel Castro's Cuba.  </P> <P> Imagine the scene multiplied in Cuban-American communities nationwide,  conversations laced with coffee and smoke and hope.  </P> <P> They talk about the aging dictator -- shaggy, wide-eyed, blustering, defying  all comers during televised harangues. But he is running out of friends. There  have been rumblings, rumors, cries of "Down with Fidel" in public places. He  looks more than ever like an endangered species, a dinosaur-tyrant.  </P> <P> The 25 men and women in the restaurant are in their 50s and 60s, well-dressed,  their dignity forged from the ashes of a frozen tropical past. Most of them  live comfortably rebuilt lives in the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> But all of them remain citizens of El Exilio, The Exile, that Cuban-American  space preserved by nostalgia and passion.  </P> <P> Vindication has been a long time coming, according to Mario Tapanes, who wears  square glasses and gestures pugilistically as he talks.  </P> <P> "Twenty years telling the truth and no one listened," he says. "I have no  confidence in the American media. The media romanticized Castro."  </P> <P> Rodriguez agrees. "They made him into Jesus Christ, the Robin Hood of America.  . . . Finally he has lost stature internationally. . . . For the first time in  the 31 years that he has been in power, I see him truly worried."  </P> <P> Rodriguez is the president of an international federation of former Cuban  political prisoners. He spent six years as a political prisoner, two years in a  squalid compound on the Isle of Pines that he said was rigged with dynamite to  prevent escape or invasion.  </P> <P> Luis Aguirre, association president, calls the meeting to order. Among the  items of past business is a telegram of congratulations sent to Nicaragua's new  president, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.  </P> <P> Rodriguez announces that his prisoners' federation will honor six  Cuban-American officers in the U.S. military for writing an open letter urging  the Cuban army to refrain from violence against their people if there is an  insurrection.  </P> <P> The discussion touches on TV Marti, the latest U.S. government offensive  against Castro, a television version of Radio Free Europe.  </P> <P> Despite efforts by the Cuban government to block the signal, the word from  Miami is that the programs are reaching viewers in Cuba, Tapanes says. He takes  vigorous exception to complaints that the programming includes too many "light"  shows.  </P> <P> "What they are saying here in the press is that it costs $30 million for  nothing, for silly programs. That is not true. When the people there see what  life is like here, how a man who works in a factory lives -- he has his own  car, his computer, the VCR, he goes to McDonald's, he comes and he goes -- that  will have even more impact than the news. These programs carry a message, a  powerful message."  </P> <P> Then Tapanes says he would like to introduce a concept he has encountered in  dealings with corporate America. He savors the syllables:  "Brain-storming-session."  </P> <P> The first time Tapanes took part in a brainstorming session -- people  free-associating and thinking out loud, every opinion given equal value -- he  was amused.  </P> <P> "I thought, 'That's what we Cubans do whenever we get together.' "  </P> <P> Suggestion adopted. A note pad fills with ideas for shaping post-Castro Cuba:  Agrarian reform. Urban reform. Labor reform.  </P> <P> Silver-haired Felix de Quesada adds a suggestion: "Political tolerance in  Cuba."  </P> <P> "Now there's a good specific suggestion," Tapanes says. "What will happen to  the Fidelista or Communist Party in Cuba. Will it be legal?"  </P> <P> "First we shoot them and then we legalize them," Quesada says, deadpan.  </P> <P> Widespread laughter, aimed as much at their own ideological intensity as at the  joke's exaggeration.  </P> <P> Afterward, Aguirre and Ernesto Torres are asked how many people in the room  would go back if the dream of Fidel's fall materializes. The men smile wryly,  they nod, they talk of children and grandchildren and Americanization.  </P> <P> "Probably more would stay than move back," Aguirre says.  </P> <P> "But think about this," Torres says. "I might be a guy who goes on vacation to  Las Vegas, to Baja California. Why do that if I can go back to my own country,  get a little place of my own? . . . Miami is 50 minutes from Cuba. The cultural  movement and interchange would be incredible."  </P> <P> Gatherings such as this serve a cathartic purpose, says Benito Borges. There is  an expression for it, he says, his tough open face growing reflective: Sudar el  odio.  </P> <P>  "Sweat out the hate," he says. "We have to sweat out the hate, as if it were a  fever. So we can go back without hate."  </P></p>

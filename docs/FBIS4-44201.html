			<p>BFN     [Text] Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin arrived in  Libreville yesterday to attend the zone franc summit. He  stressed that African countries have expressed their solidarity  with France for its intervention in Rwanda:    [Begin Roussin recording] I believe that African countries  have expressed their views, in any case, our partners did so.  Everyone expressed its support for France, there are no hidden  agendas or reservations. I believe that everyone spoke, all our  friends supported France, and I believe that this was important,  but this is not the reason behind our meeting. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary: "Freedom for Parliament in Irbil"] </F>   [Text] Dear listener: You must be surprised at the  headline because it calls for freedom for the parliament that is  supposed to be the guarantor of freedom. This appeal has been  prompted by the fact that international parliamentary figures  and blocs from various European and other countries have  recently sent letters to the speaker of the Kurdistan National  Council, the Kurdistan parliament, in Irbil. The letters call  on him to hold a parliament meeting to discuss problems  resulting from the current crisis and the regrettable clashes in  Iraqi Kurdistan and provide solutions for them.    The speaker of parliament responded to these letters,  explaining the situation as it really is.    Respected listeners; Our people's friends from the members  of world parliaments are, of course, right. What they demand  should be achieved because logically it is the best way out of  the crisis if there are attentive people with sound eyes and  ears. However, the facts on the ground are both comic and  tragic. The Kurdistan parliament is besieged by war. To make  what we say more explicit, we say:    1. On a momentous hour the night of 3-4 May 1994, the  fighters of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] headed for  the parliament building in Irbil. After disarming and beating  the parliament's guards, they occupied the building and  plundered some of the furniture. Then they went to the roof of  the building and transformed it into a trench for confrontation  and battles.    2. Despite bilateral [as heard] attempts and other attempts  within the framework of the Kurdistan Front, the PUK fighters  continued to occupy the building.    3. In a report disseminated worldwide on 20 May 1994, REUTER  correspondent, Mr. (Alistair Belloc), said that the PUK fighters  are occupying the parliament and other government buildings in  Irbil.    4. The PUK fighters attacked a number of ministries and  government departments, especially the finance and education  ministries. They broke doors and looted some furniture. They  placed barricade over the roofs of these buildings.    5. Fighters of the PUK are establishing barricades and  checkpoints on streets leading to the parliament and Council of  Ministers buildings, as well as the education, finance, culture,  and other ministries which are adjacent to each other and very  close to the parliament building.    Thus, it is very difficult to hold a parliament meeting in  this tense atmosphere and amid these military measures.  Naturally, we warmly welcome initiatives and appeals by our  friends from world parliaments and parliamentary blocs in  various countries. We support presenting problems and tackling  them in parliament because this is the natural solution of the  problem. But how can a meeting be convened under the shadow of  arms and in a tense atmosphere?    Therefore, we propose that all fighters should withdraw as  soon as possible from the roof and from inside the parliament  building, that the protection of the building should be restored  to the original guards entrusted with protecting parliament,  that the stolen furniture be restored to the building, that the  fighters leave all government departments, and that the  barricades and checkpoints should be removed from all roads and  streets leading to the parliament and Council of Ministers  buildings. Only then will there be an appropriate atmosphere to  consider convening the parliament so it can exercise its natural  legislative role in an atmosphere of security and freedom.</p>

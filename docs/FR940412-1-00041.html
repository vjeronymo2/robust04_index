Noncurrent liabilities include mortgages, bonds and debentures maturing more than one year from the date of the balance sheet, or other obligations not payable within 12 months.

Discount and expenses on long-term debt shall be recorded in the Deferred Charges balance sheet group. Premiums on long-term debt shall be recorded in the Deferred Credits balance sheet account group. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In cases where debt coming due within 12 months is to be refunded, or where payment is to be made from assets of a type not properly classifiable as current, the amount payable shall not be removed from this classification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Gains or losses on liquidation of bonds, debentures, or other debt securities of the Association shall be entered in profit and loss classification 47000 ``Other Income,'' or 69000 ``Miscellaneous.''

Membership shares shall include par or stated value of shares issued or the cash value of the consideration actually received, in cases of shares having no par or stated value. ``Other Paid-In Capital,'' shall include the excess (premium) or deficiency (discount) of each value of the consideration received from the issue of any shares having par or stated value, donations by stockholders, adjustments of capital resulting from reorganization or recapitalization, and gains or losses from reacquisition and resale or retirement of the Association's shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The ``Retained Earnings'' balance sheet classification shall reflect the balance of net profits, income, and gains of the Association from the date of formation.

This date shall be disclosed in financial statements until such time as the effective date no longer possesses special significance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart D_Profit and Loss Classifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;403.400 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> General. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Each Association shall keep profit and loss accounts in accordance with the Chart of Profit and Loss Accounts in appendix B to this part.

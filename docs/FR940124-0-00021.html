			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several portions of the Federal regulations place requirements with regard to revegetation standards involving fish and wildlife habitat. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 780/784.16 require an operator to provide a protection and enhancement plan for fish and wildlife resources. The scope and level of premine resource information must be determined in consultation with State and Federal agencies responsible for fish and wildlife and be sufficient to develop the protection and enhancement plan that describes how, to the extent possible using BTCA, the operator will minimize disturbance and adverse impacts on fish and wildlife values. An element to be considered is the establishment of vegetation for wildlife food and cover. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.116(a)(1) require that standards for success and statistically valid sampling techniques for measuring success shall be selected by the regulatory authority and included in an approved regulatory program. Additionally, 30 CFR 816/817.116(b)(3)(i) require that minimum stocking and planting arrangements shall be specified by the regulatory authority on the basis of local and regional conditions after consultation with an approval by the State agencies responsible for the administration of forestry and wildlife programs. Specific land uses include areas to be developed for fish and wildlife habitat, recreation, shelter belts, or forest products. Consultation and approval may occur on either a program-wide or a permit-specific basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule at Chapter IV, Section 2(d)(x)(E) was the result of an extensive coordination effort involving LQD, the WGFD, and the coal industry. Public meetings and hearings were also held. Therefore, all necessary processing was conducted that would allow the Director to render a decision on the proposed rule and appendix. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, based on Wyoming's clarification submitted October 7, 1993, in the form of a table specifying rules that conflict with and rules that complement the statutory provisions, it was demonstrated that much of the proposed rule and modifications to appendix A, conflict with the proposed statutes (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;21&hyph;51). Furthermore, in its October 7, 1993, reply to OSM's concerns, Wyoming clarified that the legislation (statutory language) prevails over the conflicting rule language. Consequently, the conflicting proposed rules and modifications to appendix A cannot be approved since they have been superseded by the statutory language. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Director finds the proposed regulations at LQD Rule Chapter IV, Section 2(d)(x)(E) and proposed modifications to Appendix A, are in conflict with and are superseded by the proposed statutory provision at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e) and W.S. 35&hyph;103&hyph;402 (b) and (c), and thus cannot be approved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director is requiring Wyoming to amend its program to establish revegetation shrub density standards in compliance with Section 515(b)(24) of SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 780/784.16, 816/817.97 and 816/817.116. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSM solicited public comment on the proposed amendment and provided opportunity for a public hearing. Numerous comments were received and a public meeting was held. Since OSM is not approving Wyoming's submittal for the reasons given in this rulemaking action and since most of the comments provided technical support for the proposed rule and modifications to Appendix A, that were superseded by the legislative changes, the merit of these comments becomes moot to this rulemaking effort. However, general categories of comments included: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Most commenters supported the proposed rules (20% standard) as minimum standards or as reasonable standards. As discussed in Finding 6, the majority of the proposed rules conflict with the proposed statutory standard and therefore cannot be approved. The legislative standard (10%) is not being approved because of reasons discussed in Finding 5. Since neither standard can be approved the discussion of various technical merits provided by commenters in support of the two standards becomes irrelevant to this rulemaking action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Several commenters recommended changes to the proposed rules and appendix. As previously stated OSM cannot approve the proposed rules and appendix for reasons discussed in Finding 6. Thus, detailed discussion of the comments recommending changes would be of no value to this rulemaking action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Two commenters supported the proposed statutory standard (10%) and did not support the proposed rules and appendix. Additionally, they noted that the rules had been superseded by the statutory language and should not be considered in this amendment. OSM agrees that the proposed rules are superseded by the statutory standard as discussed in Finding 6, but OSM cannot approve the legislative standard (10%) for reasons discussed in Finding 5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Several commenters supported, and several did not support, the proposed statutory language at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b) that provides direction to the Environmental Quality Council in establishing standards. As discussed in Finding 4.a., this provision is confusing and is redundant with Wyoming's approved program. The Director is not approving it and is requiring Wyoming to repeal this provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Most commenters did not support, and several supported, the proposed statutory definitions at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e) (xxviii) through (xxx) that define agricultural lands, critical habitat, and important or crucial habitat. OSM is not approving these proposed statutory definitions as discussed in Findings 1, 2, and 3. OSM does not agree with the few comments that supported these definitions as discussed in this rulemaking action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

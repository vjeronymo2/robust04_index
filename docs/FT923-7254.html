			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Observer: Dishonourable Why aren't there more small businessmen in Britain's class-ridden honours system? It is well known that the Cabinet Office is keen to rejig the honours system and reward people on the basis of merit rather than status. Observer hears that when the faceless bureaucrats at the Department of Trade and Industry were asked recently to put forward more names of small entrepreneurs for the honours list, they had a ready excuse as to why it would be inadvisable. Apparently, the DTI seems to be under the impression that most small businessmen, in order to be successful, have to sail close to the law . . . . If true, it's an interesting perspective on how civil servants see business, and why it is difficult to succeed in the UK.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: Earnings at Unisys rise as revenues decline UNISYS, the US computer and electronics group, achieved earnings growth in its first quarter in spite of a decline in revenues. Continuing its recovery from heavy losses in 1989-91, it reduced debts and reported strong cash-flow, with the highest operating margins in five years. Net earnings before special items were Dollars 56.8m, or 16 cents per primary share and 23 cents per fully-diluted share, which includes convertible preferred stock and convertible bonds. Including a special gain, net income was Dollars 260.6m and earnings per share Dollars 1.39 primary and Dollars 1.06 fully diluted. Earnings were in line with Wall Street expectations. Special items included a charge of Dollars 26.4m for the settlement of legal actions connected with the sale of the Sperry Aerospace Group in December 1986, and two accounting changes that produced a net gain of Dollars 230m. In the same period last year, net income was Dollars 48.3m, or 11 cents per common share. Revenue for the quarter was Dollars 1.91bn, down from Dollars 2.01bn. Revenue growth in the US commercial information systems market was more than offset by continued market weakness in Europe and Japan and the negative effects of exchange rates. Debt, net of cash, stood at Dollars 1.5bn, the lowest since the company was formed in 1986. Unisys said that, as anticipated, worldwide orders declined in the quarter.</p>

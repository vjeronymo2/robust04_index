			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Domtar trims shortfall in first quarter DOMTAR, the big pulp and paper and building materials group, narrowed its losses in the first quarter helped by strong timber products prices and firming fine papers and gypsum wallboard markets, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal Domtar's fine paper mills continued to gain in efficiency and the lower Canadian dollar also helped.

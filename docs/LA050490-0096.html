			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA;  </P> <P> RANCHER DROPS PLAN TO BUILD RV PARK  </P> <P> An Ojai rancher has said he will drop his four-year effort to build a 60-space  recreational vehicle park on five acres of agricultural land on the Santa Clara  River near Santa Paula.  </P> <P> "My wife said I was crazy to try this and that I should invest in CDs," Ozzie  Osborn said at a hearing earlier this week.  </P> <P> "So that's what I'm going to do."  </P> <P> Osborn said he is dropping plans to build the RV park just south of Santa Paula  on South Mountain Road because of continuing opposition to the project from  nearby residents and the county's lengthy environmental review.  </P> <P> His announcement came during a meeting Wednesday of the county's Environmental  Report Review Committee.  </P> <P> Osborn said he lost interest in the project last September when the committee  decided his original proposal to include a small golf course would need a full  environmental impact report. Osborn reapplied to build only the RV park.  Wednesday, four South Mountain Road residents objected to the project. THIA  BELL  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with retired Brigadier General David Mark by </F> Jeremy Skiss in London; date not given; from the "Focus on  Africa" program -- first paragraph is announcer's introduction]    [Text] The military government in Nigeria has accused a  retired general of threatening the country's stability. The man  at the center of the controversy is former Brigadier General  David Mark, one of the officers who backed the coup which  brought General Abacha to power last November. In an interview  in NEWSWATCH magazine last week, Gen. Mark accused the ruling  council of having a hidden agenda and of planning to stay in  power for another five years instead of one year as agreed  before the coup. Since the coup, Gen. Mark has been retired  early from the Armed Forces and is now living in London. When  he came into the studio, Jeremy Skiss put it to him that he has  gone public because of bitterness over the way he had been  treated by his superiors.    [Begin recording] [Mark] That certainly is not true because  I  don't have to be bitter about it. I haven't said anything  personal against Abacha or any other person in the  administration. I have simply said we agreed on a program and  they should release that program and follow it religiously.    [Skiss] So do you think you were retired because you were  seen as an ally of General Babangida? You were one of  Babangida's boys.    [Mark] Far from that; so was Abacha, if there is anything  like that. Abacha was Babangida's right-hand man. But even if  that is the case, why can't this administration come up with a  timetable showing when they are going to hand over. They are  working on a constitutional conference; they are going to elect  people into that constitutional conference; they are going to  accommodate the elected members in the constitutional conference  in Abuja. They haven't built the houses in Abuja yet. You  don't build a house overnight. Those who are going to be elected  don't even know the format of the election yet and the  constitutional conference is going to be designed to stay some  time before they start. At the end of that constitutional  conference, we are going to have an election. There is no  program, so it is common sense to see the way it is going. It  doesn't take a genius to understand that.    [Skiss] The government has criticized the interview you gave  to NEWSWATCH in saying it's all part of a plot to destabilize  the Abacha government. Would you agree with that?    [Mark] Nobody wants to do Abacha government that favor. It  will be a favor to that administration to destabilize it.  Nobody wants to do them that favor. They should be honorable  enough to quit on their own. Nobody would like to do them that  favor.    [Skiss] Now, since you gave the interview the editor of  NEWSWATCH has been detained. What do you say to the Abacha  government: Release him immediately?    [Mark] Well, this is the beginning of dictatorship and that  is how dictators start. They start first by dealing with  journalists. They are their first victims. I have accepted and  I gave an interview. Nobody is challenging the contents of the  interview I have given. People are skirting round it. The  government is skirting round it. They haven't addressed one  single issue that I raised in my interview because those were  simple facts, the honest truth.    [Skiss] But the editor was arrested. Would you be willing to  go back to Nigeria and swap places with the editor?    [Mark] I am going back on the 30th of May because my program  here.... [pauses] I am going to finish what I have come to do by  the 30th and I've booked a flight to go back. I certainly would  not run away from Nigeria, I would be the last person to.    [Skiss] Some people would say that this interview is the  beginning of your political career; your military career is now  over; you are going to launch a political career. Is that right?    [Mark] I have no intention whatsoever of playing politics? I  don't have that intention.    [Skiss] But you played politics before?    [Mark] I haven't. I have never played politics.    [Skiss] Well, when Abacha took over, that is what I call  playing politics.    [Mark] Well, I am a patriotic Nigerian and I will go for  anything that will ensure the goodness of that country so if  what we did was barely to.... [pauses] I mean, was just to make  sure that we got the best for Nigeria, if you call that  politics, yes, but otherwise I have no desire whatsoever to go  into politics. [end recording]</p>

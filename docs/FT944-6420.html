			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (18): 'Still pushing strongly' - Colleagues Direct Marketing One industry which has expanded in Bristol and the west of England is direct mail, as exemplified by Colleagues Direct Marketing, the award-winning private company based in Bath, writes Roland Adburgham. Mr James Robson, chairman of Colleagues, which he and his wife started in the city in 1987, has grown rapidly to have a likely turnover this year of Pounds 40m, a leap of Pounds 12m on the previous year. It is, he says, 'still pushing very strongly' and he expects sales to reach Pounds 57m next year. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 2m in 1993 are targeted to reach just over Pounds 3m this year. 'We have made a profit from day one,' says Mr Robson, 'and it has risen by leaps and bounds.' There are plans, subject to market conditions, to float the company on the stock exchange. Mr Robson and his co-directors have a controlling interest in the company, but all 80 employees are shareholders. 'The sense of participation in the company is very important.' Charterhouse, the venture capital group, has a 20 per cent stake. Colleagues specialises in high-volume direct mail for clients such as Barclaycard, British Telecom, Reader's Digest, Sun Life, Vernons Pools and leading charities. The company offers a service of 'recruitment activity' - finding potential customers - and designs and organises mail-shots and analyses the response. Mr Robson attributes Colleagues' expansion, despite the recession, to a combination of two factors. Companies have become less indiscriminate in their advertising and are increasing their use of direct mail to have a more targeted approach, giving better value for money. Secondly, there are new clients which have never previously used direct mail. The unusual name of Colleagues was chosen to reflect that 'a company is a company - not one or two egos - and we want to work with our clients almost as if we were on their payrolls. 'Our clients see us as genuine partners - more as colleagues than as an agency.' Mr Robson says that both he and his wife have always felt as if the west country were their natural home. 'Bath has been an excellent choice for us. It has worked very well. The only problem is the great difficulty in finding office accommodation to match our growth - we are now in three buildings.'</p>

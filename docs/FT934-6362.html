			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Volvo shareholder deals blow to merger Volvo's struggle to win approval for the planned merger of its car and truck operations with France's Renault suffered a serious blow yesterday when the first institutional shareholder to declare a final position said it would vote against the deal. Although the so-called Fifth Fund state pension fund holds only 1.3 per cent of Volvo's voting capital, its rejection indicated that Volvo's intensive effort to overcome objections by large Swedish shareholders had failed. Meanwhile, Mr Louis Schwei-tzer, Renault chairman, told the FT that a rejection of the planned merger would damage existing co-operation between Volvo and Renault. 'The momentum would disappear,' he said. He added that the disruption to the merger process had already destabilised efforts to build a joint management organisation. Mr Schweitzer stressed the industrial logic of the proposed merger. The cost savings which would result through joint purchasing, research and development and economies of scale would strengthen the two companies' car and truck operations. The outcome of a vote by Volvo shareholders on December 7 may now swing on a decision expected today from another state pension group, the Fourth Fund. It is Volvo's second-largest shareholder after Renault, with 7.5 per cent of the voting capital against the French group's 10 per cent. Mr Bert Ekstrom, chief executive of the Fifth Fund, said the fund rejected the merger because of uncertainties over the values implied in the agreement, which proposes a 35 per cent share for Volvo in the merged company. He said the fund - which is governed by trade union, local government and state industry representatives - was also sceptical about French commitments to privatise Renault, in spite of assurances from Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, on the timing of the privatisation and on the golden share that France intends to hold in the merged company.

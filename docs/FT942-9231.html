			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Dutch auction Does it make sense to privatise a telecoms operator in tandem with a post office? The Netherlands thinks so. KPN, whose preliminary prospectus was published yesterday, combines both telephone and postal services. Part of the thinking is that steady profits from PTT Post will help PTT Telecom in its more volatile market. PTT Post is in better shape than most European post offices. It is not only profitable but has been making inroads into foreign markets by offering bulk remailing services - to the chagrin of Britain's Post Office. Even so, the combination with PTT Telecom is unfortunate. Telecommunications is viewed by most international investors as the more exciting industry, so the association with PTT Post may drag down KPN's share price. Equally, the uniqueness of a quoted postal company would have been enhanced if it had been floated separately. That apart, the KPN flotation looks like being a success. The indicative price range of Fl 46 to Fl 52 seems conservative on most of the yardsticks used to value international telecoms stocks. KPN's prospective price-earnings ratio of 12 compares with 17 at recently privatised Tele Danmark and 13 at BT. Equally, the prospective yield of 4.5 is higher than Tele Danmark's 3.6, though lower than BT's 5.7. Moreover, KPN's regulatory climate is fairly benign. Plans to license a second Dutch telecoms operator are making only slow progress. Meanwhile, PTT Telecom's tariffs are allowed to rise in line with inflation. BT, by contrast, not only faces an army of competitors but is required to cut its prices by the inflation rate minus 7.5 percentage points.</p>

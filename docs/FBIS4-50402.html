			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Beijing Briefing" by Geoffrey Crothall] </F>   [Text] China's economic czar Zhu Rongji is often portrayed  as a stern, tough-minded politician, totally preoccupied with  the arduous task of getting to grips with China's economic  problems. However, students at Beijing's prestigious Qinghua  University saw the lighter side of the executive Vice-Premier a  few weeks ago when he gave a speech at the university's economic  management institute.    Mr Zhu, who happens to be president of the institute as well  as governor of the People's Bank of China and a member of the  politburo's standing committee, demonstrated that he not only  had a detailed and comprehensive understanding of China's  economic and financial system, but also a sense of humour. In  discussing China's complex tax reforms which are being  implemented this year, Mr Zhu noted that changing the tax system  was the "most unpopular" and potentially dangerous of all  economic reforms.    "Three Japanese governments have fallen because of attempts  to reform the taxation system. In Britain, Mrs [Margaret]  Thatcher was forced out because of the poll tax and I myself  have already started preparing for my own demise," he said.  "However, at the moment things are looking good and no major  problems have emerged," he added, much to the relief of his fans  in the audience.    In a nearly two-hour address, regularly interrupted by  enthusiastic bursts of applause, Mr Zhu covered everything from  the stock market to loss-making enterprises and financial reform  and even found time to throw in a few jokes. For example, have  you heard the one about the Soviet financial system? "Our old  financial system was transplanted here from the old Soviet Union  and the main characteristic of that system's accounting methods  was that you could never actually be sure whether you had made  money or lost money," Mr Zhu said.    On a more serious note, the Vice-Premier quickly pointed out  that China's accounting system was rapidly being brought in line  with international standards. Some Western observers may have  found this last comment rather more amusing but no one at  Qinghua appeared to be laughing. In spite of the jokes, Mr Zhu  was clearly not amused with the way many enterprise managers  were blindly climbing on board the stock bandwagon.    "Several enterprises leaders are not concentrating on  improving management, but are thinking up all sorts of schemes  to transform their business into a stock holding company," Mr  Zhu said. "The result is the blind expansion of production,  Ieading to an oversupply of products and huge amounts of waste,"  he added.</p>

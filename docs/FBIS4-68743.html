			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Dyshev: "A War Against Taxes Is Going on"] </F>   [Text] An extraordinary event and, probably, not even on an  oblast scale occurred in nice provincial Vologda. However, the  information on it in newspapers was very scant and contradictory.    At 11:30 on 11 April a large group of people, which  represented the popular movement in Vologda and the city's  entrepreneurial circles, gathered near the building of the  Oblast Tax Inspectorate and the Administration of the Russian  Federation Tax Police Department in Vologda Oblast. Mikhail  Surov, deputy of the Oblast Legislative Assembly, headed this  gathering. He was the initiator of the preparation of a petition  on a change in federal tax laws and decrees of the oblast  administration on local taxation. With this document those  gathered resolutely headed for the building.    The most interesting thing began then and there. The part of  the building that belonged to the tax inspectorate and to the  police was under guard. The ordinary passage regime existed  there, about which two workers warned those that burst into it.  They proposed that the petition be handed over to the authorized  person.    Next we will refer to the testimony of Lt. Col. Militia  Vladimir Aleynikov, chief of the Division for the Protection of  Public Order of the Administration of Internal Affairs in the  City of Vologda: "When they approached the building, the doors  were open. No chain of guards blocked the road on the steps, as  some newspapers wrote. I was the last to enter the building.  People began to push one another, women looked out of offices,  some shouted, and hands were already `flying' in front. I rushed  there, shouting: `What are you doing? Be human!' I confronted  Surov's group. Only three people from the police in uniforms  remained behind me..." The gathering and the subsequent  "assault" were filmed by six(!) videocameras: [by the  videocamera of] an expert from the Administration of Internal  Affairs, [by the videocamera of] a worker at the Administration  of the Tax Police Department, and by four cameras of  entrepreneurs. Later this entire, not very appealing, action was  shown on local television and in Mr. Surov's explanation was  understood as a fight for the happiness and well-being of simple  folk.    Naturally, the author of these lines also became acquainted  with the video newsreel and met with officers at the  Administration of the Tax Police Department. Lt. Oleg B. said  that, together with Capt. Valeriy P., he tried to accompany the  delegation and to clarify whether there was a permit for  videofilming. However, Mr. Surov with his assistants roughly  pushed them away and a crowd surged behind them. Other workers  were also subjected to beating and physical pressure. Two beat  up Capt. Oleg I. from the Physical Protection Division (which is  seen well from the recording), after which he was taken to the  hospital with a brain concussion.    The crowd of 50 people kept the building under siege for  about 1 hour. Surov, like a true military leader, summoned in an  emphatic manner "support groups" over the radio-telephone and  the execution of orders was reported to him. Police workers were  shamelessly and impudently pressured and threatened and  unprintable obscene language was hurled at them. Here are only  some retorts recorded by me during the viewing of the film.  Vladimir Kirillov: "We will identify all of you at home! All of  you are photographed. If you want to live in peace...  (illegible)." Surov: "Enough of eating and drinking with our  money!"    In the end with militia support a semblance of common  language was found with the overexcited "delegates." Five of  them headed by Surov were permitted to pass for a meeting with  Vladimir Zolotov, chief of the Administration of the Tax Police  Department in Vologda Oblast. A press-conference for the city's  entrepreneurs was held on the same day. This time there were no  skirmishes.    On 12 April in connection with the breach of public order  the  City Administration of Internal Affairs instituted criminal  proceedings on the basis of Article 206, Part II, of the Russian  Federation Criminal Code--malicious hooliganism (provides for  imprisonment for a period of 1 to 5 years).    Now something about the personality of the organizer  himself.  Mikhail Surov is one of the city's richest entrepreneurs. His  firm, Provintsial, has stores, a canning line, a hotel, and a  tourist complex, as well as many other things. Together with his  associates he declared war on the "Caucasians" in Vologda and,  in practice, was able to drive them out. During popular open-air  festivals Mikhail Vasilyevich on a true merchant's scale treats  people to free drinks and candy. Having become a state figure, a  member of the Oblast Legislative Assembly, Mr. Surov ever more  frequently speaks about the revival of Russia and of the city.  According to him, the road to this lies in an uncompromising  fight against tax structures.    The sociopolitical and humanitarian activity of Surov and of  the political council of the popular movement in Vologda is only  the visible part of the iceberg. The invisible part, with its  entire mass, represents only banal mercenary interests,  naturally, "in preservation and increase." In 1992-1993 Mikhail  Surov was forced to pay taxes of several million rubles. He  tried to enter into "friendly" relations with representatives of  tax bodies, but nothing came of this. Quite recently he had to  pay an even bigger sum. Surov sent to the tax inspectorate in  Vologodskiy Rayon a petition to have the added-value tax on  export deliveries of cranberries and hides returned to him. An  additional check was needed. Some documents evoked doubts:  Accounting at the enterprise was quite entangled. And then  followed the well-known action by the city's merchants. By the  way, it is not the first in Vologda's history. A similar action  occurred on 12 August 1993. Participants picketed the building  of the City State Tax Inspectorate, carried posters with  insulting texts, and burned documents of the tax inspectorate.  Entrepreneurs with a criminal past were among the initiators.  Incidentally, Surov himself was convicted twice. In all, he  spent 7 years in a hard labor colony.    Tax services in Vologda are under severe pressure. Every  opportunity is utilized to discredit Veniyamin Alekseyev, chief  of the Oblast State Tax Inspectorate. Over a period of 2 years,  not without the influence of certain forces, the oblast  administration raised the question of dismissing him, although  there were no grounds for this. Commercial structures tried to  involve Alekseyev's son in the performance of illegal  transactions. Knocked out windows in the office and notes with  threats on the door have already become the norm. Local  merchants promised to publicly burn the effigy of the chief of  the tax inspectorate.    In March 1994 during a check of the Provintsial Enterprise  Mikhail Surov tried to detain Lieutenant Stepanov, a tax police  worker, justifying this by the fact that his identification card  was forged. After 10 minutes an operational physical protection  group arrived at the office and, thus, the provocation was  stopped.    It seems that present tax legislation suits no one: neither  the state, owing to its low efficiency; nor the taxpayer, owing  to its confusion and the large tax percentage; finally, nor tax  bodies, owing to criminal "production costs."    Gennadiy Khripel, chairman of the Legislative Assembly in  Vologda Oblast, also believes that the demands of local  taxpayers are quite reasonable, although most of them are sent  to the wrong address. It is not for local tax bodies to change  the laws! And so, was the "deputation" guided by a simple soul  and ignorance? Alas, the action had quite a clear and tough  goal: To intimidate inspectors and the tax police and to dictate  its terms and, naturally, the amount of the suitable tax. In the  city many realize this perfectly well.    However, Vologda businessmen (naturally, not all) are not  alone in their "holy hatred." More than 100 cases of violent and  other wrongful acts against tax bodies, employees, and their  family members were recorded throughout Russia in 1993 alone.  They include nine cases of arson, explosions, and firing at  premises of the State Tax Inspectorate; 15 cases of arson,  firing, and explosions at employees' private property; nine  bodily injuries were inflicted; 32 threats of physical reprisal  and insults were made; two cases of compromise; four cases of  the use of arms. Arson at buildings of the State Tax  Inspectorate was carried out in cities of Monchegorsk, Ob,  Iskitim, Sarapul, and Murom. An attempt to set fire to the  private home of the chief of the Rayon State Tax Inspectorate in  the City of Iskitim was foiled. A homemade explosive device  exploded under the gasoline tank of the official car belonging  to the deputy chief of the State Tax Inspectorate in Kurgan  Oblast. In Pskov Oblast alone the number of such wrongful acts  doubled as compared with 1992.    I left Vologda and at parting the lads in camouflage  uniforms  said: "If similar things are repeated, we will act in a tougher  and more decisive manner, including the use of arms, as the Law  on Tax Police specifies."</p>

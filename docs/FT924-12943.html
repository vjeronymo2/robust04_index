			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Arts: A painter who plays with perspectives - William Packer reviews the work of John Wonnacott JOHN WONNACOTT is as ambitious a painter as any currently at work in England, both in the scale of his paintings and the complexity of the formal problems which he sets himself. He is also remarkably prolific. The large upper gallery and the stairs at Agnew's is now filled with the work he has done in the past two years. His subjects embrace the wide beachscapes of his home at Leigh-on-Sea, in Essex, and interiors at times no less extensive. Recent commissions include a portrait of the late chairman of British Caledonian, Sir Adam Thompson, high on a gangway above an aircraft-building workshop, for the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, and a substantial sequence of paintings of the Naval refit dockyard at Devonport, initiated by the Imperial War Museum. As a painter of the technological landscape, whether of a factory or a radio-telescope, he is on his own. But for all its variety and grandiosity, the essential subject of the work now on show is altogether more consistent and mundane. One of the largest canvases in the show, and one moreover that is entirely characteristic of the whole, depicts no aircraft hangar, no battleship, no crane or telescope, but only a standard easel set in the centre of the studio, and on it a mirror in which the artist sees himself. The easel reaches up into the ceiling void, to probe and define the space itself. Below, the easel-legs and palette-stool fall away by the pictorial logic of the forced, vertiginous perspective. And in the centre sit the mirror and the artist, the one a flat plane within the real, perceived space of the room, the other within the mirror's own proposed, reflected space - surface upon surface, space within space. Wonnacott's subject is the space itself, the space occupied and animated by object or figure, and realised by all the devices of perspective, paint and line. His perspectives are more often forced than not, which is to say that rather than being eased apart and accommodated, the several vanishing points are accepted as they are, their pictorial logic worked through to a conclusion. As with the monocular fish-eye lens of the camera, the system rigorously applied leads to a certain distortion. The assumption is easily made, too easily in Wonnacotts's case, of a reliance upon such photographic reference. But there is nothing here of photo-realism. The binocular complexity is all too evident, the scrutiny direct and unmistakeable, the visual solution entirely achieved by hand and eye working together at the brush's end. The long sequence of self-portraits give the game away, if game it is, for there is no escape from the self-portrait if the artist is to be honest with himself and his work. Wonnacott's self-portraits by now supply a substantial oeuvre in themselves, and are at least as fine as anything else he does. There is no sign here that the supply is about to fail. Two other current shows require a mention. I reviewed Bridget Riley's Hayward show at length some two weeks ago, and there is no need now to rehearse those favourable arguments. All I will say is that her works on paper now at Karsten Schubert are as authoritative and beautiful as any of their larger relations across the river. At Gimpel Fils, Three Score And Ten celebrates Albert Irvin's 70th birthday. He is a painter quite as remarkable for his energy as for his formal invention and technical command. And he too is properly ambitious, if only to celebrate truly in his turn the unfailing visual thrill to be had in the experience of paint and colour. His is a bravura abstract expressionism to lift the heart. John Wonnacott: Agnew's, 43 Old Bond Street W1, until November 6; Albert Irvin: Gimpel Fils, 30 Davies Street W1, until November 21; Bridget Riley: Karsten Schubert, 85 Charlotte Street W1, until November 14.</p>

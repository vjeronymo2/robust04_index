			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Hills warns Tokyo of 'actions' in chip row MRS Carla Hills, US trade representative, yesterday put Tokyo on notice the US will take 'actions' if Japanese companies do not increase their purchases of foreign semiconductors. A special US inter-agency review says Japan is failing to improve market access for foreign chip suppliers. Previous efforts have pushed the foreign share to about 14.6 per cent, but it has stayed 'flat' since the third quarter of 1991. The 1991 US-Japanese Semiconductor Arrangement acknowledged the US industry 'expectation' that foreign share would grow to over 20 per cent by end-1992. Japanese government and industry 'have it in their power to correct insufficient progress and ensure successful implementation of the promising plan to expand market access announced in June by US and Japanese industry,' Mrs Hills said. 'If substantial improvement is not achieved, we will take extra actions, as necessary, to fulfil the terms of the Arrangement.' The June plan outlined specific steps to raise foreign sales: Japan's 10 biggest electronics companies agreed to give foreign suppliers advance information on plans for chip purchases in the third and fourth quarters of 1992. Mrs Hills said it was too early to assess results of that agreement. A Semiconductor Industry Association official said 'early reviews showed the effort 'is not succeeding'. Many Japanese fear the review is an attempt to prepare for sanctions before the November presidential election so the administration can show its resolve in trade rows. Mrs Hills may announce retaliation before the five-year pact expires, but she may now just be sabre-rattling. The accord is seen by some as a test of the efficacy of 'managed trade' pacts. The SIA said: 'You can't actually force people to buy chips, but you can indicate it is in everyone's interest for users to look outside Japan for semiconductors.'</p>

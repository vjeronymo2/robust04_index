			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 436] </F>   [Text] Vilnius, Feb 14, ELTA -- Russian military transit  through Lithuania, legalized by the agreement, equals to the  presence of Russian military forces in the Lithuanian territory,  the opposition leader Vytautas Landsbergis told a news  conference.    In case of such agreement an ex-territorial corridor would  be  created and a number of rights and guarantees ensured for  Russia, Landsbergis noted.    He emphasized that lately the political and economic crisis  had been aggravated in Kaliningrad enclave. Thus, deep  concentration of Russian military forces there represents danger  for Lithuania.    Landsbergis noted that the former Lithuanian government  constantly raised questions on the demilitarization of  Kaliningrad enclave. President Brazauskas raised this question  at the United Nations as well. It would be paradoxical that  Lithuania would add to the militarization of the enclave now,  which would become a fact if Lithuania signed the agreement on  the military transit.    Landsbergis reproached the Lithuanian Government that it did  not express its protest against Russia ignoring the Helsinki  agreements signed in 1992. The agreements say that a foreign  army can not be present in the territory of any state which does  not give its agreement on it.    Landsbergis thinks that the best way out would be to divert  Russian military transit through territories of other states,  like it happens now with the passanger trains. Any other  agreements represent danger for Lithuania despite the presence  of any international monitors which will be invited to Lithuania.</p>

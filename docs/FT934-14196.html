			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (3): This is the one to match / Company profile of Parametric Technology WHEN A company boosts sales from Dollars 11m in 1989 to nearly Dollars 87m last year, and roughly doubles its net profits every year, it is easy to see why it captures many of the superlatives regularly dished out by observers of its industry and financial analysts. Such is the case with Massachusetts-based Parametric Technology, which over the past five years has emerged from nowhere to claim leadership in the mechanical design automation industry - and has become one of the darlings of Wall Street in the process. In July, the company reported a 101 per cent surge in third-quarter earnings to Dollars 11.4m. Its market capitalisation exceeds Dollars 2bn and Mr Steven Walske, president and chief executive, says: 'We continue to be the driving force in the market place for high-end mechanical design automation software products.' Independent observers enthuse similarly. The Cad Report, an industry newsletter, says Parametric's Pro/Engineer family of software products has become the most attractive system for three-dimensional mechanical design, and adds that the company's breathtaking growth should not surprise anyone. The object of all this adulation is a company formed in 1985 by Mr Sam Geisberg. Recognising earlier than many how things were going in the Cadcam industry, Mr Geisberg wanted to develop a new Cadcam system that was not only technologically innovative in itself but also not restricted to any particular hardware. The first Pro/Engineer was launched in 1988 and is now a family of about 27 software modules ranging from conceptual design to manufacturing. The underlying business strategy is to concentrate on mechanical design-through-manufacturing, and to set the pace through 'technological leadership, hardware independence, aggressive price/performance, worldwide distribution and extensive customer support'. In practice, this means that Parametric sells only software, which runs on all the major Unix platforms including the latest releases from Sun, Hewlett-Packard, Silicon Graphics, DEC and IBM. At the CIM '93 show at Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre, it will be running Pro/Engineer on a Compaq 486-based Deskpro 66M under Windows HT, Microsoft's new 32-bit operating system. It also means regular product enhancements - two big releases each year compared with one for many of its rivals. Release 11 of Pro/Engineer was made this May, and introduced two new software products: Pro/Dieface, which provides stamping designers with the tools to define complex components used in the manufacture of car body panels and other 'deep drawn' products; and Pro/PDM (Parametric Design Manager), which manages the development and support of large-scale parametric designs and traditional engineering data. And then there is the core product itself, Pro/Engineer. This uses a unique, single data structure which, says Parametric, improves interaction among engineers by allowing all members of the product development team to work on the design simultaneously. It also uses 'parametric design,' which means that when a dimension such as a diameter is changed, the software works out on its own how much to change the rest of the product accordingly. According to The Cad Report, other advantages of Pro/Engineer are that it is visually attractive, has menu terms that mean something to engineers and is reasonably priced. Competitors really began to take notice of Parametric last year when it announced that Caterpillar, the world's largest construction equipment group, had ordered 2,000 'seats' - the term used in the industry for copies of the software - in what is believed to be the biggest single order ever received by a Cadcam company. Cummins Engine also said it would progressively standardise on Pro/Engineer, and Toyota and Ford placed significant orders. To make the most of its opportunities, Parametric is now aggressively expanding outside the US. Its international sales grew by 80 per cent last year. In Europe, it has rapidly expanded its presence in the past two years, and sales more than doubled last year following heavy investments to broaden the company's direct sales and support operations throughout the continent. In an interview earlier this year, Mr Louis Volpe, Parametric's senior vice-president for marketing and operations, said the company was targeting electronics packaging and automotive companies in Europe. It hoped to use the new Pro/Dieface software as a way to expand its presence in the automotive industry. But Mr Volpe also made clear that Parametric attaches a high priority to Asia. Over the next 10 years, it wants to achieve a broad balance between its US, European and Asian turnover. Independent distribution channels have been established throughout the region and a wholly-owned business subsidiary established in Japan, seen as the biggest market opportunity in Asia. Parametric is keen to exploit the Japanese move from two-dimensional to three- dimensional mechanical design, where - surprisingly, perhaps - the country lags behind developments in Europe and the US. Some of Parametric's recent orders bear witness to the developing global strategy. In August, it announced a significant order from British Aerospace Defence for seats of Pro/Engineer for the Lostock, Lancs, and Stevenage, Herts sites of the UK company's Dynamics Division. Earlier in the year, it won an order for more than 100 seats from Groupe Schneider, the French industrial and electrical products group. It also picked up one of the largest Cadcam contracts placed by an Indian company - from Tata Engineering and Locomotive (Telco), which makes cars, trucks and construction equipment. Inevitably, Parametric's surge raises questions about how long the growth can continue. Parametric does not have the diversity of several competitors whose products go a long way beyond mechanical design-to-manufacturing. Thus, it could be said to have all its eggs in one basket. However, according to Mr Walske and Mr Geisberg in the company's 1992 annual report: 'The size of our market opportunity remains great. There are an estimated 3m to 5m engineers, designers and drafting professionals worldwide who could benefit from mechanical design automation software such as Pro/Engineer.' The hype surrounding Parametric has set it up as the one to match in its chosen market. But, according to Engineering Automation Report last October, the company is not 'a short-term phenomenon, destined to flame out as soon as the competition gets its act together. This company is here for the long haul.' That is backed up by Mr Jeffry Canin, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. 'I am very confident that Parametric will grow faster than the mechanical design automation market as a whole,' he says. But it looks as if further doubling of net earnings could be a tall order, as Mr Canin adds a cautionary note: the Dollars 1.8bn MDA market worldwide is growing only at 11-12 per cent a year, and is maturing. Earnings per share in the year just ended will virtually have doubled, he says, but the rise in 1993-94 could be a mere 43 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 21 Apr--According to First Deputy Defense  Minister Jerzy Milewski, the Polish Army must adapt itself to  joint actions with the NATO states' armies. When Poland becomes  a member of NATO, its entire Army or a part of it may find  itself under foreign command, Milewski said today during a  meeting with journalists in Warsaw on Poland's defense policy.    Milewski and other high-ranking representatives of the  National Defense Ministry emphasized that Poland will not be  able to defend itself in anything greater than a local conflict.  According to them, there is no great threat of an outbreak of a  global conflict or a great conventional war in Europe today.</p>

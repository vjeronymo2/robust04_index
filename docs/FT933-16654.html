			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Letter: Role for small shareholder Sir, As this company's logo featured prominently at the head of Tony Jackson's article, 'Voice of the little guy: the small shareholder's right to speak' (June 21), may I comment on our attitude towards small shareholders, which is certainly not one of antipathy. In recent years, our AGM has seen many questions, and some disruption, by anti-apartheid activists, but we would not share the description of them, or activists generally, as cranks. Far from attempting, or wanting, to stifle debate, successive chairmen have believed that the company has had good counter-arguments to present. Our AGM is not tightly controlled - although we hope it is run in a businesslike manner - and shareholders are free to ask any question relating to the company's affairs, without notice. Compared with their total number, few private shareholders attend the AGM, many no doubt for reasons of time and distance; others perhaps are not attracted by its formality. Therefore, since 1977, Shell Transport has each year arranged informal meetings for shareholders around the country which provide the opportunity to meet and question senior executives. They have proved very popular. Also, each shareholder receives an annual chairman's bulletin and, whenever we can, we invite shareholders to visit Shell installations. For example, in May a Shell tanker berthed for several days in the Mersey after taking part in the Royal Review to commemorate the Battle of the Atlantic. In four days, more than 7,000 shareholders and their guests visited the vessel. We believe that the private individual shareholder has an important role to play in corporate governance. We try to bring the shareholder and the company closer together. J A Cunliffe, secretary, Shell Transport and Trading Company. Shell Centre, London SE1 7NA</p>

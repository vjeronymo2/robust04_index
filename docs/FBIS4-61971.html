			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "In Brief" rubric: "Energy </F> Debt Mounting"]    [Text] A situation close to disastrous has taken shape in  Kazakhstan's fuel and energy complex. Its imported fuel debts  have topped $117 million. Reporting this, the Republic's  business newspaper PANORAMA gives the list of Kazakhstan's  energy creditors, which are Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan], Turkmenistan,  Uzbekistan, and Russia. The lion's share of the debts falls on  the Uzbek side: Kazakhstan owes it more than $100 million for  the use of natural gas and electricity.</p>

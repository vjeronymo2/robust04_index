			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Sketch by Manet sold for Pounds 4.4m 'Un Bar Aux Folies Bergere', not Manet's famous painting in the Courtauld Institute, London, but his preliminary sketch, which shows a young barmaid as obviously up for sale as her merchandise, sold for Pounds 4.4m at Sotheby's last night, Antony Thorncroft writes. It was one of two highlights that ensured the success of the auction of Impressionist and Modern pictures and suggested that the recession might finally be coming to an end in this crucial, high-priced sector of the arts market. The Manet, which had been in a private Dutch collection since the 1920s, had been forecast to sell for Pounds 3m. The other important lot, one of the 10 versions of poplars painted by Monet in 1891, did even better, selling for Pounds 4.84m. This compares well with the price paid for the last picture of poplars from the series which appeared at auction in New York during the boom of the late 1980s and sold for a similar sum. The auction totalled Pounds 19.83m and was a very reasonable 78 per cent sold by value.</p>

			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON CALIFORNIA: NOT THE TIME TO BUG OUT OF MEDFLY WAR  </P> <P> Every night the choppers rise from their landing pads and spread across the  L.A. Basin. Squadrons of them, sortie after sortie, all loaded with liquid  death for the Medfly. Every night for five months now they've poured malathion  from the skies, trying -- entomologically speaking -- to bomb the Medfly back  to the Stone Age.  </P> <P> We accept this annual war in California. It is one of the peculiarities of life  here that we can wake up in the middle of the night, hear the whump whump of  the choppers overhead, and know immediately what's happening. Just one more  layer of sticky poison coating the neighborhood. One more night of carpet  bombing.  </P> <P> We accept it, I think, because we understand the stakes involved. The domino  theory probably was hogwash when it came to the commies, but it's not hogwash  with the Medfly, or the Oriental fruit fly or the Mex fly. If any of those  creatures establish a firm beachhead in the L.A. Basin, the San Joaquin Valley  and all of California agriculture surely will be next.  </P> <P> And we accept it for another reason: This war has always ended in victory. The  chopper season arrived, the malathion went down, and the Medfly died. It is a  strategy that worked.  </P> <P> Except this year. For reasons that no one understands, the war is going badly  this year. Very badly. We have escalated our response, sending more and more  choppers into the night sky, expanding the war zone week after week. Now we  find ourselves fighting over a huge territory, 300 square miles, and still the  Medfly has not succumbed.  </P> <P> All this became clear last week when some of the top Medfly scientists decided  to go public with their fear that the war in L.A. may be unwinnable. In a story  by Times reporter Maura Dolan, a UC Berkeley entomologist expressed his view  this simply: "I don't think they will be able to (eradicate)."  </P> <P> A scientist from out of state agreed and added this: "Once you have an  established population -- and I would say the evidence in L.A. is that it is  pretty well established -- it (eradication) is very unlikely."  </P> <P> These scientists are outside the program. Inside the program, as might be  expected, you still get optimism of the light-at-the-end- of-the-tunnel  variety. One of the inside scientists, when asked if the Medfly would be  vanquished by next autumn, replied, "Possibly."  </P> <P> Next autumn. That's eight, nine months from now. By then the air war will be  more than a year old; it will have spanned two Medfly seasons. Some  neighborhoods will have been sprayed a dozen, two dozen, times. The toll on  humans will be uncertain and unknown, but the toll on other creatures such as  ladybugs, butterflies and honey bees will be serious. This is not a benign war,  and that reality is starting to sink in.  </P> <P> So, with the war going badly, with the ladybugs and butterflies dying, it would  be easy to heap scorn on the commanders of the spraying war. You could argue  that L.A. has paid too high a price to protect the farmers of the San Joaquin.  Let the farmers fight their own war, you could say. Let the dominoes fall.  </P> <P> You could say that, but you shouldn't. If we lose the air war in L.A., all of  California will be caught in a true nightmare. Here in the Basin, a permanent  infestation would mean a permanent war. Not an air war, perhaps, but a war in  every back yard where there are fruit trees. Over the years more malathion  would be sprayed by homeowners than is coming now from the choppers.  </P> <P> And a permanent infestation in the San Joaquin would mean a permanent taint on  California produce. Apples, pears, peaches, plums, grapes -- everything would  be run through fumigators before it left the state and everything would be  suspect. Make just one mistake and a nervous country like Japan would shut its  doors to California farm products as it did during the 1981 Medfly war. It cost  $100 million that time and it lasted only a few months.  </P> <P> It would be a good idea, then, to win this war. That means we have to keep the  choppers in the air whether or not things look shaky. And if we win this time,  there is reason to believe future battles may be easier. The government is  beefing up its production of sterile fruit flies and within two years they will  be available as substitutes for much of the spraying.  </P> <P> But, as with Vietnam, the generals of the bug war are facing an erosion of  public will. It's my guess that L.A. will not tolerate aerial poisons from now  till autumn. The generals don't have that much time. They must show some  progress, show they can win, and show it soon. Or get ready for a hasty retreat  from the onrushing insect hordes.  </P></p>

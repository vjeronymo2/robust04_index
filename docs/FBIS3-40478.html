This is due to the fact that the Russian government is  taking steps that can take the place of ratification by the  Russian parliament of the agreement concerning establishment of  the center, which has been delayed by a conflict between the  reformist and conservative factions. These steps will be  completed in November and the agreement is expected to become  effective 1 month after that. Once the center begins operation,  it is expected to spur conversion of Russia from a military to  civil state and contribute greatly to global security. Research  themes for the center already are being studied by  representatives of all the countries, and the center finally is  about to be realized, 1 year and 8 months after it was  conceptualized. The international S&amp;T center will be  established  with the goal of preventing the proliferation of nuclear related  technology that would result if scientists and technicians that  were involved in weapons of mass destruction such as nuclear,  biological and chemical weapons and their delivery were to pour  out to other countries because of the domestic economic and  social chaos caused by the breakup of the former Soviet Union.  These scientists and technicians will be given research projects  and there will be joint research and technology and knowhow  sharing.    The concept of the center was proposed by the United States,  Germany and Russia in February 1992. Japan decided to  participate in March of the same year. Germany's participation  evolved into EC participation, and the center became a  quadrilateral joint project. Also, in April, Japan announced  that it would contribute $20 million over 2 years; the United  States will contribute $25 million, the EC 20 million European  currency units (ECU; equal to $24 million), and Russia will  provide the facilities. In November, the four parties signed the  agreement to establish the center; Japan and the United States  ratified the agreement on the same day, and EC ratification came  thereafter.    As for Japan, the Foreign Ministry, MITI and the Science and  Technology Agency (STA) each has been allocated $3 million from  the FY93 budget to support research at the center to convert  nuclear related technology to power generation technology. Also,  if the center is established, the Foreign Ministry's deputy  director general for arms control and scientific affairs Hayashi  will serve as an executive director and a senior official of the  STA will serve as a deputy secretary general of the center to  provide active support to the management of the center.</p>

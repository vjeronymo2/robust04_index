			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SANTA CLARITA TO CONSIDER DAY-LABORER CRACKDOWN;  </P> <P> PLAN IS 'HORRENDOUS,' REFUGEE GROUP SAYS  </P> <P> A proposed Santa Clarita city ordinance would make it a misdemeanor for day  laborers to solicit work on city streets or sidewalks -- a measure that  immigration rights groups said would be the harshest move yet in Los Angeles  County against the workers.  </P> <P> The proposed ordinance, to be considered by the City Council on Tuesday, also  would make it illegal to hire a day laborer off the street.  </P> <P> "It is really horrendous," said Ruth Capelle, acting director of the Central  American Refugee Center in Los Angeles. She said she had never heard of such a  strict measure aimed at day laborers.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Jo Anne Darcy said Friday that she doubted the city would take  such a hard line against the laborers. "I don't think we'd ever do it," she  said. The main issue, she said, is safety, not immigration control.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Recommendations Sought  </P> <P> The City Council asked city staff earlier this month to recommend ways to  control the laborers but did not specifically request a measure that would make  it illegal to solicit work from streets and sidewalks.  </P> <P> The laborers, who gather along San Fernando Road in Newhall, sometimes stand in  the street or rush out into traffic to be the first in line for a job, Darcy  said. Construction work along San Fernando Road has made conditions even more  dangerous, and she said she feared that a job-seeker might be killed in  traffic.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputies recently warned the laborers  to stay out of traffic, and the problem seems to be improving, Darcy said.  Traffic safety was the main complaint the council heard about the laborers, but  Darcy said some residents and merchants accused the laborers of loitering and  littering.  </P> <P> Advocates for day laborers called the proposed Santa Clarita ordinance  misguided and unwise.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Don't Have Any Options'  </P> <P> "Turning job-seeking into a crime really doesn't solve much," said Anne  Kamsvaag of the Coalition for Humane Immigrants Rights of Los Angeles.  "Realistically, these people don't have any options. They're not just going to  evaporate."  </P> <P> The coalition and the refugee center last year successfully lobbied the  Glendale City Council to reject an ordinance similar to the Santa Clarita  measure. Instead of banning day laborers, the compromise worked out between  immigration rights groups and the city allowed the Catholic Youth Organization  to establish a site for the workers to gather each morning.  </P> <P> Next month, Los Angeles is expected to open a gathering site for day laborers  in the Harbor area. The site is part of a $90,000 pilot program to establish  eight such sites in Los Angeles, said Bill Molina, a management analyst with  the city Community Development Department. A site in Pacoima could be opened by  October, he said.  </P></p>

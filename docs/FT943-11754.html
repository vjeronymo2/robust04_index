			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Sales fall hits US drugs group Marion Merrell Dow, the US drugs group majority-owned by Dow Chemical, suffered a 23 per cent decline in earnings per share during the second quarter. It blamed falling sales for a number of its biggest products. Lost sales from prescription drugs were replaced by sales of lower-margin products at Rugby Group, a generics drug manufacturer acquired during the last year, which contributed sales of Dollars 83m in the latest period. After-tax profits for the quarter were Dollars 116m, or 43 cents a share, down 23 per cent from a year ago (before a one-off charge taken in the 1993 period.) For the half year, net income was Dollars 204m, 12 per cent lower than the year before. The company's performance stands in marked contrast to other US drugs groups, most of which beat market expectations during the second three months of the year, on solid sales growth in their home market. Their figures suggest the pessimism over the effect of managed care on drug pricing may have been overdone, at least in the short term. Leaving aside the effect of acquisitions, sales at Marion Merrell Dow in the three months were 15 per cent lower than the Dollars 750m of a year ago. Including acquisitions, though, sales rose to Dollars 764m. The fall-off in prescription drug sales included a 24 per cent drop in sales of Seldane, an anti-allergy product, to Dollars 201m; a 10 per cent drop in the Cardizem family of cardiovascular pharmaceuticals, to Dollars 188m; and a 16 per cent decline in revenues from Carafate, an ulcer drug, to Dollars 38m. Seldane's patent expired in April, while Cardizem has been off patent for some time.</p>

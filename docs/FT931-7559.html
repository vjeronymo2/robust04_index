			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / NatWest denies free banking set to end LORD ALEXANDER, chairman of National Westminster Bank, yesterday insisted that his bank had no immediate plan to end 'free' banking for personal customers who remain in credit. Lord Alexander however said he supported the principle that banks should end internal subsidies to forms of business which make a loss. One bank has estimated that up to 80 per cent of its personal accounts operate at a loss. Lord Alexander said at the presentation of the bank's full-year results for 1992: 'In principle, the banking industry has to aim for a situation where it gives good services and receives a fair price with a minimum of cross-subsidies.' His remarks follow a warning from Sir Nicholas Goodison, president of the British Bankers' Association, that efforts to end internal subsidies were likely to put 'free' banking at risk. In spite of speculation that NatWest could be the first bank to introduce such charges, Lord Alexander said: 'We have no current plans to introduce charges for personal customers whose accounts are in credit.'

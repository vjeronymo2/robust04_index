Speaking at a press conference where they discussed this  normally quiet British territory's 7.8 percent increase in crime  from 1992, Ratcliffe said, "There is evidence drugs are shipped  here to go to north. Some do find the local market but it's  impossible that all seized drugs are for the domestic market."    Ratcliffe said the 4,330 pounds of marijuana and 52 pounds  of  cocaine seized by police in 1992 would represent a major  consumption by all of the islands 27, 000 residents if it stayed  in the Cayman Islands.    He said he believed the amounts seized represent only 10  percent of all drugs reaching the Cayman Islands. And he added  these figures were only what police seized, not what customs  officers confiscated in 1993. 1993 customs seizures were not  available.    Cutts said Cayman "is like a giant warehouse" for the  trans-shipment of drugs from Jamaica and Honduras. He said most  of the marijuana and cocaine come in boats under cover of night.    The Cayman Islands has no coast guard or navy and only one  police patrol boat for approxiamately 300 miles of coast line.  Ratcliffe said the 7.8-percent rise in crime was directly  attributable to drug arrests and offences.    "There is evidence there are far more drugs on Grand Cayman  than have ever been here before," he said. Drug-related arrests  jumped from 606 in 1992 to 894 in 1993, a rise of 47.5 percent.  There were 3,298 crime reports in 1993 compared with 3058 in  1993, Ratcliffe said.    The number of burglaries in the territory fell in 1993 from  765 to 680. The solution rate on those crimes was 36 percent, up  12 percent from 1992, said Ratcliffe.    Drugs are an increasing problem in the Cayman Islands. A  local high court judge recently said 80 percent of all inmates  at the local prison were convicted on drug or drug related  offences.    Ratcliffe said he believed more than 80 percent of property  crimes--burglary and theft--were done to obtain property or  money to trade for drugs.    For 1994, Cayman has already had its first ever armed  robbery  of a tourist. Two local men have been arrested in connection  with the incident and are currently awaiting trial.</p>

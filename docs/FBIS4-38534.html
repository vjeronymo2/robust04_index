			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 31 May -- Satisfaction with the Federation  Council's endorsement of the Russian president's decree  extending the state of emergency in the area of conflict in  North Ossetia and Ingushetia was expressed in an interview with  an ITAR-TASS correspondent by the presidents of both republics,  who are members of the chamber. In the opinion of North  Ossetian leader Akhsarbek Galazov, the refugee problem can only  be resolved if people who are to live together understand that  this is necessary. He also thinks that the refugee problem must  be tackled throughout Russia.    Ingush President Ruslan Aushev said the new decree was  "better than previous ones, since it was more down-to-earth."  Specifically, it indicates that the procedure for moving people  into abandoned dwellings must be submitted by 15 June. "But  there is one danger: the decree may not be implemented," he  added.    Concern that the decree may not be implemented was also  voiced by Issa Kustoyev, chairman of the Federation Council's  committee for constitutional legislation: "the disease has been  allowed to develop unchecked and over billion rubles allocated  to settle the problem have been swallowed up, yet there are  still homeless people, and they are still starving." According  to him, not a single question has yet been solved, although  "decree after decree repeats that the provisional administration  as a special form of rule must control the situation." A deputy  who had visited the area of the conflict on more than one  occasion, noted that the deputies' monitoring commission which  it had been decided to set up had to check to see that the  provisions of the presidential decree were being implemented.</p>

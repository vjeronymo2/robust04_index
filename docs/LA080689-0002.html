			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALVAGING THE SOCIALIST DREAM;  </P> <P> SOCIALISM PRESENT &amp; FUTURE BY MICHAEL HARRINGTON (ARCADE PUBLISHING:  $19.95; 320 PP.)  </P> <P> The Cold War is over, and the winner is . . . Sweden. "Socialism: Present &amp;  Future" is the book that tells you why.  </P> <P> As Eastern Europe emerges from the shadows of communism, its peoples are  rushing to embrace the economic system now firmly entrenched in most of the  democratic nations of Europe. The Poles, the Hungarians, the Czechs and their  neighbors want to combine the economic dynamism of American capitalism with the  meager but durable social security that has been the one achievement of  socialism Soviet-style. The middle way between these two extremes? Democratic  socialism as practiced in Western Europe: Sweden, indeed, but other countries  as well, including Germany, France and even Spain.  </P> <P> The trend is not spreading to Eastern Europe alone. In Asia, the Chinese people  are attempting to reach this fusion system from a government well to its left,  and the South Koreans and the Filipinos are trying to reach it from the right.  Japan may be the most striking case of all. In "Japan, Inc.," government  authority over private enterprise has been, by American standards, unsettlingly  socialist and outrageously successful. Now, with the victory of declared  socialists at the Japanese polls, that country is clearly taking a further step  toward the international center.  </P> <P> Polls show that Americans, too, want this mixed economy. We want more and  better health care, better government services for the aged, the infirm and the  homeless. We want cleaner air, longer vacations, better schools and more child  care -- but we don't want to lose our economic or personal freedom to get them.  </P> <P> Michael Harrington was a lifelong student of the tradition of democratic  socialism and, as chairperson of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA),  was a member of the Socialist International on a par with such European figures  as Willy Brandt and Francois Mitterrand. In "Socialism: Present &amp; Future,"  the crowning achievement of a distinguished career, Harrington moves between  the theoretical and the political aspects of this middle way to create a book  of startling insight.  </P> <P> Socialist theory is a complicated subject, one that does not endear itself to  American readers. It mostly concerns people with strange names in far-off  countries arguing about such gripping topics as the epistemological  underpinnings of the Hegelian dialectic and the political implications of  Bismarck's social insurance legislation.  </P> <P> But you don't have to be a rocket scientist to follow Harrington's pellucid  narration. This is a book about socialism for people who think that Gramsci is  a kind of hot antipasto, and that Rosa Luxemburg is the name of a town.  </P> <P> It is also a book that will cause pain to dogmatists of every stripe.  Harrington has no patience for the cult-like orthodoxy found among so many  schools of political economy. Like John Kenneth Galbraith, whose ironic,  elegant prose finds echoes here, Harrington delights in pricking the  self-esteem of the smugly dogmatic. The free-market theorist who despises all  forms of state interference and the dogmatic socialist who wants to nationalize  everything in sight will find little to like in this book.  </P> <P> Harrington does not bother with cheap shots in his book; he takes on big  questions and big thinkers. His attack on Lenin's version of Marxism is tough  and penetrating, and Marx himself comes in for extensive reappraisal. While  hailing Marx's humane and democratic ideals, Harrington argues that Marx was  mistaken to believe that he had discovered a "scientific socialism."  </P> <P> Marx believed -- passionately -- that he had purged socialism of the naive and  unrealistic elements found in the work of men like Fourier, Robert Owens and  Saint-Simone. These thinkers had all envisioned future utopias in which the  lion would lie down with the lamb, physical and mental labor would be shared by  all members of the community, crabgrass would no longer grow, and the rivers of  the world would run with lemonade.  </P> <P> Marx tried to get rid of what he saw as sentimental claptrap and to base  socialist politics on objective laws of historical development. The result may  have been a more realistic political program, but Harrington believes Marx was  wrong to try to divorce socialism from the utopian dream, much less to think he  had succeeded in doing so.  </P> <P> He was wrong to try, because the idealistic dreams of the utopian socialists  represent values not to be forgotten; the barbarity of Stalinism shows what can  happen when socialists murder their dreams. Marx was wrong to think he had  succeeded because, for all his hard-nosed scientism, he was a dreamer whose  faith in a better future motivated him and his disciples.  </P> <P> John Lennon, then, more closely epitomizes Harrington's vision of the ideal  socialist dreamer than Vladimir Lenin; "Imagine" is a better anthem for the  movement Harrington has in mind than "The Internationale," the traditional  socialist anthem.  </P> <P> Though the socialist dream is alive and well in Sweden, problems remain,  Harrington says. For two generations, Swedish socialists and their counterparts  in Germany, France and elsewhere in Europe have been quietly assembling and  fitting together the pieces of a way of life more humane but no less free than  anything our long-suffering species has seen to date.  </P> <P> Yet all is not well in the world of democratic socialism.  </P> <P> The ossified bureaucracies of the welfare state and the unproductive behemoths  into which many nationalized industries have turned have led to recent attacks  on the democratic socialist movement. From the right come the Thatcherites,  claiming that nationalizations are inherently inefficient, and that welfare  corrupts donor and recipient. From the nontraditional left come movements like  feminism and "Green" environmentalism with acerbic and often trenchant  criticisms of the socialist tradition.  </P> <P> As Harrington considers the future of democratic socialism, he acknowledges the  substantial accuracy of these critiques. The socialism of the 21st Century, he  believes, will be more open to markets, sensitive to feminist and other  minority concerns, and allied with the ecology movement.  </P> <P> Americans will feel that this "Socialism of the 21st Century" sounds like the  Rainbow Coalition -- and they will have a point. But for Harrington, the  Rainbow Coalition is more a rough draft than a blueprint. Harrington belongs to  a rare breed -- the American political intellectual. Mass movements and  charismatic leaders -- even when they come from his own side of the political  spectrum -- do not so much make him nervous as they bring out the teacher in  him. Movements of protest and for social change need a grounding in history and  political theory.  </P> <P> This is where Harrington believes that the broad and quarrelsome stream of  socialist intellectual tradition has its place. American social reformers  should know more than they often do about the history of political experiments  in other countries. They sorely lack the seasoning and hands-on experience that  participation in government has given to generations of European socialists and  may soon give the Japanese.  </P> <P> In "Socialism: Present &amp; Future," Harrington has produced a book that gives  American readers the best available guide to this rich and complex tradition.  Every American concerned about the direction of our country should read this  book -- and so, too, should everyone interested in the political trends that  shape the politics of our most important allies.  </P> <P> More than anything, this is a book about hope. Hope for a better tomorrow, hope  for the peaceful resolution of international conflict, hope that the human  spirit can rise above petty fears and squabbles to fulfill its age-old dreams.  </P> <P> It is also a personal statement. Harrington began this book on the day he  received a diagnosis of cancer; last week, word came of his death. It is  typical of Harrington that, faced with a crisis of this magnitude, he would  produce an optimistic book of social theory; typical, too, that the effort  under such circumstances would bring such magnificent results.  </P></p>

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / FIS would review 'illegal' Algerian deals Algeria's Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), outlawed after the cancellation of elections it was poised to win in January 1992, considers all international agreements signed since then by the country's leaders to be illegal. If the FIS did come to power all such agreements, with governments and foreign companies, would, at the very least, be reviewed. The FIS position was spelled out by Mr Rabah Khebir, the spokesman of the FIS leadership in exile in Europe, during an interview with the Financial Times. Mr Khebir, a 38-year-old professor of physics, polled 45 per cent of the vote in the eastern Algerian port of Collo in the first round of the elections in December 1991. He was subsequently jailed, and later put under house arrest from which he escaped two years ago. 'The Algerian people will not endorse agreements signed by an illegal government. That is a position of principle', he said. Contracts up for review might be suspended, if it was found that 'corruption has been practised, or if the interests of the Algerian people had not been well served'. Mr Khebir insisted, however, that it was in Algeria's interest to 'open its doors economically' and that the FIS wanted 'to have good relations with the west'. But, he added, leading western countries bore 'a heavy responsibility with regard to the future course of events in Algeria'. He noted with regret that the recent Group of Seven summit in Naples had called on the military-backed regime to open a 'dialogue with all components of Algerian society who reject violence and terrorism', and noted that the violence began only after the regime halted the electoral process. At the insistence of France, last month's G7 communique omitted any mention of the FIS as a partner for political dialogue. A number of western companies and international banks are known to be have recently renewed contact with the FIS, something which happened regularly when it was still legal in Algeria. Mr Khebir said at least one big French company could be included in the list. Among the more important international agreements which would be affected by a review are: All those contracts covering imports worth an estimated Dollars 23bn (Pounds 15bn) from January 1992 to December 1994. A Dollars 1bn standby credit from the IMF, agreed in April this year. A Paris Club agreement to reschedule this year Dollars 3.4bn of the Dollars 14.5bn Algeria owes to foreign governments. Commercial banks are expected to reschedule this autumn at least Dollars 600m of debt to them due this year. An estimated 20 exploration contracts signed with international oil companies. Foreign investment in new drilling is expected to grow from Dollars 199m to Dollars 234m this year, while a Dollars 1.3bn production sharing deal in an existing oil field, Rhourde El Baguel, was also signed last month between Atlantic Richfield and Sonatrach, the Algerian oil and gas state monopoly. However the new law, which liberalised the rules governing joint ventures between Sonatrach and its foreign partners, was passed by the national assembly in December 1991. Some of the components of the Dollars 1bn-plus project to build a gas pipeline from Algeria to Spain. Half of the value of this work, involving the laying of the pipeline under the aegis of the US contractor Bechtel, is due to start before the end of the summer. Mr Khebir acknowledged that the US, Italy and Spain, had called on Algerian leaders to begin a dialogue with FIS, but said the French position had made matters more difficult. 'I am not anti-French,' he stressed. When asked if a third party could help promote a dialogue, Mr Khebir said he saw no reason why countries such as the US, Italy and Spain could not do so. France however 'could not usefully play that role. Its current attitude has ruled it out.' There are three conditions made by the FIS for resuming dialogue with Gen Lamine Zeroual, the head of state. First, the release of Mr Abassi Madani and Mr Ali Benhadj, the two paramount FIS leaders, who have been held in Blida military prison since June 1991, plus guarantees of safety for all members of the FIS supreme council, 70 of whose 80 members are in Algeria. There should also be guarantees that the council could meet freely in Algeria. Any discussions with the military leaders would also include other parties in Algeria, and would lead to a resumption of the electoral process, at which foreign observers would be welcome. Mr Khebir said Gen Zeroual's professed wish for a dialogue was at odds with the violent repression practised by the army and state security forces in recent months. He estimated the number of Algerian lives lost since January 1992 at 15,000, with a further 27,000 people held in prisons or in camps. Other opposition leaders, such as Mr Hocine Ait Ahmed, the respected leader of the Socialist Forces Front. recently put the figure of those killed at over 10,000. The FIS spokesman warned that without a serious political dialogue, violence was bound to escalate. 'The regime would be well advised to talk to us,' he said. Mr Khebir noted the Islamic Armed Group (GIA) had over the past year claimed responsibility for the murder of most of the 59 foreigners who have been killed and had rejected elections. 'We have always denounced the killing of foreigners,' said Mr Khebir, adding that the escalation of violence made the question of who was in control of the armed groups ever more difficult. The first unequivocal condemnation by the FIS of the killing of foreigners came in fact a month ago, and is believed by observers to be the result of the growing showdown between the GIA and the Islamic Liberation Army, which owes allegiance to the FIS. Over the past few months a number of senior FIS members switched to the GIA.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- The top policymaker of  Japan's main opposition party on Wednesday [16 February] blasted  as insufficient North Korea's acceptance of inspections of its  seven nuclear facilities and urged it to allow checks on the two  most controversial sites.    "I'm disgruntled at the fact that the latest agreement  between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) has not cleared up all the ambiguities," said Ryutaro  Hashimoto, chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's Policy  Affairs Research council.    Addressing a news conference at the Japan National Press  Club, Hashimoto said, "there are still some murky points, as  North Korea has not agreed to accept inspection of its two  nuclear waste reprocessing facilities."    The IAEA has said the two facilities, located in a nuclear  complex in Yongbyon north of Pyongyang, might yield evidence of  how much plutonium North Korea has produced in the past.    The IAEA and the United States have said they are keen to  check the discrepancies between the actual amount of plutonium  North Korea has produced and a much smaller amount of plutonium  the nation has admitted manufacturing in the past.    They have expressed concern that missing plutonium from the  Yongbyon nuclear reactors might have been diverted to produce  nuclear bombs.    Hashimoto's comment came a day after North Korea told the  IAEA it will allow IAEA monitors to inspect the seven nuclear  sites, while keeping out them out of the two critical facilities.    Hashimoto, a former Finance Minister, said the LDP will take  up the issue of these ambiguities during question-and-answer  sessions at the House of Representatives Budget Committee in a  regular Diet session that reconvened Wednesday.    He urged the coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa to take a firmer stand in responding to a proposal --  now before the UN Security Council -- to slap trade sanctions on  North Korea if it fails to allow full inspection of all the  facilities the IAEA is demanding to see.    "The LDP's own study indicates that the Hosokawa  administration has not compiled any crisis management program"  to deal with the North Korean nuclear issue, he said.    Hashimoto said the LDP "will not consider exchanges" between  party officials and the North Korean Government following the  1993 fall from grace of former LDP Vice President Shin Kanemaru  who had kept ties with the Pyongyang authorities.    "Although it is true that Mr. Kanemaru held talks with the  North Korean Government, he did so as a mere individual," he  said. He said the LDP had never sought to build ties with the  North Korean leadership as a party policy.    He was speaking about a suprapartisan delegation to  Pyongyang  in September 1990 led by Kanemaru and then Social Democratic  Party chairman Makoto Tanabe. Their talks with North Korean  leader Kim Il-song later led to the start of diplomatic  normalization talks between the two countries.    The normalization talks broke down after Pyongyang refused  to  comply with the IAEA's demands to inspect its nuclear facilities.</p>

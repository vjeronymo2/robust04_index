[Kocherov] Viktor Nikolayevich, if everything really is  moving toward the creation of the CIS JAF [Joint Armed Forces],  how are to we understand the transformation of the CIS JAF High  Command into the Staff for Coordinating Military Cooperation?  Can this be considered a step forward in the development of  military cooperation?    [Samsonov] Paradoxical though this may seem, at the present  moment this really is so, although just two years ago the path  toward military cooperation seemed quite different to all of us.  The creation of the CIS JAF High Command in March 1992 was a  consequence of reckoning on preserving a unified defense area  and joint leadership of the General-Purpose Forces and of the  systems of air defense, missile attack early warning, ABM  defense, verification of strategic forces and weapons of mass  destruction, etc. But life, as is known, has ordered things in  its own way.    Military organizational development in the Commonwealth  states took the path of creating national armies. By July 1992  it was already clear that it would not be possible to create the  General Purpose Forces. The post of commander of these forces  was abolished. The process of disuniting the air defense,  missile attack early warning, and ABM defense systems began in  the first half of 1993. Elements of these systems were  scattered about the territories of different, now sovereign CIS  states and had, in point of fact, been "privatized" by them --  which led virtually to their destruction.    Then Russia's military-political leadership assumed the  functions of managing the Strategic Forces. The High Command's  sphere of managerial activity was shrinking like shagreen  leather. Therefore in August 1993 the CIS Defense Ministers  Council adopted the decision to reorganize the High Command into  the Staff for Coordinating Military Cooperation, which was  implemented at the meeting of heads of state in Ashgabat 24  December last year.    Of course, we would all like very much to preserve the  common  defense area and its administration, unified defense systems and  infrastructure, joint armed forces, and the common "nuclear  umbrella" over the CIS, but.... None of this exists yet (or  already). Not that anybody objects to coordination in the  military sphere. Therefore, if we evaluate from these positions  the transformation of the CIS JAF High Command into the Staff  for Coordinating Military Cooperation, this is a natural  phenomenon. But it can hardly be considered a positive fact that  we failed to preserve the common defense area and to create  joint armed forces. Nevertheless, I am firmly confident that the  creation of such armed forces is a matter for the not so distant  future.    [Kocherov] You have not spoken of another aspect of this  problem -- the legislative basis on which the policy of military  cooperation was founded. Or are the documents so universal that  they easily fit in with the newly created structure of the Staff  for Coordinating Military Cooperation?    [Samsonov] If only this were so. The High Command has  spent two years working out approximately 100 documents on  questions of defense. The role of the CIS JAF High Command  found its place in such basic documents as the Commonwealth  Charter and the Collective Security Treaty. Now this entire  legislative base has to be revised -- which will take, according  to the most modest estimates, at least two years, because no  more than two military questions are being submitted to the  Heads of State Council. Meanwhile new agreements are waiting in  line, whose signing also brooks no delay.    [Kocherov] In the press today there are many contradictory  reports about the Collective Peacemaking Force [CPF], which most  frequently appears in the guise only of Russia's 201st Motorized  Rifle Division. What is the composition of the CPF?    [Samsonov] The agreement on the CPF and the decision on  forming the CPF, signed by the heads of five CIS states --  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan --  prescribed that the CPF be formed by 1 October 1993 and that its  arrival at its points of stationing on Tajik territory be  ensured. Russia allocated the 201st Motorized Rifle Division and  certain other units to make up the CPF. Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,  and Uzbekistan pledged to send subunits there, up to the  strength of one motorized rifle battalion each. Since the 201st  Motorized Rifle Division has long been in Tajikistan, the  question of manning it and of its timely arrival on station did  not arise.    Things were more complex with the allocation of subunits of  the remaining countries for the CPF. This was all time lost.  This is what it cost: four attacks on border posts and  instances of hostage taking. This constituted moral, material,  and political damage to both Russia and the CIS states, not to  mention the threat to stability in the republics neighboring on  Tajikistan.    In addition to the Russian troops, the CPF is now made up of  a reinforced motorized rifle battalion of the Uzbek Armed  Forces, an incomplete battalion of the Kyrgyz Armed Forces, and  units of the Tajik Armed Forces.    [Kocherov] Nevertheless, how do you rate the position of our  troops in Tajikistan? Are you sure that they will not find  themselves drawn into another war on foreign territory?    [Samsonov] I would rate as stable the position of the CIS  troops in Tajikistan as a whole and of the Russian troops in  particular. They are successfully fulfilling the tasks  entrusted to them, creating favorable conditions for the  political settlement of crisis processes, and ensuring the  covering of the Tajik-Afghan border.    With regard to forecasts, I would say that the CPF in itself  cannot resolve all Tajik problems. It is merely creating  conditions for reconciling the sides, reaching political accord  between the Tajik Government and the opposition, and resolving  the border question with Afghanistan.    Some people believe that Tajikistan can manage without the  Commonwealth's military forces. I do not think so. The troops'  withdrawal from there will not only not ease tension but will  also lead to a new flareup of violence and the exacerbation of  border problems. Therefore, however hard and costly it might be  to maintain the CIS CPF, it is essential to the Commonwealth  and, in particular, to Tajikistan.    Incidentally, a session of the republic Supreme Council was  held in Tajikistan recently, during which a number of awkward  problems were resolved and representatives of irreconcilable  groupings were made to agree to compromises. Hope emerged of  creating a coalition government. The very presence of the CPF  played a stabilizing role here.    [Kocherov] What is the nature of the relationship between  the Staff for Coordinating Military Cooperation and the  Ministries of Defense of those states which are not in the  collective security system?    [Samsonov] We cannot yet speak of any system of relations,  since the staff was only created one month ago. But it is  possible to speak of trends. The chief one is the interest  which Moldova, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine are showing in military  cooperation in very diverse spheres: from the  military-technical sphere to the training of military cadres.    I would particularly like to point to the substantial change  in the views of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry leadership on  participation in the collective resolution of defense questions.  Addressing the Ashgabat session of the Commonwealth Defense  Ministers Council, Army General Vitaliy Hryhorovych Radetskyy,  Ukrainian minister of defense, particularly emphasized that, in  addition to developing bilateral interstate relations in the  military sphere, the republic's leadership is examining the  question of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's joining the CIS  Defense Ministers Council.    This, in my estimation, is a substantial step forward in  strengthening the Commonwealth's collective security, which  confirms the general integrational sentiments in the former  republics of the USSR.    A year ago people in Azerbaijan, for example, did not wish  even to speak of any cooperation in the defense sphere. But  today we are awaiting a representative of that republic's armed  forces in the staff. Incidentally, this republic was the ninth  to sign the Collective Security Treaty. I believe it will not  be the last.    [Kocherov] Based on this, what is your forecast for the  future of military cooperation in the CIS?    [Samsonov] To be brief, things will, in my opinion, evolve  as follows -- from the coordination of military cooperation to a  military-political alliance and the creation of joint armed  forces. I will refrain at present from speaking about the  schedule for carrying out this trend. I am convinced of one  thing -- along with economic integration and the strengthening  of political cooperation, questions of restoring the common  defense area and creating joint armed forces will also be  resolved. The CPF is the first step on this path.</p>

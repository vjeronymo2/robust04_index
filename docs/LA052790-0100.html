			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GOTCH'S EXPERIENCE GIVES HIM THE EDGE OVER MARSTON  </P> <P> Two intelligent, articulate candidates are competing in the June 5 special  election to fill the vacancy in the 78th Assembly District -- and the  similarities between Mike Gotch and Jeff Marston don't end there. Though Gotch  is a liberal Democrat and Marston a moderate Republican, voters will have a  difficult time telling the candidates apart.  </P> <P> Both support abortion rights and capital punishment and strongly oppose  offshore oil drilling. Both deem an increase in the county's dismal share of  state revenue their top priority. Both are against development of the proposed  De Anza resort on the shores of Mission Bay.  </P> <P> The difference between Gotch and Marston, in an election whose victor will be  casting votes in the Assembly perhaps a month after the election, is that Gotch  has a proven record of legislative achievement in eight years as a San Diego  city councilman. Marston's only government experience is as an aide to former  U.S. Sen. S.I. Hayakawa and San Diego Councilwoman Gloria McColl.  </P> <P> Voters should elect Gotch to the Assembly from the 78th District, which  stretches from Ocean Beach and Pacific Beach on the coast, inland to Miramar  Naval Air Station, south to downtown San Diego and east to East San Diego.  </P> <P> Gotch brings to the race an environmental record that Marston cannot match.  Gotch championed the successful campaign for the 1985 ballot initiative that  restricted development in the city's urban reserve. He has served on the state  Coastal Commission. He opposed the SANDER trash-to-energy facility. He is a  longtime ally of the city's environmentalists. The redevelopment of Mission  Beach Park was not the blunder that Gotch's opponents would make it out to be.  </P> <P> Marston, in contrast, has no record of his own and worked most recently for  McColl, a generally pro-development councilwoman with an unenviable  environmental record. Though his work as a staffer is by all accounts  commendable, and his enthusiasm undeniable, he does not show Gotch's grasp of  the specifics on some issues.  </P> <P> Gotch would take eight years of experience on the council to Sacramento, where  he would join the Democratic majority that controls both houses. (Under the  rules for the June 5 contest, voters will mark two ballots -- one for the  special election, and a second in the primary for the November election.)  </P> <P> We are troubled, however, by the campaign mailer Gotch sent to 40,000 homes the  weekend before the April 10 primary, misidentifying the party affiliation of  chief Democratic rival Howard Wayne. Gotch's aides called the mistake a  typographical one. We wonder.  </P> <P> On balance, however, Mike Gotch deserves to be elected in the 78th Assembly  District.  </P></p>

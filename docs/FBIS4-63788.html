			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku 24 May (AZERTAC)--The parliament crisis  continues in Azerbaijan. This crisis began last week when 15  MP's (almost a third of the parliament) had left the parliament  hall signifying their protest against the signing of the Bishkek  Protocol. This action of the MPs has deprived the parliament of  quorum without which the parliament can not fulfil its work.    Yesterday, the parliament appealed to the President Aliyev  and requested him to reduce the quorum from 34 to 26 voices. A  proper draft law was presented to the president. "It is the  most acceptable measure to find a way from the crisis,' the  parliaments speaker said.    There were other proposals of the MP's, e.g. to appeal to  the  "rebellios" MPs and make a request for cooperation. According  to the premier Surat Guseynov, it is necessary to do "for the  sake of national accord." There also was a radical proposal to  dismiss the parliament and delegate its powers to the president.</p>

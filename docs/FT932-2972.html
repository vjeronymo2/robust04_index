			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Consortium bids for Polish cement group MANAGEMENT and workers, backed by a consortium of Polish banks and foreign investors, have offered to purchase the Gorazdze works, the country's largest and most modern cement producer. The bid, which is being considered by Poland's privatisation ministry, is in competition with a three-year effort by CBR, the Belgian cement company, to purchase the plant. The CBR offer, which includes the purchase of the Strzelce Opolskie cement works nearby, has been resisted by the trade unions at Gorazdze which want to see control of their plant stay in Polish hands. The consortium's offer is the first time that shop floor resistance to a foreign takeover has been transformed into a rival bid backed by Polish banks and foreign investors willing to take a minority stake. The rival offer would see 35 per cent of the plant's equity go to management and employees while a further 16 per cent would be taken up by the Polish Development Bank and 10 per cent would go to the Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy. Another 10 per cent would be purchased by Warta, a privatised insurance company, and 9 per cent by a British investment group. The US Congress financed Polish American Enterprise Fund is interested in purchasing a 10 per cent share in Gorazdze while the remaining 10 per cent would be sold through a public offer.</p>

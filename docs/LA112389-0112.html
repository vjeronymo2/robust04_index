			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDY CLEARS FILTERED COFFEE IN BREWING DEBATE;  </P> <P> HEALTH: AMERICA'S CUP OF CHOICE DOES NOT RAISE LEVELS OF CHOLESTEROL IN THE  BLOOD, DUTCH SCIENTISTS SAY.  </P> <P> If the decision to down a second cup of coffee is beginning to seem as  treacherous to your health as scarfing a slab of well-marbled beef, take heart:  Now comes word that filtered coffee, America's brew of choice, has no effect on  levels of cholesterol in the blood.  </P> <P> That is the conclusion of a team of Dutch researchers who compared the effects  of filtered coffee and a European method of boiling coffee in a thermos. After  nine weeks, filtered-coffee drinkers' cholesterol levels were unchanged. The  boiled-coffee drinkers' levels had crept up 10%.  </P> <P> Precisely why that might be so remains a mystery, the researchers report today  in the New England Journal of Medicine. But their finding is considered good  news in the United States, a country where filtering, also known as "the drip  method," is all the rage.  </P> <P> These happy tidings for coffee lovers comes amid a welter of conflicting  reports on the health hazards of everyone's favorite vice: Caffeine is bad; no,  decaffeination is bad; no, it's the fats in coffee beans that are to blame; no,  coffee isn't bad after all.  </P> <P> Just last week, researchers at Stanford University reported that decaf, not  caf, raised so-called "bad cholesterol" levels in middle-aged men. The week  before, another Dutch study presented in Houston implicated certain fatty  compounds produced in boiling coffee.  </P> <P> "At the moment, there's a lot of evidence to suggest that coffee and  cholesterol are linked in some fashion. But how they are linked is unclear,"  said Dr. Basil Rifkind, chief of lipid metabolism and atherogenesis at the  National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.  </P> <P> "If you ask me should people change their coffee-drinking habits, I don't think  so, not yet," Rifkind said. "The usual Solomonic wisdom is that people  shouldn't drink too much coffee in any case. . . . But I wouldn't go any  further than that."  </P> <P> About 52.5% of all Americans over age 10 drink coffee, according to the  National Coffee Assn. Average consumption is 3 1/3 cups a day and the method of  choice is filtering, said the association's George E. Boecklin, a  five-cup-a-day man (filtered or freeze-dried).  </P> <P> In Europe and Scandinavia, by contrast, many coffee drinkers boil their jo,  pouring scalding water over roughly ground beans in a thermos. Such differences  have left researchers wondering whether the brewing method might influence the  effects of coffee on health.  </P> <P> Early suggestions that coffee might be bad for the heart arose from long-term  studies of heart disease among the general population. While people who  experienced heart attacks seemed to drink more coffee than others, it was  unclear whether the coffee was to blame.  </P> <P> Perhaps the problem was some other bad habit of coffee drinkers -- say, smoking  cigarettes or eating too much Danish pastry. But even when those factors were  taken into account, researchers still detected links between heart disease and  coffee.  </P> <P> They then went on to examine the cholesterol levels of people who said they had  drunk a lot of coffee and people who said they had not. The results were  conflicting. But several Scandinavian studies suggested a strong link between  high cholesterol and coffee.  </P> <P> To examine that finding more closely, Drs. Annette A. A. Bak and Diederick E.  Grobbee of Erasmus University in Rotterdam studied 107 healthy young men and  women. They were divided into three groups -- drinkers of filtered coffee,  boiled coffee, no coffee.  </P> <P> After nine weeks in which the coffee groups drank four to six cups a day, the  researchers found no change in the cholesterol levels of the no-coffee and  filtered-coffee groups. But they did find a 10% rise in the cholesterol levels  of the boiled-coffee group.  </P> <P> Specifically, what increased was low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the  so-called bad form of the fat-like substance, which can build up in the  arteries. Narrowed arteries can lead to blockages which, in turn, can interrupt  blood flow and cause a heart attack.  </P> <P> "In conclusion . . . our findings suggest that the consumption of filtered  coffee does not affect serum lipid levels," the researchers wrote. "The  consumption of boiled coffee, however, has a considerable effect in raising  cholesterol levels."  </P> <P> Coffee industry officials called the report a vindication of America's coffee  habit.  </P> <P> "We never advocate boiling coffee to begin with," sniffed Lawrence D. Hayes,  president of the Specialty Coffee Assn. of America. "The specialty industry  advises people to take their percolators and throw them out. Because that's the  best way to boil coffee."  </P> <P> The researchers speculated that the effect of boiled coffee on cholesterol  might be traceable to "active substances" released during preparation. By  leaving coffee grounds exposed to hot water for a longer time, boiling might  pose a greater health risk.  </P> <P> Another theory concerns the filter paper itself: If some active substance is to  blame, perhaps it is absorbed by the paper or left behind by "selective  filtering" because of the size of the particles, the researchers suggested.  </P> <P> Because the precise way in which coffee influences cholesterol remains unclear,  the researchers warned that their findings "may be relevant for the products of  similar methods, such as percolated coffee, camp coffee and Turkish coffee."  </P> <P> Other researchers said Wednesday that they were not surprised by the new  findings but advised caution in their interpretation.  </P> <P> Andrea LaCroix, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington who published  a paper in 1986 linking heavy coffee consumption to coronary heart disease,  emphasized that much remains to be learned about the risks that coffee poses  for the human heart.  </P> <P> In light of that ambiguity, and the conflicting reports surfacing in recent  weeks, LaCroix urged that people not overestimate the influence of coffee on  the heart.  </P> <P> "If people are concerned about their risk of heart disease, there are  well-known areas for making life style changes," LaCroix said. "Those include  stopping smoking, making sure your blood pressure is within normal limits and  likewise serum cholesterol.  </P> <P> "And if you still have energy after that, I would say the data are much more  persuasive that increasing physical activity levels would be helpful, (rather)  than changing your coffee consumption habits," LaCroix said.  </P></p>

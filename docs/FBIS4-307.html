			<p>BFN     [Text] Nigeria and Benin Republic held talks today in Abuja  touching on matters of interest to both countries and the West  African subregion. The Beninois team was led by that country's  president, Nicephore Soglo, while the head of state, General  Sani Abacha, led the Nigerian team.    In the opening session of the talks, Gen. Abacha described  President Soglo as a distinguished African who has worked to  strengthen relations between Nigeria and Benin Republic. He  said President Soglo, as ECOWAS [Economic Community of West  African States] chairman, has displayed a high sense of  responsibility in handling issues of unity and security in the  West African subregion.    President Soglo said Africans should always strive to settle  their differences themselves. The Beninois leader, whose visit  has to do with the economy of the subregion, the Liberian  affair, and the Nigeria-Cameroon misunderstanding, advised  Africans to unite in order to overcome the economic problems  currently facing the continent. President Soglo and his team  have since returned home.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 15, 1990, the Act was amended. The amendments added a new section 129 to the Act, which applies to a range of solid waste incinerators including MWC's, medical waste incinerators (MWI's),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infectious waste incinerators, and industrial waste incinerators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under authority of sections 111 and 129 of the Act of 1990, the EPA was directed to develop and promulgate MACT-based NSPS for MWC's according to a specified schedule. At the time of enactment of the Act as amended in 1990, the EPA had already proposed, under section 111 of the Act, NSPS based on BDT for all sizes of new MWC's. Section 129 of the Act of 1990 directed the EPA to promulgate standards based on BDT under the deadlines imposed in the consent decree in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> State of New York et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> versus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reilly <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (No. 89&hyph;1729 D.D.C.), but limited applicability of the standards to combustors with unit capacities greater than 225 Mg/day. As a result, the standards, which were proposed in 1989, under development for promulgation in late 1990 were revised to be applicable only to these MWC units. The final standards were signed by the Administrator on January 11, 1991 published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on February 11, 1991 (56 FR 5488).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 129 of the Act also directs the EPA to develop another NSPS for MWC's that would be based on a more stringent control scenario, apply to smaller facilities, and cover more pollutants. Specifically, section 129 directs the EPA to promulgate MACT-based NSPS for MWC units at MWC plants with capacities to combust less than 225 Mg/day. Section 129 also directs the EPA to develop numerical emission limits for Cd, Pb, and Hg, to incorporate siting requirements for new units, and to develop operator training requirements. Additionally, section 129 directs the EPA to develop an opacity limit for air curtain incinerators firing certain ``clean'' fuels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's proposal complies with all requirements of section 129 described above. This has been done by: (1) Proposing MACT-based NSPS that cover MWC units at plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day; (2) proposing numerical emission limits for Cd, Pb, and Hg; (3) proposing siting requirements for new MWC units; (4) proposing operator training requirements; and (5) proposing opacity limits for air curtain incinerators firing specific ``clean'' fuels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed NSPS are, in effect, replacing the February 11, 1991 subpart Ea NSPS for MWC facilities for which construction, modification, or reconstruction begins after September 20, 1994, because the February 11, 1991 subpart Ea NSPS are based on BDT rather than MACT. The February 11, 1991 subpart Ea NSPS will remain in effect for facilities for which construction, modification or reconstruction began after December 20, 1989 but on or before September 20, 1994. Those existing facilities constructed after December 20, 1989 but before this proposal would be subject to both the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS and the subpart Cb guidelines proposed in a separate notice in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This dual coverage under both the proposed subpart Cb and the 1991 subpart Ea is further discussed in the preamble to the proposed subpart Cb in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Selection of Source Category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The previous MWC NSPS adopted on February 11, 1991 provided the rationale for the selection of MWC's as a source category to be regulated (56 FR 5488). Moreover, section 129 of the Act directs the EPA to issue NSPS for this source category, and thereby confirms the EPA's earlier decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's proposed NSPS (subpart Eb) would apply to new MWC's, defined as those MWC's for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced after September 20, 1994. Municipal waste combustors for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced on or before September 20, 1994, would be covered by the subpart Cb emission guidelines proposed in a separate notice in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, as required by section 129 of the Act, today's proposed NSPS would establish opacity limits for certain new air curtain incinerators, for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced after September 20, 1994. Under the proposed NSPS, air curtain incinerators that burn only yard wastes, tree trimmings, and clean untreated lumber would be required to meet an opacity limit and no other requirements would apply. The proposed standards for these air curtain incinerators are presented in section VII of this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Modification or Reconstruction of Existing MWC's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The subpart Ea NSPS proposal published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 20, 1989 (54 FR 52251) provided a discussion of the terms and conditions associated with construction, modification, and reconstruction for MWC's. One change is being proposed. Previously, the terms ``modification'' and ``reconstruction'' were defined under sections 60.14 and 60.15 of subpart A of part 60. Section 129 of the Act has specified a new definition of ``modified solid waste incineration unit'' that combines and revises the previous definitions of ``modification'' and ``reconstruction.'' Specifically, ``modified solid waste incineration unit'' refers to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Modifications for which the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> * * * cumulative costs of the modifications, over the life of the unit, exceed 50 per centum of the original cost of the construction and installation of the unit (not including the cost of any land purchased in connection with such construction or installation) updated to current costs *&blank;*&blank;*. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> or (2) modifications involving <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;*&blank;* a physical change in or change in the method of operation of the unit which increases the amount of any air pollutant emitted by the unit for which standards have been established under [section 129] or section 111 *&blank;*&blank;*. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

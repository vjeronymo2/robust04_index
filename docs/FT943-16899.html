			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: S Australia launches claim against KPMG The South Australian government has launched a claim seeking almost ADollars 3.1bn (USDollars 2.3bn) from accountants KPMG Peat Marwick. The claim relates to the financial troubles of the State Bank of South Australia in 1991. KPMG Peat Marwick acted as auditor of the bank in 1991, before the South Australian government was forced to mount a rescue operation ultimately costing more than ADollars 3.15bn. The claim, one of the largest of its type in Australia, was lodged yesterday in the Supreme Court of South Australia. It follows a ADollars 1.1bn claim against KPMG Peat Marwick earlier this year from the Victorian government over the collapse of the Tricontinental finance group in 1990. That action was settled for ADollars 136m.</p>

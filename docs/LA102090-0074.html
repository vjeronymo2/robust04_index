			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DRAMATIC INTERCEPTION PRESERVES ESPERANZA VICTORY  </P> <P> Esperanza High School placed its faith in defense, which proved to be a wise  decision. But it was a close call.  </P> <P> The Aztecs survived a frantic final drive to defeat Loara, 12-7, Friday in an  Empire League game at Glover Stadium. The Saxons got as close as the Esperanza  25-yard line, but came up short on time, yards and their final pass.  </P> <P> After driving from its own one-yard line in the final three minutes, Loara  quarterback Charles Gipson's last pass ended up in the arms of defensive back  Derek Reeves with nine seconds left. The clock ran out, the Aztecs celebrated  and Esperanza Coach Gary Meek let out a deep sigh.  </P> <P> "All I kept saying to myself was, 'Run the clock, run the clock,' " Meek said.  "It was a long three minutes."  </P> <P> Just before the final drive, the Aztecs appeared on the verge of clinching the  game. Esperanza had a first and goal at the three, but gained only two yards in  three plays. On fourth and goal from inside the one, fullback Mark Parlin was  stopped for no gain and Loara took possession.  </P> <P> From there, Gipson took the Saxons (3-4, 1-1) to the verge of victory. He  completed three passes on the drive, including a screen to Shawn Easter, who  bobbed and weaved for 27 yards and a first down on the 25.  </P> <P> After an incompletion, Gipson lofted a pass to Dan Bokelman, who was  double-covered. The ball was short and Derek Reaves came back to make his sixth  interception of the season and was promptly mobbed by teammates.  </P> <P> The victory puts the Aztecs (7-0, 2-0) in good position to win their first  league title since 1986. They have already beaten Los Alamitos and Loara, their  toughest challengers, and have only Cypress, El Dorado and Katella left.  </P> <P> None of those three teams has a winning record.  </P> <P> "I tell you, Loara is a tough, tough, team," Meek said. "They did a good job of  keeping us out of the end zone most of the game."  </P> <P> The Aztecs got inside the Loara 10 twice in the first half, but came away with  the minimum -- two field goals by Clay King.  </P> <P> By halftime, the Loara defense was in complete control. Esperanza had 69 total  yards and only 10 yards passing.  </P> <P> Esperanza quarterback Keith McDonald completed only one of nine passes and was  intercepted twice.  </P> <P> The Saxons' lone score came after a 56-yard completion to John Karner, which  gave Loara a first down on the Aztec 24.  </P> <P> Three plays later, Gipson threw a swing pass to Easter, who dodged one defender  for an eight-yard touchdown pass. Loara led, 7-6, at halftime.  </P> <P> Esperanza scored on its first possession of the second half, driving 80 yards  in 14 plays. McDonald threw a three-yard pass to Reid Pullen for the touchdown.  </P></p>

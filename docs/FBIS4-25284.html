			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 8 (XINHUA) -- A senior U.S.  Administration official said Wednesday [8 June] that president  Clinton's decision to unconditionally renew China's  most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status will result in a  long-term, mature and evolving relationship with what is  becoming one of the world's most powerful economic forces.    Speaking at the annual meeting of the U.S.-China Business  Council, Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to the president for  economic policy, said, "we will oppose any attempts in Congress  to reverse this decision."    "In very plain words, this is an issue we should get behind  us...it's time now to move toward the definition and the  development of our next steps," he added.    He said that the U.S. relationship with China must include  "full engagement" and "constant dialogue."    "A growing economic relationship is anticipated," he  stressed.    However, he cautioned, "we should be realistic about the  economic relationship... There will be disagreements but we  think that a mature and growing relationship can work through  them."    He described this relationship as one that "must be  characterized by a mutual recognition of strategic importance."    Cutter also indicated that the U.S. will "insist upon a  continued focus on democracy and human rights" in its relations  with China.</p>

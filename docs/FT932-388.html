			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Rentokil/Securiguard Rentokil's bid for Securiguard has reached the delicate stage following the latter's interim figures yesterday. Securiguard's 36 per cent rise in first-half earnings and promise of a 22 per cent dividend increase looks designed to prise out more cash. Rentokil has to be careful. It cannot afford to lose its first contested bid, but nor, assuming it will need more than just bolt-on acquisitions from now on, can it be seen to be a soft touch. If the sole criterion was to avoid earnings dilution in the first year, Rentokil could afford to increase its bid to well over 350p from its initial 270p. But that would smack of desperation and implies a price out of line with Securiguard's underlying growth prospects. There must be doubts about the sustainability of the 135 per cent first-half growth in its communications business. The personnel division is still losing money and prison services have not made any yet at all. Rentokil faces an uphill struggle in bringing Securiguard's margins of between 5 and 6 per cent in cleaning and security closer to its own norm of around 25 per cent. To generate the requisite growth, the acquisition must also open the possibility of increased volume. Security, a new activity for Rentokil, might unlock some opportunities but success is far from certain. At least the stability of Securiguard's share price suggests yesterday's figures will not force Rentokil to put a substantial increase on the table.</p>

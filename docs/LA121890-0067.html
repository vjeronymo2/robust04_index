			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'LIFESTORIES' SPONSORS MAY DRAW FIRE FROM CHRISTIAN GROUPS  </P> <P> Although he had yet to see tonight's episode of "Lifestories," Rev. Donald  Wildmon, a leading proponent of boycotts of corporations that advertise on TV  shows that some Christian organizations find objectionable, hinted that its  sponsors might find themselves on his hit list.  </P> <P> "I have no problem with the depiction of the treatment of AIDS in a realistic  manner," Wildmon said from his office in Tupelo, Miss.  </P> <P> "The problem I have with the networks is that every program that I know of  depicts homosexuality as a positive, normal, acceptable, approved, alternative  lifestyle, and that is not in harmony with what the overwhelming majority of  the American people believe.  </P> <P> "If the message is not included in there that the best way to avoid AIDS is to  refrain from homosexual activity, then I think the program is seriously  deficient and harmful to the very people they are trying to help."  </P> <P> Wildmon is the executive director of Christian Leaders for Responsible  Television (CLeaR-TV) and president of the American Family Assn., which monitor  television for what Wildmon calls "sexual immorality, violence, positive  portrays of homosexuals, hedonism, materialism and anti-Christian bigotry."  They identify advertisers and organize boycotts against those that are deemed  to be heavy sponsors of such programs.  </P> <P> Wildmon said that his organizations are tracking all programs that  sympathetically depict the gay lifestyle and will identify the leading sponsor  of such programs. Asked if he will then call for a boycott, Wildmon replied,  "That's what we're known for." STEVE WEINSTEIN  </P></p>

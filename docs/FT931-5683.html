			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong closes at a new high for 1993 CONCERN about earnings at leading blue chip exporters prompted late selling and the Nikkei average lost ground for the third consecutive day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average closed 10.33 easier at 16,853.92 after a high for the day of 16,949.33 set in the morning session and a low of 16,811.98 in the afternoon. The index firmed in the morning on active buying in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone stocks, but later lost ground as the yen strengthened above the Y117 level against the dollar. Trading volume totalled 240m shares, against Tuesday's 228m. Declines outnumbered advances by 497 to 458, with 183 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 3.24 to 1,272.58, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index ended 0.88 off at 1,017.16. Interest in NTT and companies linked to telecommunications supported the market in early trading. Comments by Mr Kabun Muto, head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's tax system research commission, calling for NTT to buy shares held by the government, together with a rise in city-call rates, boosted sentiment. NTT finished Y24,000 ahead at Y682,000 on trading of 54,624 shares, the heaviest since April 21, 1987. Nomura Research Institute said a range between Y680,000 to Y770,000 reflected NTT's business and financial fundamentals. Companies with close ties to NTT also gained ground, with Nippon Comsys firming Y4 to Y731 and Kyowa Exeo advancing Y11 to Y870. Cable companies were strong, with Mitsubishi Cable gaining Y5 at Y585 and Fujikura Y10 at Y579. The stronger yen helped electric utilities, which would see lower fuel import costs due to a higher currency. The electric power sector advanced 1.36 per cent, with Tokyo Electric Power appreciating Y70 to Y2,680 and Kansai Electric Power Y40 to Y2,420. However, high-technology exporters slipped on fears of lower earnings. Matsushita Electric Industrial weakened Y30 to Y1,010 and TDK dropped Y190 to Y3,000. Mazda Motor retreated Y11 to Y412 on its announcement that it had terminated negotiations with Ford Motor, of the US, to start a European vehicle production venture. In Osaka, the OSE average receded 60.17 to 17,926.65 in volume of 35.3m shares. The higher yen hurt Nintendo, the video game maker, which declined Y170 to Y9,720. Roundup SOME Pacific Rim markets managed strong advances but others were more restrained. HONG KONG moved ahead to set a 1993 high, encouraged by forecasts of strong economic growth by Mr Hamish Macleod, the financial secretary, in his 1993 budget speech, and by the view that Mr Chris Patten, the governor, was showing signs of agreeing to some Chinese conditions for talks on the colony's political future. The Hang Seng index rose 92.41, or 1.46 per cent, to 6,436.64, helped by strong US institutional demand. Turnover was high at HKDollars 3.7bn. The Hang Seng's all-time closing peak of 6,447 was set on November 12, before the Sino-British row wiped more than 20 per cent from stock values. Among the most active issues, Citic Pacific was 60 cents higher at HKDollars 16.50, HSBC up HK1.50 at HKDollars 66 and Hutchison Whampoa 10 cents ahead at HKDollars 17.90. TAIWAN was the centre of very heavy speculative demand that took shares 5.5 per cent higher in a round of bargain hunting after Tuesday's 3.8 per cent fall. The weighted index ended 237.62 stronger at an eight-month high of 4,582.61. Turnover remained heavy, although it was down from Tuesday's TDollars 93.1bn to TDollars 74bn. MANILA was another firm spot and the composite index advanced 44.72, or 3 per cent, to 1,518.67. Manila Electric 'B' shares rose 15 pesos to 295 pesos on expectations of good 1992 earnings and rumours of a stock dividend. AUSTRALIAN shares retreated steadily during the day as the Labor party's rise in the opinion polls provoked a round of profit-taking. The All Ordinaries index opened briefly higher, taking its lead from Wall Street's overnight performance, but it soon turned down to finish a net 18.9 lower at 1,626.1 in modest turnover of ADollars 312.2m. SINGAPORE ended little changed after failing to sustain gains made in the afternoon from selective buying. The Straits Times Industrial index lost 0.76 at 1,652.05. BANGKOK relinquished the gains made on Tuesday, the SET index shedding 16.49  -half of it in afternoon trade - to 905.99 in sluggish trade.</p>

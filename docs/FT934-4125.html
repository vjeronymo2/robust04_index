			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Malawi violence kills 32 Malawi's government was yesterday trying to salvage credibility after a weekend of violence which left a total of 32 people dead and more than 100 injured, Nick Young writes from Lilongwe. Mr Hetherwick Ntaba, foreign minister, insisted that the government was in control, and that the army had pledged support for President Hastings Banda and the three-man presidential council which has held executive power since Dr Banda was taken ill in October. Statements from the Presidential Council claim the government endorsed army assaults on bases of the Malawi Young Pioneers, the 2,000-strong armed wing of the ruling Malawi Congress party. During the operation, the party's Lilongwe headquarters were ransacked by regular soldiers, the Lilongwe Youth Ministry was stormed and destroyed, and one of Dr Banda's state residences, in the northern town of Mzuzu, was reported to have been burned down. State radio yesterday said Major General Isaac Yohane, the army commander, claimed still to control the forces, although during the action regular soldiers had told the Financial Times that they were taking orders from Major John Msonthi, and that Maj Gen Yohane was under house arrest.</p>

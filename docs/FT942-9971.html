			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / TV news with a European identity crisis: The outlook for Europe's answer to CNN of the US Up a country lane in the village of Ecully near the south eastern French city of Lyons are 150 people with high ambition struggling to match their high-tech. As Euronews, Europe's first multilingual satellite TV news channel, set up 16 months ago, their ambition is to be Europe's equivalent to CNN of the US. However, despite a subsidy from the European Union, Euronews overran its budget last year by FFr50m, (Pounds 5.85m) and the deficit this year will be bigger. RAI and RTVE, the Italian and Spanish state TV networks which are two of Euronews's four main shareholders, are dragging their feet on a much-needed capital increase. Euronews claims to reach an audience of 13.9m households through cable and 57m through terrestrial re-broadcast of its programmes, throughout the continent of Europe and north Africa. It does now, however, face something of an identity crisis, akin to that of Europe itself. Is there enough of a common European consciousness for its future to lie in continuing to pump out programming - identical in everything but the soundtracks in five languages - 20 hours a day to the whole of its potential market? Or, as another main shareholder, France Television, now argues, would it not be better for Euronews to take on more national colouring to suit the big individual European markets? Certainly, Euronews has no shortage of national material to draw on. Conceived by the public television members of the European Broadcasting Union, the Geneva-based grouping of 67 broadcasters, it is hooked into the EBU's daily Eurovision auction of programmes, as well as subscribing to the Reuters and WTN television services. In addition, it can take material directly from its four big shareholders - the fourth is SSR of Switzerland - and 11 smaller ones that now include networks in three north African countries and one from Slovenia, the ex-Yugoslav republic. But the very breadth of this material makes it hard for Euronews to establish a distinctive personality. Mr Jean-Claude Silvain, Euronews's administrative and financial director, wonders whether 'there is such a thing as a European point of view on news' in the way that CNN, even CNN International, often seems to be 'the view from Atlanta'. To a far lesser extent, Euronews is the view from Brussels or Strasbourg, home cities respectively of Europe's Commission and Parliament. Euronews broadcasts news on the EU and has a regular magazine programme on EU institutions. Much Strasbourg coverage has been less than compulsive viewing, and has more to do with the subsidy to Euronews which the EU just doubled to FFr30m for this year. Mr Silvain would like to alter the nature of Euronews's relationship with the EU so that 'instead of us getting automatically rewarded by Brussels simply for broadcasting in five Community languages, we would be paid for offering a genuine service'. That, however, raises the question of whether, or when, Euronews would have the resources to offer original programming. Mr Peter Vickers, Euronews's English language editor and the man responsible for news and current affairs, says the station will offer its own special programmes on the European Parliament election campaign this month and next. But Euronews is uncertain whether to try to rise to the challenge of offering pan-European coverage of Euro-election results on the day. 'It's obviously a big opportunity for us,' says a journalist at Ecully, 'but equally, we could fall flat on our faces.' There is a technical cause for Euronews's relative lack of personality. None of its journalists can appear on camera, for the obvious reason that they cannot speak five languages at the same time. Nor is dubbing possible; as one of the Ecully journalists says, 'it takes 15 seconds to say in German what can be said in English in 10 seconds'. Without 'talking heads' to fill in inevitable gaps, Euronews has had to make far greater use of graphics than, say, CNN. 'Some 20-30 per cent of total output is taken up with tables, charts, maps, election results, or just credits,' says Mr Patrick Lefko, its art director. To fill the gaps in its finances as well as its programmes, Euronews would like more advertising. The company gives no figures on this, but Mr Richard White, Euronews advertising director, claims that advertising revenue for pan-European satellite stations is currently only between Dollars 120 and Dollars 150m a year, and even that is inflated by business booked in the US by CNN for its international service. Advertising revenues in national European markets are, of course, much greater, and better adaptation to national markets is precisely what France Television, under its new boss, Mr Jean-Pierre Elkabbach, is now urging on Euronews. His particular interest is to use France Television's stake in Euronews to match plans by the dominant French private station, TF1, to start up an all-news channel this summer. France Television has no intention of increasing the one hour of straight Euronews it carries on its FR3 regular channel already, says a spokesman, but rather to take the Euronews cable service and to adapt it 'by mixing in more of our own national programming and news to attract more French viewers'. France Television has dubbed this hybrid plan 'Euronews France', and sees no reason why similar hybrids of 'Euronews Deutschland' or even 'Euronews Britain' could not one day induce German TV stations and the BBC to drop their stand-offish attitude to Euronews. The latter would then, says France Television, become just another 'banque d'images' (picture bank) for Europe's national networks. That would hardly satisfy the ambitions of those at Ecully. But for the near future, they may find they have to choose survival rather than satisfaction.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> HELP SOUGHT IN FINDING MAN WHO EXPOSES SELF  </P> <P> Police issued a public appeal Tuesday for help in locating a man who has been  indecently exposing himself to women in the city since 1983.  </P> <P> Investigator Linda Faust said 30 to 40 cases have been reported during the last  six years, "and I'd be surprised if that's more than a quarter of the actual  incidents. I think he's out there all the time."  </P> <P> She described the man as in his late 30s to mid-40s with sandy-blond hair that  has been receding over the years. He wears glasses, has a mustache and, in  recent weeks, has been wearing a beard.  </P> <P> Faust said the man drives in one of two vehicles: an early 1980s copper-colored  Datsun 280ZX or an early 1980s white, full-size Chevrolet Blazer with a brown  stripe. He apparently removes the license plates before going out to seek  victims, Faust said. "He's obviously thinking this out," she said.  </P> <P> Naked from the waist down, he drives his car up to women, who typically are  jogging or walking along the street, jumps out of the car, exposes himself,  then races away, Faust said.  </P> <P> The incidents have occurred in the city's northeast and southwest sections and  seem to be limited to Santa Ana, Faust said. All known victims have been  adults.  </P> <P> "We figure somebody's got to know him," Faust said. "Those are distinctive  vehicles, and he has enough going with the beard and the glasses."  </P> <P> She asked anyone with information on the suspect to contact her or investigator  Frank Stastny at the Santa Ana Police Department.  </P></p>

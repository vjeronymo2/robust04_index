			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Gyngell urges more cuts at BBC THE BBC should make even deeper cuts in staffing and move to multi-skilling, Mr Bruce Gyngell, chairman of TV-am, said last night, Raymond Snoddy writes. In a speech to the Royal Television Society he said the BBC should survive and be properly funded by a licence fee. But it did not need 24,000 people to sustain its vision. He said Mr John Birt, the director-general designate, appeared to have said big cuts could be on the way. Mr Gyngell added: 'But I was amazed to hear Sir Michael Checkland (the current director-general) say the other day that all 14 studios owned by the BBC would be an integral and vital part of the of the BBC's future.' He said: 'Multi-skilling, combined with the proper use of studios is the future. Only in this way will the cost of productions be brought down to fully competitive levels, so that the BBC can continue to make the quality and range of programmes it does now.' Mr Gyngell warned the BBC against moving away from truly popular programming. Audiences would shrink and the licence fee would become more difficult to defend. The only way ITV would become fully competitive would be when the English ITV companies merged into four groupings covering the north, the Midlands, the south and London.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by pw: "Dispute About Supervision Over Army; What </F> Goryszewski Will Write"]    [Text] Henryk Goryszewski, chief of the National  Security Bureau [BBN], which is associated with the Belweder, is  writing a law on who will exercise supervision over the Army.  "It is like telling a fox to guard a henhouse," say coalition  Sejm deputies.    Yesterday, the National Defense Committee [KOK], which  includes the president, the prime minister, Sejm and Senate  speakers, the chief of the General Staff, the BBN chief, and the  four most important ministers, adopted a document prepared by  the National Defense Ministry [MON] entitled "Fundamental  Problems of Poland's Defense System."    It is an assessment of the country's security and a  demonstration of future directions for reforming the defense  system, said Henryk Goryszewski at a press conference. We  recommended the document to the Council of Ministers. We  deleted only one or two little pages....    But the problem is that these "little pages" relate to the  most important issues, among them, who is to be the boss of the  chief of the General Staff (Army commander): Is it the defense  minister or the president?    KOK made a decision that Goryszewski will prepare a law  dealing with all types of conflicts of powers and that he will  present it in two weeks. According to unconfirmed sources, MON  chief Piotr Kolodziejczyk was the author of the idea; he is  clearly getting impatient with the ongoing debate on supervision  of the Army. Prime Minister Pawlak supported Kolodziejczyk  because he did not want to be at odds with the president.    The Council of Ministers Defense Issues Committee adopted a  document entitled "Concerning Problems of the Country's  Security" more than a month ago. In the document, the committee  noted that an army's subordination to the defense minister is  typical for European countries.    But Goryszewski is in favor of the Army's subordination to  the president: One should counteract party influence over the  Army. After all, the government in this country consists of  parties and party coalitions.    In Goryszewski's view, MON has so far not come up with a  draft law that would define the powers of the president and the  minister. But, among the appendixes to the "Fundamental  Problems..." there is such a draft law that contradicts the  president's ideas.    Prolonging the dispute is very dangerous to the Polish Army,  says former Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz of the Freedom  Union. All of this should be settled soon, while the chief of  the General Staff should be subordinated to the minister, just  like it is done in a majority of European countries.    Well, KOK wants that, so let Goryszewski write, write,  write..., Jerzy Szmajdzinski (Democratic Left Alliance),  chairman of the Sejm Defense Commission, told GAZETA WYBORCZA in  an indolent tone.</p>

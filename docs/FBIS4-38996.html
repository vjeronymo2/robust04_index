			<p>BFN     [Text] The Moscow prosecutor's office adopted a resolution  dropping all charges against the opposition leaders who spoke at  the May 9 meeting in Moscow in accordance with Article 70 of the  Russian Criminal Code (appeals for violent change of the  constitutional system).    Moscow's deputy prosecutor Yuriy Andreyechev reported to  Interfax that investigators had found prosecutable crimes in the  statements of, in particular, former vice president Aleksandr  Rutskoy, and the leaders of Labor Russia Viktor Anpilov and of  the National Salvation Front Iliya Konstantinov.    At the May 9 meeting in Moscow Rutskoy called for a marking  of the 50th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany with a  victory over Yeltsin's "anti-popular regime." Rutskoy said in  the prosecutor's office that he did not mean a coercive  overthrow of the existing government but called to fight for  power by constitutional methods.</p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLAG BURNING AS PROTEST UPHELD;  </P> <P> HIGH COURT TAKES STRONG STAND FOR FREE EXPRESSION IN TWO CASES  </P> <P> The Supreme Court, taking a strong pro-First Amendment stand in two tough tests  of free expression, ruled Wednesday that flag burning is protected by the  Constitution as a form of political protest.  </P> <P> And, in a second decision, the justices said that a newspaper may not be  punished for reporting the name of a rape victim that was obtained from police.  </P> <P> The two rulings suggest that the high court is continuing to take a broad view  of the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of speech and the press, even as it  cuts back on earlier civil rights positions. Two of former President Ronald  Reagan's appointees -- Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy -- joined  the majority in Wednesday's rulings.  </P> <P> The flag-burning case, which began as a symbolic radical protest at the 1984  Republican National Convention in Dallas, became a classic test for the  justices over the true meaning of the flag and the First Amendment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Symbol of Free Speech  </P> <P> The five justices in the majority said that the flag symbolizes the nation's  commitment to free speech and debate, which requires protecting even  "offensive" and "disagreeable" political ideas.  </P> <P> "The way to preserve the flag's special role is not to punish those who feel  differently about these matters. It is to persuade them that they are wrong,"  Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote for the majority.  </P> <P> Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, in dissent, said that he could not fathom  how a government that can order soldiers to "fight and perhaps die for the  flag" may not punish persons for "the public burning of the banner under which  they fight."  </P> <P> Wednesday's ruling was a surprise to most civil libertarians and appears to  strike down as unconstitutional similar laws enacted by the federal government  and every state except Alaska and Wyoming making it a crime to burn or  desecrate a flag.  </P> <P> "The death of civil liberties was premature," said University of Colorado Law  Dean Gene Nichol, a First Amendment expert. "This was a decision that the  Warren Court was scared to make."  </P> <P> During the 1960s, the Supreme Court and then-Chief Justice Earl Warren dodged  rulings on whether burning a flag was a protected form of protest. Twenty years  later, when radical protests have faded and patriotic support for the flag has  reached a peak, a more conser vative court has decided to settle the question.  </P> <P> The case began during the week that Republicans gathered in Dallas to nominate  Reagan for a second term. A small band of radical protesters marched through  the streets chanting: "America, the red, white and blue. We spit on you." They  seized a flag from a bank building, set it on fire and watched it burn. For  this act, a protest leader, Gregory Johnson, was arrested, convicted, fined  $2,000 and sentenced to one year in jail for violating Texas law.  </P> <P> Johnson's case reached the Supreme Court last October while Republican  presidential candidate George Bush was making the flag a key campaign issue and  was denouncing his Democratic opponent, Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis,  for having vetoed as unconstitutional a law mandating that all school children  be required to recite the Pledge of Allegiance each day.  </P> <P> Civil libertarians and political radicals feared that the current conservative  court would use the case to cut back on the right to protest mainstream views.  Instead, the high court reaffirmed its 40-year-old doctrine that free  expression is protected so long as it does not create a clear danger of  "imminent lawless action."  </P> <P> Johnson had engaged in an "overtly political" act of "symbolic speech," which,  while offensive to many, did not threaten to "incite a riot," Brennan wrote for  the majority.  </P> <P> "If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment," he added, "it  is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply  because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seen as Strengthening Flag  </P> <P> The 83-year-old Brennan, who read much of his opinion from the bench Wednesday,  said that the American flag has a "deservedly cherished place in our community"  but that the flag would be "strengthened, not weakened, by our holding today.  Our decision is a reaffirmation of the principles of freedom and inclusiveness  that the flag best reflects and of the conviction that our toleration of  criticisms such as Johnson's is a sign and source of our strength."  </P> <P> Kennedy, although joining the opinion, said in a concurring statement that he  found the outcome "distasteful" but was nevertheless compelled to concur by the  "pure command of the Constitution."  </P> <P> "The hard fact is that sometimes we must make decisions we do not like,"  Kennedy said.  </P> <P> In dissent, Rehnquist derided Brennan for giving a "regrettably patronizing  civics lecture" on free speech and the flag. He argued that, although  protesters are entirely free to speak ill of the President, the Republican  Party or the flag itself, they are not free to burn a flag.  </P> <P> "The American flag, then, throughout more than 200 years of our history, has  come to be the visible symbol embodying our nation," Rehnquist wrote. "The flag  is not simply another 'idea' or 'point of view' competing for recognition in  the marketplace of ideas."  </P> <P> In a second eloquent and emotional dissent, which was read from the bench,  Justice John Paul Stevens said that creating a right to put "graffiti on the  Washington Monument" or "spray paint on the Lincoln Memorial . . . might  enlarge the market for free expression, but at a cost I would not pay.  Similarly, in my considered judgment, sanctioning the public desecration of the  flag will tarnish its value . . . . That tarnish is not justified by the  trivial burden on free expression occasioned by requiring that an available,  alternative mode of expression -- including uttering words critical of the flag  -- be employed."  </P> <P> Joining Brennan and Kennedy to form the majority in the case (Texas vs.  Johnson, 88-155) were Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and Scalia.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Liberal Activists Pleased  </P> <P> Liberal legal activists, who were angry at the court last week because of its  rulings on civil rights, said that they were pleased with the decision  Wednesday.  </P> <P> "Today's ruling is a victory for free speech. Offensive or not, those who burn  the flag to express their views are exercising a right that our founding  generation fought a revolution to secure," said Arthur Kropp, president of  People for the American Way.  </P> <P> Radical lawyer William Kunstler of the Center for Constitutional Rights, who  defended Johnson, said that the ruling prohibits "the state from making the  flag a religious icon. It holds (that) our Constitution allows the people to  choose and express whatever meaning they choose for the flag, even where that  expression is deeply critical of the country for which it stands."  </P> <P> Lawyers representing the Veterans of Foreign Wars and AMVETS called the ruling  "an outrage."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Carte Blanche to Protesters  </P> <P> "Americans have a unique reverence for the flag, and the court seems to have  treated it as just another symbol," said Alan Slobodin of the Washington Legal  Foundation, which filed a court brief for the veterans' groups. "This opinion  appears to give carte blanche to all kinds of extreme protest, whether it is  KKK demonstrators burning a picture of Martin Luther King or Nazis marching in  Skokie."  </P> <P> In the past, the court has said that police may limit protests and marches to  ensure public safety but that they may not ban a form of protest simply because  of its disagreeable message.  </P> <P> In the other First Amendment case, the court said that a news organization may  not be punished for accurately reporting the name of a rape victim lawfully  obtained from police.  </P> <P> The 6-3 vote reversed a Florida court verdict awarding $97,500 to a  Jacksonville woman whose name was reported, inadvertently, by a small weekly  newspaper.  </P> <P> Florida makes it a crime to release or publish the names of rape victims. In  this case, the police mistakenly released the name, and the newspaper, in  violation its own policy, printed it.  </P> <P> The case was seen as a potentially major test of a newspaper's constitutional  right to print truthful information versus a victim's right to privacy.  However, Justice Marshall said that the court's ruling is "limited." Because  the government itself had released the information, the justices concluded that  the paper could not be fined for printing it.  </P> <P> The opinion (Florida Star vs. B.J.F., 87-329) adheres to a series of rulings  from the late 1970s upholding the news media in printing court documents, but  it stops short of giving the press absolute immunity when it prints accurate  information. Justices Byron R. White and Sandra Day O'Connor joined Rehnquist  in the dissent.  </P> <P> In other action Wednesday, the court:  </P> <P>  -- Ruled, 8 to 0, that the American Bar Assn. may continue to meet secretly  and give advice to the Justice Department on potential judicial candidates  (Public Citizen vs. Justice Department, 88-429). Both liberal and conservative  legal groups have said that the ABA should be considered an official advisory  body and hold open meetings.  </P> <P>  -- Ruled, 5 to 4, that railroads may sell off parts of their lines without  bargaining with their unions (P&amp;LE vs. Railway Labor Executives, 87-1859).  </P> <P> OPINION EXCERPTS -- Portions of majority and minority opinions.

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Italians mark liberation Hundreds of thousands of Italians took to the streets yesterday to commemorate the liberation of the country from fascism 49 years ago and, in many cases, to protest peacefully against the victory of the right-wing Freedom Alliance in last month's Italian election. Italy's left and centre parties, roundly defeated by the Freedom Alliance at the polls, were prominent in yesterday's demonstrations. In Milan, where heavy rain failed to deter tens of thousands from attending one of the largest rallies in the city since the 1970s, representatives of the federalist Northern League, another member of the Freedom Alliance, were barracked and jostled by demonstrators. Mr Umberto Bossi, the League's leader, had to be escorted by riot police to the cathedral square, focus of yesterday's events, after he and League officials were surrounded by a crowd whistling and shouting 'fascisti' and 'buffoni' (fools). The far-right National Alliance, inheritor of the neo-fascist MSI and one of the three victorious parties in the Freedom Alliance, called yesterday for the April 25 national holiday to be transformed into a 'festival of reconciliation'.</p>

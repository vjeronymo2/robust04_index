			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today the Senate resumed its plenary session. At  the opening of the session, upon a proposal made by Senator  Constantin Ticu Dumitrescu, the senators marked their regret  over the persons who fell in the struggle against Communism by  standing silently for a minute. Following this, they resumed  discussing the draft bill on the organization and functioning of  the Romanian Police.    An amendment proposed by the Democratic Union of Hungarians  in Romania [UDMR] parliamentary group stirred a fierce dispute  among the senators. Among other things, the amendment  stipulates that, quote, in the territorial-administrative units  in which the ethnic minority inhabitants represent the majority  as compared to the total number of the population, the newly  appointed or employed personnel of the police must be able to  speak the language of that ethnic minority, respectively, must  come, in a sufficient number, from among the persons belonging  to that ethnic minority, unquote.    However, the amendment was then rejected, as merely 16  senators voted in its favor.    The debate continued after a short break. The most important  article that was discussed by the end of the morning session  referred to the sentencing to life imprisonment of persons who  kill police officers in the exercise of their duty.    Our correspondent, Victor Spirache, also reports that, after  discussions were suspended on that draft bill, a number of  senators made statements in their own name on various issues.</p>

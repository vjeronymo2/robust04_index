			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour rounds on Tories over jobs GOVERNMENT ministers were accused by Labour last night of encouraging a 'climate of fear' over unemployment, homelessness and business failures, that lay 'at the root' of Britain's economic and social problems', Ralph Atkins writes. As Labour intensified its campaign against unemployment Mrs Margaret Beckett, the party's deputy leader, said Britain 'should be planning to prosper, and not just struggling to get by.' At a rally in Swindon she linked rising joblessness and crime, saying the Conservatives 'have encouraged us to abandon our basic sense of shared concern, of responsibility one for another.' Labour plans further rallies in Tory marginal seats where unemployment has risen dramatically.</p>

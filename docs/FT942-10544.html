			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Disposal helps API to 54% interim growth The disposal of its heating and ventilating business helped API Group, the packaging, coatings and office products company, to lift interim profits by 54 per cent. Pre-tax surplus for the six months ended April 2 rose from Pounds 1.97m to Pounds 3.01m, while turnover improved 14 per cent to Pounds 37.4m (Pounds 32.8m), with Pounds 1.39m (Pounds 1.78m) from discontinued activities. Mr Michael Smith, chief executive, said he was pleased with the growth adding that the second half was traditionally stronger. The group had the capacity to make sales of Pounds 100m 'with very little capital expenditure'. Operating profits were Pounds 2.81m (Pounds 1.97m), including Pounds 185,000 from Diffusion Environmental Systems, the heating and ventilating business sold in February for Pounds 1.5m cash, giving a profit of Pounds 815,000 after expenses. Earnings per share rose from 6.4p to 9.55p. The interim dividend is lifted from 3.35p to 3.7p. The foils and laminates division, which makes packaging, reported operating profits up from Pounds 1.37m to Pounds 2.11m on turnover of Pounds 24m (Pounds 20m). Mr Smith said the division had benefited from new products and growth in market share. It had also worked hard to keep stocks down and to speed up response times. The coatings and office products division improved sales from Pounds 11m to Pounds 12m, with operating profits just ahead at Pounds 1.17m (Pounds 1.14m). The division suffered from the volatility of the Swedish krone, which had a negative effect equivalent to Pounds 230,000 on Tenza, based in Sweden.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Daniel Espichan Tumay, special prosecutor </F> for terrorist crimes by "L.C.R.;" place and date not given]    [Text] [L.C.R.] Mr. Espichan, you have been involved in the  permanent struggle against subversion for many years. We now  seem to be at the threshold of a pacification. What can you tell  us about this?    [Espichan] I do not want to sound over-optimistic, but just  looking at the statistics I can say we have achieved 97 percent  progress in our struggle against the Shining Path [SL] and 99  percent regarding the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. The  key of this struggle, of course, was President Alberto  Fujimori's decision to begin political and administrative  changes and, at the same time, conduct the struggle against  terrorism from the head of his government. History will confirm  that there was a time before and after President Fujimori made  his political decision.    [L.C.R] I believe every government over the past 14 years  has  made a contribution.    [Espichan] Everything failed during the 1980-90 period. Laws  were issued that were contradictory from the legal viewpoint.  These laws were full of mistakes that prevented us from  confronting the terrorists and punishing them adequately. After  that came the political decision, that is, on 5 April and,  especially, after 6 May 1992 with three important resolutions:  Decree Law No. 25475 issued on 6 May 1992, Decree Law No. 25499,  the "Repentance Law," that was issued just six days later on 12  May 1992, and Decree Law No. 25659, the "Treason Against the  Fatherland Law" which legally specifies terrorism and allows  this crime to be tried by military courts.    [L.C.R] Some people believe these decrees are too harsh and  that, consequently, they could have a boomerang effect.    [Espichan] These legal measures, especially Decree Laws Nos.  25475 and 25659 are harsh, but they are what the citizenry  demanded because terrorism had already reached Lima. In 1991, it  felt almost as if we were being defeated by the SL and somebody  had to do something about it and say: Stop, either democracy  prevails or we let terrorism take over the country. The final  decision was taken by the president when he implemented the  structural, political, and administrative changes in our country  on 5 April.    [L.C.R.] President Fujimori obviously enjoyed the Armed  Forces' support at that time.    [Espichan] What is quite obvious now is that the Armed  Forces  are playing a very significant role. If this had not been the  case, we would not be heading toward a true pacification. We  must mention the brilliant and intelligent performance of a  brave man who not only sits behind his desk giving his Army  orders at a nationwide level, but personally goes to the theater  of operations to give orders and find out what is going on. I am  talking about Army General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza Rios, a  brilliant military officer who must be paid the highest  compliments for his success as the representative of the Armed  Forces.    [L.C.R.] What about the civilians, have they also responded  to this struggle?    [Espichan] The citizenry is another component in this  struggle. The citizens' brave, heroic attitude makes them even  more worthy, considering the suffering they endure. Despite the  poverty in which we live as a result of terrorism, the low  salaries, and the many shortcomings, the citizenry has lost its  fear of terrorism.    [L.C.R.] Also in Ayacucho?    [Espichan] In Ayacucho and other Andean regions that were  severely tormented by terrorism, the people rejoice over the  peace they now enjoy. Of course others rejoice over being able  to return to their home towns, being able to pick up their  abandoned businesses, being able to peacefully walk the streets.    [L.C.R.] Many assert that terrorism is not yet fully  defeated.    [Espichan] That is true. Terrorism has yet to be defeated. I  am realistic and admit there are still a few fanatics,  psychopaths, but they will not succeed in Peru. There have been  many changes, especially regarding the causes that gave origin  to terrorism. Peru is a different country today, both  domestically and internationally. This is why I repeatedly tell  every terrorist to repent now that they are defeated and return  to their families who need them.    [L.C.R.] The leaders greatly influence them.    [Espichan] No way. I believe terrorists have already  realized  that the while they give their lives for mistaken causes, the  leadership gets drunk on fine wines and lives in residences that  only wealthy people can afford, that they only struggle in  theory and deceive their followers. This is why so many  repentant terrorists have surrendered and rejoined society, the  fatherland.</p>

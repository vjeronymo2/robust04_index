			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad Nazzal, official spokesman for the </F> Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, by unidentified reporter in  Amman; date not given]    [Text]    AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Was the 'Afula bombing a  reprisal for the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre or does it fall within  the framework of a strategy? Or is it a novel mode of militancy  against the Israeli occupation?    [Nazzal: The 'Afula operation executed by the  al-Qassam Battalions -- Hamas' military wing -- was the first  reprisal for the Hebron massacre. Four more, just as forceful  and impressive, are yet to come.    AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Some Palestinians have spoken  out against an operation that targeted civilians and cast the  conflict in racial terms, pitting Arab against Israeli, when in  actual fact it is one of liberation, and so armed struggle in  all its forms must be directed at only the occupation military.  How do you react?    [Nazzal: In the 40-day interval between the Hebron  massacre and the 'Afula bombing, the Palestinian people realized  the international community is not about to take revenge for  them or compensate them in any way. A statement of condemnation  was all that the UN Security Council did, which made no  difference. Therefore, all segments of the Palestinian people  rejoiced at the operation and saw in it something of a morale  booster. The Palestinians who came out against it are a  scattered minority whom the operation put on the spot and pulled  the rug from under them.    AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Can you state with certainty  that the next operations will be modelled on the 'Afula  operation?    [Nazzal: All I can say is that they will be  forceful enough to match the enormity and odiousness of the  Hebron massacre.    AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: You have a significant  political presence in Jordan and Syria, both of which are  involved in the peace process. It appears the 'Afula operation  has had the consequence of pushing Washington to move against  you in the two countries. Have you come under any official  pressure?    [Nazzal: As I have said, the operation was greeted  with universal jubilation in Arab and Muslim circles, because it  was in response to the crime and to avenge the martyrs. Sadly,  however, the PLO was the only Arab quarter to deplore this  heroic action.    AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: But you haven't come under any  official pressure?    [Nazzal: None of the Arab states has criticized us  or applied any pressure on account of the 'Afula operation.    AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Information suggests the PLO  has complained to Jordan because of your national political role  in the Jordanian arena. Have you been informed of this  complaint?    [Nazzal: We learned about this complaint through  unofficial sources, but no one has contacted us in this  connection. If anything, this shows the PLO leadership is  facing a serious predicament, to the extent that it is lodging  complaints with the U.S. Administration to pressure Jordan. I  think Jordan understands the position of the Hamas movement on  the political settlement and pursuing the resistance against the  occupation.    AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: After the 'Afula operation,  Israel has once again reiterated that your movement receives  financial support from Iran and that those who planned and  carried out the operation had received training by Hizballah  when they were in Marj al-Zuhur in southern Lebanon. How true  is this?    [Nazzal: I do not believe the Hamas movement is  incapable of developing its security and military capabilities.  The movement has a highly qualified military agency which is  gaining more experience day after day. Therefore, talking about  Iranian or foreign financing is not true.    AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Then where does your financing  come from?    [Nazzal: I can stress that Hamas finances itself  by itself and from popular quarters. So far we have not  received a penny from any government.    AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Some reports say Hamas is  involved in schemes to finish off Yasir 'Arafat in order to  abort the peace process. How true is this?    [Nazzal: Hamas does not believe in political  assassination. It thinks its efforts should be geared toward  facing the occupation and its tools. What is being said about a  plan to assassinate 'Arafat or other Palestinian personalities  is unfounded.    AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: But how are you going to deal  with the fact that 'Arafat and the Palestinian leadership will  soon be in Gaza and Jericho, and then the rest of the West Bank?    [Nazzal: It is Hamas policy not to clash with  Palestinian authority and its tools. This, however, does not at  all mean that the resistance will stop. Therefore, Hamas will  pursue its approach to resist the occupation until the objective  of removing the occupation is achieved.    AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Do you have any information to  prove that 'Arafat has agreed with the Israelis to get rid of  Hamas?    [Nazzal: We have information about intelligence  meetings between Palestinian and Israeli security agencies for  coordination against Hamas and to exchange information on Hamas  leaders, cadres, and activities.    AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: To what extent are you afraid  of such meetings, especially during the next phase, when 'Arafat  returns home and controls matters in the West Bank and Gaza?    [Nazzal: Undoubtedly, we view with extreme caution  the cooperation between the Palestinian and the occupation  authorities, as this cooperation will be aimed against any  Palestinian opposition. But we believe the Palestinian masses  will bend toward those who express their hopes and aspirations.  They will eject whoever cooperates with the occupation. We  reflect the Palestinian masses' determination to continue  resistance to the occupation.    AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Some reports mention the  movement of some Fatah Hawks to Hamas because the Tunis  leadership has stopped sending them money, thus restraining  their military movement against Israel. How true is that?    [Nazzal: Definitely, there is large-scale  opposition within the Fatah ranks against the political  settlement. This opposition is expanding to encompass large  sectors. Hamas has relations and contacts with honorable and  sincere Fatah personnel, some of whom have been absorbed within  Hamas, especially military personnel. Hopefully, this will  enrich Hamas' experience, especially after it has been joined by  some experienced Fatah cadres.    AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: It seems the experience of the  Fatah personnel who have joined you has appeared in the 'Afula  operation?    [Nazzal: When any experienced personnel joins  Hamas, this will be a qualitative addition to Hamas' experience.  We believe any cooperation between Hamas and Fatah military  personnel will be a real threat to the occupation and its tools.    AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: You have maintained channels  to Fatah inside in the occupied territories. Do you have  channels to the Fatah command abroad? Have such channels helped  establish coordination between the two movements?    [Nazzal: Official contacts with the Fatah command  abroad have been frozen since the Oslo agreement. We maintain  individual contacts with Fatah oppositionists. But they are  personal contacts.    AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Are you planning to develop  your contacts with the opposition to abort the peace process?    [Nazzal: We welcome any contacts and coordination  with Fatah's oppositionists if that helps the resistance to  occupation.    AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: But are they equally willing  to do that?    [Nazzal: Already some Fatah activists are  coordinating with Hamas.    AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: And on the top leadership  level?    [Nazzal: No coordination there.    AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: You came out against the  reinstatement of Mustafa al-Natshah as Hebron mayor and demanded  municipal elections. How is it that you support municipal  elections that the occupation does not mind, and, at the same  time, you do not want to contest elections for a Palestinian  authority that the occupation also has no objection to?    [Nazzal: We are for municipal elections that are  not tied to any political agenda in particular. This is because  municipal elections are the only means available to provide  services to the Palestinian population, as well as to alleviate  the hardships under which they are living, and enhance their  health and social services. We want municipal elections to be  held in all the Palestinian cities. Elections were held in 1976  without them being tied to any political agenda, at a time when  all Palestinian forces, then adopting the same posture as that  of Hamas now, refused to extend recognition to the Zionist  enemy. Thus we see nothing wrong in holding elections, but they  must be unconnected to any political agenda.    AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Uri Sagi, head of Israeli  intelligence, said in press statements that Hamas will field  candidates in the elections for the Palestinian authority under  a banner that does not bear the name of Hamas. He explains that  the Hamas pragmatists in the occupied territories will press for  participation. What do you think?    [Nazzal: Hamas' position is not to take part in  the self-rule elections -- a decision consistent with our  opposition to the Gaza- Jericho agreement and its spin-offs.  Any word about Hamas contesting these elections is speculative  and not based on hard facts.    AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Is that your last word on the  issue?    [Nazzal: Our position holds for the time being.  I don't know about the future. Everything is subject to a  review.    AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: I take it then that your  participation in the elections is not ruled out?    Nazzal: We are open to all options.</p>

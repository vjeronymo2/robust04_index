			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Japanese discount rate cut to low of 1.75% JAPAN'S central bank cut its official discount rate early today by a larger-than-expected 0.75 percentage points to a new low of 1.75 per cent in an effort to stimulate the depressed economy. Most analysts had expected the rate to be cut by 0.5 percentage points to 2 per cent. The Tokyo stock market rallied after news of the rate cut, with the Nikkei average climbing 250 points to 20,521 in early trading. A central bank official said the cut 'should be appropriate to deal with the current (depressed) state of the economy. It is a big cut, and we see this as a decisive measure.' Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, said the cut would 'contribute significantly to sustainable growth' in Japan in combination with other government measures. Domestic and international pressure for a cut in rates has been rising in line with a stream of gloomy economic indicators. Gross national product fell an annualised 2 per cent in the three months to June and is probably still declining in the current quarter, putting Japan into a 'double dip' recession. The Bank of Japan last cut the discount rate - its key lending rate to commercial banks - on February 4 from 3.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent. The latest cut, the seventh since July 1991, should relieve much of the disappointment that met a government pump-priming package of deregulation, measures to pass on the benefits of the high yen to consumers and Y6,150bn (Pounds 38bn) of public spending announced last week. It included neither a rate cut nor reductions in income tax, as demanded by Japanese industry. Possible tax cuts, a politically divisive issue, are being studied by a government panel. The latest cut will have a psychological impact and help restrain the yen's rise, but seems unlikely to bring a marked cut in companies' borrowing costs. Some businessmen and politicians had urged the central bank to take bold action and cut the rate by as much as one percentage point to help ensure a recovery. Commercial banks are expected to drop their prime rates on October 1, in line with previous practice. However, a decreasing number of banks maintain a tight link between prime and actual lending rates because of the pressure on margins from the need for heavy bad debt provisions.

			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UCLA RESERVE IS CHARGED WITH TWO COUNTS OF BATTERY  </P> <P> Stacey Elliott, a reserve defensive tackle on the UCLA football team, was  booked Tuesday on two counts of battery, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County  Sherriff's office said.  </P> <P> Campus police told the Daily Bruin that Elliott, 21, allegedly grabbed the  buttocks of two women in separate on-campus incidents last summer.  </P> <P> According to the campus newspaper, athletic department officials apparently  advised Elliott to turn himself over to the police, who obtained a warrant for  his arrest on the misdemeanor charges.  </P> <P> Elliott, who was released after posting $6,000 bail, allegedly grabbed the UCLA  students as he walked past them during daylight hours. The incidents did not  appear to be premeditated, police told the Daily Bruin.  </P> <P> Elliott was scheduled to appear today in Division 90 in West Los Angeles  Municipal Court.  </P> <P> Charges were filed Oct. 11, police said, and Elliott was later named as a  suspect in the case after the victims, who were not named, identified him in a  lineup.  </P> <P> The alleged incidents took place last July 31 and Aug. 20.  </P> <P> Elliott, a 6-foot-1 1/2, 252-pound junior, was an All-Southern Section  defensive end at Long Beach Poly High. He has played only sparingly this  season, making seven tackles, and has missed several games because of a bruised  thigh.  </P> <P> Pending a decision by the dean of students, who would decide if disciplinary  action should be taken, Elliott will continue to play for the Bruins, a  spokesman for the athletic department said.  </P></p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (5): Prognosis for pound is good  -Sterling STERLING LOOKS set to enjoy a period of relative stability on world currency markets, amid a healthier outlook for the UK economy and the prospect of a settled political environment. Behind the reappraisal of the pound in recent weeks by many international investors was the Conservatives' surprise win in the April 9 general election. That removed the doubts of some market practitioners that sterling could face a devaluation within the European exchange rate mechanism and sparked an intense period of buying pressure. The pound's consequent rise against the D-Mark - from DM2.83 early in April to around DM2.94 a month afterwards - was the result of the strongest surge of support sterling since the UK joined the ERM in October 1990. Helping sterling has been the general sentiment that Britain is starting a slow recovery from its serious recession. Such a conclusion has been supported by several economic indicators in recent months, notably a sizeable 3 per cent quarter-on-quarter increase in underlying import volumes in the first three months of 1992. There is also the perception that Britain - unlike other European nations including France and Italy - faces a relatively long period without an election. As a result, purchasing support for the pound relative to other European currencies has been healthy. Sterling has also benefited indirectly from the problems facing the German economy as a result of unification. These appear to have weakened the role of the D-Mark in the ERM and have strengthened other currencies in the system. It was partly because of the markets' perception that the role of the D-Mark might have lost some of its importance that the pound weathered the interest-rate cut on May 5. The reduction brought UK base rates from 10.5 per cent to 10 per cent in the first such fall since September. It narrowed the gap between UK rates and the corresponding 9.75 per cent German Lombard rate to just a quarter of a point, the lowest level since 1981. For all the stronger tone of sterling, its rapid rise in the month after the election should be regarded in the context of the poor period in the six months before the poll. During this time, investors sold sterling in large volumes because of worries about a possible change of government and doubts about how long any UK recovery could be sustained. For much of this period, the pound languished as the ERM's weakest member. Can sterling's recent strength be sustained? Much depends on further progress in containing inflation. There are indications that inflationary pressures - which have lain dormant for much of the past 18 months because of the demand-limiting effects of the recession - may start to reappear over the next few months. That could weaken the demand of overseas investors for sterling and depress its value. Another question mark is over the pace of UK recovery. Assuming that the revival proceeds at a relatively sedate pace sterling's strength can be expected to hold. But if indications emerge that the economy is being thrown off bal-ance - such as through a surge in imports that would show up in a deteriorating trade position - then the pound could suffer. A third factor concerns the decision on whether to put sterling into the narrow, 2.25 per cent band of the ERM. The pound is only one of three currencies in the 10-currency system which are allowed to fluctuate against all the others in broad, 6 per cent bands. There has been speculation that the UK will enter the narrow band at its existing central DM2.95 rate over the next six months - a decision which would probably increase the attraction of sterling to international investors. A fourth issue is the direction of German interest rates. It is possible that the Bundesbank could decide to push up German borrowing costs in a further effort to dampen inflationary forces sparked by the surge in demand in the formerly communist eastern part. Even allowing for the reappraisal in many market practitioners' minds about the D-Mark's role in the ERM, such a move by the Bundesbank would almost certainly lead to a large switching of funds into the German currency, putting pressure on sterling. Finally, no one knows to what degree the role of the D-Mark in the ERM will change in a permanent way. There have been some suggestions that the D-Marks' central position in the mechanism could be taken over at some point by the French franc, on account of France's good inflation performance over the past year. To many economists such theories seem fanciful. Until the Bundesbank is replaced as Europe's most hardline central bank on inflation, then it appears Germany's role will remain dominant. On this thinking, it could well be that the UK has to get used to a more fluid pattern of interest-rate changes as part of membership of the system. Thus, even though Britain took the opportunity to cut rates in early May, if the Bundesbank were to tighten policy over the next few months the UK might have to raise them again to prevent sterling falling beneath its ERM floor. Such a move would underline the degree to which ERM entry has pushed responsibility over UK monetary policy away from London and towards the members of the Bundesbank council sitting in Frankfurt.</p>

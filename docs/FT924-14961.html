			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Astonishment at lira's moves TENSIONS both inside and outside the European exchange rate mechanism eased yesterday, as sterling regained ground against the D-Mark and the Italian lira staged an extraordinary recovery, writes James Blitz. After Monday's huge falls in the value of most currencies against the D-Mark, there was some selling of the German currency yesterday. Some dealers suggested that the buying of D-Marks on Monday may have been overdone, while others said that yesterday's rebound reflected short term profit-taking by speculators. The Federal Open Markets Committee meeting produced no cut in the Federal Reserve's discount rate on the first day of its two-day meeting, suggesting that the all-important differential between US and German interest rates is not about to widen. The Bundesbank also highlighted the one accommodating part of its monetary policy, by again adding liquidity to the German money market at a fixed rate of 8.9 per cent, 60 basis points below the Lombard rate. Although there is no sign of a cut in official rates, Eurodeutschmark futures continued to price in another cut in German rates before the end of the year. These factors combined to push the dollar up to a high of DM1.4320 yesterday after the US currency had come close to its historic low of DM1.3860 on Monday. It later closed in London at DM1.4300, up more than 2 pfennigs on the day. Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Banking Corporation in London, has been bearish about the dollar in recent weeks and confessed himself surprised by the market's optimism. He expects the dollar to trade in a range of DM1.40 to DM1.45 in the coming weeks. In Europe, the D-Mark's weakness produced gyrations in the Italian lira of a kind that have rarely been seen in a European currency. The lira closed in London on Monday night at L934.4 to the D-Mark, 5 per cent down on the day. Yesterday, it slumped another 6 per cent, bottoming out at L985. But in the European afternoon, it regained nearly 8 per cent in value to peak at L910. As Mr O'Neill put it: 'In one day the lira has moved over twice the ground that would have separated its upper and lower limits in the ERM.' The recovery was attributed to short covering, and there was no intervention from the Bank of Italy. It closed at L916.2 against the D-Mark. Sterling recovered on a less dramatic scale, though its rebound was sufficient to renew suggestions that the UK chancellor may cut base rates this week. Sterling reached a high of DM2.4548 at the start of European trading yesterday, although that peak was never regained in the rest of the day. The pound closed at DM2.4475, up 5 1/2 pfennigs on the day.</p>

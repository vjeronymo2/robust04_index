Since then it has hardly reappeared, to the point that  many people probably believed it had been buried. But this was  not the case.    In fact, the project has reached the stage of active  preparation among Defense Ministry advisors. Leo Delcroix will  present the cabinet with a document on the subject next month.  Most of the material was ready last December, but the social  situation, more than tense at the time, was hardly propitious  for the project's advancement.  <H5>  Supply and Demand </H5>   What is in the document? There is no doubt that any  obligatory and/or unpaid formula will be avoided. The  possibility of civic, social or cultural service will be  addressed to volunteers and will include payment at least  comparable to that given to conscripts, but there will be no  wages (with their share of social payments, pension payments,  etc.).    Although Delcroix has been made responsible by his  colleagues  for clearing the terrain, the formula is not linked specifically  to the Defense Ministry. The Army will be only one of the  sectors open to those entering the scheme. In the Army scheme,  they will be able to follow in-depth training in an active unit  and then can be added to the reserves. In addition, there will  be a considerable range of social or cultural positions which  could be filled. "The question is to create a demand which  meets the supply of young people who want to put their ideals at  the disposal of society," they say at the Defense Ministry.  <H5>  Reserves </H5>   A scheme of this sort, for which no budget has been fixed,  nevertheless raises reservations in some circles. Besides the  fact that no real equivalent exists abroad, Delcroix will  obviously have work to do in convincing sceptics that he is not  seeking to form a new low social category or a way of getting  unemployed people to work.    On Tuesday [18 January], when questioned by Ecolo  [French-speaking Green Party] MP Philippe Dallons in Parliament,  the minister stated that the service would last for a short  period, its start-up would not be linked to the problem of  employment and the objective would be to counter social problems  which presently have no ideal solution.    Evidently, joint action with the language communities and  regions will be necessary, but the framework will be set at the  federal level. Insofar as there is agreement with its aim.</p>

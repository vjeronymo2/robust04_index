			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (4): Quick-fix solutions not on offer - Tony Hawkins assesses the steps taken to translate the economic dream into reality AT NO time in the past 20 years, and possibly since independence, has Nigeria had an administration so committed to economic reform. But commitment alone will not be enough to translate the Abuja Economic Summit dream into reality. Within weeks of their taking office, it was apparent that the admirable Mr Ernest Shonekan and his transitional team lacked the resources, the authority at the end of the day - the military are still calling the shots - and, above all, the time to do more than outline a platform for future reform and economic growth. The challenge is to establish a sufficiently secure economic policy framework that will survive the return to full-blooded civilian rule. In just five months, the transitional council has to tackle the twin tasks of short-term crisis management - stabilising the naira, slowing inflation, bringing a semblance of order and discipline to Nigeria's public finances - and creating a medium-term policy framework, an enabling environment within which sustained growth can be achieved. It is a formidable task, and, almost certainly, an impossible dream given the time constraint and the enormity of the inherited economic crisis. On taking office, Mr Shonekan inherited foreign reserves of under Dollars 1.4bn (less than eight weeks' import cover); a record N44.2bn budget deficit, escalating foreign debt arrears of more than Dollars 3bn, 46 per cent inflation and an unsustainable exchange rate. On the positive side, however, the military also left behind the outline of a coherent medium-term economic strategy which the Shonekan team hopes to translate into some kind of formal (a policy framework paper endorsed by the World Bank and IMF) or informal agreement ( a 'shadow' IMF programme) before it is forced to leave office. A Bank/Fund team is visiting Abuja this month to discuss such a programme, but the substantive Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) programme that Nigeria must have, if it is to get off the external debt hook, cannot be negotiated with what the international community sees as a lame-duck transitional government. At this juncture, there is just no way of assessing the likely economic policies of a civilian president, since the economy figures only at the periphery of the political debate. The omens are disturbing, however. In recent weeks, one frontrunner, Chief Abiola, has pledged to limit debt service payments to 8 per cent of exports, a second, Ambassador Kingibe, has come out against removing the petroleum subsidy while a third, Dr Joe Nwodo, has promised to double Nigeria's exports in the next four years by exploiting 15 solid minerals and to fix the naira exchange rate. In Nigeria, the economic policy debate is conducted at two very different levels. The contrast between the largely hard-headed realism of private sector participants at the Abuja summit and the popular debate in the media between presidential aspirants, assorted 'renowned' academic economists, lawyers and journalists, could hardly be greater. For the populists, the pillars of a coherent medium-term strategy include a 'realistic' administered exchange rate as distinct from one determined by market forces, antagonism towards foreign capital and foreign equity investment, the conviction that because Nigeria is an oil exporter its citizens deserve the cheapest fuel in the world, and the, sadly justified historically, belief that any Nigerian government will squander whatever resources it obtains from taxation and foreign borrowing. From an economic viewpoint, the optimal outcome would be an extended tenure for Chief Shonekan and his 'businessman's government'. They understand what has to be done, though some members of the administration still hanker after quick-fix solutions that simply are not on offer. A stiff dose of deflation, fiscal and monetary, lasting at least a year will have to be imposed. Unquestionably the key challenge is that of budgetary reform, since the roots of economic crisis - rampant inflation, a depreciating exchange rate, unstable money markets, unproductive public investment and the crowding out of private sector investment - lie in a fiscal deficit averaging 7.7 per cent of GDP since the structural adjustment programme was launched seven years ago. The phased removal of the petroleum subsidy, the closer monitoring of public spending and the planned introduction in midyear of a modified VAT will all help to curb the deficit, but the structural deficit problem will be resolved only when Nigeria has secured a debt reduction agreement with its Paris Club creditors. Last year full debt servicing would have absorbed 133 per cent of federal revenue and only when this is reduced to manageable proportions will Nigeria escape from the crisis of a yawning budget deficit and escalating payments arrears, at home and abroad. Only when the core problem of the fiscal deficit is tackled and an ESAF loan and Paris Club debt reduction agreement is in place, will a return to macro-economic stability become possible. Last year, 46 per cent inflation was fuelled primarily by the naira devaluation on the one hand and the explosion in government borrowing from the banks, especially the central bank, on the other. The money supply (M2) increased 57 per cent, largely reflecting the 96 per cent growth rate of lending to government. The Shonekan administration, which had no hand in these fiscal and monetary excesses, is now picking up the tab. According to businessmen, inflation has accelerated to between 65 per cent and 70 per cent, while the downward pressure on the naira, driven by excessive liquidity in the banking system, has widened the parallel market premium from 5 per cent for much of 1992 to 40 per cent. With a foreign exchange budget of Dollars 4.7bn for the year and dollar demand running at an annual rate of Dollars 14bn, monetary policy will have to be tightened and interest rates pushed even higher than the current 45 per cent to 50 per cent borrowing rate to slow inflation and curb domestic demand. Inflation is going to get a good deal worse before it gets better. Some packaging firms have doubled their prices in the first quarter of the year; resumed naira depreciation and the phasing out of the petrol subsidy will push inflation above 100 per cent in the third quarter, if not sooner, and even the optimists expect the naira to average N30 to the dollar this year compared with N16 in 1992. Given this inheritance there is little the transitional council can do but tighten the fiscal and monetary taps, and sweat it out while turning a deaf ear to the cries of pain from all sectors of the economy. After growing very rapidly - 8.5 per cent a year between 1988 and 1990 - GDP growth slowed to 4 per cent in 1991/2 - and will turn negative this year with the OPEC cut in oil production, falling investment as high nominal interest rates and credit restraint start to bite and as import growth is reined in and public spending declines substantially in real terms. The balance of payments deteriorated from rough balance on current account in 1991 to a deficit of some Dollars 500m last year, but with the outflow on capital account of some Dollars 3.4bn to buy back London Club debt, there was a huge Dollars 5.7bn deficit on capital account. The overall deficit of Dollars 6.2bn was financed partly by accumulating Dollars 2.6bn in arrears and running down the reserves to Dollars 1.35bn from almost Dollars 6bn a year earlier. The current account situation has since worsened forcing the Central Bank to cut the weekly supply of dollars at the currency auction to only Dollars 60m, to clamp down on open account and bills for collection trade, freezing an estimated Dollars 1bn to Dollars 1.5bn in payments due to foreign suppliers, and to defer payments for letters of credit until 90 days after the shipment of goods to Nigeria. These ad hoc measures and the continuing accumulation of official arrears - Dollars 600m owed to the UK, Dollars 500m to France and Dollars 400m to Germany - have done nothing for the country's creditworthiness nor do they get to the roots of the problem. It is a bleak picture. Chief Shonekan is not going to turn the economy around in his few months in office, but he is far and away the best option on offer. Mr Shonekan given the time, authority and resources is the man most likely to force through the deflationary package followed by a medium-term strategy for sustained recovery.  ------------------------------------------------------------ BALANCE OF PAYMENTS (DOLLARS BN)  ------------------------------------------------------------                             1990     1991     1992  ------------------------------------------------------------ Exports                     13.9     12.1     12.0 (of which oil)             (13.5)   (11.6)   (11.5) Imports                      7.1      7.9      8.5 Trade surplus                6.8      4.2      3.5 Net services                -5.4     -5.3     -5.0 Transfers                    1.0      1.0      1.0 Current account              2.5        -     -0.5 Capital (net)               -3.1     -2.3     -5.7 Overall balance             -0.6     -2.3     -6.2 Arrears                      1.6     -0.1      2.6  ------------------------------------------------------------ Source: IMF and FT estimates  ------------------------------------------------------------</p>

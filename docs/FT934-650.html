			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Ascot sells Belhaven to management for Pounds 31.5m Ascot Holdings, the former Control Securities which finalised a debt refinancing in June, yesterday agreed disposals which will cut debt by Pounds 50m. The company's shares rose  1/4 p to 5 1/2 p. At the half year end on September 30 the property and hotel group's net debt stood at Pounds 197.5m and it had negative net worth of Pounds 18.6m. It has tied up the long-expected sale of Belhaven, Scotland's oldest independent brewery which has a 61 pub estate, to a venture capital backed management team for a total of Pounds 31.5m. The consideration compares with net asset value of Pounds 16.4m. It has also agreed the sale for Pounds 24.4m cash of Heywood Business Park, a freehold warehouse distribution estate of 1.4m sq ft eight miles north of Manchester. The sale price was just above book value of Pounds 23.8m; the annual rental income is currently Pounds 2.4m. The purchaser is Burford Holdings, the property group which has been actively investing in property this year. The Belhaven deal will cut Ascot's net debt by Pounds 25.5m, made up of Pounds 17.7m in cash, Pounds 2.8m in preference shares and Pounds 8m of free trade finance which the buyer will assume. However, Ascot will provide Pounds 3m of mezzanine debt, paying interest at 10 per cent. Ascot will purchase a 15 per cent stake in the buy-out company, Belhaven Holdings, for Pounds 15,000 and has warrants to buy a further 10 per cent stake for Pounds 10,000. Mr John Kerslake, Ascot's finance director, said he was pleased to retain an equity stake in Belhaven. 'We believe in the business but we had to sell it', he said, because of Ascot's high level of debt. Mr Stuart Ross, the managing director who led the BHL buy-out, said: 'We believe the Belhaven brand can go a lot further'. The Dunbar-based brewery, founded in 1719, produces 50,000 barrels of beer a year, including Belhaven Best and 80/- cask conditioned ales. The management is believed to have about a 50 per cent equity stake in BHL. The buy-out raised a total of Pounds 36m which includes some funds for investment in the pub estate. It was backed by CVC Capital Partners, part of Citicorp Ventures, with senior debt arranged by the Bank of Scotland. Mr Nazmu Virani, former chairman of Control Securities, first took an interest in Belhaven in 1983 and became chairman of the company in 1984. He sold his stake and resigned the chairmanship in 1986, but came back with the purchase by Control Securities of the brewery and pubs, completed early in 1988 for Pounds 18m. Mr Virani's arrest in connection with the BCCI collapse precipitated his departure from Control Securities in March 1992 and refinancing talks with the group's bankers.</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / World Trade News: TIR carnets suspended The growth of smuggling by organised crime has led the International Road Transport Union (IRU), which groups road haulier associations in Europe and elsewhere, to suspend the issue of TIR 'carnets' for cross-border consignments of tobacco and alcohol from yesterday. The IRU said insurers were now refusing to cover the cost of tax and duty payments for goods which 'disappear' en route. Under the TIR scheme, which covers about 50 countries worldwide, trucks are sealed and the TIR carnet allows them to pass with the minimum of red tape to their destination. The suspension of TIR carnets means drivers transporting alcohol and tobacco will have to complete formalities at every frontier they cross, leading to considerable delays and extra cost.</p>

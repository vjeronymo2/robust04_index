			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / IBM acts against brokerage INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer, has extended to continental Europe its battle against companies that it claims are counterfeiting vital components of its large computer systems. Yesterday it started proceedings against Phoenix International (Computers), UK-based subsidiary of Phoenix Computer Associates of the US. It alleges that Phoenix, a computer brokerage based in Surrey, sold memory cards - printed circuit boards bearing memory chips - as genuine IBM products, when they had, in fact, been reworked by a third party. The action follows similar moves in the US against Phoenix's parent and four other US companies. They are Comdisco, one of the world's largest computer leasing companies, and three engineering and broking companies  - Datanon, Allen-Myland and BSM Corporation. Neither the managing director nor the finance director of Phoenix was available for comment yesterday. The issue of 'altered memory' is contentious in the computer industry because of the large market for used IBM mainframe computers.</p>

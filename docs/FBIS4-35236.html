			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hamdan al-Hajj] </F>   [Text] Amman--Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN Special  Commission entrusted with disarming Iraq, has said that he will  submit a detailed report on Iraq's positive positions toward the  Commission's efforts. At the same time, Ekeus asserted that the  UN Security Council will discuss the situation in Iraq on 2  July. He, however, ruled out a final decision on the economic  blockade imposed on Iraq. He said there will be detailed  discussions on easing these sanctions.    In an exclusive statement to AL-DUSTUR, Ekeus described  Iraq's response to the Commission's efforts as constructive,  noting that they supported the Commission's tasks. This is  despite the fact that Iraq's response to Security Council  Resolution No. 715 was delayed for at least three years, which  postponed discussions and monitoring of the arms possessed by  Iraq. Consequently, this has perpetuated the Iraqi people's  suffering due to the failure of their leadership to respond to  the international resolutions.    Ekeus said he expected there to be a possibility for  reducing  the suffering the Iraqis are facing if precise monitoring and  follow-up systems for Iraqi arms are worked out. He pointed out  that if the Security Council member states, particularly those  with the right to veto, are convinced, matters will become  easier later. However, matters will not stop at this because  Iraq will later be asked to recognize the new Kuwaiti border,  solve some humanitarian issues, and confirm its real intention  toward regional stability and peace in general.    Ekeus noted that the Commission's task is not confined to  removing and destroying Iraqi arms but also includes verifying  that Iraq will not acquire these arms again whether by  manufacturing them, importing them, or both. He asserted that  Iraq will not be simply left alone after it fully implements and  totally responds to the Security Council resolutions. There  will be continuous and long-term monitoring of Iraqi arms  lasting seven or more years to prevent Iraq from manufacturing  arms or approaching such things again. He indicated that Iraq  is one of the richest countries in the world. Who knows what  Iraq will do after lifting the embargo and ending the suffering  it is passing through? Iraq may need a few months to recover,  so monitoring must continue, he said.    Ekeus stressed that Iraq should resort to peace, stability,  and building of its state on bases far from armament in order to  remove the fears and doubts of its neighbors in the entire  region.    Before departing Amman yesterday evening, Ekeus said the  Iraqi Government has actually begun to comply with the Security  Council resolutions pertaining to the economic sanctions on  Iraq, and that he is optimistic about ending the blockade  imposed on Iraq in the near future. In a statement to  AL-DUSTUR, he added that his talks with 'Amir Rashid, head of  the Iraqi Military Industrialization Organization, were fruitful  and that he sensed Iraq's real desire for commitment and for  ending the sanctions imposed on it.    Ekeus also met with [Iraq's UN representative] Nizar Hamdun.  They discussed Iraqi arms, inspection issues, and the extent of  their conformity with the Security Council resolutions. Ekeus  said that this is the first time he has met with Iraqi officials  in Amman.</p>

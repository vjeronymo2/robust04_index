			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DARNELL LEFT WAITING FOR WORD, AND THE AX;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: SPURRIER IS REPLACED AT DUKE BUT HAS NOT ANNOUNCED WHETHER HE WILL  ACCEPT COACHING JOB AT FLORIDA.  </P> <P> Gary Darnell said his postgame speech to players Saturday was the toughest  since he took over as Florida's coach in October.  </P> <P> Just minutes after Florida's 34-7 loss to Washington in the Freedom Bowl game  at Anaheim Stadium, Gator players were still wondering who would be coaching  them next season.  </P> <P> Darnell didn't know. He was full of questions, but had few answers, about his  future.  </P> <P> "I told them I couldn't tell them anything," Darnell said. "I was apologetic in  some regards."  </P> <P> It seems clear, however, that Darnell won't be back, at least as head coach.  </P> <P> Bill Arnsparger, Florida's athletic director, has confirmed that Steve  Spurrier, who led Duke to an 8-4 record this season, has the job if he wants  it. But Spurrier, who has already been replaced at Duke, has made no  announcement about his plans.  </P> <P> Barry Wilson, one of Spurrier's assistants, was named the Blue Devils' coach  Saturday by Duke Athletic Director Tom Butters.  </P> <P> "I was disappointed that I didn't know," Darnell said. "I felt like all the  hocus-pocus was over.  </P> <P> "This team will disband and have to learn things a different way, and I'm not  too happy about that."  </P> <P> Darnell has coached the Gators to a 3-4 record since taking over for Galen Hall  five games into the season. He was the defensive coordinator under Hall for two  years and had been an assistant at Wake Forest, North Carolina and Kansas  State.  </P> <P> Hall was forced to resign Oct. 8 after admitting to NCAA rules violations for  paying $22,000 in salary supplements to two former assistants.  </P> <P> Then, on Oct. 16, the university suspended starting quarterback Kyle Morris,  reserve quarterback Shane Matthews and two walk-on players for gambling on pro  and college games.  </P> <P> Darnell said the suspensions and coaching change haven't been a distraction for  his players.  </P> <P> "And you think it would be," he said. "I told the fellas 'I'm just like you.' I  want the same thing, to have a good football team and maintain the educational  process."  </P> <P> Linebacker Pat Moorer said the players were wondering all week about the team's  future.  </P> <P> "Coach Darnell talked to us about all we were reading in the press," Moorer  said. "He said he didn't know what was going to happen after this week but that  we should concentrate on the game."  </P> <P> Florida had problems doing that. Semester exams and travel took its toll on his  players, Darnell said.  </P> <P> "It was hurry, hurry, hurry and we never got focused in on the game," he said.  "We were really loose before the game and that's not our normal mentality.  </P> <P> "I felt too many eyes starting to wander. The game was slipping back as far as  significance."  </P> <P> Freshman quarterback Donald Douglas, who scored Florida's only touchdown on a  67-yard run in the first quarter, said blaming the loss on the distractions  wasn't fair.  </P> <P> "We came into this game prepared to win and our coaches did a good job," he  said. "We just lost."  </P> <P> Darnell also drew a vote of confidence from tailback Emmitt Smith, who has yet  to announce his plans.  </P> <P> "Our coaches did their job and prepared us as best they could," said Smith, who  is considering skipping his senior year at Florida to apply for the NFL draft.  </P> <P> Darnell said he and his assistants are prepared to handle the news about their  future -- good or bad.  </P> <P> When asked if he would stay at Florida as an assistant coach, Darnell said: "I  don't think that's my call. That's another man's call."  </P></p>

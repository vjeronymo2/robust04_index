			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The new parliamentary group leader of  the right-of-center governing party, the Hungarian Democratic  Forum (MDF), has signaled his party's willingness to join a  coalition with the opposition Federation of Young Democrats  (FIDESZ), a liberal party that currently has few seats in  parliament but has a chance, according to recent polls, of  winning the spring elections. He also indicated that the media  misrepresent the new prime minister when they portray him as an  uncompromising representative of the political right.    While Ferenc Kulin, in a 13 January interview in the  Budapest  weekly BESZELO, refused to speculate about postelection  coalition possibilities, he stressed that the MDF would like to  be able to cooperate with the liberal parties against the  Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), a successor of the former  ruling communist Hungarian Socialist Workers Party (MSZMP).  Desire for such cooperation is a legacy, Kulin indicated, of  recently deceased Prime Minister Jozsef Antall, who "considered  it the most important result of the system change, which must  not be given up and must not be lost, that the country can  exclude the successor of the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party  when choosing its leading politicians and governing parties."  FIDESZ, however, is the only liberal party that seems suitable  for cooperation with the MDF, according to Kulin. The  long-standing conflict between the liberal Alliance of Free  Democrats (SZDSZ) and the MDF, he indicated, has in fact gotten  worse now that "the SZDSZ creates the impression that it is  ready to work together with the MSZP. In effect, this  simplifies our problem, because our two adversaries are merging  into one. Having said this, I have also answered the question  of whether I see a difference between the two liberal parties  [FIDESZ and SZDSZ]. Of course I see a difference, and the  difference I see is that Fidesz is not preparing to cooperate  with the successor of the MSZMP. In our system of values, this  is a basic difference," Kulin said.    Kulin also commented about his relationship with Prime  Minister Boross, asserting that there are no unbridgeable  differences between his own "national liberal" stance and  Boross's more conservative views. Charging that the media  misrepresent Boross, Kulin said that the Boross who is portrayed  by the press as standing on the right and even "extreme right,"  and who is "allegedly... on close terms with Istvan  Csurka"--Hungary's leading right-wing extremist, who broke with  the MDF last year--is "not the Peter Boross that I know." In  Boross's "whole mentality there are many elements that differ  from the things that I represent. However, it never occurred to  me for one minute that Peter Boross, the man who thinks and acts  with political responsibility, would present me with the kinds  of dilemmas that Istvan Csurka presented me with.... I do not  feel any tension between him and me that we would not be able to  clarify and resolve through a direct dialogue or an exchange of  views within our party."</p>

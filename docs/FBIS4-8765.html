			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mustafa Kurotovic from Gorazde] </F>   [Text] The chetniks have launched an even fiercer offensive  on this town. The chetniks showered Gorazde with hundreds of  artillery projectiles this morning. The war hospital in the city  center is also being targeted. Here is the latest report from  Gorazde:    [Kurtovic] According to the information of the East Bosnian  Operations Group of the Army of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the information organs of the Gorazde  Security Center, the chetniks have launched a fierce offensive  aimed at taking Gorazde as a whole. The cries of the tens of  thousands of people moving in the central part of the town, who  wait for shells and snipers and who give their lives for the  sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina, are in vain. Between 0800  and 1100 alone, thousands of shells landed on the war hospital,  civilian houses, Luke, Bare, [words indistinct]. In these  suburbs, the situation is such that it is impossible to transfer  the wounded (?to) the war hospital. The dead in this town are  no longer counted by anyone because Gorazde has been left to its  own defenders, its heroes. Gorazde will endure before the eyes  of all international institutions. To the Security Council --  you should be ashamed of yourself for the thousands of  causalities in this town. What is the purpose of your existence  as the largest international organization in saving victims.    Gentlemen, all appeals from this town have been in vain.  Only our correspondents are still reporting, warning you again  about the extremely critical and dramatic situation in Gorazde.  Gentlemen, help the residents of Gorazde, which is floating in  blood, which is being drawn in the pain of the hundreds of  wounded and killed. Help this town while there are still live  people in it.    This is Mustafa Kurtovic reporting for Bosnia-Herzegovina  Radio and Television from the Press Center of the Gorazde  District.</p>

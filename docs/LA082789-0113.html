			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A CAPITOL KIND OF RIVALRY;  </P> <P> HOUSE AND SENATE BY ROSS K. BAKER (W.W. NORTON: $19.95; 210 PP.; 0-393-02706-6)  </P> <P> "House and Senate" is the closest thing to a readable political science text  that you will find these days. As a narrowly drawn study of whether the two  houses of the United States Congress are different or similar, it is typical in  theme of a genre replete with narrowly drawn studies. Ross K. Baker finds that  the House of Representatives and Senate are sometimes similar but mostly  different, a conclusion so self-evident to the average reader of the  Constitution and the daily newspapers that one must ask why getting there took  him 210 pages. But he spices it up with enough insights, asides, and quips that  political science undergraduates, destined to be his principal audience, will  find it a revelation. Compared to the rest of the literature, it is positively  Byronic.  </P> <P> If to make these general criticisms of political science is to question the  whole field's raison d'etre, then, as an undergraduate victim of the abysmal  science, J'accuse. Many a student has plowed through complicated texts or  journal articles only to discover finally what is axiomatic to old pros like  John Sasso and Lyn Nofziger: "Most elections hinge on the state of the  economy," or "Incumbents will eat their young to be re-elected." Even from the  likes of Prof. Baker you can get a windy belaboring of the obvious in some  passages, along with chapter titles that sound like rhymes from old Motown  songs ("Convergence, Divergence, and Persistence").  </P> <P> Most political practitioners, proud of learning by doing, are as contemptuous  of political scientists as composers are of music critics. On the other hand,  if we were all instinctual geniuses, we wouldn't need our outstanding system of  colleges and universities. And even if a veteran surgeon can point at an artery  and say: "Just cut that one, piece of cake," baby docs must still log some book  time before slicing and dicing. So too, I suppose, must tomorrow's political  science teachers.  </P> <P> Still, expect to have your suspicions confirmed rather than your horizons  expanded by "House and Senate." Twenty pages in, Baker quotes Champ Clark,  speaker of the House from 1911 to 1919, as saying congressmen liked to become  senators for these reasons: "First, the longer term; second, their votes are  more important; third, patronage; fourth, participation in treaty-making;  fifth, greater social recognition." And that, it turns out, is just about it  even nowadays. We also learn that most reporters and editors prefer to cover  senators; that senators generally must be lobbied one-on-one rather than in  groups; that senators, being fewer, serve on more committees so still tend to  specialize less than representatives. And we learn that the late Sen. Frank  Church of Idaho was so contemptuous of the lower house that en route home each  evening he went out of his way to avoid driving past the House office  buildings, which when you think about it was carrying a thing a bit too far.  </P> <P> The non-specialist should not and would not turn to "House and Senate." It is  not a survey book on the Congress but a study of Baker's thesis that the  difference built into the two houses by the Framers have managed to endure in  spite of television and various other modern evils. In a brisk concluding  chapter he shows, through an analysis of the 1986 and 1988 drug bills, how the  House will respond quickly to the demands of the rabble while the Senate puffs  its pipe and takes the ostensibly more responsible long view -- "long" as in  roughly six election-free years.  </P> <P> If the solons of the upper house indeed envision themselves as more  statesmanlike than their House colleagues, an unnamed lobbyist tells Baker the  real reason why: "More often than not (senators) don't know what the hell  you're talking about. Yeah, you need to talk in concepts -- what's good for  America -- but I don't think that's because they have any deeper feelings for  America than the guys in the House. I think it's just because they don't know  the details as well. You can't talk to them any other way." The extensive  interviews that Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers, conducted  with members, reporters, and lobbyists give "House and Senate" far more of  these real-world touches than most comparable tomes.  </P> <P> There is still too much jargon about "electoral environments," "the ecology of  the House and Senate," and "the attentive elites." Baker also has the scholar's  irritating proclivity for dropping a quotation from another writer into his  text without attribution, leaving the reader to scurry to consult the footnote  to learn who's talking. But then, every few pages, he takes a deep breath and  produces some inspired writing. "The House leader," he writes, "ministers to a  flock; the Senate leader more nearly resembles the chaplain in a medieval court  whose ministrations were highly personalized and phrased with the delicacy and  diplomacy that acknowledged the power and vanity of his communications." That  kind of prose could get a man drummed out of the American Political Science  Assn. if he is not careful. "Let's have less poetry next time, Baker," they  will say, "and more charts and graphs."  </P> <P> Again, this book is about the dynamics of bicameralism, not "Congress Today."  But to appeal to a broader audience, which Baker and his publisher clearly  hoped to do, I would have taken on some currently hot congressional issues. We  learn that House members are more closely attuned to the wishes of their  districts than senators are to those of their states, but we don't learn  whether Baker believes it is entirely fitting that House members have managed  to parlay their big staffs, gerrymandered districts, and extensive  prerequisites into almost guaranteed reelection. Something on the growing  influence of political action committees and their campaign contributions would  have been germane.  </P> <P> And, yes, what about ethics, both financial and political? In an interview with  Baker, former Sen. John Culver of Iowa argued that senators are more  accommodating of one another's political needs than House members. "There's the  feeling that if I get it through the Senate and write my press release," Culver  said, "I'll drop it in (the) conference (between the House and Senate) because  I've done my thing politically." The man was saying that a senator would gladly  take the credit for some measure without ever intending to make the effort to  enact it. The remark's blithe hypocrisy is unremarked upon by the author, but  the reader catches a glimpse of the Congress he has come to know so well -- a  place where the real political science is the perfection of the fine art of  protecting every member's self-interest no matter what.  </P></p>

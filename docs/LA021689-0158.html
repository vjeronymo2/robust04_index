			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC TO PLAY HOST TO UC IRVINE TONIGHT  </P> <P> UC Irvine, which has won three of its last four games, will face the University  of the Pacific, which has a nine-game losing streak, at 7:30 tonight in a Big  West Conference basketball game in the Spanos Center.  </P> <P> Pacific has won only once in 11 Big West games and has a 5-16 overall record.  Irvine (9-12, 6-6) beat the Tigers, 90-88, Jan. 21 when center Mike Doktorczyk  made all 12 shots from the floor and scored 28 points. Doktorczyk is hampered  by a severe thigh bruise, but probably will play tonight.  </P> <P> The Anteaters' new inside threat, Ricky Butler, scored 20 or more for three  consecutive games before being triple-teamed by Cal State Fullerton Saturday  night. He was held to 13 points as Irvine lost, 78-75. JOHN WEYLER  </P></p>

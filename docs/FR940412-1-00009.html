			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Headquarters Air Force Office of Medical Support, Department of the Air Force, opposed the rule language proposed by the petitioner, as written, although it agreed with the petitioner's intent to ensure that the safety and effectiveness of devices not be compromised because original parts are replaced by inferior ones. They did not agree that all replacement parts should be subject to the requirements of 10 CFR part 32. They stated that NRC review and approval should apply to replacements of parts or components that are essential to the proper and safe operations of a device. The Air Force gave examples of parts (such as panel screws and covers) that conform to industry standards. These, the Air Force stated, should not be subject to the proposed requirements. The Air Force voiced concern that the petition, as written, may serve to restrict competition and would lead to greater expense which would have to be recouped through higher medical costs from patients, or, in the case of the Air Force, from taxpayers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> NRC Action on the Petition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC reviewed the petition, the public comments, and the two cases (incidents) cited by the petitioner as supporting evidence for filing this petition. The NRC also reviewed its regulations pertinent to the petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Shortly after the NRC received correspondence <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  from AMS about the two cases, the NRC advised <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  AMS of its intention to investigate these incidents, especially with regard to the quality of service and replacement parts used in servicing the teletherapy units. From October to December 1989, the NRC conducted a thorough investigation which included three onsite inspections: Atom Mechanical Company, Cleveland, Ohio (The servicing company that conducted the maintenance and replacement of parts in the two cases), St. Mary's Medical Center, Saginaw, Michigan, and Picker International, Highland Heights, Ohio (The company that manufactured the teletherapy units at Anderson Memorial Hospital and at St. Mary's Medical Center). The NRC also referred the case of Anderson Memorial to the State of Maryland, because the company that serviced the teletherapy unit there, Atom Mechanical Company, is an authorized user on the Neutron Products, Inc. license, and Neutron Products is located in the State of Maryland, an Agreement State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Three letters dated June 20, August 8, and August 25, 1989, to Hugh L. Thompson, Jr., Deputy Executive for Nuclear Materials Safety and Safeguards &amp; Operations Support, NRC, from Sherry Stein, Director, Regulatory Affairs, Advanced Medical Systems, Inc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> By a letter dated September 15, 1989 from Robert M. Bernero, Director, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, NRC, to Sherry Stein, Director, Regulatory Affairs, Advanced Medical Systems, Inc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incident at Anderson Memorial Hospital was caused by a broken spring in a teletherapy unit which failed to retract the source into the OFF position following a cobalt-60 cancer treatment. The hospital technologist promptly retracted the source manually. According to the hospital report, the technologist received very little additional exposure over expected monthly exposure, as evidenced by the individual's radiation film badge reading. Moreover, according to the same report the delivered daily dose to the patient was less than the prescribed daily dose, i.e., no patient overexposure for that treatment, because the technologist acted promptly. In its communication with NRC (prior to filing the petition), AMS stated that it was concerned about the quality of the replacement springs used in the teletherapy machine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The incident at St. Mary's Medical Center was caused by the failure of a microswitch. The failure of the switch prevented a timing device from operating properly, to automatically terminate the treatment. No misadministration occurred because the subsequent treatment times were adjusted and the total delivered dose did not differ from the total prescribed dose. Neutron Products, Inc. was called to repair the machine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

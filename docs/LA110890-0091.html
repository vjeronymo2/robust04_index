			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CORNER BAR: COLD BEER, CHEAP FOOD, LEVEL POOL TABLES -- AND NO PRETENSE  </P> <P> Sick of taking heat from East Coasters about how every saloon in Southern  California is some effete nouveau fern bar tarted up to look like it might have  a pedigree stretching back to ancient times but that still reeks of eau de yup?  Take them to Joe Jost's and shut them up forever.  </P> <P> Joe Jost's is the oldest saloon in Long Beach, and it is where hunger, thirst  and pretense go to die. The beer comes in frosted 20-ounce schooners, the eggs  are pickled on the premises, and the Joe's Special (polish sausage on rye) is a  true classic. There is pool and snooker in the back room, and freshly roasted  peanuts and cigars are sold behind the bar.  </P> <P> The wooden rail under the aluminum bar has been worn smooth by men who took  their sons in for their first public drinks and by the sons who in turn came  with their own sons. The booths and tables are dark and wooden and bear carved  initials that have been varnished over again and again. The ceiling fans are  old and made for function, not show. The walls are cluttered with old photos,  foreign bank notes and snapshots of patrons in Joe Jost's T-shirts standing  before the Alamo, the Eiffel Tower and the Great Wall of China.  </P> <P> The place started out as a barber shop in the early 1920s, and Joe, a Hungarian  immigrant, served root beer and sandwiches to waiting customers during  Prohibition. After Prohibition was repealed, the local health department told  Joe that he could either serve food and beer or cut hair, but not both. Out  went the barber chairs and up went a bar.  </P> <P> Today the place is run by Ken Buck, Joe's grandson. It's not a historical  landmark, but it ought to be.  </P> <P> Joe Jost's is no longer male-dominated. In fact, it has become something  patrons call a family bar. On weekends in particular, men and women arrive with  their kids and share tables with regulars and victorious softball teams.  </P> <P> Sports on TV, good talk, cheap food, cold beer, level pool tables and nearly  seven decades of experience and unaltered tradition. Mention "urban renewal,"  and hundreds of loyal patrons would cheerfully throw themselves in front of the  bulldozers.  </P> <P>  Joe Jost's, 2803 E. Anaheim St., Long Beach. Open 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. Monday  through Saturday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday. (213) 439-5446. PATRICK MOTT  </P></p>

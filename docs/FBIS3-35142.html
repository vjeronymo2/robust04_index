The conference should include the countries directly concerned  with this problem and other concerned countries that want to  participate in it so as to define the future strategy of Arab  water security within the framework of Pan-Arab security. In a  lecture he delivered yesterday evening at the Egyptian  University of International Law in Cairo, he said that  international developments, major economic challenges, and giant  cartels that have begun to form in the world require the Arab  countries to take action quickly and to enhance their solidarity  and cooperation to be able to deal with these challenges and  blocs strongly and effectively.</p>

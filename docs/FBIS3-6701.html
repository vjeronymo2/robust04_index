			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 19 KYODO -- The head of the Democratic  Socialist Party (DSP), one of the seven parties in the ruling  coalition, voiced reluctance Saturday [19 March] to a proposed  establishment of a joint parliamentary group among the seven.    DSP leader Keigo Ouchi, speaking to reporters at a news  conference in the central Japan city of Tsu near Nagoya, said  the proposal "needs careful study." He said, "The foundation of  the Hosokawa cabinet may see a major crack if it is pushed ahead  in a hasty manner."    Ouchi, who is the health and welfare minister in the cabinet  of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, said, "Nothing has been  decided as far as the DSP is concerned."    Ouchi's remark differs from the party's No. 2 man, Takashi  Yonezawa, who met Thursday with coalition strategist Ichiro  Ozawa, secretary general of the key coalition party Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party] and agreed to promote efforts toward the  establishment of a new party in preparation for a next general  election for the House of Representatives.    Under the political reform package enacted in late January,  the next general election is almost certain to pick 300 lower  house members in single-seat constituencies plus 200 seats  chosen through proportional representation. There are  differences of opinion among the seven parties on how to cope  with the single-seat districts in rivalry to the main opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).    Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP) and Shinseito (Japan  Renewal  Party) headed by Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata have pushed ahead  with a plan to unite the seven coalition parties as part of  efforts to prepare for the next general election.    However, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the biggest  group  in the coalition, and new party Sakigake [Harbinger] led by  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura have indicated  opposition to the idea.    Earlier this month, Hosokawa said the coalition would be at  a  disadvantage in the next general election unless it overcame  internal rivalry and agreed to file a joint candidate in each of  the single-seat constituencies.    It is not known when the next general election will be  called. The four-year term of the incumbent lower house is to  last through July 1997. But many politicians say there will be  a snap general election before that time because of the major  change in the election system under the political reform package.</p>

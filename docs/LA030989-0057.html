			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> In a study with far-reaching implications for the routine treatment of heart  attack patients, researchers have found that the immediate use of special  balloons to force open clogged arteries is unnecessary in the vast majority of  cases if the patient is treated with a clot-dissolving drug. Most heart  specialists have assumed that the balloon treatment, an expensive and  increasingly popular procedure called balloon angioplasty, should routinely  follow the use of drugs, such as TPA, that dissolve the blood clots that cause  most heart attacks. But in a study of 3,262 heart-attack patients, researchers  at medical centers across the country found the extra measures were rarely  needed. The results were reported in today's issue of the New England Journal  of Medicine.  </P></p>

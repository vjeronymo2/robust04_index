Good evening, and many happy returns. Now that the House of  Representatives has begun to exercise its responsibilities; and  as your brother, who has had the honor of serving with the sons  of this country for more than 40 years, I found that I have to  meet my brothers to talk about some of our concerns and affairs.  We want to talk in a fraternal way within this family to which  we all belong out of our concern to carry out our duties in a  satisfactory way. I hope that we all seek God's satisfaction  and ask Him to guide us and grant us success.    When we prepared for this meeting in this blessed month and  on this night, we did not imagine that it would take place in  the wake of one of the ugliest crimes witnessed by the world.  This crime was perpetrated yesterday morning in the holy  Ibrahimi Mosque when a large number of our kinsfolk, brothers,  and beloved ones were martyred and others more were wounded.  Those who died on Friday morning in the Ibrahimi Mosque in this  blessed month will go to heaven with the chaste righteous  martyrs. Everyone hopes he will become a martyr for the sake of  God. Only God knows when a person will die.    We were, still are, and will continue to support our  kinsfolk  and brothers in Hebron, Jerusalem, and in every part of the  occupied Arab territory. I cannot express in words the  endurance of the kinsfolk there under occupation. They are an  example for people in terms of their patience, steadfastness,  and adherence to their land and rights. I also reiterate that  we will continue to do the impossible to have them regain all  their rights on their national soil. We have no other objective  or goal other than a clear conscience and the satisfaction of  Almighty God.    We have done all we can in the face of this tragedy in  terms of what we can offer and our available capabilities.    We sympathize with every mother and father who lost a  martyr,  with every brother who lost his brother, with every human being  in Hebron, with those injured, and with our kinsfolk.    Once again I say--and this is not the first time, though one  always hopes it is the last--that we do not have any objective  and we do not harbor ambitions other than to see the kinsfolk  masters of their land.    Faced with what has happened, we are going to do our best to  push the responsible quarters in Israel to expose their real  faces. Will they shoulder their responsibilities toward what  happened and take measures that would at least show that all  efforts made toward peace were or were not right?    The story did not begin with this massacre and heinous  crime.  Before this crime there was the burning of the al-Aqsa Mosque,  the aggression against the sacred shrines, including the  Ibrahimi Mosque, and the aggression against the Christian holy  places. You remember that we have been calling for religious  jurisdiction, and that sovereignty on all sacred places is for  Almighty God. As for the Islamic holy places, we try to gather  around us the support of all brothers in the Islamic world to  guarantee that what happened will not recur in the future. What  has taken place is enough to prove that these people do not  shoulder their responsibilities and cannot be asked to assume  responsibility for the holy places of those who believe in God.    The issue then requires that we think about a new  satisfactory situation in which the Islamic world will shoulder,  with us, its responsibilities. There were talks about  interfaith dialogue with regard to the holy places. Sovereignty  is for Almighty God. Each side will then take care of its holy  places regardless of the political situation or the possible and  impossible solutions. We will continue to call for all this and  work toward materializing this call on the ground. We hope the  time will come when believers in God will compete for  worshipping, fearing, and respecting God in the holy places.    With regard to the measures that should be taken at this  stage, we think and work, in addition to all that you were  acquainted with, to adopt a stand that will have positive  effects. Before and after everything, we think of our kinsfolk,  brothers, and beloved ones.    I heard some people saying that we should withdraw from the  negotiations and others saying that we have no right to discuss  such matters under these circumstances. (?This is) correct. I  am talking to you as a person in whom, I believe, you have  confidence, and through you I am addressing the entire Jordanian  community. I am talking to you as a person who has confidence  and who also trusts you all. I hope that all my brothers will  give us the opportunity as well as the support through  awareness, honesty, sincerity, and determination to work to  enable us to remain steadfast in the face of the continuous and  difficult pressures coming from all directions.    My wish is for us to enjoy a measure of awareness, and to  have the resolve and determination to always take manly stands,  as we did in the past, to demonstrate that we are unwilling to  bow to anybody other than Almighty God. We could face  difficulties and pressures. This has been our story from the  outset. I would like to see all psychologically prepared when  such an eventuality materializes. This is important if  everybody is to extend his share of support, and if we, along  with you, God willing, are to stand with our heads held high,  and if the outcome is to be to our liking.    In their conduct toward us, some in this world always have  in  mind the Israeli public opinion, the public opinion here or  there, as if we do not have a public opinion. We would like to  tell them that we do have a public opinion, that we have a  lively and enlightened people, and that we have the resolve and  ability to hold out, stand fast, move forward, and shoulder  responsibilities jointly and unequivocally with regard to all  issues and topics. We have the ability to control our emotions  by exercising our mental faculties. We are able to chart the  outlines of our future policies, and to walk our path in  complete unison, demonstrating joint understanding and  cooperation. We might differ on some interpretations or views.  However, when joint interests, which are of greater importance  than all issues, are at stake, we remain cohesive under all  circumstances and conditions. Nonetheless, and to be frank, I  will not hesitate to take a certain step in response to the  public opinion if such a step is found to be appropriate. I  believe that I am aware of the sentiments of the good people  from whom I emerged and to whom I belong. All that I ask of you  is for you to be with your homeland and with this march, always  and ever.    I will be frank with you, and tell you about all that needs  to be communicated outside the confines of official agencies.    Of course you, in the House of Representatives, have the  right to acquaint yourselves with everything and to participate  in drawing up the path for the present and future. The issue of  withdrawing or not withdrawing is something we decide on the  basis of our convictions, and also within the framework of  cooperation and coordination with our brothers in the Arab world.    If we continue, there will be a price and a benefit which we  hope will be for our kinsfolk and brothers in the occupied  territories in the first place. If we withdraw for  consultation, or if we withdraw for good, this should be in the  interest of our cause and our generations both at present and in  the future. But to be absorbed in details and to spread this  talk beyond the House of Representatives, I think will not serve  our interest at this stage.    As for the House and its performance so far, and the  impression I received when this House was elected--which is the  second parliament since our resumption of democratic life in  this country--and through long experience, in fact my feeling is  that through your election the citizens and voters reflected the  ambitions, hopes, and awareness they have. The citizen wants  you to work, to work more, and to give the maximum you can in a  reasonable, enlightened, and honest manner.    My hope has been, is still, and will continue to be that you  will continue and try to make up for the past. Much time passed  in terms of achievements that could have been made, in terms of  the stage and how delicate and difficult it is, in terms of laws  that need rectification and adoption, in terms of work, and in  terms of issues that need to be presented and discussed.    I urged the government, urged the House -- represented by  its speaker and the brothers when I met them -- and urged the  brothers in the Senate to maintain coordination so that matters  will be tackled efficiently and with responsibility.  Ultimately, people will judge us in light of our achievements.    As a brother, rather than from the position of a person with  responsibilities, I would like to appeal to you all to rise  above minor issues and personal conflicts. I also appeal to you  not to waste time on issues that would tarnish your image, our  image, Jordan's image, or the march.    Let us stand well with each other and let us work in the  interest of the country. Each one of us, particularly you,  should work toward laying the foundations for new parliamentary  traditions and norms so that the bases will be stronger than  before and so that the coming generations will continue to walk  on a clear path. Even practically, I do not believe that the  situation is sound. In every House session, the whole cabinet  should be present. If the cabinet spends two days with the  House and one day with the Senate, and if it holds its meetings  in two days, how many days will be left for the cabinet to  tackle the citizens' issues? I believe that if the concerned  ministers attend the House session this will be sufficient. Of  course, in important issues the entire cabinet must be there.    Through dialogue, you can discuss the situation so that you  can invest our potentials, resources, and time in a better way.  The official media are not carrying out their role. We want  our brothers to move in this regard. The media are considered  state media, but they are lost and absent in most cases. Either  the media should be a state media that advocate the state policy  or we should find another formula.    I will not specify, but there are laws that are of great  importance. Once again, when these laws are presented to you  they are presented because there is a conviction that they are  feasible and beneficial to the citizen and needy citizen, and  they are presented to organize this country and the relations of  its people, and so that its resources are not wasted or  exhausted. These laws would be beneficial for our people,  family, and march regardless of whether they were proposed by  this or that world quarter .    There are other issues that you will discuss and on which  you  will make the appropriate decision. I believe we should not be  too hasty in some fields so that we will not suffer a setback.  Do we follow the right measures when we plan for the future in  Amman or elsewhere? Do we start with the ideal thing that  should be realized one day and make sure not to make mistakes to  avoid negative results, God forbid?    I had in mind, and I proposed to my brothers that there  should be coordination, contacts, explanation, and discussion  concerning any draft law and all stages through which it passes  so that the outcome and result will be the ideal that we and  everyone of us seeks in this country. I believe that so far  this mechanism is not available in a satisfactory and  comfortable manner. I pray for Almighty God's help so that this  will be the natural situation in the future.    What is painful to me more than anything else is to use my  right and return some laws, as happened several times, out of my  concern for the homeland and the people. I do not want to  exercise this right so spare me, yourselves, the Senate, all  brothers, and the homeland this effort through cooperation  between the executive and legislative branches of power, and  through studying everything with due attention until eventually  the desired situation is reached.    I do not believe that any of us is outbidding others, or  likes to be called a person engaged in oneupmanship. The  country is ours, and what is at stake is the destiny of future  generations. Hence, God willing, each of us will be engaged day  and night in some sort of soul-searching. Each of us must do  all he can to achieve our objectives and goals.    The circumstances are tough, and the suffering is  continuing.  Pressures on us continue from all directions. However, we must  confront them with discipline, patience, resolve, and  determination. Even our reactions to what we are experiencing,  and to our past experiences must be studied and calculated to  yield a positive outcome. People can express their feelings in  lots of ways. However, we must underscore the positive aspect in  this.    A question is posed on whether a strike, for example, with  due respect to the views of brothers in this regard, would  promote, even in the least, the cause of our kinfolk and  brothers in the occupied territories, and in Hebron in  particular at present. If, God forbid, we inflame people's  sentiments and a guest of ours, regardless of where he came from  on this globe, is encroached on, would such a thing bring us  honor, given that these people are our guests? Should we  degrade ourselves, God forbid, to the level reached by the  enemies, who are behaving unreasonably and unacceptably, when  nothing escapes the attention of the world community, or should  we think of alternatives? Why should we bring life in Amman,  other cities, or villages to a standstill for a single day?  This would prevent people from selling their goods, or leading  a normal life. If we were to set aside part of that day's  earnings and donate it humbly to our brethren, would this not be  a better move?    It would be preferable, brothers, if each of us thinks day  and night of all he can do to ensure the availability of  resources that could promote the interests of both the homeland  and the march.    We have been living under difficult circumstances over the  past four years. Instead of switching on all lights, we could  switch on some of them; and instead driving too many cars, we  could share a car with a brother or friend. The objective is to  save some energy. If we save a few things here and there, we  could have something that would help us face any possibility.    One of the issues that was discussed for a long time was the  issue of medical care, food, medicine. We have been looking  into this subject over the past years. What happens in others  parts of the world could also happen here. Consequently, we  should issue instructions and attempt to unify and organize  departments to enable them deal with this situation.    It is known that some industrial countries are not concerned  about exporting goods that are below the standards used in the  industrial countries themselves. This needs our concern and  control. We are not the first, nor will we be the last country  to make mistakes. If these mistakes are detected and rectified,  and if the responsible side is the party which discovered this  situation and adopted a stand -- as happened here -- then this  is good. However, let us look at the broader picture. How many  people know that according to international reports we have no  less than 7,000 drug addicts? We remain silent on these matters  either out of shame or because we are incapable of dealing with  it. We must begin to tackle this problem correctly whether  through firm measures regarding trafficking or traffickers or  through setting up specialized centers to treat and cure addicts.    But to remain shy and silent, I believe this is a mistake  we commit against ourselves and our children--many of whom went  abroad for study and returned with these or other problems.    We are in need of industry, development, and everything.  There is a subject I have repeatedly raised with our brothers,  including the deputies from the al-Fuhays area, and they are  trying. Do you not see the billowing smoke which contains  cement dust. [reference here is to the cement factories in  al-Fuhays]    My granddaughter and all my sons from 'Abdallah to this  little Jumanah, suffer from asthma. For years, we have been  saying that someone should study this situation. There are  human beings around this site. This does not mean that I am  pushing you to decide something now, but it is time to think  about our people. May be because I am concerned and I  personally suffered, otherwise my voice would have been lower  than the others, but this is something illogical.    Our water and treatment of it, and ensuring that poisons  from  the factories do not reach the dams and contaminate the water  there. Should I or you be the one to raise these issues? Should  I or you be the one to tackle it in a calm and objective  discussion? Likewise, there are many other issues that I think  we have to handle? But to concentrate on trivial things is not  good for any of my brothers or for the homeland. Wasting  time--and it seems lately we have been wasting much time, God  help us--should stop. If you have another opinion, then we  should seek the judgment of the people. God willing, they will  be the judge of whether we are doing what we should in the best  possible manner.    Our country is good and generous. It is a rock in the face  of enemies. Our country is full of good things. What pains me  most is to see continuous attempts to harm and undermine all its  achievements.    Nobody mentions good accomplishments. However, we rummage  around for things to brand as mistakes. If what is found to be  a mistake is really significant, that would be most welcome.  Nonetheless, it seems that we are headed for frustration to  frustrate both ourselves and people. Why is this? This must  not be the case.    Let is recall the starting point, when we chose to revive  democratic and parliamentary traditions and when circumstances  made this revival possible. I would like to say that our  decision in this regard was not the outcome of popular pressure  from any party whatsoever. Rather, this revival of democratic  and parliamentary traditions was the outcome of a decision we  made and a wish we had. We want democracy to be a trust to  bequeath to our future generations so they may carry, safeguard,  and protect it. We wanted this country to be an example and  model to others.    Many people are making allegations in this regard. This must  not be the case. We should not remain silent over this. In the  past, similar allegations were made. The late Abu-'Adnan  [Bahjat] al-Talhuni [former Senate member] was with me at this  Court when the Army Command was Arabized. Then, we were  approached only after the people had realized that the  accomplishment had been made, and that those whose departure was  ordered had already left the country. However, afterward, we  heard of heroes who drew up schemes and carried out certain  feats in this regard. Abu-Shakir [Royal Court Chief al-Sharif  Zayd Bin-Shakir] is aware of this. Nobody approached us then.  There have been numerous recurrences of this.    We embrace democracy within our hearts and souls. We want it  to succeed. We want to set an example and a model of shura to  others. We want Arab individuals to live and realize that they  are of value, that they are human beings, just like other human  beings. We want this march to achieve its purposes and  objectives. We are bound to succeed. So, help us all so we may  succeed. In other words, let us all cooperate to render the  march a success.    As for the issues pertaining to inter-Arab meetings,  inter-Arab cooperation, and the demands for holding an Arab  summit, I would like to say that we have always been at the  forefront of those demanding such a summit, and we will continue  to be so.    I have never considered any difference with any brother  here or in any other place a personal matter that will leave any  trace. We might have differences of interpretation sometimes.  I never took the insults which even reached plotting to kill as  personal. Even the insults, vilifications, and digging up the  past I never took as personal. This is because a man in this  position and with such responsibilities must be above all these  things. I sincerely and honestly mean what I am saying. This  is our situation, our life, and our path. We must not continue  to speak about the Intelligence, the Security, and the Army. I  reiterate what many people have reiterated: Had it not been for  the Intelligence, the Security, and the Army we would not have  the opportunity to live such a life. The Intelligence is not  against the citizens of this country; it is to protect the  country against deep-rooted and strong organizations that have  huge potentials in the most serious positions in the Arab  homeland. We as well as the Army -- our officers and soldiers  who are protecting long fronts against dangers and challenges to  maintain the security of the country and who are deployed  throughout the world -- praise be to God, are appreciated and  respected by people. Instead of deploying foreign forces here  and there in our Arab territory, we are assuming this role to  prevent evil among people in Europe and elsewhere with a high  degree of efficiency, capability, and honesty.    Our youths are in Yemen now in an attempt to consolidate the  pillars of the accord on which all the sons of Yemen were  unanimous. We had the honor to welcome them here in Amman, Amman  of the Arabs, the capital of accord and reconciliation. Our  youths from the Armed Forces are there in Yemen to help  implement the accord and pledge document and to tackle a matter  inflicted on our kinsfolk and brothers. Our duty as Arabs is to  resolve our problems and to support each other under difficult  circumstances and in the face of challenges.    People, this homeland deserves more. May God grant us  success and guide us on the right path. I have great hope in  you. Almighty God will guide our march and grant us success.  Greetings to you all. God's peace. mercy, and blessings be  upon you.</p>

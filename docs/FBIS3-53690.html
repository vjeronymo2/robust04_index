The early-warning units will be placed in  three locations -- Elat, 'al-'Aqabah, and al-Nuwaybi' -- and  will be built with EC financing. The decision to set up the  joint system was made at a meeting held in al-Nuwaybi' in the  Sinai by the multinational committee on environment affairs  within the framework of the peace talks. The systems will be  built within one to one and a half years    (Christian Falkovsky), the EC representative who presided  over the meetings, told our correspondent Shulamit Schmerling  that he hopes Saudi Arabia will join the efforts to save the  environment at a later stage. Our correspondent points out that  it is estimated that the European financing of the system will  total $10 to $15 million.</p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Mellor to overhaul policies at new heritage department MR DAVID MELLOR is determined to launch a rigorous review of policy in every area of activity covered by his new National Heritage department. This means that everything from funding of the arts to sport, tourism and broadcasting will be given a fresh look by the potentially high-profile department created after the general election. Mr Mellor said in an interview with the Financial Times: 'I can't think of a single area where there is an existing policy that doesn't have to be taken down, inspected, scrutinised and at the very least polished up and probably frankly dismantled and put together again.' The former chief secretary to the Treasury insisted, however, that he intended to seek consensus and was already planning to bring in 'a whole host of people' for talks on future initiatives. 'I accept my responsibility to give a lead but I believe the record shows that I am someone who is capable of stimulating a debate by bringing in the best brains from the groups affected and outside,' he said. One of his main tasks, which include setting up a national lottery designed to raise Pounds 1bn a year and planning the millennium celebrations, will be renegotiation of the BBC's Charter. Mr Mellor said neither he nor Mr John Major, the prime minister, was about to take an axe to the BBC. He said he did want to stimulate the widest possible public debate about the corporation's future role and funding. Everyone, Mr Mellor said, had wanted a powerful arts ministry rather than a sideshow, yet they wanted him to be taken to the vet first and neutered before having anything to do with them. 'If groups want to be represented by a cabinet minister who enjoys the full-hearted confidence of the prime minister as a major player in his administration they have to expect that an element of dynamism has to be injected,' he said.

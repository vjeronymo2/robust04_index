He has worked at "Oboroneksport"  since 1976 and has been deputy chairman of this organization  since 1992.    Yuriy Georgiyevich Sizov completed the Military Academy  of Communications, is a specialist on air defense weapons, and  is editor of VPK magazine.    At the end of his political career, U.S President D.  Eisenhower introduced the term "MIC" -- military industrial  complex. Since that time, this term has become acclimated in  many countries. The president thought that the U.S. military  industrial complex was a monster that was increasingly  subordinating the country's political and economic life to  itself.    With the initiation of perestroyka and M.S. Gorbachev's  energetic steps that were directed at arms reduction, in our  country the term military industrial complex became an expletive  in the mouths of a number of deputies and certain irresponsible  politicians. They presented the matter in such a manner that we  only had to reduce appropriations for the needs of the military  industrial complex and, if prosperity did not come, then in any  case, great material and financial possibilities would appear in  the country to resolve various internal problems. In the  process, conversion was understood simply as the appearance of a  large quantity of consumer goods which would be manufactured by  military plants instead of weapons. For some reason they were  silent about the fact that conversion initially requires large  capital investments and only later will it provide a yield.    After the breakup of the Soviet Union, the Commission on  Military-Industrial Issues under the USSR Council of Ministers  Presidium, which coordinated the work of the country's defense  sectors, was eliminated. In the Russian Federation,  appropriations for the defense industry were drastically reduced  and total uncertainty has arisen with state orders for arms: in  1992, expenditures for the purchase of arms and military  equipment were reduced by 68% and were practically  reduced to  zero in a whole series of directions. The level of production of  certain types of arms fell so much that it became unprofitable  for enterprises which "began to refuse defense orders", said  First Deputy Minister of Defense A.A. Kokoshin (IZVESTIYA, No  23, 23 January 1993). The majority of defense enterprises were  left to their own devices.    How was that reflected in the lives of the people? Did the  people's material welfare improve as the politicians had  previously assumed? It turned out that nearly half of the  country's population was linked with the domestic military  industrial complex and the most qualified portion of the workers  worked in the defense complex. The collapse of the military  industrial complex painfully struck these people and resulted in  a drastic reduction of their standard of living. For the state,  this signified a substantial reduction of hard currency earnings  because, prior to 1991, for each ruble spent in defense  production the country received $2 in arms sales on the world  market (IZVESTIYA, No 137, 12 June 1992).    The Russian Federation is sustaining large losses from the  reduction of arms sales. There were at least two causes for the  reduction. The first is associated with the lessening of the  attention of state organs to military issues in 1990-1991. Some  politicians turned out to be uncomfortable that the country was  earning money on arms sales. Furthermore, the collapse in the  administration of the state resulted in a collapse in this  sphere. Some time passed before the government arrived at an  understanding of the importance of the international arms market  for Russia. By the middle of 1992, it became clear that the  country would be able to obtain more hard currency through arms  sales than through Western credits which our children and  grandchildren will have to pay back.    Right now in Russia the Commission for Military-Technical  Cooperation is involved with the fundamental issues of arms  sales. The six first directors of the main departments are  members of the Commission: the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs, Roskomoboronprom [Russian Committee on the  Defense Industry], the Ministry of Economics, MVES [Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations] and the Foreign Intelligence  Service. A Russian Federation Supreme Soviet special deputies  group carries out oversight functions.    The second cause of the reduction of arms sales was the  intensification of competition on the world arms market which  crowded Russia out. Our competitors skillfully took advantage of  the defeat of Iraq in the 1991 war. It was presented like this:  Iraq had primarily Soviet-made arms which turned out to be  uncompetitive with the arms of the Multi-National Forces, that  is, Western arms defeated Soviet arms. Hence it followed that  all purchasing countries need to acquire only Western arms.  Unfortunately, the idea of the backwardness of Soviet weapons  was energetically spread in our country and was used for attacks  against the Soviet Armed Forces.    What is the real state of affairs? Aircraft make up the main  part of Russian arms exports. Air defense weapons are part of  the second group, then come Ground Troops weapons (tanks, combat  infantry vehicles, and artillery). The fourth group is naval  weapons (IZVESTIYA, No 137, 12 June 1992).    Right now it has become clear that many models of Russian  aircraft do not lag behind Western aircraft but often surpass  them. The MiG-29 fighter aircraft has been recognized as the  best in its class in the world. In 1991, after a thorough  examination by experts, the Bundeswehr accepted 24 MiG-29  aircraft into the inventory that had belonged to the GDR [German  Democratic Republic] (IZVESTIYA, No 178, 27 July 1991). The  S-300V Air Defense Missile System does not have any equivalents  and, in the opinion of foreign experts, will exceed Western  complexes until the end of the century. The BMP-3 combat  infantry vehicle became the winner in comparative tests of  similar vehicles. We can cite other cases but the superiority of  our weapons is best discussed in the articles of the chief  designers of weapons that are being presented to readers of VPK  magazine.    Recently, we can note substantial changes of the views of  the  country's leadership on arms sales. The doctrine that  predominated in the USSR that we could only sell obsolete  weapons promoted the discrediting of Soviet arms. Right now,  many unnecessary procedural restrictions have been removed. The  leadership finally realized that the arms that are in the troops  should not be secret with the exception of certain technological  issues. Therefore, the latest arms must go to market and yield  the needed money, including for the development of even more  improved weapons.    However, arms sales are not only an effective source of hard  currency receipts, they are also an effective foreign policy  tool. Previously, the USSR sold many weapons at reduced prices.  This primarily pertained to countries that were Warsaw Treaty  allies. Arms were sold to a number of countries on credit and  the loans were not always repaid and no-cost transfers were  carried out to some countries. Right now arms sales to Iraq,  Kuwait, Libya, Yugoslavia and Ethiopia have been completely  terminated.    Russia is attempting to step up its involvement on the  international arms market. In 1992, the "Mosaeroshow-92"  International Exhibition, at which the latest aircraft and air  defense systems were displayed, was conducted in our country for  the first time. Approximately 200 CIS firms and 82 firms from  the far abroad displayed products. At the last moment, the  Americans refused to participate in demonstration flights in  F-15, F-16, and F-18 aircraft. For the first time, Russia  demonstrated that it is a great air power (IZVESTIYA, No 183, 13  August 1993).    In 1993, Russia made a serious attempt to conquer new arms  markets by actively participating in the "IDEX-93" Exhibition at  Abu Dhabi. More than 550 firms from 34 countries displayed  modern artillery systems and ammunition for them, close combat  weapons, PVO [air defense] complexes, armored vehicles and  aircraft, optical devices and navigation systems, various  classes of missiles, shipborne weapons, and servicemen's full  gear at this exhibition.    The Russian exposition was quite impressive: more than 370  models of modern weapons were displayed, nearly half were  displayed abroad for the first time and, many types of weapons  -- in operation. Our country had never previously displayed such  a vast arms exposition. The Russian delegation received prizes  for best firing and the largest demonstration of modern military  equipment.    From missile weapons, Russia displayed the "Tochka-U"  tactical complex which, although developed more than 10 years  ago, is distinguished by its high tactical-technical  specifications, first and foremost, for firing accuracy and  mobility. The "Msta-S" 152-mm Self-Propelled Howitzer did not  have any competitors. It is capable of firing 10 50-kg  projectiles per minute. It can destroy a point target at a  distance of 12 kilometers using the "Krasnopol" projectile with  a laser-guided seeker. The howitzer does not have any equals in  maneuverability and off-road capability. The comfort conditions  developed for its crew also merit attention (IZVESTIYA, No 65, 8  April 1993).    Tank weapons -- the T-80 tank and the BMP-3 combat infantry  vehicle -- made a big impression at the exhibition at Abu Dhabi.  The T-80 was named the "flying tank" for its high maneuvering  capabilities. The BMP-3 is distinguished not only by its high  off-road capability but by its high fire power (a 100-mm gun and  a weapons guidance system have been installed on the vehicle).  The T-80 and BMP-3 are distinguished by good habitability and  they beat American, French and German vehicles in tests on the  Arabian sands.    The Russian air defense weapons that had already been  displayed at the "Mosaeroshow-92" exhibition and at the  "Oborona-92" exercises reaffirmed their high qualities. Models  of the S-300 PMU, "Tor", "Strela-10M3", and "Igla" air defense  missile complexes and also posters and mock-ups of other types  of complexes were displayed at Abu Dhabi. The "Smerch" and  "Uragan" multiple rocket systems and the "Shturm-S" and "Metis"  antitank complexes demonstrated outstanding specifications.  These complexes and small arms confirmed their high live firing  effectiveness on the range.    Of the naval weapons, the "Piranya" submarine and the APS  5.66-mm underwater assault rifle attracted interest.    The significance which was attached to the exhibition was  emphasized by the presence of the ministers of defense of  France, Great Britain, Iran, Russia and Italy at its opening.  Observers could see the leading countries' latest arms in action  for the first time and compare their effectiveness. This was  largely explained by the fact that the Arab countries have begun  to modernize their armed forces based on the experience of the  Persian Gulf War. During the last two years, they have spent  approximately $40 billion on arms purchases. Naturally arms  exporters counted on concluding major new contracts. What are  the results in this sense for Russia?    On the eve of the opening of the exhibition, we learned that  the UAE [United Arab Emirates] had decided to purchase 390  Leclerc Tanks and tank escorts from the French State Corporation  "GIAT Industries" for a total sum of more than $3 billion. This  occurred despite the fact that the Russian T-80 tank showed  itself to be better than the others.    Critical analysis of the issue of purchasing French tanks  lasted for several years. Naturally, a certain amount of time  will be required to prepare and sign contract documents with  potential customers under conditions of recently made decisions  on the possibility of exporting the domestically-produced T-80  tank. Despite substantial expenditures on the organization of  the exhibition at Abu Dhabi, the great success of Russian arms  permits us to hope for their sales on the external market.    Russia's participation was more modest at the 1993 Le  Bourget  Airshow, however, the Aviation Complex imeni Ilyushin managed to  conclude a contract. The MiG Scientific-Production Complex  reached an agreement on the sale of new trainer-transport  aircraft with French Snecma engines.    Moscow Airshow-93 was conducted from 31 August through 5  September. Foreign firms were involved in the preparations for  this exhibition.    So, one could say that Russia is learning arms sales under  contemporary conditions. However, as Russian Presidential  Advisor M.D. Maley says, the world arms market is a subtle  thing, it is an elite market. Previously, an ideological  demarcation shut us out of many arms purchasing countries and  this largely suited our competitors which first and foremost is  the United States.    At the present time, the United States has announced the  establishment of most favored nation trading status with Russia.  However, the opening of U.S. markets for Russian missile,  nuclear and space technologies does not cause ecstasy among  American firms. The firms can obtain support in the U.S.  Congress which has the right to unilaterally terminate this  status or to introduce restrictions. Already right now 20  anti-dumping procedures are in force or are in the stage of  adoption with regard to Russian goods. So, the United States has  banned the import of our uranium until its price reaches $13 per  pound (Russia has sold uranium for $9.50 per pound).    A complex situation has emerged with Russia's attempt to  sell  MiG-29 fighter aircraft to Malaysia. Having learned about the  negotiations that were being conducted with Russia, the U.S.  embassy exerted pressure on McDonnell-Douglas and General  Dynamics which reduced the prices for F-16 and F-18 aircraft by  approximately 40%. It has turned out that the Americans  are  getting in the Russians way. However, considering the high  tactical-technical specifications of MiG-29 fighter aircraft,  the Government of Malaysia announced its decision to purchase 18  aircraft from Russia and eight American F-18 fighter aircraft.  This is a serious success on the arms market and for the first  time Russia will enter a market with its arms that was  previously closed to it (FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, No 35, 1993).    Up to now, the Americans are seeking to cancel the $400  million contract on Russia's delivery of cryogenic missile  engines to India. The United States asserts that these engines  can be utilized for the Indian "Agni" Ballistic Missile and  sales of missile technologies are banned by international  agreements. The Americans have agreed to compensate Russia for  losses, however, they are demanding that the contract with India  be canceled first. The absence of an agreement on this issue was  one of the causes of the cancellation of the Russian Federation  Prime Minister's visit to the United States in June 1993.  Russia's refusal to carry out the U.S.'s demand on the extension  of the monitoring regime for the utilization of missile  technologies to Russia's mutual relations with the other CIS  countries was another cause. We cannot agree to that demand  because the Russian Federation space industry is closely tied to  Ukraine and Kazakhstan.    The United States is also utilizing the European Community  (EC) and COCOM in the competitive struggle. Although COCOM  should allegedly cease to exist, for now it continues to impede  Russia's penetration into the international arms market. So, for  example, this organization bans the purchase from Russia of  ecologically clean fuel for space system missile engines.  Therefore, 200 tonnes of hydrogen chloride are released into the  atmosphere during each launch in the United States that cause a  great deal of ecological damage (IZVESTIYA, No 17, 29 January  1993). The EC, treating Russia as a country with a state trade  system, is establishing reduced quotas for Russian goods.    In order to have success in a fierce competitive struggle,  we  need not only to have good quality weapons but we also need to  know how to sell.    Right now, reliable partners, who are not restricted only to  sales but who can provide maintenance to the weapons sold, are  highly valued on the arms market. According to American experts,  today Russia has those capabilities but is incapable of  competing with American high technology weapons. Therefore, they  think that Russia can successfully sell lower quality weapons on  the market by offering MiG-29 aircraft, air defense missiles,  and small arms there (SEGODNYA, No 17, 18 May 1993).    Russia needs to resolve a number of organizational issues to  carry out successful arms sales.    The Committee for the Defense Sectors of Industry has  specifically proposed a new concept for Russia's  military-technical cooperation with other countries. The concept  provides the capability to the arms manufacturer itself to seek  customers in countries with which military-technical cooperation  has not been prohibited. It can also demonstrate its "goods" to  the customer and tell the customer the tactical-technical  specifications that are authorized for arms exports and a  preliminary price. They propose stimulating commercial arms  deliveries through the use of state credits, beneficial  taxation, and exemption from payment of export duties. For  example, in the United States, the government extends credit for  up to 50% of these deliveries.    Furthermore, Committee Head V. Glukhikh thinks that it is  necessary to privatize the overwhelming number of defense  enterprises. Enterprises and organizations, that have key  technologies at their disposal for the development of arms and  military equipment without which it is impossible for Russia to  maintain its defense capability, need to be retained as state  property (SEGODNYA, No 26, 1993).    A number of market structures are being created in the  Russian military industrial complex system. The  semi-governmental organization Biznestsentr [Business Center]  has been organized which is carrying out the selection of  foreign partners. The second structure -- is the Financial  Company, within which the Military-Industrial Bank is being  formed with high charter capital. Furthermore, the Russian  Military-Industrial Insurance Company and the Information  Association are being founded.    At the same time, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations' specialized foreign economic organizations, while  implementing the concept for reorganizing their own structures  that was approved in April 1993 by the Russian Federation  Interdepartmental Commission for Military-Technical Cooperation  with Foreign Countries (KVTS), began to intensively work on  ensuring more active participation of the main Russian arms  developers and manufacturers in foreign economic activity. These  specialized foreign economic organizations conclude the absolute  majority of the actual deals for arms and military equipment  deliveries to foreign countries and render technical assistance  in the organization of their production and operation. So, the  multi-discipline Consultative-Oversight Council was formed under  the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, the working sections  of which are specialized along the KVTS' primary functional  directions and have adequately broad powers both for the  formation of export programs of subdepartmental foreign economic  associations ("Oboroneksport", "Spetsvneshtekhnika", and GUSK  [not found]) and also for monitoring, strategy, tactics and  coordination of the practical work of Russian subjects of  military-technical cooperation in foreign arms markets. In the  future, vertically integrated financial-industrial groups could  be formed that are combined based upon on the common economic  interests of the leading exporters, developers and manufacturers  of domestically-produced weapons and also bank, insurance and  other structures that are comprehensively oriented on  stimulating the export of military machine-technical products  and special technologies.    The future will tell how all of these organizational  measures  affect the success of the Russian military industrial complex on  the international market.    In conclusion, let's point out several other problems that  are associated with arms sales. One of them is the clearance  sale of arms of the USSR Armed Forces that have remained on the  territory of the states of the near abroad. So, arms sales from  auctions have been stepped up in Kharkov. There the director of  the Ukraine-Siberia Goods Exchange, that previously sold  petroleum and grain, now sells arms at reduced prices. In the  exchange's competitive pricing, Su-27 fighter aircraft are worth  $32 million, Su-25's -- $11.9 million, MiG-27's -- $16 million  and, diesel submarines -- from $13 to $150 million. Such "wild"  sales of Soviet arms not only damage Russia's interests but also  introduce a definite imbalance in the world market. The origin  of the arms that are appearing on the "wild" market and to whom  they are being sold remains unclear. Western diplomats are also  concerned about the shady deals in the Central Asian republics  of the former USSR.    Scotland Yard thinks that in five years the main threat to  the cities of Great Britain will emanate from the countries of  Central and Eastern Europe and Russia. Scotland Yard is certain  that the influx of arms from there is destabilizing the  situation in the country.    The appearance of new sellers on the world market is another  problem. India, which traditionally purchased armored vehicles  and missiles in the USSR, has now developed its own "Arjun"  Tank, the "Prithvi" Ballistic Missile with an operating range of  50 km, and the "Akash" Air Defense Missile Complex. India  displayed its military products at Abu Dhabi and it already  plans to offer the "Arjun" Tank for sale at the international  armored vehicle exhibition in Canada in 1994.    The international community is concerned about new trends on  the arms market. The UN General Assembly Resolution on the  creation of the Conventional Arms Register went into force on 1  May 1993. All arms exporters and importers must submit official  data to the UN on arms sales and purchases with an indication of  the total amount of arms bought or sold. The UN thinks that the  absence of such a Register permitted the Husayn Regime to  purchase arms throughout the world and to create the fourth most  powerful army in the world.    By 11 May, 47 countries had submitted data to the UN. Among  them were the United States, England, France, Germany, Italy,  Brazil, China, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Greece. Cuba acceded to  the Register, having announced that it neither bought nor sold  any heavy weapons whatsoever in 1992. Russia submitted that  information in the middle of the summer of 1993.    All of this is occurring in the background of the overall  reduction of the amounts of sales on the arms market. According  to the assessment of the Stockholm International Peace Research  Institute, the largest arms sales on the world market occurred  in 1987 when $46 billion worth of deals were concluded and this  amount was reduced to $22 billion in 1991 which is by more than  half. The table indicates the dynamics of the decline on the  world arms market in 1987-1991. This trend was maintained in  1992: the volume of deals was reduced by another nearly one  fourth and totaled 18.4 billion rubles. In 1992, the leading  countries' shares were: the United States -- 46%, the  countries  of the European Community (primarily Germany, France, and Great  Britain) -- 26% and, Russia -- 11%.    According to Goskomstat [State Committee for Statistics]  data, Russia exported a total of only $546.1 million worth of  arms in January-May 1993, at that, only $36.2 million worth to  industrially developed countries.    The Volume of Arms Sales of the Largest Arms Producing Countries, in  Billions of Dollars (in 1990 Prices)/% of the Total Volume   Country     1987         1988         1989         1990         1991   USSR        17.7/38.8    15.1/38.5    14.9/39.1    9.7/33.5     3.9/17.7   United      13.7/30.0    11.9/33.0    12.0/31.2    11.2/38.6    11.2/50.8  States   France      3.2/7.0      2.4/6.1      2.9/8.0      1.9/6.5      0.8/3.6   Great       2.2/4.8      1.7/4.3      2.7/7.1      1.6/5.5      1.0/4.5  Britain   China       2.9/6.3      1.9/4.8      0.9/2.4      0.9/3.1      1.1/5.1   FRG         0.8/1.7      1.3/3.3      0.8/2.1      1.2/4.2      2.0/9.1  [Federal  Republic  of  Germany]   Total       45.8/100     39.3/100     38.2/100     29.0/100     22.1/100      We need to note that you can encounter somewhat different  figures than those cited in the table. So, the 7 August 1993  issue of MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS cites the following volumes of  export deliveries of arms and military equipment: in 1987, the  United States -- $16.8 billion, Russia --$17.8 billion, in 1991  -- $13.3 and $6.0 billion and, in 1992 $33 and $1.9 billion,  respectively. In the process, it does not state if the data is  cited in prices of one year. Without becoming involved in an  analysis of which figures are more correct, it is important to  note that the dynamics are preserved in both cases.    The reduction of the arms market is resulting in a reduction  of arms production in the exporting countries. The Pentagon is  reducing arms purchases, is rejecting a number of developments,  and is terminating the SDI Program. Financing of defense  enterprises has been drastically reduced in Russia. The  reduction of defense production is occurring in all of the  developed countries. According to Stockholm International Peace  Research Institute data, total military expenditures of all of  the world's states were reduced by 15% in 1992, in  contrast to  1991.    In the next five years, we anticipate a reduction of the  number of defense enterprise workers by approximately one fourth.    Russia may find itself in an especially difficult situation  where the number of workers and employees at military  enterprises totals 71% of all personnel of the USSR arms  sector  (17.5% in Ukraine, 3.2% in Belarus, and  1.7% in Kazakhstan)  (FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, 23, 1993). Considering that conversion  in Russia is proceeding slowly and with problems, defense  enterprises are experiencing enormous difficulties that are also  affecting the general state of the country.    All of these factors will result in even greater  intensification of competition on the international arms market.  Russia must take into account that, on the one hand, it can only  access this market with high quality modern weapons and, on the  other hand, cadres and skill are needed to achieve success under  conditions of the fierce competition under which the most varied  methods and techniques are utilized.    We must understand that the United States, being the largest  seller on the international arms market, will impede the  expansion of Russia's positions in this market.    Right now, many defense enterprises in Russia are tying  their  future with successes on the world arms market. Considering  their significance in total industrial production, we can arrive  at the conclusion that the successful resolution of the arms  sales task plays a large role for Russia's future.</p>

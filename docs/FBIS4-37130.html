Brother 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri also visited the families of  victims of the barbarous indiscriminate shelling suffered by a  number of residential districts in the capital, Aden, which came  from the forces of the military regime in Sanaa and resulted in  the deaths and wounding of 30 women, children, elderly persons,  and peaceful civilians.

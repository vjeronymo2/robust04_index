Among the improvements it has instituted as a result of 'patient/user' feed back is the re-introduction of the title Matron. And what was the incumbent called before? 'Director of nursing services and quality' says a hospital spokesman. All that award-winning work notwithstanding, 'lots of patients hadn't realised what that was'.</p>

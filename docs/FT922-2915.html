			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Survey of Greece (1): Urgent need for reforms - Greece's economic troubles show few signs of abating. A stabilisation programme launched last year with the aim of closing the gap with the rest of the EC has fallen far behind schedule. Structural reforms that would curtail spending have been postponed FOR all its years of European Community membership, Greece sometimes bears more resemblance to its Balkan neighbours than to its European partners. The current outburst of nationalist feeling against recognising Macedonia, the former Yugoslav republic adjoining northern Greece, is a case in point. Senior officials will discuss arcane aspects of regional history with an eloquence that is lacking when the question of preparations for European monetary union comes up. Yet Greece's economic troubles show few signs of abating. The stabilisation programme launched last year with the aim of closing the gap with the rest of the EC, has fallen well behind schedule. This was not entirely unexpected, given that extremely stiff terms were agreed with the European Commission in return for an Ecu2.2bn (Pounds 1.54bn) special loan in three instalments. But in addition to missing the targets set for curbing inflation and the ballooning public sector deficit, the government postponed launching structural reforms that would effectively curtail spending. The result is a prolonged period of embarrassment for Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the prime minister, and Mr Stefanos Manos, his new economy minister. They cannot ask for payment of the second tranche of the loan until some lost ground has been made up and the Commission approves the Greek plan for achieving economic convergence with its EC partners by 1997. Mr Manos, a former businessman who trained at Harvard, is well aware that despite the uncertainty generated by the Danish decision to reject the Maastricht treaty, structural reform remains urgent. The Greek predicament was recently underlined by Portugal's entry to the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System, which leaves the drachma as the only currency outside the system. Even the most optimistic of Greek bankers believe that it will be at least another year before the inflation rate drops enough for Greek entry to be possible. However, Mr Mitsotakis is an old-fashioned politician who finds it difficult to resist pressure from special interest groups. In public he stresses the danger that because of its weak economy, Greece will not be able to function as an equal partner in the Community. Yet he appears to condone delay as the price of eventually winning cabinet acceptance for the measures proposed by Mr Manos and his advisers. Mr Manos advocates another five years of austerity, with minimal wage increases and deep spending cuts with the aim of halving the deficit by 1997. Growth would be stimulated by increased EC assistance - including the new 'cohesion fund' for poorer members - for important projects to improve transport and telecommunications. But with a rebellious cabinet and only a one-seat majority in parliament, Mr Mitsotakis feels obliged to tread cautiously. Several of his potential successors as leader of the conservative New Democracy party are no longer members of the government. At present, Mr Mitsotakis is also his own foreign minister, having sacked the youthful foreign minister, Mr Antonis Samaras, in a well-publicised dispute over his handling of the Macedonian problem. Ask a constituency worker in New Democracy why economic reform is so painfully slow and the answer comes at once: 'Political cost.' It is clear to almost everyone that the measures demanded by the terms of the EC loan will deal a fatal blow to the all-pervasive patronage system by which the ruling party rewards its supporters with public sector jobs. Modernisation of the civil service is proving one of the most contentious issues. The government agreed to trim 50,000 jobs by 1993, amounting to 10 per cent of the civil service payroll. But as the Commission pointed out in a recent report on the Greek economy, instead of shrinking, the number of civil servants grew by 4.4 per cent last year. The government has decided to tackle the other potentially explosive problem first: overhauling the welfare system in order to reduce pension outlays which, together with wages, add up to about 40 per cent of budget spending. Proposals from an experts' committee include gradually raising the pensionable age to 60 by the end of the decade and extending years of service. Women, for example, will no longer qualify for a pension in their mid-30s after only 15 years in a job. A fierce reaction to the changes is expected, led by the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), whose generous welfare policies in the 1980s, combined with a disregard for revenue-raising, are held responsible for the present impasse. Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Pasok leader, is in more vigorous form after his acquittal by a special court of corruption while in office. His health appears to have improved, while the prospect of mounting a campaign against the government's restrictive social policies cannot fail to appeal to his populist instincts. Support for the government has weakened with the imposition this year of a wage freeze in the public sector. Several thousand jobs have been lost through sales and closures of debt-ridden nationalised companies under the government's wide-ranging privatisation programme. Unemployment is rising, especially among the young and unskilled whose chances of finding a job are reduced by the presence of more than 150,000 Albanian, Bulgarian and Polish immigrants working illegally in Greece. However, the mood is brighter in the private sector. Businessmen say they are well placed to take advantage of the reforms that have been introduced. Almost all price controls have been lifted in the past year. A new tax law making its way through parliament provides for deep cuts in corporation tax and sharply reduced income tax for both high and low earners. Despite gloomy predictions, no massive flight of capital followed the lifting of curbs on medium-term capital movement. In fact, business confidence improved, with capital inflows remaining at fairly high levels. There is now talk of liberalising remaining exchange controls by 1993, rather than seeking a two-year postponement already sanctioned by the Community. In the view of many bankers, this could help bring home a substantial proportion of the estimated Dollars 10bn held by Greeks in overseas bank accounts. While the Foreign Ministry flaunts its disagreements with Balkan neighbours, Greek businessmen are quietly developing contacts. Greece is officially annoyed with Bulgaria for recognising Macedonian independence and for drawing closer to its traditional enemy, Turkey. But the flourishing Greek food-processing industry is starting to invest there, and a growing list of joint ventures includes manufacturing units on both sides of the border. Even in Albania, where relations are dogged by mutual suspicion and official recriminations over treatment of the North Epirots, the ethnic Greek minority in the south of the country, tentative steps are being taken. Greeks are involved in a number of farming projects and small textile plants. Still, Greece cannot make a lasting contribution to the development of market economies in the Balkans unless the muddle over recognising Macedonia is cleared up and its own economy is on the road to convergence. If Mr Mitsotakis continues his delays, both this and the other opportunities offered by closer European co-operation will simply disappear.</p>

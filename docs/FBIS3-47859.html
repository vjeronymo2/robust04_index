			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Phnom Penh, Jan 20 (AFP) - A bitter argument  between Cambodian Finance Minister Sam Rangsi and a major Thai  business group went public Thursday as some 1,000 students and  businessmen demonstrated in support of the minister.    Local market vendors, students and other businessmen showed  up in front of the parliament to denounce the Thai Bunrong  business consortium for the exhorbitant rents it planned to  charge for use of a recently completed shopping mall. [passage  omitted]    Another group carried a banner proclaiming, "Students for  Sam  Rangsi," while others carried signs echoing the minister's  recent call for "good investors to come" to Cambodia "and drive  out the bad."    The minister had backed local business groups in their  protest against the Thai group.    A representative of the Khmer Patriotic Youth Association  said his group was at the gathering because the fight was not  only for local interests, but also symbolic of defending  national interests. [passage omitted]    Thai Bunrong group chairman Theng Bun-Ma had published an  open letter in a local paper, which his group owns, accusing Sam  Rangsi of being a "low grade individual," and addressing him as  "the Minister of Destroying Economics and Finance." [passage  omitted]    In his letter, Theng Bun-Ma further accused the minister of  being ungracious, saying he should not criticise officials of  the previous administration as he owed his presence in Cambodia  to them. [passage omitted]    Separately, elsewhere in the capital, military police tried  unsuccessfully to evict a group of over 20 soldiers and their  families who were squatting on state land which has been rented  out for development.    The heavily armed soldiers, loyal to the former military  wings of the royalist FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an  Indpendent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] party  and the small Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party, threatened to  defend themselves if they were forcibly evicted.    "We have fought for many years on the battlefield and we are  not afraid of dying here," said one soldier, brandishing a M-16  assault rifle.    Police General Kong Saran, however, said the soldiers and  their families had just arrived on the site Tuesday after having  travelled from northwest Cambodia.    A government official said he suspected there was "a  political background to the issue," adding that the squatters  might be part of a deliberate attempt to highlight the problem  of the sale of state property.</p>

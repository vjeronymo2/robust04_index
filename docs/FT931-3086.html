			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / People: Sutherland comes to Ross Ross Group, the acquisitive consumer electronics and packaging company which lost its high-profile chairman Roger Shute last June, has hired former ITT executive Neil Sutherland as its group managing director. When Shute stepped down because of ill-health from his non-executive position, managing director Noel Hayes took on the additional role of chairman while a replacement was found. Hayes remains executive chairman. 'Roger's departure was merely a catalyst. We had almost decided to bring on another senior executive anyway,' claims Hayes, pointing out how the group has grown since he joined in October 1989, with turnover last year at Pounds 50m, compared with Pounds 6m then. The company was also loathe to look for a non-executive chairman - 'some City dignitary who would charge Pounds 10,000 and arrive for six free lunches a year'. Instead it hopes it has found in 53-year-old Sutherland someone who both subscribes to the company's philosophy - success by working 'longer and harder' than the competition - and who complements existing skills on the board. Hayes, 36, came from the City, with a short stint as senior sales director of Kleinwort Benson Securities, preceded by positions at Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers. Finance director Anthony Schofield has a traditional accountancy background. Sutherland, by contrast, has spent most of his life in big company manufacturing, largely concerned with consumer electronics. An engineering graduate from Edinburgh University, he started out with Nuclear Enterprises, before moving to Plessey. In 1982, he joined Dubilier, working in the US as well as the UK. Three years later he moved to ITT, where he spent eight years as managing director of the ITT Cannon Group, supplying components and systems to telecommun-ications, auto, consumer and industrial electronics markets. Ross has still to dispel completely what Hayes himself has termed 'the Roger Shute effect' whereby the share price dived following Shute's exit. It has only partially recovered, trading in the 30p-33p range in the last couple of months. 'I am very happy to be judged by our results,' says Hayes. The company reports on April 8. ***** BM Group, another company once chaired by Roger Shute, has taken steps to strengthen its board. The construction equipment and engineering concern has appointed Richard Miles, former chief executive of Steetley, as a non-executive director. It will be the most demanding role Miles has taken on since Steetley lost out to a hostile Pounds 613m takeover bid by rival building materials group Redland a year ago. His other activities include the non-executive chairmanship of Bucknall Group, a construction consultancy. Following a collapse in its performance, BM had been looking for another experienced non-executive to support a root-and-branch review being carried out under its new chairman Moger Woolley.</p>

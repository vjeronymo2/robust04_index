			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Arts: 'I lombardi' with Pavarotti - Opera in New York This is an odd Met season: the three new home-grown productions are all of Verdi operas, two of which are early pieces the company has never staged before. Six weeks ago there was Stiffelio; now comes a work to make that opera seem a triumph of sober maturity and deep interest: the ramshackle story of fraternal rivalry, changed allegiances, betrayal and baptism, hermit and heroine, battles and blessings set among the Lombards at the First Crusade. Time and the critics have not been kind to I lombardi. It was the first Verdi opera to be performed in America - in 1847, four years after its introduction at La Scala - but then inevitably was rapidly overtaken by later works, and Verdi himself seems to have hoped to hasten its burial by recasting it, also in 1847, as Jerusalem. Julian Budden calls it 'an agglomeration of heterogeneous ideas, some remarkable, some unbelievably banal' - a judgment which the Met production cannot but sustain. Beautifully modulated responses to Bellinian cantabile flow up against the blocky contours of trivial choruses; fine orchestral moments - some of them very fine indeed, and exquisitely played under James Levine - exist alongside raucous march tunes. There is the feeling of a sensibility at war with itself, which may be the composer's response to the bellicose subject matter, but which may also be the flailing of a young artist beginning to gain possession of his talents but not yet certain how to use them. The result is conspicuous wastefulness. I lombardi is almost baroque in its scenic demands, requiring at least ten different sets and several costume changes for the chorus. Happily these are areas in which the Met excels. John Conklin, the set designer, provides a useful unity and grandness of image by keeping a row of great gold-panelled doors along each side of the stage, and his conjurings of the different locales are quick, emblematic and strong: a Romanesque arcade and rose window for the basilica of the first scene, Moorish arches for the tyrant of Antioch's palace, a painted landscape for the River Jordan, a cyclorama of mustard light for the desert. Dunya Ramicova's costumes are also simple and colourful - especially the patterned robes of the Antiochans and the copper armour of the crusaders. Nowhere, rightly, is there much effort at historical accuracy: these are broad, modern reactions to the 19th century reacting to the 11th. I lombardi is also wasteful in its treatment of minor characters. Viclinda, cause of the dispute between the brothers, sings briefly in the first scene; by the next act her daughter is praying to her spirit, without anyone having bothered to tell us she had died. The tyrant of Antioch has his hot moment at the start of that act, goes off almost at once to fight the invaders, and returns as a corpse. Sofia, his wife, appears in just one scene, where her sole function is to serve as an admiring audience for her son, Oronte. Since this is Luciano Pavarotti's role, she acts as the embodiment of the entire house - or certainly did so on the opening night, when Pavarotti was at his most mellifluous and persuasive in this mama's boy aria. His tone was unfailingly sweet, his comportment of the voice between registers assured, and his decoration nimbly executed without disturbance to the line. This was artistry. Sadly,he slackened his care and attention in his later scenes, though there were excuses for that. In his love duet with the Christian Giselda he had to hold to his line - and he did - against Aprile Millo's disturbing mistunings (and she was as zealous in holding to her quarter-tones). In his reappearance from the dead, the absurdity, together with his backward placement on the stage, may have been responsible for encouraging a more uniform, and uniformly loud, treatment. Samuel Ramey, as Pagano, was more consistent in his singing, and in his vivid presence: he alone on stage conveyed the impression he thought he was in something that mattered. And he did so despite the fact that the piece required him to present not one character but two, with no opportunity for developing one out of the other. In the first act Pagano is naked villain: Ramey aptly and ably used that bark, particularly on long 'a' sounds, that he can produce without damage to his melody. In the following three acts, where the move to the Holy Land finds the wicked brother become a sombre eremite, he softened in tone, but not in power. Even when prayerful and subdued, he was in command. The honours belonged to him, to Pavarotti in his first aria, and to Levine and the orchestra, whose leader, Raymond Gniewek, played decorously in the violin concerto which underlies the whole last scene of the third act. Bruno Beccaria was stark as the good brother Arvino. Anthony Laciura made startling use of his high tenor as the Milanese grandee who comes rushing into the opening scene with news of the coming crusade: Mark Lamos's production'otherwise neutral, except in some regrettable choreographing of the chorus'made him look like a Russian holy fool, which was effective. The production remains in repertory until January 20, though Ramey leaves it after Christmas.</p>

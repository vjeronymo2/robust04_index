As it has been reported,  North Korea claims that it has never agreed with the United  States on the inter-Korean exchange of special envoys as a  precondition for the third round of North Korean-U.S. high-level  talks, thereby showing a negative attitude in the inter-Korean  working contact. Moreover, the nuclear inspection on North  Korea by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] appears  to be running into a problem.    The ROK and the United States, therefore, are struggling for  appropriate measures to cope with this situation. U.S. Assistant  Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, who came to the ROK on 10  March, his entourage, and relevant government officials are  supposed to hold a series of meetings on 11 and 12 March to  intensively discuss countermeasures.    Assistant Secretary Gallucci, who heads the U.S. delegation  to the North Korean-U.S. high-level talks, came to Seoul to  coordinate the ROK and U.S. positions on the third round of  North Korean-U.S. talks. However, since doubts raised whether  the third round of talks will be held as scheduled, the ROK-U.S.  talks are expected to discuss various possible scenarios.    The scenarios the ROK and the United States can consider  are:  first, if North Korea sincerely permits the IAEA inspections and  helps realize the inter-Korean exchange of special envoys,  second, if North Korea sincerely permits the IAEA inspections  but does not help realize the inter-Korean exchange of special  envoys before 21 March, and, third, if North Korea obstructs the  IAEA inspections and refuses to realize the inter-Korean  exchange of special envoys.    In case of the first scenario, the most favorable one, the  ROK and the U.S. position is to hold the third round of North  Korean-U.S. talks on 21 March and discuss extensively the North  Korean nuclear issue and the improvement of North Korean-U.S.  relations. The ROK and the United States have set up a policy  that they will demand that North Korea fully return to the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and permit special inspections.  The ROK and the U.S. strategy is not to arrive at a package  solution for the nuclear issue and the North Korean-U.S.  relations, as North Korea demands, but to accede to the North  Korean demands on a step-by-step basis depending upon the degree  of its ensuring nuclear transparency. In other words, the  lifting of restrictions on trips to North Korea, allowing trade  with North Korea except strategic goods, guaranteeing in writing  not waging preemptive strike on North Korea with nuclear arms,  and opening of a liaison offices, can be made on a step-by-step  basis. Assistant Secretary Gallucci, in meeting with relevant  ROK Government officials, is expected to explain the U.S. plan  as to what sort of "carrot" it could present for the North  Korean demands, and adjust and coordinate the U.S. position with  the ROK.    In case North Korea sincerely permits the inspections but  refuses to exchange special envoys before 21 March, the ROK and  the U.S. position is to postpone the third round of North  Korean-U.S. talks until the envoy exchange is made. However,  noncompliance with the promise for the envoy exchange itself is  not enough to take the issue on sanctions on North Korea to the  UN Security Council, so the ROK and the United States will  continue to persuade North Korea to help realize the envoy  exchange.    The worst scenario is the case in which North Korea refuses  to sincerely permit the IAEA inspections and to exchange special  envoys. It has been reported that North Korea raised some  objections to the IAEA inspection team's activities and  postponed the taking of test samples from the radioactive  chemical laboratory and the five-megawatt nuclear reactor, thus  taking an uncooperative attitude. The basic ROK-U.S. position  is that if North Korea refuses to permit the inspections of its  key nuclear facilities in the present IAEA inspection, which is  scheduled to end on 14 March, North Korea will have to be  subjected to sanctions by the UN Security Council.    The ROK and the United States have set up a policy that they  will endeavor to bring a complete resolution of the North Korean  nuclear issue through the third round of the North Korean-U.S.  talks. They will discuss various countermeasures, but their  agony continues because they will have to overcome many  obstacles in view of the North Korean attitude.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> U.S. TO CLOSE KOREA CENTER  </P> <P> The American cultural center in Kwangju, South Korea, target of nearly 30  anti-American attacks since 1980, will be closed and moved, the U.S. Embassy in  Seoul announced. "We're concerned about the threat to human life, especially in  that building . . . . It's not sufficiently defensible," an embassy spokesman  said. The spokesman said that Washington and South Korea are negotiating on  where it will be relocated. The decision to move was announced nine days before  the anniversary of a civilian uprising in Kwangju on May 18, 1980, that was  suppressed by then-President Chun Doo Hwan. About 200 people were killed in  that incident, by official count, but residents say many more died.  </P></p>

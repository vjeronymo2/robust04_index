			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: CS Holding confirms Volksbank takeover CS HOLDING, parent company of the financial group built around Credit Suisse, has confirmed it will go ahead with its SFr1.6bn (Dollars 1.05bn) agreed takeover of Swiss Volksbank. CS said that by the time of the expiry of its offer yesterday, 93 per cent of Volksbank shares had been tendered. The takeover will enable CS to surpass Union Bank of Switzerland to become Switzerland's largest financial group in terms of assets. The all-share offer, announced on January 6, has advanced smoothly. Volksbank, which tumbled into a SFr68m loss last year, had first to win shareholders' approval to convert itself from a co-operative into a joint stock company. In the event, the enabling resolution was passed without a murmur of dissent at an extraordinary general meeting last week. Under Swiss law, the offer, on the basis of three new CS registered shares for every 10 Volksbank registered shares, must be extended for 10 banking days in order to enable the remaining Volksbank shareholders to take advantage of it. CS said the new shares would be issued in mid-April.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Jeyes turns in 20% advance to Pounds 2.11m JEYES GROUP, the rapidly growing cleaning products group, yesterday demonstrated the resilience of the UK's household goods market by reporting a 20 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the six months to July 11. The improvement, from Pounds 1.76m to Pounds 2.11m, came from sales ahead 17 per cent at Pounds 35.9m, with the growth almost entirely internally generated. Earnings per share rose from 8.3p to 9.9p. In line with the forecast in July when the group made an Pounds 18m acquisition of Globol of Neuberg, Germany, the group is to pay a 3.1p interim dividend, a 19 per cent increase. 'The UK market was much stronger than we thought,' said Mr Jimmy Moir, managing director, referring to the bleach, moist wipes and lavatory cleaner markets, which grew, and disinfectants which shrank by just 2 per cent. Internationally, sales grew 40 per cent and now account for 35 per cent of profits. Mr Moir said there was great potential for earnings enhancement at Globol, which was making operating margins of only 2-3 per cent, compared to Jeyes' overall 7 per cent. The group could benefit from the kind of attention that Jeyes received after the management buy-out he led from Cadbury Schweppes in 1986. The acquisition of Globol, which expands group sales by about two thirds in a full year, will greatly increase Jeyes' international presence. Had Globol been included this year the group would have 40 per cent of sales in the UK, 20 per cent in Germany, 20 per cent in the rest of Europe and the balance in the rest of the world. Gearing at the half year was unchanged at 40 per cent. Interest was six times covered by operating profits. COMMENT The most surprising aspect of these good results is that the UK household market remains so strong in spite of the recession. While Jeyes has had to forgo some margin, its market share in the UK has increased and internationally growth has been nothing short of phenomenal, led by a Japanese love-affair with the 'Blu' lavatory hygiene blocks. Jeyes' next few years of earnings growth is also pretty much guaranteed from margin improvement, cross-marketing and cost-cutting at Globol, acquired in July. The problem for investors who did not join the bandwagon when the MBO vehicle came to the USM is that most of this good news is already in the price. A full-year pre-tax profits forecast of Pounds 5.5m, or 21.8p of earnings, puts the shares on a multiple of 21, already at a 50 per cent premium to the market.</p>

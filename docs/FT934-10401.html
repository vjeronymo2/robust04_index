			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: BT BT's share price fall yesterday afternoon suggests US investors took fright at Mr Iain Vallance's carefully-worded caution on the dividend. They probably need not worry much. BT cannot allow dividend expectations to get out of hand, and an 8.1 per cent increase looks generous with inflation below 2 per cent. But its strictures also serve to impress upon Oftel that the new price controls are biting. The underlying reality is that BT faces little cash constraint. Gearing is only 14 per cent even after large payments to its pension fund and on MCI. Perhaps BT also wants to silence calls for a large hand-out to shareholders. The looser the dividend discipline, though, the greater the temptation to fritter away its surplus unwisely.</p>

This is a contracting budget. According to the  budget, the financial budget for FY1995 will be reduced to  $176.1 billion through cutting defense expenditures, suspending  over 100 government undertakings, laying off redundant civil  servants, and administrative restructuring. The deficit will be  $100 billion less than estimated by the Bush administration. If  this plan can be carried through, it will be the first time  since the Truman administration that the United States has  succeeded in reducing its deficit for three successive years.    The Clinton administration has focused on reforming the  medical insurance system. If reform can be carried out  successfully in FY1995, another $11 billion will be saved.    According to the Clinton administration's new budget, total  expenditure in 1995 will be $1.518 trillion, up 2.3 percent over  the previous year, while the total annual revenue is 1.342  trillion, up 7.4 percent over the previous year. The increase  in annual revenue is due to the tax-raising policy introduced  last year and to increases in tax revenue brought about by  economic recovery.  <H5>  The Growth Rate in 1994 is 3.1 Percent </H5>   Since the Clinton administration's new budget will bring the  deficit down to $176.1 billion, which is the lowest for the last  six years, and the unemployment rate will go down slowly due to  economic recovery, the United States' economic growth for 1994  and 1995 is estimated to hit 3.1 and 2.8 percent respectively,  which shows that the U.S. economy is improving. Bill Clinton  himself maintains that the goal of "a low inflation rate and a  sustained and steady development of the economy" has been  attained and he is more confident about future economic  development.    It should be noted that the improvement in some economic  indicators, such as the improvement in the unemployment and  inflation rates, began during the Bush administration and have  become more evident recently. Therefore, we cannot attribute  all the economic improvement to Clinton, who has only been in  office for a little more than a year.  <H5>  Reduced Defense Expenditure in Post-Cold War Period </H5>   Continued cuts in defense spending in the post-cold war  period have made it possible for the Clinton administration to  reduce the deficit and apply itself to revitalizing the economy.  Total defense expenditure for FY1995 (from October 1994 to  September 1995) is $263.7 billion, down 0.9 percent from the  previous year. As a result, the Defense Department reduced its  existing 1.6 million-strong army by 100,000 and decided to focus  on improving the quality of national defense by building new  aircraft carriers and more advanced submarines.    Apart from the defense department, 10 of the 14 most  important departments, including the agriculture, energy, and  state departments, will slash their administrative expenditures  according to their actual performance last year, which will  result in, among other things, the laying off of 118,000 civil  servants.    But the foreign trade deficit cannot be reduced by a big  margin. The foreign trade deficit for FY1995 is estimated to  stand at between $135 and $175 billion, and the international  payments deficit at between $105 and 145 billion, both higher  than the actual figures for FY1993. What is of top importance  is how Clinton will carry out reforms in the medical insurance  system, the result of which is difficult to predict. Reforming  the old, defective and wasteful medical care system involves the  immediate interests of the American people. If the government  cuts subsidies, this will meet great opposition from all  quarters because smaller government subsidies means bigger  individual burdens; but if the government gives in, the  obstinate economic illness will defy a cure.    In addition, the government will lay off 252,000 civil  servants in the next five years. These people, who will become  jobless, will certainly oppose the Clinton administration's  austerity policy. Therefore, a number of economists are not  optimistic about specific reforms to the medical care system.  It is still too early to say whether the unemployment rate will  be reduced.</p>

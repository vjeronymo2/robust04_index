			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: UK guilty of breach in water standards THE European Court of Justice yesterday found the UK government guilty of breaking EC rules on drinking-water quality - the first time the UK has been convicted by the court of a breach of environmental standards. The court backed a complaint from the European Commission that nitrate levels in 28 supply zones in England in 1989 exceeded permitted limits, and that the UK had failed to implement EC directives in time. It accepted that the UK was rectifying the situation. It threw out a second complaint from the Commission that lead levels exceeded legal limits. The affected zones, out of a total of 2,000 in England and Wales, were all in East Anglia, supplied by Anglian Water and Cambridge Water. Speaking in Copenhagen, Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said the UK would comply with the EC directive in 12 of the areas mentioned in the ruling by the end of this year, and in the remainder by the end of 1995. 'It would not have been practicable to have complied sooner,' he said. 'There is no danger to health in any of the areas. If there were, we would have taken steps sooner.' Mr David Maclean, environment minister, added that the ruling was 'mainly about technicalities rather than the quality of the UK's drinking water and refers only to certain aspects of the situation as it was in 1989.' But Friends of the Earth, the environmental group that first made the complaint about the UK's failure to meet requirements in 1986, called the ruling a 'landmark decision' and a 'major embarrassment for the government'. It urged that polluters, mainly farmers who use fertilisers that release nitrates into water, and not consumers should bear the costs of meeting requirements on nitrates - estimated at about Pounds 155m. Mr Mike Swallow, director of the Water Companies Association, said the water industry was involved in a Pounds 14bn investment programme to meet environmental standards. Yet 98.7 per cent of more than 3m water samples tested by the government's drinking water inspectorate in 1991 already met all EC requirements. The EC directive was issued in 1980 and was due to be in practice by 1985. The UK government argued that it imposed no obligation to achieve a result, but required every effort to meet the standards within the time limit. Yesterday's court judgment was that member states were obliged to achieve results. Lex, Page 22</p>

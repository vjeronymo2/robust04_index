The rule is intended to inform potential claimants of the circumstances under which the RTC will consider claims based upon acts or omissions of the receiver to be timely filed and to clarify when suit may be filed on these claims. The rule will thus inform and remind potential claimants of the deadlines applicable to claims and suits based upon acts or omissions of receivers. Comments received from the public will be considered in determining the form of a final rule. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> dates:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before October 24, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> addresses:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments concerning the proposed rule should be addressed to John M.

H.R. Rep. No. 101&hyph;54(I), 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 2,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> reprinted in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1989 U.S. CODE CONG. &amp; ADMIN. NEWS 215. These purposes are fulfilled by requiring that, before suit can be filed, the receivership claims process must be exhausted with respect to claims based upon acts or omissions of the RTC as receiver, since litigation and its accompanying burden on the receivership estate and the courts may be avoided if the receiver is given an initial opportunity to allow meritorious claims outside of litigation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, both the literal terms of 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(13)(D) and the purposes of the statute make it clear that no suit can be maintained against the RTC as receiver based upon any act or omission of the RTC as receiver unless and until the claims process has been pursued. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As of March 31, 1994, the RTC held over 533,000 assets, such as real estate, mortgages and deeds of trust, and commercial and consumer loans. The RTC, as receiver, has entered into and will continue to enter into numerous contracts for the sale of these assets. In addition, the RTC, as receiver, enters into many other contracts relating to its operations. Further, many additional claims arise relating to the conduct of receivership affairs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the number of contracts that the RTC enters into as receiver and because the RTC, as receiver, acts in a wide variety of ways, disputes necessarily arise between the RTC and other persons. In order to fulfill the purposes of the claims process set forth in 12 U.S.C. 1821(d), the RTC is promulgating this proposed rule setting forth procedures applicable to claims based upon acts or omissions of the RTC as receiver. (The proposed rule does not address claims against the RTC in its corporate capacity.) When final, this rule will replace the Interim Statement of Policy Regarding Procedures to be Used with Regard to Claims Based upon Acts or Omissions of the Receiver, 59 FR 10663 (March 7, 1994), which will be superseded in its entirety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act Statement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the RTC hereby certifies that this proposal is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

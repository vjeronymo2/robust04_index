			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Britain breaks rules on satellite TV, says Brussels THE European Commission says Britain is breaking EC law by imposing too many controls on continental European television programmes broadcast into the UK by satellite. In a letter to the UK government, Mr Martin Bangemann, the internal market commissioner, has given London two months to respond to the charge that Britain's 1990 Broadcasting Act could hinder free circulation of television programmes in the EC. The letter, sent on November 3, is the first of three stages which could lead to the UK being taken to the European Court of Justice for not applying the EC's 'television without frontiers' directive properly. However, Commission officials said Brussels was more likely to take a softly-softly approach to ensure compliance. Writing on behalf of the Commission, Mr Bangemann also ob-jects to the BBC's April 1981 Licence and Agreement, which he says imposes a discriminatory 'national quota' by insisting on 'proper proportions of . . . programmes of British origin and British performance'. The EC directive calls for a majority of broadcasting time to be devoted to 'European works'. Similar letters have been sent to all 12 EC member states, some of which have not even tried to implement the directive. The Commission has accused France of discriminating against foreign broadcasters and has alleged that Italy has broken the rules on television advertising. The directive - a foundation of the EC's audiovisual policy - came into force in October 1991, two years after adoption by member states. It sets minimum standards to regulate advertising and protect children from broadcast pornography, violence and racism. Member states can impose stricter standards on their own broadcasters but cannot hamper cross-border TV services from other countries if they meet the minimum EC rules. The Commission's main objection to the UK's Broadcasting Act is that it is too strict on foreign satellite and cable broadcasters transmitting into the UK, and too relaxed about broadcasts from the UK into other member states. Brussels believes the act could force foreign satellite and cable broadcasters to obtain a licence from the Independent Television Commission in the UK, even if already authorised by another member state. This is an illegal 'second control', according to the Commission. It also says that broadcasters transmitting to member states outside the UK would not have to comply with British law and would escape any EC regulation. British officials said the directive had been properly implemented. 'If nobody's managed to implement it correctly, it can't be much of a directive,' said one critic.</p>

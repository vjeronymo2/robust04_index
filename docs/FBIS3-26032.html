			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Cong Yaping (0654 0068 1627)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 20 Jan (XINHUA) -- The just-concluded 1993  saw progress in the construction sector, including engineering,  urban and rural construction, building, real estate, and urban  public utilities.    Addressing the national construction work meeting today,  Construction Minister Hou Jie summarized achievements in  nationwide construction undertakings last year:    -- Engineering construction achieved notable results with  building industry steadily developing. A host of key projects,  including Shanghai's Yangpu Bridge, Guangdong's Dayawan Nuclear  Power Station, second-phase Dalian-Qinhuangdao electric railway  project, and Jinan-Qindao Expressway, have successively  completed and commenced operations. The introduction of an  engineering construction supervision system has brought high  speed, quality, and efficiency.    -- Adaption to the new situation has brought new progress in  urban planning. To meet demands of a new reform situation and  the establishment of a socialist market economic system, various  localities embarked on revising the overall urban planning last  year by speeding up formulation of detailed rules designed to  better control and guide development of new zones,  reconstruction of old areas, and construction of various  development sites in urban areas. The revised overall urban  planning for both Beijing and Changsha have been approved by the  State Council, while initial examinations of that of Nanjing,  Xian, Hangzhou, and Shenyang have completed. The formulation of  transcentury overall urban planning has begun.    -- New successes secured in urban construction included an  additional water supply capacity of 6 million tons per day, gas  supply capacity of 1.6 million cubic meters, waste water  treatment capacity of 800,000 tons, and completed highways  totaling 30 million square meters. Urban public transportation,  particularly car- renting, has been developing rapidly. The  construction of overpasses one over the other has become the  feature of urban communications.    -- Another new record was set in urban and rural housing  construction last year with the completion of more than 900,000  square meters throughout the country. The special housing  policy adopted by the Construction Ministry designed to solve  housing problems has not only relieved housing shortage and  replaced dilapidated houses, but also has boosted nationwide  housing construction.    -- The construction of villages and towns has entered a new  phase. The development of rural economy and the relatively  concentrated development of village and town enterprises have  accelerated the development pace of small towns, which in turn  have brought overall development to adjacent small villages.    Hou Jie pointed out: While witnessing the strong development  in construction undertakings, we should also pay attention to  the solution of contradictions and problems. The ongoing  large-scale construction has brought new challenges to urban  planning and management, with certain localities placing  preference of construction over urban planning. In particular,  certain localities, being too eager to attract foreign funds for  quick success and instant benefit, have blindly leased out lands  without planning and incurred losses. For problems like serious  fund shortage for both urban and rural construction, poor  infrastructure, work quality, and frequent accidents, their  solution needs unremitting efforts.</p>

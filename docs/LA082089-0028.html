			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A SOUND SCANDAL  </P> <P> Andrew Marton is a great writer ("A Scandalous Tour of Washington," July 16),  but did he really take this tour? I doubt it or else he sat in the first row. I  read this in The Times and immediately booked for Aug. 5.  </P> <P> The idea is great and the performances looked like they might be fun, if you  could hear them. The acoustics were so bad on the bus, so distorted that one  was forced to listen so hard that one did not have time to listen for the  scandal. Too bad because the idea is great. We took two guests from D.C. and  they could have sent many more folks. My advice is to save yourself $46 each  and just read and enjoy the article in the paper.  </P> <P> TERRY O'NEILL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

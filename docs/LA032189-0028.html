			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH  </P> <P> Pessimistic traders and short-sellers had their wish come true as the Dow Jones  Industrial Average fell 78 points, or 3.3%, over the past two trading days,  Irving Katz, director of research at Thomas Green/San Diego Securities, said  Monday.  </P> <P> The drop followed the announcement that the producer price index had increased  1% in February or 12.6% on an annual basis, portending a distinct inflationary  environment in the near future.  </P> <P> Interest-sensitive stocks were particularly affected as HomeFed Corp., parent  of Home Federal Savings, was down $1.50 and Great American First Savings Bank  fell $.875. Home Federal had reached a new 52-week high of $33.375 earlier in  the week.  </P> <P> Other stocks selling off were Henley Group, down $4; Rohr Industries, down  $2.50; Xytronyx, down $1.25; and Magma Power and Mail Boxes Etc., each down $1.  New lows were recorded during the past week by Synbiotics and Syntro, a pair of  local biotechnology companies.  </P> <P> The largest gainer of the week was Pancretec, which hit a new high of $14.50 in  response to a bid by Abbott Laboratories to acquire the company for $15 a  share, or $54 million. The stock, which sold at $1.50 in December, 1987, was  selling at $9.625 just two weeks ago.  </P> <P> "It would appear that some (Pancretec) investors were very prescient about the  company's future," Katz said, referring to the more than 40% run-up in  Pancretec's stock price over the past two weeks.  </P> <P> Other stocks, including Humphrey, Molecular Biosystems, DH Technology, and  General Microelectronics reached 52-week highs last week but were unable to  sustain them when the market dropped.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Phnom Penh KAMLANG SETTHAKECH THMEI in  Cambodian in its 1-15 June issue carries the following reports  concerning economic and financial issues:    Concerning the bill on taxes that Minister of Economy and  Finance Sam Rangsi recently proposed to the cabinet for approval  before presenting it to the parliament, the paper lists five  kinds of taxes to be levied by the state.    The lowest personal income tax is 10 percent and the highest  is 30 percent.    The rate of the construction permit duties to be applied  preliminarily on three big cities -- Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and  Sihanoukville -- is 30 percent.    The rate of corporate benefit tax is 20 percent.    Land taxes are divided into:    1. Tax on land -- 2 percent for the first year, 4 percent  for second year, and 10 percent for the fifth year;    2. Tax on the gains in land values -- 10 to 30 percent for  individuals and 20 percent for corporations;    3. Capital tax -- at the rate of 2 to 3 percent of the  market prices imposed on the third extra house and up of  city-dwelling individuals.    Every contract on land lease and monthly house rent needs to  be approved by the Customs Department. The registration fee is  1 percent of the cost of the land lease or monthly house rent.    In another report on cargo loading and unloading at Phnom  Penh port, the paper cites a port official as saying that after  the government implemented its policy of a market-oriented  economy, the work in the 1993-94 period has improved. He added  that due to a protracted war and since security has not yet been  thoroughly ensured, the present volume of goods passing through  the port is only 2 to 3 percent of the total 6,184,000 tons in  the 1960-70 period. The amount of goods loaded and unloaded at  the port between 1979 and 1993 is 1,870,503 tons.</p>

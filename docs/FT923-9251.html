			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Olympics in Brief: American fails drug test Jud Logan, a surprise fourth-place finisher in the hammer, tested positive for a steroid and became the first American for 20 years to fail a drug test at the Games, the IOC said. Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the IOC medical commission, said traces of Clenbuterol were found in Logan's sample. De Merode said the second part of the sample had been tested but those results weren't immediately known. No action will be taken by the IOC until both test results are known. Earlier women's sprint champion Gail Devers denied using performance-enhancing drugs and called for disciplinary action against fellow-American Gwen Torrence for alleging that three competitors in the 100m final were doped.</p>

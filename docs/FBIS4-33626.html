			<p>BFN     [Text] President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide issued a  call at the OAS General Assembly for the international community  to take quick and decisive action to oust the military that  overthrew him in September 1991. Quick and decisive action is  needed to dislodge those responsible for the coup d'etat in the  framework of the Governors Island Agreement, Jean-Bertrand  Aristide told the OAS General Assembly in Brazil. I will not  waste time describing this action since the international  community knows what it is, the president-in-exile said without  explicitly mentioning military intervention.    OAS international mediator Dante Caputo believes this crisis  can be solved peacefully and in a few weeks. He thinks we do  not face a whole year, stating that it would be necessary to  issue a diplomatic ultimatum to the military in Haiti. He  concluded, quote, we cannot condemn an armed intervention and  not do anything to avoid it, unquote.    Jean-Bertrand Aristide presented a government action program  to be executed on his return. First, the president-in-exile  asked for the immediate return of the UN mission in Haiti, the  UN mission provided for in the Governors Island Agreement. I  will return after the mission is sent and after an army and  police reform program is introduced, he said. Once the  government is restored, Jean-Bertrand Aristide also promises to  collaborate with the UN mission for six months, as indicated in  the Governors Island Agreement. At the same time, he expressed  his willingness to reconcile Haitians with themselves, including  the military. There will be reconciliation after democracy is  restored in Haiti, which means peace for all, respect for each  citizen, unity, and justice for all, he stated. The  president-in-exile also presented a development program  involving international aid. A country at work is a country at  peace, assured the president-in-exile, who invited the OAS  chancellors to meet in Haiti for the next OAS General Assembly.    Those were statements made by President-in-exile  Jean-Bertrand Aristide during the the 24th OAS General Assembly  on 6 June.</p>

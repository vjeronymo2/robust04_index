			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Letter: Costly delivery Sir, On Wednesday I took a letter to my local post office and to my amazement the clerk informed me that the charge for the recorded delivery letter which I handed to him had increased from 30p to 55p. Yet only last week I paid 30p] That is an increase of 83.3 per cent. I realise that the current inflationary rate does not include postal charges. Nevertheless, how on earth is the small businessman to survive? Or isn't he supposed to? H N Harrison, H Norman Harrison &amp; Co, 309 Chase Road, London N14</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 2/6/1994 -- "You, Gagauzians,  are part of a greater nation we are two branches of the same  tree," stated today Turkish President Suleyman Demirel,  addressing about 500 people from the districts densely inhabited  by Gagauzians who gathered in "Druzhba" cinema in Comrat to take  part in the meeting with the Moldovan and Turkish presidents.  "I am grateful that you have maintained yourselves as a nation,  and thanks to Moldovan leadership we have met as a mother with  her son," said Demirel. He sent the regards of the Turkish  people and mentioned that Turkey will continue to cooperate with  Moldova to assist all ethnic groups. "I hope that the Gagauz  people will really appreciate this historical act and our common  efforts." Demirel appealed to the people: "Gagauz brothers, do  not confine yourselves in your own shell. By supporting  Moldova's territorial integrity, for which you voted on 6 March,  you acquired the support of Turkey and many countries. The  Moldovan leadership offers you possibilities for development.  Do not forget this and do not forget the international right  that must be above all other rights. Be correct and analyze the  essence of things, because dialogue and only dialogue will help  you." In Demirel's opinion Gagauzians must be a bridge of  friendship between Turkey and Moldova. Stepan Topal president  of the self-proclaimed Gagauz Republic expressed gratitude to  Presidents Snegur and Demirel for the possibility offered to  Gagauzians to develop their culture traditions and for  contributing to the Gagauzians national rebirth. "I am grateful  to the current Moldovan leadership for its willingness to grant  the `Gagauz-Eri- Gagauzia' special juridical status to  Gagauzians. The fact that a representative of the Council of  Europe called Moldova `a country of wisdom' proves this," said  Topal. He stated that this project will be presented to the  Moldovan Parliament to be confirmed. This way of settling  ethnic problems could serve an example for other regions.  Snegur pointed out that Chisinau officials are aware that  Gagauzians have much in common with the Turkish people who  support them spiritually and financially in their national  rebirth. This has become possible only after Moldova declared  its sovereignty said Snegur. "Gagauzian is studied now in  Southern Moldova in 48 schools and Comrat university and  college, it can be heard on the Moldovan Television and Radio  and local television and radio stations. The current Moldovan  leadership supports Gagauzians' aspirations to develop their  culture and traditions. The `Gagauz-Eri-Gagauzia' project was  recently finalized. It will open new prospects in this regard.  Moldovan republican organs grant the districts densely  inhabited by Gagauzians much empowerment." The friendship and  cooperation agreement to be signed tomorrow by Moldovan and  Turkish presidents, will consolidate the relations between the  two countries, the development of democracy and support the  rebirth of national minorities, mentioned Snegur. He mentioned  that Turkey will grant Moldova credit worth $35 million to be  invested in the development of the Southern Moldovan districts.    Dionisie Tanasoglo, rector of Comrat University handed  President Suleyman Demirel diploma of honorary doctorate. The  Turkish President said that Comrat University will be the 59th  university alongside 57 in Turkey and one in Middle Asia, where  Turkish is studied. The visit in Comrat continued with the  laying of the first stones of the foundation of the  Moldovan-Turkish tile and brick factory. The president also  attended an exhibition of Gagauz craftsmanship and a concert, in  the afternoon the members of the delegation held a series of  meetings in the villages of the Ciadar-Lunga district.</p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / An alliance that seeks strength in numbers: Michael Smith examines plans to create the UK's largest union through a merger of three public service organisations When Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe chose to stay on as leader of Nupe, the UK's fifth-largest union, some of his fellow trade unionists found the decision puzzling. They believed he was the ideal candidate for the post of general-secretary of the Trades Union Congress, representing almost 10m workers. Since that decision back in 1984, events have moved in Mr Bickerstaffe's direction and, at a time when membership of TUC-affiliated unions is declining - to less than 8m now - he could soon wield more influence than Mr Norman Willis, the man who became TUC leader. After a series of votes at union annual conferences over the past month, Nupe is almost certain to join with fellow public service unions Nalgo and Cohse to form Unison, a TUC-affiliated organisation with 1.5m members. From its formation in July next year, it would be Britain's largest union and the second biggest for public service workers in Europe. It will represent workers in the gas, electricity, water, transport and further education sectors, but its main areas of influence will be local government and health. For the first two years, Mr Bickerstaffe will share the leadership with Mr Alan Jinkinson of Nalgo and Hector Mackenzie of Cohse. After that Mr Bickerstaffe is almost certain to take sole control as general-secretary. While Mr Bickerstaffe's election would be welcomed by many colleagues, who see him as an effective advocate of trade unionism, the consequences of the merger will affect more than Mr Bickerstaffe and Unison members. The grouping of three unions into one would hasten the trend in Britain towards a smaller number of larger unions. Of wider importance still will be the effect of the amalgamation on the employers which currently deal with the three constituent unions. The union's creation comes at a time when the government is pressing public sector employers - local councils and the National Health Service - to devolve power to local managers. It wants local pay bargaining to replace existing national bargaining structures; performance-related pay significantly extended from managers to workers; and more services, particularly those in white-collar areas such as housing management and planning, to be put out to competitive tender to allow private-sector organisations to run them more efficiently. Where health and local government employers push through such changes, the unions, under their present fragmented structure, will be relatively powerless to resist. They believe the merger will result in one organisation speaking with a single voice and thus with a better chance of fighting what they see as the worst effects of reform. The contracting out of services, for instance, has cost thousands of local authority jobs. The merger should also increase the ability of union leaders to co-ordinate the action of their members, particularly in local government. Councils have been able to exploit a lack of common interest between white-collar staff, represented mainly by Nalgo, and manual workers, mostly in Nupe. Last year, as Nalgo was balloting its members over a strike on a 6.4 per cent pay offer, local authorities reached agreement with leaders of Nupe and other unions representing blue-collar workers on a similar offer, sweetened by a promise of shorter working hours. The proposed pay deal was believed to have weakened the resolve of white-collar staff, who voted against taking action over the offer. 'Divide and rule tactics like that will be less easy in the new set-up,' says one employer. 'It will be the same union negotiating for both blue and white-collar workers.' But not all employers are pessimistic about the proposed merger. Mr Charles Nolda, lead negotiator for UK local authorities in national pay talks, says the unions are likely to be 'forced to come to terms with the case for fundamental reform' in pay bargaining as a result of competitive tendering and of the growing number of councils opting out of national arrangements. The merger could hasten any rethink. In the past Nalgo in particular has opposed most attempts to add local flexibility to national pay negotiations, and in 1989 staged a series of nationwide strikes that succeeded in resisting the abolition of national pay grades. Nupe has been more amenable to change partly because its members have faced competition for jobs from lower-paid private sector workers. Employers hope that Nupe's pragmatic approach will have a strong influence in the new union. They also hope the merger will lead to 'single-table' bargaining for all workers below executive level. This would enable the current system of separate pay talks for white-collar, blue-collar and craft workers in local authorities to be replaced by one negotiating forum, thereby simplifying procedures. Similar arguments in favour of Unison are promoted by health service employers. They applaud the trend towards local bargaining and 'single-table' bargaining, and say the setting up of the merged union should speed these developments. However, few health trusts are likely to follow the example of Northumbria Ambulance service, which this year withdrew recognition from three unions so that it could negotiate solely with the Association of Professional Ambulance Personnel. Like employers, unions have mixed feelings about the creation of Unison. Some will benefit from increased membership, as workers unenthus-iastic about the merger resign. Others, particularly the TGWU general workers, will be concerned that the formation of such a large union will eclipse their own organisations. For more than 60 years, the TGWU has enjoyed the influence of being Britain's largest union, and many of its officials are unhappy at the prospect of losing that distinction. Over the past six months, the TGWU has buried its traditional enmity with the GMB general workers; many within both unions believe that a merger will eventually take place between them. If that happens, Mr John Edmonds, GMB general-secretary, may view his prediction that there would be four or five dominant unions by the end of the century as an over-estimate. Three or four might be more accurate: Unison and the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union (formed earlier this year) are certainties, with a question-mark hanging over the TGWU-GMB merger. Although some specialist unions such as the Fire Brigade Union and the Association of First Division Civil Servants could, and probably will, survive as independents, most others would be forced to seek refuge in alliances as their memberships decline and funds dwindle. Though there would still be a need for the TUC to lobby the government, many trade union leaders foresee a smaller organisation than exists today. In such circumstances, Mr Bickerstaffe's job judgment of eight years ago looks increasingly sensible.</p>

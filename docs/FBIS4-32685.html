			<p>BFN     [Text] The Democratic Party of Serbia [Depos] held a  regular news conference today. Party President Vojislav  Kostunica spoke about the work of the Serbian Government in the  last three months and the peace negotiations on the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Katarina Andric-Milosavljevic reports:    [Andric-Milosavljevic] The Democratic Party of Serbia holds  the view that the public has been presented a distorted picture  on the work of the Serbian Government in the past 100 days. The  assessments presented by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic  and Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic yesterday differ from those  that had been heard in the Serbian Assembly in the past few  months, Kostunica said. While the president and the prime  minister spoke about very successful work of the Serbian  Government, the Serbian Assembly often has long debates and  often hears certain politicians' sharp criticisms regarding the  lack of efficiency in the implementation of the Serbian  Government's measures, Vojislav Kostunica said.    The Democratic Party of Serbia takes the view that offered  solution for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, according to which  the Muslims would get 51 and the Serbs 49 percent of the  territory, conceals many shortcomings for the Serbs. This stems  from the fact that before the war the Serbs in  Bosnia-Herzegovina owned over 60 percent of territory and were  in an absolute majority, territorially and population wise. The  new division, giving a slight advantage to the Muslim side,  appears to be an attempt to make an entity whose advantage would  be extended in the future to numerous institutions that will  serve the Muslim and Croatian sides.    Despite this, the Serbs must insist on the continuation of  the peace negotiations in order to obtain a more favorable  solution, officials of the Democratic Party of Serbia say.</p>

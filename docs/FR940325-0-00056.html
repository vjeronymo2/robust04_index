The Commission declined to require that Mtel pay for its license, stated that Mtel's license application will be processed in due course, and affirmed Mtel's pioneer grant for a nationwide channel. For the license that Mtel may receive as a pioneer, the Commission required Mtel to build a system that substantially uses the design and technologies upon which its preference award was based and to hold its license for at least three years or until the five-year construction benchmark is met, whichever occurs first.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Additionally, Advanced Cordless Technologies, Inc. (ACT), Echo Group L.P. (Echo), Freeman Engineering Associates, Inc. (Freeman), and Global Enhanced Messaging Venture (Global) requested reconsideration of the denial of their pioneer's preference requests. ACT's petition was dismissed as untimely filed. Echo's petition was denied because: (1) The two-way data service it proposed was initially designed for implementation in services in which its use already is authorized; (2) Echo did not demonstrate how its proposal differs from existing or proposed two-way data services on cellular or land mobile frequencies; (3) Echo did not demonstrate with specificity the developments for which it is responsible; and (4) Echo did not explain how it derives its cost figures. Freeman's petition was denied because its system is incompatible with the licensing rules. Global's petition was denied because its system does not qualify as innovative under the Commission's rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Accordingly, it is ordered that part 99 of the Commission's rules is amended as specified below, effective April 25, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. It is further ordered that the petitions for clarification or reconsideration filed by Mobile Telecommunication Technologies, Inc., Paging Network, Inc., and PageMart, Inc. are granted in part as discussed  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and ARE DENIED in all other respects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. It is further ordered that the petitions for reconsideration filed by Echo Group L.P., Freeman Engineering Associates, Inc., and Global Enhanced Messaging Venture ARE DENIED and that the petition for reconsideration filed by Advanced Cordless Technologies, Inc. is dismissed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. It is further ordered that the licensing bureau shall impose the following conditions on the license received by Mobile Telecommunication Technologies, Inc. (Mtel) pursuant to its pioneer's preference award: (1) Mtel shall be required to build a system that substantially uses the design and technologies upon which its preference award was based; and (2) Mtel must hold its license for three years or until the construction requirements applicable to the five-year build-out period specified in &sect;99.103 of the Commission's rules have been satisfied, whichever occurs first. It is further ordered that the petitions filed by Pacific Bell, Paging Network, Inc., and PageMart, Inc. addressing Mtel's pioneer's preference award are granted to this extent and, in all other respects, are denied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13.

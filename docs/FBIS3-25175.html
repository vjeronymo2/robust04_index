			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lagos, Feb 8 (AFP) -- Nigeria's Campaign for  Democracy (CD), grouping scores of human rights and student  organisations, pledged its commitment Tuesday [8 February] to an  "intensified struggle" to bring down the military regime.    The CD, which was in the forefront of a campaign last year  for recognition of the results of June 12 civilian presidential  elections annulled by the army, said it would work for "the  immediate termination of the Abacha dictatorship."    In a statement released here after a national convention of  the Campaign last week in Ibadan, north of Lagos, the movement  "condemned in the strongest terms possible the unwanted and  unwelcome coup of General Sani Abacha of November 17, 1993."  Abacha ousted an unelected, short-lived civilian interregnum "at  a time when what the majority of Nigerians desired was the  upholding of the June 12 election adjuged the fairest and freest  in the nation's history."    The CD convention called for the "immediate" setting up of a  national government including "popular and credible  representatives of various social, professional and ethnic  groups" in Africa's most populous nation, which has some 89  million inhabitants.    The CD, whose convention brought together 120 delegates from  70 movements working for democracy, is essentially based in the  Yoruba southwest of the country, the home base of the Moslem  millionaire believed to have won the poll last June, Moshood  Abiola.    Its statement "decried the slavish, easy and unprecedented  capitulation of the political elite...to the Abacha regime,"  blaming members of both Abiola's left-leaning Social Democratic  Party and the rival National Republican Convention. "This was  demonstrated by their failure to resist the dissolution of all  democratic structures," including the federal parliament and the  two political parties themselves, by Abacha on his seizure of  power, the CD said.    Politicians had nevertheless chosen "to embrace it (the  regime) by grabbing appointments at the state and federal levels  without regard to the aspirations of their (party) members and  the socio-political destiny of Nigerians in general." On  seizing power with a pledge eventually to restore civilian rule,  Abacha managed to enlist a number of prominent Abiola supporters  into his governing team.    The CD said the "main agenda" of the new government it  wanted  should be to prepare for a "Sovereign National Conference (SNC)  that shall deliberate on all national issues it deems fit  without any derogation or interference whatsoever by the  government." The conference should devise a new "popular"  transition programme to bring about a "genuinely democratic  order through free and fair multiparty elections."    Then military ruler General Ibrahim Babangida annulled the  June 12 poll alleging irregularities, though international  observers had billed it a clean race, and plunged Nigeria into  turmoil after its latest decade of military rule.</p>

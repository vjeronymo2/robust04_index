Smoothing  this over fell to SCR receptionist Holly Van Holt and her volunteers, who are  applying 10,000 gold stickers to programs to credit the bank. "I'm only on the  thousandth sticker," she said. "I'm not even close."  </P> <P> </P> <P> CASH FOR THE ARTS  </P> <P> Where donations -- public and private -- go in Orange County  </P> <P> Dance: 2%  </P> <P> Music: 10%  </P> <P> Museums: 10%  </P> <P> Theater: 19%  </P> <P> Presenters*: 59%  </P> <P> * such as O.C.

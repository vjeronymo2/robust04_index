			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KARPOV, KASPAROV TO PLAY CHESS REMATCH  </P> <P> Former world champion Anatoly Karpov won the World Candidates chess final  Monday by beating Jan Timman of the Netherlands and earned the right to a world  championship rematch with fellow Soviet Gary Kasparov.  </P> <P> The $3-million championship match, the fifth between the archrival grandmasters  in six years, will open in New York in October.  </P> <P> Timman resigned after 56 moves in the ninth game, giving Karpov the victory, 6  1/2-2 1/2. Grandmasters and chess experts said it was the best game of the  tournament.  </P> <P> "I didn't expect to win so easily," said Karpov, who earned the lion's share of  the $250,000 prize.  </P> <P> Timman said he thought that he played a good game but made a crucial mistake on  move 39 when he played bishop to queen two. "I should have taken Karpov's king  pawn," he said dejectedly.  </P> <P> Timman said he feared defeat after losing the fourth game.  </P> <P> "I felt that was my best game and didn't think I could win after losing it," he  told reporters.  </P></p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / IBES forecasts upturn in profits STOCK MARKET analysts have again cut their profits forecasts for 1992 for companies in the seven leading economies, according to the IBES research service, based in New York. The IBES survey was carried out at the end of March by adding together thousands of individual company earnings forecasts from analysts around the world. Initial estimates from analysts are often over-optimistic, and downwards revisions are common. The biggest drop came in Japan and the UK, where profits forecasts have been revised downwards since December by 9 per cent. The downward revision for Canada was 7 per cent; for France and the US, 5 per cent; for Italy 3 per cent; and Germany 2 per cent. However, in most countries, 1992 is still forecast to show a strong earnings upturn from a poor 1991. As the table shows, earnings growth of well above 20 per cent is forecast in Canada, the UK and the US. Only Japan is expected to show a drop in earnings, of 11 per cent, in the year that ends in March 1993. The lower earnings figures apparently left the markets unaffected: at the end of March price-earnings ratios based on forecast 1992 earnings were higher or unchanged compared with the end of December in every country but Japan. The Japanese p/e is calculated using earnings figures to March 1993. A higher p/e ratio is usually taken to mean that stock prices are more 'expensive' than they were.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CONSENSUS ESTIMATES FOR EARNINGS GROWTH  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               EPS Growth %          P/E 1992                              *1992     1993       Dec      Mar Canada - TSE                  58.4     34.3        15       16 France - CAC 40               19.8     12.6        11       12 Germany - Dax                  5.6     19.3        13       14 Italy - BCI                   13.4      6.6        14       14 Japan - Nikkei                -1.2       na        38       36 UK - FTSE                     24.8     15.1        12       12 US - S&amp;P 500                  26.7     21.4        15       15  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * As at end-Mar 1992.

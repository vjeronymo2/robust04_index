Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> PANORAMA CITY COMPUTER HACKER PLEADS GUILTY TO FELONY COUNTS  </P> <P> A computer hacker from Panorama City, who was considered such a danger that  prison guards supervised his phone calls to prevent him from accessing  computers, pleaded guilty today to two felony counts that could imprison him  for a year.  </P> <P> Kevin Mitnick pleaded guilty to one count of possessing 16 unauthorized  long-distance telephone codes and one count of computer fraud for gaining  access to a Massachusetts computer company's system and stealing a security  program. Mitnick, 25, will be imprisoned for 12 months and subjected to  intensive supervision for three years after his release if the agreement is  approved by U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer. She scheduled sentencing for  April 24.  </P> <P> When Mitnick was arrested, prosecutors insisted he posed such a threat to  national computer security that he must be held without bail. Prison guards  have been dialing the phone for him so he does not access computers.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVE DISTEL: LITTLE MONEY FOR THE FIRST MILE, LESS FOR EACH ADDITIONAL MILE  </P> <P> Baseball's statistical nuts, and I confess that I may be one of them, are  constantly coming up with new numerical twists on the grand old game.  </P> <P> The latest, which popped into the computer system one afternoon this week, was  a study by a University of Dayton economics professor. This one has to do with  dollar signs rather than decimal points.  </P> <P> Lawrence Hadley analyzed statistics as they relate to salaries and concluded  that home runs are worth $4,283 per swat, hits $1,322 for even the softest  broken bat bloop single and stolen bases $713 each, indicating maybe crime  really doesn't pay.  </P> <P> I thought of these numbers later that same afternoon when I was sitting on top  of a picnic table on the shores of Mission Bay with a sweating fellow named  Steve McCormack. I thought also that I would not mention that baseball players  earn $4,283 for trotting 360 feet or $713 for dashing 90 feet.  </P> <P> McCormack, you see, is a runner.  </P> <P> What's more, he's a darn good one.  </P> <P> A friend of mine, Ron Heifner, had brought him to my attention over the  weekend. Heifner is also a runner, though he has dedicated his running career  thus far to finding a field small enough or old enough for him to beat.  </P> <P> McCormack impressed him in the YMCA Breakers 10-Mile Run Saturday at Mission  Bay.  </P> <P> "This guy," Heifner said, "has a wife and two kids and works full time and  still runs 100 miles a week. Then he goes out and runs 10 miles in 51:04 on the  sand. He's got to be a good story."  </P> <P> McCormack, who first attracted attention hereabouts while at Grossmont College,  would be a good story. Thousands of San Diegans run and jog, but he has been  one of the most prominent for quite some time. I figured he has probably  parlayed this success to a comfortable home, maybe in Rancho Santa Fe, and a  jet-setting life style going from one race or another in places such as Hawaii  and Switzerland. No way this guy would need a full-time job.  </P> <P> I expected McCormack to show up for the interview looking like one of those  Indy racers, wearing so many sponsors' patches you wonder how they can move. I  expected him to have an agent and maybe a publicist.  </P> <P> He showed up wearing a nondescript T-shirt and plain sweat pants. Obviously,  his sponsors would not be pleased.  </P> <P> Your sponsors, Mac, what about your sponsors?  </P> <P> "Big zip," he said.  </P> <P> What?  </P> <P> "If you're not running at an Olympic level, such as guys like Steve Scott,  you're not making any money," he said. "The shoe companies, the mainstays of  distance running, are cutting everybody out. It's not just me. I could give you  name after name after name."  </P> <P> And so McCormack really is working a 40-hour week?  </P> <P> Indeed, he is liquor manager for a Clairemont drug store. He is a working  stiff, a running fool and a husband and father. His wife, Theresa, a senior  claims adjuster for an insurance company, jogs along -- not at her husband's  pace, obviously -- with the two toddlers in a stroller. This family is on the  move.  </P> <P> However, paydays are hard to come by these days, at least payoffs for winning  races are hard to come by.  </P> <P> "Mac has to look all over the place trying to find races that'll pay 100, 200  or 300 bucks," said Jon Haberkern, a running partner who was suddenly sounding  like the agent I expected McCormack to have. "The sponsors take care of the  milers and the marathoners, but nothing in between."  </P> <P> That's where McCormack lives and runs, in between the traditional glamour of  the mile and the growing clamor for the marathon. He specializes in the 10K  (6.2 miles) up to the half-marathon (13.1 miles). The big money does not rain  on his parades.  </P> <P> He knows he does not have the speed for the mile, and the marathon presents  problems in terms of preparation and after-effects. He would have to work less  and run more and sacrifice the $100 to $300 races that help put bread and  margarine on the table. That is risky business, because it involves a six-month  investment that can go crashing into that proverbial wall at the 20-mile mark.  </P> <P> "I've had a history of blowing up after 18 to 20 miles," McCormack said. "I  know I've got a good marathon in me, but I don't know if I can bring it out."  </P> <P> And so he keeps on going, running's version of a guy who does what he does with  the very best at a time when the big bucks are being spent on something (or  someone) else.  </P> <P> Why keep running?  </P> <P> "It's kind of like being addicted to drugs," he said. "I can't stop. I do it  regardless of the money. If I was in this for the money, I'd be in it for the  wrong reasons."  </P> <P> But it seems that 10 fast miles on the sand from a guy doing all that work and  running all that fast should be worth at least a single. Right professor?  </P></p>

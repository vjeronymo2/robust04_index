			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> POINT / COUNTERPOINT : DEBATING DRUG BARRICADES: REMOVING RIGHTS OR PROVIDING  PROTECTION?  </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Fed up with a steady stream of drive-by drug buyers in residential  neighborhoods, police have barricaded a 20-square-block area in Sepulveda to  deter narcotics traffic.  </P> <P> No organized opposition has surfaced to the concept, which reportedly is the  first such effort on a large scale in the nation. Since November, when police  first set up wooden sawhorses around a Pico-Union neighborhood, at least three  more neighborhoods have been barricaded in other parts of the city: Sepulveda,  South-Central Los Angeles and Koreatown.  </P> <P> FOR  </P> <P> JOEL WACHS  </P> <P> Joel Wachs, 50, has been a member of the Los Angeles City Council for the past  19 years. He represents the Sepulveda neighborhood where barriers have been  installed and says they have curtailed drive-by drug traffic and should be  erected anywhere police and residents think they are necessary.  </P> <P> Q. What evidence is there that the barricades work?  </P> <P> A. There are four ways to judge it. You can judge it by police crime  statistics, which show a substantial drop in drug-dealing and related crimes  since the barricades were erected.  </P> <P> The second indication, which is the most significant, is the impact on the  residents. Everyone that I have heard from both directly and from media  accounts feel it has had a tremendous positive impact. They see less crime,  they feel infinitely safer walking in the area. They feel like the area has  been given back to them.  </P> <P> Third, as an outside observer, I have driven through those areas, and there are  not the kind of blatant drug dealings on the street. There are far fewer people  just sort of congregating and milling about.  </P> <P> The fourth thing is that it has actually lessened the need for intense police  manpower in the immediate area and freed the officers to police other areas.  Ironically, it's turned out to be very cost-effective.  </P> <P> Q. Signs posted in one of the two barricaded neighborhoods say: "Secure Area --  Residents Only." Isn't this restriction a violation of the civil rights of  those who merely wish to visit the neighborhood?  </P> <P> A. Legally, they can go in and no one will stop them. The only way you can  legally restrict them from going in is by withdrawing the streets from public  use, which we have not done.  </P> <P> It's too soon to tell if it will be necessary to remove the streets from public  use and restrict entry.  </P> <P> Right now, it's like having a sign on your house that says "Beware of Dog," but  you don't really have a dog. It sends a message. I'm open to changing the  wording of the signs, but I have yet to hear of one example of someone who had  a lawful purpose to go in there that was denied entrance. Obviously, we don't  get calls from drug buyers complaining about not being able to go in and buy  drugs.  </P> <P> Q. Won't the barricades simply drive drug dealers into adjacent areas or into  some of the San Fernando Valley's other 30 or so drug hot spots?  </P> <P> A. We have yet to see a spillover from the entire 20-square-block area into  nearby neighborhoods because there's the natural barrier of the San Diego  Freeway to the west and single-family homes in the other directions. The hope  is there will be a scatter effect and the dealers will not be able to establish  themselves in new areas because the police will be on the lookout for them.  </P> <P> I don't know if there has been an increase of drug activity in the other hot  spots. I would have to find out. I haven't heard of it, but I'm not saying yes  or no because I don't know.  </P> <P> Q. Should we try this technique in other Valley neighborhoods beset by drive-by  drug buyers?  </P> <P> A. We may. It doesn't bother me one bit if the result is working with the  residents to liberate neighborhoods in the way that we have liberated this one.  </P> <P> Q. Critics blast the barricades as analogous to the Berlin Wall. Are they?  </P> <P> A. I get really angry when someone uses that analogy because it's a cheap shot.  The Berlin Wall was a government putting up a wall to restrict the freedom of  its citizens. This is a government working with its people to put up a barrier  for the protection of the people.  </P> <P> Societies from the beginning put up barriers to keep invaders out, to keep  people safe. You had walled cities. Today, people have security measures in  their homes, and this is the same thing.  </P> <P> Q. Does this preserve neighborhoods or stigmatize them?  </P> <P> A. The long-term result of this is that it preserves the neighborhood and makes  it much safer. So, in the long run, it does make it a more desirable place to  live. It is true that it does call attention to the fact that there are  problems there. But I'd rather get the problems out in the open and get rid of  them so that in the end you've got an area that has got a great reputation,  rather than one that has continually festering, underlying problems.  </P> <P> Q. What happens when you take the barricades away? Isn't there a chance that  the problem will return?  </P> <P> A. We'll just have to wait and see. It's not uncommon in war, and we are in a  drug war, to keep adjusting your strategies. For instance, we could put the  barricades back if the drug traffic returned. The point is that what you have  here is a police captain and a councilman and a neighborhood saying, "We're not  going to let up on this. We're going to do what the situation demands and  respond accordingly to keep this area a safe haven."  </P> <P> We're not saying this is the magic solution or professing that it will solve  the drug problem. But you don't ignore a problem because you don't have the  total solution. Let the critics come up with the magic answer. I'd be happy to  hear it.  </P></p>

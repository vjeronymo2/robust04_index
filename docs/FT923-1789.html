			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The Economic Fallout: Stability of currencies a priority - Ministers at Group of Seven and IMF meetings ready to restore calm in markets FINANCE MINISTERS from the world's leading industrial nations were last night preparing to restore calm in case of financial market turbulence following the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty. A weekend meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers agreed to take 'appropriate additional actions as needed' to achieve currency stability. European Community finance ministers said yesterday they were ready to bring Japan, the US and Canada (which together with Germany, France, the UK and Italy make up the G7) into their discussions if necessary, but said responsibility for reacting to the French vote lay primarily with the Europeans. Their remarks came after a meeting of finance ministers yesterday called by Mr Norman Lamont, the British chancellor of the exchequer, in his capacity as president of the EC finance ministers' council. It remained unclear what additional moves had been agreed. The G7 communique said the ministers and central bank governors expressed concern about the recent volatility in world markets and agreed on the importance of restoring stable relationships. They said they would 'continue to co-operate and to monitor closely economic and financial conditions in their countries' and act as needed 'to achieve sustained growth and greater currency stability'. The ministers' promise of additional action provoked scepticism among some bankers in Washington. Mr Wolfgang Roller, chief executive of Dresdner Bank, said it was difficult to imagine anything that could be effective, given the size of foreign exchange markets. With ministers aware that a public display of disagreement could further upset financial markets, the G7 meeting was unusually harmonious. 'No one was put in the dock,' said Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister. Mr Lamont went out of his way afterwards to say that he was not criticising Germany. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, said he did not come under pressure to cut interest rates. Some of the tensions underlying economic relations among the countries surfaced away from the G7 meeting. It is understood that in bilateral talks with Mr Waigel, Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, repeated the US belief that Germany should cut its interest rates to promote growth in Europe.</p>

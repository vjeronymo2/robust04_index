			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading Enthusiasm within the futures market caught the underlying stock market by surprise yesterday and was largely responsible for forcing stock prices higher ahead of today's budget, writes Peter John. The cash market showed no desire, on the first day of the new trading account, to move forward from Friday's close. But the FT-SE futures contract expiring in December jumped 10 points at the start of trading and surged forward to a high of 3,167 to set the agenda in London markets. Marketmakers said the contract was 'very squeezy' as there was still quite a big shortage of stock following the surprise turnaround prompted by last week's base rate cut. At its best the December contract was 23 points above cash, a startling premium considering that the estimated fair value - the premium that takes into account the cost of carrying less dividend payments - is actually at a small discount to cash for this account. By the official close at 4.10pm the December contract was slightly easier at 3,157 but still at a premium of 22 to cash with dealers anticipating good news from the Budget, particularly on advance corporation tax. Any decision not to cut back ACT would be of particular benefit to investment institutions such as insurance groups. Among stock options Prudential was the most heavily traded with turnover 3,663 lots although traders said the volume mainly reflected bitty technical trading. Glaxo, which is hosting a key R&amp;D presentation today, was the second big stock option with 1,748 contracts transacted.</p>

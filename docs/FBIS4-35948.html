			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 4 (AFP) -- Southern Yemeni forces  may ask Saudi Arabia to send troops to help fight rival northern  forces, the appointed vice president of the breakaway southern  state told AFP Saturday [4 June].    'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri said southern leaders had "not yet  decided" whether to ask for Saudi intervention in the month-long  war, but added "everything is possible and legitimate to protect  our people".    He spoke as northern troops loyal to President 'Ali  'Abdallah  Salih edged closer to the south's bastion of Aden, capital of  the self-declared Yemen Democratic Republic.    Al-Jifri was commenting on reports of reinforcements to the  Saudi military presence on its border with the former South  Yemen, which united with North Yemen four years ago.    He said the reinforcements were not a Saudi intervention but  "a precaution that any state would take in the event of war in  its neighbouring state."    Al-Jifri said: "I am sure that Saudi Arabia would not  intervene unless it was asked to by somebody," adding such a  request would be "internationally legitimate."    Southern forces loyal to the president's rival 'Ali Salim  al-Bid, who declared the breakaway republic on May 21, have  accepted UN Security Council Resolution 924 calling for an  immediate ceasefire in the civil war.    Northern forces, now within 15 kilometers (nine miles) of  Aden, have also said they are prepared to accept the UN  resolution.    Saudi Arabia, which initiated the UN resolution along with  other Gulf states, has denied northern charges that it is siding  with the south in the war.    Saudi's King Fahd has urged north and south Yemen to  implement the UN Security Council's call for a ceasefire.    "If the north and the south accept UN Security Council  Resolution 924, it will be a good initiative and one that should  lead to a definitive halt to the fighting," he said in an  interview broadcast late Friday on the London-based Arabic  television station MBC.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / DTI closes tour operator The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday closed WorldWide Theme Travel, a tour operator that traded as WTT Flights and Leisure. The company, based in the City of London, was expelled from the Association of British Travel Agents last year. It specialised in travel to Spain, Portugal and Malta. Customers now abroad will be able to continue their holidays and passengers planning to fly abroad after midnight tomorrow will be given refunds, the Civil Aviation Authority said. Mr Keith Betton, Abta's head of corporate affairs, said it had received hundreds of complaints from customers alleging irregular withdrawals from credit cards, refunds which never arrived and pressure selling. 'They were a company that brought our industry and our association into disrepute and we were not prepared for them to remain in membership any longer,' he said.</p>

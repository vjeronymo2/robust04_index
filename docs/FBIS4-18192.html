			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur: "For a </F> Stability Pact in Europe"]    [Text] In 1989, Europe was suddenly inspired by a great  hope of freedom, democracy, and social progress. Our now  reunified continent had to face an exhilarating challenge.  Opening up before it was the chance to overcome historical  divisions and to return to the forefront of the international  stage.    In three years, our hopes faded. The transition in the East  proved more difficult and more expensive than had been foreseen,  the economic crisis caused unemployment to rise, and the drama  in the former Yugoslavia reminded everyone how difficult it is  to assume the heritage of history. Confidence in the future  gave way to concern. Today, it is up to Europe's leaders to  react against this wave of pessimism and to restore confidence  to our continent.    This is why, as soon as I took office in April 1993, I  proposed to organize negotiations with a view to adopting a  stability pact in Europe. Its main aim is to put into practice  the major principles which all the countries of the European  continent have accepted for many years, notably by signing the  Paris Charter of the CSCE.    Today, everyone recognizes the territorial integrity of  states and the inviolability of borders, everyone recognizes the  right of each individual, even if a member of a minority, to  benefit from universal human rights.    Many institutions, such as the CSCE or the Council of  Europe,  play a remarkable role in ensuring that these rights are  respected. But everybody also knows that, in our Europe marked  by a long and troubled history and, as a result, by wars and  population movements, questions and uncertainties still remain.  The continent of Europe must put these problems of minorities  and of borders behind it, once and for all.    The time is opportune as, thanks to the wisdom and  moderation  of many governments, these difficulties are now contained. But  what would happen if a crisis flared up tomorrow, caused by  whatever economic or social circumstance?  <H5>  Project Launch on 26 and 27 May </H5>   Good neighbor relations must therefore be established so  closely between the people of Central Europe that their borders  will never again be the subject of dispute. Respect for the  rights of individuals belonging to minority groups must be  perfectly guaranteed, so that these groups will automatically  accord their loyalty to the countries of which they are citizens.    It is time to demonstrate our confidence in the future and  to  show our political commitment in favor of stability in Europe.  I have proposed that the European Union (EU) and all those  countries which are interested in the stability of our  continent, and in particular the United States and Russia,  should offer the countries of Central and East Europe a  political framework within which to organize in the best  possible way relations between neighboring countries so that  problems of borders and of minorities shall never again arise.  This initiative was accepted at the European summit in Brussels  in December 1993. It is only natural for this to be the first  joint foreign policy and security action by the EU. It  demonstrates the will of the EU to place its economic strength  and stability in the service of the continent as a whole.    At the Copenhagen summit in July 1993, the Twelve decided to  open the door to the prospect of membership for the countries of  Central and East Europe. Everybody understands that this  enlargement will be made easier if the sources of instability  are no more, and our economic and political structures aligned.  Everybody also understands that this enlargement must also  involve the field of security.    This is the thinking behind the proposal made to countries  seeking to join the EU to create a status of associate member of  the WEU [Weestern European Union], in conformity with the EU  aims to avail itself of a joint defense and security policy.  The new organization of the continent of Europe that we are  seeking must extend to all aspects of our common life. We must  all work together on this, and as of now.    The conference to launch this stability pact project will be  held on 26 and 27 May. I believe this conference should be the  start of a diplomatic process, the need for which everybody is  now aware, to judge by the number of bilateral accords currently  being negotiated but which sometimes prove difficult to  successfully conclude. It must refocus attention on the  commitment of all the participating countries to the principal  existing texts and launch several tables of bilateral  negotiations, or of regional negotiations in order to deal with  the regional aspects of good neighborliness between these  countries.    It is not therefore a question of writing new texts, of  creating a new institution, and even less of seeking to replace  the free will of the interested countries. I believe that the  presence of moderators at these negotiating tables will serve to  reassure all parties, offering them support and, if possible,  the objectivity of a third party. These third parties could be  the EU, or an institution, or member countries, and France is  ready to lend its assistance to anyone who may request it.  Because the fact remains that the question of good  neighborliness often involves tackling matters of extreme  sensitivity in the area of domestic policy.  <H5>  A Signal of European Will </H5>   Everybody must therefore commit themselves to this process  with every assurance that justice will be respected. There will  no longer be large or small countries, but rather partners in a  common cause. The relations of the past 30 years between France  and Germany testify to the extraordinary results which bilateral  accords can achieve when inspired by strong political will and  when they create the appropriate procedures. Franco-German  consultations are so close and frequent at all levels of the  state and society that, for example, the border between the two  countries which was formerly so heavily emotionally and  symbolically charged has today become a symbol of rapprochement.    The accords which the parties will reach will be grouped  within a stability pact to be signed by all the participants at  the conference which will conclude this process. They will thus  be lending decisive support to the legitimacy of these accords.  The signatures of countries seeking to join the EU will be a  fundamental element in drawing closer to the EU.    Respect for these accords will guarantee harmonious progress  of the European enterprise. It may be supposed that the formal  nature of this pact will constitute in Europe a very strong and  significant signal in favor of stability. This signal will be  understood by all those who govern the economy, together with  all the other powers in the world who will see in it both  Europe's will to once again serve as an example for the respect  of the human values which were born in our continent, and an  area of progress for the people who live on European soil.</p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Optimism for new S Africa talks THE South African government and the African National Congress ended three days of talks yesterday with both sides saying they expected multi-party constitutional negotiations to begin again early next year. The talks, the first extended contact between the two sides since June, appear to have strengthened the good relations between them, but to have yielded few concrete agreements. In a joint statement, Pretoria and the ANC committed themselves to move speedily toward democracy, and to ensure that the Convention for a Democratic South Africa, which broke down last May, is reconvened in an enlarged form as soon as poss ible. The ANC expects talks in January. But the success of such talks will depend on whether Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and his mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party agree to take part. There was little sign yesterday that the government and the ANC had agreed on a strategy to persuade Chief Buthelezi to rejoin the talks, which he is boycotting. Indeed, the three-day talks, which were said to have been a 'social success', could well drive a further wedge between the government/ANC axis and Chief Buthelezi, who suspects his two rivals of forging an alliance against him. This impression will be strengthened by the wording of the cautious joint statement, which speaks of a 'shared responsibility to ensure that a multi-party negotiated transformation from the present situation to a democracy must take place rapidly'. The two sides appointed a sub-committee to continue the debate over ways to restart democracy talks and slow township violence, and said they would meet again for a full session in the second half of January. They discussed a timetable for the installation of an all-race interim government, but did not set a date, as demanded by Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC president. This evidence of common cause from the country's two main political groupings will lift the morale of whites, under severe pressure in recent days because of two terrorist attacks, both believed to have been carried out by the radical Pan Africanist Congress. On Thursday night, a restaurant bomb blast injured 19 whites, the second such attack in a week, sparking fears of a terrorist campaign against the white minority.</p>

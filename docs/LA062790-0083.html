			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TREND WATCH;  </P> <P> A ROUNDUP OF BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS SPOTTED BY OTHER PUBLICATIONS.  </P> <P> Room With View: New, cheaper technology is making video conferences more  attractive than travel, especially for intra-company meetings. The price of a  basic installation has been halved to about $50,000. Companies with private  video conference rooms include Texas Instruments, General Dynamics and Arco Oil  &amp; Gas. US Sprint and other companies rent teleconferencing rooms, enabling  small firms to use the technology without a capital investment. Dallas Business  Journal  </P> <P> Faring Well: Between the strike at Greyhound and high summer gas prices, record  numbers of Americans are riding the rails. Amtrak reports that ridership is up  12% over last year's 22 million, with scenic routes pulling in increases of 30%  and up. An Amtrak spokesman said that with more cars on its scenic routes,  Amtrak could triple its ridership in the summer. Denver Post  </P> <P> Swedish Bid: L. M. Ericsson Telephone Co. of Sweden, the world's fifth-largest  telecommunications equipment maker, is poised to compete for dominance of the  $80-billion global equipment market. Ericsson has developed pocket-sized  cordless phones in Europe and is spearheading development of a Europe-wide  technical telecommunications standard that is expected to be in place by 1992.  Lars Ramqvist, the company's new president, sees the joint venture with General  Electric -- Ericsson GE Mobile Communications of Paramus, N.J., as Ericsson's  base for competing in North America. Toronto Globe and Mail  </P> <P> Tinted Lenses: PPG Industries of Pittsburgh is joining France's Essilor  International to produce the first photochromic plastic eyeglass lens. PPG  spent $10 million to develop a plastic lens sensitive to light, a trait  previously available only with glass. About a quarter of all glass lenses are  photochromic, and most consumers are expected to prefer lenses in less weighty  plastic. St. Petersburg Times  </P> <P> Microwave Bread: With its joint venture with Nestle and an arrangement with  Gai's Seattle French Baking Co., General Mills is aggressively moving into new  territory. The goal of the Nestle cereal venture is to capture 20% of the  European market and $1 billion in sales by the end of the decade. The agreement  with Gai's will introduce what is said to be the first microwave bread line.  Betty Crocker Microwave Breads, six shelf-stable bread varieties, will debut in  Washington state.

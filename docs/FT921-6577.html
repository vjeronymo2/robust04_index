			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Book Review: When markets alone are not enough THE MORAL FOUNDATIONS OF MARKET INSTITUTIONS By John Gray Institute of Economic Affairs, Pounds 7.95 What should inspire post-Thatcher Conservatives - and their allies abroad? Autonomy, free markets, and an enabling welfare state, argues John Gray, an Oxford political theorist. In this powerful Institute of Economic Affairs tract, he combines all three to map out a plausible middle ground for political debate in the 1990s. With most of today's politicians - left, right and centre - desperately searching for such terrain, he is playing to a packed audience. Gray is that rare bird: the polemical moderate. The 'ruinous failure' of state socialism, the 'mirage' of egalitarianism, the 'blind alley' of market socialism, the 'illusions' of libertarianism - successive chapters shatter each in turn. Gray's political sympathies lie unambiguously with the right, but his strictures on the limits of markets and the importance of welfare will cause many an IEA patron to blanch. The promotion of human autonomy is, for Gray, the end of politics. But autonomy is more than freedom - the 'negative liberty' of classical liberals and conservatives. To be valuable, autonomy requires both capacities for choice on the part of the individual and a range of worthwhile options in his or her cultural environment. 'In the absence of this,' claims Gray, 'autonomy wanes, and the lives of individuals become the poorer, however many choices they make.' Accordingly, free markets are ethically justified as enabling devices for the protection and enhancement of autonomy - since without them, the ability of individuals to act upon their own goals, values and knowledge is diminished. But markets alone are not enough. If worthwhile choices are to be available to all, the state has to provide public goods for all. The state also has to satisfy the 'basic needs' of individuals through an active welfare and cultural policy - where markets, families, charities and other non-state institutions fail to do so. What are these 'basic needs'? They are needs whose satisfaction is essential to the possibility of a worthwhile life. For the most part, they are also capable of complete satiation. The latter feature is critical: for most basic needs, writes Gray, 'once they are met, the content of the welfare claim which guarantees their satisfaction is exhausted'. So needs, not rights or justice, justify the claims of individuals on the state. Hence the welfare state. But Gray's Leviathan is small and tame. It will supplement, not replace, private provision. It will consume only about a quarter of the national product, and not be a racket for the middle classes. It will deliver as far as possible through market mechanisms, using vouchers and the like. And its structure will conform to the principle of subsidiarity, 'with functions being devolved to the lowest feasible and desirable level of government'. None of this cuts much ice with the remnants of the Thatcherite right. In accompanying commentaries, Chandran Kukathas, of the University of New South Wales, and Patrick Minford, the monetarist economist, defend negative liberty - freedom from coercion - as a goal in its own right, and dismiss 'basic needs' as hard to define, and where defined, ruinously expensive to meet. Gray's response is persuasive. Freedom, he argues, has little value on its own. Its chief value is the contribution it makes to autonomy - an autonomy which involves far more than the mere absence of coercion by others. As for basic needs, they necessarily vary across cultures and societies - to lead a worthwhile life, the Kalahari bushman and the urban professional require different things. Yet allowing for that, and the impossibility of precise mathematical objectivity in such matters, a 'reasoned public discourse' ought to generate consensus on the content of such needs. Gray may place too much faith on the power of 'reasoned discourse': propose reducing state spending to a quarter of the national product, and the ensuing debate will be anything but reasoned. Beyond lauding subsidiarity - a difficult principle to apply, as the European Community is discovering painfully - he also has little to say about the organisation of his limited government. Yet the issue affects his argument at every turn, with constitutional reform moving up the agenda of Britain's political class through concern for just that autonomy which he is seeking to promote. A related caveat is entered by Raymond Plant, coming from the left in the third of the commentaries. It may indeed be possible to reach broad consensus on basic needs, but it is far from evident that such needs, taken together, can be met completely within available resources. Gray himself concedes the expense of many basic health needs - particularly those relating to ageing; and that is even before aggregating them with entitlements to education, training, housing, defence and so on. Yet if basic needs cannot be met completely, then a debate about distribution and fairness takes over - and the rules for conducting it become crucial. As Plant notes, governments all too often fall victim to interest group pressures in relation to the provision of basic services because of their unwillingness to face the fact of scarcity, and the consequent imperative to gauge 'a reasonable degree of entitlement given limited resources'. Politics evidently still has a controversial life ahead of it.</p>

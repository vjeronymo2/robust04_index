			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> TRAVELERS CROWD O.C. AIRPORT  </P> <P> With the busiest travel day of the year well in gear, John Wayne Airport  officials reported no major problems this morning as the first of an expected  18,000 holiday travelers crossed the corridors in the 2-month-old facility.  </P> <P> Airport spokeswoman Courtney Wiercioch reported heavy traffic early this  morning but smooth going as only a few additional operations workers were  required to keep the traffic moving.  </P> <P> So far, Wiercioch said, the largest crowds appeared during the morning rush  hour. She was expecting another crunch period between 4 and 7 this evening.  </P> <P> Before their arrival at John Wayne, travelers were flooding local cab companies  and shuttle services with calls.  </P> <P> Yellow Cab Manager Fred McCuistion said his drivers were arriving at travelers'  homes by 5:30 a.m. to ensure their arrival at the airport for 7 a.m. flights.  By late morning, McCuistion said dispatchers had 14 callers waiting for  service, most of them headed to the airport. For those who had not made  reservations, he said, waiting times averaged 35 minutes.  </P></p>

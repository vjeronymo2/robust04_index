			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Man from Wells Fargo hopes to set stage for growth Mr Bob Joss, the former Wells Fargo executive imported from the US two years ago to sort out the turmoil at Westpac, the most troubled of Australia's big banks, was asked yesterday whether he had succeeded in changing the company's culture. 'No, not by any stretch of the imagination,' he replied, bluntly. Mr Joss added that while he 'feels good' about the start that has been made, his experience and observations of other companies suggested that this would be a decade-long process. Shareholders, who sat through Westpac's miserable performance in the early 1990s and are still seeing dividends at one-third of 1990 levels, may be getting worried. Fortunately, Westpac's financial performance showed a significant improvement yesterday, even if internal changes are taking longer to effect. The bottom-line profit figure of ADollars 704.7m was below the more ambitious market forecasts, causing the shares to dip 7 cents to ADollars 4.29. But analysts came away from yesterday's afternoon's briefing suggesting that this may have been harsh. The shortfall on expectations, they said, could be explained by unforeseen items: the provision for drought-related loan problems, and a ADollars 66.3m charge before tax related to the pre-payment of superannuation expenses, which compared with a ADollars 296.1m surplus in the previous year. In future, the bank proposes to adopt UK accounting practice - at least, until an appropriate Australian standard is agreed - which should remove this volatility. The analysts' main focus was on three issues: Westpac's problem loan experience, its net interest margin, and its progress in achieving cost/ efficiency gains. On the first, the picture looked a lot brighter than in previous years, with total impaired assets falling to ADollars 3.8bn by end-September from ADollars 8bn in 1992 and ADollars 6.6bn in 1993. That meant that the ratio of impaired assets to total loans and acceptances stood at about 5 per cent, half the level two years ago. 'The key is problem assets,' said one analyst at ANZ McCaughan, 'and Westpac is getting itself into shape.' However, Mr Joss is the first to admit that more needs to be done. The ratio, he commented yesterday, 'has got to get lower', and he indicated a 1 to 2 per cent target range as a sign of 'a really healthy bank'. Although net proceeds from property disposals were about ADollars 1.6bn last year, Westpac says it still has about ADollars 1bn worth of property to be sold. The net interest margin improved by 50 basis points to 3.5 per cent in the year. Westpac said that the reduced cost of funding impaired assets, as these fell, accounted for an improvement of 30 basis points. The spread on productive overseas assets rose by a similar amount, as the bank cut back overseas operations, exited lower yielding corporate facilities, and focused on 'core Australasian customer relations'. The cost improvement was seen as slightly sluggish in the second half, with branch restructuring taking a little longer than expected to implement. Average staff numbers in the second half were 31,681, compared with more than 45,000 in 1990. Mr Joss says that staff numbers will fall again in the current year, but at a slower rate than in previous years. The ratio of non-interest expenses to income has reached 59.5 per cent overall, compared with 65.5 per cent previously. In spite of yesterday's profit news, the jury is still out on the management changes at Westpac. Mr Joss has brought in a host of new senior executives - in many cases, from outside Australia - and some think that the objectivity which flows from this strategy compares favourably with the less radical approach by rivals. But not everyone is giving the high-profile chief executive, whose US-style remuneration package and management approach has caused much local comment, all the credit for recent financial improvements. 'That's a little bit too favourable towards Joss. He's benefiting, but it's really external changes like the improvement in the property market and so on,' was one less generous comment yesterday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Kong Qicai (1313 0366 2088): "Hebei Provincial Leaders </F> Discussed Program for Making the Province Strong With CPPCC  Members"]    [Text] On the morning of 28 February, the second session of  the seventh provincial committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] held the second  meeting. At the meeting, CPPCC members talked freely and  suggested ways and means for making the province strong.  Provincial Leaders Cheng Weigao, Ye Liansong, Li Bingliang, and  Guo Hongqi conscientiously heard the CPPCC members' opinions at  the meeting.    Present at the meeting were Li Wenshan, chairman of the  provincial party committee; Zhang Runshen, Wang Shusen, Huang  Feng, Zhao Huichen, Ma Xinyun, Yu Zhenzhong, Chen Hui, and Zhao  Yan, vice chairmen of the provincial CPPCC committee; Li Wenzao,  secretary general of the provincial CPPCC committee; and Wang  Jian, Yuan Qinghe, and Zhang Xu, principal responsible persons  of the provincial democratic parties and mass organizations.    CPPCC members Yu Zhenzhong, Gao Daoshen, Tian Zhijie, Li  Debao, Zhang Jiashu, Chen Hui, Zhang Mugang, Wei Hua, and Zhang  Xu made speeches in succession. Their subjects were related to  industrial and agricultural production, education, improvement  of administrative honesty, and development of private and  individual sectors of the economy. They affirmatively made  opinions and suggestions on setting up the modern enterprise  system, urgently cultivating modern entrepreneurs, further  intensifying the dynamics of halting the deficits of  money-losing industrial enterprises, processing of farm and  sideline products, promoting "high-yield, high-efficiency, and  good-quality" agriculture, not being an educationally weak  province at the time of building an economically powerful  province, strengthening the improvement of administrative  honesty, and deeply and constantly waging the struggle against  corruption.    Cheng Weigao maintained that the CPPCC members made good and  accurate criticisms, analyses, and suggestions and also  expressed his views on each and every member's speech. He  agreed to the members' viewpoints and maintained that we still  have to rely on outstanding entrepreneurs in order to develop  good products and achieve technological transformation. With  good entrepreneurs, enterprises will be able to make faster  development and their staff and workers' living standards and  benefits will be greatly improved. He pointed out: An  entrepreneur who is not competent for his job at one plant must  not be transferred to another. A plant director must not act as  a secretary when he fails to act well as a plant director. From  now on, in line with the regulations as stipulated in the law  governing companies, companies should set up boards of directors  and invite, through a selective process, plant directors and  managers. Those who are responsible for enterprises' bankruptcy  will lose the qualifications for being invited as enterprise  leaders for several years. The situation of not awarding those  with contributions to enlivening enterprises and assuming no  responsibility for the poor management of enterprises must be  changed. The departments concerned should positively cultivate  entrepreneurs when entrepreneurs should upgrade their abilities  and quality in the course of competition.    Cheng Weigao also said: The enterprises' complete and  partial suspension of operation due to losses affects economic  development and social stability. There are many factors for  enterprise losses. Thus, the governments at various levels  should go deep to the grass roots to conduct investigation and  study among enterprises one after another to seek ways and make  countermeasures.    In regard to a CPPCC member's opinions on developing high-  efficiency agriculture, Cheng Weigao said: An important factor  for increasing agriculture's economic results and peasants'  income is to achieve intensive processing of farm and sideline  products. The peasants cannot become fairly well-off if they  only develop grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops. By  developing grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops, they can only  become sufficient in food and clothes. So, it is necessary to  develop intense processing of forest fruits, melons, vegetables,  livestock products, aquatic products, and farm and sideline  products. The key to developing processing of farm and sideline  products is to develop markets, to link international markets  with domestic ones, and to take markets as a lead to promote the  development of processing and cropping industries.    In line with a CPPCC member's opinion on accelerating  technological transformation among large and medium-sized  chemical industrial enterprises, Cheng Weigao said: Chemical  industry, as a pillar industry and a key trade of our province,  has brought our province's advantages into play and helped  promote the readjustment of the province's industrial structure.  However, chemical fertilizers account for a larger proportion  in the province's chemical industrial trade when the chemical  industrial raw materials and fine chemical industry account for  an excessively small proportion. This is a problem. Our  province has no large-scale petrochemical industrial enterprises  but only a few salt chemical industrial enterprises. We have  not yet made a start or a breakthrough in developing the coal  chemical industry. The chemical industrial trade has to launch  several big battles and firmly develop key capital construction  and technological transformation projects. Chemical fertilizer  enterprises should also develop "chemical-based fertilizers and  combine fertilizers with chemicals."    Cheng Weigao paid attention to a CPPCC member's opinion on  attaching importance to education in the course of building an  economically powerful province, and also stressed the necessity  to increase input in education and to conduct educational reform.    In regard to the issue of opposing corruption and advocating  administrative honesty, Cheng Weigao said: Last year, we  conscientiously attended to the work in this regard and made  appropriate achievements. This year, we should make unswerving  efforts to attend to it in a better and firmer manner.    In regard to the issue of opening to the outside world,  Cheng  Weigao stressed: Hebei should fully use the advantages of  Beijing and Tianjin to develop the export-oriented economy. The  key to developing the export-oriented economy is to create a  good investment environment, particularly an intangible  environment, for foreign traders. It is necessary to stress  reputation and efficiency, to offer good service, and to upgrade  the quality of the Chinese cooperation partners.    Cheng Weigao readily agreed to the suggestion on  accelerating  the development of private and individual sectors of the  economy. He said: Government departments equally treat  state-owned, collective, individual, and private enterprises  according to the market economy's requirements. The CPPCC  members have conscientiously played the functions for political  consultation and democratic supervision and provided many  affirmative opinions and suggestions for the party and the  government. On behalf of the provincial party committee and  government, I express heartfelt thanks to them.    Governor Ye Liansong conscientiously heard the CPPCC  members'  speeches, made written instructions on each and every member's  opinions and suggestions, and transmitted the instructions to  relevant departments and leaders for conscious study and  implementation.    Ye Liansong's written instructions on CPPCC Member Gao  Daoshen's opinion on halting the deficits of industrial  enterprise read: From the beginning of the year, the  provincial, city, prefectural, and county committees for foreign  economic relations and trade (economic commissions) and the  departments in charge of enterprise work should strengthen the  dynamics of halting deficits and work out different  deficit-halting measures for different enterprises. The  provincial government may organize personnel of the committees  for foreign economic relations and trade, industrial departments  and bureaus, and industrial and economic federations; and sent  them deep to Handan, Xingtai, and the cities, prefectures, and  enterprises with prominent problems to conduct on-the-spot  investigation and study and to solve the problems on the spot.    Ye Liansong's written instructions on CPPCC Member Zhang  Mugang's opinions, made on behalf of the provincial Chinese  peasants and workers democratic party, on strengthening the  improvement of administrative honesty and deeply and constantly  waging the struggle against corruption read: CPPCC member Zhang  Mugang's speech is very good. We should unswervingly grasp the  improvement of administrative honesty and the struggle against  corruption. I will ask Comrade Youhui to transmit this to the  supervisory department for conscientious study and realistic  implementation.    Wang Manqiu, vice chairman of the provincial CPPCC  committee,  chaired today's meeting.</p>

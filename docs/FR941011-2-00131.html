The proposed rule change contains procedures which will permit DTC's ID system to be used to comply with the Division's prime broker letter and to facilitate the option of settling affirmed prime broker trades through the National Securities Clearing Corporation's (``NSCC'') continuous net settlement (``CNS'') system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1 (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter from Brandon Becker, Director, Division, Commission, to Jeffrey Bernstein, Prime Broker Committee (January 25, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A prime broker is a broker-dealer participating in the ID system that provides a custodial facility for institutional customers. Under the proposed rule change, broker-dealers that are members of both DTC and the NSCC and that participate in DTC's ID system and NSCC's CNS system, will have the option to settle affirmed prime broker trades through the ID system or through NSCC's CNS system. A common member executing trades on behalf of an institutional customer (``executing broker'') will report trade details to DTC for initial processing through the ID system. At the time of submission, the executing broker will be required to determine whether a trade will settle on a trade-for-trade basis through the ID system or through CNS. If the executing brokers choose the former, the trade will settle through DTC's customary ID procedures. If the executing brokers chooses to settle the trade through CNS, they will submit a prime broker's CNS agent ID number to DTC when reporting the details of the trade. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Prime brokers are required to maintain two or more agent ID numbers. One of these numbers will be reserved as a special number to be used only for trades that are directed to settle through NSCC's CNS system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> TEAR GAS USED TO QUELL N.Y. JAIL RIOT  </P> <P> Officers used tear gas to quell a jail riot early today and then negotiated an  end to a standoff with 150 other inmates who barricaded themselves in their  dorms with piled-up furniture, officials said.  </P> <P> Six officers and six inmates were taken to a hospital as a precaution, but no  serious injuries were reported in the uprising at the 2,700-inmate jail on  Rikers Island, said Correction Department spokeswoman Ruby Ryles.  </P> <P> About 50 inmates set fires and blockaded their dorm with mattresses,  complaining that one of two men removed earlier from the unit for fighting had  been unfairly punished, Ryles said.  </P></p>

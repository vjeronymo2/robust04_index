			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLEWATCH  </P> <P> Bedding Down With John and Yoko: Pop fans will have the chance to sleep in the  Amsterdam hotel room where John Lennon and Yoko Ono held their famous "bed-in"  for world peace in 1969. To mark the 21st anniversary of the couple's  celebrated protest, the Amsterdam Hilton has re-created the bedroom suite and  is charging guests $750 a night to sleep there.  </P> <P> One item will be missing -- the original bed used by Lennon and his wife. "We  change all our beds every five years or so. I've no idea what happened to the  original one," said Hilton spokesman Jan van der Putten. "We are refurbishing  the suite as it was at the time, but with a few extra modern comforts like a  whirlpool and a complete set of Lennon's music on compact disc." The former  Beatle, who was murdered outside his New York apartment 10 years ago, and his  wife held court to the world press from their bed in 1969, calling for  universal love and staying in bed for several days, surrounded by flowers and  posters.

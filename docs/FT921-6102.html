			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Smaller businesses send mixed signal A MIXED picture of prospects for small and medium-sized businesses is shown by three surveys published yesterday. Business confidence is higher among businesses with a turnover of less than Pounds 30m than among the country's top 600 corporations, according to parallel surveys carried out by accountancy firm Kidsons Impey and the Association of Chartered Treasurers. This positive view is not mirrored in the latest NatWest quarterly survey of small businesses, which found continued small-business pessimism about the outlook for sales and employment levels in the first quarter of this year. More businesses expected sales to fall than to rise, by a margin of 10 percentage points, while more companies expected job levels to fall, by a record margin of 17 points. There were some signs that the recession may have bottomed out, the NatWest survey of nearly 1,700 businesses reported. More businesses reported lower sales and lower employment levels in the fourth quarter of last year than reported increases, but the negative balance was smaller than in the preceding quarter. The Kidsons Impey survey of 210 businesses showed 66 per cent of smaller businesses were optimistic about their immediate prospects, while the chartered treasurers' survey of 600 big companies found that just 50 per cent were optimistic about their future. Smaller companies were more optimistic about prospects for their sector, with 55 per cent expecting an improvement against just 24 per cent of the large companies. The Kidsons Impey survey identified increased consumer demand as the factor most small and medium-sized businesses viewed as essential for recovery, while the NatWest survey said low turnover and lack of business were the most common problem.

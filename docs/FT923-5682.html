			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / International Company News: Toronto Dominion Bank turns in 16% decline TORONTO DOMINION Bank, Canada's fifth largest, reported a 16 per cent decline in third-quarter profit due mainly to higher loan loss provisions, Nine-month earnings were down 22 per cent. The higher provisions were made on Canadian foreign corporate loans in view of the persistent recession in leading markets, the bank said. The fiscal 1992 loan loss estimate has been increased by CDollars 55m (USDollars 46m) to CDollars 535m, resulting in a CDollars 148m charge to income in the latest quarter against CDollars 120m in each of the previous two quarters. Final third-quarter profit was CDollars 101m, or 31 cents a share, against CDollars 120m, or 37 cents a share, a year earlier, and in the first nine months CDollars 295m, or 90 cents a share, against CDollars 377m, or CDollars 1.14 a share, a year earlier. Net non-performing loans were CDollars 1.7bn at July 31, up CDollars 215m from October 31 1991, with international loans proportionately more affected than domestic. The latest quarter showed a return on equity of 8.3 per cent against 10.1 per cent a year earlier, and a return on assets of 0.58 per cent against 0.69 per cent. Non-interest expenses rose 9 per cent, partly due to spending on premises. Total assets at July 31 were CDollars 72bn against CDollars 68bn a year earlier.</p>

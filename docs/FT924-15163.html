			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Abbot offer for Blystad goes unconditional THE offer for Blystad, the Norwegian-controlled group which owns KCA Drilling, the profitable oil services company, was made unconditional yesterday. Abbot Holdings, a private company set up for the purpose of the bid by Mr Alistair Locke, yesterday said it had received irrevocable acceptances for its offer from shareholders speaking for 65.2 per cent of Blystad shares. Acceptances related to the stake controlled by the three Blystad brothers who are directors. Last week the Takeover Panel ruled that the bid could proceed, dismissing an argument from independent directors that there had been an arrangement between the Blystad brothers and Abbot. The Bank of Ireland, Abbot's advisers, estimates that the present value of Abbot preference shares being offered to Blystad shareholders is 5.4p. This represents a 20 per cent premium to the 4.5p Blystad share price before the bid. This preference share offer values Blystad at Pounds 7.5m. Blystad has not paid a dividend for seven years.</p>

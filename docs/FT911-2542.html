			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Australian docks employers reject Hawke wages deal PROSPECTS of early agreement on Australian docks reform receded yesterday after employers declined to accept a wagesdeal drawn up between the trade unions and Mr Bob Hawke, the Labor prime minister, Kevin Brown writes. The deal was rejected by Conaust, the largest stevedoring company, a subsidiary of P&amp;O, and strongly criticised by the Association of Waterfront Employers of Labour. The deal followed intervention by MrHawke to defuse a moratorium on reform announced by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) in protest against a 2.5 per cent wages award by the Industrial Relations Commission. The award conflicted with an earlier wages agreement between the ACTU and the government, known as the Accord, under which workers in most industries were to receive ADollars 12 (Pounds 5.40) per week from May 16, together withfurther productivity-backed payments to be negotiated at company level. The commission's refusal to approve the award places the Accord in jeopardy, and could lead to changes in industrial relations law if the government decides to by-passthe court. The docks employers' association said it was concernedabout the legal implications of accepting the deal given that it was negotiatedoutside Australia's centralised wage-fixing system. The association isexpected to decide today to seek further talks with the government on how the deal would affect employers' legal protection from strikes called without the approval of the courts. A special ACTU conference will decide tomorrow whether to back a campaign of industrial action for full payment of the Accord acrossall industries.</p>

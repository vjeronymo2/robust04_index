			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> POLICE READY; ZODIAC KILLER ISN'T  </P> <P> Scores of detectives and hundreds of police officers spread out across the city  in anticipation of a fifth attack by the Zodiac killer this morning, but the  astrology-obsessed gunman did not strike.  </P> <P> The pre-dawn hours of today were considered a target night for the gunman,  based on his pattern of striking on early Thursdays at 21-day intervals or  multiples thereof.  </P> <P> Today marked 42 days since the gunman's attack on a homeless man sleeping on a  Central Park bench. It is also in the sign of Leo, believed to be the  astrological sign of the gunman's next victim.  </P> <P> The gunman has sent six letters to police and the media, threatening to kill 12  people, one for each astrological sign.  </P></p>

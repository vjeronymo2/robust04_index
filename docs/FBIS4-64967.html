			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Serdar Turgut: "The United States Has Been </F> Deceiving the World During the Past Year"]    [Text] Washington--The United States has deceived the world  on the embargo on Iraq during the past year. The U.S.  Administration has bought diesel oil and kerosene from Iraq and  distributed them free to the Kurds in the north of the country  during the past year. A U.S. State Department official said:  "It is true we have acquired kerosene and diesel oil through  middlemen in northern Iraq and used them for humanitarian  purposes. But I do not understand why that surprises you. It  is not a new development. The operation has been continuing for  about a year now."    The revelation that the United States has violated the  embargo when it directed pressure on foreign countries and gave  ultimatums to them to remain committed to the sanctions comes as  a surprise. Turkey was informed of the operation that has been  going on during the past year only two weeks ago. The Turkish  Ministry of Foreign Affairs was informed of the U.S. policy of  double standards in telegrams from Washington. But the reason  Turkey has refrained from using the information in its talks  with the U.S. officials on Iraq's oil remains unanswered.    Although it has been revealed that the United States has  purchased oil from Iraq during the past year, the U.S.  Administration has been reluctant to admit that the operation  violates the embargo. It has claimed that the kerosene and  diesel oil were not directly acquired from Iraq. The officials  acquired them from Jordanian middlemen who have long been  transferring oil in tankers from that country. The U.S.  Administration also claimed that the kerosene and diesel oil  were used for humanitarian purposes, stressing that the embargo  has not been violated. The reason they give is that it was not  sold.    Although the U.S. Administration has tried to describe the  operation as a legitimate move, it has given Iraq an opportunity  to profit through Jordanian middlemen.</p>

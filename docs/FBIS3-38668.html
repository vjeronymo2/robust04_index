Does this not mean, however, that  if you want to take over the government, this would require  revising the Wiesbaden party congress resolution that rules out  Bundeswehr operations as combat missions?    [Scharping] No, not at all. I also said in Munich that we  did not give up sovereign rights when we joined the United  Nations. Therefore, we ourselves decide whether and to what  extent we participate in UN measures. This is the only central  difference with the Federal Government. We, the Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], and a government headed by it  will not send the Bundeswehr to combat missions anywhere in the  world.    [Ellgaard] If you took over the government, would you  maintain compulsory military service? After all, this is a  problem in view of the current thrift measures.    [Scharping] Of course. Compulsory military service is a  very central element for the democratic anchoring of the  Bundeswehr, and it is part of the political culture in Germany.  I think that it must remain in existence.    [Ellgaard] Mr. Scharping, yesterday's pictures, the massacre  in Sarajevo, shocked the world. Does the West not finally have  to make a military intervention now? What is your position?    [Scharping] It is the same position as that of the U.S.  secretary of state. We must step up the pressure, but military  intervention would worsen the bloodshed rather than stop it.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Spain - Banking, Finance and Investment (3): Banesto joins the crisis list / David White follows a drama few believed could ever hit the top bank It was the longest shareholders' meeting anybody in Spanish banking could remember and at moments came close to anarchy. A succession of small shareholders stood up to protest about being swindled. About 6,000 people turned up to the exhibition hall outside Madrid for the meeting, on March 26, although most had gone by the time it ended nine hours later. The outcome had been determined by proxy votes supporting the restructuring plan for Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), opening the way for its sale and the conclusion of the most spectacular crisis ever to hit a top Spanish bank. In the midst of this, protesters carried a banner through the lines of chairs with a single word on it: 'Rumasa' - a reminder that, while the authorities and the banking community were making a concerted effort to treat the upset at Banesto as a unique case and prevent panic spreading to other institutions, the symptoms of the case were not without precedent in Spain. In February 1983 the Socialist government, then newly arrived in power, had also taken a deep breath and seized Rumasa, the country's largest privately-owned holding group, to prevent a collapse that threatened to shake the country's whole financial system. There were clear differences between the two cases. Rumasa was expropriated outright and sold off bit by bit while the Bank of Spain intervened in Banesto with a view to re-launching the bank as quickly as possible under new control. There were also contrasts between the men at the centre of the two affairs. Jose Maria Ruiz-Mateos is a self-made man, devout member of the lay organisation Opus Dei, who built a small family sherry business into an empire including hotels, stores, building, agrobusiness, insurance and 18 banks. The glamorous Mario Conde is a clever lawyer who sold his stake in a pharmaceuticals company for a large sum and parachuted into the chairmanship of Banesto at the age of 39 as it was fighting off a hostile takeover bid. They do, however, have some things in common. Both are outsiders who have tried to take on the banking establishment and the government; they are ingenious financial manipulators who face allegations of irregularities; and both headed groups in which banks and industrial companies co-existed in complex relationships that went seriously awry when business conditions became tough. In Rumasa's case, it was the banks that belonged to the industrial group and were used to finance it. In Banesto's case, industrial participations belonging to the bank compounded the problems in its lending business. Spain sometimes has a short memory, but it should know a bit about bank crises. In the 15 years from 1978 there were 30 bank collapses, not counting that of Rumasa. The series culminated in 1982/3 with several big names. Apart from Banco Atlantico - Rumasa's Barcelona-based flagship, now controlled by the Arab Banking Corporation - Banca Catalana and Banco Urquijo were also brought down by industrial investments. In Spain, the German model of leading banks at the centre of a web of industrial interests has frequently been found not to work well. At the time of the Rumasa expropriation, it was unimaginable that Banesto should meet a similar fate. Banesto was still the top Spanish bank by the size of its customer deposits. Founded in 1902, it was for decades the epitome of banking in Spain, stodgy, conservative, but solid and ultra-respectable. Its pride in its retail network, reaching into the farthest corners of the country, is recorded in bronze in the lists of branch names adorning the outside walls of its old head office in central Madrid. Ironically, Mr Ruiz-Mateos had tried, unsuccessfully, to get into Banesto as a leading minority shareholder in 1982. 'I am convinced,' he wrote recently, 'that collaboration between Rumasa and Banesto would have been enormously beneficial for the national economy, and would have avoided the great drama of Spanish capitalism, the destruction of our industrial and financial fabric.' From the end of 1987, Mr Conde took Banesto on a new path of aggressive lending. The bank's loan volume rose rose 109 per cent in the four years from 1988 to 1991, twice the rate of growth in the rest of the banking sector. It had to pay a high price to finance this expansion, competing with Banco Santander - its eventual new owner - in offering interest-bearing accounts. The concentration of risks was accentuated by lending to recession-hit companies in its industrial holding group. Efforts to consolidate through provisions and a Pta95bn capital increase last year proved insufficient. The Bank of Spain moved in on December 28, overriding the plans which JP Morgan of the US had laid for bailing the bank out. Auditors subsequently raised their estimate of the hidden losses at the bank by 20 per cent to Pta605bn. The rescue, including funds to cover non-performing assets and an interest-free credit to offset current losses, will have cost the Bank of Spain and the private banking system about Pta96bn each, taking into account the profit made by selling newly-created shares at a premium to Banco Santander. The latter, which has declared its intention of holding on to at least a 40 per cent share, is setting about selling Banesto's industrial holdings and - through Bankers Trust - the stakes which Mr Conde built up in newspapers and TV stations. To stop Banesto having a negative impact on its consolidated results, it says it will need to recover some Pta300bn of dubious Banesto loans.</p>

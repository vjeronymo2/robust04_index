			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Cuts 'will reduce capital spending' CUTS will claw back the increase in revenue to local authority housing for spending on capital projects announced by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in last year's Autumn Statement, the Institute of Housing says today, Scheherazade Daneshkhu writes. It says in a survey the amount raised will be far less than the Pounds 1.75bn anticipated by Mr Lamont as a result of his decision to allow local authorities to spend all capital receipts generated from the sale of assets in the year to December 1993. The government first estimated that of this amount, Pounds 1.1bn would be available from the sale of housing assets, a figure which the Department of the Environment has revised to Pounds 950m. The institute's estimate is that housing receipts would total about Pounds 750m. The survey of 30 directors of housing authorities was undertaken to establish whether housing receipts were likely to create the investment in growth anticipated by the government and whether there was evidence that receipts were helping to produce more homes to rent. It finds that although the authorities anticipate generating Pounds 150m in receipts this year, with Pounds 80m already earmarked for housing investment, there will be no new local-authority building and only 400 additional homes will be built through housing associ-ations.</p>

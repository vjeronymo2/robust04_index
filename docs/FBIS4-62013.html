			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 12 ITAR-TASS -- Commenting on President  Yeltsin's visit to Germany the newspaper SEVODNYA (TODAY)  writes: The president of Russia hopes that with Germany's  support Russia can become a genuine European power. "I believe  Helmut Kohl, I believe his moral principles," President Yeltsin  said, and this belief provides the basis for Russia's membership  of the Council of Europe.    Upon his return from Germany, President Yeltsin is expected  to submit to the Federation Council six nominees for the  vacancies in the Constitutional Court, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  surmises.    The same newspaper carries an article by Russian Minister  for  Nationalities and Regional Policies Sergey Shakhray, who says  among other things: "One of the chief thesis of the regional  policy is that the diversity of Russian regions and the  multinational composition of the Russian state is not a weakness  of Russia's. It is the country's potential might, its potential  advantage over many other states. There is no alternative at  present: whether the former soviet republics should or should  not integrate within the frame of the Commonwealth of  Independent States. The option lies elsewhere; whether this  integration will proceed in a civilized manner, through  voluntary and equal unification or in an uncontrolled way with  the use of force. This is the choice Russian society is facing  at present".    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI publishes an interview with State Duma  Chairman Ivan Rybkin. Rybkin says that "within a short time, we  have succeeded in establishing mutual understanding and  interaction between the president and the State Duma, the State  Duma and the Federation Council, the State Duma and the judicial  branch of power. This is very, very important. It is possible  to say that one hundred days of work is a short period of time  to allow such a conclusion to be drawn. But ours is the time  when one day counts for two and even for three".    The newspaper SEVODNYA quoted Russian delegation leader to  talks with Estonia Ambassador Vasiliy Svirin [title and name as  received] as saying that "Russia sees no point in continuing  futile negotiations with Estonia". Ambassador Svirin told  SEVODNYA that the reason for the impasse in the negotiation lies  in Estonia's going back on the obligations it assumed earlier  (particularly as concerns the retired Russian Army servicemen  residing in Estonia and the refusal of Estonia to contribute to  the building of housing in Russia for the servicemen leaving  Estonia). In this connection Moscow has told Tallinn that the  earlier deadline for the withdrawal of the remaining Russian  contingent from that Baltic republic is "no longer relevant".    NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA (THE NEW DAILY) mentions the  trial of the August 1991 coup plotters. "What was expected  almost from the very beginning of the trial has now come to  pass: The trial ended in nothing, even before it began properly.  Although volumes of in- service reports were written and  hundreds of witnesses were questioned, thousands of interviews  were given and even books were published, all those who were  involved even in the least were sure that this is one of the  "eternal cases" which can lead nowhere".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA quips "the trial of the century is over." It  appears that everyone agrees to this with the exception of the  former commander of the Soviet land forces, General Valentin  Varennikov. In an exclusive interview with KRASNAYA ZVEZDA,  Varennikov's lawyer Dmitriy Steiberg stressed that Valentin  Varennikov's rejection of the amnesty is not new. Having denied  his guilt at the moment of his arrest and then in the course of  the examination of the case in the courtroom, Varennikov first  spoke out categorically against the amnesty at the court session  which followed immediately after the amnesty was announced. He  insists that the trial continue and that he be given the  opportunity to prove his innocence".    SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA carries an interview with State Duma  deputy economist Vladimir Lisichkin, who touches upon problems  relating to privatisation in the Russian Federation. "The  ownership of the national wealth, which under the communist rule  belonged to the people, was realized through the consumption  funds. Of course there were deviations from the fair  distribution of the wealth, but the underlying principle was  sound. The national wealth was to be managed in a way that  permitted every citizen to partake of it. It is silly to say  that the people had nothing under the Soviet power and Mr.  Chubays is now returning the wealth to the people. Mr. Chubays  is telling us that the division of the property is proceeding  painlessly. It is a lie. I repeat: an undeclared civil war is  underway. And there is blood, blood flowing. Even though  nobody seems to be objecting to privatisation."    PRAVDA carries an interview with Gennadiy Tretyakov, a  functionary of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan. Concerning  relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia, Tretyakov says: "We  are neighbours, and we must find a way out of this war. I think  that the preamble to negotiations can be provided by mutual  agreement on the inviolability of the territorial integrity of  Azerbaijan and Armenia, with every citizen, regardless of  nationality and domicile, enjoying full civil rights".    St. Petersburg's best hotel, which is full up at any time of  the year and which has accommodated presidents, ministers,  bankers and top stars is on the verge of insolvency, the  newspaper SANKT PETERBURGSKIE VEDOMOSTI writes about Grand Hotel  Europe run by a Swedish company, although it is nominally  administered by Russians and the city authorities hold a  controlling interest in it. The economic and legal confusion in  the country, as well as financial machinations of the foreign  partners, who seek to bank on the chaos, have brought the hotel  to the verge of bankruptcy, particulary since even the loans  with which it was reconstructed have yet to be repaid.</p>

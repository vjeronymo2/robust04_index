			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Sport: Pavarotti in the ballpark So the two glamour teams finally got it together, serenaded by the three heavenly voices. This was as it should be. This was the perfect conjunction  -the one, perhaps, that was dreamed of on the day, more than four years ago, when a prophetic soul at the BBC decided that nothing less than Luciano Pavarotti singing Nessun Dorma was good enough for the World Cup. How ridiculous it seemed, at the beginning of Italia '90, that such a voice should be swelling our emotions to such a pitch in preparation for a qualifying match between Ireland and Egypt. What was the BBC playing at? Had it never heard of INXS? Who was this rogue romantic, this complicated personality who knew about football yet knew about opera, and who believed that Puccini could provide an anthem for the terraces? Whoever they were, they took a bold and beautiful decision. They may have only taken it because the World Cup was being held in Italy. Whatever the reason, the decision expressed a belief that football could be something majestic and, unlikely as that then seemed, football became something majestic: it lived up to its signature tune. By the end of Italia '90, Nessun Dorma was no longer inappropriate. It was the only accompaniment possible. Even when the football let the music down - as it did, inevitably, and never more so than in the nasty little final between Germany and Argentina - that did not matter. The soft, liquid sensations aroused by the music had massaged and oiled the uptight emotions of the football fan, and reminded him of the greater gratifications that the game can give. Such as those that I felt on the evening before England played in the World Cup semi-final, when I sat in a pub and felt an unspoken kinship with every person there; if the sound of Nessun Dorma had filled the bar I think we might all have dissolved together in tears. The music revealed an image of the game beyond the narrow, banal thing that English football so often is. This image had been forgotten during the dour, violent years of Heysel and Hillsborough, and was lost again during the tense, farcical years of Graham Taylor. Now, however, it can be found far more easily, because it has been identified forever with the sound of a heavenly voice. But the opera factor did not merely reveal an image of football. It helped to change its image. If, in the summer of 1990, Gary Lineker and Paul Gascoigne brought the game to a wider audience, so too did Pavarotti and Puccini: they took football into the world beyond itself, a place where it had not been for some time. So many people then thought of football as something that could never be important to them, only to people as unlike them as possible - obsessives, hooligans, sickos, men. But the fact that this music, something which was part of their world, could be proudly heralding the way into the world of football, helped to sanction their emotional engagement with the World Cup. Who is to say that they would have wept with Paul Gascoigne if Pavarotti had not already cleared a path through their tear ducts? These people have not all stayed with football, but however brief their love affair with the game, it has had its effect. Who, just over four years ago, would have imagined that intellectuals would want to deconstruct the image of a daft, over-hyped Geordie? Or that guests at upmarket dinner parties would desribe the eruption of Ian Wright onto a football pitch with the verve that they had previously used to conjure the image of MacBeth upon an RSC stage? Or that bright young women would be proclaiming their passion for Ryan Giggs across the pages of quality newspapers? This didn't all happen because Pavarotti sang. But the moment, sometime during Italia '90, when Nessun Dorma ceased to sound out of place and began to sound magnificently right, was, I believe, the moment that it all became possible. And yet, for all that, the image of football as something splendid, stylish and emotionally unifying remains a dream. The dream took on life in 1966, it came to half-life in 1990, and last season Manchester United gave it some life again; but still the English seem never quite to believe in it. For all their love of the game, they seem to think of football as a source of perverse, not pure, pleasure. They are passionately defensive about it, but in truth they have a low opinion of it, low expectations from it. Is that why England don't play like Italy or Brazil? In those countries, nobody would think it remarkable that clever types, smart types, female types, have decided to fall in love with football. The only thing that would surprise them was that such people had not done so earlier; for in Italy and Brazil, everybody loves football, and this is because they see their game differently. The English dream of football is their reality. It makes no difference how badly their teams play; nothing can make the game anything less than naturally majestic. The faces of the Italian and Brazilian fans reflect the fact that football is part of the whole of their lives. Compared with the strained, inhibited expression of the English fan, they look full of emotion, free with it, just as they would be if they were hearing Nessun Dorma. And they do hear it, every time they see a football passed around the pitch: the two glamour teams and the three heavenly voices inhabit the same world.</p>

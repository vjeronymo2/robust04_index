			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Gorbachev faces prospect of leadership challenge PRESIDENT Mikhail Gorbachev faces a potential challenge to his leadership from within the ranks of his own Communist party when he returns from this week's visit to Tokyo. The hardline Soyuz (Union) parliamentary group meets in Moscow this weekend to consider calls by many members for Mr Gorbachev to step down as Soviet president. At the same time, his opponents in the party apparatus are threatening to call for his resignation as party general secretary at a central committee plenum on Wednesday.

Mr Stanislav Girenko, the Ukrainian party chief, said Mr Gorbachev should not combine the two posts of president and general secretary. The threats are tempered by the awareness of many Communists that getting rid of Mr Gorbachev could lose the party whatever authority it has left. Mr Nikolai Stolyarov, a central committee member and a senior official of the hardline Russian Communist Party, said yesterday: 'I think and hope that the plenum will show enough political realism to understand a simple truth - you cannot put all the responsibility for what is happening in the country on the shoulders of one leader.'</p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRITISH AIRWAYS CHAIRMAN IS SURE U.S. WILL OK UAL DEAL  </P> <P> The chairman of British Airways said Tuesday he is confident that the airline's  $750-million investment in UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, will  receive U.S. regulatory approval.  </P> <P> Speaking at a press conference in London, British Airways Chairman John King  said the deal was structured to comply with rules that limit foreign ownership  of U.S. airlines. "I don't believe it poses any major problems for the U.S.  regulatory authorities," he said.  </P> <P> British Airways is backing the $6.75-billion employee buyout of UAL and will  own 15% of the airline when the transaction is completed. Federal rules limit  foreign investment to 25% of a U.S. carrier.  </P> <P> Department of Transportation officials have recently voiced concern about  foreign investment and have said it is possible for a non-U.S. investor to  exercise control over an American airline even though its ownership stake is  under the federal limit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Long List of Financial Data  </P> <P> Transportation Department officials want KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, for example,  to reduce its stake in Northwest Airlines and give up its seat on Northwest's  board. Alfred A. Checchi, the Los Angeles financier who acquired Northwest in  June with help from KLM, is negotiating those changes with the department.  </P> <P> There has been speculation that the Transportation Department might take  similar steps with United Airlines, and that British Airways and the United  employee group might be forced to restructure the deal, or reduce the price of  the $300-a-share tender offer. The department has already asked UAL for a long  list of financial information and for an explanation of the relationship  between British Airways and United.  </P> <P> King said Tuesday that he has received no indication that the Transportation  Department has started to investigate the UAL transaction. "The Department of  Transportation is looking at it as a matter of routine, just as it is looking  at the KLM and Northwest deal," he said.  </P> <P> The Transportation Department is expected to announce its decision on Northwest  this week.  </P> <P> King also emphasized that British Airways would have only one of 15 board seats  and said its influence over the board would be minimal. Three board seats would  go to UAL management and three to unions that join the buyout. "It is clear who  will have control," a British Airways spokeswoman said in London.  </P> <P> </P> <P> UAL Stock Up  </P> <P> King said British Airways has formed an internal committee to explore ways that  the two airlines can work together. He said British Airways is interested in  sharing United's terminals in Washington, Chicago and San Diego. He added that  it is possible that United might share British Airways' terminal at John F.  Kennedy International Airport in New York.  </P> <P> King also said the two airlines might develop joint training facilities and  common software for the Galileo computer reservations system. British Airways  is one of nine European airlines that own stakes in Galileo. United owns an  interest through Covia, a U.S. computer reservations system half-owned by  United.  </P> <P> King said British Airways would raise the equivalent of $500 million for the  UAL investment through a rights issue for convertible bonds. The bonds are  convertible into British Airways stock. King said British Airways would borrow  the remaining $250 million.  </P> <P> UAL's shares closed Tuesday at $276.50, up $2.50, on the New York Stock  Exchange.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHIZOPHRENIA DRUG APPROVED WITH TEST PLAN  </P> <P> The federal government on Tuesday approved a new drug to treat severe  schizophrenia and a monitoring program in which patients using the drug will be  tested weekly for signs of a potentially fatal side effect.  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration said the drug, clozapine, can be used only for  patients who have not responded to at least two regimens of standard, less  toxic therapy.  </P> <P> An estimated 200,000 people could benefit, the FDA said.  </P> <P> The drug has been shown to relieve symptoms of severe schizophrenia, allowing  patients to lead more productive lives. But it also can cause a potentially  fatal blood disorder in which the level of white blood cells is reduced.  Studies have shown the condition can be reversed if caught early.  </P> <P> The drug also is associated with seizures, officials said.  </P> <P> Under the monitoring system, a home health care company will distribute the  prescribed medication to patients each week and collect blood samples that will  be sent to a national laboratory for analysis, the FDA said. If the test  results indicate that the patient must stop taking the drug, the patient's  doctor will be notified.  </P></p>

Inherent within the approval of Statewide Transportation Improvement Programs (STIP), planning findings, conformity determinations and certification of the transportation planning process in Transportation Management Areas (TMA) is the fundamental leadership responsibility of FTA and FHWA in ensuring that the transportation planning process addresses the policy goals of the ISTEA. This memorandum articulates our general agency expectations with regard to this planning stewardship and the specific function that certification plays within this broader framework. While certification of the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) TMA planning processes falls within the purview of the metropolitan planning regulations, the basic principles apply to both the statewide and metropolitan planning requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We view certification of the planning process within TMAs as one of a number of the critical mechanisms for ensuring the satisfactory implementation of the planning requirements identified in 23 U.S.C. l34 and 49 U.S.C. 1602. It is perhaps most critical in the sense that it will be a very visible action and formal indication that we have exercised our legal responsibility in meeting this stewardship function. However, the individual planning findings, necessary conformity determinations and STIP approvals provide critical input to this triennial action. We expect our regions to establish procedures for implementing this joint responsibility. While the substance of these decisions must remain consistent across regions, the variation in workload posed by the distribution of TMAs will dictate procedural accommodations by region.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The attached statement of principles and guidance provides a framework for addressing the implementation of the certification requirement. We expect the responsibility for issuing certification determinations to rest jointly with our field offices, working in partnership with Headquarters. The effective implementation of the certification process will require a significant allocation of resources which you should address in the development of regional staffing and travel budgets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Especially in this initial effort and in recognition of the phase-in provisions of the metropolitan planning regulations (Section 45.336), we expect the emphasis to rest on ensuring a good faith effort to implement plan updates and the priorities indicated in the attachment. We also expect that the message conveyed to MPOs, state DOTs and transit operators collectively will be that they are mutually responsible for the continuing enhancement and improvement of the planning process to meet the objectives of the ISTEA planning requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We expect the primary responsibility for implementing our stewardship role to rest with FTA and FHWA field staff. However, this is manifested not only in the certification process, but also in STIP approvals, Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) and STIP planning findings, conformity findings, and unified planning work program approvals. In recognition of our national stewardship role and mandate from the ISTEA, we plan to conduct Enhanced Planning Reviews (EPR) in selected metropolitan areas which will be integrated with the certification processes for the respective metropolitan areas. These EPRs will be done at the request of states, MPOs, transit operators or FTA/FHWA field or Headquarters offices to pursue more complex planning process questions and to assist MPOs in improving their procedures. As a supplement to these EPRs, we plan to develop and implement an overall assessment of the planning process and its implementation under the ISTEA requirements over the next three fiscal years. The results of the planning reviews will provide input to this analysis. The challenge and the expectations are such that we believe that a very visible and substantial assessment is necessary to demonstrate our joint commitment and success in providing the leadership expected of both agencies. You will be hearing more about this initiative as it is developed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </ACTION> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

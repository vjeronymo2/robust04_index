			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Lilley cautious over Lloyd's MR PETER Lilley, trade and industry secretary, indicated yesterday that he does not intend to impose reform on Lloyd's in spite of the political storm over allegations of malpractice at the insurance market. About 25 MPs will today press for action to restore confidence in the regulatory system at a lunch hosted by Lloyd's. One Tory MP said yesterday that Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, was a 'public relations disaster' in spite of his strengths as an underwriter. Suggestions that Lloyd's activities were being seriously disrupted as members threatened legal action were dismissed as 'evident nonsense' by Mr Alan Lord, chief executive. The row follows allegations by Labour MPs last week. These included claims that working Names were given preferential access to better-performing syndicates - an allegation dismissed by Lloyd's. Names are the individuals whose assets provide Lloyd's capital. Mr Lilley, speaking on TV-am, said such allegations could be referred to Lloyd's regulators, to the Serious Fraud Office or to the courts. All those paths should be explored 'before we have to consider whether there's any change in the legal structure that is required'. He added: 'We are obviously keeping under close review - as we do - that market and financial markets generally.' Mr Richard Page, vice-chairman of the Tory backbench trade and industry committee, said the government was right to give Lloyd's time to reform itself. 'But the proviso is that they have got to get on and do it . . . Time delays increase the pressure on the government to take some action,' he said. Mr Lord said it was not true that Lloyd's was running out of money.</p>

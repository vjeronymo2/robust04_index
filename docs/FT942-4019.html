			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Food and Drink: Tastes of paradise: smells of hell - Kieran Cooke samples a fruit with all the aroma of cleaning-out time at a chicken shed Hurley dug his way round Britain. One evening in the dim recesses of a Norwich pub I am sure I saw him strike a match on the palm of his sandpaper hand. Hurley and durians belong to each other. The durian is the king of south-east Asia's fruits. It is big, spiky and ugly. Inside its thick skin the flesh round the seeds - the edible part of the fruit - tastes like Camembert with sunstroke. But it is the smell that distinguishes the durian from any other living thing - except Hurley. Hurley, who spent the main part of the day up to his haunches in water-filled ditches, had terrible problems with his socks. No washing machine could keep his feet in decent order. One day Hurley thought he had found the solution to his problems. A local store advertised indestructible socks - expensive items but guaranteed to withstand all manner of abuse. Down went Hurley and bought a pair. He gave them an exhaustive road test, wearing them for a week, day and night. On the seventh day holes as big as onions appeared in the heels. Hurley and I went back to the store. 'Put your eyes on them things,' said Hurley, slapping the socks, now looking like pieces of malnourished seaweed, on the counter. 'Indestructible you say. I want my money back.' Whenever I catch the whiff of a durian that moment returns. The poor salesgirl gagged. Passing shoppers swooned. Feeling nauseous myself I persuaded Hurley to accept the offer of a silk tie in exchange for his faulty indestructibles. The smell of durians is so pungent that hotels, airlines and bus operators forbid them. Like cheap perfume in a hot dressing room, the smell can linger for days. It is the odour of over-ripe compost, it is cleaning-out time at the chicken sheds. Yet at the mention of durians the eyes of the average resident of south-east Asia go wild with desire. Lips salivate. There are groans of ecstasy. There are few more sensual scenes than a party of young and old sitting around gorging themselves on durians, faces splattered with the fruit's golden flesh, seeds licked as clean as marbles. Hew Choy Sam has a durian orchard in the Malaysian state of Perak. A founder member of Malaysia's first durian growers association, Hew is a self confessed durian addict. 'There is something very strange about durians. Just put two of them on a stall by the road and everyone wants to stop and smell and chat. People are obsessed with them: they search all their lives for the perfect one.' There are heated arguments over where the best durians come from. Thailand is the biggest producer. But Malaysians say the Thais have allowed durian production to become too commercial. Thai durians keep longer because they are harvested while still hanging on the tree. Hew says durians must be allowed to drop. Only then is the flesh guaranteed moist and ripe. 'The Thais are even trying to produce an odourless durian so it can be exported,' says an indignant Hew. 'You can't take the smell out of durians. For us it is nearly as important as the taste.' A terrible vision of eating Hurley's socks comes to mind. Durians are temperamental fruits which are easily infected by pests and disease. They also command premium prices - a good, highly pungent durian full of fleshy seeds can fetch up to MDollars 40 (Pounds 10). There are durian cowboys who sell dud durians to unsuspecting customers. Durian rustling is common. During harvesting season Hew, a sprightly 65-year-old, moves his bed out to his orchard to guard his crop. 'Through the night I count the thuds as durians hit the ground. It is a lovely sound.' Hew and his friends think nothing of driving hundreds of miles in search of the perfect durian. Fruits are tasted with the same diligence as wines are sipped at a French auction. The durian has its own mythology. It aids circulation but increases blood pressure. It is good for the complexion but causes gout. It must never be eaten with alcohol. It is an aphrodisiac but also creates chronic wind. When the durian tree has finished dispensing its smelly pleasures to the world the wood is used for making clogs. An ideal present for Hurley.</p>

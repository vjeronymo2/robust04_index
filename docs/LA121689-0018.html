			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SAVANNA GIRLS' BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> OCEAN VIEW ACCEPTS MISSION VIEJO'S OFFER IN TIME FOR 56-51 VICTORY  </P> <P> For about three quarters Friday night, the Ocean View High School girls'  basketball team tried to force the ball inside to 6-foot-3 center Jennifer  Sullivan during the championship game of the Savanna Runnin' Rebel tournament.  </P> <P> Not a bad plan considering Sullivan, last season's most valuable player in the  Sunset League, scored 28 points in a semifinal victory over Redlands.  </P> <P> But Mission Viejo was sagging its zone all over Sullivan, almost sending the  Seahawk guards an engraved invitation to shoot.  </P> <P> For the better part of the game the invitation seemed to have been lost in the  mail.  </P> <P> It wasn't until Ocean View guard Alli Takido hit two three-point shots late in  the third quarter and early in the fourth, that the Seahawks (6-0) were able to  pull away for a 56-51 victory.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo trailed, 34-28, but cut the deficit to 34-32 with a minute left  in the third quarter. That's when Takido hit her first three-point shot to give  Ocean View a 37-32 lead.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo then outscored Ocean View, 8-4, on four baskets by Jennifer  Rohrig to trail, 41-40, with about five minutes to play.  </P> <P> Again, Takido sank a three-point shot to put Ocean View ahead, 44-40, and take  the momentum out of Mission Viejo's comeback.  </P> <P> Takido knew the Ocean View guards had been having an off night right before she  hit her first three-point shot. "I was just thinking I have to start shooting  more. The first one was just at the buzzer and I felt good, so I just fired it  up," she said.  </P> <P> "That opened it up a lot more for Tracy (Wolfe) and Jenny, and we have to do  that because they can really pour it on when they have some room to work."  </P> <P> Sullivan made space for herself early with 11 rebounds, many on the offensive  end. She scored 24 points, on 12-of-23 shooting, and blocked 10 shots, and was  named the tournament most valuable player. Wolfe (11 points) and Takido (12  points) also made the all-tournament team, along with Rohrig, who finished with  24 points, and Carrie Burt (12 points) of Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> In other Savanna tournament games:  </P> <P> Edison 46, Canyon Springs 34 -- Erika Miller scored 13 and Debbie Fischer added  11 to lead Edison to the consolation championship.  </P> <P> Redlands 62, Loara 38 -- Trina Swiontek had 21 points to lead Redlands (6-1) to  a third-place tournament finish. Jennifer Leonard scored 22 for Loara (2-5),  which was without center and leading scorer Traci Titus (sprained ankle).  </P> <P> Savanna 65, Fullerton 49 -- Carrie Frederick scored 20 points for Savanna (5-3)  in the fifth-place game. Jennifer Comstock led Fullerton (6-2) with 15 points.  </P></p>

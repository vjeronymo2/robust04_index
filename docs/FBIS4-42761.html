			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping by Alfred </F> Merta and Friedemann Weckbach-Mara; place and date not given:  "Scharping -- Everybody Makes Mistakes"]    [Text] [BILD AM SONNTAG] You have been fiercely attacked  for your reaction to Roman Herzog's election as president. Do  you, meanwhile, believe that you made a mistake?    [Scharping] We criticized the standards of the elections,  not the person elected. Roman Herzog has a right to  cooperation; but even the FDP's [Free Democratic Party] Ms.  Hamm-Bruecher spoke of "power calculations." I was angry at  first, but everybody makes mistakes. Today I see things more  calmly.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] Yet SPD Minister-Presidents Schroeder and  Stolpe strongly criticized you in public. Are you going to  strike back?    [Scharping] These two must not be lumped together. One  person clearing his throat does not mean that the whole SPD  [Social Democratic Party of Germany] suffers from pneumonia.  Every Social Democrat must contribute to the election victory  instead of acting out their personal vanities.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] Strong words, when will they be followed  by actions?    [Scharping] At its party conference on 22 June, the SPD will  present a solid picture and will clearly support me. And we  will adopt a convincing government program.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] What will it say?    [Scharping] Among the things we want are a cut in government  costs and a modern state. The number of ministries will be cut  from 19 to 15 or 16, and of the 60 state secretaries, some 40  will remain in office. We want to introduce reforms in public  service regulations. Public servants will only perform tasks  such as police, inland revenue, and judiciary functions. The  top positions in the public service will be temporary ones.  Salaries for young, qualified persons starting a vocation will  be higher from the beginning. We will weed out the system of  grades of seniority drastically. There must be more competition  in public services, including privatization, as long as this  does not mean a deterioration in quality. The number of  regulations and approvals needed, say in building, must be  reduced significantly. In a nutshell: The Kohl policy of  constantly increasing taxes and quickly growing debts will be  over. This requires an efficient state.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] Opinion polls indicate that you have lost  a great deal of support. Is there still a chance that you will  win the Bundestag elections and put your program into practice?    [Scharping] Serious polls show that we are still the  strongest party. And I am clearly in the lead ahead of Mr.  Kohl. The European elections on 12 June and the Saxony-Anhalt  Landtag elections will be further indicators.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] But you will need a coalition partner in  Bonn. The FDP has clearly decided in favor of the Union  [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union], thus giving  the SPD the brush-off. Does this mean that there will be a  red-green coalition after all?    [Scharping] No. Our position is clear and it will not  change: We want to be the strongest party. This way we will  always find a partner. We are ruling out a grand coalition.  The FDP did not say that it will join the Union as an  opposition party if the elections turn out unfavorably for them.  This means that after the elections the supply of partners will  be greater than the demand. But there is one thing that I will  not grant: exclusive rights for small parties. This way the  tail would wag the dog. The only way things will change in  Germany is if the SPD wins a majority.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] Who shall be part of the SPD government?    [Scharping] We will present our cabinet team after the  summer recess. I have talked to several people. And I have  always made sure that governments include people from outside  politics, as is the case in Rhineland-Palatinate.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] Will you establish a reconstruction  ministry?    [Scharping] I will personally look after reconstruction in  eastern Germany. And I hope I will be able to get Wolfgang  Thierse to coordinate this, perhaps in the Chancellor's Office.  The share of east Germans in government will be higher than it  is now.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] Would Chancellor Scharping prescribe a  130-km speed limit on all German highways?    [Scharping] On most highways. But there will be exceptions.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] There have been voices in your party  calling for a ban on the Republikaner. Are you in favor of such  a ban?    [Scharping] I am in favor of having them observed closely by  the Office for the Protection of the Constitution. This has  turned out to be successful over the past few months. The  Republikaner have been unmasked. We must succeed in keeping  them out of all parliaments.</p>

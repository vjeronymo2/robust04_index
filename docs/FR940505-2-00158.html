			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``1. Eligibility for consideration under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) is triggered only by an amendment listed in subsection (c) that lowers the applicable guideline range. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. In determining the amended guideline range under subsection (b), the court shall substitute only the amendments listed in subsection (c) for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced. All other guideline application decisions remain unaffected.''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commentary to &sect;1B1.10 captioned ``Background'' is amended in the last paragraph by deleting ``subsection (d)'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``subsection (c)''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reason for Amendment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This amendment revises &sect;1B1.10 to substantially simplify its operation. Under this amendment, the court will recalculate the guideline range using only those amendments expressly designated as retroactive. In addition, this amendment deletes current &sect;1B1.10(c), a rather complex subsection, as an unnecessary restriction on the court's consideration of a revised sentence in response to an amended guideline range. Finally, this amendment makes a number of minor clarifying revisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 3.

The Commission has determined that the extension of the Drug Quantity Table above level 38 for quantity itself is not required to ensure adequate punishment given that organizers, leaders, managers, and supervisors of such offenses will receive a 4-, 3-, or 2-level enhancement for their role in the offense, and any participant will receive an additional 2-level enhancement if a dangerous weapon is possessed in the offense. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 4. Amendment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commentary to &sect;4B1.1 captioned ``Application Notes'' is amended in Note 2 by deleting the first sentence and inserting in lieu thereof: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

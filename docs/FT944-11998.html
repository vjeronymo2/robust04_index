			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Tele-Cine Cell to join market with Pounds 20m tag Shares in Tele-Cine Cell have been priced at 170p, valuing the Soho-based group at Pounds 20m. The video editing and special effects group whose recent projects have included Guinness's 'glass universe' commercial, is coming to market via a placing of 4.7m shares, representing 40 per cent of the expanded capital. Half the shares are being sold by existing shareholders including the group's joint managing directors, Mr John Rowland and Mr Paul O'Hagan, who will each retain a 13.5 per cent stake. They will make a little more than Pounds 900,000 each and Mr John Graves, co-founder of Tele-Cine, will receive about Pounds 2.2m. The remaining 2.25m shares are being issued by the group to raise Pounds 4m new funds. This will be used to reduce borrowings and provide working capital. The group is divided into two main businesses, both of which operate in fast growing high-technology markets. Tele-Cine undertakes film transfer, video editing and sound mixing, together with tape transfer, standards conversion and archiving. Cell uses motion control filming, 3D computer graphics and digital editing systems to create special effects sequences. The group continued to grow organically through the recession and capital expenditure has amounted to Pounds 8.3m in the last 3 1/2 years. Last year the group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1m (Pounds 778,000) on turnover of Pounds 9.69m (Pounds 8.1m). Profits grew to Pounds 1.28m in the six months to June 30 on turnover of Pounds 6.19m. Directors have forecast full-year pre-tax profits of not less than Pounds 2.2m. On the basis of the forecast earnings per share for the year the flotation price represents a prospective multiple of 11.8. Dealings are expected to begin on November 10.</p>

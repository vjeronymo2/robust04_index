			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 12 May (AFP) -- The armed opposition  Democratic Front for Renewal [FDR], in a communique released  here yesterday, has called for the institution in Niger of a  federal system that will bring together all Nigerois. The FDR  said that it has "undertaken to resolutely pursue the political  and military struggle until all vestiges of this disastrous  system -- the present system in Niger -- have been completely  stamped out." The communique, which was signed by Mamane  Kodelami Ali, a representative of this movement, adds: "With the  advent of the ruling Alliance of Forces of Change, which  supports President Mahamane Ousmane, the people of Niger are  seeing their hopes crumble like a house of cards."    The FDR, which is based in the Lake Chad region, accused the  present regime of "corruption, favoritism, lies, wastage, and  the deliberate alteration of democracy." The FDR's program  proposes to cut up Niger into regions, with a federal status in  conformity with the geographical and social realities, in order  to ensure stability in the country.</p>

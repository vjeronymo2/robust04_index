			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONFRONTING THE REAL LATIN CRISIS  </P> <P> The first problem Latin America presents to the Bush Administration is  identification of the true problem. The Reagan Administration devoted itself to  all the wrong problems, for which it paid a considerable price in U.S.  credibility and international respect. Can George Bush's people do better?  </P> <P> Ask the State Department specialists responsible for Latin America how they  spent their time during the Reagan years. They will answer that 80% of their  energy was devoted to Nicaragua and 20% to all the rest. Secretary of State  James A. Baker III got examined mostly on Nicaragua, El Salvador and Cuba  during his confirmation-hearing questioning on Latin America. Argentina, whose  democratic government is under grave and growing challenge, was not a subject  of notable interest.  </P> <P> El Salvador, Nicaragua and Cuba have for months, even years, dominated press  discussion of Latin America. A crisis currently is predicted for El Salvador,  where a presidential election takes place in March, with poor prospects for the  U.S.-backed Christian Democrats. The left-wing guerrilla movement is bidding  for a truce and a role in the election.  </P> <P> But is crisis in El Salvador necessarily a crisis for the United States?  Washington worries about communists and death squads, matters of certain  concern to the Salvadorans, who must live with the consequences of their  electoral -- and extra-electoral -- choices. But El Salvador's problems are not  the fundamental problems of Latin America.  </P> <P> El Salvador's Marxism, like that of the Sandinistas next door in Nicaragua,  represents an ideological dead end for Latin America -- just as Castroism does.  Romantic middle-class Marxism is an outdated and increasingly irrelevant  response to cultural and structural problems in Latin America. The  ideologically unclassifiable, cult-like "Shining Path" in Peru is much more up  to date and a great deal more sinister. So are the drug barons -- feeding, and  fed by, North American drug addiction.  </P> <P> Fundamentally, Latin America confronts the political consequences of its  absolutist cultural inheritance, as well as an urgent economic crisis. The  cultural issue is unresolvable as such, being the historical condition with  which Latin Americans live. But it needs to be confronted nonetheless. The  Latin American intellectual and religious tradition is absolutist, intolerant,  unpragmatic -- a constant obstacle to compromise and political reforms.  </P> <P> The imperialism that populated and culturally shaped Latin American society,  destroying the Indian civilizations already there, was peculiarly  uncompromising, motivated by the search for gold and a search for souls. Spain  and Portugal, at the peak of their powers in the 16th Century, failed to make a  creative adaptation to the modern world that followed. Their American colonies  could do no better. The Enlightenment and the social revolutions of the 19th  Century passed them by. They walled themselves off from modernity, reemerging  only in the 1960s and '70s.  </P> <P> The United States has refused to leave the region alone, even though unable to  influence it to become something more congenial in Protestant and progressive  North American eyes. Washington has really never known what it wanted of the  Latin Americans. "I am going to teach the South American republics to elect  good men," said Woodrow Wilson in 1914. But who would have been these "good  men" in Wilson's eyes?  </P> <P> Latin America's economic crisis follows in part from its inability to repay the  debt enthusiastically pressed upon it during the 1970s, when American and West  European banks needed to recycle the OPEC nations' windfall dollars. Virtually  no one today contests that the debt is unrepayable, but the Western countries  insist on a mechanism to disguise this fact and avoid such hard words as  default and bankruptcy.  </P> <P> The unrepayable loans are a problem for the banks that made the loans,  certainly, and finding an adroit way to write off the money is important to the  stability of the international banking system. But this is a frivolous problem  compared to that faced by economically failing societies, which cannot borrow  more because they cannot repay past loans, yet have to go on feeding people,  investing to develop agriculture, investing to build the infrastructure that  makes future development imaginable. What do they do? There is no Baker plan to  solve their problems.  </P> <P> In the West, the tendency has been to shrug these considerations off as,  generally, the Third World's worry. Alternatively they are held to be problems  so awful that nothing can be done about them. This might even work for Japan  and the West Europeans, because they are real or virtual islands, cut off from  the Third World. The United States is not so lucky in this respect, if luck is  the word.  </P> <P> The United States has an unshuttable land and sea border on Latin America. It  simply can't treat Latin American economics as a private-sector problem. It  can't treat Latin American politics as an ideological problem -- or a military  one. If Latin America's problems are not dealt with in Latin America, on  realistic terms, then Latin Americans are going to come to the United States  looking for their solutions. The United States is the one rich nation in a  position to have the poverty-stricken of the world beating down its doors,  looking for answers.  </P></p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Swedish bank aid attacked Sweden's private-sector banks yesterday issued a strong protest to the government over the extent of state aid for Nordbanken, one of the hardest-hit victims of the recent Nordic banking crisis. The bank has shot back to profits since the state took over most of its bad loans. In a letter to the Bank Support Authority, the Riksbank and the financial inspection authorities, the Swedish Bankers' Association said the terms of the bail-out for state-owned Nordbanken had given the bank an unreasonable competitive advantage over rivals which had not had loan-loss or balance sheet problems laundered by the state. The association, led by Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Svenska Handelsbanken, the leading commercial banks which did not receive direct state aid, said the state should ultimately claw back the SKr90bn (Dollars 11.25bn) it has pledged to ailing banks. Nordbanken has been the biggest beneficiary of the state rescue operation. Bad loans worth SKr67bn were taken off its books and put into a state-run company called Securum, which itself was capitalised through a SKr35bn state injection. Nordbanken then received more than SKr16bn in capital from the government to keep it solvent. It has meanwhile become Sweden's biggest bank by market share after taking over Gota Bank, another state-owned crisis victim. Gota has swallowed some SKr30bn in aid and been relieved of bad loans worth SKr43bn. The operation has left Nordbanken the most profitable Swedish bank. It is expected to report a profit after loan losses in 1993 of around SKr3bn.</p>

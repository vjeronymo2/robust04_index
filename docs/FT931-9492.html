			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Cupid may seek cash injection CUPID has not had the run-up to Valentine's Day that it might have wished in terms of sales, but the bridal wear group's attractions to a group of new investors are expect-ed to lead to a cash inject-ion. An announcement is expected soon about the fund raising, which is likely to involve some individual equity investors. The move might be linked to board appointments. The USM-quoted company warned yesterday that it would make 'a substantial loss' for the year to March 31. This comes only two months after it said pre-tax profits would be no more than last year's Pounds 867,000. The share price has been hitting new lows ever since and yesterday shed another 3p to close at 35p. The December warning was accompanied by news of the resignation of the founder, Mr Michael Murray, as chief executive after a disagreement with the rest of the board. Mr Richard Lee, chairman, has taken on the role temporarily, leading a review of the business. As a result, activities are being concentrated on two sites instead of five. The head office is being moved from Accrington to the main factory in Blackburn. The cost of these cuts is one reason for the company falling into the red. The other is that sales of bridal wear and nursery products have fallen below budget in the crucial last quarter of the year. If there is another equity issue it will be the third in little more than two years. Last June a 1-for-2 rights issue, priced at 82p a share, raised Pounds 2.68m. However, more than 80 per cent was left with the underwriters. The proceeds helped ease net debt of Pounds 4.2m - gearing of 93 per cent - built up partly through the acquisition of the Youngs formal wear business. In December 1990 the acquisition of the Pronuptia retail chain was accompanied by a placing and offer which doubled the equity. Cupid's share price peaked at 143p in July 1989, shortly before it moved up from the Third Market to the USM. It also rose to more than 120p ahead of last June's rights.</p>

Seven of those centers belong to Renamo and the  other six to the government.    According to the UN Operations in Mozambique's [Unomoz]  daily  report, two of those Renamo assembly areas -- (Mohila), in  Zambezia Province, and Chiramba, in Sofala Province -- currently  have more than double the forces initially supposed to stay  there.

Of those,  some 27,000 are government soldiers and more than 10,600 are  Renamo troops.</p>

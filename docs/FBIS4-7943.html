			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 6 (CTK) -- Former Slovak Premier  Vladimir Meciar today accused the chairmen of the Democratic  Left Party (SDL) and of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH),  Peter Weiss and Jan Carnogursky respectively, of attempts to  renew the joint Czech-Slovak state.    Meciar was speaking at a meeting of his Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) which was marked with strong  criticism of President Michal Kovac and especially of Jozef  Moravcik's government.    Meciar said that "Peter Weiss is playing a big game going  beyond the borders of his party, and this even at the cost of  the SDL's disintegration," Meciar said referring to the  unsuccessful talks between the HZDS and the SDL on the formation  of a coalition government before Meciar's government fell on  March 11.    Meciar claimed that during his meeting with President Bill  Clinton last year, Carnogursky presented a three-point plan  aimed at disintegration of the HZDS with the help of Milan  Knazko (fired by Meciar from the post of foreign minister in  March 1993), to be followed by the restoration of Czechoslovakia.    Meciar also said that present Premier Jozef Moravcik and  Deputy Premier Roman Kovac "would have had to leave the  government because they had made gross mistakes." Moravcik was  foreign minister and Kovac held the same post as now.    Meciar today accused both of them of inactivity and of  telling lies. "In the material which he had prepared for me  before my trip to Rome, Moravcik called the Vatican the center  of ideological subversion," Meciar said.</p>

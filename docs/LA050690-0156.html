			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF;  </P> <P> 400 IN FIELD FOR STATE AMATEUR QUALIFYING MAY 15-16 IN CHINO  </P> <P> The road to Pebble Beach for the 79th California Amateur Championship will go  through Los Serranos Country Club in Chino -- as it has for the past 20 years  -- for golfers from Southern California.  </P> <P> A record 517 low-handicap golfers filed entries for the tournament from the  southern half of the state, a number that the Southern California Golf Assn.  had to pare to 400 to accommodate the two Los Serranos courses where qualifying  will be held May 15-16.  </P> <P> On the first day, half the field will play the 7,110-yard, par-74 South Course,  and the other 200 will play the 6,200-yard, par-71 North Course.  </P> <P> The fields will be cut to the low 50 and ties for the second round, with the  players switching courses. After 36 holes, the low 43 will receive invitations  to play June 25 at Cypress Point in the first round of the State Amateur.  Actually, there will be 50 from Southern California, but there are seven  exemptions. Another 50 from Northern California will complete the field.  </P> <P> Paul Stankowski, the Southern California Amateur champion from Oxnard, heads  the list of players who have exemptions. Others are Dave Stockton Jr. of  Mentone, runner-up in last year's State Amateur; Mark Johnson of Barstow, the  SCGA Mid-Amateur champion, and the others who reached the quarterfinals last  year -- Jack Spradlin Jr. of San Diego, Pat Duncan of Rancho Santa Fe and Craig  Steinberg of Van Nuys. Another spot will be held open for the NCAA champion, in  case he is from Southern California, as was Phil Mickelson of La Jolla last  year.  </P> <P> Bob Pastore, the SCGA senior champion from San Diego, also had an exemption but  declined.  </P> <P> Defending champion is Casey Boyns of Pacific Grove, a caddy at Pebble Beach,  who defeated Stockton, a USC student and son of former two-time PGA champion  Dave Stockton, 3 and 1. The elder Stockton was recently named captain of the  United States Ryder Cup team, which will meet a European team next year at  Kiawah Island, S.C.  </P> <P> Players will find a number of minor changes on the North Course at Los  Serranos, which is owned by former tennis star Jack Kramer. One they won't  find, however, is that No. 9 has been changed from a 217-yard par-3 to a  345-yard par-4.  </P> <P> Officials of the SCGA ruled Friday that qualifying rounds would be played with  the old hole, reasoning that the change would confuse players who had practiced  under the par-3, par-71 format.  </P> <P> "No. 9 was a monster, especially when the wind was blowing," said Kevin  Sullivan, manager of the Los Serranos Golf Club courses. "It was a backbreaker  that hardly anyone reached. Now, it is a much fairer hole and will give the  course a par-72 rating. It isn't long, but it has a two-level green and is well  protected by three traps around the green and three more on the fairway."  </P> <P> The State Amateur will conclude on June 29 with a 36-hole championship final at  Pebble Beach.  </P> <P> The American Golf Club, a 50,000-member organization that is based in Santa  Monica and has the largest membership of any golf club in the country, is  planning its own national scrambles team championship.  </P> <P> Qualifying tournaments will be held at the more than 100 courses operated by  American Golf Corp. Included are Long Beach's five municipal courses, Brookside  in Pasadena, Camarillo Springs, Fullerton, Oceanside, Rancho San Joaquin in  Irvine, Vista Valencia and Los Angeles County courses at La Mirada, Los Verdes  and Mountain Meadows.  </P> <P> American Golf is also negotiating to take over operation of the Knollwood  county course in Granada Hills.  </P> <P> Once the four-player teams are established, 13 regional tournaments will be  held around the country. Southern Californians will play at Brookside,  Oceanside or El Dorado in Long Beach. The finals will be Nov. 17-19 at the  Painted Desert course in Las Vegas. Two teams will qualify from each regional  tournament.  </P> <P> Players need not be American Golf Club members to participate in the event.  Entry fees are $30 for members, $40 for non-members.  </P> <P> Golf Notes  </P> <P> The late Alan Hale was a familiar figure at the Griffith Park courses for many  years and was one of the municipal club's most popular members. Friends of the  former actor are planning a memorial tournament in his honor on May 17 at the  nine-hole Roosevelt course. Hale, best known for his role as the skipper in  Gilligan's Island, died of cancer, and receipts will go toward cancer research,  according to Tom Barber, Griffith Park professional and tournament chairman.  For $15, players will get nine holes of scrambles golf, a clinic and a chance  to reminisce about their old pal.  </P> <P> Security Pacific Bank has signed a three-year agreement with Centinela Hospital  Medical Center to sponsor the Los Angeles Senior PGA tournament at Rancho Park.  The $500,000 event will include a two-day pro-am Oct. 31-Nov. 1 to benefit the  hospital's Children's Charity Fund, and a 54-hole tournament Nov. 2-4. . . .  The Women's SCGA will hold its 32nd annual Desert Championships Monday and  Tuesday on the Bermuda Dunes, Eldorado, Tamarisk, Thunderbird and Vintage  courses. . . . The 54-hole $50,000 Riverside County Open will begin Wednesday  at Rancho California CC.  </P> <P> Entries will close Friday for the 67th Los Angeles City Women's Championship  May 22-24 at Rancho Park. Teri Melanson is defending champion. . . . Chris  Tidland, the Valencia High golfer who won the L. A. City junior title, plans to  enroll at Oklahoma State after graduating next month. . . . The U.S. National  Senior Open Golf Assn. will hold its 20th annual spring championship May 15-17  at Mission Hills, Palm Valley and Monterey CC.

The Bob Hope USO charity tournament will be played on May 14 at the Los  Alamitos Naval Air Station course. . . . Millie Stanley successfully defended  her Wilshire CC women's championship with a 72-77-78-75 -- 302.  </P> <P> The number of golfers in the country has increased from 23.4 million to 24.7  million, a 5.6% jump, since 1988, according to the National Golf Foundation.  However, the number of rounds played dropped from 487 million to 474 million. .  . . Larry Gage, president of the Anchorage Golf Assn., writes to report that  golfers in Alaska are now using the slope system for handicapping -- leaving  only Augusta National outside the fold.  </P> <P> The Spalding Invitational Pro-Am will return to the Monterey Peninsula in  December after a one-year stay at Scottsdale, Ariz. Chairman Harold Firstman  said the tournament, which includes pros from both the PGA Tour and the LPGA  Tour, will be played in December on the Pebble Beach, Spyglass Hill and Poppy  Hills courses.  </P></p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Flyers should also smarten up Sir, For once I agree wholeheartedly with Clement Crisp ('The decline and fall of elegance', July 18). I also think the scheme proposed by Mr David Sawers (Letters, July 22) could also be applied to airline passengers, but perhaps without the evening dress - although this is far preferable to the vests, shorts and training shoes now regularly in evidence.

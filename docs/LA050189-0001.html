			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A baby eagle named Suzanne was fed a trout over the weekend by an adult bald  eagle, that wildlife biologists hope will adopt the fledgling and help  reestablish a colony in Southern California. The 3-week-old chick, taken from a  nest in Northern California Thursday, was placed in the nest of a pair of  eagles on Santa Catalina Island Friday morning. After several hours the female  adult landed and began feeding the fledgling, said biologist David Garcelon.  The young bird won't be able to fly for about 10 weeks. Previous eggs laid by  the female eagle, introduced to the island habitat in 1980, had failed to hatch  because pesticide contamination weakened their shells. Bald eagles disappeared  from the island in the 1950s, victims of pollution and egg poachers.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SDG&amp;E SURVEY CLAIMS VOTERS WOULD REJECT A PUBLIC TAKEOVER  </P> <P> If an election were held today, two out of three San Diego County residents  would probably vote against a takeover of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric by the  San Diego County Water Authority, according to a survey released Monday by  SDG&amp;E.  </P> <P> According to the poll, conducted in early January by the San Francisco-based  Field Research Corp., 66% of the county's residents would also prefer that the  local utility remain a privately owned company rather than become a government  agency.  </P> <P> The poll, which cost $75,000 and evidently marks the start of an SDG&amp;E  campaign aimed at stopping a government takeover, drew a harsh response from  critics of the proposed merger between SDG&amp;E and Edison.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Keeping It in SDG&amp;E's Arena  </P> <P> San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor claimed that "the only real poll that will  count is when we put it to the vote of the people. . . . (The utilities) don't  want it to go to a vote of the people. They want to keep it in the arena they  control." O'Connor spokesman Paul Downey claimed that Field's "methodology is  suspect because (pollsters) never mentioned the word Edison. They never once  mentioned the proposed merger."  </P> <P> SDG&amp;E spokeswoman Karen Hutchens maintained that the poll's validity was  not affected by the decision to avoid questions on the proposed merger between  SDG&amp;E and Edison. The proposed merger "is a separate issue" from the  government takeover, Hutchens said.  </P> <P> Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers Action Network, on  Monday described the poll as premature.  </P> <P> "The public is not going to be hot on buying a utility unless it makes economic  sense, and no one has proved that yet," Shames said. "SDG&amp;E wasted  $75,000."  </P> <P> UCAN members, Shames said, have made it clear that they are not going to  support a merger or a takeover unless someone proves that it is going to save  them money. "That's the critical point, and SDG&amp;E ignored it."  </P> <P> State Assemblyman Larry Stirling, who is preparing legislation to allow a vote  of the people on a takeover, on Monday argued that the poll was not valid  because SDG&amp;E "posed a false question."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Ought to Be Told the Whole Truth'  </P> <P> Voters "ought to be told the whole truth . . . that by and large rates are  lower under municipal ownership than they are under investor ownership,"  Stirling said.  </P> <P> SDG&amp;E, which has pledged to oppose a government takeover of its business,  plans to publicize results of the poll, beginning with full-page newspaper  advertisements that appeared this morning in local newspapers. The  advertisements include a clip-out coupon that encourages readers to register  their opposition to a "government takeover of SDG&amp;E." Shareholders of the  local utility paid $75,000 for the poll, Hutchens said.  </P> <P> Nearly half of the 803 respondents who completed the lengthy telephone poll  said they would oppose a $3-billion bond issue to finance an acquisition of  SDG&amp;E by the CWA. About 25% said they would support a bond issue, and the  rest had no opinion.  </P> <P> However, the CWA has yet to indicate what level of financing would be required  to acquire SDG&amp;E, and Field did not fully explain why the $3-billion figure  was used in the poll.  </P></p>

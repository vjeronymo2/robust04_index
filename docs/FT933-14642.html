			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: More PC price cuts at Apple APPLE Computer yesterday announced further cuts in the US prices of several of its personal computer products. The move followed reductions in May and June, as the company, which last week announced deep job cuts, struggles to maintain its sales momentum amid an industry-wide price war. The latest round of price cuts applies to Apple's popular Powerbook notebook computers as well as its highest performance Macintosh Quadra models. In addition, Apple expanded a rebate promotion to cover the Performa product line, which is aimed primarily at individual buyers rather than companies. 'The price reductions, and the Performa rebates, are part of our overall company strategy to take aggressive actions in order to increase our market share,' said Mr Bob Puette, president of Apple USA. 'With these actions, we are making some of our most popular products more competitive.' Apple reduced the US price of its Macintosh Quadra 950 systems by up to 29 per cent and also cut the price of its recently introduced workgroup server computers by up to 20 per cent. Powerbook prices have been reduced by seven to 34 per cent. Buyers of Apple's Macintosh Performa PCs will receive cash rebates of Dollars 100 to Dollars 200. Despite the price cuts, Apple's share of the world PC market is stagnating, according to industry analysts, and the company's profit margins have declined. In a move to boost profits the company said last week that it would lay off 2,500 people, or more than 15 per cent of its worldwide workforce, over the next 12 months. Most of the job cuts are due to occur this month. Apple has also frozen pay increases for all employees for an indefinite period, and the company's top executives must take a 5 per cent pay cut, the company said. Mr Michael Spindler, Apple president, who was promoted to chief executive officer last month, has declined to make any comment on the cost cutting moves. Mr John Sculley, who remains chairman of the company, is on sabbatical.</p>

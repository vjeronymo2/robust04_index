			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ilya Bulavinov report in the "Russian-U.S. Military </F> Cooperation" column: "Pavel Grachev Finds the Exercises a Hard  Test"]    [Text] The cancellation of Russian-U.S. military exercises  in Orenburg Oblast can damage both Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev's international prestige and his positions within  Russia. Whether the exercises in Orenburg Oblast will go ahead  after all may become clear at the end of consultations of  Russian and U.S. military working groups which opened in Moscow  yesterday.    The noise around the exercises is in fact of an exclusively  political character. It is hard to believe that the tent camp  which was to be made for 210 Americans on the territory of the  27th Motorized Division stationed in the area of Totsk can cause  irreparable ecological damage. Likewise it is hard to see the  presence of 200 men and officers from the U.S. Army as a real  threat to Russia's national security.    Apparently State Duma deputies, protesting against the  conduct of joint exercises, have decided to use the planned  one-week presence of the U.S. military on Russia's territory for  far more serious purposes.    What is at issue is apparently the figure of the defense  minister himself. First of all, because many deputies cannot  forgive him the tanks on Krasnopresnenskaya Naberezhnaya last  October. Furthermore, anyone from the presidential entourage is  a "red rag" to the opposition. Especially a power minister.  Pavel Grachev's political independence and influence seem no  longer to suit not only the opposition but even some people in  the presidential team. Even such a presidential structure as  the Security Council has come out against the minister on the  side of the State Duma. As KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned, the  council apparatus has prepared a memorandum for Boris Yeltsin  that talks about the inexpediency of inviting the Americans to  Russia.    Meanwhile, for Pavel Grachev, who likes to accentuate his  successes in relations with "distant foreign lands," the first  Russian-U.S. exercises on Russian soil were to mark not only a  transition to a new stage of cooperation with the United States.  They were to consolidate his image as a serious politician,  capable of pursuing an independent line. Cancellation of the  exercises can damage the minister's authority with foreign  colleagues and put into question the durability of his position  in the upper echelons of the Russian power structure. To be  sure, this will not force the defense minister to resign. Yet  it is just as obvious that the first crack in his status will  appear. If Pavel Grachev fails to defend the idea of joint  maneuvers, this will indicate that the general, who is part of  the presidential inner circle, is not so influential and  invulnerable after all, and will increase the opposition's wish  to knock a strong figure from the presidential team. Therefore  it can be assumed that criticism over the maneuvers will be  followed by more serious attacks.    It is also noteworthy that almost at the same time an attack  was launched on another power minister, also close to the  president: Viktor Yerin. When discussing the assassination of  Andrey Ayzderzis, deputies demanded Yerin's resignation.    Presumably, taught by bitter experience, the president's  opponents are now afraid of attacking him directly. They  undertake a bypassing maneuver, trying to shake Boris Yeltsin's  main props. Surely, the likelihood that he will soon replace the  proven power ministers is negligible. By discrediting people  close to the president step by step, however, the opposition can  finally compel Yeltsin to part with them. Moreover, the  president's opponents do not even need to place their people in  the vacant posts: After all the new figures, even if appointed  by Yeltsin himself, will hardly strengthen him.</p>

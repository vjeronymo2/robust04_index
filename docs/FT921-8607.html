			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Bush heads for comfortable win in primary poll A CONFIDENT President George Bush yesterday launched a last-minute drive to win over uncommitted voters in New Hampshire as his campaign chairman predicted a comfortable victory over Mr Patrick Buchanan, his rightwing Republican opponent, in tomorrow's primary election. With polls showing Mr Bush holding a surprisingly strong lead, the White House dismissed fears that Mr Buchanan would embarrass the president in this recession-hit New England state, enabling him to continue his campaign. Mr Robert Teeter, Bush campaign chairman, said there was no evidence that Mr Bush was in trouble. 'He will win, and he will win comfortably,' Mr Teeter insisted. Mr Buchanan, a television commentator and former speech writer to presidents Nixon and Reagan, preaches an 'America first' message which leans toward protectionism and isolationism. According to the latest Boston Globe poll, Mr Bush, with 54 per cent, holds a 28-point lead over Mr Buchanan. Most experts believe the challenger needs at least 35 per cent to maintain a credible campaign in the up-coming primaries in the south next month. The president, who drew small, politely enthusiastic crowds during two days of late scheduled campaigning at the weekend, took the high road yesterday. He avoided attacks on his opponent and promised an upturn in the US economy. 'Housing and real estate are going to lead the recovery,' he told an audience yesterday. In the Democratic race, former senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts basked in his new position as the front runner, maintaining a clear lead over Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the previous favourite who has been damaged by unsubstantiated charges of adultery and draft-dodging. Mr Clinton's slide has provoked a scramble among the other Democratic candidates whose survival depends on a second or third place showing in tomorrow's primary, the first of the 1992 election campaign. Last night, all five Democrats were preparing for a televised debate in Manchester. Political experts predict a heavy turn out in New Hampshire which has a tradition of election upsets and come-from-behind wins such as Mr Bush's victory here in 1988. This unpredictability is compounded by the economic troubles in the state which has gone from boom to bust since Mr Bush took office in 1989. Tax plans countered, Page 2</p>

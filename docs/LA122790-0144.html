			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PENNZOIL UPS CHEVRON STAKE AFTER IRS ACTS;  </P> <P> ENERGY: IT NOW OWNS 9.4% OF THE OIL GIANT, SPENDING A TOTAL OF $2.1 BILLION OF  ITS COURT SETTLEMENT WITH TEXACO.  </P> <P> Pennzoil Co. said Wednesday that it had increased its stake in Chevron Corp.  after the Internal Revenue Service granted a five-month extension for Pennzoil  to invest proceeds from its 1988 court settlement with Texaco Inc.  </P> <P> Pennzoil spent $2.1 billion of a net $2.6-billion settlement in 1989 to  purchase 31.5 million common shares of Chevron, giving it 9% ownership in the  company.  </P> <P> In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington, Pennzoil  said that as of Wednesday it owned 32.8 million shares -- about 9.4% of the  350.8 million shares outstanding.  </P> <P> Pennzoil said 1.27 million of those 32.8 million shares were purchased during  the past 60 days on the New York Stock Exchange at an average price of $69.75  per share.  </P> <P> In July, Pennzoil notified the Federal Trade Commission of its intent to  increase its ownership level to slightly under 10% by purchasing additional  Chevron shares.  </P> <P> Pennzoil said it needed the extension from the IRS because of delays in  obtaining clearance from the FTC, which monitors business activity that is  considered potentially anti-competitive.  </P> <P> Under the IRS delay, Pennzoil said, the company now has until May 31 to invest  proceeds from its historic 1988 Texaco litigation settlement.  </P></p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Halifax urges intervention HALIFAX, Britain's largest building society, is calling for government intervention in the housing market to avert the need for 'crisis measures' next year. The level of housing activity is 'abnormally low' and demand for houses needs to increase for there to be a housing recovery, Halifax says. The government, it says, should take measures to stimulate the housing sector including: Cutting interest rates to 6 per cent to 7 per cent. Raising mortgage interest tax relief for first-time buyers. Considering phasing out mortgage interest tax relief for existing homeowners to pay for better-targeted subsidies. Otherwise, Halifax says, the number of repossessions are likely to increase, those with negative equity will remain in that position for several years, and any eventual recovery will be sluggish. In its bulletin Viewpoint, Halifax compares the housing recession that began in 1988 with previous downturns in 1974-76 and 1979-82. It finds: Real house prices fell in all three cycles but in the present one nominal, or cash, prices have fallen for the first time. Regional house price gaps widened to historically high levels in 1988 followed by a sharp narrowing of regional price differences. The most significant difference between the present cycle and past downturns is the drop in people's wealth, according to Halifax. It says that the fall in nominal house prices, combined with positive interest rates and a fall in inflation, 'forced up the real costs of borrowing for house purchases to levels not experienced before by home buyers in the UK'. It says past recoveries occurred because houses became more affordable as interest rates fell and people began to expect housing price increases.</p>

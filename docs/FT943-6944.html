			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Santer heralds change of style Mr Jacques Santer, incoming European Commission president, plans a more open, less autocratic style of leadership and a wide-ranging internal shake-up when he succeeds Mr Jacques Delors next January. Officials close to him say he wants a more collegiate approach, ending Mr Delors' practice of concentrating power in an inner circle and creating an underground network in the bureaucracy. The long-time Luxembourg premier's task is being made harder by member states' delays in putting forward candidates for commissioners and rivalry over portfolios. In France, arguments persist about suitable candidates. Former prime minister Edith Cresson would be welcomed as a political heavyweight, though French claims to the external trade portfolio are being resisted by the UK which wants Sir Leon Brittan to retain it. Brussels officials are also worried that referendums on EU membership in Finland, Sweden, and Norway could force delays in agreeing a division of the Commission spoils. If enlargement goes ahead, the number of commissioners will rise from 17 to 21 (including Austria). Mr Santer is said to be confident enough work can be found, but others are doubtful.</p>

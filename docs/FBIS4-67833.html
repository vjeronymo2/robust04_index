			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the ``Business News Weekly'' feature No. 15, Apr 4-10, </F> 94]    [Text] The European Union's [EU] TACIS [expansion unknown]  ``Nuclear Safety'' section provides for 54 million ECU earmarked  for Ukraine's nuclear power industry over the 1991-1993 period.    However, until quite recently, the promised aid failed to  assume a material quality, having been reduced to advisory  services.    In the meantime, TACIS envisages not only intellectual, but  technical aid by way of equipment and spare parts to be supplied  to Ukrainian nukes.    As Vladimir Kolesnikov, chief specialist with the State  Committee for nuclear power utilization, disclosed in an  interview to UKRINFORM, by August this year three Ukrainian NPPs  [nuclear power plants] (the South Ukrainian, Rivne and  Zaporozhye nukes) will have been supplied German Fishner-made  equipment worth $4.5 million. The equipment will improve the  nuke's nuclear safety systems.    Besides, experts of Spain's Unessa and Belgium's Tractebelle  are working at the South Ukrainian NPP. France's Electricite de  France sent its experts on a similar mission to the Rivne  nuclear power plant. Both teams' aim is to enhance the plants'  safety standards.    Britain's AEA Technology is to start work aimed at eventual  deactivation of the Chernobyl NPP's first, second and third  power generating units.    The Ukrainian Ministry for Chernobyl is shortly to hold  international tenders for a feasibility study, which involves  the Shelter project for the Chernobyl NPP's ill-fated fourth  reactor. The project's financing will be TACIS-covered to the  tune of 3.5 million ECU.</p>

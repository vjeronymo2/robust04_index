			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / N Korean leader names son to head military MR Kim Jong-il, the son and designated successor of North Korean President Kim Il-sung, yesterday obtained virtual control over the country's armed forces when he was appointed chairman of the national defence committee. This is considered a key step in Mr Kim's assumption of power from his father, who will be 81 on April 15. The transfer of power will be completed once the 51-year-old Mr Kim has become president of North Korea and general-secretary of the Korean Workers' Party, the two main posts now held by his father, who has ruled the country since 1945. The naming of Mr Kim to the highest military post comes amid speculation that he faces opposition from hard-liners within the 1.1m-strong armed forces. South Korean officials believe Mr Kim decided to withdraw North Korea from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty last month and declare a temporary state of 'semi-war' in a bid to assert his authority over the military and win its support. 'He needed to prove that he was an able and tough leader,' Mr Han Sung-joo, South Korean foreign minister, said recently. Analysts in Seoul believe that the northern military may be opposed to Mr Kim's succession because it fears its influence will be reduced once he achieves full power. Mr Kim lacks a military background, unlike his father, who was a guerrilla leader against the Japanese in Manchuria in the 1930s and 1940s. The elder Mr Kim and his military colleagues formed the nucleus of power in North Korea after 1945. Many of the younger Mr Kim's aides, however, are technocrats believed to favour limited reforms, such as opening the country to foreign investment. The North Korean parliament this week approved new and more liberal foreign investment laws modelled on Chinese practices. Mr Kim has concentrated on building ties with the military during the last few years. He was appointed first vice-chairman of the national defence committee in 1990, supreme commander of the armed forces in 1991 and a marshal last April. Some South Korean analysts claim that his assumption of full control over the military may make him feel more secure and persuade him to reverse North Korea's withdrawal from the non-proliferation treaty. They note that the two Koreas suddenly signed a non-nuclear pact a week after Mr Kim had become supreme commander in December 1991.</p>

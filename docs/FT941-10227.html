			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Trifast for market with Pounds 32m tag Trifast, the Sussex-based manufacturer and distributor of industrial fastenings, will be capitalised at Pounds 31.7m when it comes to the market later this month. James Capel, brokers for the flotation, said yesterday that the placing of 7.87m ordinary shares would be priced at 200p per share. Dealings begin on February 16. The placing, which has been received enthusiastically by institutions, will reduce the stake of the two founders, Mr Mike Timms and Mr Mike Roberts, from a total of 90 per cent to 40 per cent of the enlarged capital, split equally between them. Existing shareholders will have 8 to 8.5 per cent of the company, leaving new shareholders with 51.5 to 52 per cent. Trifast has said it expected pre-tax profits on ordinary activities would not be less than Pounds 2.55m in the year ending March 31, compared to Pounds 1.98m in 1992-93. On the basis of forecast earnings per share of 12.1p for the current year, the placing price represents a p/e ratio of 16.5. The placing will raise Pounds 15.7m, of which Pounds 12.2m will go to Mr Timms and Mr Roberts. The rest will be used by the company to reduce debt and purchase new freehold premises next to its head office in Uckfield. Mr Malcolm Diamond, Trifast's managing director, cited a number of reasons for the company's optimism on future prospects: Investment in new business teams in the UK and Singapore are expected to provide an increasing return from 1994. Overseas and export activities are increasing following the establishment of a coherent strategy combined with making resources available. Considerable scope exists for increased market penetration for both fastener management agreements and for niche products. The fragmented UK fastener market gives opportunities to develop greater market influence through organic growth and acquisitions.</p>

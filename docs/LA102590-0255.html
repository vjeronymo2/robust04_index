			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IT ALL ADDS UP: OAKLAND'S STEWART IS THE BEST IN BASEBALL;  </P> <P> PLAYERS: A'S PITCHER EARNS TOP SPOT IN ANNUAL COMPUTER RANKING BY STATISTICS.  DODGER'S SCIOSCIA IS TOP-RATED NL CATCHER.  </P> <P> The Oakland A's may not be the best team in baseball, but they do have the best  pitcher, according to computer rankings compiled by the sport's statisticians.  </P> <P> Dave Stewart edged Roger Clemens of the Boston Red Sox, 95.984 points to 95.783  on a scale of 100, the Elias Sports Bureau said.  </P> <P> Stewart has won 20 games or more the last four seasons and was the MVP of the  American League playoffs this season.  </P> <P> "There's nobody I'd rather have than Dave Stewart," A's Manager Tony La Russa  said. "He hasn't missed a start in four years."  </P> <P> San Francisco outfielder Kevin Mitchell was the top-rated non-pitcher, third in  the overall rankings at 94.759. Mitchell repeated in the National League  outfield, but Lonnie Smith of Atlanta and Barry Bonds of Pittsburgh replaced  Tony Gwynn of San Diego and Eric Davis of Cincinnati.  </P> <P> The rankings, created as part of the 1981 and 1985 strike settlements, are used  to determine free agent compensation. They are based on such statistics as  batting average, plate appearances, home runs and RBIs for hitters, and starts,  innings, ERA, saves and strikeouts for pitchers. Statistics from the 1989 and  1990 seasons are used and averaged.  </P> <P> The top 30% in each category are Type A free agents and their former teams get  two draft choices as compensation if they sign with a new team. The next 20%  are Type B players and their former clubs get one draft pick, while the group  making up the 10% below that are Type C players. Their former clubs get a  special draft pick if they don't re-sign.  </P> <P> Stewart, who isn't a free agent, having signed a $7-million, two-year contract  extension during the season, took over the top spot from Kansas City  right-hander Mark Gubicza. Clemens was the highest-rated player in 1988.  </P> <P> Ryne Sandberg of the Chicago Cubs led National League second basemen for the  seventh straight season in ranking by position, while Barry Larkin of  Cincinnati ended Ozzie Smith's six-year run at shortstop.  </P> <P> Mike Scioscia of the Dodgers replaced Tony Pena, then with St. Louis, at  catcher.  </P> <P> Will Clark of San Francisco led NL first basemen for the third straight year.  Tim Wallach of Montreal led the league's third basemen, replacing Bobby Bonilla  of Pittsburgh, who in 1989 ended Mike Schmidt's eight-year reign.  </P> <P> Doug Drabek of Pittsburgh replaced Orel Hershiser of the Dodgers as the  league's top starting pitcher. Drabek was 22-6 with a 2.76 ERA.  </P> <P> Rob Dibble of Cincinnati was the top reliever, replacing Mark Davis, who signed  with Kansas City.  </P> <P> In the American League, Stewart's teammate, Dennis Eckersley, led relievers for  the third straight year. Eckersley had 48 saves and a 0.61 ERA.  </P> <P> Catcher Carlton Fisk of the White Sox also led his position for the third  consecutive season. Fisk hit .285 with 18 homers.  </P> <P> Mike Greenwell of the Boston Red Sox repeated as the top-rated AL outfielder,  but Robin Yount of Milwaukee and Ruben Sierra of Texas replaced Kirby Puckett  of Minnesota and Jose Canseco of the A's.  </P> <P> Fred McGriff of Toronto became the fourth player in four years to lead AL first  basemen while Steve Sax of the New York Yankees replaced Julio Franco of Texas  at second base. Alan Trammell of Detroit won at shortstop, while Wade Boggs of  Boston was the top third baseman for the third time in four years.  </P> <P> Dwight Evans of Boston and Dave Parker of Milwaukee tied for the lead among  designated hitters. Evans was told Wednesday that the Red Sox will not exercise  his option for the 1991 season.  </P></p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Carpetright favours the smaller investor CARPETRIGHT has favoured smaller investors in deciding the basis of allocation for its flotation, which was 2.6 times subscribed. Trading in the shares starts today. The issue was priced at 148p a share valuing the carpet retailing group headed by Sir Phil Harris at Pounds 113.6m. The offer for sale of 13.7m shares attracted 14,229 applications for a total of 35.81m shares. Another 25.45m shares were placed with institutions. Applications for 250 to 3,000 shares will be met in full; those applying for 4,000 to 5,000 will receive 3,000; between 6,000 and 7,000: 3,500; between 8,000 and 80,000: 4,000. Applicants for between 90,000 and 990,000 shares will get 5 per cent of the amount they asked for and those for over 1m shares will receive 2.5 per cent. The level of subscription was described as 'not overwhelming' but since many of the shares on offer were being sold by existing investors this suggested that the pricing reflected a balance between sellers and buyers. MFI Furniture Group sold its 20 per cent stake raising Pounds 21.5m.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 13. Accessible Residential Housing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 13.1&blank;General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ADAAG 13.1 outlines the types of residential facilities addressed by this section. These facilities include newly constructed or altered single-family and multifamily dwelling units which are subject to title II of the ADA. The term ``dwelling unit'' is defined in this section and has been incorporated here to apply only to residential housing and not transient lodging. The term ``dwelling unit'' as used in ADAAG 13 specifically applies only to those facilities used as a residence which contain rooms and spaces for living, bathing, and sleeping and may provide a kitchen or food preparation area. An appendix note at A13.1 clarifies that this section does not obviate responsibility for compliance with Federal laws such as the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (42 U.S.C 3604 et seq.) and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C 794). The appendix also discusses certain characteristics that distinguish residential dwelling units addressed by this section from those considered transient lodging. Specifically, residential dwelling units typically contain accommodations, including kitchens, bathrooms, living and sleeping areas. A discussion of the definition of transient lodging is found in ADAAG 3.5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ADAAG 13 contains specific requirements for accessible residential housing which are in addition to those contained in ADAAG 4.1 through 4.35. This section defines ``public use areas'' and ``common use areas.'' The definition of ``public use area'' is consistent with ADAAG 3.5. The definition of ``common use area'' is consistent with the definition in ADAAG 3.5, but is more specific to residential facilities covered by this section and applies to rooms, spaces or elements used by residents or their guests, such as hallways, lounges, lobbies, laundry rooms, refuse rooms, mail rooms, storage facilities, areas used for official functions, recreational areas and passageways among and between buildings. The term ``common use'' excludes spaces wholly within a dwelling unit. An appendix note has been added to clarify this requirement. An exception provides that elevators are not required in residential facilities that are less than four stories if the requirements of 13.1(2), 13.2 and 13.3 are met. A second exception has been included for common use areas that serve a recreational purpose. Under this exception, where multiple recreational facilities, such as tennis courts, are provided, at least one of each type must be accessible. An appendix note encourages that a sufficient number of accessible multiple common use recreation facilities should be provided to ensure equitable opportunities for persons with disabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A commenter asked whether a facility which provides a single room occupancy, is a dwelling unit. The commenter noted that meals are provided on a congregate basis at these facilities, if at all. Other commenters, including some colleges and universities, requested a clarification as to whether the accommodations they provide are dwelling units or transient lodging.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Where a tenant rents only a sleeping room on a transient basis it is not a dwelling unit as defined in ADAAG 13. Some sleeping rooms have modest food storage facilities. However, these rooms are not generally intended to be dwelling units. Such accommodations are more similar to hotels and motels and if so, would be considered transient lodging subject to ADAAG 9 (Accessible Transient Lodging). Language has been added to ADAAG 13.1 which states that this section does not apply to transient lodging. An appendix note makes it clear that other residential housing for live-in employees or apartments for students would be covered by ADAAG 13.1 if they contain dwelling units as defined by this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A large number of commenters including, the Camden County Office for the Disabled, the State of Washington Building Code Council, the National Conference of States on Building Codes and Standards, the Montgomery County, (Maryland) Housing Opportunities Commission and, the State of New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, expressed concern regarding the application of these guidelines to single-family dwelling units constructed or altered ``by or on behalf of'' a State or local government entity. New Jersey noted that ``this requirement would have an adverse impact on governmental single-family housing programs that include low rate mortgages, zero down payment, closing cost assistance, and construction financing to developers of for-sale single-family homes.'' Other commenters supported coverage of single-family residences such as official residences, those provided for governors and State university presidents, and single-family housing provided as public housing. The City of Chicago Mayor's Office commented ``The fact that the ATBCB guidelines now require State and local governments to apply access standards to single-family dwellings is highly commendable.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 202 of the ADA prohibits public entities from discriminating on the basis of disability. ``Public entity'' includes any State or local government, any department, agency, special purpose district, or instrumentality of a State or local government. See 42 U.S.C. 12131 and 12132. Thus, facilities which are subject to title II of the ADA are covered by these guidelines. Single-family dwellings such as a president's house at a university are included in this definition and such dwellings are addressed in these guidelines. This provision has been revised to indicate that these guidelines apply to residential housing subject to title II of the ADA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

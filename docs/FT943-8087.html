			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Ford spends Pounds 1bn bringing Jaguar to profit Ford's investment in Jaguar, the UK luxury carmaker, will total around Pounds 1bn in the seven years to the end of 1996, Mr Nick Scheele, the Jaguar chairman, said yesterday. Jaguar, acquired by Ford for Pounds 1.56bn in 1989, is expected to return to profit next year after six years of successive losses, Mr Scheele said. Pre-tax losses from 1989 to 1993 totalled Pounds 776m. Ford is investing heavily to renew and expand Jaguar's product range. The first result of the programme will be unveiled next month, when it launches the new XJ series of luxury saloons, developed at a cost of around Pounds 200m to replace the XJ6 range. The XJ range is expected to lift total Jaguar production to at least 38,000 next year - from 32,000 this year, 29,548 last year and a low of 20,593 in 1992. Volume production began two weeks ago and the cars will be launched in the UK and the US next month, in continental Europe in October and in Japan and Australia in November. It will be sold in 64 markets around the world. Jaguar has invested Pounds 8.5m in a new assembly line at its Browns Lane plant in Coventry which has the capacity to produce 50,000 to 55,000 cars annually on a single-shift system. Initially the plant will be capable of producing up to 42,500 of the new XJ series on this basis. A big part of the Jaguar investment programme is aimed at the development of a new grand tourer sports coupe and convertible to replace the XJS range in autumn 1996. The company is also developing a range of V8 engines for launch in the new sports car. The engines will be built at a facility under construction at the Ford engine plant at Bridgend, south Wales. Jaguar is expected to launch a smaller sports saloon to compete in 1998 with cars such as the BMW 5 series. This car could double Jaguar output to more than 100,000 a year by 1998/99. Mr Scheele said final approval for the project was not expected from Ford for at least 18 months. It is still unclear whether this car will be built in the US or the UK. Jaguar's investment programme has yielded big gains in quality and efficiency at its UK plants. Mr Jim Padilla, Jaguar executive director of manufacturing and engineering, said labour hours per unit had been cut by 54 per cent between 1991 and 1994. The hourly paid workforce has been cut by 54 per cent and the salaried workforce by 37 per cent. Inventories had been reduced by 35 per cent over the period. In terms of quality the number of problems per 100 cars at the end of the assembly line has fallen from 1,432 at the end of 1990 to 281 by February this year. A 15 per cent improvement has been achieved on Jaguar's 1994-model cars.</p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . . : GORDANA RASHOVICH REKINDLES OBIE-WINNING 'SHAYNA MAIDEL' ROLE  </P> <P> "I thought I would find it all very distracting and too pretty to concentrate  on the Holocaust here in West Hollywood," says actress Gordana Rashovich. "But  I went to the Simon Wiesenthal Center and I watched a show about Hitler on TV,  so there was no problem refocusing."  </P> <P> Rashovich is repeating her haunting, Obie Award-winning performance in Barbara  Lebow's acclaimed drama "A Shayna Maidel," currently playing at the Tiffany  Theater in West Hollywood. Set in New York City in 1946, "Shayna Maidel" tells  the story of two Jewish sisters, one brought up in the United States and the  other a survivor of a Nazi concentration camp in Poland, and their father, who  reunite after a separation of 20 years. Rashovich plays Luisa, the fragile,  painfully thin and ghostly pale survivor, haunted by the memories of her dead  mother, baby daughter and best friend, and obsessed with finding her missing  husband.  </P> <P> The actress originated the role of Luisa five years ago at the Hartford Stage  in Connecticut and appeared in the hit Off-Broadway production for nearly a  year. Rashovich finds working with a new cast and director (Deborah LaVine)  stimulating. "It's like visiting an old friend in a foreign country, someone  you don't get to see on a daily basis. You go back and the same things are  rekindled, the same kind of friendships, the same kind of bonds."  </P> <P> Rashovich prepared for her role by reading books and watching films on the  Holocaust. "I am a little shy about asking direct questions to survivors," she  says. "If they are interested in telling me things, I will sit there. But  reading is private. You can do it at home and you can personalize it."  </P> <P> She also drew on her European trips as a youngster (her father is Yugoslav, her  mother American). "I always heard war stories there," she remembers. "These  people didn't forget World War II. It was in their back yard. I will never  forget those stories -- how people had to hide in the forest and eat wood to  survive. I think that left an indelible impression upon me." SUSAN KING  </P></p>

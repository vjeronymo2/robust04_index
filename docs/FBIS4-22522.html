			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Kharitonenkov: "Gold Fever in Russia: A </F> Boom in Illegal Production of Precious Metals and Stones Has  Begun in the Country"]    [Text] The occupation of currency trader is going through a  period of rapid growth in Russia. The reforms begun in the  country (or what are reputed to be reforms) have not deprived  this occupation of its criminal touch by any means. Rather, just  the opposite is true.    According to data of the Economic Crimes Main Administration  (GUEP) of the Russian Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs,  the stratification of society by income level and the  concentration of large sums in the hands of a relatively small  number of entrepreneurs have led to a sharp increase in the  demand for gold, silver, diamonds, and foreign currency. The  vacuum formed in this market was filled first by representatives  of the criminal world, which is perfectly natural. One of the  specialists in this problem--GUEP staffer Aleksandr  Alekseyev--believes we can now speak about the existence in  Russia of a real industry in the illegal extraction, processing,  and sale of gold and diamonds. Criminals are actively organizing  ties with officials in the state apparatus and foreign  colleagues and developing channels for the "export" of Russian  valuables.    A situation, especially a criminal situation, can be  evaluated only conditionally by statistics, but the figures on  currency crime for 1993 look really impressive. According to the  GUEP data, nearly 6,000 crimes of this type were discovered last  year; during the course of their investigation, more than 250  kilograms of gold, nearly 50 kilograms of platinum, over 1.8  metric tons of silver, precious stones totaling 1,877 carats,  and so forth were confiscated--altogether more than 13 billion  rubles [R] (in last year's prices)! It should be noted at the  same time that, according to the same statistics, the illegal  currency business, like the drug business, is one of the most  profitable forms of crime, and according to the most optimistic  estimates, a very small proportion of the "commodity" in illegal  turnover is being confiscated by the authorities.    According to the GUEP data citd by Aleksandr Alekseyev, the  backbone of Russia's illegal currency business is made up of  well-organized groups from republics in the Caucasus united by  family clans. Each one of them closely monitors the gold mining  regions of the country, and they are mainly the ones, in the  specialists' opinion, who are practically paralyzing normal  development of the entire currency market. While previously the  currency traders were considered the intellectual elite of the  criminal world and stood apart in it, openly criminal methods  have taken root in their activities, such as armed raids on  placer mines, attempts to work deposits, and so forth. The GUEP  experts believe that a sizable "contribution" to this has been  made by the sluggishness of the Russian Federation Committee on  Precious Metals and Precious Stones [Roskomdragmet], in which  the system for protecting valuables has been practically  unchanged over the past 10 years. The technologies and equipment  being used in the mining and processing of gold and natural  diamonds is extremely obsolete, and, as a result, the precious  raw material often turns out to be easily accessible. With the  introduction of new, more improved capacities, the rates of gold  consumption are not being reviewed in a timely manner, to put it  mildly--one more source for the thieves. There are frequent  cases in which persons who have not been checked out are allowed  in the Roskomdragmet itself, where work associated with the  extraction and processing of gold is conducted. In February  1994, during a check by the gold acceptance office for the  "Chikaya" Placer Mine of the "Zabaykalzoloto" Association,  nearly 30 kilograms of gold to be turned over to the state were  discovered to have been concealed by employees.    In Alekseyev's words, the expected economic gain was not  achieved and the right to extract precious metals and precious  stones granted to all juridical persons and citizens of Russia  by the government decision in January 1992 was not materialized.  But then, it had already become a widespread excuse for the  "laundering" of illegally obtained valuables by criminal groups  and one more source of enrichment. In 1993, as an example, 578  licenses were issued to physical persons in the country's 15  gold mining regions, and they turned in 167 kilograms of the  metal--a ridiculous figure, in the specialists' opinion. In  Magadan Oblast, the official productivity of one prospector  averaged just a little over 250 grams of gold.    According to the GUEP data, the principal channel for taking  out the stolen gold and diamonds continues to be air  transportation. But the methods of shipping it has changed  somewhat in recent years, taking the situation into account.  While previously the couriers preferred to conceal the precious  stones on themselves or in their clothing, as a rule, now they  take them out mainly in their baggage (because of the higher  volume of flights) or they avoid inspection altogether with the  help of corrupt airport employees.    It is worth noting that politics has been mixed up in the  illegal currency business lately. The experts believe that part  of the precious stones being stolen in Russia through corrupt  contacts in the Caucasus, the Baltic, and Central Asia are being  used to support and finance extremist nationalist movements.    Analysis of all these processes, according to Aleksandr  Alekseyev, has led GUEP experts to the conclusion that the gold  mining industry may become one of the principal levers in the  near future in the struggle against criminal associations for  their sphere of influence. At the same time, this sector of  industry itself will be subjected to even greater widespread  pressure from their side. According to GUEP estimates, crime in  the currency field may increase by several times as much. But  there are a few grounds for optimism with respect to control  over the situation by this service, Alekseyev believes. On one  hand, the sector's breakup into separate and independent  enterprises (including the mines and pits) is continuing. As a  consequence, the centralized system for protecting the valuables  being extracted has collapsed. On the other hand, the  legislation which regulates currency operations, the transfer of  precious stones, and so forth continues to be extremely watered  down and abstract. Article 88 of the Russian Federation UK  [Criminal Code] does not contain a clear-cut description of what  constitutes "an illegal currency operation." According to the  law "On Currency Regulation and Currency Control," establishment  of the procedure for a transaction with precious metals and the  like was put in the hands of the government, the Central Bank,  the Ministry of Finance, and customs, but these questions have  not been resolved to date. The numerous norms which exist are in  open contradiction with each other. As an example, the illegal  purchase, sale, and extraction of gold is considered a crime  now, but its storage and transportation is not considered a  crime. It is foolish, but this is how the law is. Of course, the  criminals are aware of this and take advantage of it. It is  interesting that the confusion reigning in this field, according  to Aleksandr Alekseyev, has attracted the interest of Western  businessmen. According to the GUEP, many industrial trading  firms, mainly in the United States, South Africa, and Israel,  consider the present currency situation in Russia to be very  favorable for their activity. Negotiations on collaboration and  the formation of various SP [joint ventures] to extract and  process gold, diamonds, and so forth, are now being conducted by  dozens of firms, and in most cases the Russian side does not  turn out to be in the most advantageous position. But Russian  commercial structures' interest in precious metals and stones is  high as well. But it has a somewhat different tinge--according  to certain data, businessmen are preparing and pushing through a  legal basis to circumvent the state monopoly on trade in  precious metals and stones.</p>

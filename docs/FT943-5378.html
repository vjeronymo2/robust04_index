			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Kohl land row with Gorbachev Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet president, were yesterday locked in a public dispute, the outcome of which could affect thousands of former property owners in east Germany. Mr Kohl, who will meet Mr Gorbachev in Bonn on Wednesday, said on German Radio that Moscow had linked its agreement on the German unification negotiations to Bonn's acceptance of the legality of the Soviet administration over eastern Germany between 1945 and 1949. During that time the Soviet administration expropriated 8.2m acres of land and hundreds of enterprises. The land was subsequently divided and distributed to ethnic Germans fleeing eastern Europe. But last week, Mr Gorbachev, supported yesterday by Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, former Soviet foreign minister, challenged Mr Kohl, claiming Moscow had never linked the expropriation issue with Soviet acceptance of unification talks. Their reluctance to support Mr Kohl, facing re-election in October for his fourth term, coincides with claims by former land owners who argue that it was west and east German politicians, and not Mr Gorbachev, who agreed among themselves not to give back land to, or compensate, the Prussian aristocracy.</p>

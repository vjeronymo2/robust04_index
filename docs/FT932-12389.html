			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei surges 2.9% in run-up to Golden Week BROAD buying by public fund managers and foreign investors triggered a rally that boosted equity prices by 2.9 per cent on the first day of the new trading account, writes Wayne Aponte. The Nikkei average ended 583.08 ahead at 20,206.71, after trading between an intraday low of 19,642.41 and a high of 20,267.84. The last time the stock market settled above 20,000 was on April 19. The Topix index of all first section stocks was up 36.91 at 1,572,68, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.03 to 1,241.83. Volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was estimated at 600m shares, compared with Monday's final 299m. Advances overwhelmed declines by 1,004 to 87, with 84 issues unchanged. Market sentiment turned bullish from the outset when public fund managers and foreign securities companies placed heavy buy orders. The advance squeezed market participants who had been expecting the Nikkei to trade lower and encouraged dealers, individual investors and investment trust managers to join the rally. Analysts said there were no fundamental factors fuelling the day's impressive gains, but a steady yen against the dollar provided the stock market with stability. One analyst at a Japanese brokerage said many investors now expected the Nikkei to hold current levels before the Golden Week holiday, which begins tomorrow. He added that government buying through public funds would discourage investors from selling the market short. Non-ferrous metal issues rose in tandem with gold futures prices. Dowa Mining added Y12 at Y655 and Mitsui Mining and Smelting gained Y8 at Y518. But Sumitomo Metal and Mining, the most active issue of the day, ended unchanged at Y990. Investors bought blue chips in the telecommunications sector on reports of a special provision in the government's budget for fiscal 1994 to improve new kinds of infrastructure. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y50,000 to Y973,000, Nippon Comsys Y90 to Y1,290 and NEC Y49 to Y980. The day's buying spree also lifted the brokerages: Nomura appreciated Y100 to Y2,110, Daiwa Y50 to Y1,280 and Nikko Y47 to Y1,040. In Osaka, the OSE average finished 493.65 higher at 21,923.14 in volume of 22.7m shares. Roundup IN the Pacific Rim, investors found a range of reasons to sell and markets finished lower on the day. BANGKOK tumbled as worries heightened over an expanded investigation of the wid-ening stock manipulation scandal. The SET index fell 13.70, or 1.6 per cent, to 869.98 in turnover of Bt3.4bn. Investors grew increasingly cautious as the Securities and Exchange Commission, which filed charges last week, was poised to increase its list of suspected stock manipulators. HONG KONG eased as cautious investors realised profits ahead of the second round of Sino-British talks starting today. The Hang Seng index closed 8.87 down at 6,836.88 in turnover of HKDollars 5.1bn, against Monday's HKDollars 6.8bn. Bank shares, which have led the recent rise, lost ground on profit-taking. HSBC Holdings receded HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 72.50. SINGAPORE retreated on profit-taking after hitting a record intraday high in early trading. The Straits Times Industrial index was finally 10.63 off at 1,786.63. AUSTRALIA declined as the rally in gold issues lost steam, prompting profit-taking in recent gainers. The All Ordinaries index slipped 5.4 to 1,704.7 in turnover of ADollars 318.6m. Higher gold bullion prices supported Newcrest Mining, which added 35 cents at ADollars 3.27, but Commonwealth Bank, after recent strong gains, relinquished 28 cents to ADollars 8.12. SEOUL moved lower for the fourth consecutive trading day in thin volume as further profit-taking was seen. The composite index shed 7.96 to 722.96 in thin turnover of Won527.72bn. KUALA LUMPUR was also subjected to profit-taking as some investors grew cautious over a further rise in the market. The composite index eased 0.87 to 692.57, while volume contracted to 462.6m shares from 510.2m. MANILA closed moderately softer amid concern over prolonged power blackouts, but traders said overall sentiment remained firm. The composite index lost 3.02 to 1,549.39 in turnover of 369.5m pesos, against 333.9m pesos. TAIWAN weakened in quiet trading. The weighted index ended 41.67 down at 4,506.11 in turnover of TDollars 27.1bn. Brokers commented that talks taking place between Taiwan and China in Singapore had had little effect on the market.</p>

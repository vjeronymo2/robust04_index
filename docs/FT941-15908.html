			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Jobless rate declines to under 10%: Sterling rises as Treasury rules out cut in interest rates The UK's steadily improving economic outlook received a further boost yesterday with news that unemployment in December fell below 10 per cent of the workforce for the first time since July 1992. But the greater than expected fall in unemployment was coupled with comments from Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, that there would be 'no change for the time being in interest rates'. This triggered a sharp rise in sterling and a steep fall in equity prices. The pound rose over 1 1/4 pfennigs against the D-Mark, bursting through the DM2.60 barrier, to close in London at DM2.6072, and added a cent against the dollar, finishing at Dollars 1.5013. In New York sterling finished at DM2.6032 and Dollars 1.5035. Fading hopes of an early base rate cut from the present level of 5.5 per cent along with falls in worldwide equity markets, depressed the London stock market with the FT-SE 100 index closing 41.8 down at 3372.0. Seasonally adjusted unemployment fell 46,800 to 2,766,000 in December, or 9.8 per cent of the workforce. November's decline was also revised upwards by 3,000 to 39,000. Unemployment has now declined for four consecutive months, and dropped 226,000 since it peaked in January 1993. On an unadjusted basis, December's unemployment total rose 13,000 to 2,783,000. Figures for unfilled vacancies at job centres rose 4,500 to 145,400 in December. Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, said the downward trend was now firmly established, although he felt the overall total was still 'unacceptably high'. The only weak point in the jobs figures was the manufacturing sector, where employment fell by 7,000 in December and the amount of overtime worked dropped to 8.11m hours per week, the lowest figure since record started to be kept in 1976. The good news on the jobless front overshadowed big redundancies announced by National Westminster Bank, which said it was cutting another 4,200 jobs in 1994, and British Petroleum which is closing its chemicals plant at Baglan Bay in South Wales with the loss of 600 jobs. The employment figures were the latest encouraging statistics to be discussed at the monthly monetary meeting held yesterday between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. The Treasury's monthly monetary report, published yesterday for the meeting, pointed to subdued inflationary pressures - a view confirmed by statistics showing a 3 per cent annual increase in average earnings in November, unchanged from the October rise and a 25 year low. According to Mr Hunt, the UK has the 'prospect of a long period of sustainable non-inflationary growth'. However, Ms Ann Clwyd, Labour's employment spokesperson, said: 'With the real level of unemployment above four million, the government is using discredited statistics to con the public that it has the economy under control.'

There is a distinctly unreal air about it. It is  more than the sight of the world's economic superpowers battling  it out in Geneva, oblivious to the Luddite squeakings of Mr  George Fernandes and his ilk. It is the manner in which domestic  critics of the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade seem blind to two glaring fallacies in their arguments.    The first is the curious illusion India can afford to turn  its nose up at GATT and thus world trade.    The second is the insistent wail that the Dunkel draft is  grossly slanted against India. Accepting GATT is to sell the  country's soul, seeds and sovereignty for a few boatloads of  fabric. This is a farcical misconception that looks only to  India's concessions and none of its gains.    GATT negotiations are about politics. As in all forms of  international diplomacy there is a certain amount of give and  take. If India is to judge whether GATT was a success it must  ask how much it could have influenced events and then consider  how much it accomplished. By this measure it can be said India,  far from being sold a mickey, came out of it all reasonably well.    The thing to understand is just how much India needs GATT.  India needs to trade. The days of Nehruvian isolationism are  over. It cannot withdraw into a protectionist shell, consoling  itself with the thought Bangladesh is worse off. In very crude  terms India needs to trade because it needs foreign exchange. It  needs dollars and pounds to pay off its mammoth foreign debts  and because it imports most of the petroleum that fuels its  economy.    Trade is also the best means to make an economy grow. As any  number of boffins will tell you, nations like India that have  been introverted about trade average three per cent growth.  Economies that have looked outward double, sometimes triple,  that rate.    No better example exists than China. In its Maoist cocoon it  seemed destined to be the biggest poorhouse in the world. As a  Dengist butterfly it is slated to overtake the United States in  25 years. China is not a GATT member but that is not for want of  trying. Beijing has incorporated most of Dunkel in its laws.  Only a spat with the US keeps its membership pending.    India has no alternative to trade. But trade can be like  Darwinian evolution, red in tooth and claw. An export-import  free for all is a boxing arena where bantamweights battle it  out with heavyweights. Obviously the former--in global trade  this means the third world--will be soundly bloodied.    This is why GATT is important. For all its faults it is the  closest thing to a set of Queensbury rules that world trade has.  During the negotiations a developing nation that used wiliness  to compensate for its lack of economic clout could save its skin  and its markets. Outside GATT or in a world without Dunkel,  India would have to fight multifront trade wars. Think of "Super  301," double its fangs and put it in the law book of every  country in the world. Then talk of a neo-colonialist nightmare.    The question is whether India was wily enough in GATT. Keep  in mind India is a trade pygmy, smaller than Singapore. It has  no weight to throw around. The only other way to win friends and  influence people in Geneva is to be part of a like minded bloc  of nations. Hence the plethora of GATT clubs from the upstart  Cairns Group to the bewhiskered European Union. Try to think of  an economic grouping that includes India on its roster. New  Delhi boasts of two. One is the Group of Fifteen dinosaur. The  other is the South Asia Preferential Trade Agreement where  India's influence is augmented by Bhutan's.    To put it in a cargohold, India went to Geneva in a  wheelchair and dealt with titans. They should have walked all  over India. But they did not. Consider how the country fared in  some areas it had a special interest.    The most controversial one, the source of many decibels from  the Lok Sabha's leftist fringe, is patents. There is a  completely specious claim GATT will mean every seen planted in  India will mean paying the multinational. Only the selling of  seeds on a commercial basis is restricted and even there India  can fudge the laws. Incidentally the Indian Council of  Agricultural Research expects to make a killing thanks to Dunkel  by peddling its own hybrids around the world.    India had virtually met Dunkel's requirements long before.  Of  GATT's seven intellectual property right areas, Indian law was  in consonance with six. The one area of difference was  patents--on seeds and drugs. In drugs India has secured the  enormous loophole of being allowed to produce any medicine in  the "public interest." And hang who holds the patent.    India can say it was shortchanged over textiles. Textile  exports are outside GATT, governed by a quota based Multifibre  Agreement. Asian textile exporters have been clamouring for MFA  to be scrapped and absorbed into GATT. The US and the EU  [European Union], fearful their millions of textile workers will  end up on the dole, have refused to accelerate MFA's 10 year  phase out period.    But again to renounce GATT is foolish. Under Dunkel the  MFA's  death is guaranteed. If India refuses to sign GATT its textiles  will face pre-GATT tariffs of 50 per cent or more. Other textile  exporters will bask in the three per cent tariff average GATT  promises by AD 2000.    India, and Asia in general, can also complain about the  failure to tighten GATT's anti-dumping rules. The West has made  an art of abusing such rules to tie up Asian exporters in  lengthy litigation before GATT. Asia can gripe about the hefty  two year safety margin the US and EU have awarded themselves  against foreign financial institutions. Though given India's  decrepit financial sector New Delhi is probably quite happy it  can cite this precedent to give itself a buffer period.    India has gained elsewhere. A gem of an opportunity lies in  GATT's agricultural clauses. Much ado has been made of the  requirement all nations must cut subsidies to farmers and how  this will pauperise the Indian farmer.    Here is the real story. One, India has to cut subsidies  anyway if it hopes to reduce its deficit. Two, it is forgotten  the most generous farm subsidies in the world are dished out by  the West's governments. Partly because of these subsidies third  world farmers have never been able to sell their produce to the  West. Thanks to the Uruguay round the agricultural markets of  Europe and North America have been pried open for Indian  exports. Potentially this is a windfall of cyclonic proportions.  It is why far seeing Indian farm leaders like Mr Sharad Joshi  worship before the shrine of Dunkel.    There is and will be much about India hoodwinked, mugged and  left to multinational rape. The record says otherwise. It is  definite GATT will knock some companies off their perches, put  people out of their jobs. Every country will suffer. Japan and  South Korea are glumly expecting millions of their farmers to be  turfed out. But they look at the $250 billion it is  conservatively estimated GATT will add to the world economy in  its first year alone and figure it is worth it. Insulated India  will suffer less social dislocation than them.    Even the US and the EU did not have their way in everything.  The mighty US, card carrying member of two trade blocs and world  leader in all export sectors, bowed to demands for "compulsory  licensing" of drugs in the public interest. India banded  together with Brussels to pull this coup off.    It is not necessarily true GATT was full of North  browbeating  South. When India asked for revisions in the clauses in  September it was a group of 38 third world brethren who scuttled  the effort.    When Mr Pranab Mukherjee tells the Lok Sabha India has "no  alternative" he is for once speaking like a boy scout. Without  the Uruguay round the United Nations calculates the third world  loses 20 per cent of its markets in seven years. Without Dunkel  the rich nations would be unrestrainably greedy. They would  simply kick the South into accepting the most disadvantageous  terms possible. The GATT tribunals would not be able to serve as  courts of appeal.    This would be as nothing if the world signed GATT and India  refused. This would be putting a noose around the neck of the  nation. Indian tea and jewellery would face tariffs 10 times  those of the Sri Lankan tea or Thai jewellery. After a few years  the words "made in India" would fade from international memory.  Do not denounce GATT. Instead be thankful the Uruguay round has  at last been squared.    Let Mr Manmohan Singh play the card of liberalisation well  and in the next GATT round the world will await a trade  agreement among China, Japan and India in the same manner it  looked to Washington and Brussels this week.</p>

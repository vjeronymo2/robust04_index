			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 12 TASS -- "An economic policy of  compromise pursued by the Russian Government which was commented  upon by the leader of Russia's Choice movement, Yegor Gaydar at  the opening of the Russia's Choice founding congress today, will  be continued for some time until the situation in society  stabilises," said Presidential Chief of Staff Sergey Filatov,  who is a delegate to the congress.    "After the situation stabilizes, after regions give their  full support, it will be possible to take more resolute and  tough steps," he said. He pointed out that the course of  resolving problems by the president's decrees will be continued.    In reply to a question asked by ITAR-TASS, Filatov pointed  out that he is a delegate of the congress and was one of the  party's organisers at the first stage of its creation. But it's  too early to speak about membership in the party yet, since  practically, it has not yet been created, he said.    According to Filatov, the president did not express his  attitude to the newly created party on the eve of its founding  congress.</p>

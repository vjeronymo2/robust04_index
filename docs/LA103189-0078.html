			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STAR WITNESS IN MURDER CASE BALKS  </P> <P> The star prosecution witness in the case of two brothers charged with  masterminding the murders of their elderly parents refused to testify Monday.  </P> <P> Michael Dominguez, 30, of Las Vegas, who pleaded guilty in 1986 to two counts  of first-degree murder in the case, had agreed to testify against the other  defendants.  </P> <P> Although Dominguez testified at two preliminary hearings, when called Monday to  testify at the trial of one of the brothers, Stewart Woodman, he repeatedly  refused.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Cooper found Dominguez in contempt of court  for refusing to testify and fined him $2,000.  </P> <P> Dominguez said he refused to testify because prosecutors might want to use his  testimony to bolster unspecified charges they were preparing against him, an  allegation denied by Deputy Dist. Atty. Pat Dixon.  </P> <P> Cooper ordered Dominguez to remain in custody in Los Angeles County until the  trial is over or he agrees to testify.  </P> <P> Woodman, 39, and his brother, Neil Woodman, 45, are charged with hiring several  reputed hit men to gun down their elderly parents in the garage of their luxury  Brentwood condominium in 1985 after a bitter dispute involving the family's San  Fernando Valley plastics firm.  </P></p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Investment forum attracts little new trade More than 300 politicians, government officials and businessmen are likely to attend the International Investment Forum on Northern Ireland to be hosted by Mr John Major, the prime minister, in Belfast next week. However, Mr Major may find himself preaching to the converted. Many delegates will represent companies which have already invested in the province. The Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland, which is organising the conference, has declared itself, 'well pleased' with the response to invitations. It says that so far more than 260 delegates have agreed to attend. By last night fewer than 12 corporate executives from the US had agreed to attend - although Mr Ron Brown, the US Commerce Secretary, and four congressmen are to go. The executives include Mr John Stafford, chairman of American Home Products; Mr Ronald Evans, president of Best Western International, Mr Patrick Keough, president of Computronics Distributors, Mr James McCann, president of 800-Flowers; Mr William Flynn, chairman of Mutual of American Life Insurance Company, Ms Susan Morrice, manager of S. Morrice &amp; Associates, Mr James Malloy, chairman of Smurfit Packaging Corporation, and Mr George David, president of United Technologies. Mr Evans is joining the mission in hopes of getting more affiliate hotels. The company's enthusiasm for Northern Ireland springs from its experience in the Irish Republic, where it found 'a wealth of young multilingual talent' and the best telecommunications infrastructure in Europe, after France. Mr David is participating 'to support US government efforts to promote peace through economic development'. UT already employs 1,100 in the province making wire automotive harnesses. Only a handful of British companies not already involved in Northern Ireland are thought to have agreed to attend, although the number may grow. Overseas investment in Northern Ireland has totalled Pounds 1.6bn since 1986, involving 265 projects. About one-third of the investments are from the US, with a considerable number from the Far East, notably Korea and Japan. After the speeches on Wednesday morning delegates will be offered tours of factory sites, where they will be told of wages 16 per cent below the UK average, grants of up to 50 per cent of start-up building costs and a pool of skilled labour. One company certain to be visited is US-owned Seagate Technology, in Derry. It employs 270 people making hard disc drive components. Mr Michael Caulfield, the managing director said: 'Nowhere else offered us the combination of grants and incentives, which cut our start-up costs, plus a dedicated and competitively priced labour force.'</p>

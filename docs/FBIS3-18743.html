Aho Promised Vague Tax  Reductions Even This Year"]    [Text] On Friday [4 February] Prime Minister Esko Aho  (Center Party) and Labor Minister Ilkka Kanerva (Conservative)  manifested strong faith in the expansion of the economy. Aho  announced that "the recession may be regarded as having ended,"  and Kanerva stated that the growth in unemployment would stop in  March or April.    The ministers shared the reinforcement of faith at a news  conference that was organized for the presentation of a  17-billion-markka supplemental budget.    The policy lines contained in the supplemental budget were  already reported in two news conferences in December. The  supplementary budget will include mainly investments and  investment support measures. It is part of a package through  which the government is attempting to stimulate the national  economy partially through borrowed money.    Iiro Viinanen (Conservative), the minister of finance,  aroused attention by failing to arrive at the news conference on  Friday. Viinanen's staff explained the incident as a breakdown  in communications.  <H5>  Accelerated Supplementary Budget </H5>   At the news conference Aho also made a vague promise  regarding tax reductions. When questioned, he clarified that  when the May development forecasts arrive it will be possible to  say whether it is possible to reduce taxes further this year. At  the beginning of the week Viinanen sharply rejected the notion  of tax relief this year.    The supplementary budget that was presented on Friday was  drafted after intense negotiations among the ministries a week  earlier than planned, and it was able to be presented two days  before the presidential election.    Aho denied that the supplementary budget had anything to do  with the elections. He justified the speedup by the fact that  the Eduskunta that is assembling next week will thus be able to  make stimulus decisions more rapidly.  <H5>  Rise in Costs a Concern </H5>   By "ending the recession" Aho meant in strict economic terms  that output began to rise in the fall. In the near future the  Ministry of Finance will make a forecast in which this year's  growth will be indicated as at least 2 percent and next year's  growth as at least 5 percent. Aho was ready to give the  government credit for the beginning of economic growth.    Aho emphasized that unemployment and public sector debt  would  cast a shadow over the whole decade. He predicted, however, that  the beginning of economic growth, the improvement in export  competitiveness, and the lowering of the interest rate would  create the prerequisites for taking care of the problems.  Speeding up investments is important from this standpoint, Aho  noted.    It is also important to speed up investments in order to  avoid bottlenecks in output that would raise production costs  and thus cause inflation. Aho set the maintenance of cost  discipline as one of the main objectives.    Talk about the danger of overheating, however, Aho labeled  as  "confusion in the opposition."  <H5>  Tug-of-War Already Over Next Year's Budget </H5>   Kanerva justified his promise that unemployment would ease  by  the fact that the increase in short-term unemployment had ceased  at the turn of the year and that at this time already 43 percent  of the terminating unemployment cases end with a permanent job  in the open labor market.    The supplementary budget issued on Friday will create about  16,000 jobs, according to Kanerva.    The government will begin preparation of the budgets for  1995  and subsequent years next week. The intent is to agree on the  final amounts at the beginning of March.    Preliminary discussions on the budget have been interpreted  as a tense atmosphere. Several ministers are known to have  pressures for making a liberal election budget, while on the  other hand, Viinanen and his staff want to retain the previously  agreed-on policy of reducing government expenditures.</p>

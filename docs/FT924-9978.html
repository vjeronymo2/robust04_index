			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Property blow for Polly Peck administrators PROPERTY CLAIMED by Polly Peck International, the collapsed fruit and electronics group, has been taken over by the government of northern Cyprus dealing a further blow to administrators trying to recover assets on the island. Officials confirmed that the Kyrenia View Hotel and eight apartment blocks owned through a local subsidiary of PPI have been taken over in settlement of a TL12bn (Pounds 955,000) debt owed to the government-run social security pension fund by the companies of Mr Asil Nadir, the former PPI chairman. Mr Richard Stone, the administrator appointed in October 1990, has so far been frustrated in efforts to gain access to the PPI assets by three injunctions taken out by Mr Mentes Aziz, the personal lawyer of Mr Nadir. Mr Mentes confirmed he was in negotiations with the administrators. However, the latest move will be seen as a further obstacle in claiming the assets. The freehold properties are owned by Pearl Construction, one of several PPI companies owned through an intermediary company on the Isle of Man. PPI owns two other hotels in Cyprus, a fruit exporting company and a packaging company in Famagusta.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In Kashmir valley, 20 militants have been killed in  inter-gang warfare during the last fortnight. The group clashes  between different militant organizations have spread to almost  every district of the valley. Yesterday, a self-styled district  commander of the JKLF [Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front] was  killed by Hizbul Mojahedin at Chandpura in Srinagar. After the  incident, thousands of people came out in the streets in  Srinagar shouting slogans against the militants. Last week  also, a procession was taken out in (Ashmukan) town by local  residents to protest against the activities of the militant  groups.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Titov and Sergey Ivanov: "Twelve Ex-es </F> Instead of Fifteen Friends"]    [Text] We have been living in the CIS since the end of  1991, when the era of the "indestructible Union" came to an end.  The majority of experts have pointed out that the Commonwealth  has gained its "second wind" in the third year of its life. It  is interesting that the same observers were inclined to express  the opposite point of view just recently: It is a powerless  entity, they said, and its days are numbered. They found comfort  in the knowledge that without this entity, the dissolution of  the colossal nuclear power would have taken the form of a  nuclear meltdown, as they put it, instead of a civilized  divorce.... Now they suddenly have realized that the CIS not  only has a right to exist, but that neither Russia nor the  former Soviet republics--Russia's neighbors and partners--can  get along with it. The three Baltic states are no longer a  consideration (they are "self-supporting"), but by the time of  the last conference in Ashgabat, all of the other 12 "ex-es" had  come together in the CIS. The last of them was Georgia, which  had had its fill of the drawbacks of sovereignty in October  1993; Azerbaijan, which had also gone through many ordeals, had  returned to the fold a short time earlier. But here is the  question: Exactly what kind of entity is the CIS--an evolving  system of cooperation and coordination or a means of  communication during the transition period of the "divorce  proceedings"?    There are significant political forces adhering to both  views  in the republics; accordingly, they have different  interpretations of the Commonwealth's purpose and functions, and  this introduces discord into their work. Furthermore, as far as  the general public is concerned, attitudes can quickly undergo a  total reversal, and this is obvious to more than just the  sociological community. During the initial period of the  existence of the CIS, for example, illusions were fostered (and  with some success) "on the local level" to suggest that the main  causes of negative developments could be found at the center,  outside the boundaries of the new sovereign republics. The hopes  for successful economic separation from other parts of the  ex-Union were unjustified, however, and these states did not  acquire more favorable conditions for economic recovery when  they were "on their own."    Recession, impoverishment, social tension, and other such  problems were present almost everywhere in the CIS instead of  the anticipated prosperity. In this unfavorable atmosphere, the  centripetal tendency slowly began to prevail over centrifugal  forces. The belief that the establishment of different levels of  consolidation within the Commonwealth of Independent States  might be the best option in today's difficult circumstances  gradually gained strength among political scientists and  experts, and then among the members of the ruling elite in the  post-Soviet republics.    In the most general terms, the multileveled structure of the  Commonwealth can be described as approximately the following: On  the first level, the lowest, a system of multilateral and  bilateral agreements on mutual preferences is taking shape,  economic and social laws are being coordinated, and the  infrastructure is being standardized. On the second level, the  establishment of the Customs Union will create a duty-free and  license-free zone, a common tax policy is being conducted, and  commitments are being assumed with regard to the unimpeded  movement of people, goods, and capital. The final and third  level of cooperation will be achieved by countries with a common  currency and a supra-governmental mechanism for decisions on the  issuance of currency, crediting, and financial exchange. In this  way, each state belonging to the CIS can choose to be a  confederate or associate member: In each specific case,  everything will depend on the prevailing tendency--centripetal  or centrifugal. Obviously, the former will help a republic "find  its own place" in the Commonwealth, and the second will have an  alienating effect.    What are the contributing and hindering factors? These are  mainly economic factors on both sides. As a rule, grim necessity  prevails over any kind of illusions. Economic conditions in the  CIS countries range from difficult to catastrophic. As long as  the economic zone is in a fragmented state, it will be difficult  to expect improvement, and social indignation will be rampant  because of the cold and hunger.... Only concerted effort can  lift an economy out of the ruins.    What do the advocates of the other, "centrifugal" point of  view want? For them, the priorities of sovereignization have not  lost their luster. They still have hopes for integration within  the framework of a different structure--a more promising  structure, in their opinion, than the CIS. These hopes are  largely impractical and illusory, but they also reflect  disillusionment with the CIS because of its ineffectiveness and  its lack of a mechanism to implement decisions. The leaders who  met at the last regular CIS summit conference approved around 20  documents pertaining to economic spheres of vital  importance--taxes, export-import policy, finances, credit....  This is an indication that the CIS partners acknowledge these  new realities, but as far as the implementation of these  documents is concerned, we will have to wait and see....</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to motor vehicle controls under section 202, EPA has recently adopted or proposed other controls aimed at in-use NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions from mobile sources. The enhanced inspection and maintenance (I/M) rules call for use of these more stringent I/M procedures starting with 1996 [57 FR 52950, November 5, 1992]. EPA has also proposed standards that would limit NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions from new large horsepower diesel non-road engines, pursuant to section 213 of the Act [58 FR 28809, May 17, 1993]. While enhanced I/M programs will directly affect the motor vehicle fleet, the non-road engine regulations are similar to the motor vehicle regulations under section 202 in that they would apply to new non-road engines only, and therefore involve a certain time before a significant portion of this category of non-road engines is replaced by new engines certified to meet the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional mobile source controls, whether under section 202 or under other authority such as described above, may well be cost effective and reasonable options that EPA might decide to adopt. However, there are certain limitations imposed by Congress on adoption of more stringent standards (``Tier 2 standards''). For example, Congress spelled out when and under what conditions EPA may promulgate more stringent NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standards for light-duty vehicles and trucks. Congress required that EPA conduct a study on whether more stringent standards for light-duty vehicles and trucks should be adopted, and report back to Congress no later than June 1, 1997 [section 202(i) (1), (2)]. Based on the study EPA must conduct a rulemaking to determine whether there is a need for such further reductions, whether the technology will be available for such reductions, and whether further reductions in emissions from such vehicles will be cost effective. If these determinations are made in the affirmative, then EPA would proceed to promulgate emissions standards that are more stringent than the Tier 1 standards [section 202(i)(3)(C)]. If EPA does promulgate more stringent standards, they may not take effect any earlier than model year 2004, and no later than model year 2006.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is clear from this that EPA has not, at this time, completed the lengthy process for determining whether or not more stringent standards should be established for light-duty vehicles and trucks under section 202(i). Congress established a detailed provision spelling out the procedures to follow and the substantive determinations that must be made before such controls could be adopted. There is no indication, and EPA does not believe, that these mandated procedures and criteria preclude the exercise of discretion under section 211(c)(1)(A) prior to completion of the rulemaking under section 202(i). Congress required that EPA consider motor vehicle controls, but did not establish a mandatory preference for such controls and did not preclude the adoption of fuel controls prior to a decision on Tier 2 motor vehicle standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In any case, it is clear that a decision to impose more stringent NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standards for light-duty vehicles and trucks under section 202(i) could not take effect prior to model year 2004. It would then take several years before a significant portion of the in-use fleet would include vehicles or trucks certified to a NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standard more stringent than the Tier 1 standard. A similar situation would apply to a more stringent NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standard for heavy-duty engines. The mandatory leadtime and stability provision of section 202(a)(3)(C) would preclude imposition of more stringent NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standards for heavy-duty engines until model year 2001 at the earliest. It would again take several years before a significant portion of the in-use heavy-duty fleet contained engines certified to a more stringent NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standard. For non-road engines and vehicles, EPA expects to continue to explore NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  controls. But as with motor vehicles, any new or more stringent NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standards will only apply to new non-road engines, after providing a reasonable period for leadtime. The effect on in-use emissions is delayed based on the time needed before new non-road engines replace earlier models.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given these circumstances, there are several important reasons why promulgation of a NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reduction standard for reformulated gasoline is important, whether or not additional vehicle or engine controls are later adopted by the Agency. First, emissions reductions from the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  performance standard would start as soon as the standard is applicable, with no delay based on fleet turnover time. Significant NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission reductions would be achieved right away, in the summer of 2000, while more stringent light-duty or heavy-duty standards would not be expected to significantly affect in-use emissions until much later in that decade. Second, a NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reduction standard for reformulated gasoline would act to reduce emissions from all mobile sources that use gasoline, whether on-road or off-road, while section 202 or section 213 standards only act to limit emissions from new engines or vehicles in that specific category of mobile sources. Third, this fuel control is specifically aimed at areas of the country that are in nonattainment for ozone, and is limited in time to that part of the year when ozone is of most concern. Vehicle or engine controls, in contrast, apply to all new engines or vehicles, wherever they are used, throughout the year. This fuel control thus allows a more narrow regulatory solution aimed at the specific geographical areas and time periods when control is needed. Fourth, the expected increase in vehicle miles travelled over time leads EPA to believe that this fuel control is needed to continue to achieve the in-use NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission reductions necessary for many areas of the country to reach attainment for ozone. Finally, the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  fuel standard adopted here minimizes any concern there might be that a fuel control would tend to interfere in the production process by directing refiners on how to make their product. The NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standard is not a fuel recipe, but instead establishes a performance standard, leaving refiners free to produce their gasoline in any way that achieves the desired reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Can Britain Make It: Charting the mechanics of decline - Britain's manufacturing base is shrinking and its trade gap is growing. In the first of a series Andrew Baxter looks at the mechanical engineering sector THE head of a German machine-tool company was asked recently whether he was worried by the pound's devaluation since Black Wednesday. After all, his British competitors in the export markets are now over 15 per cent more competitive. Not at all, he said. But 10 years ago it would have been different. Britain had a machine-tool industry then. The machine-tool sector was a star in the UK balance of payments. Today its story reads like a sad parable of the decline of Britain's mechanical engineering industry. UK industrialists complain that they are forced to buy foreign equipment for their factories or overseas-made kit for a big contracting job. Process plant contractors, for example, say it is no longer possible to buy big UK-produced compressors, a vital component of chemical plants. Mr Neil Johnson, head of the Engineering Employers' Federation, says the only thing wrong with mechanical engineering in the UK is its size. 'The only way of attacking that is to build up our manufacturing capacity.' The problem might seem exaggerated if the bare figures are anything to go by. Last year the UK had an apparently healthy surplus in engineering, with exports 20 per cent larger than imports. The problem is not just the absolute numbers, it is the trend. At the beginning of the 1970s exports were comfortably twice the level of imports. The balance dipped to virtual equilibrium in 1989. It has edged up since, but that is because recession has dented demand for imports. Adjusted for inflation, the numbers tell a similar story. In 1993 money, as calculated by Mr Ian Thompson at the federation, total output has fallen from Pounds 45bn in 1979 to Pounds 33bn last year - in line with that of France but a long way short of the German sector, Europe's biggest. Exports slipped from Pounds 15bn to Pounds 12bn, while imports have risen from Pounds 9bn to Pounds 10bn. Two severe recessions have depressed UK demand. In a shrinking home market companies have rationalised or gone out of business, and have a smaller base from which to make overseas sales. Some good news for the heavy engineering sector came last week with the announcement that Davy International had won a Pounds 200m contract to supply a complete stainless steel rolling mill in South Africa. Most of the equipment will be bought in the UK from suppliers including GEC in Rugby and Bronx Engineering in the west Midlands. The performance of different sectors has varied widely, although none could be called sparkling. Comparing 1990-91 with 1978-79, the worst performer was fabricated and structural steelwork where exports fell 57 per cent and imports surged by 184 per cent. Among the better performers was power equipment, where exports fell 44 per cent and imports dropped by 71 per cent, mainly because of the lack of UK demand. But real progress was made in ball and roller bearings - exports up 23 per cent, imports up 4 per cent. The shrinking of the home customer base produces an effect that cannot be gauged by statistics. In machine tools, for example, the main types of equipment, such as lathes and milling machines, are still built in the UK. But the strength - until recently - of markets in Germany, Japan and Switzerland has allowed companies there to offer much fuller product ranges. UK companies have also been hit by newly industrialised countries. Previously captive export markets in countries that formerly were part of the British empire, especially in Asia, have built up their own industries. So how can Britain improve its trade performance? One answer is to follow the example set by the motor industry and attract inward investment. The improvement in ball and roller bearings largely results from heavy investment by Japanese companies. Engineering companies frequently complain that they have not received the support, in terms of trade finance and market intelligence, that has been available to their competitors in other European countries, notably Germany, for winning overseas business. Mr Johnson insists that it would be wrong to be too gloomy. The UK, he argues, is one of the most attractive countries for companies that want to establish a European presence. In addition, he says, the UK already has world leaders to build on. In the short term, there is excess production capacity of 20 per cent to 40 per cent that can be soaked up as the world recovers from recession. Going beyond that, however, needs new investment. The history of the past 20 years suggests that will be harder than it sounds.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (8): State of the economy - Interview, Manmohan Singh FINANCE Minister Dr Manmohan Singh replies to questions put to him by Stefan Wagstyl: QUESTION: How do you assess the current performance of the Indian economy? DR SINGH: The performance so far has been in line with our expectations. The only slightly disappointing factor has been that the upsurge in industrial production is not as good as we would like it. But export performance has been very good. Exports were up by nearly 28 per cent in the first four months of the year (the financial year, starting in April). That is most encouraging. If exports continue to do well and the monsoon is good then it will help industrial production. But quite honestly, there's a problem because industries such as steel and cement are partly dependent on demand from the public sector. And public sector demand (because of efforts to control public spending) is not rising as fast as we would like. THE fiscal deficit seems to be expanding above the targets that you set. Are you concerned about it? For the time being the fiscal system is not behaving in the manner we would like. The deficit could be 5.7 per cent or 5.8 per cent of the economy if we don't make any corrections. As of now we would overshoot (our target of 4.7 per cent). But we can take action once these elections are out of the way. (Elections to be held in four states where state assemblies were suspended and central rule imposed after the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque.) MIGHT you act by cutting subsidies for publicly-distributed food? Fortunately the macroeconomic situation is good. We could reduce subsidies by selling (government-held) food stocks in the open market. We are considering this. But we cannot act until after the state elections because for the moment the politicians are worried about the fall-out of any action we might take. I don't think the Indian people would mind but politicians everywhere have this preoccupation with the short-term. They believe that if you care for the short-term, the long term will take care of itself. That's a problem of all democratic political systems. After the elections, we won't be able to recover all the lost ground (on the fiscal deficit) but we can act. WILL the increase in the deficit create difficulties with either the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank, which are monitoring the Indian economy? I don't think it will create problems. The significance of the fiscal deficit is its effect on inflation and the balance of payments. On both of these our performance is very good. Our export performance is impressive. Also, (the IMF and the Bank) recognise that we are working with the reality of a vigorous democracy. No other fact is more important than this. Certainly today there's more support for the programme than there was when we started. But even in countries where central leadership is strong, reforms run into difficulties. In India, on structural reform what we have said we have done. Given the democratic nature of our political system, it's a miracle we have got this far. DOES India still require financial support from the International Monetary Fund? Our foreign exchange reserves are high, about Dollars 7.2bn or Dollars 7.3bn. That is higher than we expected. So we have no immediate need. But we are interested in a medium term programme. The question is when we tie it up. Probably after the (February) Budget. HOW can India move public resources from subsidies, such as those paid to state-owned enterprises, to meeting basic needs such as education and health? We have reduced subsidies very substantially. We reduced spending on development in the last two years but this year we have increased it. We are trying to make good the lost momentum of the last two years. INDIA has partly liberalised imports and exports in the past two years. What are your plans for further trade reform? A strong open (world) trading system would greatly help the efforts of Indian industry. But if India unilaterally disarms when the rest of the world is becoming more protectionist then what would be the result? That's a worry. Nevertheless, we are stil committed to further tariff reform. We have to carry the public with us. It will be easier as industry gains confidence (about competing in world markets). WHAT changes can we expect in the next few months? We are opening up financial services to foreign companies. I expect a committee examining the insurance industry to report soon. There's a need for change there. We have a lot of work to do with restructuring banks. Private companies are interested in starting banks but they are still talking about this to the Reserve Bank of India. In all these areas we will make progress. WHAT possibility is there that the government will start to privatise the country's large, and often loss-making, public enterprises? We have to appreciate that our party (Congress (I)) has been the ruling party for the past 46 years. It is a party with a (socialist-inclined) ideology. It takes time to change the thinking. The government is now committed to privatising power distribution in Delhi itself. Telecommunications (a state monopoly) has been opened up. We hope for more progress in the next two years. We can privatise if it does not lead to the loss of jobs. That is the limit to reform in a country like ours. It certainly restricts the pace of change. Two things matter to ordinary people. One is food prices; the other trade unions. BUT surely, organised labour accounts for only a small proportion of Indian workers? But we can't mobilise the other 95 per cent. Trade unions are well organised and well entrenched. In the cities they are powerful. If you take them on head-on you risk having the reforms derailed altogether. You have to take every step taking account of what can be done. Tactics have to be sensitive to the need of the moment. SO is the pace of reform slowing? I would say financial sector reforms are making good progress. Trade sector reforms also. If we can control inflation and no jobs are lost we can deal with the other things (including reform of public sector enterprise.) In the last two years we have decisively de-ideologised the debate over reform (and so made progress). But if I create inflation, or increase the fiscal deficit or create a very substantial amount of unemployment then I am in trouble. People have to be confident of their jobs and food and prices. HAVE political events such as the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque diverted attention from reform? We presented the budget after Ayodhya. We carried forward the reform process. The prime minister is committed to reform. But the economy doesn't function in a political vacuum. So time spent on Ayodhya and other things has diverted attention. Also if we had not had the financial scam (last year's scandal in the Bombay securities market), the time could have been spent more productively.</p>

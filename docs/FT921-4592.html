			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Letter: False terms pose danger Sir, 'Moslems ready to take on Serbs in Sarajevo' (March 4) asserts that Greece opposes international recognition of an independent state on its northern border bearing the name 'Macedonia' for fear that this will stir 'Macedonian' nationalism in northern Greece. Greece fears 'Macedonian' nationalism in Greek Macedonia as much as it fears 'Pelopponesian' nationalism in the Pelopponese, 'Thessalian' nationalism in Thessaly and so on. That is not the danger. The real danger lies in the expansionism implicit in the attempt of a small multi-lingual, multi-ethnic Yugoslav republic artificially created by Tito in 1945 to usurp and monopolise a historical Greek name and to claim territories of neighbouring countries under false pretexts. Rather than providing support for Skopje's absurd and provocative views, we feel that, in the interests of peace and stability, such articles should avoid misleading and dangerous terminology.

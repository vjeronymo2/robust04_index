			<p>BFN     [Text] Madrid, April 15 (AFP) -- Moscow was informed of  the United Nations' intention to order air strikes near Gorazde  before they were carried out, UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali said here Friday [15 April].    "We told the Russian authorities before the use of this air  support," Butrus-Ghali told a press conference held jointly with  Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez.    He explained why he had not revealed this earlier by saying:  "I only received this information recently."    Moscow protested vehemently following Sunday and Monday's  air  strikes near the besieged eastern Bosnian Moslem enclave that  they had not been informed before they were launched.    Western leaders subsequently said no government had been  told  before the strikes were launched, because they needed to be  carried out urgently, and insisted that the order to launch them  had been taken under a previously-agreed system.    Butrus-Ghali, who arrived here Wednesday for an official  three-day visit, again defended the UN decision to call for  North Atlantic Treaty Organisation air strikes, saying he would  do so again if necessary.    "We will not hesitate to call on NATO to protect UN forces  if  they are in danger," he said, speaking in French. "It is a very  clear warning to all those in former Yugoslavia who try to  oppose the actions of UN forces."    He reiterated that UN Security Council Resolution 836  allowed  him to call for air action, and said that the Russian Federation  had accepted the resolution.</p>

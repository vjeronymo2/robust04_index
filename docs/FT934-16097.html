			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Birth control implant launched A CONTRACEPTIVE implant designed to prevent pregnancy for up to five years will be available in the UK from next week. The introduction of Norplant was welcomed by the Family Planning Association as an important 'extension of contraceptive choice for women'. Norplant consists of six small rubber tubes, each about the size of a matchstick, which are inserted under local anaesthetic beneath the skin of the upper arm. They release levonorgestrel, a hormone used in contraceptive pills, at a steady rate into the bloodstream for as long as five years. If the women wants to have a baby, the capsules are removed. Its greatest advantage is that women do not have to remember to take a pill every day. Norplant was developed by Leiras, a contraceptive manufacturer in Finland, and the Population Council, a charity based in New York. They are licensing it for sale by various international drug companies. American Home Products, the US licensee, has sold Norplant to 750,000 women since its launch two years ago. The UK licensee is French-owned Roussel, which will charge the National Health Service Pounds 179 for Norplant - significantly below the Dollars 350 (Pounds 232) US price.</p>

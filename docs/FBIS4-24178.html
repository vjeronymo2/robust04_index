			<p>BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, 25 Jun (AFP) -- Zaire's radical opposition  and its press organs today continued to sharply criticize French  intervention in Rwanda.    The government team formed in August 1992 by Mr. Etienne  Tshisekedi, which continues to claim to be the "legitimate  government of Zaire," published a communique which "strongly  condemns this criminal and neocolonialist intervention,"  considered "an insult to the whole of Africa." The communique,  which described itself as a report "on a cabinet meeting held on  23 June under the chairmanship of Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi, prime  minister and head of government," also condemns "the violation  of Zairian territory by French troops."    Pro-opposition newspapers have condemned the French  intervention with very critical headlines and commentaries.  Writing under the heading, "The Recolonization Has Begun," LE  PHARE lashes out: "Beware of the Somalia and Vietnam Syndromes."  LE POTENTIEL reported on its front page: "Invasion of Rwanda  From Zaire," while LE TEMPETE DES TROPIQUES calls on the  national and international community not to fall into "the trap"  (....) of all-out disinformation" and not to see "in French  fascism a mission of good omen."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 9 (YONHAP) -- Despite Moscow's  willingness to allow the resettlement in South Korea of North  Koreans who escaped from logging yards in Siberia, the chances  of their coming to Seoul soon remain slim.    "If we allow them in, it would certainly offend North Korea  and have an adverse impact on overall inter-Korean relations," a  Foreign Ministry official said Saturday.    Russian Vice Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov said in New  Delhi Friday that if Seoul agreed, Russia would send all escaped  North Korean loggers to South Korea.    The ministry official said that if South Korea allowed the  escaped loggers to come, it would set off an avalanche of  would-be asylum seekers, a development certain to alarm the  Pyongyang regime.    President Kim Yong-sam said Thursday that about 90 North  Korean loggers had applied at the South Korean Embassy in Moscow  for asylum in South Korea.    "But we are not accepting them under a policy not to offend  North Korea, and there will be no change in this policy for a  considerable period of time," Kim said.    The ministry official said that accepting North Korean  loggers at this stage would involve a set of complicated  problems.    In addition to offending Pyongyang, he said, there would be  the problem of raising funds for their resettlement, of handling  outlaws among the escaped loggers, and of similarly accepting  loggers who manage to enter China.    "We must cope with the question prudently and flexibly from  a  far-reaching viewpoint in consideration of future developments  in inter-Korean relations," an official at the National  Unification Board said.</p>

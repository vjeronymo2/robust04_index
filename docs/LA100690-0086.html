			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CANYON OVERCOMES INJURIES TO WIN, 21-6  </P> <P> Canyon High had a bye last week and came into Friday night's game against  Leuzinger hungry for action.  </P> <P> The Cowboys won easily, 21-6, but the game left a bad taste in Coach Harry  Welch's mouth.  </P> <P> Welch's 5-0 team -- ranked No. 1 in the Valley -- already had lost top running  back David McDivitt to a thigh bruise. Against Leuzinger (3-2), replacement  Mark Santos dislocated his shoulder and Jeff Bernards suffered a probable  concussion.  </P> <P> "We're pretty banged up," said Welch, whose team begins Golden League play  against Quartz Hill next week. "We need a running back to get healthy."  </P> <P> Quarterback Kevin Bialas provided most of host Canyon's offense, completing six  of 15 passes for 70 yards and two touchdowns. He ran 11 times for 27 yards.  </P> <P> Leuzinger helped out too, providing the Cowboys with excellent field position  in the first half for Canyon's three scores.  </P> <P> Midway through the first quarter, the Olympians' Donal Byrd fumbled a punt and  Canyon's Joey McKeon recovered at the Leuzinger 19.  </P> <P> Two plays later, Bialas threw nine yards to Chris Spahr for a touchdown and a  7-0 lead.  </P> <P> Leuzinger came roaring back with a five-play, 67-yard drive. Marvin Johnson cut  back against the grain and ran for 49 yards, and quarterback Gary Mumin  followed with a four-yard touchdown run. The score was 7-6.  </P> <P> But the game was never close again. Twice Canyon returned short punts deep into  Leuzinger territory and the Cowboys took advantage by scoring two touchdowns in  a three-minute span.  </P> <P> Bernards ran 10 yards for one score. Bialas threw 20 yards to Spahr for the  other. Canyon led 21-6 at halftime.  </P> <P> The Cowboys' defense dominated the second half as McKeon came up with an  interception, his fifth in five games. Leuzinger was held to 116 yards in  offense.  </P> <P> As if to punctuate its victory, Canyon mounted a 17-play drive that failed to  produce a score but chewed up all but two minutes of the fourth quarter.  </P></p>

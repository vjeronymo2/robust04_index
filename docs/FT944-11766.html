			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Arts: Today's Television Somebody once said that when people stop believing in god they don't start believing in nothing, they start believing in anything. If you plot the decline of religious belief in Britain against the rise in 'new age' nonsense there appears to be a lot of truth in this. Even quite serious newspapers and magazines now run features on 'your stars', and television is increasingly keen on ooky-spooky programmes about the supernatural. The most recent is Strange But True? a title which leaves room for doubt in its printed form, with that question mark on the end, but which becomes an assertion of fact when pronounced by presenter Michael Aspel (8.30 ITV). Friday night is still movie night and the best of today's offerings is The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre (12.15 BBC2). Unsurprisingly it is one of the titles mentioned in the Favourite Films programme at 9.30. The guest is Anjelica Huston whose father and grandfather both won Oscars for the picture, John for screenplay and direction, Walter as best supporting actor. The story is set in the Mexican gold rush.</p>

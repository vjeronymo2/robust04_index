			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Economic Viewpoint: An old alternative to conviction politics Do you believe in coming as close to equality in property and income as we can? Or do you prefer an enterprise society, or a nation of inheritors? Do you think that inflation is caused by too much money chasing too few goods? Or by struggles between groups for incompatible shares of the national product? Should punishment fit the crime or the criminal? This is a random assortment of disputed questions. What they have in common is that they have been argued by men and women of goodwill for decades - sometimes for centuries - and we are no nearer a consensus. One prominent politician on the Conservative side, when faced with Big Questions, is inclined to ask whether he has to decide or at least decide now. I do know a book which attempts to provide such agnostics with a good conscience; and I have been waiting to review it for well over 20 years. It was jointly written by an American professor of politics, Charles Lindblom, and a philosopher, David Braybrooke. It is called A Strategy of Decision, and was first published in 1963. My own version is dated 1969. I have often thought about it in the intervening years, but am only now beginning to make up my mind about it. The authors believe that the method of evaluation which is directly or indirectly taught to undergraduates or even business leaders on courses is misconceived. They call the orthodox approach 'synoptic' or 'rational-deductive'. It involves people setting out their ideals, equipping themselves with a set of cause-and-effect relations, and then examining the facts to decide. Its defect, they believe, is that people will not merely disagree on values. They often do not know what their values are until a specific problem arises. People who can agree on inequity in a tax system - eg the poll tax - will not necessarily agree what equity is. The authors' preferred alternative is known as - wait for it - 'disjointed incrementalism'. This may explain why their ideas are not on the lips of US presidential candidates. They admit that the English 'piecemeal social engineering' is a close approximation. What they mean is that instead of choosing between great principles, policymakers should go straight to specific decisions. Not, for instance: is there a right to freedom of information? But will the disclosure of membership of cabinet committees do more for free inquiry than harm to efficient government? The authors' essential point is that people who disagree on fundamentals can still agree on specific steps. You do not have to agree on equality or inequality to want to help those living in cardboard boxes. I remember consciously thinking about Braybrooke and Lindblom during the disputes between Margaret Thatcher and Nigel Lawson on exchange rate policy. It often occurred to me - indeed I wrote - that it ought to be possible to agree on whether to raise or lower interest rates, without agreeing on whether a specific move was made to protect sterling or in reaction to some measure of the domestic money supply - even, dare one say, agreeing to disagree on the reasons. Such piecemeal accommodations are not facilitated, however, by big, bold, but essentially vacuous statements such as: 'You cannot buck the market.' There is one thought which encapsulates the American authors' critique. It is: do not insist on fundamental justification. You might agree with raising interest rates in a boom or reducing them in a slump without deciding if you are a monetarist or a Keynesian, let alone an exchange rate monetarist or a parochial one. Most political practitioners or committee chairman types would probably regard A Strategy of Decision as a pretentious academic description of a strategy they had been practising all their professional lives. Yet it is a little more than this. What the US academics were saying is: 'Rest easy with what you are doing. You are not cutting corners or sacrificing principles. This is the only way even political theorists think you can decide.' The book betrays its age, however, in its tacit assumption that the disputes are mostly about values and that 'social scientists' have a good deal of knowledge about how the world works. In recent years the disputes have been about both, or about ideologies in which the two have been inextricably mixed together. The main objection to the 'strategy' is that it discourages more profound reflection. The authors make much of the need to decide how much inflation it is worth incurring to alleviate unemployment by so much here and now. Later evidence and analysis suggested that there was no long-run trade-off between the two. Anyone who had taken the 'strategy of decision' too much to heart would have found himself (as governments did) with accelerating inflation and no lasting improvement in jobs. Indeed, 'disjointed incrementalism' actually tells practitioners to cut off the chain of consequences at an early stage. The authors' buzzwords are 'limited', 'incremental', 'remedial' and 'successive approximation'. They thus encourage unreflective interventionism and disjointed lists of points characteristic of political manifesto writers. It is therefore open to the charge of short-termism by disciples of Hayek, who warned about the adverse long-run effect of a host of specific interventions. But it is also vulnerable to social critics who worry about the spillover effects of a market system, on our culture and on the ecological balance, and who consider piecemeal corrections inadequate. What should one conclude? During periods of 'conviction politics', one is conscious of the fallibility of those exercising the convictions. During a period of piecemeal social engineering, one begins to long for the 'vision thing'. The nearest I can come to a resolution is that policymakers should practise disjointed incrementalism - as most of them are in any case inclined to do, like Moliere's bourgeois gentilhomme who had been unwittingly talking prose all his life - while there should be a vigorous debate among the clerisy on fundamentals. The distinctions need not be rigid. A former prime minister, Arthur Balfour, had views on the Nature of Reality - which hardly committed the cabinet - and chancellors (and even presidents) have had views on How the World Economy Works. My suggestion is that they should erect Chinese walls between their various activities. Let Michael Heseltine give lectures on why manufacturing matters, and let Peter Lilley explain why all goods and services have equal importance at the margin in a competitive market. But when it comes to policy, both should go as far as they can without having to decide on fundamentals. That way both theorists and policymakers can feel a little easier; and one person in his time can play several parts.</p>

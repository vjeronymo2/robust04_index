			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (4): Big carrot, little stick - US has ambitious policies. Frank McGurty asks if they will work Environmentalists contend that President Clinton's plan to respond to the threat of global warming contains too much carrot and not enough stick. Conservatives say it is an overwrought response to non-existent crisis. But most agree on at least one point - the programme, unveiled amid great fanfare a year ago, is comprehensive. It sets forth dozens of separate initiatives aimed at controlling emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other gases, which some scientists believe could drastically alter climate conditions. The initial goal is to roll back over the next six years the amount of so-called 'greenhouse' gases discharged into the atmosphere to 1990 levels. Without any action, emission levels would increase 7 per cent by the turn of the century, according to the administration's projections. From its inception, it was virtually certain 'the climate change action plan', as it is known, would run up against at least some obstacles. Indeed, in committing the US for the first time to a specific goal and timetable on reducing greenhouse emissions, the president was launching a plan as sweeping and potentially contentious as his ill-starred scheme to reform the US healthcare system. A year later, the environmental plan is alive and well, in sharp contrast to healthcare reform, which is currently trapped in political limbo after a fierce partisan battle in Congress. During a legislative session when many of the president's proposals were thwarted, the package survived largely intact, with 40 out of 47 of its original proposals winning approval. 'Overall, compared to where we were a year ago - when it was simply a proposal - the plan has been a very substantial success in terms of beginning to address these issues,' says Mr Wesley Warren, associate director of the White House Office on Environmental Policy, which is overseeing a plan that involves six separate federal agencies. Keeping the programme afloat may indeed qualify as a success for the president, but the start has not been entirely smooth. With both houses of Congress to be controlled by the opposition Republicans, the next steps in implementing the plan are sure to prove more difficult. Already for fiscal 1995, the Democratic-controlled Congress slashed the proposed appropriations for the plan. There is also evidence to suggest the administration has underestimated the magnitude of the problem. Its response, if fully funded, could prove inadequate to the initial goal. It is much too early to judge whether the specific initiatives are living up to their advance billing. Many of them have been up and running for only a month. Nevertheless, even critics of some aspects of the programme credit the administration with getting most of its proposals off the ground. 'In general, the plan is moving in the right direction,' says Mr Daniel Lashof, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental lobbying group. The package embraces a pot-pourri of programmes, many of them aimed at striking partnerships between the private and public sectors. The initiatives range from adjustments in tax policy on employer-paid parking privileges to measures to encourage better management of forests, which combat global warming by absorbing carbon after it has been released into the atmosphere. But the cornerstone of the plan is a multi-faceted effort to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases at their source. Energy efficiency is considered crucial because fossil fuel consumption by homes, offices and factories is responsible for more than 85 per cent of US greenhouse emissions. Many of the plan's initiatives simply expand on existing projects. The Environmental Protection Agency's Green Lights programme, launched three years ago, offers technical support to businesses which are considering upgrading their lighting systems. This year 400 new organisations have signed up, bringing the total to about 1,600. With each participant realising an average 45 per cent decline in energy use, the EPA has stepped up its recruitment drive by targeting universities, churches and other non-profit groups. 'Green Lights has a solid track record which demonstrates that these types of programmes work,' says Mr Lashof. Other projects would put fresh ideas into play. Among the most promising is the Department of Energy's initiative to develop new energy-efficiency standards for 11 residential appliances. But in at least one case - hot water heaters - the electric industry is vigorously opposing the adoption of new rules, which would encourage the use of a more efficient type of gas-fired heaters. 'That calls into question whether the industry is willing to co-operate beyond the level of lip service,' says Mr Lashof. The issue is particularly germane because the administration has chosen to highlight its relationship with the electric industry as evidence that its non-confrontational strategy is working well. The response to the DOE's Climate Challenge is a special source of pride. More than 800 electric utilities, which represent 80 per cent of US generating capacity, have agreed to undertake voluntary measures to reduce their greenhouse emissions, employing a flexible array of options. The White House projects Dollars 60bn in private investment in energy-savings technology by the end of the decade, against a commitment of just Dollars 1.9bn in federal funds, some of which is to be redirected from other areas. But public spending is already falling short of the original target. For fiscal 1995, the plan was granted budget authority of only Dollars 232m, much less than the Dollars 344m sought by the president. The DOE, the most important agency involved in the programme, was given a little more than half its Dollars 208m request. Last May, Ms Hazel O'Leary, the US energy secretary, told a Senate committee that deep cuts in funding 'would make the president's commitment virtually impossible to meet'. The White House declined to comment specifically on how spending reductions might affect the plan, but Mr Warren said the administration would press for extra funding in subsequent years to make up for the shortfall in fiscal 1995. However, with the Republicans likely to seek cuts in federal income taxes, and perhaps an amendment to the US constitution to require balanced federal budgets, funds are most likely to be even more tight as the emissions deadline nears. Environmentalists such as Mr Lashof also question whether the adminstration's plan has underestimated the likely rate at which greenhouse emissions will increase in the coming years, assuming no action is taken. Since the plan was unveiled a year ago, both private and government economists have lifted their estimates of 1994 gross domestic product to more than 3 per cent, from early forecasts of less than 2.5 per cent. At the same time, the price of crude oil has fluctuated without showing any big net increase; the administration assumed higher prices in its emission projections. If the economy continues to outperform the forecasts and oil prices stay low, the natural demand for fossil fuels would surely accelerate, making the challenge of reducing emissions to 1990 levels even more daunting than a year ago. Such questions are to be addressed squarely in about a year. The White House has promised to re-evaluate and, if necessary, modify the climate programme next autumn to keep the emission reductions on track. 'We are simply not going to look at this on a month-to-month basis,' Mr Warren says.</p>

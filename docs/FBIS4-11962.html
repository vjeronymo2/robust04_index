			<p>BFN     [Text] A Fatah member from Khan Yunus was killed this  evening as he was assembling a bomb in the Khan Yunus refugee  camp. The victim is Khalid Halabi, who spent eight years in an  Israeli prison because of his Fatah membership. His body was  snatched away from the hospital.    Our correspondent Shlomi Eldar adds that shots were fired  this evening at an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] lookout position  in al-Shaykh Radwan. Nobody was hurt. The Fatah Hawks claimed  responsibility for this attempted terrorist attack.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1900 GMT on 2 April  adds: "An Israeli was lightly injured in the head this evening  when his car came under a hail of stones in the village of  al-Jib south of Ramallah. Two border policemen were injured:  one in Qalqilyah and another in Gaza.    ["Riots erupted this evening in the al-Burayj refugee camp.  In Gaza, an explosive charge was thrown at a police station.

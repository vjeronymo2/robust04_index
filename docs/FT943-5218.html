			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Israel takes a global approach to privatisation - International offerings After decades of being overlooked by international investors, Israel is preparing to emerge from obscurity with a series of international equity offerings. Progress towards peace in the region and the easing of the Arab boycott have greatly reduced the political risks which have been associated with the country for so long. At the same time, the favour-able economic outlook has made Israeli stocks an attractive alternative to other fast-growing economies in southern Europe, Asia and Latin America. However, apart from a dedicated following in New York, where some 50 mainly hi-tech Israeli companies are listed, foreign holdings of Israeli equities are low. At present only 2 per cent of the Israeli stock market is estimated to be owned by foreigners, a significant proportion of which is made up of BZW Investment Management's Israel Fund. In the past, the Israeli government has not sought international capital when it sold off stakes in state-owned companies because of the strong demand from domestic investors. However, the poor performance of the stock market this year and a diversion of savings into a buoyant property market have encouraged it to pursue a more global strategy. Last week, the Government Companies Authority, the official body charged with selling state-owned companies, said it had chosen Wertheim Schroder, part of the UK merchant bank and fund management group Schroders, to act as financial adviser to the sale of shares in Israel Chemicals (ICL), the country's leading chemical and fertiliser company. The government plans to sell 32 per cent of ICL, which is currently valued at around Dollars 850m, through an international public offering and 15 per cent to a single or a group of private investors. Bankers believe that the offering, which would leave the government with a 28 per cent stake, will take place during the first quarter of next year. In the meantime, Morgan Stanley has been selected to advise on the international offering of shares in Bezek, the telecommunications company. The government wishes to sell 25 per cent of the company, which would lower its stake to 51 per cent. The sale, which is likely to go ahead by May next year, could raise between Dollars 600m and Dollars 700m. Observers say that at present, Bezek is less prepared for privatisation than ICL, largely due to the uncertainty about the government's intention to break Bezek's monopoly on international phone calls. Another candidate for privatisation is El Al, the state-owned airline, The government, which intends to sell 51 per cent of the company through the Tel Aviv stock exchange and through an international offering, has appointed BZW to conduct a valuation of the airline. Three problems obstruct El Al's privatisation. First, the government wants to keep a golden stake to protect state interests and the exact scope of this has yet to be defined. Second, it must also determine what to do about the airline's Dollars 55m annual security costs, 80 per cent of which are currently met by the government. Third, the government must decide whether to remove legislation which bans El Al from Sabbath flights. The ban on flying between dusk on Friday and dusk on Saturday cost the company an estimated Dollars 30m to Dollars 40m in profit last year. Officials say these issues should be resolved in time for El Al to be floated by mid-1995.</p>

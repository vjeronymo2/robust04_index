			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Allies debate how best to contain Iraq The US last night appeared to back away from its proposal for a military exclusion zone in southern Iraq as the best means of containing the long-term threat to Kuwait posed by Iraq. The plan had earlier met with strong opposition from France, with Mr Francois Leotard, the French defence minister, saying there was 'nothing illegal in the movement of Iraqi forces inside Iraq'. Russia and China were also believed to be unenthusiastic about the proposal. A US official at the United Nations in New York said that, instead of the exclusion zone, Washington was considering introducing a UN Security Council resolution to forbid Iraq from deploying elite units with an offensive potential in areas where they could threaten Kuwait. 'We want to return to the status quo ante,' said the official. This would see Iraq reduce its forces in southern Iraq to the level they were at before the build-up began last week. In spite of Iraq's claims that it had withdrawn all its forces from the border area, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said in Kuwait yesterday that remaining troops still posed 'an unmistakable threat'. The US has refused to rule out a pre-emptive strike. US officials had not made public their proposals for a military exclusion zone, but it was thought likely to have mirrored the 'no-fly' zone south of the 32nd parallel beyond which Iraqi aircraft risked being attacked by allied aircraft. Mr Christopher arrived in Kuwait for talks with Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, and the six-nation Gulf Co-operation Council. Afterwards, Mr Christopher, flanked by Mr Hurd, Prince Saud al-Faisal, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, and Sheikh Fahim bin-Sultan al-Qasimi, secretary-general of the GCC, said four main agreements had been reached: Iraq's troops must abandon their threatening posture. Never again would Iraq be allowed to disturb the peace in the region and seek to intimidate the UN. 'We have agreed to an equitable share of the costs' (of allied military deployment). Each of the GCC countries would provide overflying rights for aircraft of the allied forces. The GCC would contribute units from its Peninsula Shield force to protect Kuwait. Almost 40,000 US troops are either in the Gulf or on their way there with another 155,000 on standby. Mr Christopher emphasised there could be no lifting of UN sanctions against Iraq. He said the allies had expressed 'great sympathy for the people of Iraq' but the responsibility for their condition lay with Mr Saddam. 'The facts speak for themselves,' he said. 'Saddam Hussein has impoverished his country and dishonoured its military.' The Iraqi leader should be in no doubt that if he continued a policy of intimidation 'Iraq will be devastated'. Mr Christopher said there were signs of some Iraqi troop withdrawals from the border area, but it was too soon to say the crisis was over. There was among the allies 'a total lack of trust in what Saddam Hussein says'. Mr Hurd said the UK was happy to support Kuwait 'because we believe in standing by our friends and because the UK retains a strong interest in the stability of this area'. Iraq remained adamant that it would not recognise Kuwait until economic sanctions were eased. Mr Leotard said he believed the deployment of US forces 'was not unconnected to domestic politics'. However, he added: 'We are demanding that Iraq recognise the international border with Kuwait,' as laid down in UN resolutions. France was striking a 'delicate' balance between recognising that Iraq had made some efforts to conform with some UN resolutions and being 'intransigent' that Baghdad must in the end fulfil all such resolutions, Mr Leotard claimed.

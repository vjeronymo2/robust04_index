			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / EU tightens beef controls European Union agriculture ministers yesterday agreed tighter controls against 'mad cow' disease (BSE) in an effort to divert German threats to ban imports of British beef. The ministers, meeting in Brussels, backed a package of measures from Mr Rene Steichen, agriculture commissioner, including extending to all member states a ban on the use of meat and bone meal in cattle feed. A ban has been in place in Britain since 1988. 'It should be sufficient to dispel any fears the German farm minister (Mr Jochen Borchert) might have had,' said Mr Steichen. The measures proposed by Mr Steichen include raising temperatures in the meat rendering process, restricting the use of meat by-products in cosmetics and ensuring checks in all member states to detect BSE. However, pressure for a unilateral ban on British beef imports has come from Mr Horst Seehofer, German health minister. Bonn argues that it is not certain that humans are not at risk from BSE. Mr Seehofer will discuss the issue further with his EU counterparts at a health ministers' meeting tomorrow.</p>

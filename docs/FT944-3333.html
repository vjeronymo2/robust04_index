			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Construction industry suffers big fall in orders Prospects for a significant improvement in demand for construction work this year are waning as official statistics released today show building activity tapering off. Department of the Environment figures indicate that activity in the public sector plummeted in the third quarter, with the housing and infrastructure sectors showing big falls in orders compared with last year. Contractors believe this signals an end to the upward trend in order levels seen in the past year. The future does not look much brighter. Mr Christopher Vickers, construction spokesman for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said cuts in the roads programme and the chancellor's over-reliance on the private finance initiative would do little to maintain workload levels in the public sector next year. Statistics showed that, at constant 1990 prices, public housing and housing association orders in the third quarter were 24 per cent lower than in the previous three months and 36 per cent lower than in the comparable period last year. Infrastructure orders fell 33 per cent compared with the previous three months and 39 per cent compared with the corresponding period last year. This was offset by a steady rise in orders for new work in the private commercial and industrial sectors. The total volume of new orders was 1 per cent higher than the previous three months but 1 per cent lower than a year ago. The slowdown in orders has not yet filtered through to building material producers, and figures released yesterday by the institution show that building prices were 11 per cent higher than a year ago. The organisation estimated that building prices across the country rose 3.4 per cent in the three months to the end of September. Prices were expected to rise 5.6 per cent in the next 12 months and 4.5 per cent the following year. Mr Vickers said tender prices had reacted to the rising costs of site labour, materials and sub-contractors. He thought that in the short term increases in input costs, particularly labour, would fuel further prices rises. Mr Vickers believed, however, that by the end of the year the situation would change and there would be an easing of tender price inflation.</p>

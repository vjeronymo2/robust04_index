			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Premiers to discuss Ulster security The British and Irish prime ministers are to meet at Downing Street tomorrow to review cross-border security and progress on their Northern Ireland peace initiative. The meeting follows a renewed surge of violence by both the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland, and a failed but potentially devastating bomb attack in Dublin last weekend by the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force. Dublin officials said that tomorrow's meeting had been arranged before the upsurge in violence, to coincide with other functions the Irish prime minister has planned in London and Oxford. New security measures are expected to include additional police checkpoints on roads north of Dublin and leading from the border. Police and army chiefs were in talks throughout yesterday and the army said that additional troops 'will be available to support the Gardai as required'. Up to 2,000 of Ireland's 13,000 troops are deployed on border security duties at any one time, supported by helicopters, spotter planes and bomb-disposal teams. On average some 35 checkpoints on border roads are manned by army personnel every day, and more than 30 patrols per day are carried out along the border. Any movements of commercial explosives - from the time they enter the country to their moment of detonation - are escorted and monitored by army personnel. Yesterday, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, sought to emphasise that next month's European election should not be treated in the province as a referendum on the Downing Street Declaration. Launching the Conservative party manifesto in Belfast, Sir Patrick said the election mattered because it was about 'our jobs and our identity'. He said Britain's opt-out from the 'suffocating' social chapter of the Maastricht treaty meant more jobs for Ulster, a region plagued by high unemployment.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Japan's current account  surplus for fiscal 1993 rose an unadjusted 3.3 percent from the  previous year to hit a record for the second consecutive year,  the Finance Ministry said in a preliminary report Monday [9 May].    The politically sensitive surplus that represents trade in  goods and services totaled 130.04 billion dollars, the ministry  said. But for the latest reporting month of March alone, the  unadjusted current account gap fell 16.1 percent from a  year-earlier level to 15.76 billion dollars, underscoring the  recent downward trend.    The fiscal 1993 unadjusted trade surplus -- the major  component --on a contract settlement basis increased 4.9 percent  to 142.80 billion dollars, with exports gaining 6.1 percent to  356.00 billion dollars and imports rising 6.9 percent to 213.20  billion dollars, the ministry said.    The March contract-settled trade surplus fell 0.7 percent to  15.22 billion dollars, with exports gaining 5.3 percent to 35.61  billion dollars and imports climbing 10.3 percent to 20.39  billion dollars.</p>

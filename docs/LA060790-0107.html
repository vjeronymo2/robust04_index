			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> SUMMER JOBS PROGRAM  </P> <P> The Board of Directors on Tuesday voted to sponsor a $120,000 summer jobs  program for youths from the Northwest area of the city.  </P> <P> Using federal Community Development Block Grants, the program will target 50  college-bound youths from the area. The idea is to help the students "hit the  ground running" by allowing them to earn up to $2,000 from summer work,  Director Chris Holden said.  </P> <P> The program will place students in such city offices as the city attorney's  office and the Department of Water and Power, with an emphasis on jobs related  to the environment, Holden said. "We didn't want to give them just maintenance  jobs at minimum wage," he added.  </P></p>

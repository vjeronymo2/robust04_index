			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions Directors' buying in Rhino Group (formerly JMD), the home entertainment and video games company, was highlighted back in October when directors bought stock in the open offer and placing. The shares have performed strongly since and the most recent purchase is worth more than Pounds 100,000. Two directors - Anthony Solomons, chairman, and Archibald Walker, a non-executive - have bought stock in Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant bank. Neither owned shares in the group prior to these transactions. In Ewart, the property company, the sale by Philip Monahan coincided with his resignation from the board. Monahan's board seat was on behalf of Monarch Properties which expressed an interest in Ewart earlier this year. The sale of almost 30 per cent in Ewart was made to Pattenhead Establishment at a premium of more than 22p to the market price. Pattenhead says its interests are friendly. Interim results from Allen reflect the difficulties endured by the contracting and construction sector. But directors were buying in September and recently the chairman and managing director bought shares.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                               No of Company                 Sector     Shares      Value      directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Allen                      C&amp;C     22,000         15              1 Amersham Intl             Hlth     36,000        217              1* BAA                       Tran      5,500         41              1 Central TV                 Med      1,200         18              1 Courtaulds                Text     85,000        463              2* Dalgety                   FdMa      4,000         19              1 Ewart                     Prop  5,495,145      4,375              1 Glaxo                     Hlth    300,000      2,433              1* Goodhead                   Med  1,000,000        400              1 Lowndes Lambert           Insb    175,000        539              7 Marks &amp; Spencer           Stor    116,786        392              2* Perpetual                 OthF      7,000         14              1 Plysu                     Chem     30,000         75              1 Powell Duffryn            Tran      7,000         30              1 Sainsbury J               FdRe      5,000         26              1 Smith &amp; Nephew            Hlth     10,000         16              1 Smiths Industries         EngA     56,689        190              1* TV-AM                      Med     22,500         15              3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Allen                      C&amp;C    138,800         95              2 British Fittings          BdMa     70,000         29              4 British Polythene         Pack      5,000         19              1 Casket                    BuSe     80,000         25              1 Fairway Group             Misc    120,000         46              2 Nesco Investments         Elns     91,987         20              1 Rhino Group               Misc    360,000        102              1 Singer &amp; Friedland        Merc    350,000        151              2 Sphere Inv Tr Inc         InTr    100,000         12              1 Staveley                  OthI     10,000         21              1 Ulster TV                  Med     10,000         27              1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

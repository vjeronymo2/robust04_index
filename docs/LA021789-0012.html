The inaugural season  for the orchestra, which is attempting to fill the void left by the bankruptcy  of the Oakland Symphony in 1986, lists five concerts through June 3, one of  them a pops program. The orchestra has raised $120,000 towards its initial  $360,000 budget, not counting a $100,000 matching grant from the City of  Oakland. The new ensemble has enlisted 52 of the 72 players from the defunct  orchestra.  </P></p>

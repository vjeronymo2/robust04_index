			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ghali Muhammad] </F>   [Text] Will Egypt export natural gas to Israel? This is the  week's question. But this question is not the real issue that is  presently being forcefully raised in numerous Egyptian circles.    If Qatar has preceded Egypt and has actually agreed to  export  gas to Israel--executive steps are being taken currently behind  the scenes in this regard--then this is a purely Qatari affair  and it has no connection whatsoever with the Egyptian issue. The  Egyptian issue centers initially on the question of whether  Egypt has any surplus natural gas to export abroad, and secondly  on the question of exporting to Israel just like any other  country.    The answer to this question will lead us to the answer to  the  week's question, which we will put aside until the end of this  report.    To begin, there is no disagreement that natural gas is a  main  component of energy now. Rather, all expectations are that in  the coming phase, natural gas will play the main role in meeting  the energy demand that is growing as a result of increased  development rates. Moreover, natural gas will, as petroleum  experts say, be the driving force in the energy field. This is  insofar as the international situation is concerned. As for  Egypt, energy concerns will focus on natural gas following the  discovery of more gas reserves and the increased use of gas to  replace liquid petroleum derivatives for numerous purposes, the  latest of which is the use of gas [as fuel] for buses. Moreover,  this increased use of gas will alleviate the pressure on oil  consumption. Oil finds and reserves are not increasing at the  same pace as natural gas finds and reserves.    Petroleum Minister Hamdi al-Banbi's asserts that Egypt's  natural gas reserves amounted to 21 trillion cubic feet on 1  January 1994, whereas confirmed reserves totaled 12 trillion  cubic feet last year.    The petroleum minister added that the total reserve from  which gas is pumped into the national gas network does not  exceed 8.6 trillion cubic feet. But with the tendency to replace  oil derivatives with gas, it is necessary to increase this  reserve in order to meet domestic demand and to allocate the  surplus for export.    It is not expected that discovered gas fields will be  developed and ready for use before the lapse of five years at  least. In this period, the foreign firms that have discovered  these fields are expected to spend $5 million to make these  fields ready to pump gas and to be connected with the national  gas pipeline network.    On a related issue, Petroleum Minister Hamdi al-Banbi has  said that these reserves have to be increased in order to meet  the increase in demand for natural gas, estimated at 5 percent  annually. It is expected that the consumption rate will exceed  one trillion cubic feet annually by the year 1997. This means  that it is necessary to secure gas supplies amounting to 1.3  trillion cubic feet annually.  <H5>  Growing Consumption </H5>   After discussing the anticipated reserves and recent  [estimates] of the potential use of natural gas, we shift to the  figures of the Petroleum Authority on the role of natural gas in  Egypt's energy system. Engineer Muhammad Tawilah, the Petroleum  Authority vice chairman for natural gas affairs, points out that  gas consumption in 1980-81 was roughly 1.9 million tons,  representing 14 percent of the total domestic consumption of oil  derivatives, which totaled 13.3 million tons.    In 1992-93, gas consumption amounted to 8.2 million tons,  representing 31 percent of the total domestic consumption of oil  derivatives, which totaled 26.6 million tons.    Since gas production started, Egypt has consumed a gas  volume  equaling 715 million barrels of crude oil, meaning that Egypt  has saved a volume of crude oil, valued at $13 billion. The cost  of development, of building the gas treatment facilities and the  transportation and distribution network, and of operating the  gas network amounted to $2.5 billion by the end of 1993.    Engineer Muhammad Tawilah has said that several sectors have  begun to use gas instead of oil. The electricity sector tops the  list of gas consumers with 64 percent [of the consumption],  followed by the nitrogenous fertilizer plants with 15 percent,  and the construction and ceramics sector with 5 percent, and,  finally, home use which does not exceed 1 percent.    Generally, the economic value of replacing liquid fuel with  gas in various sectors since gas use was begun, until June 1993  amounts to $11 billion.    This is for consumption. As for production, the figures  show,  according to the Petroleum Authority vice chairman, that gas  production rose from 85 billion cubic feet in 1980/81 to 377  billion cubic feet in 1992/93. The delta and Mediterranean  fields, Abu-Madi, Shamalah, and Abu-Qir fields contribute 53  percent of the total natural gas production. The Western Desert  fields of Badr-al-Din, Abu-Sinan, and Abu-al-Gharadiq contribute  34 percent and the Suez Gulf fields produce 13 percent.    A number of projects are being implementation and will enter  the production phase soon, such as the Trans-Gulf Gas Project,  the project to extract butane gas in al-'Amiriyah, and the  marine compressors project at Abu-Qir.    All these areas fall within the bounds of the confirmed  reserve, which amounted to 12 trillion cubic feet last year. But  with the discovered new finds, the reserves have risen to 21  trillion cubic feet. Thus, there are now new fields in several  areas that need to be developed.  <H5>  Self-Sufficiency! </H5>   In light of all these figures, the question that arises is:  has Egypt achieved self-sufficiency in gas?    Engineer Muhammad Tawilah has said, "To date, the domestic  market hasn't reached the point of gas saturation. It still  needs more. Assuming that the new reserves, estimated at 9  trillion cubic feet--a figure confirmed at the beginning of  January 1994--are not developed, there will be a shortfall  ranging from 620 [number as published] million to 300 million  cubic feet daily in the short run, until 1998/99. The shortfall  will then resurface after the year 2000 and will grow to reach  1.3 billion cubic feet daily by the year 2009/10.    "But in case the new reserves--estimated at 9 trillion cubic  feet, raising the confirmed reserve to 21 trillion cubic  feet--are developed, then a gas surplus will begin to appear in  Egypt, beginning at about 200 million cubic feet daily by  1998/99 and rising to 1.4 billion cubic feet daily by the year  2010. These reserves have been calculated on the basis of  achieving self-sufficiency and of meeting the needs of power  stations and of plants located close to the unified gas network.  As for delivering gas to Chema Aswan and to the other parts of  Upper Egypt, it isn't economical, because huge investments will  be needed to lay down gas pipelines. Who will shoulder these  costs?    "These surpluses have also been determined without taking  into account any expected new finds in this period. As for  self-sufficiency, the criterion is based on economically meeting  the needs of the consumers who are close to the network."  <H5>  To Europe and Israel </H5>   Within the bounds of this information, it is expected that  there will be a natural gas surplus of close to 200 million  cubic feet in the final year of this century, increasing to 1.4  billion cubic feet by the year 2010. Accordingly, the question  is: where will this natural gas surplus go?    If the answer is, of course, that it has to be exported to  the outside world, then to what region will it be exported?  Petroleum experts say that according to economic feasibility, to  market economy, and to supply and demand in particular, the  surplus will go to southern Europe, because this region will  absorb large quantities of gas in the first decade of the next  century. It is well known that most European countries,  excluding France, have suspended programs to produce electricity  from nuclear energy. In light of the environmental restraints  and controls have increased the cost of coal-operated power  plants, natural gas will be the natural alternative for  electricity production. Accordingly, expectations indicate that  demand for natural gas in the southern European countries will  rise to 6.3 trillion cubic feet [annually] by the year 2010,  whereas gas supply from the current sources, namely from the  commonwealth countries, Norway, the Netherlands, and Algeria  will amount to 4.2 trillion cubic feet [annually] in the same  year, i.e., 2010. This means that the shortfall will amount to  nearly two trillion cubic feet.    To export the gas surplus to the southern European  countries,  Israel has to be the station through which the pipeline transits.  <H5>  Three Reasons </H5>   A preparatory question is demanded for this answer before we  answer the question of the week, namely the question of whether  Egypt will export natural gas to Israel. This preparatory  question asks: why does the Egyptian pipeline have to go through  Israel? The answer is that there are several reasons that make  this selection beneficial to the Egyptian market:    First, the natural gas finds are not as big as those  discovered in the Arab Gulf states and Algeria. Therefore, the  pipeline has to pass through dry lands in order to reduce  construction cost. Consequently, the pipeline has to go to  Europe through either Israel or Turkey.    If the finds were very big, the pipeline could go across the  Mediterranean Sea, where the cost would be high because of deep  water. This alternative is not available to Egypt.    Second, extending a natural gas pipeline to Europe through  dry lands will enable the pipeline to pass through more than one  country. Consequently, natural gas can be sold to these  countries, namely Turkey, Israel, Jordan, and the state of  Palestine.    Third, in any case, Egypt will not be the only Arab country  that will be supplying gas to a gas pipeline going to Europe  through Israel. Some Arab Gulf countries will also supply such a  pipeline.    To build this pipeline from Qatar to Israel, the pipeline  has  to go through Saudi territory. Two days ago, Israel Radio  attributed to Israeli Energy Minister Moshe Shahal the statement  that a pipeline to deliver natural gas from Arab countries to  Israel--meaning the Israeli-Qatari accord--will be constructed  sooner than expected.    Regarding this last point, the idea of constructing a gas  pipeline from Qatar across Saudi Arabia to Egypt's Mediterranean  coast, from whence to export gas by tankers to Europe after  building liquefying plants--this idea was raised previously. But  it has not seen the light to date.  <H5>  Diverse Strategy </H5>   This is insofar as Egypt and Qatar are concerned. But what  about Israel? To put it more precisely, what is Israel's  strategy for acquiring natural gas?    According to available information, the Israeli strategy is  to acquire natural gas as a clean fuel to replace some liquid  oil derivatives that are polluting Israel's environment.  Israel's strategy is to obtain the natural gas it needs from  Egypt and the Arab Gulf states by way of Qatar, from which a  pipeline will be constructed, passing through Israel and Turkey  to Europe. Moreover, Israel is thinking of obtaining natural gas  from a third Arab country. This strategy can only become a  practical reality in the context of peace in the Middle East.    Within this context, Israel is eager to diversify its  natural  gas sources rather than rely on the monopoly of a single  country, especially since the indications are that there will be  increased use of natural gas to desalinate sea water in the  future.    To underline the idea that Israel will be a transit station  for the Egyptian and Qatari gas pipelines to Europe, [one should  note that] Israel's gas demand will amount to 1.4 billion cubic  feet daily by the year 2010. This volume is smaller than the  volume that will be pumped from Egypt and Qatar by then.  Therefore, the main export activity will be to the European  countries.    So, why does Israel want natural gas from Egypt? As already  noted, the pipeline has to be extended to Europe through dry  land. Moreover, if a pipeline is built from Port Said to Israel,  Egypt will not shoulder the cost, which will amount to $300  million. Here, we ask the Ministry of Petroleum why it does not  consider setting up a joint company between the Petroleum  Authority and foreign firms that produce gas in Egypt to finance  and operate this pipeline. This will be a better situation for  Egypt.    Expectations suggest that Israel's demand for Egyptian  natural gas will amount to 250 million cubic feet daily. This is  a small amount equaling the consumption of two power plants.    It is well known that this is not the first time Egypt has  dealt with Israel in the oil area. The fact is that Israel has  been purchasing Egyptian oil for 15 years at international  prices. Therefore, the Ministry of Petroleum sees no difference  between exporting crude oil or natural gas as long as Israel  observes Egyptian rules and regulations. Moreover, Egypt will  sell gas to Israel at the international price prevailing at the  time of export, without any exceptions. Furthermore, Egypt  cannot compel foreign partners not to export their share of the  natural gas to Israel. If this project is carried out, Egypt  will benefit from the installations and will export its natural  gas at a lower cost.    In a related development, Excelsior [name illegible], an  Israeli firm located in al-Ramlah, has held contacts with firms  in the region in preparation for implementing in Israel  complementary projects that will emanate from extending gas  pipelines from the Arab Gulf countries and Egypt.    Another aspect is that Egypt has set its sight on enabling  the newborn state of Palestine to benefit from its natural gas,  considering that Israel can secure gas from various sources,  whereas it will be difficult for any country to supply the state  of Palestine with gas.    Another side of the picture is summed up in this question:  why is Egypt considering natural gas export?    Oil experts assert that as soon as the Ministry of Petroleum  announces the export of gas to any country, the announcement  will attract international firms to prospect in areas where gas  is likely to exist in the delta, in the deep waters of the  Mediterranean Sea, and in the Western Desert. The reason why  firms will show interest is that they make their calculations on  the basis of market volume. If the market is confined to Egypt,  international firms will feel less secure. But if there are  other markets to absorb the gas, firms will come to work with a  feeling of total security. It is to be noted that Europe is  heading for increased gas use. Consequently, gas prices will  rise in the future.    The other point is that it is extremely important to export  natural gas in order to bolster Egyptian exports and the general  budget.    It is evident to date that the natural gas pipeline is  scheduled to extend from Egypt to Israel by 1998. But this  schedule is tied to several considerations:    First, completing the establishment of peace in the Middle  East.    Second, that Egypt will not conclude any accord with Israel  unless the Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum concludes agreements  with international firms to develop the current finds, requiring  nearly $5 billion. This is the answer to the week's question of  whether Egypt will export natural gas to Israel.</p>

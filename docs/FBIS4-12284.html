			<p>BFN     [Text] Aqaba (Petra)--Labour Minister Khalid al-Ghizawi  Friday [April 1] said the ministry is planning to replace  non-Jordanians working in the fields of medicine, engineering,  administration and clerical fields, accounting and driving with  Jordanian job seekers. In an interview with the Jordan News  Agency, Petra, Mr. al-Ghizawi said this step is aimed at  organising the local labour market, a measure which is essential  in the battle against unemployment, the minister added. The  ministry's decision was made after the completion of a study of  the labour market which aimed at identifying characteristics of  job-seekers. The minister said that the ministry is making  great efforts to encourage Jordanians to work in the agriculture  sector, where the presence of a non-Jordanian labour force is  prominent. He added that because of the low participation of  Jordanians in this sector, the ministry will continue to depend  on non-Jordanian labour.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The presidium of the Christian Democratic People's  Party [KDNP] has resigned. At a session of its national  executive, Party Chairman Laszlo Surjan described the party's  election performance as a fiasco, in spite of the fact that this  time it received more votes than four years ago. The departing  leader pointed out that the KDNP leadership must be renewed, and  that this is why the presidium has quit its mandate.</p>

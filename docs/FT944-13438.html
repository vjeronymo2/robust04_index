			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Tandem Computers recovery Tandem Computers reported record fourth-quarter revenues and earnings, signalling a turnround after last year's restructuring. Net income was Dollars 71m, or 62 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 604.4m. This compares with net income of Dollars 3.2m, or 3 cents, on revenues of Dollars 553.9m in the same period last year. The performance reflected a strong return to growth, said Mr James Treybig, president and chief executive. The company shipped a record number of computers during the year, he said, and orders grew by 20 per cent in the second half compared with the same period a year ago. 'These results validate our decisions last year to build and sell powerful computers at much lower prices with open software products,' said Mr Treybig. Like many computer companies, Tandem is making a transition from proprietary technology to lower-priced 'open systems' products. Shipments of mid-range computers grew 66 per cent, while sales of high-end computers almost tripled over last year, and sales of Unix servers were up 42 per cent. For the fiscal year, revenues were Dollars 2.1bn, up from Dollars 2.0bn. Net income was Dollars 170.2, or Dollars 1.50 a share, including a one-time gain of 20 cents a share from the sale of Applied Communications, a subsidiary. This compares with a loss of Dollars 517.7m, or Dollars 4.61, for fiscal 1993, which included a Dollars 451m restructuring charge.</p>

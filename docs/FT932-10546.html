			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / SFO seeks 'big fish' behind Asil Nadir escape DETECTIVES from the Serious Fraud Office are looking for an individual who they believe masterminded the escape of Mr Asil Nadir, in an investigation which could lead them to take action against others involved. The revelations came as Mr Nadir yesterday emerged from his hideaway in Kyrenia, northern Cyprus, saying he jumped bail and fled to the island because he feared he would not have a fair trial in Britain. At the same time the Foreign Office maintained its pressure on Turkey to seek the return of Mr Nadir. Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, a foreign office minister, met the Turkish ambassador, Mr Candemir Onhon, and delivered a 'strong message' asking for help in retrieving Mr Nadir. Mr Onhon promised to convey the request, but he refused to promise any help with extradition. This followed the unusual step taken on Thursday by Lord Mackay, lord chancellor, of visiting northern Cyprus, which is unrecognised by Britain, to put the UK case to Mr Rauf Denktash, president of the self-proclaimed republic. Lord Mackay was in Cyprus for a conference. In its search to find how Mr Nadir left the UK, the SFO was yesterday pursuing 'some promising lines of inquiry'. A source close to the investigation said: 'We want the organiser. This will show us who are the minions. We want the big fish behind it all.' British Aerospace said it had provided the SFO with information on the flight plan of the chartered aircraft used by Mr Nadir on the second leg of his journey, from France to northern Cyprus on Tuesday evening. It confirmed the aircraft flew on Monday from Hatfield, an airport owned by the company. British police have been working with French police through Interpol in the attempt to unravel the full story of the escape. A senior SFO source said police expected people found to have knowingly helped Mr Nadir jump bail to face criminal prosecution even it required extradition from France. Yesterday in Kyrenia, Mr Nadir was cheered as he drove up to the Jasmine Court Hotel in a black Mercedes. Flanked by bodyguards, he delivered a tirade against the British justice system in a 20-minute statement. He said: 'I do assure you it wasn't an easy decision to leave Great Britain, knowing as I do the consequences of jumping bail but the chances of me receiving a fair trial were receding by the day . . . I had to have freedom to move, to think, to talk. They had killed that, and so I came here so that I could at long last obtain for myself the basic human right to defend myself.' Mr Nadir entered the hotel in an atmosphere reminiscent of a local wedding. A sheep was to have been ceremonially slaughtered, but it was spared after a British reporter argued that the killing would give tabloid newspapers a field day. Looking nervous and tired, Mr Nadir attacked the SFO and the Foreign Office. He said it was 'evident' that the British authorities had fed incorrect material to the media.

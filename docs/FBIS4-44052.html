			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "C.G.": "Bonn Does Not Want To Burden the EU </F> Presidency With Unresolved Personnel Issues"]    [Excerpts] Bonn, 22 Jun -- When it assumes the EU  presidency on 1 July, Germany wants to make it clear that the  "main orientation" of the reunited country's foreign policy will  be directed toward European cooperation. That is what emerges  from the goals and main points of the EU presidency that were  approved by the cabinet in Bonn on Wednesday [22 June].  Speaking at the meeting, Chancellor Kohl said that he wanted  the Germans to exercise "a normal and good presidency" over the  next six months, one that should not seek superficial  achievements, but continuity in cooperation with partners,  especially with France and Spain. Foreign Minister Kinkel said  that Germany will show that it is committed to close and  enduring cooperation in "solidly implementing the Maastricht  Treaty" and make a particular effort to provide the European  Parliament with additional powers.    Discussing the Strasbourg EU Parliament, Kinkel drew  attention to difficulties connected with personnel decisions.  The European Parliament must vote on the composition of the  future EU Commission in Brussels. According to Bonn, the most  important question that the European Council has to answer in  Corfu on Friday is who will succeed Delors. There is  substantial annoyance in Bonn that Dutch Prime Minister Ruud  Lubbers is conducting "an election campaign with all possible  means" to become president of the EU Commission, despite his  defeat in the parliamentary elections. There is particular  irritation in Bonn about personal attacks on Kohl. It is being  said that in the case of a secret ballot in Corfu on Friday  evening, Belgian Prime Minister [Jean-Luc] Dehaene can count on  a majority of 10 votes to two among the EU member states. If  Holland does not block a decision in favor of Dehaene and Great  Britain receives compensation in the form of another post, the  European Council will propose a new president at the Corfu  meeting. Great Britain is currently still promoting its  candidate [Trade Commissioner Sir Leon] Brittan and has raised  objections to Dehaene, saying that the Belgian is a  "federalist." In Bonn, it is being said that Great Britain is  considering convoking a special meeting of the European Council  at the end of July or the beginning of September, because of a  lack of consensus. The German EU presidency would then have to  "conjure up" another candidate: The three current contenders --  Dehaene, Lubbers, and Brittan -- would have to drop out in such  a case. That would be inconvenient for the German Government.  Bonn sees that as making the presidency more difficult.  [passage omitted]    A European Council action program for combating unemployment  is to be launched during the German presidency, which begins  after the meeting on Corfu, and the Federal Government wants to  press for adherence to free market principles during its  implementation. Kinkel and Economics Minister Rexrodt said that  the currency union should not be postponed, but should only come  into effect once the convergence criteria have been satisfied.  Rexrodt announced that the German presidency would institute a  technical procedure in Brussels for monitoring the budgetary  situation in individual member states. Industrial policy should  not be allowed to amount to no more than employment programs,  but should also bolster private investment. Bonn will appoint a  commission composed of representatives of business, science,  public administration, and trade unions in the member countries.  The commission should establish which central regulations can  be done away with. The European Union should conduct a critical  assessment of restrictions on trade with East Europe. Various  Brussels subsidy programs should be examined "so that there  should not be a flood of such programs, for which Germany pays  every third German mark." Kinkel summed up Germany's intentions  for the next six months as follows: "The German presidency will  not make any promises that it cannot keep."</p>

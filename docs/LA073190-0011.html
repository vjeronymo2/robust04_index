			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POWAY SCHOOLS OK NEW READING SERIES FOR 6TH-GRADERS  </P> <P> Poway sixth-graders will learn reading and grammar this fall from textbooks  that emphasize literature rather than rote exercises.  </P> <P> The Poway Unified school board voted Monday night to adopt sixth-grade  literature textbooks in line with those used by seventh- and eighth-grade  students for the past year.  </P> <P> "The textbook we used prior to this one focused on specific decoding skills,  grammar skills and special comprehension skills," said Leslie Fausset,  assistant superintendent for learning support services. "The new texts give  students a whole piece of literature with which to work, and we've found that  all students benefit from critically analyzing and studying a text."  </P> <P> The old textbooks have been in use in the district for the past 10 years. Two  years ago the district piloted the new texts, which are published by  Prentice-Hall, Fausset said.  </P> <P> Seventh- and eighth-graders had been using similar literature-based texts since  last year, but sixth-grade books were not available until recently, Fausset  said.  </P> <P> Fausset said the new texts also incorporate examples of fine arts corresponding  to the piece of literature the student is reading.  </P> <P> "Prentice-Hall has done a magnificent job of introducing some fine arts  components, giving background information on paintings shown and the artists  who painted them. It really helps give the student the full picture," Fausset  said.  </P> <P> David Hughes, assistant superintendent, said the change in textbooks was in  step with changes in the state as a whole.  </P> <P> "The approach in the state of California has been moved to an integrated arts  program dealing with reading, writing and literature as a unit," Hughes said.  </P> <P> Fausset said San Diego city schools are in their first year of adopting a  similar textbook, but to her knowledge no other district in the county has done  so.  </P> <P> "Working with a piece of literature, working in conjunction with the literature  enables us to integrate not only writing skills but also critical thinking  skills," Fausset said.  </P></p>

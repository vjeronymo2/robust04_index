At the end of the meeting between the traditional chiefs,  the  Sultan of the Air, El Hadj Ibrahim Oumarou, in a statement  broadcast on national television, called on Tuareg people to  show "civic-mindedness and patriotism " in order for them to  give a "precious contribution" to the settlement of the Tuareg  conflict.    He also regretted the current economic situation that is  "particularly preoccupying" in northern Niger and asked "all  countries who are friends of Niger such as France, Algeria,  Nigeria, and Burkina Faso" to give "full support" to a  definitive return of peace in the north of country.    At the beginning of the month, the four movements of the  rebellion, grouped within the Coordination of the Armed  Resistence, agreed to resume dialogue with the Niger government  and announced the holding of a meeting in Ouagadougou (Burkina  Faso), with no date fixed as yet.    On 5 February, a French diplomat, Mr. Jean-Francois Nodinot,  was appointed "mediator" in the conflict, which has left 91  people dead since November 1991.</p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BRAWN VS. SPEED;  </P> <P> NO. 2 MICHIGAN HAS A HUGE LINE, BUT IT MAY NOT SLOW DOWN NO. 1 NOTRE DAME  </P> <P> Michigan's offensive line, anchored by 330-pound tackle Greg Skrepenak, will  have the heaviest hitters in Wolverines history when the team, ranked second in  the AP college football poll, meets No. 1 Notre Dame on Saturday.  </P> <P> Actually, nobody is quite certain what Skrepenak weighs. The team has to take  him across from Michigan Stadium to Godfrey Moving and Storage to find scales  that will hold him.  </P> <P> The depth chart provided by the Michigan sports information department lists  Skrepenak at 320, but offensive line Coach Jerry Hanlon scoffed at that.  </P> <P> "They keep weighing him, but I don't even ask anymore," Hanlon said. "We'd like  him to get down to 320, but I don't think he's there yet."  </P> <P> Even assuming Skrepenak does weigh 320, the Wolverines' offensive line is the  heaviest in school history, averaging 293 pounds per player.  </P> <P> The front five consists of Tom Dohring, 290; Dean Dingman, 292; Steve Everett,  270; Joe Cocozzo, 294, and Skrepenak. That is almost enough to blot out the  sun.  </P> <P> Consider that when Reggie McKenzie and Dan Dierdorf played on what is  considered one of the Wolverines' great lines in the early 1970s, that line  averaged 225 pounds.  </P> <P> Notre Dame's offensive line of Mike Brennan, Tim Ryan, Mike Heldt, Tim Grunhard  and Dean Brown averages only 253 pounds.  </P> <P> "I wonder whether we're strong enough," Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz said. "We're  giving away 50 pounds a man."  </P> <P> But winning the war in the trenches will not guarantee Michigan a victory. The  Wolverines also dominated the offensive front last year, but Notre Dame's Ricky  Watters scored on an 81-yard punt return and Reggie Ho kicked four field goals  as the Irish won 19-17.  </P> <P> "I don't know what we have here," Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler said earlier  this week. "We know we have some players at some positions that are very good.  We have some at other positions that aren't experienced enough. That could be a  problem to us."  </P> <P> He also fears his behemoths might be too slow for Notre Dame, which has great  quickness, especially in skill positions.  </P> <P> "At the skill positions, offensively, we probably match up pretty well,"  Schembechler said. "But we don't have that great speed that they have at  quarterback. There isn't any way we're going to be able to match that from a  running standpoint."  </P> <P> Notre Dame quarterback Tony Rice set a school record by rushing for 700 yards  while leading the Irish to the national championship last season.  </P> <P> "I think this is a much better Notre Dame offensive team than we faced in the  first game a year ago," Schembechler said. "It's a veteran offense. It has the  speed."  </P></p>

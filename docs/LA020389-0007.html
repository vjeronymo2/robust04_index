			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARYLOUISE OATES: THE PARTY IS OVER ... FOR A WHILE  </P> <P> (Marylouise Oates is taking a six-month leave of absence.)  </P> <P> My au revoir was planned as hip and flip;  </P> <P> I'm off to write my novel (at long last).  </P> <P> Black-ties and veal critiques won't be my trip;  </P> <P> My book's on '60s pols -- good times long past.  </P> <P> My scrapbook and my trusty Rolodex  </P> <P> Can catalogue the eight years that I've spent  </P> <P> On premieres, benefits, the social treks  </P> <P> To parties that were bombs -- or heaven-sent.  </P> <P> But what I've seen (and hope sometimes you've read)  </P> <P> Is that beneath the mink and diamond glitz  </P> <P> Folks here care and some of them have led  </P> <P> The rest of us to work, to do our bits.  </P> <P> </P> <P> My first salute is to groups fighting AIDS;  </P> <P> You've now become too numerous to name.  </P> <P> But let me quick, before the memory fades,  </P> <P> Cite Peter Scott who first stood without shame  </P> <P> To raise cash and hope for those hit so hard.  </P> <P> Kudos La Liz, Joel Weisman, Barry Krost,  </P> <P> Mathilde Krim -- your work is still so marred  </P> <P> By deaths -- so many gone, so many lost.  </P> <P> </P> <P> In this big city, some kids stand alone  </P> <P> 'Til helped by women who put style aside.  </P> <P> Bravo Colleagues -- you've added perfect tone  </P> <P> To help those kids. And right beside you stride  </P> <P> United Friends of the Children.  </P> <P> To you all -- To Nancy Daly, Stacey Winkler: Cheers  </P> <P> For your constant presence at MacLaren Hall.  </P> <P> And when singling out the special volunteers  </P> <P> Begin with Music Center folks. They've heard the call.  </P> <P> But with museums, groups and causes  </P> <P> It's not the structure that makes L.A. care,  </P> <P> But each person who joins in, who pauses  </P> <P> In his own life to help others fare.  </P> <P> </P> <P> In my six months away, there are things I just won't miss,  </P> <P> But to certain great people, let me send you a kiss.  </P> <P> Cheers to the Byrens, the Kleins and the Plitts.  </P> <P> To the O'Malleys and Dodgers, a season of hits.  </P> <P> To Rodeo Drive and its very special Fred Hayman  </P> <P> To other friends of the homeless, a rousing amen.  </P> <P> Memories crowd up. The Wrathers, Jack and dear Bunny,  </P> <P> Cary Grant, who could be both sexy and funny.  </P> <P> The singing debut of the Betty Clooney Foundation;  </P> <P> Spago -- the night of my engagement reservation.  </P> <P> Seeing the city curtsy to Fergie and Andrew  </P> <P> Like it's done to the Wassermans, Edie and Lew.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Big givers shine on both sides of the aisle,  </P> <P> Like Mrs. Margaret Brock -- politics with a smile.  </P> <P> And recent arrivals like Ted Field and Susie;  </P> <P> Every party at Green Acres sure has been newsy.  </P> <P> Give a hand to old hands in the charity game --  </P> <P> Without SHARE and its Boomtown nothing's the same.  </P> <P> While "Show Co" puts stars on the politics trail,  </P> <P> Judy Levy, Charlotte Conway sell out without fail.  </P> <P> Sarah Pillsbury and her Richard Kletter  </P> <P> Join Marilyn, Alan Bergman -- none better.  </P> <P> While the left side woos the "Sandalnistas"  </P> <P> The Reagans hold court here -- at least as  </P> <P> Long as people want to climb  </P> <P> Up where the White House air's sublime.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cheers to Trumps, Bistro Garden and the Bistro;  </P> <P> Toasts Esther Wachtell and Carmine Marinello;  </P> <P> To Barbara and Marvin Davis parties galore;  </P> <P> To Aaron and Candy, a house with one floor.  </P> <P> To downtown types, like Arco's Cooks, Lod and Carole;  </P> <P> To Councilmen John Ferraro, Bobby Farrell.  </P> <P> To Deputy Mayor Mike and Lacey Gage;  </P> <P> To Ed Sanders for making Dukakis the rage;  </P> <P> To great couples -- Hirsh, Stanley and Anita;  </P> <P> Cheers Marco, Joan Weiss -- there's just no one neater.  </P> <P> The Special Olympics and Mr. Johnson, that's Rafer;  </P> <P> To DARE and the LAPD -- we all feel much safer.  </P> <P> To City Atty. Jimmy and his Monica Hahn;  </P> <P> To David Jones, Milo Bixby and the million-dollar lawn;  </P> <P> To the best in hoteliers -- Helen Chaplin, Jacques Camus.  </P> <P> To Jane and Marc Nathanson -- may you never feel blue.  </P> <P> To the Mikes -- Eisner, Ovitz and Medavoy;  </P> <P> To Ruth Reichl's new baby, Nick, what a joy.  </P> <P> To the wondrous members of the Consular Corps;  </P> <P> To Cedars' great women's guild -- decades more.  </P> <P> </P> <P> To Lucy's El Adobe in its 25th year,  </P> <P> Now that Jerry's back, you'll find him eating here.  </P> <P> To Mickey Kantor, to Kathinka and John Tunney;  </P> <P> To Comic Relief -- which made fund-raising funny;  </P> <P> For the Legal Aid Foundation -- protectors of law;  </P> <P> For the Normans -- Lee, Lear and of course Brokaw.  </P> <P> I'll miss Army Archerd -- my eyes grow misty;  </P> <P> Such fun to party -- and of course, George Christy.  </P> <P> To Joan and Bill Luther, to Linda Hunt --  </P> <P> Good public relations -- keep up L.A.'s front.  </P> <P> To Chuck Fuentes, to Ramona Ripston,  </P> <P> To Bob Burkett -- a real political piston;  </P> <P> To photogs, Lee Salem and Alan Berliner;  </P> <P> To John Madden, who is considerably thinner.  </P> <P> To all of the Reagans' special First Friends,  </P> <P> OK. Enough. This is where my space ends.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some night soon -- Thursday -- just about 7,  </P> <P> When the posh suit up to go hear Andre Previn,  </P> <P> My black tie and glitz will remain unworn.  </P> <P> And if I feel a little forlorn  </P> <P> I'll just ask Bob and Mike to go out for Chinese.  </P> <P> To them and to you, hugs and a squeeze.  </P></p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: Dunton cuts losses and makes Pounds 760,000 rights Dunton Group, with interests in brickmaking, engineering and property, cut its pre-tax losses from Pounds 852,000 to Pounds 636,000 for the half year ended November 30 1993. The USM-traded group is also calling for Pounds 760,000 net via a 1-for-3 underwritten rights issue at 6p a share to help reduce debt. The balance of debt will be tackled via a restructuring arrangement with the group's bankers. Dunton said restructuring would leave it with totally ungeared properties and positive cash balances. At the same time Mr Clive Travers has resigned as chairman and sold the majority of his shareholding to the directors and others. Mr David Williams, executive chairman of Mosiac Investments and non-executive director of Waste Recycling, has been appointed a director and non-executive chairman of Dunton.

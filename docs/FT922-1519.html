			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Maxwell auditors criticise Imro COOPERS &amp; Lybrand, accountants of the Maxwell empire, said yesterday it would take legal advice over criticism in a confidential report on the regulatory supervision of the Maxwell companies. The accountancy firm said it was outraged at criticism levelled in the unpublished report by Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry. Leaks from the report and briefings about its contents have led to hostility between the auditors and regulators amid indications from the government that it is reluctant to involve itself in the report's publication. Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, has called on the government to examine ways of publishing the report, which has been submitted to the Securities and Investments Board. Mr Field, who was chairman of the all-party Commons social security committee in the last parliament, is one of the MPs leading the campaign on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners. Publication has been delayed because of fears that the report might be libellous, but Mr Field said that if the report was released as a Commons paper, anyone who wished to use it in a legal action would have to seek permission from the House. The government would prefer publication of the report to be handled by SIB, which is taking legal advice about plans to publish an edited version by mid July, before the Commons disperses. The Financial Times reported on June 10 that Imro had produced the report, which is understood to be largely self-critical. Imro admits in the report that it failed to set up proper risk assessment procedures. Extracts in yesterday's Sunday Times, which said it had been shown a copy, demonstrate that Imro appears also to be directing some blame for failures in the regulation of Maxwell companies at Coopers. Coopers audited for Bishopsgate Investment Management (BIM) and London &amp; Bishopsgate International (LBI), the Maxwell-owned companies at the centre of the scandal over the disappearance of Pounds 427m from Maxwell pension funds. Coopers said it was outraged by a suggestion that it had delayed release of its own report to Imro, prepared after Mr Robert Maxwell's death last November. Imro said Coopers had seemed 'most reluctant' to provide the report, but Coopers said a draft was sent on December 4, having been completed on the previous evening. Imro's report said it had relied on the auditors to take corrective action after Coopers had identified a series of shortcomings in the accounts of LBI and BIM during its audit work in 1990. It also claimed that Coopers did not use an 'established gateway' to IMRO to voice any important concerns. Coopers said yesterday that the shortcomings had been procedural items and pointed out that it had a statutory obligation to inform Imro only about LBI and not BIM. That gap in reporting requirements, Coopers said, was a legislative failing that needed to be addressed by the government.</p>

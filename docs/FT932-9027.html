			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Delors in talks with Kohl ahead of Danish referendum MR JACQUES Delors, president of the European Commission, has paid a discreet visit to Bonn for talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, just five days before the Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty on Tuesday. EC officials described the talks, held on Thursday, as a routine diplomatic exchange to prepare for the EC summit in Copenhagen next month, but the low-profile trip suggests both sides are keen to co-ordinate their positions in the event of a Danish No vote. Opinion polls in Denmark yesterday showed the Yes vote strengthening its lead slightly, although surveys failed to predict the narrow result against the treaty in last June's referendum which triggered a wave of devaluations in the European exchange rate mechanism. A poll by Gallup Spain also indicated that the pro-Maastricht campaign might be persuading more people to vote. The poll showed 50 per cent of those surveyed voting Yes, 32 per cent No, 13 per cent are undecided and 5 per cent unwilling to vote. Senior EC officials this week expressed confidence that the Danes would approve Maastricht and said there was no Brussels blueprint for dealing with a No vote. 'There would be lots of recrimination, a wailing and gnashing of teeth,' said one EC commissioner, 'but after the dust settled people would look carefully at what they could do.' Key EC personnel, including senior legal staff, have however been told to be on stand-by to fly to Rome to attend the previously scheduled meeting of EC foreign ministers on Wednesday. The following day, Chancellor Kohl is due to meet Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain in either Aachen or Bonn. Mr Delors, who was travelling in Italy yesterday, was due to return to Brussels this weekend. He has remained aloof from the Danish referendum campaign, acknowledging that attempts to swing the vote in favour of a Yes would almost certainly backfire. Mr Delors' talks with Chancellor Kohl are believed to have covered the European economy and the poor outlook for growth. The Commission president wants to make the EC 'growth package' as well as a broad discussion about Europe's unemployment crisis a centrepiece of the Copenhagen summit.

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Senior bourses suffer after revised US data Revised gdp data, and consumer sentiment indications from the US had little impact on their domestic market, but were followed by substantial foreign selling in senior European bourses, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS dropped 2 per cent after substantial selling orders from the US, said Mr John Fordyce at Ferri International. The CAC-40 index fell 41.22 to 2,050.67, down 4.9 per cent on the week, in turnover of FFr4.4bn. The story of the day, however, was strictly European: Schneider, the electrical engineering group, dropped FFr23.30, or 5.6 per cent to FFr390 after its chairman, Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, was jailed by in Brussels following a complaint by minority shareholders in two of the group's Belgian subsidiaries. Mr Pineau-Valencienne is scheduled to appear before a judge on Wednesday. Meanwhile, for the whole market, Mr Fordyce feared the absence of UK and US participation on Monday, after a fall of 300 points in the CAC-40 since early in Febuary. 'We could see small shareholders coming in as a flotilla of sellers, with no prop from abroad,' he said. FRANKFURT was hit by heavy selling of Dax futures and foreign selling of the cash market from a little after midday, said Mr Edgar Benischek, head of trading at Bank Julius Bar. It closed the official session with the Dax index 10.74 higher at 2,140.99, down from a day's high of 2,158.26; it then slid further in the afternoon to an Ibis-indicated close of 2,112.80. Turnover eased from DM8.5bn to DM7.3bn. Big stocks like Deutsche Bank, Daimler and Volkswagen took the brunt of the selling as proxies for the market, said Mr Benischek. Looking at the 6.1 per cent fall on the week, he thought that the German bourse could be in a correction phase similar to that experienced earlier this year by the Swiss bourse - when, from peak to trough, blue chips fell by 19.5 per cent. MILAN remained under pressure until a late technical rebound pulled shares off their worst levels as the Comit index tested support around the 720 level. The index finished 10.26 lower at 730.69, for a 5.9 per cent fall over the week. A heavy flow of capital increases announced this week contributed to the unsettled mood of a market facing profit-taking, particularly by foreign investors, in the wake of the post-election euphoria. Trading volume, however, was thin. Ifil, the Agnelli family holding company, was the day's big loser, down L1,083 or 14.3 per cent to L6,511, in response to its announcement of plans to raise L800bn in fresh funds. Analysts commented that investors were unhappy that half the cash would be used to finance the switch of the Unicem cement group to Ifil from its sister IFI holding company. BCI gave up L74 to L5,031, adding to Thursday's sharp fall in the wake of news that it planned to raise L2,000bn. Fiat lost L66 to L6,635 in spite of hopes that the new government might be about to announce measures to jump-start the economy, including incentives for new car buyers. Mediobanca lost another L399 to L15,225 amid expectations that official notice of an inquiry into the merchant bank's role as adviser on the restructuring of Ferruzzi-Montedison was expected to be sent to bank directors within the next few days. ZURICH was heartened by data indicating that the economy was gaining momentum, while inflation remained low and the SMI index rose 22.7 to 2,711.9, for a 0.8 per cent fall on the week. Better than expected May inflation figures yesterday followed Thursday's announcement of 1.3 per cent growth in the first quarter of the year. Financials were firm: UBS bearers rose SFr10 to SFr1,170, CS Holding put on SFr6 to SFr612 and Zurich Insurance was SFr16 higher at SFr1,336. Nestle continued its come-back, adding SFr22 to SFr1,145 while Roche certificates were SFr65 better at SFr6,610 ahead of Tuesday's annual meeting. AMSTERDAM was under pressure from domestic bonds and the weak showing of London equities, and the AEX slid 3.11 to 401.63, close to the psychologically important 400 level. The market had fallen 2.7 per cent over the week. Chemical stocks continued to recover after the weakness of the last two weeks. DSM picked up Fl 1 to Fl 135 while Akzo was 90 cents higher at Fl 210.70. Nedlloyd gave up another Fl 1.40 to Fl 71.10 in response to this week's lower than expected first quarter results. ATHENS recovered another 2.3 per cent, the general index rising 19.12 to 855.43, but it was still 6.3 per cent lower on a week which saw a continuing liquidity crisis driving investors to high-yielding investments in risk-free, bank-to-customer repurchase agreements (repos). ISTANBUL, in contrast, fell by 3.65 per cent as investors fled into treasury bills, the composite index ending 599.72 down at 15,825.12.

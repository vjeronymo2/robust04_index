			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Mexico's Financial Crisis: Equity and debt markets suffer The devaluation of the Mexican peso yesterday triggered further sales in the local debt and equity markets, with prices of Mexican Brady bonds falling to their lowest levels for more than three years. And with investors' confidence in emerging markets damaged, the sell-off extended to affect other Latin American and even east European assets. Mr Alexis Rodzianko, managing director of emerging markets at Chemical Bank in New York and chairman of the Emerging Markets Traders Association (EMTA), said the action was a 'big blow', following earlier losses this year for the Brady bond market, made up of bonds issued in exchange for distressed commercial debt. Trading volume more than doubled in 1993 and has increased by at least 50 per cent this year, according to EMTA. But Mr Rodzianko said growth was now likely to slow. Mexico was regarded as a benchmark by emerging market investors, he said. 'Mexico is the flagship. It has just hoisted the white flag and turned tail,' he said. 'This is a serious football injury. The patient is in traction.' Mexican Bradies were sold heavily on Tuesday and Wednesday, but the government's decision to float the peso on Wednesday evening prompted frantic sales efforts from managers. 'Clients were out of their beds at 3.30am New York time and were selling pretty much everything. We have been deluged with calls,' said one trader in London. 'For us it was one of the five busiest days of the year. Prices are moving not by eighths and quarters but by halfs and whole points,' he said. The widely traded Mexican par bonds fell by 2 3/8 cents in early trading in London to 55 1/4 . Although they recovered later in the day the cumulative fall since the end of last week amounts to more than 10 per cent. The prices of Argentine, Brazilian, Venezuelan, Polish and Russian bonds have also fallen in the past few days. The price of one popular variety of Argentine Bradies fell to 63 in late trading in New York, compared to 71.5 at the end of last week, for example. US institutions which have become big investors in emerging markets - and especially in Mexico - are estimated to have lost up to 20 per cent of their holdings in the country this week. Whereas sales of Bradies earlier this year - following the increase in short-term US interest rates in February - were led by US traders, analysts said institutions have been responsible for the decline this time. Mr Rodzianko said there was evidence that mutual funds were making sales to meet redemptions from investors. Ms Ingrid Iversen, senior economist with Morgan Grenfell Emerging Markets in London, said the fall in prices had been exacerbated because some highly leveraged investors had to unwind positions in order to meet margin calls. Mr Dwight Churchill, head of taxable fixed-income funds at Fidelity Investments, the largest US mutual fund group, said: 'The market is relatively thin, but it is trading.' Although there were no signs of outright panic among investors, he said there had been selling across the board. Mr Churchill said Fidelity was reassessing its investment strategy in the wake of the peso's devaluation. 'We are clearly re-evaluating the Mexican situation, and we are disappointed that a stable peso is not a centre-post of policy at this point. We will give the Mexican government the opportunity to provide an explanation of its current strategy, and will use that as a foundation to decide whether or not to change our strategy.' Mexican and Latin American equity markets were also affected. In Mexico the market opened firmer, then lost initial gains as foreign investors began to liquidate positions. By mid-morning the IPC index, which had risen more than 4 per cent at the opening, was down 22.37 or 1 per cent, at 2,181.30. But it subsequently recovered to close 4.66 per cent higher. Elsewhere in the region the picture was more negative. Brazil's Bovespa index ended down nearly 6.1 per cent, recovering from 11 per cent, while the Merval index in Argentina finished 3.0 per cent lower, also well above the day's worst. Ms Susanne Carrington, Latin American fund manager at Fleming Investment Management in London, which has some Dollars 1bn in the region, said that the present crisis had mainly come about as the result of political inexperience and had delivered a serious blow to the new administration's credibility. 'Many foreign investors had come round to the view of Mexico's economic miracle, and that the country was politically stable,' she said. 'But at a stroke that perception has been destroyed, and once more Mexico is seen as a typical emerging market.' Some investors are also concerned about Mexico's reduced ability to service its foreign currency debt - although analysts at JP Morgan in New York argued that internal and external debt was low at 22 per cent of GDP at the end of 1993. In the bond market traders say that with prices at current levels Brady bonds represent good value but that psychological factors were influencing sentiment. 'The market will hurt for a while,' Mr Rodzianko predicted.</p>

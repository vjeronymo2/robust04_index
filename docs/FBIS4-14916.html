			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Khodiy] </F>   [Text] Irkutsk, 5 Apr -- All 45 deputies to the Irkutsk  Oblast legislative assembly have been deemed elected following  the 27 March elections. This was made possible only after the  Russian Central Electoral Commission provided an explanation of  the elections, according to which the ballot is deemed valid if  no fewer than 25 percent of voters turn out.    Irkutsk used to have an electoral statute, according to  which  the figure -- set by the Siberians themselves -- was 35 percent.  If that had been the case, the 27 March elections would have  had to be declared invalid in several constituencies.</p>

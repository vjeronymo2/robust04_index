			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Arts: La Fille mal gardee - Ballet For two centuries, La Fille mal gardee has been one of the happiest and best loved of balletic comedies. It was born in Bordeaux on July 1, 1789, on the eve of the French Revolution. Its choreographer, Dauberval, was a man of rare dramatic abilities who produced ballets in which, he said, 'I do not just want to please the eyes. I must interest the heart'. His enchanting pastoral narrative - worthy of Moliere - proved irresistible, and has interested hearts ever since. Fille was re-staged throughout Europe in the 19th century, revised, altered in step and score, given in theatres grand and modest, and then, for British audiences, gained its ultimate and most adorable form in Ashton's 1960 masterpiece for the Royal Ballet. But what of Dauberval's original? We can hazard guesses at late-18th century technique and staging, but nothing remains (save a fragment of choreography by Galeotti in Copenhagen) of the dance or the dance manner that would be finally swept away by the wave of Romanticism. Scholarly reconstruction seeks to turn guesses into some sort of theatrical reality, and if we view such archeology with the eye of faith and a generous spirit, then the result can be something like. Neither true nor completely (we hope) untrue, the restoration opens a window on to the past. Just so the version of Fille that the Ballet du Rhin has brought to London on the occasion of its first visit. The company, based in Mulhouse, is directed by Jean-Paul Gravier who, when heading the Ballet de Nantes, invited Ivo Cramer to make a reconstruction of Dauberval's original Fille. Cramer is a distinguished Swedish choreographer and scholar, expert in pre-Romantic dance style. The presence of a Dauberval manuscript in Stockholm (where Fille was first seen in 1812) with details of the staging, and Ivor Guest's happy discovery of the original Bordeaux score, provided valuable references for Cramer's production. The result was charming, persuasive, and when Gravier moved to the Ballet du Rhin two years ago, he brought with him this touching piece of balletic history. And how like - and how unlike - it is to the Fille we know with the Royal ballet] The action is exactly similar, with the addition of a final harvest-field divertissement, and there are even fragments of the score which correspond with the Herold version we know today. Cramer's score has been expertly edited and orchestrated by Charles Farncombe, and probably given a good deal more musical dignity than it first knew. How much is owed to Ivor Guest's discovery we are not told - the programme book could, with advantage, have been more informative - but what we hear is pretty, often elegant, and Herold's borrowings for his version give us a touching link with the ballet's beginnings. What we see is a dance drama performed with a nice simplicity of manner, in a dance style that stresses quick, light footwork, decorous positions (though a couple of Cramer's lifts seem to me anachronistic), and a freshness and vivacity of manner that wins the heart. Incidents are short-breathed, but choreographic patterns - owing something to social dance forms - are felicitous. The Ballet du Rhin artists are charmers all, with Sandrine Moreau very pretty as Lison - she looks exactly like one of Friedric Schall's portraits of dancers of this period, found in the Ephrussi-de Rothschild Museum at Cap Ferrat - James Amar an elegant Colas, and Jean-Paul Gravier an energetic Ragotte, which is Mother Simone's new name. The ballet has been enchantingly dressed by the film-maker Dominique Delouche, and given suitably straight-forward decoration by him, complete with chandeliers on stage to remind us of the correct stage lighting. The score sounded beguiling, with the Wren orchestra under Stephen Lade. The evening is gentle, and a delight. The Ballet du Rhin presents La Fille mal gardee at Sadler's Wells on June 4, 5, 6, 12, 13; a triple bill of modern work can be seen on June 9,10. The visit is sponsored by the Association Francaise d'Action Artistique and the Opera du Rhin.</p>

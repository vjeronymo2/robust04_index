			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Sale move over atomic agency THE Atomic Energy Authority took a step closer to privatisation yesterday as the government announced that it was commissioning a report on the practicability of moving the nuclear and industrial research agency into the private sector. This fresh evidence of the government's determination to press ahead with privatisation was welcomed by the authority, which now operates under the name of AEA Technology under an increasingly commercial management. The business has changed substantially since the authority was set up in the 1950s to create a civil nuclear power programme. AEA has found markets in new, non-nuclear fields, such as the transport and aerospace industries. Since 1986 the agency has operated as a trading fund and sees privatisation as a natural next step. Last year it made a profit of Pounds 28m on a turnover of more than Pounds 400m. The main question mark over privatisation is what should happen to the agency's nuclear liabilities, covering radioactive sites such as the Dounreay fast reactor on the north coast of Scotland which is scheduled to stop operating next year. The liabilities are estimated to amount to Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn and the AEA is keen that they should be left behind in the public sector. Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, told MPs that he was appointing independent consultants to advise on the main ways in which this could be done. Their report is expected in the autumn. The AEA will be pressing the argument for being privatised as a single entity. Making the announcement, Mr Eggar referred to the report of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission last May which urged a further review of strategic options, including removing the AEA's business activities from the public sector.</p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / UK's Labour calls for more aid to Somalia BRITAIN'S opposition Labour party yesterday called for the UK's aid effort to famine-hit Somalia to be stepped up, acusing the government, the EC and the United Nations of 'dithering disgracefully'. Returning from a four-day visit to the area, Mr Tony Worthington, Labour overseas development spokesman, urged every EC country to donate an aircraft and immediately start flying in supplies. He called for the role of UN peacekeeping forces in Somalia to be clarified and for a UN conference of reconciliation between the local parties to be convened. Baroness Chalker, the overseas development minister, should visit the country to 'see for herself' the dreadful conditions prevailing, he said. The government retorted that Britain had been among the first countries to respond as 'new possibilities for delivery' had opened up, and said it had provided over Pounds 19m worth of emergency aid since January 1991. It said Baroness Chalker planned to visit Somalia next month with EC colleagues.</p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Serb and Croat leaders called to Bosnia talks INTERNATIONAL mediators yesterday summoned Mr Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's president, and Mr Franjo Tudjman, his Croat counterpart, back to Geneva in an effort to salvage the Bosnian peace talks. Last night's move appeared aimed at exerting pressure on Bosnia's president, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, to return to the talks, which will decide the republic's ethnic partition. For the second day Mr Izetbegovic refused to attend talks until Bosnian Serb forces withdrew from Mount Bjelasnica, a strategic peak southwest of Sarajevo. He also appeared to be waiting to see if Nato would launch air strikes on Bosnian Serb artillery laying siege to Sarajevo. A Nato council meeting in Brussels yesterday morning approved a US plan to use air strikes to break the siege. Mr Izetbegovic yesterday wrote to the United Nations and European Community appealing for urgent military help. Mr Reginald Bartholomew, US president Bill Clinton's peace envoy, returning from the Nato meeting, held talks with Bosnia's Moslem president in a bid to dissuade him from derailing the peace talks by holding out for western military intervention In London, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, warned that although Britain was prepared for military action, the Moslems should not stall the peace process by hoping for military aid. Bosnian Serb officials warned privately that if the Moslems boycotted the talks, Serbian and Croatian leaders would continue negotiations and exclude the Moslems from an agreement. The Moslem-led Bosnian delegation was plunged into deeper disarray when the three Croat members of Bosnia's collective leadership staged a walk-out in protest against a Moslem advance and attacks on Croat troops in central Bosnia. Mr Tudjman welcomed the Croatian protest. 'I think it will introduce more seriousness to the negotiations and lead Izetbegovic to stop offensive operations and ethnic cleansing against Croats,' he said. The White House welcomed the Nato agreement and stressed that the threat of force was real. But as a sign of the diplomatic disagreements still dogging the allied plans, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, again emphasised that only he could give the go-ahead for the air strikes.

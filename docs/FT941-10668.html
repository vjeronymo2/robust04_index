			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Maclean Hunter to mount offensive against Rogers Maclean Hunter, the Canadian publishing and cable-TV group, signalled yesterday it was planning a strong counter-offensive to a proposed takeover bid by Rogers Communications. MH also defused uncertainty over the status of the largest single block of shares in the company, apparently in the hope of prodding Rogers to show its hand. Rogers, which is Canada's biggest cable-TV group, last week proposed a 'strategic merger' with MH to create a multimedia company able to stand up to other European and North American conglomerates and Canada's powerful telephone companies. But analysts predicted yesterday that MH might try to thwart Rogers' ambitions by presenting itself, rather than Rogers, as the best vehicle for the creation of an enlarged Canadian multimedia conglomerate. MH has a far less onerous debt burden than Rogers. Its coffers would be swollen by up to CDollars 2bn (USDollars 1.5bn) from the expected sale of its US cable-TV businesses. Rogers has yet to put forward a firm offer. It said last Friday it would first ask the Ontario Securities Commission to rule whether the block of MH shares held by a company known as Maclean Hunter Holdings would have to be included in a bid. MH responded yesterday that MH Holdings, which is controlled by two MH subsidiaries and holds about 17 per cent of MH's shares, will not vote its shares either for or against any bid which conforms to a 1989 shareholder rights plan. The clarification means that an OSC ruling is no longer necessary. 'It is not the intention of either board (of MH or MH Holdings) to frustrate or prevent any reasonable and appropriate offer . . . made by Rogers or any other party,' MH said. Rogers late yesterday described MH's statement as 'inadequate' as it applies only to offers approved by the MH board. MH added it was 'exploring strategic alternatives to maximise shareholder value'. These include a recapitalisation, the spin-off of all or part of its Canadian cable-TV assets, and the formation of 'one or more alliances'. MH also said discussions were under way with prospective buyers of the valuable US cable-TV interests in Michigan, New Jersey and Florida. At its current share price of CDollars 17.25, MH is valued at CDollars 3.6bn. But analysts predict a bidder with any hope of success will need to offer considerably more than that.</p>

The UCL&hyph;55 and UCL&hyph;55 TORIC (ocufilcon C) Soft (hydrophilic) Contact Lenses are indicated for daily wear for the correction of visual acuity in not-aphakic persons with nondiseased eyes that are myopic (near-sighted) and hyperopic (farsighted). The spherical lens may be worn by persons who may exhibit astigmatism of 1.25 diopters (D) or less that does not interfere with visual acuity. The toric lens is indicated for the correction of astigmatism of 7.00 D or less. In addition, the lens is to be disinfected using a chemical lens care system. The application includes authorization from N &amp; N Contact Lens International, Inc., Lynwood, WA 98046, to incorporate information contained in the approved PMA and related supplements for the SOFTOUCH and SOFTOUCH TORIC (ocufilcon C) Soft (hydrophilic) Contact Lenses. In accordance with the provisions of section 515(c)(2) of the act as amended by the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, this PMA was not referred to the Ophthalmic Devices Panel, and FDA advisory panel, for review and recommendation because the information in the PMA substantially duplicates information previously reviewed by this panel. On March 7, 1994, CDRH approved the application by a letter to the applicant from the Acting Director of the Office of Device Evaluation, CDRH. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A summary of the safety and effectiveness data on which CDRH based its approval is on file in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) and is available from that office upon written request.

A petitioner may request either a formal hearing under part 12 (21 CFR part 12) of FDA's administrative practices and procedures regulations or a review of the application and CDRH's action by an independent advisory committee of experts. A petition is to be in the form of a petition for reconsideration under &sect;10.33(b) (21 CFR 10.33(b)). A petitioner shall identify the form of review requested (hearing or independent advisory committee) and shall submit with the petition supporting data and information showing that there is a genuine and substantial issue of material fact for resolution through administrative review. After reviewing the petition, FDA will decide whether to grant or deny the petition and will publish a notice of its decision in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . If FDA grants the petition, the notice will state the issue to be reviewed, the form of review to be used, the persons who may participate in the review, the time and place where the review will occur, and other details. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners may, at any time on or before June 6, 1994, file with the Dockets Management Branch (address above) two copies of each petition and supporting data and information, identified with the name of the device and the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document.

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Deals likely this year for Indonesia's Dollars 15bn gas field NEGOTIATIONS FOR the development of the giant Natuna gas field, which would carry Indonesia's liquefied natural gas industry into the next century, should be completed this year, industry officials have said. The Natuna field has reserves estimated at 45 trillion (million million) cubic feet and is situated north-east of Natuna island in the South China Sea. Esso Indonesia has a 50 per cent interest in the field, with Pertamina, Indonesia's state-owned oil and gas company, holding an equal stake. Development of the field, which would take eight years, is expected to cost about USDollars 15bn. More than half the cost is accounted for by the heavy platforms and technology required to handle the gas, which has a 70 per cent carbon dioxide content. Indonesia must bring the field on stream if it is successfully to renegotiate long-term LNG export contracts with Japan, which begin to expire in 1998. The contracts are supplied by the Arun field off north Sumatra but the latter has insufficient reserves to guarantee further 20 year contracts. An industry executive close to the negotiations said government officials accepted that an agreement had 'to be concluded soon for Natuna to come on stream by 1999. They recognise that Indonesia must catch the market whilst it still needs them'. 'Pertamina cannot raise the money, and government officials say Pertamina may reduce its stake in Natuna to 10 per cent. Whoever takes the 40 per cent will be expected to carry Pertamina's financing obligations,' the executive added.' Companies which have shown an interest in taking a stake in Natuna include Nissho Iwai, Mitsui, Mitsubishi and Mobil, the executive said. Negotiations between Pertamina and Esso include whether to build a new LNG processing plant on Natuna island, or to construct a pipeline and use existing facilities at Lhokseumawe, North Sumatra. Indonesia is the world's largest producer of LNG with exports in 1990 valued at USDollars 4bn. About 85 per cent of exports go to Japan, with other customers including Taiwan and South Korea. A gas field with reserves of about 4.5 trillion cu ft has been found by Asamera Oil Indonesia off the north coast of Sumatra, industry officials say. The reserve figures are based upon preliminary geological test data received by the Indonesian authorities and further tests are planned. Asamera, a subsidiary of Gulf Canada Resources, has not officially announced the size of the find but has said 'drilling indications are encouraging'. The find is close to the Arun field which currently feeds the six-train LNG facilities at Lhokseumawe. Asamera hold a 50 per cent stake in the 'Block A' contract area where the field is located. The company recently assigned the remaining interest to Aceh Gas and Oil, a Japanese consortium led by Japex. Under the deal, Aceh must fund the first USD70M of an on-going exploration and development programme. This includes the drilling of a further three exploratory wells later this year.</p>

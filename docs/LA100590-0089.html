			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> FALLEN ANGEL: If anyone could gloat over apparent demotion of Angels General  Manager Mike Port (C1), it's former Angel Bob Boone. . . . The popular catcher,  once named the team's co-MVP, jumped to Kansas City in 1988, signing for only  $1 more than his Angels salary. Team owner Gene Autry, shaken by Boone's  departure, praised Port with faint damns: "I think Mike could be a little more  friendly with people he deals with."  </P> <P> .. . But Boone, who still lives in Orange County, refuses to crow: "I don't  hate Mike Port. I'm not sure I can get a deal done with him." . . . And Boone  soon will be dealing. He said Thursday he'll be a free agent when the Royals  set him loose this month, but he's not saying whether he would consider  returning to Anaheim. Steve Emmons and Mark I. Pinsky  </P></p>

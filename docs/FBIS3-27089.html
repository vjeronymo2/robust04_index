			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, February 17 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese  official in charge of Hong Kong Affairs has reiterated China's  position that the Chinese side would not accept any unilateral  political reform scheme taken by the British-Hong Kong  authorities on the arrangement for the 1994-95 elections to be  held in Hong Kong.    China would like to have the 1994-95 electoral arrangements  in Hong Kong settled in the form of bilateral negotiation  between the Chinese and British Governments as the term of  office for the would-be members of the Legislative Council and  of district and urban councils will go through 1997, the year  for the transition of power in Hong Kong, said Zheng Guoxiong,  deputy director of the Hong Kong branch of the XINHUA NEWS  AGENCY after attending a local public gathering.    But the fact has been known to all, the British side had  announced, unilaterally, the termination of Sino-British talks  and put it into action by submitting Governor Chris Patten's  political reform bill to the Hong Kong Legislative Council,  Zheng said.    Under such circumstance, the term of office for members of  the three-tier councils will have to terminate on June 30, 1997  no matter what resolutions to be passed by the Hong Kong  Legislative Council, the deputy director stated.    The Chinese side will have the three-tier councils  re-elected  by July 1, 1997 in accordance with principles provided by the  Basic Law of the Future Government of the hong kong Special  Administrative Region, he added.    Zheng's speech was made after the Hong Kong Government  decided to gazette tomorrow a new regulation which sets out the  procedure for the registration of electors in geographical  constituencies for the three-tier elections.    China stated this consistent position time and again over  the  past months. The Chinese side passed on the message to the  British side when the governor gazetted part of his political  reform bill on the 1994-95 electoral arrangements and reiterated  its principle stand when Patten introduced his partial bill to  the Legislative Council.    He expressed that the Chinese side would speed up  preparations for the resumption of its exercise of sovereignty  over Hong Kong and called on the broad masses of Hong Kong  people to take part in the matter.    He assured local residents that China will adopt a positive  attitude in cooperation with the British-Hong Kong authorities  and in the solution of matters relating to the everyday life of  local residents.</p>

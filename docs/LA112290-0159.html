			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEE CASTLE; BIG-BAND TRUMPETER  </P> <P> Lee Castle, a trumpeter in the jazz tradition of Louis Armstrong and Bunny  Berigan and who was featured in many of the great bands of the 1930s and '40s,  has died in a Florida hospital, it was learned Wednesday.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for Memorial Hospital in Hollywood, Fla., said Castle -- most  recently leader of the Jimmy Dorsey band -- was 75 when he died Friday  following a heart attack.  </P> <P> Born Aniello Castaldo in New York, he began playing professionally at age 15  and by the mid-1930s was performing with Artie Shaw and then Ray McKinley.  </P> <P> He joined the Tommy Dorsey band in 1939, just as Frank Sinatra was being hired  as lead male vocalist, and three years later became Benny Goodman's ace jazz  trumpeter.  </P> <P> Throughout his career he was known for his full tone, extensive range and the  ability to play both in the New Orleans tradition of Armstrong and the sweet,  ballroom manner of Harry James.  </P> <P> He briefly led the combined Dorsey brothers bands after they merged in 1953 and  following the death of Jimmy Dorsey in 1957, Castle fronted that "ghost band."  </P> <P> He also led two bands of his own in the early 1940s but achieved his greatest  successes under other leaders.  </P> <P> Survivors include his wife, Virginia, of Elmsford, N.Y., three brothers and two  sisters.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APPLES;  </P> <P> MORE THAN JUST PLAIN DELICIOUS  </P> <P> The choice in apples used to be limited to Delicious, Golden Delicious and  McIntosh, with perhaps a handful of local varieties. Granny Smith, an  Australian import, joined the Big 3 about 15 years ago. These four apples still  account for more than two-thirds of the country's commercial crop. But other  varieties are coming on strong. Most weren't on the market 10 years ago. And  some -- Liberty, Gala, Criterion, Fuji, Akane -- you may never have even heard  of.  </P> <P> While Red Delicious apples were selling at below cost last year because of a  countrywide oversupply, Fuji and other new varieties were commanding top  dollar.  </P> <P> One beautiful apple just isn't enough any more. Consumers are demanding quality  apples and they want variety. "It's a diverse market," says Dr. Bruce H.  Barritt, horticulturist at the Washington State University Tree Fruit Research  Center in Wenatchee, Wash. "Don't try to tell a consumer which apple has the  best flavor."  </P> <P> To satisfy consumer and grower demand, plant breeders here and abroad have been  working on disease-resistant apples that taste better, are easier to grow and  keep longer. The development process is a lengthy one, taking from 22 to 40  years or more from the initial cross to the introduction of a new variety.  </P> <P> An important breakthrough was the development of new disease-resistant strains.  Liberty, a crisp apple now widely accepted in New England, was crossed at  Cornell University's New York State Agricultural Research Station at Geneva,  N.Y., in 1955 and introduced in 1978. Freedom was introduced four years later,  but it is still not yet widely available.  </P> <P> New apples are starting to replace McIntosh, a variety that will not ripen  uniformly without Alar. Empire, also developed at the New York State  Agricultural Research Station, is the most widely planted variety in the  Northeast. "It eats extremely well," says Ralph J. Baldasaro, head of the New  York and New England Apple Institute. "Empire has the tang of a Mac and the  sweetness of a Delicious." Not too surprising, since it is a cross between  McIntosh and Red Delicious.  </P> <P> Other McIntosh-type apples are gaining popularity: Jonamac in the East, and  Spartan, which was developed in British Columbia, in the West. Jonagold, a  Golden Delicious and Jonathan cross, was introduced by the New York Station in  1968 and is now the most widely planted apple in Europe. A large, yellow-red  apple with a rich flavor, it is excellent for cooking as well as eating  out-of-hand.  </P> <P> Fuji, the best-selling apple in Japan, may become the apple of the '90s in the  United States. Fuji does not look like much, but appearance is secondary to its  firm, crisp texture and sweet flavor. And this apple, better than any other so  far, retains its crispness after several months in a home refrigerator.  Grower-packer R.C. Greg McPherson and many of his neighbors in Wenatchee are  grafting Fuji onto Red Delicious stock. "You can knock them around," he says,  "and they keep forever."  </P> <P> Another Japanese import is Akane (pronounced ah-CON-nay). It has been dubbed  the "lunch box apple" because, says Kris Merritt of Merritt Orchards near  Bellingham in Western Washington, "It ripens right in the first part of  September, just in time for school." Old-timers come to Merritt's for the Akane  too; it reminds them of the old-fashioned snow apple known as Fameuse.  </P> <P> Mutsu is a Golden Delicious crossed with Indo, a Japanese variety. It is called  Crispin in Britain and parts of the Northeast, where it is grown extensively.  </P> <P> "We call it the Christmas apple," says Tom Berry, referring to the Mutsus he  grows along with 40 other new and unusual varieties at his Canyon Park Orchard,  north of Seattle. Mutsus can be eaten immediately, but Berry also hordes them:  He wraps them in newspaper and stores them out in a shed, his own version of  cold storage, where they yellow and sweeten as they mature.  </P> <P> Not all apples come from carefully controlled breeding programs. Criterion, a  large apple with a sprightly flavor, was found in an orchard near Wapato, in  Yakima Valley, Wash. It is thought to be a cross between Red and Golden  Delicious or Red Delicious and Winter Banana.  </P> <P> Ginger Gold is another so-called chance seedling. Clyde H. Harvey, a Virginia  apple grower, came across a small tree uprooted by Hurricane Camille in 1962.  He replanted it and it bore its first fruit in 1975. Ginger Duncan-Harvey,  Clyde's wife, describes Ginger Gold as crisp and very juicy. "It looks too good  to be true, just like a wax apple," she says, "but the taste is real, a  distinct sweet-tart flavor."  </P> <P> Apples are often divided into two groups: dessert apples, which are eaten  fresh, and cooking apples. A few varieties are good for both. There are three  kinds of cooking apples: apples such as Empire, that get mushy when cooked, and  hence make good applesauce; firm-fleshed apples that hold together, and are  good for pies and tarts (Jonagold); and tender-skin varieties that hold their  shape when baked (Melrose).  </P> <P> Here are some recipes that chefs have developed to use these new varieties of  apple.  </P> <P>  Chef Marcel DeSaulniers, of the Trellis Restaurant at Colonial Williamsburg,  Va., recommends using two kinds of apples for this moist loaf cake. It makes a  good take-along for a fall picnic; it keeps well.  </P> <P> APPLE-RAISIN LOAF CAKE  </P> <P> 1 1/2 pounds sweet and tart apples (such as combination of Criterion, Melrose,  Fuji and Jonagold)  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice  </P> <P> 1/2 cup dry white wine  </P> <P> 1/4 cup light brown sugar, packed  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon  </P> <P> 3/4 cup raisins  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon shortening  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon plus 3 cups flour  </P> <P> 1/4 cup sour cream  </P> <P> 1/4 cup buttermilk  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons baking powder  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon baking soda  </P> <P> 1 cup granulated sugar  </P> <P> 1/2 cup unsalted butter  </P> <P> 3 eggs  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> Core and chop 1 unpeeled thin-skinned apple. Place in bowl along with 1 cup  water and lemon juice.  </P> <P> Quarter and core remaining unpeeled apples. Combine with wine, 1/4 cup water,  brown sugar, salt and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in 2 1/2-quart saucepan. Cover and  bring to boil over medium-high heat.

Discard skins. Drain reserved chopped apples and  add to strained apples along with raisins. Cool.  </P> <P> Lightly coat (9x5-inch) metal loaf pan with shortening and sprinkle with 1  tablespoon flour. Shake out excess.  </P> <P> Whisk together sour cream and buttermilk and set aside. Combine remaining 3  cups flour, remaining 1 teaspoon cinnamon, baking powder and baking soda and  set aside.  </P> <P> Combine granulated sugar and butter in bowl of electric mixer. Beat on medium  speed 4 minutes and scrape down sides. Beat on high speed 3 minutes and scrape  down bowl. Beat on high speed 2 minutes more or until thoroughly creamed,  scraping down bowl.  </P> <P> Add eggs 1 at time, beating on high speed 20 seconds and scraping down bowl  after adding each egg. Beat mixture on high speed 2 minutes. Add cooled apple  mixture and vanilla (mixture may break). Mix on low speed 10 to 15 seconds.  </P> <P> Add flour mixture and beat on low speed 30 seconds. Add sour cream mixture and  mix on low speed 1 minute. Remove from mixer and finish mixing batter with  rubber spatula until smooth and thoroughly combined.  </P> <P> Pour batter into prepared pan, spreading evenly. Bake at 325 degrees 1 hour and  25 minutes or until wood pick inserted in center of bread comes out clean. Cool  in pan 15 minutes. Remove and cool to room temperature. Cut into 16 slices.  Makes 1 loaf or 16 (1/2-inch) slices.  </P> <P>  Stang is a Seattle writer.  </P> <P>  Swiss-born Kaspar Donier, chef/owner of Kaspar's by the Bay overlooking Puget  Sound in Seattle, combines Northwest ingredients with classic French, Asian and  regional American cuisines to create his own unique style.  </P> <P> KASPAR'S VEAL MEDALLIONS WITH APPLE-BRANDY SAUCE  </P> <P> 4 cooking or all-purpose apples (such as Criterion, Jonagold or Fuji)  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons sugar  </P> <P> 1 pound veal tenderloin or cutlets  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon peanut oil  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons chopped shallots  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons apple brandy, such as Clear Creek from Oregon  </P> <P> 6 tablespoons Washington State semillon or other white wine  </P> <P> 1 cup whipping cream  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons chopped parsley  </P> <P> Nutmeg  </P> <P> Fresh thyme sprigs for garnish  </P> <P> Core and peel apples and slice into 3/4-inch thick rounds.

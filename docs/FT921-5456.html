			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / UK Company News: T Cowie bucks sector trend with 61% advance to Pounds 18.2m T COWIE yesterday appeared as the light at the beginning of the tunnel in what is expected to be a dismal season for motor-related results. Against the trend, it reported a 61 per cent increase in pre-tax profit from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 18.2m. The share price, which has nearly quadrupled since early last year, gained a further 3p to close at 138p. Cowie, which is the UK's largest company car leasing operator as well as a motor dealer, benefited partly from reduced interest rates - its Achilles' heel in the past - but also from increased car sales. Although used cars contributed far more to pre-tax profit than new ones, the number of new cars sold was increased in a year when the UK total fell by 21 per cent. Sir Tom Cowie, chairman, has often said that every 1 percentage point fall in interest rates adds Pounds 2.4m to the group's bottom line. With base rates falling from 14 to 11 per cent between February and July last year, Cowie's annual interest bill came down from Pounds 44.7m to Pounds 36.3m. This more than offset a small squeeze on operating profit of Pounds 54.5m (Pounds 56m) as turnover advanced by 5 per cent to Pounds 564.9m (Pounds 536.5m). In the Cowie Interleasing finance division, pre-tax profit rose by 46 per cent to Pounds 11m on sales of Pounds 208.8m (Pounds 198.7m). Mr Neil Pykett, director, said the fleet had been expanded from 53,000 vehicles in 1990 to more than 61,000 now. In the motor division, pre-tax profit rose by 37 per cent to a record Pounds 6.61m (Pounds 4.82m) on sales of Pounds 316.5m (Pounds 276m). A large order from Hertz UK showed through in an increase in new car sales from 29,000 to nearly 31,000. Mr Iain Jane, director, said new cars only contributed 6 per cent to the division's profit. Used cars accounted for 33 per cent as sales went up from just over 8,000 to 10,500 units. Workshops, bodyshops and parts contributed 53 per cent. Cowie's net debt - mostly related to the fleet  - grew to Pounds 355.2m (Pounds 328.7m), with gearing stable at 385 per cent. The increase in borrowings followed spending of Pounds 148m on renewing the fleet plus Pounds 45m to fund acquisitions. Fully diluted earnings per share rose to 11.11p (7.22p). A final dividend of 3.375p makes a total of 4.875p (3.7p). COMMENT To produce a pre-tax profit figure second only to the Pounds 25.1m of booming 1988 is quite an achievement in a year which could hardly be more different. Cowie has proved right those who said it was a classic interest rate play - rather than a candidate for insolvency. But more than that, it has proved the fundamental quality of its car leasing and dealing businesses. Part of this rests on the synergy between the two: Interleasing buys from its sister organisation, while the retail business has a ready supply of used cars. Just as important are the symptoms of good housekeeping: a conservative approach to residual values - the undoing of others, the spreading of overheads, early pruning of poorly performing activities. With pre-tax profit forecast to reach Pounds 23m to Pounds 25m this year, the prospective multiple is about 9.5. The perceived risk attached to highly geared leasing groups has dictated a discount and the shares may pause after a fine run. Medium term there is scope for more.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Radioactivity worry at Kazakh field A NEW potential hazard has emerged for companies wishing to invest in the former Soviet Union's energy sector: radioactivity. British Gas is carrying out an environmental study of the Karachaganak oil and gas field in north-western Kazakhstan to check whether it was contaminated by a number of underground nuclear explosions carried out in the area between 1962 and 1987. The company, together with the Italian state-owned oil company Agip, won exclusive rights to negotiate for the development of the field in July. The testing involved smaller nuclear devices designed for peaceful purposes, rather than weapons, which were tested at Semipalatinsk, 600 miles away in north-east Kazakhstan. The two latest tests were in 1984 and 1987. Although the detonations were on the periphery of Karachaganak, rather than on the field itself, experts say there could still be a risk of contamination. The company insisted yesterday it was aware throughout negotiations with the Kazakhs that the area had been a nuclear testing site. Two initial studies, carried out by British Gas and Agip, and Control Risks, the security consultants, had found no radioactivity, but the full environmental survey now under way would include further radiation checks. 'We are 99 per cent satisfied that there is no problem,' BG said yesterday. British Gas and Agip hope to sign a contract to develop the field by next summer, likely to entail investment of Dollars 6bn over the first ten years, and up to Dollars 20bn over the 40-year life of the field. With 20 trillion (million million) cubic feet of gas and 2bn barrels of oil, the field is one of the biggest in the world. The field will help British Gas to achieve its aim of increasing earnings from exploration and production, and will increase Agip's oil and gas reserves by about 50 per cent.</p>

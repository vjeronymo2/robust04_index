			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> A SPECIAL TEACHER UNIFIES HER CLASS  </P> <P> When Marianne Stjern walked into her classroom at Webber Elementary School for  the first time last September, she thought she had entered her worst nightmare.  </P> <P> It was chaos, with the children out of control and not showing any respect for  their Swedish-born teacher, who was in charge of a fifth grade in the United  States for the first time. At the end of that disastrous day, a dispirited  Stjern marched to Principal Richard Weaver's office and quit.  </P> <P> But Weaver and district administrators had a special feeling about Stjern and  persuaded her to give the class another try.  </P> <P> "When I hire teachers, I look for people who have that spark, who are excited  and have a love of teaching and I saw that in Marianne," said Barbara Winars,  assistant superintendent of personnel services. "She has tremendously high  standards, and she was unsure that she could do a good job. But I knew she was  the best thing that could have happened to those kids."  </P> <P> Now, seven months later, Stjern, 36, has proven Winars' instincts correct as  she now presides over what she describes as a controlled, although still  energetic, group of students. She said the turning point came in December when  she taught the melting pot of Latino, Vietnamese and Caucasian children a  Swedish Christmas song called "Santa Lucia."  </P> <P> "That's when we really got together," Stjern said, her Swedish accent still  apparent after eight years in the United States. "We had a special bond because  we all knew Swedish. After that, I was excited to come back in January and  begin the second half of the year."  </P> <P> Stjern wondered during Christmas vacation how she could build on the momentum  she had gained in order to further unify the class, which had a tendency to  divide into racial cliques.  </P> <P> That opportunity came when the 34 students began their study of the United  States. As a way to help the children remember where the states were, Stjern  had them begin work on a giant, quilt-like map that was completed just last  week.  </P> <P> The colorful quilt is the focal point of the portable classroom where Stjern  and her students spend their day. With its plethora of colors and designs, it  is a symbol of their unity and continues to serve as a learning tool.  </P> <P> "During recess or at lunch, some of the kids will come into the classroom and  quiz each other on the states on their own time," Stjern said. "It's fun for  them and it's good for me to see them so excited about learning."  </P> <P> Paula Ramos, 10, proudly said that she was the first student to remember the  locations of all 50 states. Ramos, her dark brown hair in a braid, smiled shyly  when asked about her popular teacher.  </P> <P> "I think she's just so nice and so funny," Paula said. "She tells us about  where she used to live and she has a really neat accent."  </P> <P> Mike Smith, 10, said the students like Stjern because she has made learning  fun.  </P> <P> "She thinks different from any other teacher I've had," Mike said. "She makes  every subject, even math and spelling, fun. She's really smart and artistic  too."  </P> <P> Adjusting to the education system in the United States has been difficult for  Stjern. In Sweden, teachers get a fourth-grade class and follow it for three  years. Then, they follow the same students in one subject for three years after  that. Stjern wishes she could spend a similar length of time with her present  students, instead of only one year.  </P> <P> "Now, I know these kids," Stjern said, "I have them where I want them only to  have to let them go."

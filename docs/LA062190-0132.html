			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> TREE EXPERTS EXPLAIN HOW TO OBTAIN MORE  </P> <P> If you want more trees to grace your city but don't have the tax money to buy  them, try starting an adopt-a-tree program or creating a memorial tree park.  </P> <P> Those were a few of the suggestions that Northern California experts offered  Wednesday during a daylong workshop in Anaheim for turning urbanized Orange  County into a greener place.  </P> <P> About 150 people -- mostly parks and recreation officials from several cities  and counties -- listened intently to members of California ReLeaf, the  Sacramento Tree Foundation and the East Bay Regional Parks Foundation, who  described the latest tactics in "releafing" the county.  </P> <P> "We all need to care more about the trees; but it's all new to a lot of us,"  Yucaipa Councilwoman Lillian Eaton said.  </P> <P> Sponsored by California ReLeaf, which is part of the American Forestry Assn.'s  Global ReLeaf program, the conference was an attempt to encourage Southern  California cities to become more involved in planting and caring for trees.  </P> <P> Local governments in Northern California are often thought to be the state's  leaders in environmental concerns, and the sponsors brought lessons learned in  that area.  </P> <P> Isabel Wade, director of urban forestry for California ReLeaf, told department  leaders that they need to involve residents and arouse community interest,  which in turn will encourage local politicians to find funding and other types  of support.  </P> <P> "You've got to build the base of public support, because without that the  politicians are not going to lead," Wade said.  </P> <P> Janet Cobb, executive director of the East Bay Regional Parks District, also  discussed the need for community involvement in planting and caring for trees.  She said that with city budget crunches, many local governments will need to  rely on more help from volunteers if seedlings are to grow.  </P> <P> Jerry Crum, parks services manager for Anaheim, said the workshop was helpful.  </P> <P> "Often citizens are tired of their trees because they're tired of raking up  leaves," Crum said. "This is good because it helps us explain to them the  importance of trees." LISA MASCARO  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lars Villemoes: "Shots in Lyngby"] </F>   [Text] The police believe that the motive for the attempted  murder of a Kurd should be sought in his activity as leader of  the Kurdistan Committee, the group that acts as spokesman for  the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), a Kurdish terrorist  organization.    Terrorism came to the suburbs and drew an ugly trail of  blood  through the Danish routine when 30-year-old Imdat Yilmaz, a  politically active Turkish-speaking Kurd, was gunned down  outside the front door of his home in a housing complex at 21  Lundtoftegardsvej in Lyngby on 7 February. On his way home from  the bakery at 0815 hours with some bread for breakfast, Yilmaz  was hit twice in the stomach as well as in the chest and upper  left arm by four shots fired from a 7.65mm pistol by a  perpetrator waiting at the entrance.    The victim, who came close to losing his life in the  attempted murder, has said in a few statements to the police  that he could not recognize the would-be assassin. A neighbor  who walked out of the building's elevator happened to be present  when two of the shots at Yilmaz were fired and called the  police. The witness could provide only a sketchy description of  a dark-skinned man, 30 to 40 years old, 180-185 cm tall and  armed with a pistol, who at the time of the shooting was dressed  in a black jogging suit with the hood tied.    On orders from the leader of the investigation, Detective  Inspector Gerhard Rohwer of the Lyngby Police, policemen from  the Copenhagen Police Force's special unit, armed with  submachine guns, moved out and arrested 20 Turkish Kurds who had  gathered for a news conference about the attempted murder at the  Kurdistan Committee premises in the Vesterbro district of  Copenhagen. The police responded to a tip that the assault could  be connected with an internal power struggle in the milieu, but  apparently nothing incriminating was found during the search of  the conference room and the arrested Kurds were released from  custody in Valby the same evening after they had been identified.  <H5>  Motives </H5>   According to the police, the motive for the attempted murder  of the currently unemployed Yilmaz should be sought in his  activity as leader of the Kurdistan Committee, the group in  Denmark that speaks for the terrorist Kurdish separatist  organization, PKK.    Yilmaz has continually written letters to the newspapers  (the  most recent one appeared in WEEKENDAVISEN on 7 January) and made  political statements defending both the PKK's war in Turkey and  militant Kurdish activism aimed at Turkish interests in other  countries. When two asylum-seeking Turks of Kurdish descent  participated in an internationally coordinated PKK action  involving attempted arson at Turkish Airlines and two Turkish  national offices for tourism and trade in Copenhagen on 4  November last year, Yilmaz told JYLLANDS-POSTEN: "I am convinced  that there will be more attacks."    Immediately after the police searched the premises in  Vesterbro, Yilmaz's political comrades in arms aimed their fire  at the Turkish Embassy, which was accused of being behind the  murder attempt. Spokesman Ali Celik stated that "the Turkish  Embassy is behind this. They have the power for it and they  carried it out."    Kemal Koc also made a statement to DR-TV [Danish  Television].  He has previously been affiliated with the urban guerilla group  Dev Sol [expansion unknown], which specialized in the execution  of policemen in Turkey. The 36-year-old Norrebro storekeeper is  now one of the Kurdistan Committee's leading figures. He stated  as a fact that "over 30 members of the Turkish intelligence  service work at the Turkish Embassy under diplomatic immunity."  Faruk Logoglu, Turkey's ambassador, responded by condemning  criminal behavior and urging the Kurdistan Committee to go to  the police with any evidence it has of the embassy's involvement.    So far no evidence has been forthcoming and there is a  similar lack of evidence on the international level that the  PKK's adversaries in Turkey resort to liquidations outside the  borders of their country. Right-wing extremist Alpaslan Turkes'  terrorist organization, the Gray Wolves, has members in Germany  and has the fanaticism to carry out assassinations. But the  organization does not have a foothold in Denmark, where the  majority of Turkish immigrants are of Kurdish descent. Another  of the PKK's mortal enemies, the fundamentalist  Hizbollah-contra, carries out liquidations in Turkey, but is not  known to be active outside the country.    On the other hand there are numerous examples showing that  the PKK executes its dissidents and deserters both inside and  outside Turkey. A rank-and-file dissident, Mustafa Tanguner, was  liquidated by the PKK in Brondby in November 1985 and one of the  PKK's powerful defectors, lawyer and European affairs spokesman  Huseyin Yildirim, survived the PKK's attempt to liquidate him in  the Netherlands in 1989 by the skin of his teeth. PKK chief  Abdullah Ocalan's wife, Kesire, escaped her death sentence by  going into underground exile in Sweden.    After numerous examples of internationally coordinated  assassination attempts and acts of violence, the PKK and scores  of its subsidiary organizations were banned as terrorist groups  in France and Germany in November 1993. Both countries have  furnished the PKK with idealistic cannon fodder for years in the  form of young second-generation immigrants who worked in Kurdish  cultural societies, for example, and were then recruited to the  organization's army, the ARGK [People's Liberation Army of  Kurdistan].    The two countries' decision to ban the PKK was also based on  evidence of the organization's extensive involvement in the  smuggling and sale of drugs and the PKK's systematic extortion  of money from business people and wage-earning Turkish  immigrants in Europe. On 30 January of this year, for instance,  four men with ties to the PKK were arrested in Marseilles and  charged with extorting money from other immigrants. The chief of  the criminal police in Bayern said a week ago that many Kurds  are still being beaten or threatened with death if they do not  pay up.    After the attack on Yilmaz, Kurdistan Committee spokesman  Zeynel Cevik told DR-TV that the committee's support of the PKK  "does not include financial support." But in an interview with  WEEKENDAVISEN on 9 November 1992 another committee spokesman,  Ali Celik, made no secret of the fact that the PKK receives  billions of kroner annually from Kurds in Europe. Presented with  statements from Kurds living in Denmark who said they did not  feel safe unless they paid up, he replied: "The tax people don't  like it if you don't pay your taxes."    The latest information WEEKENDAVISEN has gathered from  sources in the Turkish immigrant community continues to give the  impression that the donations are not entirely voluntary. On the  contrary, the PKK is said to have stepped up its demands for  money from Turkish Kurds in Denmark recently.    The motive for the attempt on the life of the Kurdistan  Committee's leader, Imdat Yilmaz, may lie in one or more of the  above-mentioned circumstances.  <H5>  Smoke Screen </H5>   The PKK milieu, which opposes the country's lawful  authorities, is organized in a number of associations under  names that include words like "Kurdish," "workers," "culture"  and "society." And immediately after the assassination attempt,  Kurdistan Committee spokesmen reacted against the police  statement that Yilmaz is chairman of the committee. An attempt  was made to tone down his political position with assertions  that he merely has ties to one of the Kurdish community's  cultural societies. But these statements do not tally with the  fact that the telephone number at the Kurdistan Committee's new  address at 1 Dannebrogsgade in the Vesterbro district in  Copenhagen is listed with the Copenhagen Telephone Company  (KTAS) in Yilmaz's name.    Nor do they tally with the fact that Yilmaz publicly turned  up to meet the PKK-friendly Kurdish members of the Turkish  parliament, Leya Zana and Ali Yigit, when they visited the  Danish Folketing on 14 January. Yilmaz's prominent position is  further underlined by the fact that he has served as editor of  the Kurdistan Committee's propaganda paper, KURDISTAN RAPPORT.  The paper was originally called NYT FRA KURDISTAN and was the  official organ of the PKK front organization ERNK (Eniya  Rizgaria Netewa Kurdistan [National Liberation Front of  Kurdistan]).    Yilmaz comes from the village of Bulduk and thus, like other  leading PKK stalwarts in Denmark, from the area around  Cihanbeyli in Konya Province in central Anatolia. The  authorities in Konya have never issued Imdat Yilmaz a passport.  But he has a high status in Kurdish circles in Denmark, as could  be seen in an internal election held in Copenhagen between 20  and 22 November 1992 when he was the official candidate for a  seat in Kurdistan Ulusal Meclisi (KUM), Kurdistan's so-called  National Assembly -- an illegal "parliament" that is the PKK's  attempt to give its terrorist activities a legalistic gloss  outside the area of southeastern Anatolia that they want to  secede from Turkey.    The PKK's branches in Europe have openly expressed  solidarity  with Northern Ireland's IRA, among others, and have been in  contact in London with the drug-financed Peruvian guerilla army,  the Shining Path. And in Denmark too they cooperate with  pro-terrorist figures on the extreme left. Among other things,  Yilmaz has been in close contact with Austrian Alfred Lang's  sect of Autonome Revolutionaire, whose now closed store at 12  Blagardsgade in Norrebro was used for PKK propaganda meetings.    As editor of KURDISTAN RAPPORT Yilmaz also worked with  people  linked to the militant "anti-imperialist" group, the Red  Brigade, which applauds armed struggle and bank robberies, and  in solidarity with the PKK committed acts of vandalism that  caused over 300,000 kroner worth of damage to two Turkish  national offices in Copenhagen on 2 April 1992.    The PKK can mobilize many hundreds of sympathizers for  demonstrations in Copenhagen. But out of approximately 18,000  Turks of Kurdish descent in Denmark only 2,155 voted in what the  Kurdistan Committee regarded as the successful candidate  selection for the "Kurdistan National Assembly" in November  1992, in which Kemal Koc was victorious. Thus despite claims to  be identical with the "Kurds in Denmark" -- as the PKK wrote in  a flyer following an act of vandalism against Turkish Airlines  on 22 August 1992 -- the PKK's Danish front organization is far  from being able to count on the support of all Denmark Turkish  Kurds.</p>

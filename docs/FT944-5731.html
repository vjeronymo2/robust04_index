			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Manufacturing activity on rise US manufacturing activity continued to expand rapidly in November with production hitting its highest level for 11 years, the National Association of Purchasing Managers reported yesterday. The NAPM index rose to 61.2 per cent from 59.7 per cent in October, while the association's production index climbed to 66.7 per cent from 64.2 per cent in October. Mr Ralph Kauffman, manager of procurement at Oryx Energy and chairman of the association's business survey committee, said the advance was spread across all but three of the 20 industrial sectors. The strongest growth was in printing and publishing, paper, furniture, leather, petroleum, plastics and rubber and transportation equipment industries. The NAPM index of prices paid to suppliers fell in November, but this was a result of seasonal adjustment factors. Mr Kauffman said all 20 sectors were still reporting higher prices.</p>

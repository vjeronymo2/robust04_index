			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / World Trade News: ICI hopes risky gamble will pay off in Taiwan IMPERIAL Chemical Industries (ICI), Britain's biggest manufacturing company, yesterday opened its largest single product plant, a 350,000-tonne-a-year pure terephthalic acid (PTA) unit in Taiwan. The Pounds 150m facility, the biggest investment in Taiwan by a foreign group, is part of ICI's strategy of expansion in the Asia-Pacific region. However, the investment - a substantial one, given the whole group allocated only Pounds 776m to capital expenditure last year - is a high-risk gamble. The group is expected to make a profit of only Pounds 610m this year, compared with Pounds 843m last year and a peak in 1989 of Pounds 1.5bn. ICI's investment comes at a time when the market for PTA, used to manufacture polyester for textiles, bottles and films, is struggling. Since the plant's construction began in 1989 Asian prices have fallen by about 15 per cent to Dollars 540 a tonne. The PTA price fall has been driven by slowing demand growth - down from 12 per cent a year in the 1980s to 8 per cent - and capacity increases. In Asia alone, 10 PTA plants with a combined capacity of more than 2m tonnes a year have come on stream since 1989. Worldwide capacity is 9m tonnes a year, while demand is only 8m tonnes. However, ICI, the world's second largest manufacturer of PTA after Amoco of the US, believes its investment is strategically correct. 'PTA is one of the few growth opportunities at present available in the petrochemical industry,' Mr Mike Brogden, chief executive of ICI chemicals and polymers, said. The British company is gambling that despite the present glut, a PTA shortage will occur in Asia during the mid-1990s. Regional demand is at present about 5.1m tonnes a year. Although theoretically there is about 5.3m tonnes capacity in Asia, PTA is hard to manufacture and actual production is about 4.4m tonnes, ICI said. By the middle of the decade, it hopes regional demand will be 6m tonnes a year with theoretical production also at 6m tonnes and actual production at 5.1m tonnes. Three new units with a combined annual capacity of 750,000 tonnes are due to come on stream before 1996, according to Mr David Hewitt, ICI's international PTA business manager. ICI hopes any increase in Asian demand will not draw in extra imports from the US, currently some 700,000 tonnes a year. 'For once, we appear to have got our timing about right. We're probably coming on stream only six months too early,' says Mr Hewitt. Asian PTA prices will tighten by as much as 15 per cent by 1995, he believes. 'We need to make cash at the bottom of the cycle and generate lots at the top. Even at present prices we are putting cash into the coffers.' ICI's PTA business, which now generates Pounds 200m turnover a year, is set for rapid expansion, Mr Brogden says. He expects PTA sales to rise to Pounds 320m by 1994 as annual production increases from 500,000 to 900,000 tonnes. Within five or six years, PTA will represent 25 per cent of the chemicals and polymers' annual turnover which was last year nearly Pounds 3bn. The group's first PTA plant in Asia will not be its last, Mr Hewitt adds. The group will be looking to construct a new plant within five years. One possible location is China. But before ICI can consider expanding further, its PTA business must pay its way. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, warned yesterday the group was not interested in making investments that did not make money. Operations must generate significant profits to justify further capital spending.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (36): Regulators battle to catch up - Securities market IF THERE was ever any doubt that China is a nation of traders and gamblers, then the enthusiasm for company shares which has developed over the past three years has settled it decisively. The stock market is the point at which the national craving to get rich quickly and the government's desire to see a greater role for market forces intersect. The frenzied buying of shares a year ago may have subsided, but the country is in thrall to stock markets. Kerb-side dealers in unofficial shares and bonds have grown like Topsy on the street corners of many Chinese cities, especially those inland. This enthusiasm for securities has, however, not come without a measure of downside risk. Earlier this year one Beijing company, which had illegally issued Yn1bn in loan securities, failed, leaving disgruntled investors with a pile of worthless bonds. In Shenzhen last August, more than 1m people rioted when an inadequate system for issuing shares in soon-to-be-listed companies combined with official corruption, to deprive investors of a fair chance to participate in the new offerings. Although there is little - short of exhortation - that the authorities can do to control kerb markets, they have moved decisively to damp the frenzy surrounding new issues. Officials - though not their families - have been banned from participating in the stock market; a lot of effort has been put into telling retail investors that shares can go down in value as well as up; and, the rules for new issues have been changed to make participation in them less profitable. At the end of September, there were 46 companies listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and 80 on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. In Shanghai, up to five companies are being added to the official every week, and the authorities expect to have 100 companies listed by the end of 1993. With the growth in the number of stocks traded has come an explosion in the number of securities companies: 205 in Shenzhen, including 10 foreigners, and 448 in Shanghai, including 26 foreign brokers. On both exchanges, foreign brokers are allowed to trade only B shares, of which there are 13 in Shanghai and 20 in Shenzhen. In total, B share flotations have raise Dollars US1bn since 1991. The amount of capital raised through A share issues is harder to determine; neither the Shenzhen or Shanghai stock exchanges collect figures on capital raisings, preferring instead to talk about market capitalisation. However, according to one Hong Kong brokerage A share issues have raise around Yn6n since December 1990. China's adoption of computerised stock trading - where orders are matched by computer and trading is paperless - has enabled securities companies to offer real time stock trading on either the Shanghai or Shenzhen exchanges virtually anywhere in China. In Shenzhen itself an investor can dial a computer and transact an order over the telephone. It is hardly surprising that such rapid growth has overtaken the ability of the regulators to police the market. Says Mr Xu Qing Xiong, chairman, Shanghai International Securities Co: 'Many listed companies are not following what they said they would when they issued their prospectuses. We need more regulation to check and make sure companies follow their prospectuses.' The two stock exchanges and the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) are acutely aware of this problem - which has been the source of much criticism by foreign brokers - and its associated problems of the timely reporting of market sensitive information and the publication of accounts based on western accounting standards. According to Mr Gao Xi-qing, general counsel at the CSRC in Beijing, the CSRC has set up a working party to study how best to enforce compliance with the regulations. 'We are fully aware of the complaints; the government does have the intention to force companies to publish more information.' Part of the regulatory problem stems from a division of responsibilities between the People's Bank, China's central bank, and the CSRC. The People's Bank, which licenses securities dealers, has opposed the rapid development of the securities industry, mistakenly seeing it as a threat to the banks. The compromise which created the CSRC late last year left the regulator only with the power to supervise securities companies. This has meant that the CSRC - which is dedicated to the rapid development of a western-style market in China - has had to be ingenious in its attempt to improve the quality of dealers. It has done this through its power to approve the underwriting of new issues. Securities companies have found that to underwrite securities the CSRC applies a standard 'fit and proper' set of criteria to them, or licensing by another name. The difficulties the division of labour between the regulator and the People's Bank may be overcome when a new securities law is published next year. Modelled on the US Securities Exchange Commission, this will vest much wider powers in the CSRC.</p>

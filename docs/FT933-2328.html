			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / BMW Rolls-Royce in talks on new engine for DC9s BMW ROLLS-ROYCE, the aero-engine joint venture between the UK power group and the German luxury carmaker, is in talks with McDonnell Douglas of the US to provide new engines for old DC9 jets. The programme, which may initially involve up to 150 of the twin-engine airliners built 25 years ago, would represent a breakthrough for BMW Rolls-Royce in its efforts to develop a BR700 family of engines ranging from 12,000lb to 22,000lb thrust to power corporate jets and regional 100-seat airliners. The three-year-old joint venture has won orders from Gulfstream and Canadair to power new business jets with its 15,000lb thrust BR710 engine. The two companies see a bigger market in the 100-120 seat airliner sector for its more powerful 20,000lb thrust BR715 engine. Apart from the DC9 negotiations with McDonnell Douglas, the joint venture is also planning to offer the BR715 to power the proposed twin-engine RJX regional jet, which British Aerospace and Taiwan Aerospace are considering developing in their new joint venture. BMW Rolls-Royce executives have held preliminary talks with Taiwan Aerospace and are offering Taiwan some component manufacturing if the BR715is eventually selected for the RJX. The talks with McDonnell Douglas follow the US group's decision to offer financially weaker airlines an upgraded DC9 as a cheaper alternative to acquiring new aircraft. The upgrade, which would involve new engines meeting more stringent noise and emission standards as well as new cockpit avionics, would stretch the life of the DC9 by 15 years. It would provide a new approach to helping financially strapped airlines to finance their fleet renewal programmes, since a fully refurbished DC9 is expected to cost about Dollars 18m (Pounds 11.6m), against Dollars 30m-Dollars 35m for a new twin-engine 100-120 seater. McDonnell Douglas is already in advanced negotiations with Air Canada and Finnair to upgrade a total of 42 DC9s. The two airlines are expected to decide whether to accept the DC9 offer or buy new aircraft by the end of this year. Other airlines with large DC9 fleets include Northwest with 147, USAir with 73, Continental with 34, TWA with 46 and SAS with 36. Overall, there are nearly 750 DC9s which will have to be either upgraded to meet new standards or be replaced with new aircraft. McDonnell Douglas is seeking to maintain its share of the twin-engine airliner market with this programme, against intense competition from Boeing, which recently launched the 737X, and the European Airbus A320. Boeing is developing the faster, longer-range 737X as a replacement for older 737s as well as an eventual replacement for DC9s. Rolls-Royce and its partners in the International Aero Engine consortium, which manufactures the V2500 engine, have decided not to compete for 737X business against the Franco-American CFM International partnership of GE and Snecma, which has long dominated the 737 market. Sir Ralph Robins, the Rolls-Royce chairman, said: 'We saw no point in entering the 737X competition.' Talks on sale of BAe satellite division to restart, Page 19</p>

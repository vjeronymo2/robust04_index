			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Senegal poll violence claims 26 Voting began yesterday in Senegal's presidential election, with separatist violence claiming 26 lives, Reuter reports from Dakar. Twenty people were killed when a truck carrying voters of the ruling Socialist party hit a landmine in the troubled southern Casamance province. The explosion came just 24 hours after six people were killed when rebels ambushed a taxi in the same area. Political analysts say President Abdou Diouf is tipped to win, but the race will probably be close. The spread of candidates and new rules will probably mean a run off on March 7.</p>

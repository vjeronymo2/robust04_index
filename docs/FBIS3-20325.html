			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Franz Sommerfeld: "Not So Much a Gambler as an </F> Upright Swabian"]    [Text] The Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] is  stumbling into the most severe crisis of its history this super  election year. The party is headed by Klaus Kinkel, a  politician whom party colleagues and opponents alike consider to  be overstrained.    Things are not easy for Klaus Kinkel. Each week brings a new  disaster. The FDP chairman still had not recovered from his  party's election defeats in Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein  when he was confronted with new problems: Next weekend, the  expansion of the European Union [EU] might fail for the time  being. While flying from Moscow to Paris last week, domestic  horror reports reached the foreign minister. If elections are  held in Potsdam in June, then his party will face the next fall  below the magic 5 percent.  <H5>  Rumbustious Ventriloquist </H5>   In the view of leading FDP politicians, Kinkel is  responsible  for many crises. Under Genscher, the disaster in Lower Saxony  would have been avoided. "Genscher," one of the politicians  says, "would have guided the Lower Saxons toward a  social-liberal coalition right from the beginning. With the  slogan of preventing a red-green coalition or Schroeder's solo  government, they would have entered the Landtag. However,  turning half-heartedly toward the Social Democratic Party of  Germany [SPD] eight days before the elections just looks like  opportunism." Genscher led the party, even when Lambsdorff was  already chairman. But Kinkel, the accusation says, does not  lead, but just lets business run along. When he reacts, he is  rambunctious.    "A rambunctious ventriloquist," a Foreign Ministry official  says mockingly, referring to the appearances of his supreme  boss. Some top officials have already asked for transfers to  German embassies abroad. They dislike the German foreign  minister's inclination to pursue policy more with his guts than  with his mind. Kinkel likes pounding the table. Last Wednesday  [23 March], he elevated the return of the cultural assets  captured during World War II "to a test" of German-Russian  relations and energetically threatened with "unfavorable"  strains on "overall relations."  <H5>  Quickly Offended </H5>   The German foreign minister often threatens: He wanted to  force the Serbs to their knees; he wanted to break the neck of  the Spanish if they delay the accession of the new members of  the EU. Later denials are ineffective. What emanated the  modest charm of youthful recklessness at the beginning of his  term of office is just embarrassing now.    The man is quickly offended, especially about the press'  scolding of politicians, but also by other countries. He had  the French ambassador summoned to the Foreign Ministry because  of some critical remarks and thus inflated a comment by a  diplomat into a German-French affair. Christian Social Union  [CSU] and Christian Democratic Union [CDU] politicians are  ridiculing the "foreign minister's old fashioned Swabian ways."  SPD Bundestag Group Chairman Klose politely recommended  speaking German and not Swabian at international negotiations  because the dialect is a bit coarse. On top of everything else,  Kinkel yesterday had to apologize in the French newspaper LE  MONDE.    Two years after assuming office, the foreign minister has  largely gambled away his party's most important asset -- namely  the FDP's foreign policy reputation linked with the name of  Genscher. Certainly, Genscher left a lot of unsolved problems to  his successor. However, in contrast to Kinkel, Genscher had  ideas and visions that went beyond the specific day. They were  often indefinite. Genscher loved to keep as many paths as  possible open, to let developments mature and then give them the  final kick. Kinkel, who is a doctor of jurisprudence, on the  other hand, looks for legal positions in the political business.  Where Genscher knew how to implement German interests with as  little noise as possible, Kinkel is loudly calling for a German  seat on the UN Security Council.  <H5>  Quarrel About Rau </H5>   At Whitsun, when the German president will be elected in the  Reichstag building, Kinkel will be facing the next crisis. The  FDP chairman wants to vote for CDU candidate Roman Herzog on the  third ballot. In contrast, the strong North Rhine-Westphalian  FDP wants to vote for Rau. Leading FDP members also expect FDP  candidate Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher to give a restrained  recommendation for Rau. For instance, she could recommend her  electors after the second ballot to make their decision  independent of the yoke of coalition discipline. Thus, she  would speak for Rau.    By voting for Herzog, Kinkel wants to give a signal for the  FDP's reliability as a partner for the CDU/CSU. His opponents  in the party clearly want to stress the party's independence.  The election will give a signal in any case -- that of Kinkel's  weakness as a leader.    The old liberal Gerhart Baum criticizes the FDP for often  lacking inner independence: "In the FDP, there are so-called  coalition liberals, who can only imagine a coalition with the  CDU/CSU." In the inner circle around Kinkel and Bundestag Group  Chairman Solms, the decision has long been on a coalition  statement in favor of the CDU/CSU.    At least, upon Genscher's urging, Kinkel seems to have  decided not to have the coalition statement for the CDU/CSU  adopted at the next party congress in Rostock in June. Genscher  has always been proud of keeping his changing chancellors at  least a bit uncertain. The old fox wants to keep the FDP open as  a partner for both big parties as long as possible. The  honorary FDP chairman was the first one in the party to say that  the CDU/CSU and the chancellor cannot be expected to achieve  much anymore.    However, all that need not bother the party chairman. No  one will replace Kinkel -- not in the election campaign and not  afterwards either, because the fear of a red-green coalition,  which will increase until autumn, will once again drive the FDP  over the 5-percent threshold in the Bundestag. Scharping will  save it. He prefers a coalition with the government-experienced  FDP over a red-green coalition with all its uncertainties.  Business circles are already supporting the FDP in order to  place it at Scharping's side if the SPD wins. Thus, the FDP has  every chance of remaining a government party.  <H5>  Sacrifice </H5>   There is something else, however, that indicates favorable  prospects for the liberals on the political scene. Liberal  values, such as individual responsibility, a turning away from  "Father State," and market economy are gaining weight and are as  undisputed as hardly ever in Germany's past. However, Kinkel is  not the man to seize this opportunity.    Kinkel's problem is that he has not really accepted his new  office. How else could one explain that he still speaks of  having almost concluded a contract with an industrial company in  1990? Why is he not embarrassed when he embellishes his dream  of being a manager with the remark that he would have earned  more money in industry? And, of course, he also has to mention  that his family advised him against politics at that time. So  much talk in this form shows that Klaus Kinkel sees his rise to  the top offices of the republic as a sacrifice. Genscher  enjoyed being a politician.  <H5>  A Bit of Adventurous Spirit </H5>   Kinkel's monomania of leading his party only out of  responsibility -- and not because he enjoys power -- is a  hindrance for him. In this super election year, Kinkel would at  least have to open his party's door a little bit for changing  partners -- as Scheel and Genscher did before him. However, a  change in partners requires courage, imagination, and a bit of  adventurous spirit, as well as a bit of a gambling nature. The  upright Swabian is lacking all that.    "He has gotten used to the jogging pace of government work,"  an FDP insider says. "This provides a special artificial  security removed from the real development. The slogan is:  Everything continues in Bonn's government business. Why should  it not do so after the elections?"</p>

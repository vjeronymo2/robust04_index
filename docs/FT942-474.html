			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Changes to legal training proposed Fundamental changes in education and training for solicitors and barristers in England and Wales have been put forward by the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Committee on Legal Education and Conduct. The committee yesterday published a consultation paper on the initial stages of legal education covering law degrees and conversion courses for non-law graduates. It proposes that a prescribed common element to law degrees should be retained but the emphasis should move away from subjects to be studied, such as contract, tort and crime, to a small number of broad aims, such as understanding the fundamental principles and concepts of English and EC law and an understanding of law's social, economic, political, historic, ethical and cultural context.</p>

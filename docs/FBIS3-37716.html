By way of example, the newspaper mentions the Tajik-Afghan  border, from which disquieting reports come in every day, and  where Russian servicemen get killed.    "But Russian troops do not quit. They just have no right to  leave, for that would mean the death of many thousands of  people... As long as the peoples of various coutnries apply to  Russia for help, Russia still remains a great military power".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on the army's economic problems  and its prestige in society.    In Russia, the defender of the fatherland has always meant  more than just a man with a rifle. But lately the prestige of  the officer and soldirer in the eyes of society is not as high  as one would like it to be. Quite often the army was  undeservedly criticised, the newspaper lamented.    "But the main thing is that however hard the idea of the  defence of the fatherland and its proponents were defamed, they  survived and upheld the thesis that this idea is a sacred notion  and that the defender of the fatherland is the person's social  status", the newspaepr pointed out.    TRUD on the state of affairs in Russia's armed forces.    The newspaper comes to a conclusion that the defenders of  the  fatherland themselves are in need of protection. "Infantry  officers are no longer willing to draw guard duty instead of  soldiers or to shovel coal in garrison stoke-holds.    "Air pilots get sick of waiting for fuel tanker-trucks, not  flying weather. Navy men feel miserable at the quay wall  without long-distance voyages...    "The army now wants one thing -- to be an army: to drive  vehicles, to fire, fly, and navigate the seas, shoot down  training targets, bring up men, and live a decent life, without  the need to think about referenda and the living bread, or  figure in palace coups. The army wants to serve the  fartherland, not politicians".    ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA on the Sarajevo situation and on Russia's  role in easing tension there.    The newspaper points out that it is in many respects due to  Russia's stance that there has been no "Balkan storm" operation.    "Throughout last week, the entire world closely followed the  development of events in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Balkans again  turned into 'europe's powder keg' which could go off with  unpredictable consequences for the old world.    "Nevertheless, the conflict is not yet over. International  diplomacy is yet to make a good deal of effort to undo the tight  knot of Bosnian contradictions.    "The West should draw two lessons from the situation taking  shape there: that the crisis situation in the former Yugoslavia  cannot be resolved behind the back of Russia and in disregard  for her interests. The time has come to abandon the approach  according to which 'it is the Serbs that should pay for  everything', and to place equally tough demands upon all the  sides involved in the Bosnian conflict".    TRUD on the Russian Government's economic reform policy.    The newspaper carries an interview with academician Nikolay  Petrakov, a prominent Russian economist and director of the  academy Institute on Market Studies. The interview dealt with  matters aimed at promoting further economic development of  Russia.    Petrakov said "the market idea has been discredited".  According to him, for two years more than 50 million people in  Russia (who account for more than a third of the country's  population) "live below the subsistence wage", as against 17  million in 1991 when every tenth was in straits whereas now  every third is destitute.    Petrakov believes that it is essential to adjust reforms  "which must be with a human face, using the old Czechoslovak  slogan." with this end in view, the academician suggests in  particular that the taxation system be radically changed and an  in-depth agrarian reform be carried out. "private ownership is  the main principle of the market while the ownership of land is  its foundation," he added.    ROSSIYA newspaper runs an interview with Anatoliy Chubays  who  describes the course of privatisation.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA frontpages a forecast as to which kind  of  report will be delivered by President Boris Yeltsin in the  federal assembly in the Kremlin on Thursday.    The newspaper believes that the president must show that he  is not only prepared "to further and deepen reforms" but is also  aware of the entire "complexity and painfulness of the process"  and point out the achievements of Russian diplomacy "in  resolving the Bosnian crisis".</p>

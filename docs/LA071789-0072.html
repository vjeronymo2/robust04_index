			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NO SURE WINNER LOOMS IN CROWDED 76TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT RACE  </P> <P> Ordinarily, a state legislative candidate who receives only 10% of the  potential vote would not need to concern himself with housing prices in  Sacramento.  </P> <P> However, under the peculiar political mathematics governing next month's  special 76th Assembly District election, attracting the votes of as few as one  in 10 registered voters could insure a landslide victory in the race to select  a successor to the late Bill Bradley (R-Escondido).  </P> <P> Perhaps even more surprising than that unusually low electoral threshold is the  fact that most of the nine candidates in the Aug. 8 campaign doubt that anyone  will surpass it in the sprawling district, which stretches from northeastern  San Diego County to the South Bay, and also includes parts of Riverside County.  </P> <P> "This is one time when there may be more candidates than voters," joked  Democrat Stephen Thorne.  </P> <P> The public's tepid attitude toward the contest obscures the fact that Bradley's  death last month after a nearly four-year battle with cancer created a rare  opportunity for a wide open Assembly race in San Diego County, where most  legislative districts' lopsided partisan voter registration and incumbents'  longevity historically discourage serious competition.  </P> <P> Registration within the 76th District itself is heavily slanted toward  Republicans, 54% to 33% -- a daunting disparity that could leave the  all-but-certain GOP victor with a seat viewed so safe as to be a lifetime job.  </P> <P> Although that tantalizing prospect has piqued uncommonly strong interest among  Bradley's would-be successors, as evidenced by the size of the field, there is  little indication that the public shares that sentiment. Special elections  typically draw low turnouts, a trend likely to be exacerbated in this race by a  mid-summer primary in a district that encompasses desert communities where  daily temperatures often are higher than the number of voters in many  precincts.  </P> <P> Indeed, as the two-month campaign enters its final three weeks, the consensus  of the candidates and their consultants is that next month's turnout probably  will be only about 20%, with some forecasting a turnout percentage as low as  the mid-teens.  </P> <P> To win election outright in the primary, a candidate must receive more than 50%  of the vote -- a figure that, based on the 20% projection, equates to only  about 10% of the district's approximately 240,000 voters.  </P> <P> If no candidate achieves that 50%-plus margin in the primary -- in which all  contenders of all parties will appear on a single ballot -- the top Republican  and Democratic vote-getters would compete in an Oct. 3 runoff. (Ten candidates  have qualified for the primary, but one -- Republican Lori Holt Pfeiler --  withdrew last week and endorsed fellow Republican Tricia Hunter. Pfeiler's  name, however, remains on the ballot.)  </P> <P> The campaign's unusual format, combined with its brevity and large field, has  complicated the candidates' efforts to devise an effective strategy for  reaching voters from Bonita to Palomar and Jacumba to Palm Desert in a shorter  time than candidates usually take to decide whether to run.  </P> <P> "In terms of the time span, the circumstances, the number of candidates and  everything else, this is a once-in-a-lifetime campaign," said Republican Poway  City Councilwoman Linda Brannon, one of seven GOP candidates in the race. "Just  about everything about it is unique."  </P> <P> "This is a blink-your-eye-and-it's-over kind of campaign," added Glenn  Richardson, another GOP candidate.  </P> <P> Despite its short duration, the campaign likely will end up being more  expensive than most full-length Assembly contests -- again, largely because of  the rarity of an "open" seat race. With three major candidates planning to  spend at least $150,000 each, the price tag for the primary alone is expected  to approach $1 million.  </P> <P> Recognizing the numerical possibilities of an exceptionally low turnout being  splintered among nine people, the candidates and their strategists acknowledge  that even seemingly minor first-time candidates could play a pivotal role in  next month's primary. By siphoning off critical votes from the front runners,  the long shots could scramble the vote breakdowns, conceivably allowing one of  the lesser-known candidates to slip into the runoff.  </P> <P> That potential is of gravest concern to the three candidates who appear to be  running the most well-rounded, well-funded campaigns: Brannon, Poway  businessman Dick Lyles and Bonita nurse Tricia Hunter. Each has assembled a  sizable grass roots organization, is well on the way to a six-figure campaign  budget, appears polished in front of campaign audiences and can point to  significant backing and endorsements.  </P> <P> A second tier of strong challengers, each of whom hopes to spend about  $100,000, includes San Diego Police Lt. Bill Hoover of Escondido, state Senate  legislative aide Dennis Koolhaas of Escondido and Richardson, a former  television commentator from Rancho.  </P> <P> The district's demographics alone appear to diminish the chances of the two  Democrats in the race -- Jeannine Correia, an instructor of the retarded from  Poway, and mental health worker Stephen Thorne of Escondido. Meanwhile, retired  appliance-store owner Ray Foster of Spring Valley summed up the long odds that  he confronts in his low-budget campaign this way: "I'm out to answer the  question: 'Can a guy make his initial political run after age 65 and be  successful?' "  </P> <P> In this case, the answer appears to be: Not likely.  </P> <P> However, as Correia points out, because of the peculiar nature of the 76th  District contest, "no one can be automatically counted out." As a result, most  of the candidates are able to offer winning scenarios that, while still  implausible, cannot be dismissed quite as lightly as they normally would be.  </P> <P> The Democrats' admittedly slim chances, for example, hinge on hopes that a  solid Democratic turnout could swamp a light, splintered GOP vote. Other  candidates talk of attracting specific blocs of voters while their opponents  neutralize each other. Republicans and Democrats alike are placing a strong  emphasis on absentee ballots, viewing that as a surer source of votes than  Election Day polling places.  </P> <P> Similarly, as the only Riverside County candidate in the race, Richardson is  particularly intrigued by the race's potential arithmetic possibilities.  </P> <P> "San Diego has (about 70%) of the vote and eight candidates, and Riverside has  (30%) and one candidate," Richardson noted. "Interesting math. Very interesting  math."  </P> <P> Candidates' biographies.

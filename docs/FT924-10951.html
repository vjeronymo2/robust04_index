			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Greenalls gets swift nod on Pounds 86m issue - A change in strategy for the Lancashire group GREENALLS' Pounds 86m cash call has been given a quick nod of approval by the City. Analysts, after all, have had plenty of time to mull over the pros and cons of a rights issue by the Lancashire-based pubs and hotels group. The move was clearly signalled 10 months ago when the group reorganised its two-tier share structure, ending 230 years of Greenall family control. The restructuring - which left the family with a 16 per cent stake - marked the end of the company's transition from regional brewer to national retailer. The 1989 report of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on the brewing industry was the catalyst for Greenalls' switch in business strategy. With the beer market in slow decline and increasingly dominated by national lager brands, it became clear that the post-MMC environment would offer much better growth prospects for the group as a pubs operator. Its record as a brewer had been sound. Between 1970 and 1990, the group achieved a real compound growth rate of 6 per cent a year in earnings per share and 8 per cent a year in shareholders funds. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 3m in 1970 to Pounds 62m in 1990. But the management, including the founding family's Peter Greenall, now managing director, decided that resources should be focused on its retail estate in which it believed it had a sustainable competitive edge. History was swiftly consigned to the dustbin. The breweries at Warrington and Nottingham were closed in 1990. Closure costs of Pounds 48m were partially offset by the Pounds 26m sale of Greenalls' share in Vladivar vodka - the 'wodka from Warrington.' The breweries had been operating 40 per cent below capacity. A brewing contract with Allied-Lyons enabled Greenalls to get its beer brands supplied more cheaply while shopping around for a selection of best-selling lagers and bitters. A restructured group focused on four business areas: its estate of 1,400 pubs; 110 Premier House inns providing branded food and accommodation; De Vere hotels, including the Belfry, venue for golf's Ryder Cup; and drinks and leisure services which encompassed the biggest off-licence chain in the north of England. Reform of the share structure earlier this year was the signal for a prudent and pragmatic expansion along the entire front. Easier access to the market for development finance was a necessity for the business. Mr Andrew Thomas, chairman and chief executive, said at the time: 'It is important that the company has maximum flexibility in terms of access to financial markets in order to respond rapidly to opportunities for investing in existing business areas as they arise.' The deepening recession, according to Mr Thomas, is now creating opportunities 'to acquire quality assets at low prices on which we believe we can earn attractive rates of return.' The City had expected the rights issue to be linked to a specific acquisition. But Mr David Thompson, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, says: 'We think this new emphasis - on piecemeal add-on acquisitions - is less risky. It stresses the intention to ensure an adequate return on investment, to be choosy, and not to commit large sums of money in one throw.' Greenalls' balance sheet will be bolstered by the Pounds 86m it will raise from issuing nearly 30m shares at the discounted price of 295p. Gearing will fall from 27.5 per cent to 14.5 per cent, with interest cover rising to 6. The cash inflow will neatly match the amount spent during the past year on investments in group operations; investments which set the cautious tone of its expansion during a time of difficult trading and flat profits. About Pounds 30m has been spent on upgrading the group's 1,400 pubs which last year contributed Pounds 44.8m, 60 per cent of total operating profits. Forty pubs at the tail end of the estate were sold for Pounds 6m; and 39 hand-picked outlets in the northern home counties were acquired for Pounds 10m from Allied-Lyons. Spending on the group's catering inns, which reported operating profits last year of Pounds 6.4m, amounted to Pounds 16m. By adding facilities such as restaurants, children's play areas and budget accommodation, the company claims it can increase the return on investment by 6 percentage points. Greenalls' expanded its off-licence chain during the year to 500 outlets - the fourth largest in the country - with the Pounds 20m acquisition of 187 Blayneys stores from Vaux. De Vere hotels picked up a bargain earlier this month when it bought the Belton Woods hotel and golf complex at Grantham from the receiver for Pounds 10.3m - about half its development cost. A new hotel was opened at Swindon this year and two more will be built in the next two years. But its US hotels lost Pounds 665,000 last year, and will be sold as soon as possible. Of all Greenalls' ambitions, it is its aim to turn De Vere into one of the country's leading luxury hotel chains that raises most quizzical eyebrows.</p>

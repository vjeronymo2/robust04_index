			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Producers to discuss rubber pact The world's main rubber producing nations will meet in Thailand next month to discuss their negotiating strategy for a new global price stabilisation pact, an official from a rubber producers council said here yesterday, reports Reuters from Kuala Lumpur. Mr Sucharit Promdej, secretary-general of the Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries said the meeting would be held in Hatyai on September 23 and 24. 'We will have a round of informal talks there before we go to Geneva for the second round of negotiations for a new agreement,' he said after the ANRPC met. Major rubber producing and consuming nations are to meet in Geneva from October 3-14 to negotiate the third International Natural Rubber Agreement. Producers and consumers remain at odds over the benchmark prices for rubber, with producers saying they are too low and consumers saying they are just right. The ANRPC groups India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Thailand, which between them control about 80 per cent of the world's supply. It met in Kuala Lumpur to discuss decisions taken by a special executive session of the International Natural Rubber Organisation on Monday. The Inro council decided to continue selling rubber from its stockpile in a so far vain attempt to pull down prices from six-year highs. Mr Sucharit said the informal round in Hatyai would focus on demands by producers for higher reference prices for rubber, which have remained basically unchanged since the first rubber pact was agreed in 1979.</p>

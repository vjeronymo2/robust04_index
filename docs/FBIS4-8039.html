			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by R.W.: "According to CBOS Respondents: </F> Kwasniewski for President"]    [Text] A year and a half before presidential elections,  Aleksander Kwasniewski [chairman of the Social Democracy of the  Polish Republic] is the best candidate for next president of  Poland. The Public Opinion Research Center [CBOS] conducted a  survey at the end of March using a list of politicians, and  Kwasniewski gained the highest support (17 percent). His  "presidential popularity" has not changed since January. But  there are clearly far fewer people (compared with the beginning  of the year) who would be willing to support Lech Walesa or  Krzysztof Skubiszewski in the race for the Belweder (or, as the  case may be, to Namiestnikowski Palace). Apart from Kwasniewski,  only [Prime Minister] Waldemar Pawlak managed to gain the  "votes" of at least one in 10 prospective voters, during the  March poll. Support for Zbigniew Religa, chief of the Non-Party  Bloc in Support of Reforms, increased slightly since January;  Religa now occupies third place on the list of presidential  candidates. Respondents' views continue to be very diversified.  Therefore, no one from among the personalities named by CBOS can  regard himself as a definite favorite on the basis of the poll  only. It is worth stressing that just 2 percent of respondents  say Jacek Kuron, who leads in popularity polls, would make a  good future president. No politician of the center right enjoys  significant support. Respondents do not have anyone "in  reserve," either. Just 7 percent of respondents said they would  vote for somebody who is not on the CBOS list. The CBOS poll  was conducted on 25-28 March (1,230-person representative random  sample of the country's adult population) and 27-31 January  (1,172-person sample).</p>

			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> The National Stuttering Project, the group that launched protests after "A Fish  Called Wanda" was released, demanded an apology Thursday from actor Kevin Kline  over remarks he made the previous evening upon winning the best supporting  actor Oscar for his role in the film. "Wanda" features British comedian Michael  Palin as a stutterer. When asked by reporters about the protests, Kline  responded, "John Cleese (the film's co-author and star) mentioned to me today  he was getting a lot of calls from a group of stupid people who didn't like the  way stupid people were represented. . . ." Kline defended Palin's portrayal and  noted that Palin's father stuttered in real life. "Michael Palin had no qualms  that I know of about representing that and I think he did it brilliantly,"  Kline said. "A lot of times it's funny, what comes out of them. . . . We have  to laugh at tragic things if they're seen in a certain perspective. Let's not  lose our sense of irony." John Ahlbach, executive director of the National  Stuttering Project, said, "We were not saying that stuttering could not be  laughed at. Humor must play a part in coping with any chronic disorder like  stuttering. However, we feel the movie reinforces a stereotype of people who  stutter, and therefore invites the audience to laugh at people who stutter and  not with us." Ahlbach acknowledged that Kline "made his remarks in haste and  perhaps did not mean all that was implied in his joke." AILEEN MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] No plot exists, allegedly by two Pakistanis, to  assassinate or otherwise harm the Nepalese crown prince, Police  director-general Pratin Santipraphop said yesterday.    He said there was a misunderstanding that Shakil Ammad, who  is in police custody, and Mohammad Javet, who initially eluded  police, had plotted to harm Crown Prince Dipendra bin Brikram  Shadey at the Asian Institute of Technology [AIT].    Officers in charge of the case were told the two were  engineers with a company in Thailand, he said.    The two men went to the institute to use its telephone to  make an overseas call instead of making the call at their hotel  which would charge them more, Pol Gen [police general] Pratin  said.    When officials at the AIT asked to see their passports, the  pair could not produce them because they had forgotten to bring  them. They then escaped because they were afraid they would be  questioned, he said.    The Nepalese Embassy has also denied the plot suggestion.    The crown prince attended a geography course at the  institute. He begins his official visit to Thailand today and  leaves on Monday.    In a related development, Pakistan on Wednesday branded  allegations that two Pakistanis planned to attack Nepal's Crown  Prince Dipendra during his visit to Bangkok, a "smear campaign,"  intended to sabotage Pakistan-Nepal relations.    "This has become a very serious smear campaign," Riaz  Mahmud,  Pakistan's Ambassador to Thailand, told AFP. "Definitely there  was a motive of some kind involved."    Ambassador Mahmud said he believed that Thai police who were  quoted in the BANGKOK POST on Tuesday as saying there had been  "hard evidence" linking two men to a plot -- had been used by an  "outside agency."    Pakistan and Nepal "are very close members in SARG (South  Asian Regional Cooperation)," he said. "That may not be to  everyone's liking," he said.    He told AFP the embassy was questioning both Special Branch  officials and POST employees over the matter, adding: "We should  have some answers in a few days."    Earlier on Wednesday, Kathmandu called the allegations  "totally baseless and false."    Both Ammad and Javet have denied any wrongdoing.  sed on Wednesday to comment by phone on the case.    The POST report which appeared in Tuesday's edition was  based  on an authoritative Special Branch report. Police have since  reconfirmed that their investigations are continuing.</p>

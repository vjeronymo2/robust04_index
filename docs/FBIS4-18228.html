			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Torsten Knoedler report: "Minister Rexrodt and the End of </F> the Debate"]    [Text] Bonn -- After the heavy election defeat of the  liberals in Lower Saxony, Honorary Chairman Hans-Dietrich  Genscher claimed the floor in the Free Democratic Party [FDP]  Presidium: Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt does not show  enough liberal profile, the FDP elder asserted.    FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel does not completely agree either  with the way in which Rexrodt is fulfilling his role: The man  regards himself too much as a minister of the FRG Government and  too little as an FDP politician, he said.    Bad words for Rexrodt come from the coalition partner. In  Norbert Bluem's Labor Ministry it is stated: "A lightweight who  does not work things out properly before he takes them to the  outside." Behind his hand, a liberal party friend referred to  the minister as follows: "A big mouth who does not get anything  done." Rexrodt gives in too frequently to the chancellor and the  Christian Democratic Union [CDU], it is stated in the FDP  Presidium.    -- Pensions example: Rexrodt announced in the news magazine  FOCUS in late 1993: "Pensions will definitely not be safe as of  2010." The economics minister recommended increasing the  working life span and thinking about the pension system  structure. Kohl: "Pensions are taboo." End of debate.    -- Health policy example: In the paper "Securing the future  of Germany as an economic location," Rexrodt demanded in August  1993 that, in the future, patients pay for their medicine in  pharmacies themselves. The money will be later refunded to them  by the sick fund. Seehofer (Christian Social Union -- CSU) said  no. End of debate.    -- Coal subsidies example: Rexrodt announced in October  1993: "In the long run, we can no longer afford to spend 7  billion German marks [DM] on German power production from German  hard coal every year." After miner protests in the Ruhr area,  Rexrodt gave in to the coalition round. Annual financial  assistance of DM7 billion for the German mines from 1997 to 2000  was resolved. End of debate.    -- Shop closing times example: The liberal economics  minister said: "The law regulating the closing time of shops is  deadwood." In addition to the FDP, CDU Secretary General Peter  Hintze, segments of the CDU/CSU Bundestag Group, Defense  Minister Volker Ruehe (CDU) supported him. However, Helmut Kohl  rejected it and the retail trade and trade unions protested.  End of debate.    -- The law governing discounts example: The economics  minister put this basic element of liberal pricing on the  Cabinet agenda. But Kohl simply removed it again. End of debate.    The criticism vented on Rexrodt finally even startled the  party leadership. With a view to European elections in June,  which are particularly problematic for the FDP, nobody wants to  repeat the deliberately spread criticisms of the Presidium.    Yesterday the following was said in the Thomas Dehler House:  "Rexrodt? He becomes better day by day!"</p>

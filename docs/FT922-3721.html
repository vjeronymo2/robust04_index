			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Management: Top bosses find change is as good as a pest - Senior executives are becoming resistant to altering the way they work Resistance from middle managers is usually considered the biggest obstacle to the sort of organisational and culture change which most western companies are trying to implement. Yet in Britain, resistance to change among senior executives is soaring to such an extent that top managers now claim it is becoming almost as serious a barrier. Not only that, but top managers say that resistance from their own board colleagues, albeit less intense than from middle or senior managers, has become a greater problem than opposition from junior managers or even from trade unions. Some organisations are now suffering from a 'siege' mentality among their managers. These are the findings of a survey about Managing Change in the 1990s* among 475 top and senior executives in 364 large British organisations, in both the private and public sectors. As the second survey of its kind in two years by the same consultancy, People In Business, the results provide a useful gauge of the changing temperature at various organisational levels. The survey is not an objective test, since it measures the perceptions of top managers - 91 per cent of the sample were directors. But it does shed light on how managerial attitudes tend to shift, both as change programmes get under way for the first time - as in many public sector organisations at present - and as executives start to be more affected by established change programmes than they had expected. The study does not demonstrate conclusively whether changes in resistance are associated directly with job insecurity, but its authors say that part of the increased resistance is from managers whose departments are under threat. In terms of strict ranking, resistance from middle managers is still seen as Obstacle No 1 by the survey's respondents: it was cited by 22 per cent, the same as in 1990. This constitutes a serious problem. As the study says, recalcitrant middle managers act as a 'refractive layer', 'blocking, distorting or bending communication about change'. Instead of being labelled by their organisations as 'villains', these managers need to be integrated with the change process and made comfortable with it, the study argues. They must be 'given' the skills to handle their new roles as change leaders, rather than being left to flounder. If this is true of middle managers, it applies even more to the executives above them. Yet the new survey suggests that such managers are themselves fast becoming 'a second refractive layer'. It ranks resistance from senior managers (one or two levels below the board) as Obstacle No 2; opposition from them was cited by 18 per cent of respondents, up from only 12 per cent in 1990. Resistance from top management, at 11 per cent (up from 8 per cent) has overtaken resistance from trade unions, at 10 per cent (down from 12 per cent). Perceived resistance from junior managers is up slightly,from 6 to 8 per cent, while opposition from lower-ranked staff employees is down from 9 to 7 per cent. When the responses are broken down between the private and public sectors, the implications of the survey become even more intriguing. The perceived surge in resistance among senior managers stemmed entirely from the private sector (where it was cited by 20 per cent of respondents, up from 13 per cent in 1990), with the public sector perception of it stable at 8 per cent. Yet the surge in reported 'top' management resistance was entirely in the public sector (up from nil to 11 per cent), with private sector perception of it stable at the previous survey's level of 11 per cent. Paul Lloyd, one of the study's authors, says the odd-looking public sector figures may be explicable in terms of time lapse. Most public sector organisations are at an earlier stage in the management change process than the private sector, he says. As a result, top management resistance is only now catching up with private sector levels. As for the relative lack of resistance below board level, Lloyd suggest that this is either because change has not yet become an issue between top managers and those immediately beneath them, or because there is a greater sense of fear in the public sector, so that senior managers 'will jump when told to'. *Pounds 55.

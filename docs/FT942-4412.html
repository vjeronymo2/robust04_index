			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / World Trade News: US studies Tokyo development aid The US is targeting Japanese overseas development aid as another channel for increasing US exports, according to a top US trade official. In a break from conventional US trade policy, the Commerce Department is 'looking into how US firms can get a larger share of (Japan's aid) financing', Mr Jeffrey Garten, under-secretary of commerce for international trade, said yesterday. Japanese overseas development aid, much of which goes into infrastructure investment, amounts to about Dollars 10bn a year, he said. Of that, Japanese companies win about 30 per cent of contracts while US companies were receiving only about 5 per cent, according to Commerce Department estimates. 'We have to take another look at who is receiving what,' Mr Garten noted. While no target is being discussed for the US share of Japan's ODA allocation, Mr Garten went on to say that 'we think there is great room for US firms to expand their share'. He also underlined that Japanese aid was untied and that the task facing US authorities was to spread information on Japanese ODA among US companies and on how to go about winning contracts. 'Many, many US firms don't even know of the existence of this money,' Mr Garten said. Competition to win contracts involving Japanese aid would most certainly intensify, particularly from Europe. Separately, Mr Garten also emphasised US interest in increasing exports to Japan in the field of information technology, where the US has a leading edge.</p>

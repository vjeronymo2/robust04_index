			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Observer: Lowry collected There will be a sigh of relief at London's Tate Gallery that New York's Museum of Modern Art has finally found a new director - Glenn Lowry, the 40-year-old director of the Art Gallery of Ontario. It would have been a big blow for the Tate if the Americans had poached Nicholas Serota, its ambitious director. Finding a replacement for Richard Oldenburg, who has been Moma's director for the past 22 years, has not been easy. It is well over a year since the New Yorkers started searching and Lowry, an expert in Islamic and Oriental art, is not the most obvious choice to run a gallery specialising in modern art. His appointment is another sign of the developing world shortage in good international museum directors. Finding a top scholar who can turn a hand equally well to administering and fund-raising is becoming even more tricky than landing a rare collection these days.</p>

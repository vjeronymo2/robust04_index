			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Fabian call for overhaul of regulation THE SYSTEM for regulating utilities should be radically overhauled, with commissions introduced to hold open hearings on the utilities' plans, according to a Fabian Society paper published today. The society, a left-of-centre think tank, argues that US-style regulatory commissions should be created to oversee the water, gas and electricity industries. At the open hearings consumers and other interested parties could give evidence. The commissions would be much more open than the current regulatory offices Ofwat, Ofgas and Offer. The study, by Professor Michael Waterson of Reading University, argues that commissions holding open hearings would be more appropriate for water, gas and electricity because there are limited prospects for introducing competition there. He argues that forms of regulation should be tailored to the characteristics of the industries concerned, however. So in industries such as telecommunications, where technological change is opening opportunities for competition, the current body, Oftel, is perfectly adequate. Prof Waterson acknowledges that public commissions can be much more expensive than regulatory offices. He says the latter system might be usefully extended to organisations such as the Post Office and British Rail, which are becoming more commercial.

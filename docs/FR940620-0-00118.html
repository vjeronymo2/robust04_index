			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This provision does not require that jails or prisons provide medical care units. Thus, detention and correctional facilities not containing the type of medical care facilities addressed by ADAAG 6 would not be subject to this provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ADAAG 6.1 requires that in general purpose hospitals, psychiatric facilities, and detoxification facilities, at least 10 percent of patient bedrooms shall be accessible. Several comments, including those from the Illinois Department of Corrections, considered this scoping excessive for medical care facilities in detention and correctional facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The minimum number of accessible patient bedrooms required in ADAAG 6.1 recognizes that the incidence of disability, either permanent or temporary, is greater in medical care facilities. While information and survey data received in this rulemaking suggests that the prevalence of disability is lower among the inmate population than the general population, none was received indicating that the incidence of disability is lower in detention or correctional medical care facilities. In fact, in view of certain existing policies of housing inmates with disabilities in infirmaries, it may be greater. Consequently, the reference to ADAAG 6.1, which includes the 10 percent scoping requirement for patient bedrooms, has been retained. One corrections official stated that the scoping requirements of ADAAG 6.1 are ``an affirmation of good architectural practice.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ADAAG 6.2 addresses entrances to medical care facilities and requires that at least one accessible entrance ``be protected from the weather by canopy or roof overhang.'' In addition, this provision requires that such entrances also be served by an accessible passenger loading zone. One State correctional agency indicated that canopy or roof overhangs may compromise security by obstructing surveillance. This commenter further recommended an exception for required clear floor space alongside beds in existing facilities and an exception allowing the location of toilet and bathing facilities within patient cells instead of separate toilet or bathrooms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This provision has been revised to reference all sections of ADAAG 6 (Medical Care Facilities) except ADAAG 6.2, which requires canopy or roof overhangs. An exception has not been provided for clear floor space alongside beds in existing facilities since these guidelines pertain only to new construction and alterations. In the case of an alteration, the necessary clear floor space required in ADAAG 6.3 would be required only to the extent technically feasible. Regarding the requirement in ADAAG 6.4 for accessible patient toilet rooms and bathrooms, the references to ADAAG 4.22 (Toilet Rooms) and ADAAG 4.23 (Bathrooms, Bathing Facilities, and Shower Rooms) do not preclude placement of toilet or bathing fixtures within patient cells or rooms as long as the requirements for toilet rooms and bathrooms, including maneuvering space, are met. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Special holding or housing cells required to be accessible by ADAAG 12.4.2 may include those used for purposes of medical isolation. Since cells used for this purpose may be located within medical care facilities, the NPRM asked whether they should be counted as part of, or in addition to, the number of patient bedrooms or cells required to accessible under ADAAG 6. A majority of the responses to this question felt that medical isolation cells should be accessible in addition to the percentage of patient bedrooms or cells required to be accessible by ADAAG 6. In fact, several comments from corrections officials indicated that all medical isolation cells should be accessible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In view of the response to this question, language has been added to the provision and the appendix clarifying that medical isolation cells required to be accessible by ADAAG 12.4.2 shall not be counted as part of the minimum number of patient bedrooms or cells required to be accessible under ADAAG 6.1. Thus, if a medical care facility has both types of cells, at least one medical isolation cell must be accessible under ADAAG 12.4.2 in addition to the number of patient bedrooms or cells, in most cases 10 percent, required to be accessible by ADAAG 6.1. Consistent with the requirement for special purpose cells in ADAAG 12.4.2, at least one medical isolation cell per facility is required to be accessible. However, in view of the opinion expressed by some prison operators, it is recommended that consideration be given to ensuring the accessibility of all medical isolation cells. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 12.4.5&blank;Alterations to Cells or Rooms <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ADAAG 4.1.6 requires that if existing spaces or elements are altered, then each such altered element or space shall be made accessible. ADAAG 12.4.5 clarifies that the percentage of cells that must be made accessible as part of an alteration is based on the total number of cells altered and not on the total number of cells in the facility. This would apply to all subsequent alterations until such time as the minimum percentage required in new construction for the facility overall is met. The three percent figure is consistent with the minimum percentage specified for new construction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Similar to a concern raised with respect to new construction, some State correctional agencies requested that the guidelines be flexible in requiring accessible cells or rooms as part of an alteration. Some correctional systems contain prisons that under current policies or assignment procedures are not intended to house persons with disabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The concern raised by corrections officials is understandable in light of current policies, but the underlying rationale involves operational considerations, such as inmate placement and assignment procedures, that lie beyond the Board's purview. As noted previously, the Board's statutory mandate requires a minimum level of accessibility in alterations and new construction. Operators of correctional systems may question the practicality of making cells accessible as part of an alteration at certain facilities not intended to house inmates with disabilities. However, the ADA and its legislative history recognize alterations as opportunities for providing access. Such opportunities are to be taken even in situations where the altered element or space may not be made fully accessible to or usable by persons with disabilities. Further, additional alterations may eventually lead to full accessibility of an existing facility, and, with respect to correctional systems, assignment policies may change. Such policies are subject to review by the Department of Justice under title II of the ADA which prohibits discriminatory policies, practices, and procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In discussing requirements for accessible cells, various commenters expressed concern about compliance in cases of alteration. For example, requirements for toilet and bathing facilities include specifications for grab bars. Commenters indicated that grab bars may be properly mounted and secured to the degree necessary in new construction but not necessarily as part of an alteration. In fact, one commenter noted that the proper securement of grab bars in prison cells may actually necessitate reconstruction of cell walls. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / White House press chief keeps her job: Clinton overrules plan to replace Dee Dee Myers President Bill Clinton has overruled his chief of staff's recommendation to replace Ms Dee Dee Myers as White House press secretary. A personal appeal from Ms Myers to the president on Thursday evening appears to have been instrumental in his decision. Mr Leon Panetta, the chief of staff, announced an extensive reshuffling of duties in the White House yesterday afternoon, designed, he said, 'to establish clear lines of authority'. He added that 'good judgment' had not always been exercised in the past, a reference to a number of embarrassing controversies ranging from the travel office to Whitewater-related matters. Two of Mr Clinton's closest aides, both previously with virtually unimpeded access to the Oval Office, are given more specified duties. Mr George Stephanopoulos is to be executive assistant for policy in Mr Panetta's office, while Mr Bruce Lindsey moves to become a deputy White House legal counsel. Mr Harold Ickes also gains more power as deputy chief of staff for policy and political affairs. But the immediate impact of his changes was diluted by the resolution of Ms Myers's status. Although Mr Panetta said it was 'not true' he wanted someone else as press secretary, there seems little doubt that Mr Clinton did overrule the former congressman and budget director. His plan, widely circulated in the capital on Thursday, would have had Ms Myers replaced as press secretary by Mr Mike McCurry, currently the state department's chief spokesman. She would have been given unspecified broader responsibilities in the White House communications network. This prompted Ms Myers to appeal directly to Mr Clinton in what was described as an 'emotional' session in which she may have threatened to resign. Mr Clinton, not unaccustomed to making up his mind at the last minute, decided not only to retain her as press secretary but to give her greater access to senior policy-makers, including himself. Ms Myers is the first female press secretary and one of the most visible women on the team. Her departure under protest would not have looked good, especially since Mr Panetta's reshuffle also involved two other senior female staff members. Ms Joan Baggett remains political director but must now report to Mr Ickes, while Ms Ricki Seidman, in charge of presidential scheduling, is leaving the government.</p>

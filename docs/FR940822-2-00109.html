General Description  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Institute is interested in funding both innovative programs and programs of proven merit that can be replicated in other jurisdictions. Although applications in any of the statutory program areas are eligible for funding in FY 1995, the Institute is especially interested in funding those projects that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Formulate new procedures and techniques, or creatively enhance existing arrangements to improve the courts;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Address aspects of the State judicial systems that are in special need of serious attention;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Have national significance in terms of their impact or replicability in that they develop products, services and techniques that may be used in other States; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Create and disseminate products that effectively transfer the information and ideas developed to relevant audiences in State and local judicial systems or provide technical assistance to facilitate the adaptation of effective programs and procedures in other State and local jurisdictions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A project will be identified as a ``Special Interest'' project if it meets the four criteria set forth above and (1) it falls within the scope of the ``special interest'' program areas designated below, or (2) information coming to the attention of the Institute from the State courts, their affiliated organizations, the research literature, or other sources demonstrates that the project responds to another special need or interest of the State courts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concept papers and applications which address a ``Special Interest'' category will be accorded a preference in the rating process. (See the selection criteria listed in sections VI.B., ``Concept Paper Submission Requirements for New Projects,'' and VIII.B., ``Application Review Procedures.'')  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

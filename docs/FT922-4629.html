			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Nafta deal likely soon, says Salinas PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico says the North American free trade agreement (Nafta) talks could be over within weeks, and he sees no big stumbling block to reaching an accord. He said in an interview that serious issues remained to be resolved, including rules of origin that determine the minimum amount of regional content for goods to be eligible for free trade, tariff reductions, rules governing foreign investment, and agriculture. 'Some (of these issues) are practically over,' he added. 'Some require additional steps.' The president made a plea for European investment, suggesting that 'those who invest in Mexico will have a better chance to participate in this huge regional market'. Mr Salinas, who will visit the UK, France, Spain and Hungary in July, added: 'We would like to have a strong commercial agreement with the European Community' within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The president hinted at his, and no doubt US President George Bush's, likely pitch in selling the agreement to US Congressmen and voters. 'I want to export goods, not people; therefore with the agreement we would like to create more employment opportunities and reduce migration into the US.' Above all, 'we want the capacity to compete with Europe and the Asian pacific countries, not as a closed fortress but as an open region in accord with Gatt regulations'. Mr Salinas called for a reform of the United Nations, urging that more power be given to the General Assembly and that the veto power of the five permanent members of the Security Council be 're-thought'. Warming to this theme, he suggested 'it was not easy to have a neighbour in the US'. Mexico's improvement of ties with Washington was a 'strategic decision'. A better relationship with the US meant Mexico would be in a better position to compete with other regions in the world.</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Rebellion crushed by Gadaffi, diplomats say: Evidence points to uprising by Libyan military COLONEL Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader, last week violently put down what appears to have been a concerted rebellion by parts of his armed forces, according to Arab and western diplomats. They described the unrest as the most serious in Libya for at least seven years. Details of the uprising remain patchy, but diplomats quoting 'reliable sources' in Libya say military units in as many as five centres staged a violent rebellion early last week, which seems to have been crushed with the help of the Libyan air force. Libyan officials, who habitually suppress sensitive information, denied any such unrest. But diplomats say there is evidence of sizeable uprisings on October 11-14 at military installations at Misratah, Tarhua, Ghariyiah, Beni Walid and Brak - towns to the south and west of the capital, Tripoli. They reported explosions at military depots, airforce bombing of roads, and witnesses seeing numerous casualties in several hospitals. Several diplomats said the violence appeared the worst since clashes between the army and dissident factions in 1986, after the US bombing of Tripoli. The diplomats spoke of a subsequent purge of senior officers within the Libyan military. 'We understand people in the government were quite rattled  -several old military hands appear to have taken part,' said one diplomat. Others said members of Col Gadaffi's security escort had been among the casualties. The reports converge with earlier claims by the National Front for the Salvation of Libya, the exiled opposition group, claiming a simultaneous uprising took place last week involving up to 2,000 mutinous troops at Misratah alone in what they claimed was an attempted coup d'etat. The reports are also circumstantially supported by a speech given by Col Gaddafi in Misratah on October 17, in which he condemned 'treachery' against the regime at some length, and said in reference to those who 'betrayed' Libya to the Italian colonisers, that: 'The traitors of October 1911 are like the traitors of October 1993' and should be 'eliminated'. He made no direct allusion to any uprising. The cause of the unrest is also unclear, although most diplomats and other analysts suggested it may have arisen indirectly out of the international pressure on Libya over its alleged role in the 1988 bombing of a PanAm aircraft over Lockerbie in Scotland. They said deep internal divisions over whether to extradite two Libyan secret service agents accused by the US and Britain over the Lockerbie bombing have aggravated intra-tribal rivalry in the country.</p>

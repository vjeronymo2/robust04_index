			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Major stresses S African free trade Mr John Major, the British prime minister, yesterday warned South Africa not to allow demands for a rapid improvement in black living standards to block free market economic reforms. In a wide-ranging address to parliament, Mr Major urged President Nelson Mandela's government of national unity to embrace free market policies that would create jobs and prosperity by attracting 'hard headed investors'. He said business confidence, the key to meeting high expectations, could only be maintained through policies encouraging private initiative and competition, and discouraging bureaucratic meddling: 'Your people are impatient for results. Yet no government on earth, however benevolent, can develop an economy with strokes of the pen.' UK officials said the prime minister's message, which was repeated in talks with Mr Thabo Mbeki and Mr FW de Klerk, deputy presidents, was intended to bolster free market sympathisers within the African National Congress-dominated government. British ministers have been encouraged by the government's gradual acceptance of the need to privatise part of the state-owned economy to finance its ambitious redevelopment proposals, which will be outlined in a white paper today Mr Chris Liebenberg, finance minister, said earlier this week that government discussions on privatisation were 'progressing very nicely'. Mr Major gave details of a Pounds 1.25bn assistance package for South Africa, announced in July, which is described by British officials as the biggest offered by any country since the elections. The package includes Pounds 100m in aid, partly delivered through the Commonwealth and the European Union, Pounds 1bn in export credit guarantees, and measures to help education, health, sport and small businesses.</p>

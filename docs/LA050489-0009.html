			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MOTHER GRANTED CUSTODY OF BOY BY SWEDISH COURT  </P> <P> A Swedish court Wednesday ordered that custody of a 3-year-old Tustin boy be  returned to his mother, ending a saga that began about 7 weeks ago when the  father fled to Sweden with the boy after staging a boating accident to fake  their deaths.  </P> <P> Marci Steele, who was reunited with 3-year-old Schyler Steele when she arrived  in Sweden on Sunday, is scheduled to return home with him tonight, said her  father, Pete Helsley.  </P> <P> "She's happy that it's over with," said Helsley, who spoke to his daughter  Wednesday morning, "but she sounded absolutely exhausted. I don't think she's  had any sleep since she's been over there."  </P> <P> Scott Steele, the boy's father, remains in a Swedish jail pending extradition  by U.S. officials. Steele is the object of an investigation by Riverside and  Orange county authorities into allegations of grand theft, forgery and bad  checks.  </P> <P> In an interview from jail, Steele said he will fight extradition, and he  criticized the Swedish court's custody decision.  </P> <P> "I didn't think it was fair at all," Steele said. The court "should not have  made a decision today, and they should have had a doctor look at Schyler for  psychological tests."  </P> <P> Steele, 32, who maintains he is innocent of criminal activities, said he has  hired a Swedish attorney to replace the one appointed for him. Rod Perkins, an  investigator in the Riverside County district attorney's office, said Steele  can fight extradition at a hearing before Swedish authorities. Perkins said he  did not know when the hearing would take place.  </P> <P> After the criminal matters are resolved, Steele said, he will return to the  United States and appeal for custody of Schyler.  </P> <P> The Steele family drama began March 11, when Steele and Schyler were  vacationing on Santa Catalina Island. Steele's girlfriend, Susanne Pettersson  -- a former nanny for the Steeles -- made a frantic call to authorities to  report that father and son had not returned from an outing in an inflatable  boat.  </P> <P> Coast Guard authorities combed the area, unaware that Steele and the boy were  en route to Europe. The pair spent about 7 weeks in Sweden before Steele was  arrested Friday at the home of Pettersson, who joined them in Sweden a few days  after the boating hoax.  </P> <P> Steele said he was frustrated that his visitation rights had been cut from 4  days a week to 2 weekends a month. Marci Steele, 27, has been living with her  parents since the couple's bitter split in 1987. She has legal custody of  Schyler and the couple's other son, 2-year-old Garrett.  </P></p>

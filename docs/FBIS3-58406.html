Referring to Iran and Ireland as two spiritual countries,  Robinson said that Iran could count on Ireland as a good friend.    On strengthening bilateral ties she said that mutual  cooperation should in the long term pave the way for  strengthening the commonalties between the Muslims and the  Christians.    Expressing concern about the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina,  she said Ireland did not approve of what was going on there.    Velayati in his meeting with the Irish president defined his  talks with the Irish officials as well as the setting up of the  joint commission as "constructive."    Referring to the genocide of Muslims in Bosnia and the  indifference of international organizations towards the crimes  committed by the Serbs there, Velayati criticized the double  standard attitude of the UN Security Council towards the  Muslims.</p>

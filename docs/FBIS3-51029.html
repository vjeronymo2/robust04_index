			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, 11 Jan (NOTIMEX) --  Witnesses are reporting that an armed group of the self-styled  Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) took over for the  second time Chanal Municipality, southeastern Chiapas State,  early this morning.    A "large" number of EZLN members occupied Chanal, which had  been retaken by the Mexican Army five days ago. The reports do  not mention whether there is fighting. Chanal is located  approximately 50 km east of San Cristobal de las Casas, which is  located 1,200 km southeast of Mexico City and which was one of  the municipalities seized by the armed group on 1 January, when  the conflict began.    In a new operation, the Mexican Army is about 75 km from the  town of Guadalupe Tepeyac, which, according to witnesses, has  been cut off by armed men who dug five-meter deep trenches  around it.    According to the reports, Guadalupe Tepeyac has been under  the control of the armed group since 1 January, when the  conflict began with the violent seizure of towns and an attack  against a garrison, forcing the Army to intervene.    Witnesses say the armed group is preventing people from  entering or leaving the center of Guadalupe Tepeyac, southeast  Chiapas, near the Guatemalan border. Approximately 80 workers  of the public clinic in Guadalupe Tepeyac were released  yesterday by the armed group and are in Tuxtla Gutierrez,  capital of Chiapas.</p>

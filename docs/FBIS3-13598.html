			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by `Abd-al-'Aziz al-Sadiqi] </F>   [Text] Abu Dhabi--In spite of the appointment of Ahmad  Sa'id al-Badi, the UAE [United Arab Emirates] health minister,  as acting oil minister, succeeding resigning Minister Yusuf  Bin-'Umayr Bin-Yusuf, the councils and diwans in the UAE have  not stopped whispering about who will occupy the vacant  ministerial portfolio. In fact, the speculations have extended  to a wide-ranging cabinet shuffle or comprehensive change in the  composition of Vice President and Prime Minister Shaykh Maktum  Bin-Rashid al-Maktum's government, which has lasted nearly four  years.    With regard to the fact that some consider the appointment  of al-Badi as acting oil minister to be an indication of the UAE  leadership's tendency to reduce speculations about the identity  of the next oil minister, some believe this appointment to be a  temporary transition formula, while awaiting "the cooking up of  the new ministerial meal," which will not stop at the doors of  the Ministry of Oil, but will continue to include a  comprehensive reshuffle in most of the current Council of  Ministers. According to what some circles are repeating, the  change may extend to the Presidency itself, and these circles  say that it is likely that the current president, Shaykh Maktum  Bin-Rashid al-Maktum, will vacate his post as vice president and  ruler of the Emirate of Dubai.    If these rumors are true, the most likely candidate to  succeed Shaykh Maktum in the post of president is Shaykh Hamdan  Bin-Rashid al-Maktum, the current finance and industry minister  and the second oldest brother after Shaykh Maktum Bin-Rashid  al-Maktum. This formula has it that Shaykh Sultan Bin-Zayid Al  Nuhayyan, the current deputy prime minister of the Council of  Ministers, will retain his position in the new government, which  tallies with a tradition of separating the two posts so that the  one who leads the government is an official from the Emirate of  Dubai when his deputy is from the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.    Informed sources have ruled out the possibility that some of  the major portfolios will change, among them the defense  portfolio held by Shaykh Muhammad Bin-Rashid al-Maktum and the  higher education portfolio held by Shaykh Nuhayyan Bin-Mubarak  Al Nuhayyan, as well as some others held by shaykhs like the  Ministry of State for the Supreme Council's Affairs headed by  Shaykh Muhammad Bin-Saqr al-Qasimi, the Planning Ministry headed  by Shaykh Humayyid Bin-Rashid al-Mu'alla, and the Ministry of  Youth and Sports headed by Shaykh Faysal al-Qasimi.    Expected changes are in the service ministries, where the  sources expect Ahmad Sa'id al-Badi from the Health Ministry to  transfer to the Oil Ministry, at which he is acting. It is  expected that Ahmad Humayyid al-Tayir, minister of state for  financial and industrial affairs, will become minister of  finance and industry, succeeding Shaykh Hamdan Bin-Rashid  al-Maktum if the latter is appointed president.    Among the ministries around which the rumors are circulating  is the Foreign Ministry--occupied now by Rashid Bin-'Abdallah  al-Nu'aymi--where some expect Shaykh Hamdan Bin-Zayid Al  Nuhayyan to become minister in the place of his current post of  minister of state for foreign affairs, a post which he has held  for about four years.</p>

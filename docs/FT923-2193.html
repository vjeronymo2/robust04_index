			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Going Dutch in marriage: Matchmakers behind Reed Elsevier say it will be in top five of world's publishing groups Elsevier, the Dutch publisher which is to merge with Reed International, the UK publisher, has been looking for an English-speaking partner for years. The company, the most profitable Dutch publisher and the world's leading publisher of scientific journals, was as big as it was going to get in Holland. The only way forward was through acquisition or marriage. 'Stringing little pearls into a necklace with Pounds 10m to Pounds 30m acquisitions can take years,' said Mr Pierre Vinken, Elsevier chairman who will, if all goes well, become chairman of the new UK-registered holding company Reed Elsevier on January 1, 1993. It will be a company with a combined market capitalisation of Pounds 5.2bn or Fl 16.3bn. Mr Vinken and Mr Peter Davis, the Reed chairman who will be chief executive and deputy chairman of Reed Elsevier, believe the new company will be in the top five of the world's publishing and information companies: third behind Time Warner and Dun &amp; Bradstreet on market capitalisation; but number one on pre-tax profits. Talks with Reed go back to the early 1980s, but Mr Davis said 'somehow we couldn't make it fly'. Then the late Robert Maxwell bought 10 per cent of Elsevier shares before realising that they did not come with voting rights. In September 1988 Pearson, owners of the Financial Times, announced an 'engagement leading to marriage'. Both companies took stakes in each other but in less than three years it was all off mainly because the two companies had grown incompatible as the pound fell against the guilder and the Elsevier share price grew faster than Pearson. Yesterday Mr Vinken said: 'Anyone would go for a marriage of two rich families and let them sort it out.' The practical sorting out should not be difficult. 'No cash, no premium, no dilution,' said Mr Davis, who will take over as chairman of Reed Elsevier in 1995 when Mr Vinken retires. Reed and Elsevier will each have 50 per cent of a new holding company while each operating business will retain separate stock market listings. But because Reed has a larger capitalisation than Elsevier, it will receive a significant minority stake in the Dutch company. The companies will enter into an equalisation arrangement so one Elsevier share has the same economic benefit as 6.86 Reed shares. From the 1993 financial year, the companies will pay equivalent gross dividends, representing a doubling over Elsevier's current level. For Reed the merger achieves two aims - a stronger presence in Europe, and in high-value subscription-based publishing such as scientific journals. For Elsevier, it is a chance to enter areas where Reed is strong - business and consumer publishing. Mr Eric de Bellaigue, publishing analyst at stockbrokers Panmure Gordon, thought the merger held 'reasonable promise' for Reed as they were buying into higher value publishing, but 'it looks less advantageous for Elsevier'. Elsevier may be moving into areas which are dependent on volatile advertising revenues, but the Dutch company is making its deal at the low point of the cycle. A more important factor in the longer term is the financial clout the combined group could bring to the rapidly developing technologies of electronic publishing. The combined company will also carry clout as a predator. Official Airline Guides, one Robert Maxwell's US businesses, could be an early target because Reed is already in travel information. 'We are the logical buyer but not the logical people to pay a premium,' Mr Davis said. Although Reed and Elsevier will continue to operate as separate companies two businesses will be combined: the business-to-business magazine publishing activities of Elsevier and Reed in the US; and the scientific publishing business of Butterworth Heinemann will be combined with the much larger Elsevier Science Publishers. Elsevier's shares fell nearly 10 per cent to Fl 105.20 on the news of the merger, as investors acted on worries that the combined group would be more vulnerable to the vagaries of the business cycle than Elsevier has been on its own. Concern about future profits at Elsevier is acute because of the company's good record over the past 10 years, when earnings have shown compound growth of more than 15 per cent per year. 'In a 'bad' year Elsevier posts growth of only 10 per cent and in a 'good' year it exceeds 20 per cent,' a Dutch analyst said. Reed has been producing operating margins of more than 16 per cent in spite of the recession. At Reed's London headquarters yesterday all was harmony over the prospects for the latest Anglo-Dutch multi-national. Lord Blakenham, chairman of Pearson, even sent his good wishes. 'I wish them well,' he said. Asked if there was not any regret that it was Reed and not Pearson consumating a merger, Lord Blakenham added: 'Size isn't everything.' Lex, Page 22</p>

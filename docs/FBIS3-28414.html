			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, Feb. 6 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's  next-generation fighter program calling for the purchase of F-16  fighters equipped with an improved radar jammer has hit a snag,  as the Pentagon has excluded development money for the new  jammer model from its fiscal 1995 budget.    In Seoul the program, known as the Korean Fighter Program  (KFP), has become a political issue because of suspicions  surrounding the selection of F-16's as the Korean Air Force's  next-generation fighter.    The Pentagon's action, which apparently violates the  Seoul-Washington contract on the KFP, was made known on Sunday  when the Pentagon released its fiscal 1995 budget paper. It is  expected to cause problems in the security relationship between  the two governments.    Seoul and Washington have been disputing the question of  fixing the Airborne Self-Protection Jammer (ASPJ) on the F-16  fighters to be supplied to South Korea over the next several  years, and new Defense Secretary William Perry was recently  found to have been involved in the row when he was deputy  secretary.    The Pentagon budget paper does not mention the money needed  to improve the existing ASPJ model. This is seen as meaning  that the Pentagon has washed its hands of the ASPJ project,  seemingly because it failed to turn out an improved model.    The suspension of the ASPJ project would delay delivery of  the F-16 fighters, set to start in October, which would in turn  pose a stumbling block to the KFP, estimated at 5.4 trillion won  (6.7 billion U.S. dollars).    The Pentagon promised to supply F-16 fighters equipped with  an improved ASPJ model for the KFP, according to South Korean  officials here. But Defense Secretary Perry is known to have  recently pressed Seoul to buy ASPJ devices through commercial  channels because the Pentagon cannot guarantee the quality of  the ASPJ developed by ITT Corp.    Seoul has urged Washington to keep its promise to fit a new  model of ASPJ to the F-16 fighters for the KFP and supply the  fighters for the foreign military sales program, not through  commercial channels.</p>

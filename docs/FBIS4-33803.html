			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 10 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Today, Haitian  sectors favoring the return of ousted President Jean-Bertrand  Aristide demanded the resignation of the ruling military leaders  to prevent a U.S. military invasion.    Port-au-Prince Mayor Evans Paul called on General Raoul  Cedras to step down because, otherwise, "the sanctions will be  very, very hard on us.... It would be the end of the  country.... And worse, we are threatened by a military  invasion."    Because of the repression and precarious security situation  prevailing in Haiti, the Revolutionary Front for the Advance and  Progress of Haiti [FRAPH], a paramilitary organization  identified with the Army, has turned against its sponsors.    FRAPH leader Louis Jodel Chamblain reported he was the  victim  of an attack two days ago. "If I, Chamblain, am not safe, then  no Haitian can feel safe. No one can speak up in the country.  It is time to put an end to all this." For this reason, he  requested the international community's support in guaranteeing  the safety of all political leaders in the country.    The OAS-UN civilian delegation and other international  organizations blame FRAPH for much of the violence and  repression against popular organizations and Aristide's  followers. FRAPH has also been blamed for setting up a  demonstration in October 1993 to protest the arrival of the USS  Harlan County, which was carrying the first contingent of UN  Mission for Haiti military technicians.    Wednesday night, the Army demonstrated it is powerless to  ensure even its own security, when 10 men broke into Army  Headquarters and staged a shoot-out with the soldiers on duty.  The individuals succeeded in escaping from the military  installation, and none of them were arrested. A report of the  incident said the men "displayed military training and  knowledge."    According to unofficial reports, most of the soldiers fled  from the police quarters across the street from Army  Headquarters as soon as they heard about the incident. One  source said: "All of the policemen fled in civilian clothing and  without weapons. They had no intention of defending either  their quarters or their posts."    Several observers on the island noted that, if the military  cannot keep a small group of men from attacking its own  installations, "what could it possibly do against the Marines?"</p>

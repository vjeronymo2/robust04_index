			<p>BFN     [Text] Sydney, June 18 (AFP) -- State ministers said  Saturday they were outraged when the Australian Government  barred them from visiting a immigrants' detention centre.    Two conservative Liberal members of the New South Wales  state  parliament invited MPs to visit the Villawood Detention Centre  in western Sydney, where they said Cambodian boatpeople had been  held for up to four years.    State Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs Minister Michael  Photios organised the Monday tour with colleague Brad Hazzard  for delegates from all parties to inspect conditions.    The New South Wales state government is a conservative  alliance of Liberal and National parties while the Australian  Government of Prime Minister Paul Keating is Labor.    Photios said he was outraged when Australian Immigration  Minister Nick Bolkus formally denied access to the delegation of  more than 20 state MPs, mostly state government parliamentarians.    A spokeswoman for Bolkus said the minister had written to  Photios and Hazzard saying the MPs were playing political games  with the issue and under the circumstances he was not prepared  to accommodate the request.    She said Bolkus first heard of the proposed visit through  the  daily SYDNEY MORNING HERALD newspaper following an approach to  the paper by Hazzard.    There was "quite a big lag" between that report and Photios'  letter to Bolkus' office asking for permission to visit the  centre, indicating to the minister that it was a political  exercise, the spokeswoman said.    "He did point out to Photios ... that a whole range of  people do have access to Villawood including all the relative  support agencies and non-government agencies," she said.    "People can also visit on the invitation of the detainees  themselves."    Photios said he understood seven long-term detainees, mostly  women and children, were being held at Villawood, while 16  others remained in a similar centre at Port Hedland in Western  Australia's north.    "If it is good enough for Australian parliamentarians to  monitor the process of democracy in South Africa, it is good  enough for state parliamentarians to monitor what happens in  their own backyards," Photios said.    Bolkus' spokeswoman said only one Cambodian boatperson  remained at Villawood and he was booked on a flight back to  Cambodia within the next week or so.    Photios said the Australian Government allowed thousands of  illegal immigrants to move freely around Australia while they  waited for decisions on their status.    However, he said the boat people were detained because they  had arrived illegally when, at the time, there was no legal way  for them to get to Australia.    "Jailing them, while people who overstay tourist and student  visas are not detained, is the height of hypocrisy," Photios  said.</p>

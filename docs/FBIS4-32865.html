			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Beth Veloso from Congress] </F>   [Text] The party leaders' deadline to decide about calling  for new constitutional reforms is 31 May. This warning was made  by Constituent Congress President Senator Humberto Lucena.    According to Lucena, even if the constitutional reform work  continues for eight or 10 more days, the amendment that  contemplates reviewing the Constitution every 10 years will have  to be voted on in the first round of voting on 31 May:    [Begin Lucena recording] The deadline can be extended only  enough to allow Constituent Congress members to complete the  voting process in two rounds. [end recording]    Lucena also warned that he will only propose voting on the  amendment if there is a consensus among party leaders. So far  this consensus has not been ensured: The PT [Workers Party] and  the PDT [Democratic Labor Party] do not support the amendment  because it allows changes in the federal system and regarding  independence among the three government branches.</p>

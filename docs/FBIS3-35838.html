Stanislav Shushkevich Has Never Stood Up for  His Position Until the End. This Is His Political Drama."]    [Text] People's Deputy Viktar Hanchar commented on  Stanislav Shushkevich's dismissal from the position of the  Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman as follows: "The political  drama of Shushkevich-politician will be realized later." He,  along with People's Deputies Alyaksandr Lukashenka and Dzmitri  Bulakhaw, held a news conference after the results of the secret  ballot became known to the audience. Formally, Stanislav  Shushkevich was accused of "not taking measures to fight  corruption, lack of control over law enforcement organs, and  personal immodesty," however, in fact, this was only a formal  pretext for his recall, the organizers of the news conference  stated.    "We admit that deputies have long wished to discharge  Shushkevich and have looked for some formal pretexts to do so.  Therefore, the legislature raised the issue of recalling  Shushkevich from his post four times already," said Viktar  Hanchar.    According to the people's deputies, Shushkevich's primary  mistake was that he did not follow a steady political course.  Despite his claim that he subordinates to the will of the  legislative majority (represented by left wing deputies), the  former Supreme Soviet chairman did not advocate their ideas. In  his last speech, Stanislav Shushkevich also renounced his  political union with the opposition faction, though this group  of deputies supported him. As a result, Shushkevich-politician  remained alone.    In the opinion of the people's deputies, the tragedy of  Shushkevich lies in the fact that he has never stood up for the  most important issues -- holding a referendum and early Supreme  Soviet elections, signing a collective security agreement, etc.  -- until the end.    How will Shushkevich's dismissal affect the activity of the  Belarusian Supreme Soviet? In the opinion of the organizers of  this news conference, the stage of political conflicts in the  Supreme Soviet is over, and the time for organized work has  arrived.    Well, will Shushkevich's resignation change the political  course of the Belarusian legislature?    The people's deputies were unanimous: No, this will not  happen; simply the left wing deputies will elect their new  leader, and we could make some prognosis based on the behavior  of the people's deputies.....</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Sarajevo, April 20 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb forces  Wednesday [20 April] shelled the besieged Moslem enclave of  Gorazde, killing more people, despite a "unilateral peace"  announcement and an undertaking by their political leadership to  let UN peacekeepers into the city. [passage omitted] Meanwhile  Pope John Paul II appealed to all sides to respect the ceasefire  and resume peace talks. He deplored that the "assault on the  martyred city could go on... despite the truce promised by the  besieging forces."    A statement from Karadzic's office said the Bosnian Serbs  had  Wednesday "unilaterally proclaimed peace at Gorazde, which ends  the crisis around the town," the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA  reported. This "act" was in response to statements Tuesday from  the Russian and U.S. presidents, Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton,  the statement added. [passage omitted]    An UNPROFOR official here said Wednesday that under the  truce  agreement, signed with the UN late Tuesday night in nearby Pale,  the Serb side agreed to stop firing "immediately" as long as  they were not attacked. However shelling continued early  Wednesday although with less intensity, UNPROFOR spokesman Major  Rob Annink said. Several shells hit a building housing UN  military observers but left no casualties, and it was dangerous  to move around the town, he added. Meanwhile refugees continued  to flood in, he said. Serb forces appeared to be trying to  block the road leading west out of the town, on the left bank,  he added.    Under the temporary ceasefire, the Serbs had agreed to cease  military activities over a three-kilometer (two-mile) stretch of  land, starting from central Gorazde and running to the left bank  of the Drina, which divides the town. UNPROFOR and other  humanitarian groups could help civilians, and organize medical  evacuations and prisoner exchanges in that area. [passage  omitted] In Geneva, a spokesman for the UN High Commission for  Refugees quoted their doctor in charge of medical evacuations,  Gordona Stjepanovic, as saying "the situation is worse in  Gorazde than it was in the worst moments in Sarajevo."  Spokesman Ron Redmond said there was "nothing to eat" and  people "risk their lives" trying to get water. On Tuesday, 43  people were killed, including six children, and 112 people were  wounded, bringing the total since the Serb offensive began March  28 to 345 dead and 1,187 wounded, UNHCR said.</p>

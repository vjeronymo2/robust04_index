			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TREATMENT OF ROGERS  </P> <P> As a retired United States Navy officer, I want to remind the parents and staff  at La Jolla Country Day School that there's a price for freedom. And the  prerequisites are courage, honor and a deep respect for the well-being of your  fellow man.  </P> <P> Mr. Burns, these are not qualities which a public relations firm can provide  you. However, you can admit you made a mistake and return Sharon Rogers to her  fourth-grade class.  </P> <P> I can't think of a better way of teaching our kids that our freedom is worth  preserving.  </P> <P> CAPT. FRANK HOFFMAN (Ret.)  </P> <P> Coronado  </P></p>

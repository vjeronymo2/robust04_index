			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Observer: Gorby's Red Star special Karl Marx must be spinning in his tomb. Not only has Mikhail Gorbachev - together with the glamorous Raisa - taken to riding across America's skies on Forbes Magazine's well-appointed 'Capitalist Tool' jet, but last night he was guest of honour at Forbes' 75th birthday celebration at New York's Radio City Music Hall. Is there nothing the world's favourite ex-Soviet president won't do for publicity? Taking a cue from his old friend Ronald Reagan, Gorbachev is cashing in on his reputation now that he is free from the cares of office. Last week 500 guests paid Dollars 5,000 each to attend a Reagan Library lunch for Mr G. Then, in San Francisco, another 4,000 local fans paid Dollars 40 a ticket to hear a Gorbachev speech. This week's lecture on anti-Semitism at Yeshiva University, a Jewish college, is expected to raise another Dollars 1m for the Gorbachev Foundation. In between times he will visit the New York Stock Exchange and break bread with Henry Kissinger. Yet nothing is as surreal as the flirtation between Gorby and the eccentric Forbes Magazine. Last night he joined Ronnie at Forbes' mogul-studded Radio City event, with 3,000 guests ranging from First Boston's Jack Hennessy to clothes designer Ralph Lauren. Maggie Thatcher was invited to the Forbes bash, but sadly couldn't make it. Forbes is reluctant to explain the terms on which Gorbachev borrowed its jet, but it sounds as if it was a quid pro quo for his appearance at the Radio City bash. Whatever the terms, Malcolm S Forbes junior, 44, seems to be trying to live up to his father's hell-raising reputation. But somehow he doesn't seem to have quite the same sort of pizazz.</p>

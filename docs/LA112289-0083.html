			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE DIVISION MEN'S PREVIEW;  </P> <P> IF THEY'RE DOWN BY THE RIVERSIDE, CCAA RACE WILL TIGHTEN UP  </P> <P> The expectations were anticipated.  </P> <P> But John Masi, coach of the UC Riverside men's basketball team, wonders if they  are warranted.  </P> <P> Since the Highlanders posted the best record in NCAA Division II basketball  last season at 30-4, and finished third in the national championship  tournament, Masi realizes that the pressure to duplicate those accomplishments  will be great.  </P> <P> "We will have people comparing us (to last season's team) all year long," he  said. "My biggest job this year is to not let our team get caught up in  expectations. The advantage other teams will have is that they will also look  at what we did last year in preparing for us."  </P> <P> With the graduation of All-American guard Maurice Pullum and Chris Jackson, an  All-California Collegiate Athletic Assn. guard, the comparisons may indeed be a  little unfair.  </P> <P> But the Highlanders do have an All-CCAA performer returning in forward Chris  Ceballos, and three other players who started at least seven games. They are  point guard Reggie Howard -- a superb three-point shooter -- and forwards Mike  Ritter and Jason Ricks.  </P> <P> All of which makes another CCAA championship and trip to the Division II  tournament a distinct possibility.  </P> <P> Riverside's closest competition should come from another traditional conference  power, Cal State Bakersfield, although the CCAA appears improved down the line.  </P> <P> Cal State Bakersfield's Pat Douglass has guided the Roadrunners into the  playoffs in his first two seasons as coach.With four top players returning from  a 21-9 squad, the trend should continue this season.  </P> <P> Bakersfield has two starters back, forward Marvin Redeemer and guard Wade  Green, and top reserves Beau Redstone at forward and Willie Austin at guard  also return. Toss in redshirt guards Ray Burris and Fred Eckles and the  Roadrunners have good reason to make postseason plans.  </P> <P> Usually a CCAA title contender, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo slipped to sixth place  in the conference and 14-12 overall last season. However, the return of four  starters plus the addition of two Division-I transfers should make a noticeable  difference for the Mustangs. Returning players include All-CCAA forward Coby  Naess and guards James Gama and Shawn Reed. Transfers include forwards Stuart  Thomas from Stanford and Tim Knowles from Texas San Antonio.  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge is hoping to leave a lasting impression on the CCAA in its  final season in the conference before stepping up to Division I next year.  </P> <P> The Matadors, who finished 16-11 last season, may have the personnel to  contend, including All-CCAA guard Derrick Gathers -- whose brother Hank stars  for Loyola Marymount -- and forward Kris Brodowski and guard Jemarl Baker. The  down side is a difficult schedule that includes four Division I opponents.  </P> <P> Where Bob Boyd goes, success usually follows. In 28 seasons, Boyd has a 456-309  record and has been coach of the year in four conferences including the  Southeastern and the Pacific 10.  </P> <P> So it will be no surprise if he has a solid team in his first year as coach of  Chapman, where the Panthers were 17-12 last season. The top returning player is  forward Rog Middleton, and Boyd has a solid recruiting class, headed by swing  man Von Shuler.  </P> <P> With the graduation of All-American center Anthony Blackman and the return of  only one starter from a team that finished 20-10 and reached the Division II  playoffs, Cal State Dominguez Hills will have one of the youngest teams in the  CCAA, but the Toros have plenty of ability.  </P> <P> The leaders are point guard Robert Barksdale, swing man Kevin Shaw and guard  Segaro Bozart. The Toros also have two top freshmen in forwards Vincent  Washington and Norman Francis.  </P> <P> It has been a long time since Cal Poly Pomona has been competitive in the CCAA,  but Coach Dave Bollwinkel is optimistic. The Broncos have forward Jim Skinner  and guard D.J. Norman back and added two all-state junior college players in  forward Terry Ross and guard Chancellor McCobb. That should help the team  improve upon its marks of 1-13 in the CCAA and 7-19 overall last season.  </P> <P> With a 1-27 record and a 4-48 mark over the last two seasons, the Cal State Los  Angeles program apparently has sunk to new depths. Only forward Andre White is  returning and the Golden Eagles will rely mostly on transfers, such as forward  LaVar Ball from Washington State and guard Darron Jackson from El Camino  College.  </P> <P> NAIA  </P> <P> In the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics, Southern California College  was ranked No. 19 in a preseason poll and looms as the team to beat for the  District 3 title, although Westmont and Biola are also strong contenders.  </P> <P> Southern California made giant strides by going 29-5 and winning the Golden  State Athletic Conference last season. The only element missing was a district  title and berth in the NAIA national tournament, goals which appear within  reach this season.  </P> <P> Back are all-district center Jeff Bickmore and forwards Terry Scruggs and John  Mounce. The Vanguards also added a top junior college prospect in guard Elbert  Davis from Golden West.  </P> <P> With no seniors, Westmont will have one of its youngest teams. Even so, the  Warriors, who finished 18-13 and reached the district semifinals last season,  still expect to excel in district play. Top players include junior forwards  Peter Partain and Noel Matthews and junior guards Chris Brown and Chad  Kammerer, whose father Chet has coached Westmont for 24 seasons and has a  475-230 record.  </P> <P> There is a new coach at Biola this season, although he is hardly a stranger to  the school. Howard Lyon returns to the school at which he built a 401-143  record and won five District 3 titles in 17 seasons. He has his work cut out,  though, with no starters returning from a team that was 29-8 and won the  district title.  </P> <P> Lyon will rely largely on transfers such as 6-9 center Jeff Baker, forward Tim  Ericksen, swing man Jeffrey Lee and guard Kellie McKinney.  </P> <P> The Master's reached the .500 mark in its first season under Coach Mel  Hankinson last season and, with its top players returning and the addition of  key transfers, the program appears on the way up. The Mustangs, 15-15 last  season, have top scorers Tom Bruner and Jason Webster at forward and also add  NCAA Division I transfers guard Damon Greer from San Jose State and 6-8 center  Dan Jarms from Eastern Washington.  </P> <P> Terry Layton, second-year coach of Azusa Pacific, was in an unaccustomed  position when his team finished at 12-19 last season. It marked the first time  in his nine-year career that he had coached a losing team.  </P> <P> That should not become a trend, though, since Layton has forward Michael Benton  and point guard Titus Randle back, and transfers Patrick McMann from Northern  Arizona and Jeff Hester from Portland, both 6-8 forwards.  </P> <P> Cal Baptist has posted two consecutive 20-win seasons, but with only one senior  on the roster and with Warren Daniels and David Solomons the only players  returning from last year's team, the Lancers may struggle to approach their  recent success. Cal Baptist will also rely on forwards Jon Gorzeman and Jim  Reynolds.  </P> <P> It figures to be a transition season for Cal Lutheran, too. There is a new  coach, former USC assistant Mike Dunlap, and graduation took guard Steve  deLaveaga, the all-time scoring leader. The Kingsmen may have a worthy  replacement in guard Jeff deLaveaga -- Steve's brother who redshirted last  season. Cal Lutheran, 11-17 last year, will also count heavily on returning  center Mike Demeter.  </P> <P> There is nowhere to go but up for Christ College Irvine, which was 0-14 in the  Golden State Athletic Conference and 4-26 overall last season. The Eagles will  be improved with the return of guards Aaron Clasen and Albert Gay and forward  Keith Rogers, and the addition of high-scoring transfer Kevin Kurz at forward,  although victories will still be in short supply.  </P> <P> SCIAC  </P> <P> In the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, Pomona-Pitzer  has the personnel to repeat as conference champion, although transfer-heavy La  Verne and traditional power Claremont-Mudd-Scripps should also contend.  </P> <P> One of the biggest surprises last season was Pomona-Pitzer, which won the SCIAC  title with a 9-1 record, finished 18-10 overall and reached the Division III  playoffs under first-year Coach Charles Katsiaficas.  </P> <P> With seven lettermen returning, a repeat performance would not be surprising.  The Sagehens are led by forwards Jared Holum and James Johnson and have adept  outside shooters in guards Reed Porter and David Todd.  </P> <P> It might be too much to expect La Verne to go from worst to first in one  season. But with the influx of outstanding transfers, the Leopards will not  look anything like the team that was 0-10 in the SCIAC and 5-21 overall last  season.  </P> <P> Topping the list is forward Andre Purry from Cal State Long Beach. Others  include forwards Deshang Weaver and John Jackson and guard Shaun Manning. The  top player returning is All-SCIAC guard Lamont Landers.  </P> <P> Claremont-Mudd-Scripps usually falls among the leaders in the SCIAC race and  this season should be no exception. The Stags, who finished second in the SCIAC  at 7-3 and 14-11 overall last season, have excellent front-line players in  center Henry Albrecht and forwards John Gilliland and Chris Greene. A key will  be how fast the team's inexperienced guards develop.  </P> <P> It will be a tall order to stop Occidental with the return of All-SCIAC  performer Chris Anderson, 6-9, and John Crowley, 6-8, in the team's double-post  offense. The Tigers, who were 15-10 and tied Redlands for third in the SCIAC  last season, also have starters Ethan Caldwell at point guard and Brett Dennis  at forward.  </P> <P> Although it might not be the best team in the SCIAC, Redlands could be the most  entertaining. The Bulldogs averaged a Division III-leading 100.3 points and  10.4 three-pointers last season, when they finished 15-10. The outlook is  similar, despite the graduation of All-SCIAC forward Perry Bellaire. Redlands  has two returning starters in swing man Robert Stone and forward Darryl  Robinson.  </P> <P> With no starter taller than 6-4 and five of its top six players from last  season's 11-15 squad having graduated, Whittier could have problems ahead. The  Poets will count on forward Whalen Elmore, the only starter returning, and  guards David Hune and Chris Seibert, both excellent outside shooters.  </P> <P> INDEPENDENT  </P> <P> Cal State San Bernardino, a Division III independent that finished 20-6 and  reached the playoffs last season, will have difficulty replacing graduated  All-American center Mark Warren and all-region forward Gerald Duncan. Even so,  the outlook is bright with the return of guards Dave Webb and Troy Adams and  forward Greg Rowe, plus an excellent recruiting class.  </P></p>

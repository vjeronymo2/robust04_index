			<p>BFN     [Text] Chechen parliament's Speaker Akhyad Idigov did not  rule out that after the dismissal of Sergey Shakhray from the  post of the Russian Minister for Nationalities and Regional  Policies the policy of Russia towards Chechnya could toughen.  Idigov said in an interview with Interfax today that he saw no  connection between the dismissal of Shakhray and his tough  position to Chechnya.    "This policy is being defined either by more high-ranking  officials or by the Russian legislative institutions," Idigov  stated having concluded that the policy of Russia towards  Chechnya could not be altered much after the dismissal of one  politician.    "If the Russian leadership wanted to alter its policy it  would do this even without consulting Shakhray," Idigov  suggested.    "It is likely that his policy has just come to a deadlock  and  it was high time to dismiss him," Idigov concluded.</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Buy-out plan for threatened Daf truck plant A MANAGEMENT team at the Leyland Daf truck plant in Lancashire is preparing a management-led buy-out of the threatened truck assembly operations. The three-man team is being led by Mr John Gilchrist, managing director, and is being advised by Coopers and Lybrand, the accountancy firm. The proposal for the management buy-out is still at an early stage, and Mr Gilchrist warned yesterday that its eventual success would depend on the Leyland plant receiving a contract to supply its range of UK-built Daf 45 light trucks to newly-formed Daf Trucks in the Netherlands. It is understood that separate preliminary talks are also being held by the administrative receivers for Leyland Daf with Paccar, the US truck maker, about a possible takeover or acquisition of a stake in the Leyland plant. Truck production was re-started yesterday at Leyland for the first time since Leyland Daf went into receivership three weeks ago. The Leyland workforce has already been reduced to 1,346 from 2,114 before the company collapsed. Final negotiations took place in Paris last night between the UK receivers and Renault over the future of the Birmingham-based Excel van project for the development of a range to be launched in the mid-1990s. Renault is expected to announce today that it will press ahead alone with the project after agreeing a sub-contract arrangement with the UK receivers for the services of about 190 Leyland Daf engineering staff at the Birmingham van plant. Agreement has been reached for Renault to take over all the industrial property rights for the new van range, which began originally as a joint development project between Daf and the French vehicle maker in 1990. Renault will continue its urgent search for a new partner to replace Daf to share the burden of the development costs of the new range which is due to replace the Renault Master and part of the Renault Trafic range. Volkswagen of Germany, which must replace its present LT heavy van range later in the 1990s, is considered a potential partner, while General Motors Europe has also held talks with Renault about a possible collaborative van venture. In Eindhoven, Daf's Dutch receivers said they had received assurances from the UK receivers that the new Dutch/Belgian Daf Trucks company could continue to count on essential parts and components being delivered from Leyland Daf's British plants. If Leyland Daf should cease production for any reason, Daf Trucks has secured an agreement in principle that it may purchase the machinery and equipment so that it can make the parts itself. Leyland Daf currently supplies cab pressings from Birmingham, axle components from Glasgow and crankshafts from Leyland. The Dutch and Belgian governments have waived their rights to a voting majority in Daf Trucks NV despite their combined majority stake in the proposed new company. Mr Friso Meeter, one of Daf's two Dutch receivers, denied yesterday that the new Daf could be considered a 'nationalised' company following the weekend deal whereby the Netherlands and Belgium agreed to provide a combined Fl 270m towards fresh equity of up to Fl 500m. He disclosed that it was the 'express wish' of the two governments that their combined control over the company be limited to a minority influence. Daf Trucks NV is to be established on Friday as the successor company to Daf, which went into receivership on February 2. Leyland Daf, Daf's UK subsidiary, is excluded from the deal and its future depends on the success of the UK receivers' plans for saving the constituent parts of the business. Preliminary talks have also been held with Unipart, the UK parts distribution and engineering group, about the acquisition of the Leyland Daf spare parts operation at Chorley, Lancashire.

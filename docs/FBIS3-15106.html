			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Gamov report on telephone interview with Russian </F> State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin; place and date of interview not  given: "Evening Call to Ivan Rybkin"]    [Text] [Gamov] Ivan Petrovich, the State Duma's amnesty  decision provoked a stormy outburst of emotions in society and a  sharp protest and alarm among many Russians due to the possible  exacerbation of the political situation in the country. Does  this worry you personally?    [Rybkin] For some reason one decree is being taken out of  the context of all the State Duma decrees adopted 23 February,  namely the one on a political and economic amnesty. Although we  have issued a package of five documents, the main one of them  being the Memorandum on Accord which says that, together with  the government and president and other federal power structures,  we must elaborate in the next two to three months joint  approaches toward solving a wide range of problems of a  political, economic, national, and social nature.    All this work should have preceded the implementation of the  decree on an amnesty, because the amnesty itself is supposed to  last quite a long time. Under the president's legislative  initiative it is proposed to release a total of 222,000 people  from places of confinement and national economic construction  sites, plus those involved in the events of August 1991 and  September and October 1993.    It turned out that some inconsistency arose in implementing  the adopted decisions because of insufficiently efficient  coordination between the authorities. Undoubtedly all this  creates certain problems in society. Nevertheless, based on the  provisions of the Memorandum on Accord, we must see to it that  the people who have been released find their place in this life  and that they are actively included in constructive work to  extricate Russia from the crisis.    I think an absolute majority of them will do just that. But  if some people lack the intelligence, the heart, or the desire  to work for accord.... The state has the strength to put them  in their place. Especially as the supplement to the Criminal  Code, which has already been given its first reading and which  will, I hope, acquire the force of law in the near future,  envisages the strengthening of punishments relating precisely to  the entire range of articles referred to in the decree on an  amnesty.</p>

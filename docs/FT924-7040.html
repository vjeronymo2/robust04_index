			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / International Bonds: Indigestion may follow Kingdom of Sweden's issue THE Kingdom of Sweden yesterday became the second Scandinavian borrower in as many days to look to the bond markets for Dollars 2bn. However, its three-year issue was compared unfavourably with Finland's five-year global bonds launched the day before. Some traders complained about the amount, the maturity and the borrowing instrument although they did agree, largely, that the pricing looked just about right. Such a large amount could, however, take some time to digest, particularly in the light of Finland's success. After a series of deals in D-Marks, French francs and sterling over five years, Sweden's decision to diversify its maturities with a big liquid current coupon benchmark deal in the three-year range was not totally vindicated. Joint lead manager and book runner J. P. Morgan confirmed that while demand was good the issue did not sell out. As Sweden's increased Dollars 5bn SEC shelf registration in New York is now effective, some traders thought it odd the kingdom should launch such a large Eurobond rather than try a global issue. But Credit Suisse First Boston, the other lead manager, said that one of the main attractions of the Eurobond market remained the ability to launch such a large deal at very short notice. The bonds bring the total raised on the capital markets under the second phase of the kingdom's emergency borrowing programme to around Ecu6.5bn, said Mr Staffan Crona, director-general of the Swedish National Debt Office. This leaves a further Ecu8.5bn to be raised. Finland's global issue, priced yesterday at the bottom of its indicated range to yield 82 basis points over Treasuries, was still generating excitement and comment. It vindicates the global issue concept for big issues, say some traders. Finland has got a better deal than anyone thought possible a few weeks ago, and set itself up to tap residual demand in the US next year where investors could well be persuaded to buy more at longer maturities. Elsewhere, SudWestLB took advantage of the continuing demand for high-quality current coupon Eurosterling paper with its Pounds 100m 10-year 8 5/8 per cent subordinated bond. The implicit state guarantee enjoyed by German borrowers such as SudWestLB means that in effect they cannot go bankrupt and can launch subordinated debt at a very tight spread to gilts. Lead manager Lehman Brothers said it had identified a particular lack of supply of triple-A rated bonds in the 10-year range, and that the issue traded around the reoffer spread after it broke syndicate. In the equity-related sector, Square D's discounted convertible issue provides Schneider, its French parent, with low-cost funds to refinance Dollars 150m of a seven-year term loan it raised to help buy Square D in 1991. Ireland is being talked about as a potential borrower of Dollars 300m-Dollars 500m over five years.</p>

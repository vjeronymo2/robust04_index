			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and Mikhail </F> Melnik]    [Text] Kiev, 28 May -- The Crimean leadership's position  will damage "Ukraine's goodneighborly relations with Russia,  which have always been, and still are, the determining factor in  spite of everything," Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk  believes. The Ukrainian head of state said this at the end of  his one-day visit to Chernobyl AES [nuclear power station] and  to the power workers' town of Slavutich. "The leaders of the  Crimean Republic say they want to be a bridge between Ukraine  and Russia, but in fact they are laying a `mine' under this  bridge," the president said.    Leonid Kravchuk believes that there are forces that are  doing  this consciously, and there are also those who are laying this  `mine' because they can see no civilized way to resolve the  problem" [no open quotation marks as received]. "They have an  arsenal of rallies and slogans," he added. At the same time,  the president voiced the hope that "common sense will prevail  among those who are disregarding the laws and Constitution of  Ukraine and the universally acknowledged principles of the world  community."    The president thinks "no one has the right to cross over the  `red' line in pursuit of ambitions. If anyone goes this far, we  will take decisive and consistent action, but within the  framework of the Constitution. There is no other way." There  is only one way: To resolve all problems peacefully in  accordance with the law, Leonid Kravchuk emphasized.    He also issued a warning to those who strive to achieve  their  own parochial interests. The president stressed: There are  enough forces in Ukraine to neutralize those who "resort to  unlawful actions." He stressed at the same time that he will  not permit any infringement of the principles of goodneighborly  relations with Russia.</p>

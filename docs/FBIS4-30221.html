			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- A Japan-U.S.-European  consortium of five companies signed an agreement Thursday [23  June] with Russian authorities on a project for exploration of  undersea oil and natural gas resources off Sakhalin, Russia,  Japanese company officials said.    The agreement was signed in Washington by officials from the  consortium, the Russian Ministry of Fuel and Energy and the  local government of Sakhalin, the officials said.    The consortium comprises Mitsui and Co. and Mitsubishi Corp.  of Japan, McDermott Inc. and Marathon Oil Co. of the United  States and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group.    They said the consortium will start exploration efforts in a  few years, subject to approval by the Russian federal  legislature and the local Sakhalin assembly, and start  production early in the 21st century.    Surveys have shown the area proposed for exploration has  potential deposits of 100 million tons of crude oil and 400  billion cubic meters of natural gas.    Crude oil production from the project, which is expected to  cost approximately 1 trillion yen, is expected to amount to a  maximum of 180,000 barrels per day.    All the crude oil produced will be exported to Asia,  including Japan, while two-thirds of the natural gas will be  exported and the rest will be consumed in Russia, the officials  said.</p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SKIING;  </P> <P> CONDITIONS ARE EXCELLENT FOR THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND  </P> <P> Conditions in the mountains of the Southland and the High Sierra are ideal for  the big Presidents' Day weekend, which normally signifies the start of spring  skiing.  </P> <P> This year, however, skiers will find packed powder, relatively crisp  temperatures and, if all goes well, plenty of sunshine.  </P> <P> California snow depths range from three feet on up -- to as high as 12 feet in  the north -- and all systems appear to be go everywhere at least through  Easter, March 26, and probably well beyond.  </P> <P> Jimmie Heuga, the Olympic bronze medalist at Innsbruck, Austria, in 1964, will  be at Snow Summit Saturday, along with many of his friends for the next stop on  the Jimmie Heuga Express.  </P> <P> The event is one of 22 in North America this season, which are expected to  raise about 45% of the budget for the Jimmie Heuga Center for the physically  challenged.  </P> <P> Under the Express' format, each host resort recruits as many co-ed teams of  three skiers each as possible, in an attempt to ski more than a total of 1  million vertical feet on a designated run on the same day.  </P> <P> To participate, each team must raise a minimum of $1,000 in tax-deductible  sponsorship donations. Then, the team at each resort that accumulates the most  points -- a combination of dollars raised and vertical feet skied -- will earn  an expenses-paid trip to the Heuga Express Championship finals April 5-9 at  Vail, Colo., where the center is located.  </P> <P> Teams are still being formed for the Snow Summit event, and more information is  available by calling (213) 697-8941.  </P> <P> The Express' other California stops are at Mammoth Mountain Feb. 24 and Squaw  Valley March 10.  </P> <P> Snow Summit will also be the site of the Vuarnet Vertical Airshow Sunday, when  some of the nation's top snowboard competitors will display their skills.  </P> <P> The field is headed by Santa Monica's Bert LaMar, a two-time World Cup champion  in the sport, which is kind of a combination of skiing and surfing.  </P> <P> Skiing Notes  </P> <P> World Cup ski racing resumes Friday, after a break for the World Alpine Ski  Championships at Vail, Colo. The men will compete in a downhill, super-G and  giant slalom at Aspen, Colo., and the women will go in a downhill and a super-G  at Lake Louise, Canada. ESPN will show the Aspen races at 5 p.m., PST, on  Friday, and 2:30 p.m., both Saturday and Sunday. . . . The U.S. Pro Tour will  stop at Angel Fire, N.M., Saturday and Sunday.  </P> <P> Nick Badami, chairman and president of Alpine Meadows of Tahoe, which also owns  the Park City Ski Area in Utah, said this week that his company "is nearing  completion of the environmental impact statement" for the new Galena resort,  near Reno, which it plans to open for the 1991-92 season. . . . Richard  Steadman, one of the world's foremost orthopedic surgeons, is considering an  offer to head a new sports medicine center in Vail, but said this week that any  decision "is at least a year and a half away." He added: "For the remainder of  this season and all of next, at least, I will continue to be at South Lake  Tahoe."  </P> <P> Cindy Nelson, former U.S. ski team star, was chief of course for the women's  giant slalom at Vail last Saturday, becoming the first woman to have this  responsibility in a world championship race.  </P></p>

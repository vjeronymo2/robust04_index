Father Christmas was around during the holiday celebrations and  reminded us that besides economic recovery, we have an important  exercise to undertake this year -- the legislative elections  slated for 23 January and 6 February. This ballot is an  important landmark for the continuity and success of the  democratic process which must be marked this year by the  creation of all the institutions of the Fourth Republic, which  was ushered in by the constitutional referendum of September  1992. The fact remains, however, that the upcoming legislative  elections must be free and fair and must be held in an  atmosphere of security for all. This is the best wish of  President General Gnassingbe Eyadema. He stated this in a  communique presented here by Adjobi Adjadaye.    [Begin Adjadaye recording] The president of the Republic has  taken good note of the progress made in the preparations for the  upcoming legislative elections. As he had already stated in his  first message to the nation in the aftermath of his election as  president, the head of state fervently wishes that all those who  were not able to be part of the first stage of our democratic  process take part in the second stage of national unity, so that  together we can all take part in the legislative elections on  the scheduled dates.    In this spirit the president indicated last November that it  was necesary to take into consideration the opinions of French  and German electoral experts. Also, to iron out difficulties and  create a general atmosphere of trust, the president of the  Republic has met several times with the International Monitoring  Commission and the National Electoral Commission [CEN], the  government officials charged with organizing the legislative  elections.    All these efforts testify to the constantly renewed  political  will of the head of state to contribute to a peaceful conclusion  of the democratic process within the strict respect of the  Ouagadougou accord. This is why the president of the Republic  once again invites the CEN and the government officials charged  with organizing the legislative elections, and the political  parties to double their efforts with a view to accelerating and  contributing positively to the carrying out of material tasks so  that the elections can be held in a free, fair and secure  atmosphere for all. Our people have suffered for far too long  from this long transition and it is our duty to move heaven and  earth for the elections to take place at the scheduled dates so  that we can get to work.

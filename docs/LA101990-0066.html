			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> MORE CITY CONTROLS URGED IN RURAL ZONE  </P> <P> Developers of houses in Camarillo's "rural exclusive zone" will face more  design scrutiny if the City Council follows a Planning Commission  recommendation.  </P> <P> The rural zone is generally used for estate and custom house development on  large lots.  </P> <P> The proposed change in zoning would allow the Planning Department to limit  colors, textures and materials on new or remodeled residences. Under the  existing ordinance, the city can only dictate the structure's height and  distance from the street.  </P> <P> The amendment will allow for greater review and control in the design of  projects, Planning Director Matthew A. (Tony) Boden said Tuesday. The  agricultural and rural zones are the only zones exempt from a design review by  the city. The City Council will consider the ordinance change in November.

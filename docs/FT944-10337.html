			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Japanese students feel jobs squeeze: Recession means a university education is no longer enough The cloistered serenity of one of Japan's more exclusive educational establishments has been disturbed. Gakushuin University, a sylvan oasis in Tokyo's concrete desert, has been the alma mater of Japan's emperors for centuries. Mere mortals have thrived there, too - a degree from Gakushuin is usually considered a ticket to a safe career in Japan's economic aristocracy. But this year, employment opportunities are thinner than ever and a mood of doubt has punctured the self-confidence of many of the nation's elite students. According to Mr Makoto Sano, who runs the job placement office, fewer than a fifth of students have already found jobs - half the number this time last year, itself one of the worst years ever. The employment outlook has deteriorated so sharply that the university has for the first time established special seminars aimed at equipping this year's graduates with the tools needed to impress would-be employers. 'The students' situation is more difficult than for many years,' he says There has scarcely been a worse time to be graduating from a Japanese university, traditionally the natural pool of labour for the country's corporations. Figures published this week by the education ministry showed that the proportion of university students graduating this March who found employment slumped to its lowest level since 1950. Just 70 per cent of college-leavers found jobs in the annual round of company recruitment, down from 76 per cent last year and nearly 12 points below the peak year of 1991. The figures do not just demonstrate the severity of the lingering recession. They herald a significant change in the Japanese labour market as companies continue the painful process of adjusting to the more competitive climate of the 1990s. They suggest the secure progress from school to university to corporation, taken for granted by the nation's graduates, may be a thing of the past. The scale of the downturn has been magnified by an atavistic tendency by Japanese companies to resist redundancies. Faced with falling demand and excess capacity, the leading employers have all cut recruitment more deeply than ever. Toyota Corporation has reduced its graduate intake from nearly 900 three years ago to an expected 200 this year. NTT, Japan's and the world's largest company, has frozen recruitment completely. Matsushita Electric is planning to take on its lowest number of graduates since 1979. As ever in Japan's male-dominated economy, women have been particularly affected by the slump in graduate demand. The employment rate for female university graduates sank this year by 8 points to 67.6 per cent. Since 1991, the average number of job offers per female college graduate has fallen from 1.98 to 0.87. Labour market-watchers say Japan's women are entering an 'employment ice age'. According to a report by the Japan Productivity Centre this year, 51 per cent of graduate-recruiting companies were expecting not to recruit women at all. What alarms many students, male and female, however, is that when the economy at last recovers from the long recession, companies will have a different set of objectives that will exclude many of them. The education ministry says: 'Structural changes are now affecting the employment of graduates; the numbers are likely to fall further yet.' The shift of manufacturing production offshore in response to the high yen and the need for businesses to trim costs to remain competitive will weaken demand for labour. There is as yet little prospect of an end to the principle of lifetime employment and so smaller graduate numbers and more early retirements are the only means by which payrolls can be slimmed. But, more importantly, Japanese companies are becoming much more choosy in their recruitment. When employment prospects do improve, the chances are that job opportunities for graduates will be less rosy. According to one employment consultant, businesses for years snapped up the annual supply of graduates, investing vast capital in them in the expectation that they would produce a long-term return over a lifetime of employment. Now, he says, companies are operating on a shorter timescale. 'Companies are becoming more inclined to tap the pool of already qualified labour and see earlier returns on their investment. They see new graduates as expensive, illiquid assets. Better to have fully functioning liquid assets on your books.' University careers advisers like Mr Sano are already advising students that this means a good university education, even from the best universities, may no longer guarantee a job for life in one of the Japanese corporate giants, as has always been the widespread assumption. Like the corporation itself , Japan's graduate will need to adapt and compete more energetically than in the past. Unless of course, he can become an emperor.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "London Last Minute" program] </F>   [Text] Alberto Antonio Neto, president of the Angolan  Democratic Party, has sent a letter to U.S. State Secretary  Warren Christopher proposing the transfer of the Lusaka peace  talks to Washington, the U.S. capital. This afternoon, we asked  Alberto Neto if a greater U.S. intervention would change things.    [Begin recording] [Neto] This will change things, because  the  two warring parties cannot even produce a pin. They do not  produce rounds of ammunition to be able to continue with the war  without foreign assistance. The United States has the means to  dictate to the parties a series of solutions to end the  conflict. I think the U.S. Government, which maintains  equidistant political relations with the two parties, now  understands that presently the only solution is not to continue  with the war, but to tell the two warring parties that enough is  enough [preceding three words in English] and you have to carry  out the following conditions: First, you should respect human  rights in Angola. Second, you should end the conflict and apply  a peace plan, which could be the outcome of different peace  plans which presently exist.    [Unidentified correspondent] Alberto Neto, what exactly did  you ask the United States to do in your letter to Warren  Christopher?    [Neto] First, after the assessment [preceding word in  English], it is carrying out in political, military, economic,  and humanitarian fields, the United States should very clearly  tell the two warring parties that there is no need to continue  with this war and that it is even necessary to transfer the  ongoing Lusaka peace talks to Washington. Second, there is a  need for the presence of the unarmed parties at the negotiating  table. Third, there is a need to send a firm ultimatum to Jose  Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas Malheiro Savimbi to go to  Washington to sign the agreements which they say are almost  concluded.

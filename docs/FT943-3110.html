			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: Foster's sale lifts KLM's Northwest holding to 25% KLM Royal Dutch Airlines yesterday agreed to increase its stake in Northwest Airlines, the fourth largest US carrier, to 25 per cent from 20 per cent by buying a 5 per cent stake from Foster's Brewing, the Australian beer group. The ADollars 242m (USDollars 180m) share purchase will take KLM's holding in Northwest to the maximum level allowed. Under US law, foreign companies are not permitted to own more than 25 per cent of the voting stock of US airlines. Foster's decision to sell its stake is in line with its policy of disposing of non-core assets to reduce its substantial debts. The company's investment in Northwest represented the largest remaining non-core asset in its portfolio. KLM said it had taken the opportunity to buy the stake because the move demonstrated its commitment to its strategic alliance with Northwest. The two carriers' combined operations link170 North American cities with more than 85 cities in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Northwest welcomed the move, saying it reflected KLM's 'strong belief in Northwest's prospects for the future'. KLM's move comes at a time when other cross-border airline alliances, such as that between British Airways and USAir, have proved troublesome. KLM, however, appears to have been relatively lucky with its US investment: Northwest recently returned to profitability after coming close to bankruptcy last year. Foster's acquired its stake in Northwest in 1989 when the US carrier was the subject of an USDollars 3.65bn leveraged buy-out by an investment consortium put together by Mr Alfred Checchi, a former Disney executive, and his partner Mr Gary Wilson. At that stage, Foster's - in the form of its predecessor company, Elders IXL  -was run by Mr John Elliott, the Melbourne-based businessman. Through its finance arm, Elders agreed to invest in the Checchi consortium, and was given board representation at Northwest when the bid was successful. Asked about Elders' involvement at the time, Mr Checchi said he and Mr Elliott had become 'close personal friends'. KLM was also a member of the Checchi investment group. Foster's said it would make an after-tax profit of around ADollars 95m on the share sale, after costs. It had not written down the value of its Northwest holding, in spite of the airline's serious financial problems in the early-1990s.</p>

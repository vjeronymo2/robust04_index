			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Arts: To the garden born - Architecture When it comes to personal creativity I am sure that the majority of the English respond to landscape design and the art of gardening much more than they do to fine art or architecture. The English are very good at gardening and, if this year's Chelsea flower show was anything to go by, they are getting better at it all the time. But gardening is one thing; it is not at all the same as garden design. Are the English today any good at garden landscape? Garden architecture was something easily comprehended by the Edwardians, like Sir Edwin Lutyens in his partnership with Gertrude Jekyll. They understood the links between the site and the house and the unifying creativity of gardening. Today, in a world where everyone is a gardener, it is fair to ask - is anyone a designer? At Chelsea the Royal Horticultural Society opens its umbrella to shelter that strange English phenomenon, 'the gardening world', which includes amateur lady designers, professional plantsmen and highly qualified horticulturalists. There is always a smattering of scientists and modicum of municipalities with dendrologists and flower arrangers lurking between the tent pegs. Much as I admire what is under the canvas of the giant marquee, it is the series of small gardens outside that concern me, as examples of the best of the garden designers' art. I was struck by two distinctive but related facts at Chelsea this year. Firstly, it is OK to be wild. To scatter the wild flower seeds liberally wherever possible appears de rigueur, with meadows replacing lawns and nature ever creeping closer to the house. Secondly, it is very much OK to be picturesque - in your garden planning and in your planting. Colours are softening, scent is back to attract the bees and butterflies, and there is much less effort by growers to produce exotic blue roses or striped daffodils. It is sophisticated, as always, to be simple. There were several examples of this school of thought. The very best was the most beautiful creation designed by Arabella Lennox-Boyd for her sponsors, The Daily Telegraph. She brought young woodland to Chelsea in the form of a grove of birches gathered around a stream. There is an island in the stream and on it stands a ruined and weathered stone tower. The woodland is planted with gunnera and arum lilies, but these relatively exotic plants grow from the naturalised planting of periwinkle, Solomon's Seal and cranesbills. There is a pleasing atmosphere of age and neglect: you are not certain what has happened; has the wood encroached upon a garden, or has a garden spread casually into the wood? There is wisteria and philadelphus almost reverting to the wild. Arabella Lennox-Boyd understands that it is possible to create a microcosm of enhanced nature as a garden. It is nature that shows us how to design a garden, and we have to understand the harmony that is possible between man and nature. I like the quotation from the Sir George Sitwell, who spent his life enhancing nature: 'As the years pass by and no rude hand disturbs the traces of her presence, nature becomes more daring.' If nature was allowed to grow gently over the remains of a Chelsea flower show, what a wonderful garden would be created] The other garden I liked at Chelsea was a great contrast to Mrs Lennox-Boyd's romantic wood. The Evening Standard commissioned a very young designer, Daniel Pearson, to design a 'contemporary London garden'. He also shares the current wish to bring wildness into the garden design equation. He achieves this by stylising nature. There is a raised circle of grass and buttercups around a small fountain. The flat roof of the house is planted with grass and wild flowers, and the outdoor table has been planted with a tablecloth of wild thyme. Pearson has a wonderful colour sense, using a palette of blue and purple plants with grey slate for the paths. But the idea of using mosaics as part of his decorative scheme has not worked: the quality of their designs is inadequate and is overwhelmed by the sheer skill and subtlety of Mr Pearson's plantings. The idea of art imitating nature was also demonstrated at Chelsea by the recreation of a part of the 1870 Pulham Rock gardens from the Rothschild's Waddesdon Manor estate in Buckinghamshire. These remarkable Victorian gardens with cliffs of artificial stone (an invention of Mr Pulham) and waterfalls are being restored at Waddesdon by Julian and Isabel Bannerman, who have brought a fragment of their work to Chelsea with the help of Clifton Landscape and Design. Again nature triumphs, although the whole thing is man made. There was one other garden designer who takes nature as her theme. Julie Toll brought sand dunes and the seaside to Chelsea with a sandy coastal garden planted with all the appropriate wild flowers. Her natural scheme again had the effect of making the more elaborate and cultivated gardens look almost vulgar. Good design is often about a return to the sources and Chelsea this year offered several examples of designers who understand this principle. Great English gardeners and landscape designers like Capability Brown and Humphry Repton understood that nature is the source and inspiration. Man's intervention has to be in harmony. This message has reached Chelsea - may it spread to all garden centres.</p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Mexico's masked guerrillas meet the mayor The 18 guerrillas wearing masks, many sporting pistols, sat in the interior of the baroque cathedral of San Cristobal de Las Casas and introduced themselves in their native Tzental, Tzotzil, Chol, Tojolabal or accented Spanish. The piece of theatre marked the opening of peace talks intended to end the two-month conflict in Chiapas launched by the Zapatista National Liberation Army which has left more than 100 dead and 20,000 refugees. Sandwiched between the guerrillas was Mr Manuel Camacho, former mayor of Mexico City and now peace commissioner in the impoverished southern state of Chiapas. He joined hands with some of the guerrillas and raised the Mexican flag, an act intended to reflect what the two sides had in common. The rebels described themselves as fully Mexican and from the state of Chiapas. They said they were part of the Clandestine Revolutionary Indigenous Committee of the Zapatistas, and as such the supreme leaders of the rebel force. Their spokesman was Sub-commander Marcos, who has achieved notoriety as the only non-Indian among the rebel leaders and their interpreter with the rest of Mexico. Wearing his black poncho and balaclava, a string of red cartridges around his shoulder, the sub-commander declared: 'My colleagues were clear in explaining to the commissioner that they did not come to seek a pardon, that they do not regret fighting for their rights, but they see that this could be the moment that in place of speaking with the rifle, the good men that form our army can speak from their heart.' Sub-commander Marcos said that the two sides spent practically all the first day reaching agreement on the agenda of peace negotiations. He said the rebels would then present their list of demands for local and national reforms. Mr Camacho recognised the guerrillas as an entirely Mexican force, predominantly indigenous and as any army of national liberation. He thus publicly ridiculed the government's former position that guerrillas were lawbreakers, led by foreigners, who manipulated their Indian followers. The show of unity between Mr Camacho and the rebels belies the difficulty of negotiations ahead. With powerful forces in the state opposed to the Zapatistas, Mr Camacho will find it difficult to make significant concessions.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria May 6 SAPA -- The National Party on Friday  [6 May] announced that Mr F W de Klerk has been elected  executive deputy president, according to the constitutional  provisions allowing for such a position.    "Mr de Klerk will serve in this position in his own right  and  because he represents millions of South Africans of all  population groups," an NP congratulatory statement from Pretoria  said.    "Mr de Klerk is eminently suited to play a reconciliatory  role in the Government of National Unity," the statement added.    Earlier on Friday, the African National Congress announced  its national chairman, Mr Thabo Mbeki, would serve as first  deputy president.    Both men will serve under president-designate Nelson  Mandela.</p>

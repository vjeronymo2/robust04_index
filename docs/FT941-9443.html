			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Management (The Growing Business): European adventure - Signs that Britain's 3i is preparing for a stock market flotation Last month Passport Modevertrieb GmbH helped to launch a new adventure for 3i. The Stuttgart-based maker of ladies' knitwear became the first company to receive equity from a Ecu 300m fund that 3i has raised for investment in continental Europe's unquoted companies. Important as the deal was to Passport Modevertrieb's owners, the investment has a wider significance for 3i. The European fund is a departure for the 45-year-old institution in the sense that it is the first time it has raised money to manage for other investors. It also signals a desire by 3i to accelerate its expansion in the less developed and growing continental European venture capital market. But, most intriguingly, it appears to put in place one of the last elements necessary to prepare the UK's largest venture capital company for a stock market flotation. The fees 3i will receive for managing the new fund will boost the profit and loss account, while the fund approach will allow expansion without undue pressure on the group's balance sheet. The fund's launch also comes at a time when venture capital investment trust shares, against which 3i would be compared, are trading at a historically low discount to net asset values. 3i and its advisers deny the new fund was raised with any thought to relaunching last year's hastily abandoned flotation. The group's shareholders - the UK clearing banks and the Bank of England - may yet decide they do not want to sell. But even if 3i remains unquoted, its move into fund management is significant on two counts. Until now 3i has always invested off the strength of its own balance sheet, unlike many UK venture capital providers which periodically raise funds to manage for other investors. That has now changed. Neil Cross, 3i's international director, makes it clear the raising of a fund is not a one-off event. Depending on how successfully 3i invests the first fund, the group could be back raising more capital within two years. What is more, 3i does not rule out raising funds for investment elsewhere, including the UK. 'We wanted to make a strategic development for the group into fund management,' says Cross. 'I felt strategically it gave me a more assured flexibility and it was a business 3i should be in.' 3i's move into managing other people's unquoted investment portfolios could add to competition among venture capital companies for new funds. Some UK institutions are already showing a reluctance to invest more in new funds and the arrival of a group with 3i's reputation may be less than welcome, particularly to the smaller venture capital providers. Others disagree. Ronald Cohen, chairman of Apax Ventures, who is currently in the US raising a new fund, says the supply of funds is not 'finite' and a good record will always attract investors. From the point of view of private equity investment in continental Europe, 3i's move also signals a more aggressive approach, though not without risks. The group already makes 25 per cent of its equity investments on the continent each year. But this market is greatly underdeveloped by UK standards. In France, the market that is closest behind the UK, penetration of investment capital as a proportion of GDP is barely more than a third of the level of 3i's domestic market. Italy, Germany and Spain, where 3i will also invest, are even less well developed. But once the economies in these countries improve, the market for unquoted investments could rapidly expand, says Paul Waller, 3i's European director. Companies like Passport Modevertrieb are likely to provide this growth. For 20 years, the company has been conservatively and profitably run. Then, like thousands of other German companies, it ran into the issue of how to secure succession as the founders moved towards retirement. Wanting to maintain its independence, the owners turned to 3i to back a management buy-out that left the founders with a substantial minority stake. The succession issue is facing family-owned companies throughout continental Europe. 'There are 15,000 family businesses that have to manage their succession over the next 10 years so there is a massive market to tap into,' says Thomas Schlytter-Henrichsen, managing director of 3i, Germany. 'We see the opportunity to buy from large groups that are divesting of subsidiaries and may have sales of DM200m-DM300m (Pounds 77m-Pounds 116m).' But some venture capitalists say the continental European market is not as developed as the UK for good reason. 'Europe is higher risk as well as higher growth and higher reward,' says one UK-based venture capital supplier. 'Motivation in Germany is different,' he says. 'Managers there have been more interested in a large secure salary and a big position rather than capital gain. Go to Italy and Spain and you don't know what books you are looking at, while in France the Brits don't go down too well.' Others believe 3i is hedging its bets in continental Europe by 'investing other people's money'. 3i denies this and says the fund will allow it to double the average size of transaction and will increase its ability to underwrite deals. But why raise the fund now, if the group's capital base is not yet constraining growth? The industry is convinced 3i is preparing for flotation and a closer look at 3i's funding supports this. 3i's investments in Europe will mostly be in the form of equity for management buy-outs and buy-ins. They will bring 3i a relatively low annual running yield - or return, from various forms of dividends. By contrast, 3i's UK investments include a substantial number of loans in addition to equity investments, which means the running yield is higher. A rapid expansion in continental European investment off its own balance sheet could lead to a gap between the cost of 3i's bank borrowings and the lower revenue from the relatively low running yield on continental investments. The profit and loss account might then suffer. By expanding in Europe through a fund, 3i will be protecting its profit and loss account. That way lies the route to a dividend large enough to support the kind of valuation 3i's shareholders might want before floating the group.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- VENTURING INTO EUROPE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Annual venture capital investment Ecu bn*               1987     1988     1989     1990     1991     1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK                     1.6      1.9      2.3      1.9      1.6      1.8 France                 0.4      0.7      0.9      0.8      1.0      1.0 Germany                0.1      0.1      0.2      0.6      0.6      0.6 Spain                  0.1      0.1      0.1      0.1      0.2      0.1 Italy                  0.1      0.2      0.2      0.2      0.5      0.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                  2.3      3.0      3.8      3.6      3.9      4.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * converted from local currency at 1992 average EVCA exchange rate  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: EVCA/Initiative Europe  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Arts: Truly festive wonder - Poetry in performance ACCORDING TO Simon Armitage, the young poet from Huddersfield who was the opening reader at last week's St Andrews Poetry Festival, it is the smell of the cabbage that they remember best, those ex-prisoners from Strangeways. And the brutal, hammering rhythms of 'D821 Remembers Strangeways', a grim litany of defiance, hopelessness and sheer verbal aggression in which 'and the smell of the cabbage' was repeated over and over again until the audience began to loathe the stuff brought out Armitage's best qualities as poet and performer. He hammers away at our genteel presuppositions about the nature and purpose of poetry like a street lout with a lump hammer inside his jacket. After swallowing hard on all that northern grit, it came as something of a surprise to rediscover that poetry needn't after all be abrasively social-realist if it is to be honest. The Scots poet John Dixon, a tall, cravated, cherubic-cheeked lawyer by profession, let his sequence of new poems speak for themselves - other than to remind us that poetry was essentially a spiritual thing 'like love, music and, of course, God himself'. We were then treated to a stream of beautifully articulated, hastily read pseudo-narratives of metaphysical bewilderment, somewhat in the Ashbery mode. Occasionally, the voice would rise to a higher, more dreamy, register, transubstantiating the poem into wispy, smoke-like things. 'It's that line of light on the horizon,' he explained before reading his last poem, 'That Point where the Sun meets the Sky - as on the West Coast of Scotland. That's what poetry always looks for.' Younger poets like Armitage and Dixon come to poetry festivals bearing sheafs of paper and what they read is new, aggressively new. The future is racing ahead of them. The older ones clutch well-rubbed, well-annotated copies of published books to their chests as a clergyman might clutch his bible, and for much the same reason: it is armour against the world; the real, tangible proof that one has laboured to some end. They count themselves lucky to be writing six poems a year. Life and creativity are slipping away. Which is why, on the second evening of the festival, I was shocked to see the poet Hugo Williams, a tall, fairly handsome man in his forties, slipping sideways into the St Leonards School Music Room with a blue Simplex folder. Until, that is, he began to shake those dog-eared copies out . . . Himself the son of an actor, Williams reads his poems in a rather languid fashion as if it were the Rotherham Playhouse tonight and he was mindful of the need to save himself for Saturday night's big push at the Bradford Alhambra. He is quite obsessed by the minutiae of his own autobiography - to such a degree that we see the schoolboy petulance, the boyish anxieties written in his face as he reads, with a slight stammer, poems about the difficulties (and the exhilarations) of living with an imperious, peripatetic actor-playwright father. Many of the poems he read were little versified letters that dealt with the petty, stinging humiliations of adolescence. No matter how tall one grows, one is still apt to be caught with one's trousers down. The festival concluded with a reading by two established voices from England, Craig Raine, sometime chief of the Martians, and James Fenton, poet and foreign correspondent extraordinary. Raine, looking mildly piratical in a flamboyant red shirt, and densely bearded as ever, was in a ponderous, meticulous mood, picking his way through poems clotted with metaphor upon brilliant, tricksy metaphor. Every word had the high polish of a conker. And as Raine read, Fenton sat, slumped forward in his chair, looking heavy and lugubrious, his large, bald, egg-shaped head held quite fiercely between his hands like Humpty Dumpty contemplating the disaster of himself. Who would have guessed that when he stood up to read he would actually make the audience laugh with a marvellous selection of rollicking ballads, all stuff and meaningful nonsense, like some latter-day knees-slapping Edward Lear? It was a moment of truly festive wonder.</p>

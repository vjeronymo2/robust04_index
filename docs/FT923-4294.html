			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Faith in City churches faces a financial test - Alan Pike considers the challenge posed by empty pews A YEAR ago a building-site crane collapsed through the roof of the Wren church of St James Garlickhythe in the City of London, uncannily following the path of a Second World War bomb. Therefore painstaking restoration work had to start yet again. Neither cranes nor bombs have managed to destroy St James and nearly 40 other famous churches in the Square Mile. The churches may, however, prove less resistant to a modest document produced by Dr David Hope, bishop of London, on the future of the Church of England in the diocese. Some of Dr Hope's Victorian predecessors are remembered for the many new churches they opened in the diocese. Dr Hope's term will almost certainly lead to church closures, the result of shifts in population, fewer worshippers and cost pressures. There are, he says, 'too many church buildings for our needs either now or into the future'. This assessment - true in many parts of the country - is uniquely valid in the City where, in addition to St Paul's Cathedral, there is a church for about every 100 members of the tiny resident population. Fewer than 5,000 people live in the City today compared with well over 100,000 in the middle of the last century. The Church of England is no more immune from recessionary and financial pressures than commercial organisations. The Church Commissioners, who are responsible for the church's main investments, have warned that the proportion of clergy stipends met from investment income will decline from 45 per cent to as little as 30 per cent by 1995. They foresee little growth in their investment income, while other costs such as clergy pensions are expected to rise. Dr Hope wants to make the London diocese, which has an annual bill for clergy pay of Pounds 7.5m, capable of paying stipends without any support from the Church Commissioners. Where a parish is unable to contribute adequately to the funding process there should, he says, be an assessment of its future. It might become part of a 'larger unit' or, if it is carrying out important work, be designated a mission area with special support from central funds. The bishop's strategy document proposes a survey of all churches in the diocese, leading to decisions on how many and which buildings are needed. Decisions on church closures are often controversial. Proposals in the Liverpool diocese to reduce the number of inner-city parishes and close seven churches have provoked an outcry. The diocese of London faces a particularly delicate task with the historically and architecturally famous City churches. Dr Hope has asked Lord Templeman, a law lord, to chair a diocesan commission on the City churches. A judge is an apt choice: there is little argument about the architectural merits of the churches - the issue is one of judgment about their future viability. If the Church of England's present needs were the only factor taken into account by the commission, it would be easy for it to conclude that the Square Mile contains about three dozen churches surplus to requirements. The population of 5,000 is scarcely enough to justify a single Anglican parish church elsewhere in the country. While they minister to the City's huge weekday working population, many of the churches do not hold Sunday services and lack regular congregations. Frequently well-endowed by ancient charitable foundations, their incumbents attract uncharitable comments from fellow clergy for being protected from the reality of modern church life. None of this, however, helps to determine what should happen to the buildings, which include the handful of medieval City churches that survived the Great Fire of London in 1666, and the equally small handful of Wren churches to have survived the Blitz intact. The Church Commissioners will make the final decisions on the future of Anglican buildings that are no longer needed. Since 1969, decisions have been reached on 1,317 churches. Some 55 per cent have been converted to alternative use, such as low-cost housing and art centres. A further 23 per cent have been demolished and 22 per cent preserved in their existing form with financial support from the Redundant Churches Fund, financed jointly by the Church and the government. Whatever ideas the commission produces for the City churches, it is unlikely to regard the crane at St James Garlickhythe as a divinely-inspired hint and propose knocking them down. Dr Hope's Victorian predecessors had fewer scruples. Some 20 City churches were demolished during the second half of the 19th-century, either to make way for new buildings or simply because they had become surplus to requirements. Most of them, like the surviving City churches, were architectural glories built by Wren after the Great Fire.</p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Leading Article: The choice that Russia needs 'YELTSIN HEADS for showdown with Congress,' proclaimed an FT headline just after Russia's president had won a convincing endorsement in last April's referendum. Four months on, the showdown is still awaited. Mr Boris Yeltsin and his parliamentary opponents continue their war of laws, decrees and corruption charges. His government is paralysed by faction-fighting. Power and money seep away from the centre to the regions, economic output declines, and Russians sink further into cynicism about their rulers. Without a decisive move to break these logjams, the point can not be far off when political drift turns into serious political danger. Now President Yeltsin says he is at last about to make such a move: he plans to outflank congressional diehards by forcing early parliamentary elections this autumn. Congress will be asked to dissolve itself in order to allow the creation of a new assembly. If, as seems certain, it refuses, Mr Yeltsin will press ahead anyway. In one bound, he will be free to govern as mandated; reform will be back on course; and a new parliament empowered to join in the creation of a more stable constitutional order. It would clearly be beneficial, both for Mr Yeltsin and for the cause of reform, to get rid of a parliament that dates back to communism and which has consistently passed Soviet-era legislation - most recently a budget that amounts to a recipe for hyperinflation and a law that attempts to halt Russia's privatisation programme. Ample opportunities But there are several problems with that optimistic scenario. One is that we have heard it too many times before. In the two years since he led Russia from the wreckage of the former Soviet Union, Mr Yeltsin has had ample opportunities either to reform or defeat the parliament, notably immediately after the dissolution of the USSR. On each occasion, he has ducked, weaved and temporised, allowing his opponents time to counter-attack. A second difficulty is posed by the effort to create a new constitution out of the old. The present constitution is a hopeless mess: it has been amended so many times by the current parliament as to be unrecognisable, and can now be used by Mr Yeltsin's opponents to mean almost whatever they want it to mean. Creating a new one confronted Mr Yeltsin with a near-impossible dilemma. To get away with violating the law in pursuit of a better one, he needed to shore up his power base in Moscow and build a coalition of regional and republican leaders that would support him in his confrontation with parliament. This he has been trying to do over the past four months - but at the cost of a devolution of powers to the republics and regions that, if continued, would call in question the very survival of the Russian federation. As a result, he is so weakened that his latest manoeuvre seems more likely to deepen the confusion than to advance democracy. Policy stalemate This points to the third, and most important, difficulty for those - like the Group of Seven - who have pinned their hopes for reform on Mr Yeltsin: on the evidence of recent months, he seems most unlikely to deliver. It is now abundantly clear that Russia's policy stalemate is not simply a matter of president versus parliament, or reformist ministers versus recalcitrant central bank; it is a paralysis at the heart of the cabinet and presidential entourage. The cabinet is both divided and incompetent, as shown by the rouble reform fiasco last month; the reformers who once, briefly, seemed to act as a government within the government are fighting among themselves; and Mr Yeltsin seems powerless, or unwilling, to inject greater coherence into the business of government that goes on in his name. It is hard to see how a few more months of parliamentary electioneering alone will resolve that problem. If there are to be elections, they would more sensibly be for both parliament and president. Such a contest would give Mr Yeltsin - still held in some esteem around the country - a chance to spell out what he stands for. If he did so with sufficient vigour and clarity he would have a good chance of being re-elected. If not, the alternative would not necessarily be a disaster.</p>

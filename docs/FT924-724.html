			<p>921222 FT  22 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Corporate gloom fails to dent optimistic mood A SPATE of bad corporate news, both in Europe and the US, failed to leave a negative impression on the FT-Actuaries World Index last week, and there were some strong performances, from Ireland and Singapore in particular. The World index gained 1.6 per cent in local currency terms. Even IBM's announcement of job cuts and a decision to take a Dollars 6bn fourth-quarter charge to cover a restructuring programme, leaving the stock at an 11-year low by the weekend, failed to dent sentiment in the US. Instead, the talk at the round of pre-Christmas parties concentrated on the US economic recovery, and even President-elect Bill Clinton's 'phone-in' on the state of the nation could not stifle the mood of optimism. Ireland came to the fore last week with a 5.8 per cent rise on sustained expectations of a currency devaluation. Over the last quarter, the market has risen some 7 per cent in local currency terms, compared with 0.8 per cent in Germany and 1 per cent in France, but is 12 per cent down since the start of the year. Elsewhere in Europe, Sweden was a feature, helped by lower domestic interest rates and a stronger dollar. Other Nordic markets lost ground, mainly on year-end profit-taking. Austria showed up as one of the week's worst performers following Creditanstalt's warning that it planned a 6 per cent cut in its 1992 dividend, and a heavy fall in the share price of OMV, mainly on selling by foreign institutions. Oil issues in general had a dismal week, with Petrofina contributing largely to Belgium's negative showing after news last Monday that the company would be cutting its dividend by 50 per cent. In France, speculation that the franc would be devalued put pressure on the market. Among the Far Eastern markets, Singapore stood out as Hong Kong again suffered from the 'China effect', this time as its neighbour launched a thinly disguised attack on the Jardine Matheson Group. Most analysts believe that Hong Kong will remain a volatile market right up to the Legco vote in early February. Institutional investors have consequently switched some of their funds away from Hong Kong to other markets in the region, with Singapore seeing some benefit. According to Kim Eng Securities, Singapore looks poised for a sustained rally in 1993, particularly if the government decides to reduce corporate tax significantly in the spring budget.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                          EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER                   Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse               Aug        Sep        Oct        Nov       US                     1992       1992       1992       1992   Dollars bn  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium            41.38      42.76      47.56      43.93     1.34 France             64.52     134.26     108.08      92.39    17.07 Germany           101.72     109.19      98.85      92.20    57.84 Italy           6,039.60  10,808.00  17,112.00  24,248.80    17.40 Netherlands         9.80      14.41      14.00      11.70     6.53 Spain             317.47     578.78     687.70     619.31     5.12 Switzerland         9.01      13.40      11.78      11.60     8.07 UK                 26.68      45.30      39.76      39.57    59.82  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Italian data adjusted to include off-market trading.

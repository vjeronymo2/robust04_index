			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RENAISSANCE MAN;  </P> <P> GRADUATE GETS FELLOWSHIP TO LEARN ART OF MAKING BAROQUE HORN  </P> <P> The Thomas J. Watson Foundation is paying Doug Dunston $13,000 to get out of  town.  </P> <P> Way out of town.  </P> <P> Basel, Switzerland, to be exact, where Dunston plans to spend a year learning  the ancient art of trumpet making and living on "bread, beer and chocolate."  </P> <P> Dunston, 21, was recently graduated from Harvey Mudd College in Claremont with  a degree in physics. Although he plans eventually to seek a Ph.D. in the  subject, the Watson fellowship will give him a chance to to do something  "totally out of the mainstream," Dunston said.  </P> <P> He has obtained an unpaid apprenticeship in the Basel workshop of Rainer Egger,  who works with a four-person staff to painstakingly handcraft fewer than 20  baroque trumpets each year.  </P> <P> Dunston, a native of Glenview, Ill., said his world travels so far have taken  him as far as, well, Tijuana.  </P> <P> He said he doesn't know what to expect from his year abroad. Egger has found  him an apartment near the shop, and Dunston has been taking intensive classes  in German so that he can communicate with his new employer when he starts work  Sept. 1.  </P> <P> "I can't imagine how it's going to be," Dunston said. "But I'm ready to accept  whatever Europe throws my way."  </P> <P> The Watson fellowship program, founded in 1968, supports independent foreign  research and travel for recent graduates of 55 private colleges and  universities around the nation. Candidates must be nominated by their schools.  Dunston is one of 76 graduating seniors, including six from San Gabriel Valley  colleges, to be selected this year.  </P> <P> "He is a very dynamic young man," said Steven Licata, executive director of the  Watson Foundation, with headquarters in Providence, R.I. "He is creative and  personable. . . . You're instantly impressed by him."  </P> <P> The goal of the fellowship, Licata said, is to create a Wanderjahr -- a year to  wander and explore.  </P> <P> "The proposal has to be something that is personally relevant, not necessarily  unusual," Licata said.  </P> <P> "Basically, they give you $13,000 to get out of the country for a year,"  deadpanned Dunston, who has been playing brass instruments since he was in the  fourth grade. During his four years at Harvey Mudd, he played in the Claremont  Chamber Orchestra and the Pomona Symphony.  </P> <P> "I remember my first concert. I was so excited," Dunston recalled of his  elementary school debut. "I played really harsh and loud, but I played the  blues. . . . What a great feeling."  </P> <P> Dunston said he has a particular affinity for the baroque trumpet -- a long,  straight tube with a "magical air about it" used primarily in Renaissance and  baroque music.  </P> <P> Although not widely played since the invention of valve trumpets in 1813,  baroque trumpets are regaining popularity among musicians who want to capture  the original sound.  </P> <P> "There is a lot of life in these instruments," Dunston said. "It's such a great  feeling to play Mozart or Bach on the same instrument that was used then."  </P> <P> Dunston's plan for his Wanderjahr is one of the most lighthearted of the  proposals submitted by 1990 Watson Fellowship recipients from San Gabriel  Valley colleges.  </P> <P> The other local fellows are Chris Billingham of Scripps College, who will  travel to Sweden, Norway and Australia to study leadership roles of women in  business; Jennifer Finlay of Pitzer College, who will study the roles of ethnic  Chinese women in Singapore and Malaysia; Laurie Guggenheim of Pomona College,  who will study the sociology of deaf communities in France, Germany and  England; Jennifer Ann Low of Caltech, who will study the epidemiology and  sociology of AIDS in Rwanda, Zaire and Belgium, and Ivan Svitek of Claremont  McKenna College, who will study East European refugee camps in Austria, England  and Germany.  </P> <P> "The project isn't the most important thing," said Margo Berman, a member of  the Watson selection committee at Harvey Mudd College and a former recipient of  the fellowship. "The greatest benefit is the increased sense of independence  that you get.  </P> <P> "You're not going to be in a university setting, where everything is planned on  schedule. . . . You're going to be completely on your own, learning to survive  in a new country."  </P> <P> Still, Dunston does have one particular goal in mind -- a project that will  combine his musical and scientific talents. In Switzerland, he hopes to design  for himself a "very unique trumpet" that will be "a symphony in itself."  </P></p>

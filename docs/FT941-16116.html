			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Flooding alerts reduced in south The National Rivers Authority yesterday reduced most of its flooding alerts in the south as the heavy rains of the past 10 days eased off. However a red alert - the highest danger signal - was kept on the River Lavant in the city of Chichester as the operation to pump water from the flood-hit county capital of West Sussex continued around the clock. It rained only moderately in the city, but the river level rose because of water draining off the Downs. The measure the authority uses to gauge the risk to the city is the height of water at the one-metre weir at Grayling Well, north of the city. At one stage the water rose to 0.934 metres which precipitated flooding in the east of the city. It fell to 0.834 metres early yesterday only to rise to 0.884 metres yesterday evening. At this level it constitutes no danger to Chichester but the fear is that with further rain forecast for the rest of the week, and a spring tide, which could push water up the river from the sea, the Lavant could again burst its banks and flood eastern Chichester. Already 12 families have been evacuated from this area, a number of shops have reported flooded basements, and schools have been closed. The eastern part of Chichester is being shored up with sandbag dykes. Another worry is that the culvert under the city will be unable to take the volume of water flowing from the Lavant and will burst, flooding the city centre. To avoid this, pipes along the main streets in the middle of the city are draining off 8m gallons of water a day. This represents several inches of water from the river but may not be enough if there is more heavy rain. The army is building Bailey bridges in the east of the city to open up the A27 route to Brighton. Weather, Page 26</p>

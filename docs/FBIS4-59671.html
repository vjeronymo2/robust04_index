			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, May 17 (AFP) -- Northern Yemeni troops Monday  [16 May] took the rival south's main air base at al-'Anad,  opening the way for a push towards the southern capital Aden,  some 50 kilometres (30 miles) to the south, an AFP photographer  on the spot said.    As the northern soldiers consolidated, opposition parties  led  by vice-president 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the southern leader,  announced here early Tuesday they would form a High Council for  National Salvation.    'Abd-al Rahman al-Jifri, who chairs a bloc of five  opposition  parties, told AFP the council would function wherever it had  influence, not just in southern Yemen.    "In no way does this mean the formation of a government of  South Yemen," al-Jifri said.    He said the decision to form a High Council was prompted by  the constitutional vacuum and the illegality of the political  institutions in the country.    Around 50 northerners were patrolling the perimeter of the  al-'Anad air base Monday and the junction of the two main roads  to the northern capital Sanaa, an AFP photographer said.    Backed by tanks, artillery and anti-aircraft batteries, they  took up position around 3:30 p.m. (1230 GMT), cutting off  southern troops further north.    The official north Yemeni news agency SABA' reported Monday  afternoon that the base had fallen to northern troops, who were  mopping up resistance inside the base.    Southern warplanes were bombing newly-won northern  positions,  defying anti-aircraft fire.    Al-Jifri implicitly recognised that the base, garrisoned by  20,000 men, had fallen, saying that its weaponry had been  removed.    "The northerners knew all the military and artillery  positions inside the base, so it was only natural that we took  out the heavy artillery to hide it elsewhere," he said.    The base appeared deserted Monday evening, but heavy  fighting  was going on in the surrounding hills.    The AFP photographer at the base said the gun turrets on the  northerners' tanks were turned towards the south.    Asked if they had come from Aden or Sanaa, the soldiers  replied joyously: "Sanaa."    Some five kilometres separated the northern troops and the  southern army, which was bringing up heavy artillery and  pounding northerners' positions.    Truckloads of civilians were fleeing in panic either towards  Aden or to the mountains in the north.    The northern army has been concentrating its efforts on the  strategic route for the past few days.    Heavy fighting was also reported on the eastern front some  40  kilometres (24 miles) from Aden, and journalists trying to get  there were sent back by southern troops.    Warplanes were continuously landing and taking off from Aden  throughout Monday evening, but the local population remained  calm.    The two sides lurched into civil war on May 5 after months  of  arguing over how to run the country, formed from the unification  in May 1990 of conservative North Yemen and poorer, Marxist  South Yemen.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Drumming up interest in Sakhalin crude - A fresh tender is to be held for foreign operators THE RUSSIAN Government has announced the second tender in two years inviting foreign companies to develop offshore oil and gas fields on the continental shelf of the far eastern island of Sakhalin. The committee organising the tender, chaired by the academician Mr Farmen Salmanov, held its first meeting in Moscow on April 19. The Russian authorities plan to hold up to five more tenders in the vicinity over the next few years, holding out the possibility of the Sakhalin waters becoming one of the largest offshore oil and gas regions in the world. The second Sakhalin tender will cover fields with confirmed deposits and other areas where little geological data is available, in 23,000 square km (8,880 square miles) in the Sea of Okhotsk, east of Sakhalin, and 17,000 sq km in and around the Bay of Sakhalin in the North West of the island. In May last year the MMM consortium consisting of Marathon Oil Company, McDermott International, and Mitsui &amp; Company emerged as eventual winners in a tender contested by six groups of international companies. The consortium is now known as MMMMS, having been enlarged to include Royal Dutch Shell and Mitsubishi Corporation. Since winning the tender, MMMMS has spent Dollars 80m on a feasibility study of the Lunskoye and Piltun-Astokhskoye fields, which have combined reserves of 400bn cubic metres of gas and 730m barrels of oil. The consortium is now negotiating with representatives of the Russian Government in Houston, Texas, about details of the deal, including profit sharing. Development costs will be in the region of Dollars 10bn making it the biggest foreign investment under discussion in Russia. One factor absent from the second tender will be the forceful personality of the former Governor of Sakhalin, Mr Valentin Fyodorov, who almost single-handedly took on the Russian government in June 1992 when he refused to acknowledge MMM as the winning consortium. His intervention led to a highly publicised struggle between Sakhalin and Moscow over which side owned the rights to the natural resources of the continental shelf. President Yeltsin named a new governor of Sakhalin, Mr Evgeny Krasnoyarov, on April 8 following a virulent campaign by the local soviet to remove the former governor. Mr Keith Holmes, general manager of Shell Development Sakhalin said: 'Fyodorov fought hard to get extra benefits for the island and took on the might of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy and the Moscow access that leads to. But as a direct consequence of his actions the project is probably a year behind schedule.' The administration of Sakhalin now appears to acknowledge the priority rights of Moscow. According to Mr Nikolai Arsenyev, vice governor of Sakhalin: 'Unfortunately we are not in the same position as Alaska, where all the natural resources belong to the local state.' The Russian authorities hope to raise the profitability of future developments by sharing infrastructure costs among the various projects. But some foreign oilmen are doubtful about the feasibility of such an arrangement. 'Shell would not want to build a pipe line big enough to carry gas from future projects, even if they later turned out to be ours,' Mr Holmes said. 'If Shell knew 25 years ago what it knows now about the North Sea it might have achieved optimal efficiency. But life is not like that.' Ground rules for the new tender will be announced as soon as the final deal with MMMMS is signed - which may be as early as June. Presentations are expected to be held in Sakhalin and Houston, Texas, and packets of geological information will be sold to interested companies. Mr Peter Sadovnik, chairman of the Sakhalin Regional Committee of Geology and Mineral Resources, refused to indicate what the possible scale of recoverable reserves might be. 'All the areas look promising, or we would not be holding a tender,' he said. He said that the tender zone would be divided into several blocks with varying quality of data, ranging from those where deep drilling had taken place to others where no preparation for drilling had been done. Russian oil companies have made exploratory drilling of two fields inside the tender zone Kirinskaya, which contains mostly gas deposits, and Arkutunskoye, which contains mostly oil. The fields covered by the MMMMS negotiations are in the region of the tender zone, but will be excluded from the tender. The Japanese State owned Sakhalin Oil Development Company (Sodeco) holds development rights for the Chaivo and Odoptufields under an agreement signed in 1975. A Dollars 277m feasibility study of the fields carried out by Sodeco in 1976 concluded that further development would not be economical under the conditions of the time.</p>

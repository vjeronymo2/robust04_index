			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, May 29 (XINHUA) -- Tianjin, a leading port  city and manufacturing center in north China, is becoming the  largest financial center in the area.    Shi Jiliang, governor of the Tianjin branch of the People's  Bank of China, the country's central bank, said that money  raised in the Tianjin financial market amounted to 36.6 billion  yuan in 1993, next only to the financial market in Shanghai.    He said that Tianjin ranks second among the eight largest  financial markets in China -- Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing,  Guangzhou, Xian, Chongqing, Wuhan and Shenyang.    Tianjin currently has 1,598 financial institutions,  including  1,048 banks, employing a total of 34,000 people.    Governor Shi described the financial sector as a "driving  force" behind Tianjin's economic growth.    "Tianjin's financial sector has continued its strong growth  since the beginning of this year," he said.    For example, banks in the city took in 65 billion yuan in  savings deposits and extended 80 billion yuan in loans in the  first four months of 1994.    Shi said that the rapid growth of the financial sector was  due primarily to the reform of the financial system over the  past few years.    As a result, Tianjin has introduced a new financial system,  with the state-owned banks as the mainstay, and non-banking  institutions and foreign banks as the subsidiary.    The system also consists of an inter-bank borrowing and  lending market, a securities market and a foreign exchange swap  market.    To date, financial institutions in other parts of China have  set up 38 subsidiaries in Tianjin, Shi said.    Since October 1992 banks from Britain, France and the United  States have opened 12 branches in Tianjin, he added.    The Tianjin securities trading center now has 300 trading  seats, three trading halls and 213 members, he said, adding that  5.6 billion worth of treasury bonds changed hands there in the  first quarter of 1994.    "The foreign exchange market in Tianjin is brisk, too," Shi  said.    In the first four months of this year, about 500 million  U.S.  dollars changed hands in the Tianjin foreign exchange swap  center, providing an impetus to the growth of foreign-funded  firms and export-led companies, he said.    Speaking of the financial reform, Shi Jiliang said that it  is  imperative to improve macro-economic control means and the  financial market, and introduce an efficient operational system  in specialized state-owned banks.    To this end, existing specialized banks will be turned into  commercial banks, a financial supervisory system instituted and  intermediate financial agencies established, he said.    He also revealed that Tianjin plans to open the country's  third stock exchange in the future, after Shanghai and Shenzhen.</p>

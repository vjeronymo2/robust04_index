			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL IS A BUMMER  </P> <P> The first day of school is rough on mothers -- especially the young ones who  are saying goodby to an era. I dropped in on Jean Carp to hold her hand and  reassure her that everyone would survive the day.  </P> <P> "Did you get Kenny off to school?" I asked.  </P> <P> "Yes, finally," she groaned, pouring herself a cup of coffee.  </P> <P> "What happened?"  </P> <P> "He didn't want to go."  </P> <P> "You're kidding."  </P> <P> "No, he said the kids wouldn't like him."  </P> <P> "Didn't you tell him how ridiculous that was?"  </P> <P> "Yes, I told him how during the summer he had made a lot of friends. Then he  said his teachers had it in for him."  </P> <P> "Why would he say a thing like that when he doesn't even know them yet?"  </P> <P> "I don't know. I almost got him out of the door when he came back and changed  his clothes for the third time. Said his belt was too wide and his shoes too  clean."  </P> <P> "Oh, good grief."  </P> <P> "That's when he slumped down into a chair and said, 'I'll never find the  restroom or the cafeteria. I'm surely not going to ask someone.' "  </P> <P> "What did you tell him?"  </P> <P> "I told him I'd put a note in his pocket with B-O-Y-S printed on it and pack  his lunch."  </P> <P> "Did that do it?"  </P> <P> "Nope. He wanted to know how many days he had to put in until Christmas  vacation."  </P> <P> "What an attitude," I said, shaking my head.  </P> <P> "He got out to the driveway. Then he came back in again and said, 'Why do I  have to go to school anyway? Why can't I just stay home and help you? I could  run errands and take out the garbage and watch the baby for you when you go to  the dentist.' Can you believe he actually offered to get a regular job?"  </P> <P> "Incredible."  </P> <P> "I really felt sorry for him, though," said Jean. "When I watched him walk down  the street clutching his lunch bag and hanging onto those pitiful few books and  a new pencil, I wanted to call him back. But when a man is 44 years old and the  new principal, he has no choice."  </P> <P> I shook my head. "Don't be surprised if he bolts at lunch."  </P></p>

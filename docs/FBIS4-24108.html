			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] Good evening! In Lusaka, there is much expectation  on the debate regarding the installation of the National Union  for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] and its high  officials. Despite the fact that their differences have been  narrowed, the government and UNITA negotiators are still meeting  alone in the search for a solution for accommodations for Jonas  Savimbi's organization and its senior leaders. This afternoon's  meeting began at 1700 and has not yet been concluded. That is  why there is great expectation about the meeting. We may give  more details about the meeting soon.    Meanwhile, UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye  and  members of the troika of observers are ready to leave for Cape  Town, South Africa. They will leave the Zambian capital early  morning tomorrow. In South Africa, the special representative  of the UN secretary general in Angola and his team will request  assistance from President Nelson Mandela with the Angolan peace  talks, taking advantage of his influence and the prestige  enjoyed by the new president of that country.</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / UN envoy likely to urge troops for Somalia THE United Nations special representative in Somalia is expected to recommend that troops should be sent to protect relief operations in the war-shattered country, with or without the agreement of the warring factions. A potentially far-reaching UN precedent would be established should the Security Council act on the recommendation and decide that humanitarian considerations override claims of sovereignty made by fighting warlords. The size of the force has yet to be agreed but UN Ambassador Mohamed Sahnoun has concluded that it is now essential to send at least a limited military presence to Somalia to avert tens of thousands of deaths from starvation. The shift in UN attitudes came as Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, arrived in Mogadishu yesterday for a three-day assessment visit. Unicef, the UN children's agency, also said yesterday it had airlifted emergency medical supplies to four towns where malnutrition rates among children were 80 per cent and up to 15 children were dying in each town every day. Mr Sahnoun has said that at least 7,000 armed UN guards must be dispatched urgently to protect and escort relief personnel and food convoys. Without the approval of all sides, a limited military intervention with purely humanitarian objectives is now envisaged to secure the international airport and port in Mogadishu and to establish some safe relief corridors. A UN team now in Somalia investigating how to get better security for an expanded relief effort is due to report to the secretary general by the weekend. The Security Council will consider its report before taking the final decision on whether to approve the sending of UN troops. Pakistan, Indonesia and Canada have already placed soldiers on stand-by for the operation. Mr Sahnoun is apparently now trying to twist the arm of General Mohamed Farrar Aideed, the warlord who controls Mogadishu south and who has threatened that he will shell UN troops who enter the country without his approval. The ambassador is telling the general that it would be much better for him to agree to a limited UN military intervention than face an intervention going ahead without his approval. The decision to send troops in a limited operation is likely to heal rifts among UN officials over what to do about Somalia. Officials in the secretary general's office have been pushing hard for full-scale military intervention in Somalia. Mr Sahnoun has been cautioning New York that such an action could be counter-productive for relief efforts if troops faced possible violent opposition to their presence in the country. It is now, however, recognised by all sides that military intervention is the only possible way to ensure food aid reaches the needy instead of ending up in the hands of bandits or merchants who are diverting relief supplies on to the market. But internal division in the UN is continuing to hold back the relief effort. Mr Sahnoun, who has achieved tremendous progress in gearing up the UN relief effort since he was appointed by the secretary general in April, is handicapped by lack of staff and resources from New York. His repeated requests for additional assistance have not been met. Observers say he is still working without the necessary support and is dependent on the other UN agencies for transport and assistance. By comparison, Mr Cyrus Vance, the recently appointed special envoy to South Africa, has a full staff.</p>

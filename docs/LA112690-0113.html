			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SEATTLE COMMUTERS HIT BY BRIDGE SINKING  </P> <P> Commuter traffic backed up for miles on icy roads today after a weekend deluge  sank a floating bridge across Lake Washington, which separates Seattle's  eastern suburbs from downtown.  </P> <P> Still, it could have been worse, the Washington State Patrol said.  </P> <P> Most commuters were aware the Interstate 90 bridge was closed and got an early  start, patrol communications supervisor Vickie Crawford said.  </P> <P> "It's really not as bad as we thought it would be," she said. But, she added,  "It was pretty much gridlocked earlier this morning."  </P> <P> About 2,100 feet of the 2-mile-long Mercer Island floating bridge sank into the  lake Sunday after a weekend of high winds and record rains. The bridge, next to  the year-old I-90 floating bridge, was being renovated for eventual use as  I-90's eastbound lanes.  </P> <P> Officials said the new bridge will probably be closed for weeks. As the main  link between Seattle and its suburbs east of the lake, the bridge normally  handles 110,000 cars a day.  </P> <P> Freezing temperatures overnight caused icy roads, which resulted in numerous  fender-benders, Crawford said. No serious injuries were reported.  </P> <P> Metro, the regional transit agency, added extra buses to try to ease the  commute.  </P> <P> Floodwaters started to back down today after the weekend storm left thousands  of people scrambling for higher ground.  </P> <P> Twenty rivers overflowed their banks and high-water marks for five of them set  records. Rainfall set records too, with 5.82 inches in Olympia and 3.56 inches  at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport during the 24 hours ending Saturday  afternoon.  </P></p>

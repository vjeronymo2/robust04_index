			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BLACK BOROUGH PRESIDENT TO CHALLENGE KOCH IN N.Y.  </P> <P> Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins today announced plans to challenge  Mayor Edward Koch's almost certain reelection bid in a race that could make  Dinkins the city's first black mayor.  </P> <P> "I am running for the office of mayor," Dinkins told a packed news conference,  ending more than a year of speculation over whether he would challenge the  city's outspoken, three-term mayor.  </P> <P> "I am running because New Yorkers deserve leadership that can set a new tone,  offer a renewed spirit of hope and optimism, reawaken citizen participation and  restore civility to the governmental process," Dinkins said.  </P> <P> Polls show Dinkins has a good chance of defeating Koch.  </P> <P> His expected candidacy had already persuaded at least three potential  contenders to shy away from the race for fear too many entrants will split an  organized opposition to the politically embattled mayor.  </P> <P> A Daily News poll in January showed that Dinkins would capture 51% of the vote  against Koch's 37% if the two were the only candidates.  </P> <P> Koch has indicated that he will seek election to an unprecedented fourth term,  while conceding that the bid will be his toughest fight yet.  </P> <P> Koch's combative style appears to have soured many voters. The candidate who  once said, "I'll get a better job, but you won't get a better mayor," found  himself stumbling in his relations with many important voting blocks, including  blacks.  </P></p>

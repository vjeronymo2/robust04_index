Amalia Pando prepared the following  report:    [Begin recording]    Pando: Coca producers staged a massive ambush of  80 Umopar [Mobile Police Unit for Rural Areas] and Direco [Coca  Reduction Directorate] agents and (chaqueadores) in Entre Rios  between 0300 and 0600 on 5 March. As a result, one person was  killed, 18 wounded, five individuals were taken hostage, and two  jeeps and three pickup trucks were dynamited and set on fire.    This is how Interior Minister German Quiroga reported what  happened in Chapare:    Quiroga: We discovered two maceration pits in this  area [pointing at map]. Our instructions in these cases is to  destroy 1,300 square meters of coca plantations, that is, 10  percent of an hectare, more or less. Nearly 1,000 peasants stood  by while we destroyed that coca. They accepted the destruction  of the crops around the two pits, which they could clearly see.    When Direco and Umopar forces started back to their vehicles  parked on the road, they encountered a first group of peasants  -- about 1,000 of them -- who were told that the people who were  leaving were those who destroyed the maceration pits and the  coca crops around them. The peasants opened the way and let them  pass.    But after walking another 250 meters they encountered a  second group of peasants -- also about 1,000 strong -- who  blocked their way out. When the officials tried to withdraw they  realized that the first group was behind them. Therefore, what  happened here was an ambush. Between 2,000 and 2,500 peasants  ambushed Umopar agents, Direco forces, and the coca cutters  [macheteros] who came with them. They were all ambushed by the  2,000 peasants.    Among them, nearly 500 were (chacas) and (boleros). (Chacas)  are people who trade coca leaf while (boleros) collect cocaine  paste. Nearly 25 percent of these 2,000 individuals were not  peasants; they were not from the area. This was noticeable  because of the way they dressed. They wore shorts, dark glasses,  striped garments, etc.    The peasant leader then gave the order to attack.    Unidentified reporter: How large was the  government force that was attacked?    Quiroga: Approximately 80 individuals, including  soldiers and those waiting in the vehicles.    As a result of the confrontation that followed the attack  ordered by the peasant leaders, eight Umopar agents were  wounded, including an officer who is in serious condition and is  being treated at (Huayanini) Hospital in Santa Cruz. Ten Direco  officers also were wounded. One of the prosecutors who followed  the operation -- all operations are controlled by prosecutors  under the Special Antinarcotics Force's charter -- also was  wounded. He was speared in the abdomen and taken by helicopter  to Cochabamba. In all, 18 people were injured during the  confrontation and one individual died. He was a Direco employee.  The peasants took three hostages. They are still being kept  hostage at this minute. Two other Direco officials disappeared  and their whereabouts are unknown.    Pando: Minister Quiroga said no one was injured  among the peasants because Umopar forces did not use their  weapons. The exception was a peasant who lost a hand trying to  place a dynamite stick under a truck. Quiroga said the five  vehicles waiting to pick up the coca cutters were dynamited, and  that on the afternoon of 5 March another crowd set Direco  offices in Ivirgazama on fire. Quiroga added that Umopar was  able to disconnect a bomb made up of three small barrels filled  with explosives.    Regarding the identification of the machete holder who died  in the ambush, Quiroga said his name is not known because the  body remains in the hands of the peasants, adding that one of  the hostages who managed to escape saw him. Quiroga said no one  has been arrested so far, adding, however, that those  responsible for the 5 March ambush and attacks will be arrested  and placed at the disposal of the courts.    Quiroga insisted that the government is ready to talk with  Chapare leaders and is waiting for the confirmation of a meeting  arranged with them in principle for 9 March [end recording].</p>

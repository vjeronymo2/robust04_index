			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: *** 1/2 JOHNNY GILL "JOHNNY GILL" MOTOWN: ALBUMS ARE RATED FROM  ONE TO FIVE STARS.  </P> <P> For the fading art of R&amp;B ballad singing, this album by one of the stars of  New Edition is a badly needed boost. Kids today consider R&amp;B ballads old  folks' music because the leading practitioners are in their late 20s and older,  singing to a largely thirtysomething audience.  </P> <P> The genre needs a dose of youth from good-looking, hip and prominent artists  like Gill who are idolized by female teens. What makes Gill's album especially  valuable is that it's one of the best R&amp;B ballad albums of the last few  years.  </P> <P> Unlike most of the current crop of young, black, male artists, Gill can really  sing. The impact of cuts like "My, My, My" and "Let's Spend the Night" show  that he clearly understands that a good R&amp;B ballad has the intensity of a  smoldering ember and is an exercise in sensuality and romanticism.  </P> <P> Like most first-rate ballad singers, Gill is just an ordinary up-tempo singer,  and he doesn't do justice to the few quality hip-hop tunes here. Two elite  teams -- Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, and L.A. Reid and Babyface -- are  responsible for the exceptional songs and production. DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

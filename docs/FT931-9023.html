			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: YSL warns of sharp profits fall YVES SAINT-LAURENT, the French fashion house embroiled in a political row over its recent FFr3.6bn (Dollars 640m) takeover by Elf-Sanofi, the pharmaceuticals group, yesterday warned of a sharp fall in net profits for 1992. The group, which is run by Mr Pierre Berge, estimated that its operating profits fell by about 25 per cent in 1992 - to around FFr384m from FFr512m in 1991 - with net profits falling 'at a faster rate'. YSL saw sales fall by 2 per cent to FFr3bn during the year from FFr3.06bn in 1991. The couture division was worst affected with sales falling by 5.5 per cent to FFr527m. Under the terms of the Elf deal, a complex share swap arrangement, the pharmaceuticals group will take control of YSL's perfume and cosmetic interests, but Mr Berge will continue to run the fashion business with Mr Saint-Laurent. Bull, the French computer group, saw sales fall 9.7 per cent from FFr33.45bn (Dollars 5.95bn) in 1991 to FFr30.18bn last year. However the group did manage to improve its operating margins during the year.</p>

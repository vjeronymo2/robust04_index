			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ana Maria Tahan and Lucia Helena Gazzola] </F>   [Text] The PT [Workers Party] is preparing an alternative  project for the third stage of the government economic  stabilization plan. The proposal condemns parity exchange  between the dollar and the real, (that is, $1 for 1 real). PT  presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva told O ESTADO:  "We do not agree with the dollarization of the economy."  Instead of backing the new currency with dollar reserves, the  PT will propose creating a national currency back up fund based  on the patrimony of Brazilian economy.    The alternative PT project has been under study for the past  three months. It will be made public before the end of the  month, that is, 30 days before the real comes into circulation.  It clearly has a political and electoral purpose: to state  Lula's position regarding the government economic program which  is the basis of Fernando Henrique Cardoso's candidacy.    "If we have 40 percent of the voters' preference and if we  are ahead in all polls, we must say what we think of the  economic plan that, for better or worse, we will probably  inherit," Lula told O ESTADO. PT government platform  coordinator Marco Aurelio Garcia said: "A frozen exchange rate  could have serious consequences and may harm the start of the PT  administration if we win the elections," adding: "This is why it  is important to establish our position regarding the third stage  of the government economic plan."    Economist Paulo Nogueira Batista Jr. suggested a plan, which  is being analyzed by a group of PT experts, to establish a  special mortgage in the Central Bank on private and public,  foreign and national companies with a net patrimony above a  certain level. The mortgage would be used to back up the new  currency. The companies "would be urged" to establish such  mortgage.    The PT is also discussing the possibility of using workers'  assets, like the Severance Pay Fund [FGTS], to back up the new  currency. As a counterpart, companies and workers could be  represented in the Currency Stabilization Council and  participate in the results of issuing the real [as published].  In both cases, Paulo Nogueira Batista Jr.'s proposal foresees  issuing a security that would be the only one to pay monetary  correction and a reasonable interest rate. The new currency  then, could be converted to this security.    The mortgage on the companies' patrimony would have a  expiration date which will be defined by the PT. "When the  stabilization process concludes, the companies would not suffer  losses and their patrimony will have not lost its value," said  PT Senator Eduardo Suplicy, one of the economists studying the  alternative PT economic project. "In this manner, companies  would be very interested in the success of the stabilization  project," he added.    Beside this, on the grounds that Lula is currently the  favorite to win the elections, he intends to negotiate with  President Itamar Franco on access to the administrative  apparatus during the election campaign. The PT wants access to  the figures and data used inside the government to obtain a  clearer and more objective notion of what awaits it in case it  wins the elections. "We will ask for access to all the  available information in order to prepare our government  programs," one of the main national PT leaders told O ESTADO.    The PT proposal, which is being prepared by a group  comprising Paulo Nogueira Batista Jr., Paul Singer, Deputy  Aloizio Mercadante, and Suplicy, still generates conflicting  opinions. Some really want to present the document as an  alternative government project, while others want to simply  express the opinions of the PT, without it being a formal  counterproposal. It has been decided, however, that the  document will condemn backing the new currency with the dollar  reserves. "We do not want to receive the government with a  dollarized economy," said PT national President Rui Falcao. PT  economists are scared of the possibility that the dollarization  of the economy may kill Brazilian industry as it did in  Argentina.    The party has not decided yet how to present its proposal:  Through its congressional bloc, or by Lula himself to mark the  party's political stance. Either way, the document will be  announced amid great publicity to gain points in a month of poor  election campaign performance and when the public's attention is  concentrated on the upcoming world cup soccer.</p>

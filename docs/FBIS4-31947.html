			<p>BFN     [Text] Skoplje, June 16 (TANJUG) -- Some 250,000 members of  the Association of Serbs and Montenegrins in the Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia (F.Y.R.M.) will not boycott the upcoming  census, but have doubts as to its regularity. Association  President Nebojsa Tomovic assessed that the census was designed  to provide a basis for dividing the F.R.Y.M. between the  Macedonians and ethnic Albanians. It was also to enable  federalization of this republic after the American-designed  model used in the case of the Bosnian Moslem-Croatian Federation.    The F.Y.R.M. has a population of about two million,  according  to the latest census in 1991. Ethnic Albanians accounted for 21  percent, although they claim their number was higher. "All this  is being prepared behind the back of the Macedonian people, and  the in-the-field decisions are being taken by American  politicians according to intructions from Washington. The Serbs  in Macedonia fully share the fate of the Macedonian people and  oppose such U.S. plans on federalization of Macedonia," he said.    The census, Tomovic added, was designed to reduce the number  of Serbs in the F.Y.R.M. to an insignificant figure and thus  eliminate their influence on the final outcome of such plans.  Tomovic described as a provocation by the Macedonian  authorities the fact that many Serb nationals -- originally from  Serbia's southern province of Kosovo and Metohija -- when  obtaining F.Y.R.M. citizenship papers discovered that Macedonian  police had put down they came or were born in the "State of  Kosovo".    A strong separatist movement of ethnic Albanians, demanding  a  separate state and its secession from Serbia, was active for the  past two decades in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo and  Metohija. The Serbs and Montenegrins were increasingly  frequently questioning the validity of the upcoming census, and  even their participation in it because of the rigorous  conditions set by citizenship legislation. Among other things,  it requires 15 years of permanent residence in the F.Y.R.M. to  obtain Macedonian citizenship.    It is believed that several thousand Serbs and Montenegrins  would not meet the conditions required for obtaining  citizenship. In this way, the participation of the Serb  community in the overall population of the F.R.Y.M. would drop.  The F.R.Y.M. authorities, say Serbs accounted for about 2.2  percent of the population, while the Serbs there claim they  number about 250,000, or above 10 percent.</p>

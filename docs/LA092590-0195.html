			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JOB MARKET;  </P> <P> SURVIVING IN THE '90S;  </P> <P> STATE LENDS A HAND TO WHITE-COLLAR WORKERS;  </P> <P> A NEW $18.5-MILLION COMPUTERIZED SYSTEM AND SELF-HELP JOB CLUBS HELPS  PROFESSIONALS GET BACK IN THE WORK FORCE.  </P> <P> Margaret Joyce of Thousand Oaks was still adjusting to the shock of being laid  off from her well-paying managerial job with an electronics firm when she got  another, albeit more pleasant, surprise: The state Employment Development  Department has a no-cost, comprehensive program just for high-ranking  white-collar workers.  </P> <P> "It was a real learning experience for me to find out they don't work just with  blue-collar jobs, they are really interested in getting the professionals back  to work too," Joyce said. She was talking about the state agency that has best  been known for running the network of "unemployment offices" where displaced  workers -- many unskilled or semi-skilled -- go to collect benefit checks and  to seek new jobs.  </P> <P> Increasingly, the state agency has been working to expand its scope to reflect  California's shifting job market. Its primary tool has been its 23 Experience  Unlimited "job clubs" for unemployed managerial, technical and professional  workers. Last fall, it launched its first "industry-specific" project -- the  Aerospace Human Resources Network Office in Manhattan Beach -- and plans in the  coming months to start another in the San Francisco Bay Area for the  electronics industry.  </P> <P> "It has taken us years to dispel the myth that this is just a place for the  unskilled and the destitute," said department spokeswoman Valerie J. Reynoso.  "We have excellent services for the increasing numbers of professionals who  suddenly find themselves out of a job for the first time since college."  </P> <P> Last year, the department placed about 500,000 workers in new jobs, about 10%  of which were in professional, technical or managerial categories, Reynoso  said. Its placement services -- provided at no charge to job-seekers and to  California's approximately 850,000 employers -- represent one of the  better-known aspects of the state's third-largest department. With an annual  operating budget of $587 million -- almost $409 million of which comes from the  federal government -- the EDD has more than 400 offices throughout the state.  It collects various job-related taxes ($13 billion in 1987), distributes  unemployment and disability insurance payments ($1.9 billion and $1.35 billion,  respectively, in 1987, the most recent year for which statistics are  available). The EDD also provides special job training programs for youths and  other groups, maintains wage records and is a major source of labor-market  information.  </P> <P> But with the slowing of California's economy, the loss of many electronics and  defense-related jobs and the downsizing that has accompanied a decade packed  with mergers and acquisitions, the department has put increased emphasis on  employment services, especially for white-collar workers, Reynoso said.  </P> <P> "We're changing because those folks with needs out there are changing. We're  seeing different faces these days -- not just blue-collar folks but those whose  experience includes administration or engineering, those with advanced academic  degrees," she said.  </P> <P> For all classes of job-seekers, the task of finding employment is getting a  boost from the department's new $18.5-million Job Match, a massive,  computerized program that connects eligible applicants with jobs anywhere in  the state.  </P> <P> Begun in Northern California in the fall of 1988, Job Match is gradually being  added at EDD job services offices throughout the state, and officials expect it  to be fully operational by next spring. Employers can find qualified applicants  from anywhere in the state, while job seekers no longer will have to go down to  the local unemployment office periodically to check job postings. At offices  that already have the Job Match system, EDD employees call a job-seeker at home  whenever the computer spits out an appropriate listing.  </P> <P> For displaced professionals, however, the informal self-help job clubs known as  Experience Unlimited remain the department's most effective tool.  </P> <P> The job clubs, which grew out of a 1959 experiment in Berkeley and flourished  for more than a decade before fading in the late 1970s, were revived in 1986 by  then-EDD Director Kaye R. Kiddoo, a former Lockheed executive who believed that  they could serve a growing need.  </P> <P> The state provides one employee to coordinate job club services at each  participating EDD office and allows members use of office computers,  telephones, facsimile machines and other facilities. Members help each other in  scores of ways, including updating resumes, providing job leads, brushing up on  interview techniques and helping at job fairs. Club members also put out a  newsletter that contains resume summaries, coded for privacy, and sent to  employers throughout California and other parts of the nation.  </P> <P> Once employed, many former club members help with everything from job leads to  employment counseling. All services are free, but members are expected to spend  at least four hours a week on club activities.  </P> <P> "The length of unemployment varies with the positions and the salaries they  earned, but in the two years we've been here, all of our members have gone back  to work," said Norma Reagin, director of the job club in Santa Ana, one of two  in Orange County.  </P> <P> Reagin estimated that the club -- which lately has had from 150 to 180 members  at any given time -- has helped about 2,000 professionals get back to work,  including engineers, human resources managers, computer analysts and even some  chief executives, with salaries averaging around $50,000, although some members  were earning $100,000 or more when they lost their jobs.  </P> <P> Patricia Baldoni, who oversees the job club in Simi Valley, said many members  are high-achieving, well-educated people who have suddenly found themselves  looking for work for the first time since college. Often, they need help  learning to market themselves. The club's strength, she said, lies in "the  diversity of the talents of its members and their willingness to help each  other."  </P> <P> For Joyce, 34, who lost her job as director of corporate purchasing at a Bay  Area-based electronics firm about a year after it closed its Chatsworth plant,  membership in the Simi Valley job club provides an opportunity to meet with  others in similar circumstances.  </P> <P> "It gives you a chance to talk with peers, to realize there are a lot of really  talented people that this has happened to. Without that, you can start to feel  bad about yourself. This helps you keep your spirits up," Joyce said.  </P> <P> M. Ross Feeney, 53, of Inglewood, who lost his job running a materials lab in  Torrance when his firm cut back its work force, said job clubs such as the one  at the EDD's Manhattan Beach aerospace network office help bolster his resolve  to push hard for new employment.  </P> <P> "When you're looking by yourself, you get so you hate the rejections, so you  stop looking as hard as you should," Feeney said.  </P> <P> During one recent afternoon in the network office's suite near many of the  South Bay's aerospace firms, Feeney and two other laid-off aerospace employees,  guided by club coordinator Cheryl Dotson, studied videotapes of Feeney's mock  job interview, looking for ways to sharpen his technique.  </P> <P> Earlier, this small group of new club members -- which included financial  analyst Melvain L. Sturdivant, 42, of Carson and engineer Gerald L. Morris, 46,  of Manhattan Beach -- had attended a weeklong orientation session and updated  resumes.  </P> <P> The network is run jointly by the EDD and seven of Southern California's major  aerospace employers. Dotson said about 1,000 displaced workers have registered  with the office since it opened in October, and about half have found new jobs.  </P> <P> Assistant manager Marie Quinn said a increasingly important thrust for the  aerospace office is "to open other avenues, to help these people look at  getting into other fields." That is not an easy concept for career aerospace  workers to accept, she acknowledged.  </P> <P> "I'm not yet ready to make a change," said Morris, who spent 15 years solving  design problems for the same firm. "But I know (the aerospace downsizing) is  going to be permanent, so now is a good time for me to start thinking about  where I should be going and what I want to do next."  </P> <P> In every office there are some happy endings, the kind of success stories that  keep the others going. For Robert Stackhouse, 55, of Simi Valley, it came 11  months after a corporate takeover cost him his $63,000-a-year position as  director of contracts for a defense firm. Earlier this month, after a "bleak  and discouraging" search, he started work for an international consulting firm  -- a position he found through a tip from a former job club member.  </P> <P> "I'm glad it's over," Stackhouse said of his experience with unemployment. "But  I will continue to do whatever I can to support the job club here."  </P> <P> </P> <P> RESOURCE: EDD OFFICES WITH JOB CLUBS  </P> <P> * Los Angeles County  </P> <P> Aerospace Human Resources Network Office, 3601 Aviation Blvd., Suite 3000,  Manhattan Beach (213) 536-9355.  </P> <P> 1116 N.

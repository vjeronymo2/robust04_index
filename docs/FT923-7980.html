			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Water costs AS WITH motherhood and apple pie, it is hard to be against higher water quality standards. Not so the cost of such improvements, which is potentially enormous. Yesterday's report from Mr Ian Byatt, the UK water regulator, estimates that water bills could rise as much as 50 per cent in real terms by the end of the century - and double by the year 2005. With water bills already accounting for more than 1 per cent of average net household income, Mr Byatt is right to express concern about the ability or willingness of customers to afford such rises. Certainly there are improvements which need to be made in the quality of water supplies and the removal of sewerage. Avoiding outbreaks of bacterial contamination of drinking water requires further investment. And improvements in sewerage disposal are needed if bathing beaches are not to suffer avoidable pollution. However, there are grounds for questioning whether some targets imposed by the EC and other environmental watchdogs are not excessive. The EC target for nitrate residues, for example, is set at a level which is the subject of considerable scientific controversy. Water companies may be required to take expensive steps to remove impurities from moorland water which do little more than give it a brownish tinge. Further investment is to be required to remove pesticide residues from water which is already 20,000 times less contaminated than vegetables cooked in it. Existing EC directives must, of course, be enforced (although even then there is scope for interpretation of the requirements, as Mr Byatt pointed out). But any new regulations should be subject to much closer scrutiny before they are agreed. The case for higher standards needs to be established by adequate scientific re-search and analysis. And the benefits of such improvements should be weighed against their cost. Even when the case for higher water standards is made, the cost should not always fall on the consumer. If nitrate and pesticide residues have to be removed expensively from water supplies, the principle that the polluter pays suggests a tax on the originator of the contamination to cover the cost. There is also scope for savings to offset cost increases. Installing meters offers a cheaper way of balancing supply and demand in areas of shortage than increasing capacity. Mr Byatt indicates that he sees opportunities for greater efficiency improvements when the price limits formula is revised in 1995. And further cost reductions could be achieved if the return on capital in the water industry fell to reflect the very low risk in this essential utility. Even if all these savings are made, there will still be real rises in water bills over the next 10 years. But if the increases are at the bottom of the range suggested in Mr Byatt's paper, it will be due to his assiduity in pointing out the cost of environmental rules. Consumers should welcome his initiative in opening the debate.</p>

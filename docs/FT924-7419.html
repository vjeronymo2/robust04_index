			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / World Trade News: National parties must stick by their rural roots THE existence of powerful farm lobbies in France does not fully explain why the government is so sensitive to farmers' demands. All mainstream political parties have rural roots, or are in touch with a provincial audience, since any politician with national ambitions needs to nurture a local powerbase to maintain prestige. The make-up of the population explains why. Just over 6 per cent of the French civil workforce are farmers, nearly three times that in the UK and double that in the US, Insee, the state statistics agency, says. About a fifth of the population makes a living, direct and indirect, from farming. Thus, national politicians, both right and left, tend to hold local jobs as mayors or regional councillors on top of their national mandates. Examples include Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, also known as mayor of Nevers, or Jean-Pierre Soisson, agriculture minister, who continues to be mayor of Auxerre. Among the formal lobbies, the group that counts is the Federation Nationale des Syndicats d'Exploitants Agricoles (FNSEA), which counts 600,000 members among France's nearly 1m farmers. Officially, the FNSEA is apolitical, but tends to reflect conservative views, if only because of the right's traditional strength in the French provinces, where conservative parties control 75 out of 96 departments. One of the FNSEA's former presidents is Mr Francois Guillaume, agriculture minister in the 1986-88 Gaullist government. The FNSEA, also dominated by cereal farmers, grudgingly accepts Common Agriculture Policy reforms and so has concentrated on negotiating compensation terms. But it cannot accept production cuts beyond the EC reforms, which explains the FNSEA's tough stance on Gatt and the oilseeds row. However different their interests, France farm lobbies are driven by the same fear of the gradual death of the countryside. And the social problem of a declining farm workforce remains.</p>

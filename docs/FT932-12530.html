			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Workstart scheme to start by June THE FIRST new employees to be recruited under the government's Pounds 2.6m Workstart programme should start work by June, Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, told MPs yesterday. Monitoring would be close and contracts would stipulate that individuals hired under Workstart must be additional to existing workers, she said. The scheme will give employers a government subsidy of Pounds 60 a week for taking on the long-term jobless.</p>

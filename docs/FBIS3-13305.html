King Husayn's gesture is not new; it  stems from the continuous role the Hashemites have played in  unifying the Arabs and Muslims throughout the ages. It also  indicates that this blessed month is the month of communication,  amity, and love among the Muslims in all their countries. In  addition to performing the minor pilgrimage, the king's visit to  Mecca and Medina sought to intensify Islamic and Arab efforts,  which stem from the Hashemites' struggle in national, pan-Arab,  and humanitarian Jordan, to unite in rank, word, and position.  Jordan rose above the pan-Arab wounds to heal the rift which  afflicted the Arab homeland after the Gulf war for the sake of  restoring Arab solidarity and reactivating joint Arab action  that can confront the serious challenges threatening the Arab  and Islamic nation.</p>

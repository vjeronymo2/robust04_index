			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> GRIFFEY JR. A NATURAL AT BEING BASEBALL'S NEW STAR ATTRACTION  </P> <P> It is not true that the skies parted and Ken Griffey Jr. floated down on a  cloud, nor that a voice of a prophet came out of an Iowa cornfield and told of  the coming of the perfect ballplayer, one who would dominate the national  pastime during the last decade of the 20th Century.  </P> <P> But such cosmic entrances might have been appropriate given the real-life  achievements of Junior Griffey, 20, a center fielder with the Seattle Mariners,  who began his second season as American League Player of the Month for April.  </P> <P> Not even halfway into May, Junior, still the youngest player in the big  leagues, is hitting .357 with five home runs and 20 runs batted in. Out of  respect normally reserved for veteran sluggers, he has been intentionally  walked twice this season with runners on first and third.  </P> <P> Already, he is the cornerstone of the franchise and darling of Seattle.  Twenty-thousand pens were given out on "Ken Griffey Pen Night," and they  already are worth $20 each to collectors. Few would argue that he is baseball's  most salable commodity of the '90s.  </P> <P> Junior is built like Darryl Strawberry, plays like Willie Mays, hustles like  Pete Rose and is as dedicated to excelling as Carl Yastrzemski and his  blistered and bleeding hands. Even now this Junior achiever is being measured  for the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. Many suggest that he only has to put  in 20 years and his inevitable statistics will make his election automatic.  </P> <P> "Junior's the best prospect I've ever seen," Seattle Manager Jim Lefebvre said.  "I've told our coaches, 'We're going to be able to go through our lives and say  we were there at the start of Ken Griffey Jr.'s career, a once-in-a-lifetime  kid to come along.' He is so far ahead of his talent, it's frightening. He's  got God-given instincts."  </P> <P> Mariner batting Coach Gene Clines said, "There isn't a pitch he can't hit. I've  never seen him in a slump. He adjusts like a 10-year veteran. Without a doubt  he's a God-given natural. The scary part is what he'll be accomplishing when  he's 25 years old."  </P> <P> It begins in the genes. His father, Ken Griffey, is winding down a fine career  (.297 lifetime hitter) with the Cincinnati Reds, making the Griffeys the first  father-son act performing in the majors at the same time in baseball history.  </P> <P> Ken, who now refers to himself as "The Original Griffey," said, "Kenny is  impressive in all the five important categories in the game (hitting for  average, hitting with power, running, throwing, fielding). It just doesn't make  sense for someone to have that much talent. Watching him play is almost  frightening."  </P> <P> There is a sixth category everyone is watching: Junior's ability to handle his  onrushing celebrity that is growing into a monster with every breath. It began  in the Class-A California League when the club held an unprecedented poster  night for him and sold out the ballpark. When he would go to the plate, the  public address announcer would ask, "What time is it?" The crowd would respond,  "Griffey Time."  </P> <P> In this first major league at-bat, he doubled. In his first at-bat in the  Kingdome, he homered. In his first pinch-hitting appearance, he homered. By the  end of his 1989 rookie season he had his own candy bar with his image on the  wrapper (which is ironic because his only known flaw is being allergic to  chocolate).  </P> <P> Fans also could have their choice of five Griffey posters and two Griffey  T-shirts. He more than doubled his $68,000 salary with royalties from his  off-the-field ventures. He is on the cover of Sports Illustrated and has a book  due out soon.  </P> <P> His love for the game is all-consuming. He usually is at the ballpark as many  as five hours before game time. He skitters about mischievously, teasing and  trading insults with his older teammates and is a card-game kibitzer. He wears  a fixed wide smile and Christmas morning excited eyes and swings a can't-wait  bat at imaginary pitches. With his cap on backward, his pant legs reaching his  ankles and his giddy air, he reminds one of some hotshot dude at the drive-in  after a softball game.  </P> <P> He was a leading Rookie of the Year candidate last season, batting .287 with 13  homers and 45 RBIs, when he broke his hand in a fall in a Chicago hotel room in  August. He missed four weeks. "When he returned he tried to make up the lost  time and began swinging for the fences," Lefebvre said. Griffey finished with a  .264 average, 16 homers and 61 RBIs.  </P> <P> He has a youngster's fascination for automobiles. He is driving his third BMW.  The current one has $8,000 of stereo equipment that includes 14 speakers. And,  of course, a cellular phone.  </P> <P> Junior phones his dad, his mother, Bertie, and his brother, Craig, every day. A  $600 monthly phone bill is routine. Craig is enrolled at Ohio State, where he  is a defensive back. The family is very close. Ken visited Kenny three times  when their schedules permitted last season. Last month, when both the Reds and  Mariners were playing in New York, Ken saw Kenny rob Jesse Barfield of a home  run with a spectacular catch. "I was stunned like everyone else in the stands,"  Ken said.  </P> <P> Ken did not push his son into baseball. "He plays the game with such ease and  has so much fun with it," Ken said. He believes that Kenny's lack of awe of the  big leagues has helped his development. He grew up in the Reds' locker room in  the 1970s when the Big Red Machine was winning two world championships. The  sons of those players included Pete Rose Jr., Eduardo and Victor Perez, Lee May  Jr. and Brian McRae. They were called the "Little Red Machine." By the time  Kenny was 11, Ken could no longer strike him out.  </P> <P> In interviews, his voice barely audible, Junior said, "Only thing dad ever told  me was to go out and have fun. Whatever happens, happens. Stay out of trouble  and be a good kid. . . . Playing in the big leagues while my father is still  active is the biggest thrill of my life. I try to see him play whenever I can."  </P> <P> Junior holds no awe of big league pitching. "I've been swinging the same way  since I was born. It's always worked. Why change now?"  </P></p>

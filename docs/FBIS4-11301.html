			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Aissa G. Garcia] </F>   [Text] Havana, 21 Apr (PL) -- Most of the emigrants invited  to the Nation and the Emigrants Conference that begins here  tomorrow agree on the need not only to normalize ties with their  country of origin, but also to systematize them.    For journalist Nicolas Rios, director of the Miami-based  CONTRAPUNTO magazine, this meeting attended exclusively by  Cubans "must contribute to helping us overcome the artificial  separation originated years ago between those who left and those  who stayed."    According to Rios, at this moment there are conditions for a  "reunion" because, among other things, there is the intention on  both sides to institutionalize this relationship and make it  last.    The historical confrontation between Cuba and the United  States has always affected Cuba's relations with its emigrants,  but we must overcome this factor, because by doing so, in the  long run, we ourselves will influence those ties, Rios added in  an interview with PRENSA LATINA.    Amalio Fiallo, president of the Venezuela-based Center for  the Promotion of Man, commented the single fact of being able to  talk and to talk without intermediaries represents a step  forward. He added, however, that within a timeframe of just  three days (the duration of the conference), it will be  difficult to discuss everything as we should.    According to Fiallo, the meeting is also possible because  the  Cuban community abroad has changed. He added that today "we are  not all alike, nor do we think the same, although there is a  minority who controls the media and continues to work for the  government in Washington."    Fiallo contended that the meeting is only the beginning of a  process to normalize ties, and it must not be left incomplete  because "as part of a single people" we must think about what  all Cubans are doing today to strengthen the nation.    Fiallo, who said he is attending the meeting on his own  behalf and not representing any group, stressed that any topic  is open to discussion because, despite differences of opinions,  there is on both sides an atmosphere of respect and a lack of  hostility.    Fiallo, who has recently come to Cuba to explain his plan  for  participative democracy, stated the government knows what he  thinks and has never asked or suggested that he "burn what you  have written, renounce your past, or kneel down at the Plaza de  la Revolucion and proclaim that you were wrong."    Meanwhile, Francisco Aruca, director of Miami-based Progreso  Alternativa radio station, also told PRENSA LATINA that the  conference is the first step toward preparing a coherent policy  with regard to Cubans living abroad, and particularly those  living in the United States. Aruca said an important achievement  of this meeting could be the creation of a department  responsible for dealing with the affairs of the community.    According to Aruca, Cuban residents in other countries have  a  wide variety of aspirations, including the possibility of  investing on equal footing as foreigners. Nevertheless, such  goals, as well as others, cannot be achieved because of  restrictions of the North American blockade.    Juan Manuel Rodriguez, a participant in the 1978 dialogue  and  a former member of the Revolutionary Army, said he will attend  the meeting to address the needs of emigrants in the areas of  economics and culture, but not to discuss Cuba's domestic  problems because "these must be resolved by those who are here."    More than 200 Cubans personally invited by the government of  the island will participate in the Nation and the Emigrants  Conference that begins tomorrow and runs until Sunday.    The participants have expressed their differences with the  social system that exists in the Caribbean nation, but at the  same time they agree in their opposition to the blockade that  has been imposed for more than 30 years against Cuba.</p>

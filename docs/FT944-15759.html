			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Observer: Rank outsiders The rich are not like you and me - especially when they live in Switzerland. Nearly half of the country's 50 richest residents are not Swiss nationals, according to the latest rankings in Swiss business magazine Bilanz. Among the 25 Swiss franc multi-billionaires, all but seven are foreign, including Otto Beisheim of the German Metro retail group, Octav Botnar, the fugitive British car dealer, and Johann Rupert, of the Rothmans tobacco and Vendome luxury goods businesses. Notably absent from this year's list, however, are the Brenninkmeijers behind the C&amp;A clothing store chain. The reclusive family complained last year that, while its wealth might be considerable, and many members of the clan might live in Switzerland, no single family member possessed a particularly large chunk of the fortune. Bilanz still believes that the Brenninkmeijers are wealthier than the officially designated number ones, Vera Oeri-Hoffmann and Lukas Hoffmann, inheritors of the Hoffmann-La Roche drugs group, who weigh in at some SFr10bn each.</p>

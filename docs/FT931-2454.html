			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / BBC says Birt was not first executive hired as freelance THE BBC acknowledged yesterday that Mr John Birt, the director-general, was not the first top executive to be hired on a freelance basis. The disclosure, by the board of governors, came after a meeting at which it was decided that neither Mr Birt nor Mr Marmaduke Hussey, the chairman, should resign. The governors said that in future, 'the roles and responsibilities of the board will be better defined' and that 'all board members' will 'receive full information in relation to key public interest issues and approve all decisions on matters of remuneration'. Their statement added that details of the new approach and the changes to the BBC's current system will be given in the next few weeks. The board's statement did not name the senior executives who had enjoyed the same contractual relationship as Mr Birt, and last night the BBC would not elaborate. The statement said that at present all members of the board of management were employed on a staff basis. Although the governors expressed unanimous support for Mr Birt, they said it was an error to have employed him on a contract basis. The clear implication of the governors' statement is that while Mr Birt was not director-general, they did not feel it necessary to require him to join the staff of the BBC, particularly as precedents had already been set by other senior managers and as his tax arrangements were legal. However, once he was to become director-general, the governors felt he should join the BBC's staff PAYE scheme. They added that the precedents set for Mr Birt's tax arrangements, under which his salary was paid into his private company, pre-dated the appointments of both Mr Hussey and Sir Michael Checkland, the previous director-general. The governors said Mr Hussey made clear last year, when it was known that Mr Birt would move to become director-general this year, that his contract 'should be completely renegotiated'. But last November, when Sir Michael announced that he was leaving three months early, Mr Birt suggested that the renegotiation of his own contract should be 'put on one side' because of the pressure of 'urgent and widespread further responsibilities'. Mr Birt took over as director-general on January 1. It also emerged yesterday that governors appear to have taken steps to protect the BBC from other possible repercussions concerning Mr Birt's previous freelance status, by asking for a financial indemnity from Mr Birt over his tax affairs at Tuesday's special meeting of the board. However, it was not clear yesterday whether Mr Birt has yet signed such an indemnity, which would make him and his private company, John Birt Productions, responsible for his tax affairs during the period of his freelance contract. Without such an indemnity, the BBC would be responsible for Mr Birt's tax if there were any problems with the Inland Revenue. Mr Robert McLennan, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman and a member of the BBC's general advisory council, last night said the statement simply confirmed that 'Mr Hussey has lost all moral authority and therefore the ability to speak effectively for the BBC at this time of difficulty'. 24-hour BBC news opposed in poll, Page 6</p>

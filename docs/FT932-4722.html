			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Arts: The Venetian Twins - Theatre out of London 'The Italian Moliere': so Voltaire called Carlo Goldoni. Like Moliere, Goldoni often relied on commedia dell'arte formulae for his plots. The Venetian twins of this play, Zanetto and Tonino, sundered for yonks, with contrasting manners but identical looks, happen to arrive in Verona at the same time and keep bumping into each other's acquaintances and fiancees, with predictably chaotic results. Sounds familiar? Yes, Goldoni's guys from Venice might often be Shakespeare's boys from Syracuse - if plot were all. But nobody would have compared Goldoni with Moliere if all he had done was to follow a formula. He knew how to rejuvenate a comic recipe with humanity, satire and emotional truth. Last year, when Giorgio Strehler's staging of Goldoni's Le Baruffe chiozzotte visited the National Theatre, Londoners saw a classic demonstration of how deep his comedy runs. Michael Bogdanov's new RSC staging of Ranjit Bolt's new version of the play is, as Clement Crisp would say, very other. Costumes and language veer between 18th and 20th centuries, and between Italy and England. And Bogdanov inflates chunks of it into British pantomime horseplay - to the extent of stepping out of character. All this reaches its most far-fetched early on, when an orchestrated sword-fight grows so over the top that the actors wound a member of the audience: imagine the fuss. Not only the police arrive to see what's up, but also (on press night, at any rate) David Calder, the RSC's new Shylock, from the theatre next door. What a riot] Guffaw, scream, cackle. But Goldoni (remember Goldoni, boys?) was so much the master of his medium that he could cloak the sun and turn a comedy dark with sudden death. When this happens near the end of The Venetian Twins, the RSC audience cannot help realising how much more integrity this play has than Bogdanov's staging allows. (I speak as one who had guffawed too.) The play's most virtuoso touch is that one actor plays both twins. David Troughton plays Zanetto/Tonino with conquering panache - though you cannot believe that this Zanetto is used to riches, and he (like Bolt's text) overdoes Zanetto's stupidity. As the fop Lelio, Guy Henry shows us again what a sublime comic character actor he is. With minimum effort, he manages to be, at the same time, verbose, effete, pompous, lugubrious, hilarious, and vulnerable; and he can be funny just by blinking. But we already knew this much; he is in danger of dwindling into an 'act' instead of growing as an actor. He needs directors more subtle than Bogdanov. Most of the rest are just energetic cardboard and paste. Sarah Woodward is a two-dimensional Rosaura, Jenny Quayle a one-dimensional Beatrice (neither funny nor serious), Sian Radinger a coarse Colombina, Jonathan Philips an overwrought Florindo (and will someone confiscate his eyeliner?). Even Robin Soan, recently so exemplary in Three Birds Alighting on a Field, lets the Doctor become a crusty stereotype. Some music by Terry Malcolm introduces, interrupts and sometimes accompanies the action. Conflating isolated lines from Verdi, Sullivan, and 'O sole mio', it is played with cheerful ghastliness by the town band from Inferno-atte-Po. Ho ho but not all evening ho. In repertory at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon</p>

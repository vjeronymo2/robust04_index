			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA, WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> 7 SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN 2 BANK ROBBERIES  </P> <P> Seven bank robbery suspects were arrested Monday after witnesses helped police  track getaway cars allegedly used in two unrelated bank robberies, authorities  said Tuesday.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Santa Ana Police Department said investigators recovered  $25,000 in cash and arrested four Fresno residents shortly after the robbery of  a Wells Fargo Bank in the 1700 block of South Grand Avenue Monday afternoon .  </P> <P> Five minutes later, Westminster police arrested three Oceanside residents  suspected in the robbery of $1,500 that morning from a Sanwa Bank in the 7700  block of Westminster Boulevard.  </P> <P> Martin Trevino Vargas, 42; Frances Rose Tapia, 40; Stephen Serna, 42, and  Katherine Rosiles, 27, all of Fresno, were arrested after an unidentified  couple spotted an armed man running from the Wells Fargo Bank to a green Ford  Fairmont and decided to follow the car, Santa Ana Police Lt. Rick Hicks said.  </P> <P> Apparently unaware that they were being trailed, Hicks said, the suspects  headed south through heavy traffic on Edinger Avenue.  </P> <P> Near Red Hill Avenue, the couple alerted a Tustin police officer, who radioed  for assistance before making the arrest without incident at Mitchell Avenue.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Westminster police took Henry Thomas Bottoms, 39; Lisa Marie  Apodaca, 38, and Peter Safford Green, 38, all of Oceanside, into custody in the  parking lot of a motel a few blocks from the Sanwa Bank.  </P> <P> In that case, Police Lt. Richard Main said, police were assisted by witnesses  who provided a description of the alleged getaway car, a gold Chevrolet Camaro  with Kentucky license plates.  </P> <P> One man had entered the bank, brandished a gun and demanded money from a teller  before escaping, Main said. The three are being held in federal prison at  Terminal Island, he added.  </P> <P> The suspects in the Wells Fargo robbery were being held on Tuesday in Orange  County Jail. WENDY PAULSON  </P></p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Expo businesses attack DTI over Seville service: The Department of Trade and Industry is under fire from businessmen and politicians for alleged mismanagement of the British pavilion at Expo 92, the international fair held last year in Spain The building, paid for with about Pounds 20m of public money, was hailed at the time by Mr Peter Lilley, trade secretary, as 'a showpiece of British imagination and flair, Britain at its most innovative and entertaining best'. But four months after Expo closed it lies empty while the DTI finds itself embroiled in a controversy which includes: Liquidation of a retailing company contracted by the DTI to run the pavilion shop and fly the flag with an assortment of British products supplied by dozens of leading UK companies. The company, Joanna Bickerton Associates, has debts of nearly Pounds 500,000. Freezing of a Spanish bank account opened by the DTI on behalf of JBA, containing an undisclosed amount of money. A possible lawsuit against the DTI. KPMG Peat Marwick, JBA's liquidators, are taking advice on whether there was direct legal involvement by the DTI in the JBA trading operation, which went into receivership last August, and whether a successful claim can be made against the DTI on behalf of creditors. Separate legal action being considered by at least two other creditors against the DTI. Demolition of the award-winning pavilion possibly by the end of March unless a buyer is found. The pavilion, the size of Westminster Abbey, was designed by Nicholas Grimshaw, built by Trafalgar House and won a 1992 British Construction Industry prize. The total cost of construction and appearing at Expo was Pounds 25m, about Pounds 5m from commercial sponsorship, the rest from the government, mainly the DTI. One of Joanna Bickerton Associates' creditors, HHL Publishing, which supplied magazines and books to the pavilion, is taking legal advice on how to recover Pounds 240,000 owed by the company. Mr Steve Pae, HHL finance director, said: 'We believe that a lot of the information that was provided to us by the DTI when we went in for tender was misleading. There is also a question over whether the DTI was acting as a 'shadow director' of JBA during the Expo,' effectively helping to run some aspects of the company. A second creditor, Farrow and Humphreys, a leading UK manufacturer of toiletries, is owed Pounds 7,000 for goods delivered to Expo but never paid for. Mr Ron Humphreys, Farrow and Humphreys managing director, said he is considering legal action to recover money held in an Spanish bank account opened for JBA in the DTI's name, which he has had frozen under a court order. He does not yet know how much is in the account, but the DTI has admitted that at least some of the money is from sales of goods in the Expo shop run by JBA, and represents money owed to suppliers. Mr Humphreys has written to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, strongly criticising his department's handling of the Expo. 'As one of the . . . exporting companies damaged by the affair, our cash resources and the confidence of our bankers has been badly dented, thereby reducing - not enhancing - our export drive, not to mention our enthusiasm and sense of national pride.' Mr Richard Bickerton, a JBA director said: 'I hold the DTI completely responsible for providing us with market research (on the projected number of visitors to the UK pavilion) which proved to be grossly inaccurate . . . They've not only messed us up, but also a number of very good British companies of a variety of sizes.' KPMG Peat Marwick have confirmed that Mr Bickerton owned a building company, GOH Bickerton and Sons, which went into receivership two years before the Expo fair. The DTI has told the FT that that was not a retailing company. JBA was picked as sole British concessionaire for Seville on the basis of the company's past good record in running shops similar to those at Expo, the DTI said. The DTI forecast of visitors, on which the retailing contract was based, said 2.75m people would visit the pavilion during Expo, which ran from April to October. JBA said Expo receipts show the true figure was nearer 1.5m. More than 50 organisations supplied the British pavilion through JBA and all are owed money. They include Dartington Crystal, Royal Doulton (part of Pearson, which owns the Financial Times), the BBC World Service, Marks and Spencer and Highland Spring. The BBC confirmed that it had registered a claim with JBA's liquidators. Royal Doulton and M and S had no comment. Highland Spring said: 'We are owed money . . . we are waiting to see what the DTI has to say.' The DTI said that it has made some ex gratia payments covering royalties which companies were made to pay to JBA before Expo got under way. Advance royalty payments were stipulated by the Expo authorities. The DTI said the ex gratia payments did not constitute any admission of liability and that it considers any other outstanding sums to be commercial debts for which the department cannot be held responsible. Ms Rosalind Cole, the DTI's 'project manager, Expo 92 Unit' was unavailable for comment. Sir John Ure, a former British ambassador and UK 'commissioner-general for Expo' - described by the DTI as the 'figurehead' for the fair, said when it closed: 'Our main objectives - to project Britain as an outward looking, technologically advanced, friendly nation . . . have been met.' Sir John has since retired. Mr Eric Dancer, managing director of Dartington Crystal, which has a claim of Pounds 40,000 against JBA said: 'I think British industry should think very seriously about participating in any future trade show organised by the DTI. The DTI has let the side down very badly.' The DTI is also facing criticism from a different quarter. Conserve, a Tory party pressure group set up three years ago by Sir David Trippier, then minister of the environment to promote environmental issues, has accused the DTI of going against the 'national interest' in delaying a decision on the future of the British pavilion. Conserve trustees include Lord Forte and Lord Palumbo. Another Conserve director, Prof Paul Cook, a scientific adviser to the Department of the Environment, suggested moving the pavilion to Regent's Park in London under the auspices of the British Science and Technology Trust, of which he is president. Trustees include Baroness Thatcher. In a letter sent on behalf of Conserve to the political office at 10 Downing Street and to Mr David MacLean, environment minister, Lady Olga Maitland MP said: 'Bearing in mind there is no question of financial input from the government, it would be vital for the scheme's success to have the government's unqualified blessing. This will provide the lever to raise the necessary funds.' The proposal was forwarded to the DTI which has never responded. Prof Cook said: 'The DTI has handled our proposal atrociously . . . at least they should have the decency to say one thing or the other. Taxpayers are geting nothing out of Expo.' The DTI said some proposals had been turned down on financial or construction grounds. Advised by property agents Healey &amp; Baker, the DTI is in 'final negotiations' with an interested company. It is understood that the DTI has been in discussions with a businessman, Mr Sharad Patel, who wants to move the pavilion to the UK as headquarters of a new media satellite station. The DTI has been offered less than Pounds 1m for the pavilion which would take at least six months to be removed. Under rules agreed by all participating countries, the five-storey British building may be knocked down if the DTI fails to dispose of it by the end of March. Alternatively the DTI will have to start paying rent to the Spanish authorities. Ms Ines Alba from Cartuja 93, the government agency running the former Expo site, said: 'We calculate that the delay is going to cost the British government another Pounds 65,000.' The DTI rejected charges of mismanagement and defended its Expo record: 'It was an opportunity to show the rest of the world what Britain could do, the Best of Britain.'

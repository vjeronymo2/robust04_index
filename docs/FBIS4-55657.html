			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "...And They Set Up a New Party"] </F>   [Excerpts] Bratislava--"Forces that do not wish for a  strong green party on the Slovak political scene have become  active again," states a statement issued by the Green Party in  Slovakia (SZS), which SZS Deputy Chairman Pavol Fabian made  available to the TA SR yesterday. Three party members decided  to leave the SZS before the coming elections and have launched a  petition campaign, the aim of which is to register the  "genuinely Slovak Green Party." One of the founders of the new  party is a former SZS member, who was recently caught as she  unlawfully manipulated the registration cards of SZS members.  [passage omitted] Only 17 days after this incident, she set up  the new party. According to the SZS Presidium, the three  signatories of the appeal for the establishment of the new party  distinguished themselves by minimal activism in protecting the  environment, and their departure represents no loss for the SZS  from this viewpoint.</p>

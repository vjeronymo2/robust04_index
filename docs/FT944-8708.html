			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: DTI looks into fall in Aerostructures shares The Department of Trade and Industry is looking into the collapse in Aerostructures Hamble's share price, according to a letter to a Labour MP. Mr Jonathan Evans, corporate affairs minister, says in the letter that 'officials are currently considering the various press reports and information available from other sources which might enable them to determine whether or not further action should be taken.' Aerostructures was floated at 120p a share in June. Last month it issued a second profits warning following production difficulties. The shares, which closed at 26p yesterday, fell to 24p. Mr John Denham, MP for Southampton Itchen, wrote to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, last month calling for a DTI inquiry into the flotation of the Southampton aircraft components maker. Mr Evans' reply said the whole affair raised 'a number of apparently serious issues - two of which you identify in your letter - and in studying the available information my officials are taking full account of your, and your constituents', legitimate concerns.' Mr Denham's letter said that the company's employees, many of whom live in his constituency, were worried about the implications of the share collapse for the future of the company. They were also concerned that it could happen so soon after the flotation, which had left several directors with substantial personal profits. Yesterday Mr Denham said he hoped the DTI would quickly establish whether there were grounds for further action. While the first concern should be to see the company build a successful future, legitimate questions had been raised by the share collapse. It was 'in everyone's interests to have the matter resolved.' Aerostructures is still seeking a new chief executive to replace Mr Andy Barr, who accepted early retirement without compensation. Mr Barr made Pounds 1.75m from the flotation.</p>

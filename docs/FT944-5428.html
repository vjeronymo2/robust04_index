			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): Relief for adventurers - High risk investments / The new tax advantages for investors in small, unquoted companies THE MEASURE: Better tax breaks for investing in small unquoted companies via the enterprise investment scheme (EIS) and venture capital trusts (VCTs). The chancellor added capital gains tax re-investment relief to the 20 per cent up-front income tax relief available already on investments of up to Pounds 100,000 through the EIS. Investors in VCTs - which come into existence on April 6 - will be entitled to the same combination of 20 per cent up-front relief on investments up to Pounds 100,000, plus CGT re-investment relief, as well as tax-free income and capital gains from the trust. In both cases, the initial income tax relief applies only if the investments are held for at least five years. WHAT IT MEANS: Re-investment relief (or 'rollover relief') from CGT is an idea the chancellor introduced in the 1993 Budget. It allows investors to defer a CGT liability on gains made from any investment - shares, art works, a second home - if the gains are re-invested in an unquoted trading company. Initially, the relief was limited to direct investments in companies not using the EIS, but this has now been broadened to include both the EIS and VCTs. As CGT is charged at 40 per cent, this means that when re-investment relief is combined with the 20 per cent up-front tax relief on EIS companies or VCTs, investors may be entitled to a total of 60 per cent tax relief. And as each person is entitled to relief on investments of up to Pounds 100,000 a year in both EIS companies and VCTs, this adds up to 60 per cent tax relief on investments of Pounds 200,000 a year. The tax charge on gains rolled over into EIS companies, VCTs or other unquoted companies does not disappear, however: it is merely postponed until the investor disposes of the new investment. In any case, the shares must be held for at least five years to qualify for the 20 per cent income tax relief. If you have subscribed already for shares in a company issued under the EIS, you might still be able to take advantage of the new rollover relief. This applies to investments disposed of on, or after, Budget day; but it is available when the subscription for shares under the EIS is made up to one year before, or three years after, the disposal. This Budget also made it easier for companies to qualify under EIS rules by relaxing restrictions on property-holding. Previously, a company lost EIS status if, at any stage, land or buildings accounted for more than half its assets. This was intended to rule out low risk schemes which proliferated under the predecessor to the EIS, the business expansion scheme (BES) - such as companies buying properties to let out under assured short-term tenancy agreements. Given, however, that business premises are often a company's biggest asset, this rule ended up disqualifying many companies which fell within the scope intended originally by the chancellor. Companies specialising in letting out residential property will still be excluded from the EIS. A few other minor changes were made to relax the EIS rules concerning companies under common control, rights issues, and mergers. In the first 11 months of its life, the EIS has not attracted investors at the same rate as the BES. Most industry insiders have blamed this lack of success on the tighter rules (which mean that only companies at the riskier end of the old BES spectrum can qualify for the EIS), and on the lack of generous sweeteners. Likewise, when the outline proposals for VCTs were published, offering only tax-free income and capital gains but no up-front relief, many people voiced doubts about whether Pep-style tax breaks would be enough to entice investors into the much riskier territory of venture capital. The Budget changes go at least some way towards rectifying those situations. But investors should not throw caution to the wind. Albert Nawrocki, senior tax manager at accountant Binder Hamlyn, warns: 'Whilst the tax advantages obviously make both the venture capital trusts and EIS much more attractive, investors should not lose sight of the commercial viability of the underlying investment.' EIS companies and VCTs are very high-risk investments. Both are ways of generating money for small businesses in an early stage of their development. Companies which have used the EIS so far have been involved in activities ranging from film production, stubble-burning, pub management, and even promoting a new type of musical instrument. These are hardly mainstream investments, and there is no protection for investors in the not-so-unlikely event of their collapse. The one consolation is that with the EIS, unlike the BES, losses can be offset against CGT or income tax. Yet, offsetting a loss is hardly the same as making a profit. VCTs will invest in similar small developing companies. Although VCTs spread the risk a little by giving investors stakes in a range of companies, a few of the investments are almost bound to fail - so investors must hope the performance of the successes will more than make up for the failures. An additional complication is that because VCTs will function like normal investment trusts, it is likely their shares will trade at a discount to net asset value - so, within a few weeks of launch, investors could see their holding fall in value by 10 or 15 per cent. This could wipe out much of the benefit of the initial income tax relief (which is available only to investors subscribing for new shares in a trust, not to anyone buying shares in the market). The value might not be recovered for several years, if ever. If any of these prospects worry you, you should stick to other tax-efficient investments like Tessas and Peps. Always remember that no matter how generous the tax incentives, you should never be tempted by them into making an investment you would not have considered otherwise.</p>

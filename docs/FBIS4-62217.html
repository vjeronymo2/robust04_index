			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS - Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's far  rightist Liberal-Democratic party of Russia [LDPR] suggested  conducting a police operation to clean sweep Moscow of  criminals. For this purpose a special regime should be imposed  on the Russian capital similar to the one which was in effect  during Olympic games of 1980.    The LDPR faction in the State Duma suggested today that the  parliament should consider a bill on the special regime in  Moscow for a term of six months.    "During this period of time the government of Moscow backed  by law enforcement bodies could cleanse the capital of all guest  criminals and socially dangerous elements", a statement of the  LDPR press sevice said on Thursday.    Zhirinovskiy's party believes such measure "will be praised  by Muscovites who are living now under conditions of the  unprecedented orgy of crime, violence, and hooliganism".    According to the press service, Muscovites "identify this  orgy with the present rule of democrats".    Back in 1980, a few weeks before the begining of the Olympic  games Moscow police and security staged a remarkable operation  evacuating practically all prostitutes, tramps and petty  criminals to at least 100 kilometres from Moscow. The operation  was a success and carried out within a few days. But, of  course, it was far less prostitutes and tramps in Moscow in 1980  than it is now.</p>

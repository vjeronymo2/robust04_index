			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Gas companies reject price fears RIVAL GAS companies yesterday attacked claims by British Gas that the introduction of competition to the household supply market would mean higher prices for large groups of customers. 'These statements are not true, but British Gas is scoring some good points with them,' said Mr Peter Bryant, deputy chairman of Utilicorp UK, which has linked up with six regional electricity companies in order to enter the domestic supply market. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission recommended on Tuesday in two reports on the gas industry that household customers be given a free choice of supplier by 2002. It also quoted in its reports figures by British Gas showing that prices for 1.4m of its customers using small amounts of gas would double in a free market. A further 60 per cent of the company's 18m consumers could be worse off. The commission said that although prices could go up in the shorter term, the introduction of competition would bring the prospect of price reduction in the long run. Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, denied allegations of scaremongering. 'We've said all along the removal of the monopoly should only take place after the government has given careful consideration to all these issues,' he said. Competitors disagree with claims that they will only be looking to cherry-pick in a competitive market and supply the most profitable customers. Rival suppliers say they are already delivering gas to some high-volume domestic customers who have seen savings of between 10 per cent and 12 per cent. Competitors are also annoyed at claims that prices will rise in a more competitive market. They believe it could deter the government from opening up household supplies.</p>

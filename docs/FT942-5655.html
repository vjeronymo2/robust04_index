			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Indian government ahead of the game with rupee 'dilemma' Sir, Your leader ('India's rupee dilemma', May 27) doubted the seriousness of India's present government. But as early as last August, the Indian press reported a visit to the ministry of finance by John Williamson of Washington, who is one of the world experts on the capital flows which you discuss. To my mind, somebody in the Indian government was well ahead of the game. I suggest, moreover, that they have stayed ahead. You might have mentioned debt repayment as another way of reducing the problem. In fact, the government has recently done some of that. The leader also said that the country needs to find ways of using foreign capital. Such as investment in electricity, telecoms, oil and gas, aviation? All of these have already been opened up by the Rao government. And as an example of another encouraging fact, may I add that while the rest of the world's exports to India stagnated last year, exporters in the UK earned nearly 20 per cent more from India than in 1992 (the total was Pounds 1.1bn). In the first quarter of 1994, the British continued to help the Indians with their rupee problem: Britain's exports to them were up by 29 per cent.

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Flight plan is filed GUINNESS Flight is the latest unit trust company to launch a combined bond and equity fund attached to a personal equity plan. The attraction of such funds is that they can offer a higher yield than many conventional Peps (5.7 per cent after charges in Guinness Flight's case) without taking high risks. Provided the new fund, called the Equity &amp; Bond income trust, holds more than 50 per cent in equities, it will qualify for Pep status. In fact, the aim is to hold around 60 per cent in equities. Investors do not get something for nothing, of course; the higher yield comes at the expense of the prospects for capital growth. But with base rates at 6 per cent, many investors might well be attracted by a 5.7 per cent tax-free yield, paid quarterly. The charges on the fund depend on whether you take the Pep option. If you do, the initial charge is 2 per cent (reduced to 1.5 per cent until the offer period ends on June 25); if you want only the unit trust, the charge is 5 per cent (cut to 3.5 per cent during the offer period). The annual management fee is 1 per cent on the unit trust, with an additional 0.25 per cent on the Pep. There are also exit fees for Pep investors if they want to withdraw money in the early years: 3 per cent in year one, 2 per cent in year two and 1 per cent in year three. The minimum investment in the trust is Pounds 1,000; for Pep investors, it is Pounds 3,000, or Pounds 100 a month. How does the fund compare with three similar products launched earlier this year from Cazenove, Fidelity and M &amp; G? The charging structure is very similar to Fidelity's, as is the yield (Fidelity pays around 5.8 per cent at present), but Fidelity offers the facility to pay income monthly. Cazenove's Bond &amp; Utility fund offers a higher yield - 7 per cent - caused, in part, by its lower charges. Some investors, however, may like the wider spread of equities on offer from Guinness Flight. Its fund invests in a wide range of high-yielding stocks instead of limiting itself to utilities such as BT or the water stocks. The M &amp; G Managed Income fund yields only 4.13 per cent and has higher initial and annual charges. But it has a higher proportion of equities than any of the other funds and offers better scope for capital growth.</p>

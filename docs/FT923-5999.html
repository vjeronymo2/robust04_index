			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Arts: Today's Television The first hot ticket at this year's Edinburgh Festival was for the flamenco dancer Cristina Hoyos. Anyone who missed her there can catch up on Channel 4 tonight at 11.00 in El Amor Brujo. She stars in this dramatisation of Manuel de Falla's Spanish folk tale, directed by Carlos Saura, best known for his films Carmen and Blood Wedding, which also featured flamenco dancers. Survival (ITV at 7.30) really gets away from it all, going not just to Antarctica but underneath that continent. Holes are sawed through the ice to allow scuba divers to explore with their cameras one of the few natural environments yet to be contaminated by man. There is still plenty of carnage going on, with seals hunting cod and the Antarctic robber fish eating virtually everything. Pictures of penguins provide light relief. These days persuade David Jason to appear in a TV series and it seems destined to be a smash hit. But Jason worked his way through the ranks. In tonight's Porridge (BBC 1 at 9.30) he has a bit part as an old con who is reluctant to leave prison. These repeats of the 1970s classic comedy series are holding up very well.</p>

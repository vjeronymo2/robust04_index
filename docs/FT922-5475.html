			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Travel: In the lap of luxury IF I WERE planning a honeymoon, which I'm not, I would be tempted to swan from one Relais &amp; Chateaux hotel to another until the money ran out. It would evaporate fairly quickly, but I would live like a hog. All up, there are 387 R&amp;C hotels and restaurants in 40 countries, including 28 in Britain and Ireland. What they offer is immense attention to detail, unabashed comfort, and first-class food. Recently, I stayed in four R&amp;C hotels: one in France, two in Germany and one in Belgium. I was due to stay in a fifth: Hotel Schloss Durnstein near Krems, in north-eastern Austria. But I was very late arriving, and a mega-storm was raging. I could not find Durnstein, but am sure that its R&amp;C establishment is as impressive as the others. The first one I stayed in was the Royal Champagne, in the heart of Champagne country, between Reims and Epernay. The hotel is a former 18th century staging post. It has 24 rooms with views over the vineyards. Room rates range from FFr830 (Pounds 83.75) to FFr1,350 , and the cooking is profoundly accomplished. Stay as long as you can. Petit dejeuner: FFr70. Tel: 26.52.87.11. Fax: 26.52.89.69. My next stop was Brenner's Park-Hotel in Baden-Baden: very grand (100 rooms), very quiet (it is in a large private park facing Lichtentaler Allee and the River Oos), yet central. A booklet published in 1972 to mark the hotel's centenary said that clients of Brenner's Park 'do not sit at the wheel of their cars when they drive up. That is not considered in good taste. They arrive in taxis or are driven by a chauffeur who can chat with colleagues in a special social room provided for this purpose.' No wonder I felt grubby arriving in my Rover; but no-one threw me out. The food is excellent. Room rates for a twin room with bath range from DM410 (Pounds 139.40) to DM1,500, depending on category and season. Breakfast: DM32. Parking: DM25 per day. The high season runs until November 30; also December 15-January 6. There is a 20 per cent room surcharge when the Baden-Baden horseracing is on (autumn meeting: August 28-September 7). Tel: (07221)-9000. Fax: 38772. From Baden-Baden I drove to Austria. On the way back I stayed at a third R&amp;C hotel, the Schlosshotel Kronberg, not far from Frankfurt, set in the middle of extensive parkland which contains an 18-hole golf course. The schloss was built at the end of the last century for Empress Friedrich, and is glamorous and atmospheric. Again, first-class cooking. There are 24 single rooms (DM260-DM365), 27 doubles (DM380-DM600), and six suites (DM840-DM1,600). Breakfast: DM25. Tel: (06173)-70101, fax: (06173)-701267. Finally, I spent a virtuous night at the impeccable Hostellerie Berkenhof at Keerbergen, 30 minutes north-east of Brussels. The proprietor, Jean-Pierre Koch, is also the Relais &amp; Chateaux president for Belgium and Luxemburg. As the press release says: 'In cuisine, he detests routine and has banished sauce-based recipes from his repertoire, plunges into improvisations and masters the best produce the region offers. An expert in the art of receiving guests . . . Jacqueline Koch manages a motivated staff and 10 beautiful rooms.' A double room costs BFr4,500 (Pounds 74.53) to BFr6,000. Tel: (015)-730101. Fax: (015)-730202. Michael Thompson-Noel crossed from Dover to Calais with Sealink Stena Line, which has introduced a two-stage discount and customer loyalty programme on all routes. Sealink's Compass Points Blue Card scheme offers savings up to 20 per cent. Frequent travellers who use their blue cards to make six return or 12 single journeys qualify for a gold card, offering 25 per cent discounts. Points are awarded to all cardholders at the rate of a point per Pounds 1 spent. Sealink bookings: 0233-647047.</p>

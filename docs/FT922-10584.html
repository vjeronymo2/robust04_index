			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (12): Moving closer to the customers - Staff relocations are seldom easy, but in a phased move, Norwich Union's first wave of employees to Sheffield 'has eased the fears of the waverers' NORWICH UNION'S decision to transfer a large slice of its life and pensions operation from Norwich to Sheffield was based on both economic and strategic considerations. However, as with most relocations that are taking place during this recession, the economic considerations no longer apply with quite the force they once did. In the time-lag between the decision to move and the move itself, the pressures which contributed to the decision have receded. Office rents in Norwich have fallen substantially over the past 18 months, while in Sheffield they have actually risen. The difficulty of recruiting skilled staff, one of the prime factors in the relocation decision, has also been eased - this time by rising unemployment. Indeed, the job market has changed so much that the company's initial plan to recruit most of its Sheffield workforce locally has now been changed. Most of the 800 jobs involved will now go to those who relocate. The strategic considerations, however, are unchanged. The company argues that to service its customers, it needs to be geographically close to them and a substantial operation in the north has long been seen as desirable. The relocation involves the transfer of all the life and pensions administration for the north-east and north-west regions. The choice of Sheffield as a location was not made as the result of 'a beauty contest.' Norwich Union had already expanded into the city in the late 1980s, setting up an operation to service new distribution channels, such as direct marketing and direct sales. It saw the relocation as an opportunity to build on this presence. Detailed planning for the move began in November 1990. It was approached as a dual-track project management programme, with each region's move being co-ordinated separately under a core team of senior managers. This approach means that both regions must co-ordinate activity, if only to sort out practical matters such as which floors of the new building are to be occupied by which region. Overall project management is controlled from Norwich. The main challenge was to move staff within an 18-month timescale, whilst keeping fully operational. The fact that there will be some members of staff  -though fewer than originally anticipated - meant that the option of transferring within a shorter time-frame did not exist. The company decided on a phased relocation, using a three-month work cycle. Sections of the operation are being moved and given time to gel, before the work is transferred from Norwich. The first sections moved to the city last July. At present, the north-east region is half way through its relocation, with the north-west region due to follow next year. Curiously, the north-east region is moving temporarily into an existing Sheffield office building. The eventual home of both regions will be a new 180,000 sq ft complex now being built on the site of the former Rabone Chesterman tape measure factory. The company will be a tenant in the scheme at a rent of around Pounds 14 a sq ft, one of the highest rents ever achieved in Sheffield. The operation will barely have time to settle before it is uprooted to its permanent home, yet Martyn James, who is in charge of relocation the north-east region, sees few difficulties. 'I think moving from Norwich to Sheffield is a great deal more complex than moving within a city centre. Our next move will be like any other business moving into new premises,' he says. During the planning stage, Norwich Union examined several large relocations, but failed to find anything upon which it could base the project management of its own move. 'We looked at a lot of relocations, but couldn't find anything that paralleled our own. As an organisation we are fairly used to moving people around, so we actually have managers who know about relocation,' he says. Martyn James acknowledges that one of the most difficult aspects of the move was the initial task of finding people prepared to relocate voluntarily. The original idea to take only those with core skills changed with the recession, and more staff had to be persuaded to relocate. The company, having told all its staff about the plan, advertised internally for volunteers. This was followed by a presentation evening in Norwich at which estate agents and educationalists from Sheffield gave brief descriptions of the city's strengths. Coach trips to Sheffield were then arranged to allow staff to discover the city for themselves. The relocation package which the company already offers some key staff was extended to all those willing to move north. This included a disturbance allowance, up to three weeks hotel accommodation, all removal and legal expenses and, for those with homes to sell, a guaranteed purchaser. Despite these efforts, James admits a little disappointment at the take up - 'we would have liked more people to have come forward, but Norwich and Sheffield are very very different places. There were a lot of preconceptions.' The phased nature of the move, he says, has helped considerably. The first wave of relocating staff has eased the fears of the waverers - 'as we get more people up here, a more positive message begins to get across.' Thus far, he is delighted with the way the project is progressing and says there have been few unforeseen problems. 'We always planned to do the move over 18 months, rather than trying to do too much in one go. What we have tried to do is to start as small as possible and build up from there.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by All India Radio special correspondent Bhupal </F> Inder Saini]    [Text] The prime minister is today launching upon two days  of intensive interaction with decision makers in the United  States -- both in the political and economic spheres. Mr.  Narasimha Rao will first of all address the joint meeting of  both houses of the U.S. Congress today. He will be the first  prime minister of any country to get the opportunity since Mr.  Clinton took over as U.S. president. Mr. Narasimha Rao is  expected to utilize it to spell out India's views on the  emerging world scenario -- both in the political and economic  fields as well as regional and bilateral issues.    Significantly, the prime minister's address to the Congress  became possible after several American senators as well members  of the House of Representatives expressed their wish to hear in  person the prime minister of the largest democracy in the world.  It was not on the original schedule earlier. Mr. Narasimha Rao  will have his first meeting with President Clinton tomorrow,  when they have talks at the White House. After having lunch  together, the two leaders will address a joint news conference.  An atmosphere conducive to an open and frank Indo-U.S. dialogue  has been created with both sides making clear their views on  major world and regional issues. There is a large area of  agreement though there are differences in perspective on some  issues. Both sides recognized that there is need to make the  world a secure place free from a threat of major conflagration.  There is need for disarmament, especially in the nuclear field.    India has made it clear that it is prepared to discuss the  question of disarmament, including nuclear nonproliferation, but  real world security can be established in a comprehensive  nondiscriminatory framework only. The Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty -- NPT -- is unacceptable to India in its present form as  it is discriminatory and seeks to divide the world permanently  into two categories -- the nuclear haves and havenots. The  Clinton Administration, which was earlier pressing for a  regional NPT for South Asia has now shown understanding of  India's viewpoint that such an arrangement cannot work. Nuclear  weapons cannot be banished from the region just by two countries  signing the NPT or a regional variation.    Another major focus of Mr. Narasimha Rao's visit is on  strengthening Indo-American business ties. A large number of  top Indian industrialists and business people are now in  Washington having talks with their American counterparts on  joint ventures and tie-ups. The finance minister, Dr. Manmohan  Singh, is also in the American capital to clear any doubts about  the far-reaching character of India's economic reforms. The  United States is already India's largest trading partner. But a  full potential for greater economic cooperation is yet to be  tapped. Hopefully, the interaction during Mr. Narasimha Rao's  visit will lead to increased trade and economic cooperation.</p>

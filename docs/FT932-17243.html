			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Carter Holt Harvey sells stake in mill CARTER Holt Harvey (CHH), a New Zealand forestry group, yesterday sold its remaining 10 per cent interest in Pan Pac Mill, a sawn timber and wood pulp mill, to its former Japanese joint-venture partners for NZDollars 20m (USDollars 10.7m), writes Terry Hall in Wellington. The mill, one of the largest in New Zealand, was developed by Carter family interests in the 1960s as a joint venture with Oji Paper and Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp. CHH originally held 60 per cent of the venture. However, in early 1991, when CHH faced financial problems following its takeover of rival NZ Forest Products, it agreed to sell 50 per cent of Pan Pac to the Japanese partners for NZDollars 50m on condition it could buy the holding back on March 31 this year.</p>

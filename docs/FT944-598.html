			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Food and Drink: Why the next two vintages are crucial - Jancis Robinson with the final part of an article on trends in Australian wines The words 'cautious' and 'nervous' are two unlikely adjectives which accurately describe Australia's wine exporters at the moment. For the past few years they have been justifiably gung-ho, with wine exports having risen tenfold since 1985 to represent almost one bottle in every four produced. Their much-vaunted plan is to continue to woo overseas wine-drinkers to the tune of ADollars 1bn in total wine exports by 2000, but they are hitting a few snags - even discounting a couple of natural disasters. Frost dinted next year's vintage prospects in the all-important Barossa Valley, the most famous wine region in the wine state, South Australia; and a severe drought could well reduce the 1995 vintage in a country that is already short of the premium grapes on which its export sales depend. There has been a fury of new plantings, which will increase acreage by a good 7 per cent (so much so that many fear there will be a grape glut in five years) but they will not come into production in time to halt a spiral in grape prices for the 1995 and 1996 vintages. Almost all wine producers depend heavily on grape growers, and paid them an average of 33 per cent more between June 1993 and June 1994, while average domestic wine prices rose just 6 per cent and export prices rose an almost unnoticeable 1 per cent. Vines take three years to produce a viable crop, so plantings tend to reflect demand with a pronounced lag. Fuelled by 1980s fashions, everyone has been planting Chardonnay, so the most acute medium-term shortages are predicted for premium red varieties such as Shiraz and Pinot Noir. At the bottom end of the market, there is no lack of basic cheap Sultana and Muscat grapes (which alternate between supplying the wine and dried grape markets). It could be that Australia's fate in the big, bad wine world over the next year or so will depend on producers resisting the temptation to stretch the good with the heavily irrigated and distinctly less good. Australians, like European wine producers, are allowed to blend in up to a total of 15 per cent of grapes, vintages and regions other than those specified on the label, but the catch-all 'South Eastern Australia' appellation, devised for export, allows producers to source grapes more or less anywhere except the isolated and relatively limited vineyards of Western Australia. Australian wine folk, almost all of them male, are inveterate travellers. There is already considerable discontent within Australia about 'flying winemakers.' These antipodean experts make wine in Europe during their quiet winter back home, but there is concern that their activities are simply diluting Australia's technical advantages by exporting them to its commercial rivals, many of them with lower cost-bases. Having themselves put pressure on the French in the late 1980s, Australian exporters are all too well aware of the increased competition their wines face from South America, South Africa, southern France and Eastern Europe in the mid 1990s. They have won a 6 per cent share of the precious UK market from a standing start, but on the basis of offering real value for money. Many industry figures are concerned about how they will keep this enviable reputation as prices rise. 'We have no alternative but to increase prices,' maintains Robin Day, managing director of Pernod-Ricard's Orlando, whose Jacob's Creek range has become Britain's most popular brand of bottled wine. 'We simply can't afford to absorb any more results of the currency movements and the grape shortage.' Brian Croser, who successfully negotiated a halt in the rise of domestic wine tax in late 1993, is also chairman of the commercially significant Royal Adelaide Wine Show. He had to report that this year's judging marathon resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of gold medals awarded in the cheaper wine classes, of wines destined both for export and domestic markets. 'Australia has entered dangerous commercial territory,' he warned his fellow wine producers. 'The thing central to our success - premium varietal wines at good prices - is vanishing. As the cost-accountants rampage through our cellars, we are becoming producers of FAQ (fair average quality) wines. We must be careful as a viticultural nation that we don't lose sight of why our wines have been successful on export markets.' If by any chance the British did fall out of love with Australian wine (and nearly half the exports from Australia/New Zealand went to the UK last year), things could be very grim for the Australian market. The relatively static domestic market Down Under would find it extremely difficult to absorb the quantities involved without a repeat of the dumping which ruined the market in its last down-swing.</p>

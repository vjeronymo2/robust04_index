			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bunzl expands via Pounds 17m buy BUNZL is expanding its paper and plastics business into the UK with the planned acquisition of GKN's paper operations for Pounds 16.75m. The acquisition is being funded by a placing of 13m shares at 129p. The group's shares slipped a 1p to 133p . Mr Anthony Habgood, chief executive, said that while the amount was quite small to raise from shareholders it was 'helpful rather than potentially harmful to the balance sheet'. The group's debt of about Pounds 100m at the year end represents gearing of 50 per cent. Bunzl's biggest earner is its paper and plastics operations, which last year increased operating profit from Pounds 28.4m to Pounds 31.6m. The acquisition of GKN's paper and plastics operations, called ACS, gives the group a foothold in the UK industry which is estimated to be worth about Pounds 500m. Mr Habgood said: 'It opens new horizons in a very big market.' Bunzl's current paper and plastics operations have been restricted to the US and Australia. ACS's operating profit declined from Pounds 3m to Pounds 2.5m at the end of last year. Mr Habgood said: 'It is easy not to get all the love and attention needed to flourish when a business is not regarded as core and has been up for sale for some time.' In spite of what he called a 'tough economic environment' Mr Habgood said Bunzl had traded strongly during the year.</p>

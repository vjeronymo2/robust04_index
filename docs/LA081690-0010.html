			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: FLYING OFF HANDLE OVER AIR FARES  </P> <P> I took my friend Pierce to the airport the other day. He was flying coach from  Boston to Los Angeles. The gentleman behind the counter said, "That will be  $700."  </P> <P> Pierce exclaimed, "Seven-hundred dollars! I'm not flying by Concorde."  </P> <P> The man replied, "That is our special summer rate fare for tourist class."  </P> <P> "It's outrageous," Pierce blurted. "How can you charge someone $700 for that  flight?"  </P> <P> The man said, "You are our only paying flyer. Everyone else is either a free  mileage passenger or an employee of the airline heading back home."  </P> <P> Pierce asked: "Don't you have people who purchase their tickets anymore?"  </P> <P> "Hardly ever. It's refreshing to meet someone like you who isn't looking for a  free lunch."  </P> <P> "Since I'm the only paying passenger on the flight, couldn't I be upgraded from  tourist to first class?"  </P> <P> "I hardly think so. Most of our upgrades are people who have 60,000 miles in  credit and have slept in a Hilton Hotel for three nights. They naturally get  priority over someone like yourself who is paying cash for his seat."  </P> <P> "How does an airline earn money when it gives away all its flights?"  </P> <P> "We make our profit on cheap maintenance. What we lose on fares we save in our  hangars."  </P> <P> I said to Pierce, "It looks as if you don't have any choice."  </P> <P> Pierce spoke up, "Wait a minute. How long will it take before I fly for free?"  </P> <P> The clerk looked in his book. "I would say two more flights should do it,  providing you eat at a Red Lobster restaurant and see Dick Tracy 16 times. We  have tie-ins with everyone for our 'Come Fly With Me' August free-fall  program."  </P> <P> "OK," said Pierce. "Give me a ticket."  </P> <P> As the man wrote it out, he murmured, "We would prefer if you didn't mention to  the other passengers that you paid for your seat."  </P> <P> Pierce went red. "Why not?"  </P> <P> "Because they'll think you're a snob. Most of our free flyers are very proud,  and they won't sit next to people who bought their tickets."  </P> <P> "You just made me pay $700 for a trip to L.A., and now you tell me I can't talk  about it?"  </P> <P> "It's not an FAA regulation, but it has been our experience that people who  have purchased their tickets at full price are considered dumb, and no one has  respect for them."  </P> <P> Pierce said: "I don't see any humor in this. If you really cared about paying  passengers, you would give them the red carpet so everyone in the airport would  know who we are."  </P> <P> "We don't want to start a precedent. If we give paying passengers the royal  treatment, then our employees will demand the same thing, and we can't offend  them because they take up a lot of free seats on our planes. You ought to feel  lucky I sold you a ticket. I have someone who won a trip on 'Wheel of Fortune'  who is waiting on standby for your seat."  </P> <P> "Why did you take me over him?" Pierce wanted to know.  </P> <P> "Because the FAA insists we keep a number of seats aside in case some sucker  wants to pay."  </P></p>

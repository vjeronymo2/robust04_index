			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments stated that the rule should be amended to state specific guidelines that asylum officers must follow in deciding whether to refer cases to an immigration judge. According to these comments, it is unclear whether the application will be judged under the standard of well-founded fear of persecution set forth in section 101(a)(42) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. &sect;1101(a)(42), or under some other discretionary standard. Some comments also stated that asylum officers may rely on improper factors such as instinct, prejudice, or misinformation in making referral decisions. The comments suggested that a written record of the reasons for referral, provided to the applicant, would be fairer to applicants and would increase confidence in the referral system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several comments also criticized the provision for automatic referral of the asylum application to an immigration judge. The comments argued that in the course of exclusion or deportation proceedings, the asylum application is defensive in nature, and the applicant should be able to decide whether to use the application in the proceedings. The comments also stated that initial asylum applications are often erroneous or incomplete, not because the applicant intends to commit fraud, but because the applicant does not know English and has used a preparer who did not complete the application correctly. The comments suggested that the applicant referred to an immigration judge be able to submit an entirely new application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response and Disposition:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule does not change the legal standard for granting asylum set forth in sections 101(a)(42) and 208(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(42) and 1158(a), and 8 CFR 208.13 and 208.14: asylum officers will continue to abide by this standard. Those who have met the burden of proof to establish that they are refugees will continue to be granted asylum. Those who have not met their burden of proof will be referred to an immigration judge or, in the case of those with a current lawful immigration status, will be issued a denial letter. The rule should create no reason for concern that factors other than those set forth in the law and regulations will influence the decisions of asylum officers. Accordingly, there is no reason to provide any additional regulatory guidelines for asylum officer decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have declined to adopt the recommendation that the applications of referred applicants not be forwarded to an immigration judge. A referred applicant may decline to seek asylum in the course of exclusion or deportation proceedings and, if so, can simply move to withdraw the application. However, if the applicant desires to proceed with the application, he or she should be held accountable for the information that has been provided on the initial application. During the immigration court proceedings, the applicant can provide additional information and explain any errors or inconsistencies in the application. In addition, section 208.2(b) of this rule has been amended to provide that an immigration judge, as a matter of discretion, may permit the applicant to amend the I&hyph;589 prior to the hearing on the merits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule would have provided that the INS inform an applicant by letter of the decision to refer his or her case, accompanied by a charging document. The INS will consider the recommendation that the letter state briefly the reasons why the application has not been granted. However, the INS believes that a regulatory standard mandating the contents of the referral letter is not necessary to preserve the procedural rights of applicants and may impede the flexibility that will be necessary to ensure that applicants receive their decisions in a prompt manner. The INS will continue to work with attorneys, advocacy groups, and other interested members of the public on this question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This provision of the proposed rule will be adopted in the final rule with one substantive amendment. The amendment will specify that an application may be referred to an immigration judge for adjudication in exclusion or deportation proceedings if, in accordance with 8 CFR 208.10, the applicant is deemed to have waived his or her right to an interview on the application under 8 CFR 208.9(a). In addition, this paragraph has been reorganized and sub-divided for clarity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 14. Eligibility Restrictions for Persons Convicted of Aggravated Felonies (Sections 208.14(d)(4) and 208.16(c)(2)(ii))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Proposed Rule:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would have added a new paragraph 208.14(d)(4) that would bar individuals who have been convicted of an aggravated felony from applying for or being granted asylum. Proposed 8 CFR 208.16(c)(2)(ii) would bar such individuals from applying for or being granted withholding of deportation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments proposed that this portion of the rule be amended. Some comments stated that the effect of the rule is too harsh and that those convicted of an aggravated felony should be able to present their asylum claims. The INS should then balance the likelihood and seriousness of persecution against the gravity of the crime committed by the individual. These comments stated that this approach is supported by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Some comments also argued that the rule should apply only to convictions entered after November 19, 1988, the date of enactment of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&hyph;690, which added section 101(a)(43) to the Act to define ``aggravated felony.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43). These comments argued that application of the aggravated felony ban to convictions entered on or before November 19, 1988, is inconsistent with the holding in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Landgraf  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> USI Film Products,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 114 S.

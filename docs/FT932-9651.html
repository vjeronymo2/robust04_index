			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Maverick guerrillas launch fierce bombardment on Kabul Maverick guerrilla groups launched a fierce bombardment of the Afghan capital Kabul before dawn yesterday, killing at least 15 people and injuring hundreds, Reuter reports from Kabul. It was the fiercest battle since the fractious guerrilla leaders of the Islamic coalition government signed a pact in Pakistan in March to end months of fighting. Over 300 rockets and shells hit Kabul before dawn. Government tanks raced to reinforce the main battlefront in the south-western suburbs. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reported 576 injured in the shell-shattered capital. Doctors earlier reported 15 dead but said later the figure would be much higher. Most of the rockets were fired from positions of the Iran-backed Shia Hezb-i-Wahdat group and the hardline Hezb-i-Islami party led by Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, prime minister-designate, in hills to the south and west. President Burhanuddin Rabbani and Mr Hekmatyar were in the eastern city of Jalalabad for a 12th day of talks to try to break the deadlock over formation of a cabinet under the terms of the March peace agreement. International response to a UN appeal for humanitarian aid for Afghanistan has been 'disgraceful,' Oxfam director Mr David Bryer said yesterday.</p>

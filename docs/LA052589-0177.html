			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: VENICE;  </P> <P> PLANS FOR BEACH PARKING  </P> <P> A bus shuttle program, a traffic crisis management team and more beach access  parking lots will be used to alleviate traffic problems in the Venice beach  area this summer, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter said.  </P> <P> The shuttle, in its third season of operation, starts at the parking lot on  Venice Boulevard near West Washington Boulevard. Rides will be scheduled every  15 minutes from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends and holidays through Labor Day.  The shuttle is free for those who pay $3 to park in the lot and 25 cents for  others.  </P> <P> Galanter's traffic management team, on duty on summer weekends, will consist of  a Department of Transportation traffic engineer who will monitor conditions in  the most heavily congested areas and work with traffic control officers to  direct traffic flow.  </P> <P> In addition, beach access parking lots will be posted, and negotiations are  under way with the Los Angeles Unified School District to use parking lots at  area elementary schools.  </P></p>

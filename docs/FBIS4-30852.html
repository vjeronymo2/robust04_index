			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marek Jaslan and "Kraj": "Guests From IMF Are </F> Coming; There Are Big Chances for Concluding an Agreement"]    [Text] Marcus Rodlauer, IMF's representative to  Poland, assesses positively the principles of the government's  economic policies for 1994-97, as well as the National Bank of  Poland's [NBP] monetary policies. But a lack of salary controls  in state-owned enterprises is cause for concern for Rodlauer.  According to him, this creates a danger of a price rise.    An IMF mission is coming to Poland tonight on a two-week  visit. It will be headed by Michael Deppler, a deputy director  at IMF's European Department. The IMF representatives will be  conducting talks at the individual ministries. The goal of the  talks is to become familiar with the current economic situation  in Poland and also with the government's economic principles for  the future. This is to lead to the signing of another agreement  between Poland and the IMF. There is a chance that this might  take place as early as August. Such a view is expressed among  others by Marcus Rodlauer, IMF's representative to Poland.    One of the items on the agenda for the IMF mission will be  to  become familiar in detail with the economic program that was  recently presented by Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister  and finance minister. According to Marcus Rodlauer, the  assumptions made in the program -- that is a rise in the GDP by  22 percent by 1997, and also a single-digit inflation figure in  the same year -- look quite realistic.    While assessing Poland's current economic situation,  Rodlauer  told ZYCIE WARSZAWY that Poland is one of the few European  countries with this kind of economic growth rate. "That is why  one must assess the government's economic policies positively,"  Rodlauer added. But there are still a number of problems that  the government will have to overcome, like the high inflation  rate, agricultural issues, or state-owned enterprises.    Salary policies are one of the most important issues to be  discussed by the IMF mission. Over the recent months, salaries  in state-owned enterprises were rising fast. Therefore, the IMF  experts will try to find out how the government intends to  control salaries over the next few months and over the long  term. According to Rodlauer, ignoring the problem may cause  danger to the economy. A high, uncontrolled rise in salaries,  may bring about a lower rate of economic growth, and may also  become the reason for a price jump.    Rodlauer has high praise of NBP's monetary policies. In his  view, the policies were consistent and cautious over the last  few months while the reduction in the denomination of the zloty  [elimination of the four last zeros] which is being planned for  the beginning of next year, should contribute to an increased  trust put in the currency.</p>

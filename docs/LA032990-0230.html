			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> TANTALIZING PITCH BY RYAN  </P> <P> Texas Rangers' star Nolan Ryan, baseball's all-time strikeout king, hinted at  retirement a few months ago but now says he might pitch beyond this season, the  Dallas Morning News reported today.  </P> <P> Dick Moss, Ryan's agent, met with Ranger general manager Tom Grieve on  Wednesday to discuss a contract extension for Ryan, the newspaper said. Ryan's  two-year contract expires after this season.  </P> <P> The 43-year-old Ryan "still feels pretty good," Moss said. "This is a nice  situation for Nolan. He loves it here with the Rangers. I think the club likes  having him, too. Something might happen."  </P></p>

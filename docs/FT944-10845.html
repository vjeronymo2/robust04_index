			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Boasting manufacturers get their nappies in a twist Forget soap wars. The latest battle is for babies' bottoms, as Pampers disposable nappies slug it out with rival brand Huggies, and both sides complain about their opponent's dirty tactics. Procter &amp; Gamble, which makes Pampers, complained to the Advertising Standards Authority, the advertising watchdog, about magazine advertisements from Huggies manufacturer, Kimberly-Clark. The advertisements claimed Huggies were 'significantly thinner than the leading nappy, yet incredibly, they keep your baby just as dry'. P&amp;G, which said the 'leading nappy' reference was clearly to its brand, Pampers, complained that the Kimberly-Clark claims were false. It replied by sending laboratory research to the watchdog in support of its advertisements. Kimberly-Clark submitted its own complaint to the watchdog about P&amp;G's advertising, objecting to magazine and direct-mail advertisements. The watchdog, which engaged its own nappy expert to evaluate the claims, concluded in its monthly report, released today, that the test results were not comparable. Both sides were sent away by the watchdog to see if they could agree a 'mutually acceptable testing procedure in order that such disputes could be resolved satisfactorily in future'. In the meantime, both parties were told by the authority not to claim 'anything more than an equal best ability to keep babies dry'. Calvin Klein Cosmetics was condemned by the watchdog for the way it used model Kate Moss in an advertisement for its fragrance, Obsession for Men. It said the model's naked pose, with her 'child-like form' and the brand name of the product, were 'inappropriate and irresponsible'. Some supermarkets use misleading 'basket-of-goods' price comparisons in their advertising, according to a survey by the watchdog. It said some advertisers were not comparing like with like.</p>

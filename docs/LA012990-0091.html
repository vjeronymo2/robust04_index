			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> REGION TRANSPORT BODY PLANNED  </P> <P> In an effort to reduce "bureaucratic gridlock," Southern California lawmakers  announced plans today to form a regional transportation authority for their  districts.  </P> <P> The new authority would be required to come up with a regional transportation  plan for the area. It also would have the final say -- and resolve differences  between cities and counties -- on all transportation issues in the counties of  Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura and Imperial.  </P> <P> The plan is expected to draw fierce opposition from the Los Angeles County  Transportation Commission, which would lose power, and from Orange County,  which has traditionally opposed having to take orders from a regional  authority.  </P></p>

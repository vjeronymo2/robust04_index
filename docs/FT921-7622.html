			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Allianz in DM1bn rights issue to fund expansion ALLIANZ, Europe's largest insurance company, is planning to raise more than DM1bn through a rights issue of new shares and profit-participating certificates. This is the Munich-based company's first capital-raising exercise since October 1990. It mostly reflects the costs of expansion into eastern Germany via the acquisition of Deutsche Versicherungs, the loss-making former east German state monopoly. Allianz said the issue would ensure its capital base expanded to keep pace with increasing business volume, and the proceeds would help meet the investment needed to integrate and develop Deutsche Versicherungs. The issue is to be on a 1-for-12 basis at DM700 a share, which compares with a closing price of DM2,306 yesterday, bringing in DM975m (Dollars 590.9m) for the company. Holders of profit-participating certificates will be offered new ones an the same 1-for-12 basis. The overall sum raised will be DM1.06bn. In December, Allianz agreed to pay the Treuhand privatisation agency DM440m for the outstanding 49 per stake in Deutsche Versicherungs. This was significantly more than the DM270.7m it paid for the first 51 per cent in June 1990, and more than Allianz had indicated that it wanted to pay in the light of heavy losses. At the time, analysts said Allianz was paying a 'political premium' for the right to acquire control over the former monopoly business. Although the acquisition has brought Allianz premium income of some DM1.8bn a year, Deutsche Versicherungs is unlikely to break even until 1995-96, by which time it is likely to have built up cumulative losses of DM1bn. Premium income is expected to grow to between DM3bn and DM3.5bn by 1995-96. At the moment, Allianz is thought to be losing DM30 for every DM100 premiums received. Last October, Allianz warned that losses in the east would mean that for 1991 it would register its first ever group loss on mainstream underwriting business.</p>

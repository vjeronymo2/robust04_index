			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Moscow (DDP/ADN) -- Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the  Russian parliament [State Duma], described relations  between Germany and Russia as exemplary. "There are good  opportunities to further develop the constructive and  businesslike relationship which also exists between the two  countries' parliaments," Rybkin said today in an interview with  the DDP/ADN news agency in Moscow. This aim will also be served  by his first visit to Germany as chairman of the State Duma.  Rybkin will come to Germany next week on Wednesday [11 June] as  the head of a Duma delegation.    Germany's experiences in the development of a democratic and  economically strong social state could be very useful for  Russia. "In this connection, we want to acquaint ourselves with  the move of the economy in the former East Germany from central  planning to market economy principles," said Rybkin, who was  elected chairman of the Duma on 14 January. The solution of  this problem is a priority for Russia, too, to further advance  reforms.    Rybkin, who described his relationship with President Boris  Yeltsin as "very good and constructive," came out in favor of  continuing the democratic and economic reforms in his country.  However, the changes must be well considered and implemented  with the required social provision. "The time of quick  decisions is past," the Duma chairman stressed. Russians have  the capabilities and the will decisively to improve their lives.  "But this requires effort from everyone every day -- from the  president down to the ordinary citizen."

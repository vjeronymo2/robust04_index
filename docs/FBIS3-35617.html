			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The press center of Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign  Affairs publicized a statement today from the Ukrainian Embassy  in the Republic of Poland. In particular, it reads that on 27  January 1994, the Polish newspapers ZYCIE WARSZAWY and SZTANDAR  MLODYCH published a report about a court case that was being  instigated against three Polish citizens on 31 January and that  they were being accused of smuggling. One of the accused  described himself as an agent of the Polish special services.  This gave the mentioned newspapers grounds for describing the  case as revenge for Lysenko and a Polish-Ukrainian smuggling and  espionage war.    The Ukrainian Embassy announced that the criminal case that  was initiated against the Polish smugglers over a year ago has  no bearing on the case of Major Anatoliy Lysenko. None of the  Polish citizens are being accused of espionage, and that is why  there can be no question of revenge or an espionage war. The  Ukrainian side regards the arrest of Major Lysenko as a spy to  be groundless, and that is why it has continuously demanded his  release.</p>

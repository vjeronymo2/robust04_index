			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Company News: Public offer considered in UPI rescue MR LEON Charney, a former adviser to the Carter administration who may launch a bid for United Press International, said he was considering a plan to revive the ailing news service through public offerings to subscribers and correspondents, AP-DJ reports. Under the plan, UPI would become a co-operative. Mr Charney, who recently provided Dollars 180,000 to keep UPI operating until June 22, yesterday met in Amsterdam with a representative of the National Postal Lottery, which may pump as much as Dollars 3.5m into UPI under a proposed rescue plan. The foundation raises money through lottery sales. The Dutch foundation's efforts are being led by Mr Bob Goldner, a former UPI executive, and Mr Julian Isherwood, a UPI journalist based in Copenhagen. It expects a restructured UPI to expand coverage of environmental and Third World issues. Mr Charney said an investment by the Dutch foundation, if it materialised, would provide funds to keep the news wire running for an extended period while detailed plans for a public offering could be worked out.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGES / ALAN DROOZ;  </P> <P> DOMINGUEZ HILLS TOURNEY A TOP DRAW  </P> <P> Cal State Dominguez Hills will be the site of one of the nation's premier  Division II women's volleyball fields this week when it plays host to the  nine-team Dominguez Hills Invitational Tournament.  </P> <P> The two-day tourney features five of the top 20 teams in Division II, led by  No. 1-ranked Sacramento State, No. 3 Regis College of Colorado, No. 8 UC  Riverside, No. 11 Cal Poly Pomona and No. 14 Chapman College.  </P> <P> In the three-pool format, each team will play twice today and then shift into  winners' and losers' brackets Saturday, with the six best teams forming one  round robin and the bottom three another. The championship game is scheduled  for 7:30 Saturday night.  </P> <P> The three opening-round pools will consist of Riverside, Cal State Los Angeles  and Alaska-Anchorage; Sacramento, Pomona and Dominguez Hills; and Regis, Sonoma  and Chapman. Play begins at 2 p.m. today and 10 a.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> The 3-7 Lady Toros picked up all three of their victories last week at the La  Verne Tournament. Their improvement coincided with the emergence of freshman  setter Jeanna Price. The newcomer from Lake Elsinore set a school record with  50 assists against Elizabethtown, needing only four games to reach that total.  The old school mark of 43 assists had been set in a five-game match.  </P> <P> "She'll probably break that record soon, too," said Coach Nancy Fortner. "We're  a better team (than previously), so we have longer rallies, and she just goes  after more balls."  </P> <P> Also on the rise for the young Lady Toros is sophomore hitter Lourdes Estrada,  who tops the team in kill percentage and has 10 service aces, and freshman  hitter Gale Derricott, who is first in kills (33) and digs (28). Sophomore  Angie Hamer has 27 kills and 23 digs.  </P> <P> Fortner starts only one senior, Julie Berthiaume. "This (tournament) is tough  competition," the coach said. "Realistically, we're going to have to work real  hard to advance in our pool. I'm hoping to give some of these teams some  trouble."  </P> <P> The Loyola Marymount women's volleyball team, which started 0-8 last year, is  off to a 4-6 start this year despite a tough early schedule.  </P> <P> It doesn't get any easier for new Coach Steve Stratos' improving team as the  Lions travel to Boulder, Colo., for the start of the Coors Light Invitational.  </P> <P> In round-robin play, the Lions open against host Colorado (3-6) today. On  Saturday, they face Florida State (7-2) and 20th-ranked Wyoming (6-2).  </P> <P> On the horizon, the Lions return to Gersten Pavilion to play second-ranked UCLA  on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Loyola was buoyed last week by the return to form of all-conference hitter  Kerry House and the return to the lineup of Dana Bragado.  </P> <P> House, on the mend from an injury, had 31 kills and 16 digs in a five-game  victory over UC Irvine and 17 kills and 14 digs in a four-game loss to Long  Beach State, the nation's ninth-rated team.  </P> <P> House's performance boosted her into the West Coast Conference lead in digs  average at 3.97. She also improved to fourth in kill average at 4.16.  </P> <P> In third place, just ahead of House in kills, is Loyola freshman Deanna  Doolittle at 4.25. She leads the Lions with 12 service aces and is second in  digs. Setter Anita Irwin leads the Lions with an assist average of 10.3, good  for third in the WCC.  </P> <P> Loyola's improved volleyball play is indicative of an upward trend in the West  Coast Conference.  </P> <P> The WCC, which began conference play five years ago, is off to its best start  with a composite record of 46-32 through last weekend, despite playing a  tougher schedule. Pepperdine has broken into the national Top 20 at No. 14, and  all eight conference teams have at least four victories.  </P> <P> Last year, WCC schools won only one-third of their first 61 matches. The year  before, the WCC got off to a 13-35 start -- a 27% winning percentage.  </P> <P> The road wasn't kind last week to the Dominguez Hills women's soccer team,  which went 1-3 against several tough opponents away from home.  </P> <P> The Lady Toros' No. 2 preseason ranking was probably based more on reputation  than performance. They played competitively despite their record last week, but  losses to two Division II opponents may have dealt an early blow to their  chances to return to postseason play.  </P> <P> The Lady Toros, who take a 3-3 record into Saturday's 2 p.m. home game against  U.S. International University, suffered a 3-1 loss at traditional Northern  California power Sonoma State, then were upset, 1-0, the following day at UC  Davis.  </P> <P> They returned to Southern California to play two Division I opponents,  recording a 1-0 victory over UC Irvine, then losing, 2-0, at UC Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> College Notes  </P> <P> The Cal State Dominguez Hills men's soccer team (2-3) plays host to Grand  Canyon College at 3:30 today, then travels to Cal State Northridge for a 6 p.m.  game Sunday. Northridge, a traditional foe, upgraded to Division I this season  and is no longer in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. . . . Dominguez  Hills forward Martin Mira earned his 14th assist last week to tie the school  career record. . . . The Loyola Marymount soccer team plays host to powerful  University of San Francisco at 3 p.m. Monday.  </P></p>

The  province's gross domestic product [GDP] totaled 68.6 billion  yuan, an increase of 15.8 percent over the previous year if  calculated by comparable prices. As far as this is concerned,  primary industry increased by 4.5 percent, secondary industry  increased by 31.2 percent, and tertiary industry increased by  12.5 percent. The province's per- capita GDP is expected to  reach 1,742 yuan, a net increase of 307 yuan over the previous  year. This growth was the highest annual growth since the  introduction of reform and opening up. The province's  comprehensive economic strength has obviously increased.    The province's economic development trend over the past year  bears the following characteristics:    1. The rural economy has been flourishing, and the basis of  agriculture has been further intensified. Agricultural  production increased comprehensively, and the optimization  process of the agricultural structure continues. The total  grain output overdid the target set in the beginning of the year  despite a decrease in growing area and serious natural  disasters. The output of industrial crops increased by a wide  margin, with the outputs of cotton, oil-bearing crops, silkworm  cocoons, tea, and flue-cured tobacco all hitting all time highs.  Non-agricultural production sectors developed rapidly in rural  areas, with township and town enterprises enjoying a 92.2  percent growth in their gross output value and emerging as the  greatest growing sector of the economy in the province.    2. Industrial production grew rapidly, and both industrial  production and its economic efficiency improved remarkably. The  industrial growth pattern has gradually changed from the  investment- pulled mode into the investment- and  consumption-pulled mode. Light and heavy industries were  tending to develop side by side in a more harmonious manner,  collective-run and foreign-funded industrial enterprises kept  booming, while large and medium-sized industrial enterprises  played the role as an economic mainstay, and state-owned  industrial enterprises enjoyed steady growth.    3. The province's performance has been prominent in project  construction, with the construction of infrastructure further  intensified. While a moderate investment scale was maintained,  the investment structure has been further optimized. The  remarkable increase in investment was mostly translated into an  tremendous increase in investment in infrastructure. Smooth  progress was made in key construction projects. Both the 10 key  infrastructure projects and 18 key equipment updating and  technological transformation projects which were to be completed  by the end of the year as planned in the beginning of the year  were all completed as scheduled.    4. The income of urban and rural residents continued to  increase. The peasants' per-capita net annual income is expected  to reach 870 yuan or more, an increase of 13.3 percent over the  previous year. With the inflation factor taken into account, the  actual increase will be 4.6 percent, the widest annual increase  margin since the introduction of reform and opening up in the  province. The staff and workers' average wage income was 2,500  yuan, an increase of 16.1 percent. The urban residents'  per-capita income to be spent as living expenditure increased by  26.8 percent, or about 10 percent if with the inflation factor  taken into account, the highest growth per year since reform and  opening up.    5. The market was brisk and prosperous. The province's total  volume of retail sales increased by 21.2 percent over the  previous year, or actually about 10 percent if with the  inflation factor is taken into account. The growth trend of the  retail market showed a pattern of increasingly sharp increase,  with the whole year's increase margin recorded at 3.4 percentage  point above that for the first half of the year. The margin of  price increase on the capital goods market was being narrowed,  while the shortage in supply was being eased, and the end of the  year saw ample supply.    6. The banking situation was stable, with the increase in  the  balance of deposits always higher than the increase in the  balance of loans, and the financial revenue increasing pretty  rapidly. The province's financial revenue totaled 6.56 billion  yuan, an increase of 1.54 billion yuan or 30.8 percent over the  previous year, the highest annual growth ever achieved by the  province. The province's financial revenue overdid its  financial expenditure in the year.    7. The reform was being intensified and the extent of  opening  up to the outside world was constantly being increased in the  year. The foreign investment funds utilized in the year  increased by 72 percent over the previous year.    The above information shows that in 1993 the province's  economy developed in a wholesome manner and along a good trend.    The province did come across some difficulties and problems  in the process of economic development. First, flood and  waterlogging caused great losses; second, the margin of price  increase was too wide for a while; third, bottlenecks that  restrain economic growth have not been eased; and fourth, some  enterprises are still facing great difficulties in business  operation.</p>

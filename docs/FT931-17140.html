			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Vulnerable punt faces a rough start to year: Abolition of exchange controls raises risk THE first currency to come under attack after a quiet Christmas could be the Irish punt, as foreign exchange dealers brace themselves for a new year of speculation against the weaker currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism. Trading on the foreign exchanges was so thin last week that most exchange rates were motionless. But the Bundesbank's unwillingness to ease monetary policy and uncertainty about the future of the ERM left the Irish currency looking beleaguered. On New Year's Eve, the punt was trading at DM2.6315 against the D-Mark, close to its ERM floor of DM2.6190. In the last few days the punt has been alternating with the system's other weak currency - the French franc - at the bottom of the ERM grid. The punt's vulnerability has been heightened by new dangers. Yesterday, the Irish authorities carried out their pledge to abolish the country's remaining exchange controls, in line with the EC's single market programme. It was, in the words of one Irish currency dealer, 'an extraordinarily brave decision'. Until this weekend the controls had meant that foreign investors who wanted to trade in the punt had to deal in the less liquid Euromarket. Now non-residents can borrow punts in Ireland's domestic market, thereby enhancing their ability to speculate in the currency. The arrival of the new year also brings clean balance sheets to many bank dealers. As the end of 1992 approached, dealers were reluctant to take big positions in the market for fear of losing the gains made in the summer currency crisis and spoiling what, in many cases, were excellent end-of-year results. But some analysts believe the currency market is on the verge of renewed speculation. Like the French franc, the punt ought not to be a candidate for devaluation against the D-Mark. Ireland's inflation rate for 1992 is about 2.7 per cent, well below Germany's. The country's current account balance is also in surplus. This is all but ignored by dealers. The punt is under pressure because of investor confidence in the D-Mark as a currency which has never been devalued and which offers a high return, with short-term interest of about 8.75 per cent. Analysts also believe the punt will have to be devalued by about 7 per cent to make up for the competitive devaluation of sterling earlier in the year. Britain remains Ireland's biggest trading partner, accounting for 33 per cent of the Irish export market, and last year's 10 per cent revaluation of the punt against sterling has made life difficult for Ireland's exporters. Mr Steve Barrow, an economist at Chemical Bank in London, believes pressure on the Irish currency is now so great that the EC's monetary committee may be forced to consider a devaluation of the currency as early as this weekend. However, Mr Nick Hunt, head of foreign exchange trading at the Bank of Ireland in Dublin, says that speculation against the currency will not be easy, with Ireland's money market remaining illiquid due to large-scale selling of the punt to the central bank in recent months. Speculators make a profit on a devaluation by borrowing the currency, selling it at the prevailing exchange rate and buying it back when it is at the lower rate. Mr Hunt says that most dealers will be forced to borrow money from the central bank as the interbank market is so illiquid. 'The central bank has already made clear that it will lend at increasingly high rates if it sees sustained pressure on the currency.' With the overnight support rate at about 14 per cent, the central bank can ill afford to raise the price at which it is lending money to the domestic market, for fear of squeezing the country's economy. But there may be limits to the price investors will pay to borrow a currency in the hope that it will be devalued. Company calculations, Page 4</p>

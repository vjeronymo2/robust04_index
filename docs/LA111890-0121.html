			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN-BASHING  </P> <P> Seeing that Richard Reeves (!) was reviewing Ronald Reagan's "An American  Life," I knew he'd insert his own personal hatred for Reagan. And I wasn't  wrong.  </P> <P> In a most biased, bigoted review, he pictures Reagan as an ambitious,  aggressive politician who "joyfully threw the poor into the streets" (!) and  enriched the rich. This is utter rubbish, and libelous to boot.  </P> <P> Reagan was propelled into politics by other forces, and is far from being a  callous brute. He worked his way up from poverty, which I bet Reeves never did.  This review is like asking that other liberal, Ted Kennedy, to review the life  of William F. Buckley Jr.  </P> <P> Reeves is now writing the biography of J.F.K. Wanna bet he writes glowingly  about this shallow, inept, adulterous President?  </P> <P> SIDNEY REED  </P> <P> HAWTHORNE  </P></p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Investors place resources in emerging markets INTERNATIONAL investors have continued to put extra resources into following emerging markets over the past year, although the flow of investment into these markets has slowed markedly, according to a recent survey, In its fourth annual survey of 30 leading international investors, Kleiman International Consultants, based in Washington, found that allocation to developing markets rose by 0.5 percentage points to 10 per cent in 1992, after a 2 percentage point rise the previous year. In the past four years, portfolio allocation has quadrupled. The survey's respondents noted that over the past 12 months an increasing number of conservative pension and Erisa funds have committed a small percentage of funds to emerging markets, generally not more than 2 to 5 per cent of their total international allocation. At more than half the institutions, the emerging markets department was now an 'accepted part' of institutional culture. Investors are still concerned by the regulatory environment and settlement difficulties in some markets. Mexico was voted as the best supervised and most transparent of the emerging markets. Turkey, Brazil, Venezuela, India and Pakistan were cited as continuing problem areas. Brazil and Venezuela were also viewed as the most difficult markets for settlement.</p>

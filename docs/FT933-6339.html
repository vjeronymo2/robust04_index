			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Fyodorov sacking demanded: Piqued Russian parliament overturns Yeltsin's budget veto THE RUSSIAN parliament yesterday called for the head of President Boris Yeltsin's radical finance minister, Mr Boris Fyodorov, and overturned the Russian leader's veto of its inflationary budget. A resolution demanding the removal of one of the main architects of Mr Yeltsin's economic reforms was passed in a fit of parliamentary pique after Mr Fyodorov failed to reappear in parliament after the deputies' lunch-break. 'We need to remove Fyodorov and appoint instead a person who really cares about Russia's national interests,' said Mr Veniamin Sokolov, the conservative parliamentary leader who tabled the non-binding resolution for his removal. Earlier, Mr Fyodorov had asked them to drop their alternative budget, which would double, with 'catastrophic consequences', the deficit planned by the government to more than 20 per cent of gross domestic product. 'History and the people will not forgive us if such a budget is approved,' he had told deputies, warning that their free-spending recipes had already failed in neighbouring Ukraine. Mr Yeltsin has already said he will instruct the government to ignore parliament's budget plans. 'Everything will depend on a political decision by the president - whether we follow what they have planned here,' Mr Fyodorov said as he left parliament. Although Mr Yeltsin managed to trick deputies into altering the title of the budget law, lawyers in parliament said it was uncertain that this would give him a constitutional right to veto it a second time as a different piece of legislation. Meanwhile, Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister responsible for foreign economic relations, said Russia was unlikely to meet its October 1 deadline for agreeing a standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund. This in turn could complicate the continuation of a debt rescheduling agreement, which stipulated that such an agreement should be reached without specifying what would happen if it was not. However, the parliament and president enjoyed a rare meeting of minds after he endorsed parliamentary amendments outlawing 'foreign missionary activity' in Russia. The law means that foreign evangelists such as Billy Graham and various religious sects will be unable to advertise, or publicly seek converts, after complaints from the Russian Orthodox Church and others that the population is too vulnerable to material inducements for joining such organisations.</p>

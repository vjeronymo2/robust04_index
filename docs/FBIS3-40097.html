Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation statistics show border trade amounting to only $13  million during the beginning of reform and opening up to the  outside world in 1980, $4 million of which was imports, and $9  million of which was exports. By 1992, however, China's border  trade figure reached $1.865 billion, including $787 million  worth of imports and $1.078 billion worth of exports. Within the  short space of 12 years, border trade has shot up 142 fold.  Today, China has 216 border trade points open to the outside  world, and 292 markets for trading among border peoples. With  the steady rise in the amount of border trade, China's economic  and technical cooperation, project contracting, labor  cooperation, and investment with nations on its borders,  including the Commonwealth of Independent States countries,  Vietnam, North Korea, Mongolia, Burma, Laos, and Pakistan have  developed across the board. This increasingly lively border  trade, and external economic exchanges, have given extremely  great impetus to the economic development of China's border  regions. It has expanded border region commodity production and  commodity exchange, thereby raising the standard of living of  all border region nationalities. In addition, China's trade with  border countries has produced mutual benefit for certain areas,  the flow of key production elements affecting a rational  allocation of resources. This has not only widened the realm of  China's external economic relations and trade cooperation, and  opened diversified markets, but it has also actively promoted  the development of the countries concerned and the regional  economies of South Asia, Northeast Asia, and Central Asia.    Despite the rapid development of border trade, we must not  overlook problems still remaining in China's border trade that  are in urgent need of solution through macroeconomic regulation  and control measures.  <H3>  I. Major Problems Today in China's Development of Border  Trade </H3>   A. "Appendage" businesses make for disarray in the operating  order, which is detrimental to normal development of border  trade. In recent years, China's border trade has developed very  rapidly, border trade administration and management system  developing from scratch, and exhibiting different  characteristics at each stage of development. Survey data show a  lack of uniformity in both the way that each of the border  provinces and regions conduct border trade and in the border  trade administration and management system. Several of the  provinces and regions that began border trade ahead of the  others adopted what is essentially a deregulated operating  system. They used "appendage" business methods to encourage  diverse economic components, various economic entities, and  provincial and autonomous region trade channels to join in the  border trade. For example, nine corporations in Suifenhe, Heihe  and Harbin in Heilongjiang Province enjoy the right to conduct  border trade, and more than 5,000 companies that are appendages  to these nine corporations also engage in the border trade. They  include not only state-owned import-export companies, but also  collectively owned, privately owned, and individually owned  industrial and commercial companies. This produces a situation  in which anybody and everybody is involved in border trade. This  was all right during the early period of implementation of the  strategy of opening up the border to the outside world to  encourage border area economies to make a major effort in border  trade. Today, however, when China is in process of  transformation of a commodity economy system, and when the legal  system is not yet completely developed, this kind of "appendage"  form of border trade administration and management is not in  keeping with the objective climate for full-speed development of  border trade. It also runs counter to the building of a  socialist market economic enterprise system in which enterprises  are responsible for their own operating decisions and for their  own profits and losses. The consequences it occasions are: 1)  Some "appendage" companies use border trade corporations' right  to engage in border trade to conclude deals with little regard  for good faith. This causes problems. Eventually the border  trade corporation receives the blame. This seriously disturbs  the border trade operating order. 2) As a result of the lack of  effective macroeconomic control, the involvement of numerous  entities in importing and exporting merchandise, cut-throat  competition, and each entity trying to undersell the other, an  extremely serious situation exists in export trade. Some  appendage enterprises or individuals gain benefits at the  expense of enterprises having the right to conduct border trade  and the country. The sale price of Chinese products steadily  declines. For example, one could formerly readily obtain 2 tons  of processed steel for 1 ton of granulated sugar, but only 1 ton  is obtainable today.    B. No macroeconomic regulation and control mechanism has  been  established to guide healthy development of border trade.  Various economic, legal, and administrative regulation and  control measures have not been applied promptly. This impairs  improvement of overall economic returns from border trade.  Border trade is developing very rapidly now, but an overall  macroeconomic regulation and control mechanism for prices,  information services, law, Customs, commercial inspections,  technical supervision, and transportation is still lacking. Some  local governments and departments do as they please, adopt a  laissez-faire attitude, and practice blatant local  protectionism. All these actions hurt the long-term development  of China's border trade and the opening of markets in  neighboring countries. For example, in recent years a  substantial amount of farm machinery, including tractors and  harvesters as well as motor vehicles and engineering machinery,  have been imported from Russia through barter trade. Improper  macroeconomic regulation and control measures, and laxity in  licensing controls and Customs duties collections resulted in  this equipment being dumped in China's domestic markets at lower  than the international market prices. This delivered a serious  blow to Chinese industries producing similar products, some of  which went bankrupt or shifted to other lines of production in  consequence. As another example, in June 1992 Russia revived its  monopoly system for exports of strategic materials, designating  specific foreign trading corporations sole agents for the export  of petroleum, fuels, charcoal, rare metals, steel pipes, and  timber. Russia also expanded quota export commodities,  increasing the quotas for non-ferrous metals and the raw  materials from which they derive. It also hiked the barter trade  export tariff rate 30 percent. On 1 January 1993, it raised it  another 20 percent (i.e., to 50 percent). At the same time, it  revived import duties. However, China did not immediately adopt  corresponding macroeconomic regulation and control measures to  guide development of border trade in a healthy direction of  mutual concessions for mutual benefit.    C. Requisite agencies for the newly opened border entry and  exit points, Customs, and commercial inspection have not been  fully developed; staffing with supervisory and control personnel  is not complete; and control is not strict. Consequently, some  fake, fraudulent, counterfeit, and shoddy merchandise have been  sent outside the country, thereby creating needless losses for  border trade. Survey shows that no commercial inspection  agencies have been set up for more than two-thirds of the  commodities passing through the newly opened border points, and  that 60 percent of the staffing of commercial inspection  agencies has not been completed. A survey of more than 20 border  trade points in Guangxi Province shows, for example, that aside  from Pingxiang, Fangcheng, and Beihai, virtually no commercial  inspection agencies have been set up elsewhere. Consequently,  only 55 percent of the merchandise exported through the border  trading points nationwide are subjected to commercial inspection  agency inspections. In some places, it is only 10 percent. This  amounts to practically no inspection at all, which is an  important reason that fake, fraudulent, counterfeit, and shoddy  merchandise is able to sneak into the country.    D. The incompleteness of laws and regulations governing  local  border trade, and the lack of judicial coordination with  neighboring countries are detrimental to prompt resolution of  border trade disputes. The "Commercial Inspection Code," the  "Regulations for Implementation of the Commercial Inspection  Code," and the "Customs Code," that China has promulgated lack  specific regulations for border trade, Customs, and commercial  inspection agencies supervision, control, and inspection  activities. They do not meet the needs of the new situation of  opening of the borders during the 1990s. Second, no regulations  exist for commercial inspection and customs supervision and  control of things carried by individuals such as travelers and  "profiteers." Loopholes exist in the application of laws.  Furthermore, no bilateral judicial coordination exists between  China and Russia, China and Vietnam, or China and Burma. This is  also an important reason for the inability to resolve promptly  cases involving the flow across the border of false, fraudulent,  counterfeit, and shoddy merchandise, and trade disputes that  occur.    E. The other parties do not honor agreements very well, and  foot dragging is a serious problem. Most contracts cannot be  enforced; thus, China maintains a large trade surplus, which is  detrimental to development of the border trade and to economic  and technical cooperation.

But he explained the matter in a different way. He said  Pakistan had attained complete nuclear ability including the  development of delivery system of the bomb to its target  alongwith the ability for manufacturing the required number of  devices at the time of need.    Addressing a gathering of lawyers and journalists at a local  hotel arranged by Manzoor Qadir Advocate, he said on the  occasion of taking the decision for halting the nuclear  programme, Pakistan had full knowledge of India's nuclear  ability as well as the number of devices it had. He said at  that time Pakistan was in a position to respond to India on  atomic front.    He said the capping of nuclear programme meant that the  manufacturing of the devices should be halted. But the  development of nuclear technology and the delivery system should  be continued.    Replying to a question, he said be had no knowledge that  Benazir Bhutto had provided any help to Rajiv Gandhi during his  tenure as COAS. Answering another question, he rejected the  perception that Pakistan Army was involved in making and  breaking the governments in the country.    He said the Opposition and ruling party politicians had been  trying always to drag the Army into the polities for cover-up to  their misdeeds. He pointed out that only General Ayub Khan,  Yahya Khan and General Zia had willingly interfered in politics.  He said now the thinking of the Army had changed and the Armed  Forces would never seize power in future.    He said if the politicians strengthened the democratic  process in the country the little interference of Army into the  political affairs would also come to an end.    He said be would soon decide to take part in politics. He  said either he would float his own party or would join some  political party of the country. However, he said he would make  this announcement from Lahore. He said he would create a  leadership from grass-roots level as the problems of 95 per cent  of the poor and middle class could not be addressed by the  privileged class in power.    He said the return of the representatives of the poor and  middle class in the assemblies was necessary to resolve the  acute problems of the country.    He said he wanted to see the people in power and that was  why  he had refused to take over the country in August 1988. He said  if the present confrontation continued the people would soon get  fed up with the politicians. He said the politicians lack  vision necessary to run the government.</p>

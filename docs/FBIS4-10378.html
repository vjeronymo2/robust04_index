			<p>BFN     [Text] During General Martin Balza's official three-day  visit, the Colombian and Argentine Armies reached educational  exchange agreements in the military sector.    Balza and General Hernan Jose Guzman, Colombian Army  commander, set dates for visits to Colombia and Argentina by  high-ranking staff officers of both armies and established a  student exchange program for advanced military courses.    Thus, in principle, two Argentine officers will arrive soon  in Colombia to take lancers courses and other military  disciplines, while two Colombian officers will travel to  Argentina for an advanced military intelligence course and other  advanced studies.    In addition, the Colombian Army commander is scheduled to  officially visit the Argentine Army headquarters in late June.    Balza praised the good relations between the two forces,  saying: "We must try to achieve greater cooperation through  mutually beneficial agreements. We do not have to gain each  other's confidence, because we already have it."</p>

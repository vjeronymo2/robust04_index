			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAI CUTS CASH, ADDS SECURITIES TO BID FOR PRIME  </P> <P> Six months into its hostile takeover bid for Prime Computer, MAI Basic Four  Inc. on Thursday lowered its $1.3-billion bid for the company by offering 25%  less cash and adding securities.  </P> <P> The new package carries a total cash value of $965.7 million and includes the  disclosure of the names of four investment firms providing MAI's financing,  something the Tustin-based computer firm seems to have had difficulty securing.  </P> <P> On May 15, Prime's chairman, David J. Dunn, challenged MAI in a public letter  to get its financing in order for the proposed $20-a-share offer by today. If  it did, he said, Prime would not invoke anti-takeover measures.  </P> <P> "We were asked where the financing was, and now we're saying here it is," said  William B. Patton, MAI's president.  </P> <P> Patton attributed the revised offer to Prime's recent projections of lower  revenue, plus new and costly Prime employee benefit and pension plans. MAI  originally offered to pay $20 a share in cash for all of Prime's common stock  and also for certain options and debt securities that could be converted into  stock.  </P> <P> MAI is now offering $19.50 a share in cash only for the 49.5 million shares of  Prime common stock outstanding. If holders of options and debt securities  exercise their conversion rights, increasing the number of shares outstanding,  the amount of cash paid per share would decline to as little as $14.65 a share.  </P> <P> Any difference between the final cash price and the stated offer of $19.50 a  share would be made up with new MAI bonds.  </P> <P> Executives at Prime would not comment on the new offer until after they meet to  discuss it. However, Prime spokesman Joe Gavaghan termed the bonds "of  questionable value."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Offer Expires June 14  </P> <P> The new offer expires June 14, the date of Prime's annual meeting, where a  proxy fight is expected over MAI's proposed slate of directors. The companies  financing the bid and the amounts they are committing are: Drexel Burnham  Lambert Group Inc., $550 million; Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, $400  million; Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., $300 million, and Brooke Partners, $150  million. The excess cash raised would be used to refinance existing debt at  both companies.  </P> <P> Some industry analysts were also not enthused about the lower bid.  </P> <P> "It's a borderline fair price, but I don't think it's a good price," said  Charles Foundyller, president of Daratech Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., marketing  research firm.  </P> <P> Prime's stock closed Thursday at $16.625 a share, up 25 cents from Wednesday's  close. Only a month ago, when MAI's offer of $20 a share was pending, Prime's  stock was trading at $19.50 a share. On Feb. 2, it had hit $21 a share.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'In the Best Interests'  </P> <P> Barry J. Tarasoff, an industry analyst with Wertheim Schroder brokerage in New  York, said he thinks "it's in the best interests of Prime shareholders to  accept the deal."  </P> <P> "When Prime threw down the gauntlet a few weeks ago, that was a signal to MAI  that Prime didn't have a higher bid," he said. MAI could afford to lower the  bid without worrying about serious competition, he said.  </P> <P> By late Wednesday, about 67.5% of Prime's stock had been tendered to MAI, which  already owns about 2.4% of the company. Patton said those shareholders who  tendered shares will be notified of the new offer and will have the right to  withdraw. He predicted, however, that MAI will end up with even more tenders.  </P> <P> But Thursday's reduced offer could affect the credibility of MAI's chairman,  Bennett S. LeBow, a New York financier who has spearheaded the takeover  attempt.  </P> <P> "You tender your shares and you kind of expect the guy to keep the deal,"  Foundyller said. "The lower price might lower stockholder opinion of LeBow.  They may think that once he takes control, he may change the rules again."  </P> <P> </P> <P> MAI'S 7-MONTH BATTLE TO ACQUIRE PRIME  </P> <P> November, 1988: MAI Basic Four Inc., a Tustin-based computer manufacturing and  service company, launches a hostile takeover bid for Prime Computer Inc. MAI  offers $20 a share for Prime, a much larger minicomputer maker with  headquarters in Natick, Mass. Prime, declaring the offer too low, strongly  resists the takeover attempt.  </P> <P> December: U.S. District Judge A. David Mazzone in Boston issues an injunction  barring the MAI bid until the company can provide additional details about its  financing of the offer. In turn, MAI objects to Prime's poison-pill  anti-takeover plans in Chancery Court in Delaware.  </P> <P> March, 1989: MAI begins a proxy fight to replace Prime's board of directors.  </P> <P> May: Judge Mazzone lifts the injunction blocking MAI's offer. The same day,  Prime Chairman David J. Dunn challenges MAI by declaring he will sell the  company if MAI can come up with the $1.3 billion by June 2.  </P> <P> June: MAI reduces its offer for Prime Computer by 50 cents, to $19.50 per  share. The reason, according to MAI Chairman Bennett S. LeBow, is Prime's lower  earnings.  </P></p>

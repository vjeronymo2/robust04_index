Comrade Le Duc Anh, member of the Political Bureau and  president of the state, attended the conference and expressed  his views to the participants. On behalf of the central public  security service party committee, Comrade Bui Thien Ngo  delivered a report pointing out past achievements. He  emphatically said: To satisfactorily fulfill its new tasks, the  public security force must make sustained efforts to serve the  goals of national defense and construction as well as of  socioeconomic development. It is essential to firmly ensure  political stability and internal security, thereby foiling the  enemy's peaceful evolution scheme.    In the days ahead, the central public security service party  organization must continue to revamp its structures and improve  the quality of its unit-building work.    Speaking on this occasion, Comrade Le Duc Anh commended the  public security force for its achievements in carrying out the  party-initiated renovation undertaking. He emphatically said:  To outstandingly fulfill its new tasks, the public security  force must work out measures to guarantee internal unity and  promote solidarity with other sectors, particularly the Army.  Efforts must be made to improve everyone's knowledge and  modernize equipment. Adequate measures must be taken to turn  the public security force into a modern and regular Army-type  organization. Steps must be taken to look after the well-being  of cadres and combatants. Prompt measures must be taken to  overcome all indications of negativism. It is necessary to make  every effort to guarantee the purity of the public security  force.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> E. Test Frequency and Convenience <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must include a detailed test schedule, including the test year selection scheme if testing is other than annual. The SIP must also include the legal authority necessary to implement and enforce the test frequency requirement and explain how the test frequency will be integrated with the enforcement process. In addition, in enhanced I/M programs, the SIP needs to demonstrate that the network of stations providing testing services is sufficient to ensure consumer convenience by providing short waiting times to get a test, and short driving distances to get to the test center. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Maine SIP revision requires biennial inspections for all subject motor vehicles that are at least two years old. The inspections will be conducted on odd or even years corresponding to the model year of the vehicle and timed with the registration process. This is described in more detail in the July 21, 1994 submittal. The authority for enforcing the testing frequency is contained in the revised Maine I/M rule. Short waiting times and short driving distances relating to network design are addressed in the contract between the State and its contractor, and in the Maine rules. The contract requires an average waiting time of 15 minutes or less per test (except for 7 days per month) and inspection facility locations which ensure that 85% of the vehicle population is within a fifteen mile drive of each facility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> F. Vehicle Coverage <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must include a detailed description of the number and types of vehicles to be covered by the program, and a plan for identifying subject vehicles, including vehicles that are routinely operated in the area but may not be registered in the area. Also, the SIP must include a description of any special exemptions which will be granted by the program, and an estimate of the percentage and number of vehicles granted such exemptions. Such exemptions need to be accounted for in the emission reduction analysis. In addition, the SIP needs to include the legal authority necessary to implement and enforce the vehicle coverage requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maine's I/M program covers all 1968 and newer model year gasoline powered light-duty vehicles and light-duty and heavy-duty trucks, registered, or required to be registered, within the nonattainment areas (only the testing of 1981 and newer vehicles is considered in evaluating whether the enhanced performance standard is met). Vehicles will be identified through the State Department of Transportation vehicle registration database. Special classes, which are exempt from the emission testing program, include vehicles weighing more than 10,000 pounds (GVWR), street rods, stock race cars, and motorcycles. Based on information provided by the State, Maine has shown that such exemptions will not prevent the program from achieving the performance standard. Additional detail supporting this conclusion was submitted by the State on July 21, 1994. Legal authority for the vehicle coverage requirement is contained in the Maine I/M rule and the July, 1993 authorizing legislation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised rules submitted by Maine on July 21, 1994 include a low-mileage waiver (LMW) which exempts vehicles driven less than 5000 miles per year. The authorizing legislation requires the LMW and also requires that the DEP prepare a report on its effect on Maine's ability to meet the performance standard. The May 26, 1994 letter and the July 21, 1994 submittal from the DEP commit to provide the legislature with this information by January 31, 1995, and to secure revised legislation if the data shows that Maine cannot achieve the performance standard required by EPA's I/M rule. If necessary, the DEP also commits to revising its regulation by June 1, 1995, to hold a public hearing on necessary regulatory changes, and to submit to EPA a revised SIP submittal removing the LMW by September 1, 1995. At present, there is inadequate information for EPA to determine how this waiver will affect the performance standard. For this reason, EPA is conditionally approving the submission based on the above-referenced commitments by DEP. Failure to meet any of these dates will result in EPA disapproval of this action, unless the EPA Regional Administrator approves a later date in writing no later than the date of the applicable milestone. Under no circumstances will the September 1, 1995 date for final submittal be revised.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

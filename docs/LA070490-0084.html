			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COCHELL LEAVES FULLERTON TO TAKE OKLAHOMA JOB;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASEBALL: TITAN COACH CITES FAMILY CONSIDERATIONS IN MOVING.  </P> <P> The lure of Oklahoma proved too strong for Larry Cochell, who resigned as Cal  State Fullerton's baseball coach Tuesday and took the coaching job at the  University of Oklahoma.  </P> <P> Cochell, 49, who guided the Titans to two College World Series appearances in  three seasons, was at Oral Roberts University in Tulsa from 1977-86.  </P> <P> "Everyone knows I left a good job, but it was as much a family decision as it  was a career decision," Cochell said at a news conference in Norman, Okla.  "When my boys (sons Craig, 18, and Chad, 14) talked about home, they always  meant Oklahoma. I like the people here."  </P> <P> Cochell replaces Stan Meek, who coached on an interim basis last season after  the retirement of Enos Semore.  </P> <P> Terms of Cochell's contract were not disclosed. At Fullerton, Cochell's base  salary of $63,000 was supplemented by income from summer baseball camps and a  shoe contract.  </P> <P> "We couldn't match what they were offering," said Steve DiTolla, Fullerton  associate athletic director who oversees baseball. "Larry indicated that it was  too good an offer to turn down.  </P> <P> "He had nothing but good things to say about our program, and I don't think  there was anything that drove him out of here. But I would assume Oklahoma has  more resources to work with than we have here."  </P> <P> DiTolla said the Fullerton job "is wide open at this point." The school will  form a selection committee and will conduct a national search for a successor,  DiTolla said. Could that someone be Augie Garrido, who built the Titans into a  national power and won two College World Series championships before taking the  Illinois job in 1987? Garrido's three-year contract with Illinois expires in  August, and he has not negotiated a new contract.  </P> <P> DiTolla wouldn't speculate but Garrido, who is in Austin, Tex., as a coach with  Team U.S.A., didn't rule out the possibility.  </P> <P> "I don't see myself as a candidate, but if Fullerton does, I'm sure they'll get  in touch with me," Garrido said. "And if they get in touch, we'll talk."  </P> <P> Fred Hoover, who coached at Golden West College for 22 years before becoming a  Titan assistant in 1989, said he was interested, as did George Horton, the  Cerritos College coach who was a finalist for the Fullerton job in 1987.  </P> <P> Horton, who has led Cerritos to three state community college championships in  the last five years, withdrew from the running in 1987 because of the job's  fund-raising requirements.  </P> <P> Other likely local candidates are Loyola Marymount Coach Chris Smith, who was  an assistant at Fullerton in 1983 and '84; Cal State Northridge Coach Bill  Kernan, a former Titan and Illinois assistant who took Northridge to the  Division II national championship game last season; and Rancho Santiago College  Coach Don Sneddon.  </P> <P> Cochell, who has a 791-450-2 record in 24 years of coaching, went 109-68 in his  three seasons at Fullerton. The Titans finished third in the College World  Series in 1988 and lost their first two games in the 1990 series.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Akira Sano, Manager, Fuel Cell Development </F> Department, Technical Development, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy  Industries Co., Ltd.]    [Text]  <H5>  Foreword </H5>   Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (IHI) has  developed the molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) under the NEDO  (New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization)  Program as part of the New Sunshine Project of MITI since 1987.    Recent significant results of MCFC development are two 50kW  class stacks and a 100kW class stack, which is the target of the  former phase of the MCFC Program.    The 100kW stack is now under power generation test at the  Akagi Stack and System Square.    Following the development of 100kW stack, a 1MW MCFC pilot  plant is planned for construction from 1994, under the Program.  <H5>  1. Large Capacity Stack </H5>   IHI has been developing an internally manifolded co-flow  type  stack, in which the fuel gas and oxidant gas flow in the same  direction. One of the advantages of this co-flow type is easy to  enlarge the cell area in the orthogonal direction of the gas  flow without changing the reaction pattern. With this principal,  IHI has developed a rectangular cell with 1m&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  active  area, 560mm length by 1,800mm width, which is called ``tatami  type'' owing to its shape. The green tape of the electrode and  electrolyte is cast by the doctor blade method, and the  electrode is sintered in the electric furnace. The separator is  fabricated with stainless steel thin sheets by automatic welding  machine. For assembling of the stack, a mechanical handling  device has been developed in order to make the accurate stacking  speedy.    Figure 1 shows the history of the stack development at IHI.  The recent results of the stack development are presented as  follows.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-001LC-23A>           Figure 1. Development Program of MCFC Stack </FIG>     <H5>  2. 50kW Stack Test </H5>   Prior to the development of the 100kW stack, two 50kW stacks  were developed.    The first 50kW stack had the purpose of establishing the  tall  stacking technology for 50 cells with 1m&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  and  verifying over 50kW power generation (Figure 2 [figure not  reproduced]). This stacks power generation test was carried out  in spring of 1992, and successfully generated for more than  2,500 hours with good performance.    Maximum power output was 55kW with conditioning of  70&percnt; fuel  utilization and 150 mA/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  current density.    The second 50kW stack was developed to estimate the stack  performance with an intermediate holder and to discuss the stack  transportation because of the necessity to transport from the  IHI site to the Akagi Square for the 100kW stack.    This 50kW stack consists of 25 cells on both upper and lower  sides of the intermediate holder, respectively (Figure 3 [figure  not reproduced]). The stack successfully generated 55.7kW at 150  mA/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  current density and 84&percnt; fuel utilization.  Difference of average cell voltage between upper and lower part  of the stack was very small. After the initial power generation  test, the stack was cooled down and transported around the IHI  factory, and then the power generation test was carried out  again to confirm no changes in its performance.  <H5>  3. 100kW Stack Test </H5>   100kW stack consists of two blocks of 51 cells with  1m&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  active area on both upper and lower sides of an  intermediate holder, respectively (Figure 4 [figure not  reproduced]). This stack was assembled in May of this year  (Figure 5 [figure not reproduced]), and the initial power  generation test was carried out in the 50kW test facility. The  power output was 62kW at 70 mA/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  and 44&percnt; fuel  utilization. After the initial power generation test, it was  cooled down and transported to the Akagi Square and is being  tested at this time.  <H5>  Acknowledgments </H5>   IHI intends to pour its energies into the early  commercialization of MCFC plants. IHI appreciates the support  and assistance of related groups, especially those of the AIST,  NEDO, the MCFC Research Association and utility companies.</p>

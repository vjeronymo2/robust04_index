The force is to have political and logistics support from  member nations of the commission. This is contained in a  communique issued at the end of the eighth summit of the Lake  Chad Basin Commission this morning in the Nigerian capital,  Abuja. The establishment of the joint security force was agreed  upon by the summit because of its belief that programs on the  master plan of the commission can only be achieved in a secure  environment.    The commission therefore decided on a rotational leadership  for the joint security force with defined mode of human and  material contribution by member states. The headquarters of the  force will be at Bagakawa, in Borno State of Nigeria.    The summit also adopted a master plan designed to halt  ecological degradation of the lake and its basin. The Nigerian  head of state, General Sani Abacha, described steps taken by the  commission in this respect as a significant milestone in the  search for a lasting solution to a major environmental crisis.  He said the master plan contained viable and sustainable  strategies for the management and development of the natural  resources of the Lake Chad Basin. Gen. Abacha also explained  that the water resources of the lake had reduced from 25,000  square km in the 1960's to 20,000 square km at present.    The summit admitted the Central African Republic as the  fifth  member of the commission. The inclusion of that country was in  respect of its strategic location as the source of major rivers  which are flowing to the Lake Chad.    The next summit of the commission is to be held in Chad next  year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Today, the cabinet approved the  agreement between the Federal Government and Lufthansa on  pensions for Lufthansa employees in Bonn today. The cabinet has  thus cleared the way for a complete privatization of Lufthansa,  Federal Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann (Christian  Democratic Union) told the Bundestag. The privatization is a  milestone on the path toward securing the company's  competitiveness.    Agreement on the pension claims came about in early May.  Finance Minister Waigel said he is prepared to provide 1.5  billion marks for Lufthansa employees. As the Federal  Government does not wish to participate in the impending  increase in share capital, its proportion of Lufthansa shares  will fall to under 50 percent. The agreement on a new company  pension arrangement for the 48,000 or so Lufthansa employees was  concluded on 10 May.</p>

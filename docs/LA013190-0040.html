			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BURBANK SCHOOLS STUDY NEW BOUNDARIES  </P> <P> The Burbank Unified School District may change its boundaries so that more  Luther Burbank Junior High School students will attend John Burroughs High  School in the fall, district officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The proposal is designed to balance enrollment at Burbank's two high schools to  keep comparable educational programs at the schools, said Arthur N. Pierce,  district superintendent.  </P> <P> The amount of state funding a school receives is based on its enrollment.  </P> <P> The plan calls for students who live between Victory Boulevard and Empire  Avenue to go to Burroughs, Pierce said. Previously, only students who lived  south of Victory Boulevard went to Burroughs, he said.  </P> <P> About 170 more students are attending Burbank High School. District officials  project that if the boundaries are not changed, that number will increase to  400 by the end of the decade.  </P> <P> The Burbank Board of Education may consider the boundary change as early as  next month, Pierce said. If approved, the plan would be implemented in the  fall, he said.  </P> <P> The plan would give ninth-graders at Luther Burbank Junior High who live in the  affected neighborhood until September to choose between the two high schools.  </P></p>

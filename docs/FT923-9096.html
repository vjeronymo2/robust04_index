			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Arts: My Mathematics - Theatre ROSE ENGLISH brought her new show, My Mathematics, to London's Queen Elizabeth Hall on Wednesday, sadly for one performance only. One reason I would like to see it again almost immediately is to tell how far it is improvised, for surely not even the remarkable Ms English can perform the same tricks every night. You will be inevitably misled by the title. Although there is some fanciful stuff about numbers and moving from zero to nought, Mathematics is the name of a horse. In the second act it is on stage almost throughout. Ms English achieves what Hollywood stars are advised never even to try: she acts with an animal and more or less comes out on top, though even she admits that it is sometimes touch and go. Ms English is a brilliant tease. That is how her act works. She comes across as an educated Gipsy Rose Lee. So first one must pay tribute to the build-up. The first half is a mildly seductive introduction to the second. At the start Ms English tells how she used to be Rosita of the Circus with a huge troupe of animals and a large band. Now she has only an accordionist (discretely played by Ian Hill) at her side. She goes in for some audience participation, pantomime-style. She has the most enormous black artificial eyelashes. The audience is invited to be kissed or lashed, then to cut the lashes. Presumably she is relying on plants scattered round the hall, but there is always the chance that someone unexpected might turn up. This is a high-risk business. Ms English also has a habit of saying 'Yes, yes', sometimes 'Yes, yes, yes' and occasionally even 'Yes' five times. There is the odd variant of 'No, no'. Irritating at first, it becomes endearing. They are, after all, strong words. When this lady says them, she obviously means them, even to horses. Thus the first act is pleasant, with the odd bit of conjuring, but slight. Only the glimpse of Mathematics just before the interval gives a hint of what is in store. Ms English is now in leotard, bare-backed like the horse. Her eyelashes have switched to red. She still has a whip, but seems to need it less with the horse than with the accordionist. She rides, cajoles and practically makes love to the beast. At one stage on Wednesday he seemed in a distinctly and - one would guess - unpredictably randy mood. 'He's been in a lot of Westerns,' Ms English says, as he looks set to gallop off into the sunset. How far this is all pre-planned is impossible to tell from one sitting. Ms English seems to have doubts herself. 'Is it coercion?' she asks as the horse obeys her. 'It's a difficult question, isn't it?' Then the horse suddenly starts pushing her around. According to the programme, the real name of the horse is Goldy, owned and trained by Joan Rosaire, who appears at the final curtain. Ms Rosaire deserves a large share of the credits. It is Ms English, however, who has achieved the ultimate in strip-tease: teasing without stripping.</p>

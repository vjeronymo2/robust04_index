			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LEMOND NOT IN PEAK FORM, BUT HE'S OVERCOME THAT BEFORE  </P> <P> Can Greg LeMond do it again?  </P> <P> Last year, he made a stunning comeback on the final day to win the Tour de  France for the second time.  </P> <P> But outside demands took their toll on LeMond during the winter, and a virus  slowed his attempts to get back into shape.  </P> <P> As the 1990 race begins Saturday in a high-technology theme park called  Futuroscope, LeMond, the only American to win the Tour de France, will be  closely watched.  </P> <P> "I feel good," LeMond said. "Things are coming around just in time. I am not  sure I am going to be turned around 100% for the Tour, but I will be there."  </P> <P> Even a less-than-100% LeMond is dangerous. He has based his whole year on  winning this race again.  </P> <P> His toughest competition could come from three other former champions --  Stephen Roche of Ireland, Pedro Delgado of Spain, and France's Laurent Fignon,  a close second to LeMond last year.  </P> <P> LeMond, after winning in 1986, missed the next two years while recovering from  an accidental shooting and various illnesses and ailments. He went into the  Tour last year as a question mark and came out a winner.  </P> <P> This year's race starts with a prologue of four miles, a virtual sprint around  the high-tech complex dotted with 360-degree movie theaters and video  showrooms.  </P> <P> For the first week, relatively flat stages give the top positions to the  sprinters. Then come the mountains, starting July 9.  </P> <P> Four days will be spent in the high mountains -- two in the Alps and two in the  Pyrenees.  </P> <P> The mountain rides start with a quick detour through Switzerland to Geneva  before returning to France. It is a clockwise journey around France that  stretches more than 2,125 miles.  </P></p>

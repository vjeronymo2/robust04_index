NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA points out in this connection that, with  the exception of Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov, the make-up of  the new government is almost the same as that of the previous  one. "If one bears in mind Gaydar's words that he could not  influence the government's policy of late, as well as the fact  that Fedorov said about the same thing, one may come to the  conclusion that what we are having now is just the old cabinet,  but free from political contradictions and psychological  conflicts," the newspaper writes. "However, it is the old  cabinet that was pursuing the reform policy without much success  and without any system. Consequently, the old- new government,  hastily made up, will pretty soon have either to be really  renewed, or to renew (or rather define) its programme."    Commenting on the resignation of Gaydar and Fedorov, the  newspaper stresses that "all this produces the impression of a  step, calculated beforehand." NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA writes with  reference to Boris Fedorov and Leonid Abalkin, a well-known  economist: "A dramatic growth of inflation in the first quarter  of this year was inevitable, and no government, whatever its  make-up, could prevent it. It is noteworthy in this connection  that both Yegor Gaydar, the 'motive force' of the reform, and  Boris Fedorov, its ideologist, preferred to wash their hands of  it and not to link themselves with the government any longer.  Now that the radical democrats freed themselves of  responsibility for the situation in the Russian economy, it is  obvious that the renewed government will be held responsible for  the overall economic disintegration."    Commenting on the reorganisation of the government,  IZVESTIYA  writes that "the prime minister left the cabinet almost without  the architects and active supporters of the previous policy and,  at the same time, announced that the reform course would remain  unchanged." The newspaper quotes the prime minister as saying  that "we shall fight inflation by non-monetarist methods." "If  the invariability of the policy consists in the transfer from  monetarist to non- monetarist methods of fighting inflation,  then new people will be really needed in the government. The  impression is that we are on the threshold of a major turn  towards old times."    Pointing to the relative stabilisation of the Russian  currency market, IZVESTIYA writes that the hope for the  stabilisation of the exchange rate is based on the dramatic  reduction of the demand for hard currency at the latest auction.  "It stood at 67,100,000 dollars, while since the beginning of  the year it had been almost all the time on the level of 150  million dollars. The inevitable result of the rush with the  purchasing of hard currency was the depletion of the ruble  resources of all participants in currency transactions. It is  not accidental that only 66 banks took part in the latest  auction, while the usual figure is 83-85."    "Personal changes in the government invariably reflect  political changes," KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA writes. Analysing the  political situation in the country, the newspaper comes to the  conclusion that, most probably, we shall witness in the future  "the Ukrainian version of runaway inflation, the curtailment of  production in all industries, the coming to power of a 'tough  guy' and, in the long run, the retreat to previous positions."    "Now there are grounds to believe that the cabinet has  shifted from the right-wing liberal flank to the right-wing  centre," PRAVDA writes. "Will the everyday work of the  government confirm this supposition? If so, is it possible to  say that we are witnessing the beginning of the political drift  of state power towards the left and that it is coming closer to  the real interests of working people?" "A lot of questions might  be asked, but one thing is clear: the monetarist idea has lost  its value."    Touching upon the issues of the reorganisation of the  government, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA points out that "although Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said he had had no special  differences with the president, many observers believe that they  did have a clash over the government make-up, which may trigger  another political crisis in the top echelon. Even today many  people regard Chernomyrdin as a politician, who is claiming an  independent role in the political arena."    TRUD frontpages an article dealing with the investigation  into the crash of the Tu-154m plane belonging to the Baykal Air  Company, that took place near Irkutsk on January 3. "The results  of the work of the government commission will soon be made  public. One thing is clear already: some time ago an utterly  unwise decision was taken on the dissolution of Gosavianadzor, a  unique control body. It actually kept under control the  take-off of every plane. The dissolution of Gosavianadzor made  passenger flights a very dangerous undertaking."    SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA and PRAVDA carry materials dealing with  the 70th anniversary of Lenin's death. "On January 21 numerous  representatives of communist and workers' parties, the young  communist league (Komsomol), war and labour veterans, Muscovites  and guests of the Russian capital came to the Red Square to pay  tribute of respect to Lenin," PRAVDA writes.</p>

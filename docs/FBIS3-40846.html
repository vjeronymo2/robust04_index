			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ram Chandra Rahi: "The Main problem Is Not </F> Cheating, Its the Educational System"]    [Text] It is being said in opposition to the directive on  cheating on examinations that the whole education system would  be ruined by this anti-cheating in examination law. It is being  said in its support that the education of our students will be  greatly enhanced. Is cheating on examinations the main problem  in our educational system? Will this problem be resolved just by  quickly stopping it, or by being soft about it? People who know  about the problems in our education system and those with some  basic understanding of the rules and regulations of our  educational system may never recognize cheating on examinations  as the root cause of our educational problems.    The fact is that since independence, we have been avoiding  looking at the main problem of our educational system. We have  been looking for some superficial resolutions. The main problem  of our educational system is not cheating on examinations; it is  the present educational system itself. It is a dreadful  contradiction in our national life that in our independent  India, the educational system of our slave days is still being  implemented. All the educators who belong to Lord Macaulay's  "family" are following this slave system of education  continuously. They are even trying to strengthen it. This is an  established circle which is sometimes altered on the surface.  However, all the basic problems remain where they are.    The major problem with our educational system is that it is  opposed to our personal, familial, social, and national life. It  does not provide solutions to our problems; it has become a  problem in itself. The students spend 18, 21, 25, and in some  cases, as many as 30 years of the best years of their lives to  earn this education. At the end, they get a certificate written  on a piece of paper, which they hold in their hands as they  wander around looking for employment. After years of wandering,  they are lucky if they become a cog to fit in the present  system. This only increases one more parasite in our society. If  anyone still has good qualities, then despite this education, he  still tries to remain a moral person and to do his job honestly.  In most cases, one tries to take back one's educational  investments with interest from the government and the society.  This is because our present educational system does not teach  morals and religion. This system does not even make them capable  of becoming producers and creators to help build their lives,  society, and the country. This education does not stir a desire  in them to take risks, become an active citizen, break away from  the life-style of slaves, and strive for creating an  independent, democratic, and fair human organization. What will  we gain by making these superficial changes in the examination  system if we keep this educational structure?    When the main goal is to become a capable consumer at any  cost and to earn money, and there is no hesitation in our  society to do anything to achieve this goal, then expecting a  student to be honest on the examinations that help him get the  certificate is analogous to expecting the impossible.    If we look from one perspective, there should be no reason  for a student to fail after working in school for a full year.  If anyone should fail, it should be either the teacher or the  guardians, or both of them. Why cannot we expect a student to  achieve the expected goals after studying for a year? Do not the  guardians or the teachers have any responsibility?    It is an accepted principle in sociology that a government  is  best when it is involved in administration the least. In other  words, there should be a minimum number of law- and  consequence-based rules in social life. The society should run  by its own good deeds. Education is a process of awakening good  morals in a person. When the last step of this educational  process, these so-called examinations, is the punishment, the  law, and the police all in itself, we have to think what goals  can we achieve with this kind of education. What will our  present and future generations learn?    Mulayam Singh Yadav has said that a committee of experts  will  be established to evaluate the present system and decide on a  new educational system. This is a welcome announcement. Mulayam  Singh has at least responded through this announcement to the  accusations levied against him for "destroying the educational  system." However, the basic question is not of the testing  system; it is of the whole educational system. From the  president to an average citizen, everyone believes, and has  announced at one time or another, that the educational system  needs an overhaul. Many commissions were established after  independence, and nationwide discussions were also held. All the  recommendations made by those commissions are still gathering  dust somewhere.    The Kothari Commission had recommended some basic and  preliminary steps. Implementation of these would have opened a  new door for educational reform--for example, the elimination of  the degree requirement for a job. When one finished an  educational program, the administrator would simply write how  long the student had been in the course of study, and at what  level he or she finished. The employer invites a candidate to  test his knowledge and abilities, and to provide employment. The  basis of employment would move from getting the certificates to  one's actual ability. The teacher will also have the pressure to  teach on time and finish a level at a specific time. The Kothari  Commission has recommended a specific school that promised equal  employment opportunities to all citizens under the Constitution.  This recommendation would help remove the economic discrepancy  in the educational system. The Kothari Commission  recommendations, however, are collecting dust in the  government's records room, and our progress is being made in the  area of education that prepares for various jobs, and in selling  50 percent of these positions for money.    Why is it happening that even government-appointed  commissions' recommendations are being put in cold storage?  Public schools (the specialist of these schools is that the  general public cannot get admission to them) are implementing  the recommendations made by the Navoday school. In a country  which claims to follow democracy and equality in society,  education that irrigates the roots of differences in our society  should not be encouraged. Why did not this question become a  subject of the peoples' uprising? Why are the steps to  implementing the anti-cheating law considered to be providing  balance to education and its recall destructive to the whole  education system? This is because we want to avoid getting to  the root of this problem.    A veteran state leader and the education minister, who were  criticizing the present educational system, were once asked by a  Gandhian thinker and hard-working old man, "If everyone from you  to the president are aware of the evils of the present  educational system, then who is running this system?" The  education ministers responded: "No one is running it. It runs by  itself." This incident is about 27 to 28 years old. I would like  to add to this comment: All those who have a vested interest in  the present system are running it. These include bureaucrats,  rich people, and leaders. Perhaps, to an extent, all of us who  are not able to attain our goals, but who hope that they will  have the opportunity to achieve them some day are part of this  problem.</p>

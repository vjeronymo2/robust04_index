			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> D.A. TO SEEK LIFE IN PRISON FOR RUSS IN 1987 KILLING OF HIS ARTIST WIFE  </P> <P> Former fugitive Charles Russ faces a life sentence without the possibility of  parole if he is convicted of killing his artist wife by running over her with  her own car, the San Diego County district attorney's office said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark Pettine said the death penalty had been ruled out.  Pettine said "a total review of the case" resulted in the determination that  life without parole would be "appropriate punishment."  </P> <P> Russ, 39, formerly of Leucadia, entered a not-guilty plea to the murder charge  Tuesday, and San Diego Superior Court Judge Herbert Exarhos set trial for June  13.  </P> <P> Russ' wife, Pamela, 33, was found on North Torrey Pines Road near La Jolla on  Feb. 1, 1987. Her Mercedes-Benz was found nearby.  </P> <P> Russ is also charged with two counts of forgery and two counts of grand theft  in the alleged embezzlement of $78,000, the life savings of his mother-in-law,  Ginger Allen, 68.  </P> <P> Pettine said the special-circumstances allegations stated that Pamela Russ was  killed for financial gain and that she was a witness to the bilking of her  mother.  </P> <P> Exarhos revoked a $3-million bail set for Russ because of the filing of the  special-circumstances allegations.  </P> <P> An attorney substituting for Russ' regular attorney objected, and the judge  scheduled a bail review for Dec. 27. He will be held without bail until then.  </P> <P> Pettine said that Russ was a fugitive for two years, until his arrest in  Florida in August, and was thus a flight risk.  </P> <P> Russ was arrested after the case was featured on "America's Most Wanted"  television show. He was recognized by a North Hollywood, Fla., detective who  was walking on a beach.  </P></p>

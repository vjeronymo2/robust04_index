			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 200 PROTEST PROPOSED COUNTY DUMP NEAR PALA;  </P> <P> PUBLIC MEETING: CITIZENS VOICE CONCERNS OVER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT AND  METHOD OF  </P> <P> William Worrell of the county's solid waste division sat quietly as he was  berated by silver-haired Jeanne Ray on the evils of a proposed landfill site  near Pala.  </P> <P> Ray was one of more than 200 people who packed the Pauma Valley Community  Center to protest the development of the site. They sat in folding chairs,  lined the walls, stood in front of doorways and outside the building.  </P> <P> The crowd at the meeting hall was just one indication to Ray that the county  was not taking the matter seriously.  </P> <P> This was the second of three public meetings held by the Department of Public  Works to discuss future North County landfills.  </P> <P> Residents who attended the meeting voiced concerns over everything from the  process by which the Gregory Canyon site was chosen to the depth of the  environmental impact report to what they perceived as strong-armed politicking,  not to mention the adverse effect expected from putting a 33-million-cubic-yard  dump in the neighborhood.  </P> <P> "There are issues that can't be mitigated," said Worrell, deputy directory of  the solid waste division. "And those issues have to be considered by the  Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors when they make their  decision."  </P> <P> The Gregory Canyon site, 2 1/2 miles from Pala, is one of three proposed by the  county to replace the nearly full San Marcos landfill, which is expected to  reach capacity in five to seven years.  </P> <P> The county's proposed action is to purchase and operate all three sites as  landfills. One of the other sites is near Fallbrook and the other near Warner  Springs.  </P> <P> Together, the three sites are projected to provide landfill space for North  County for the next 50 years.  </P> <P> On Monday, about 1,000 residents of the Fallbrook area demonstrated their  opposition to a proposal to put a landfill on Aspen Road, voicing concerns over  noise and air pollution, the traffic from an expected 465 daily dump truck  trips, and threats to the county's water supply.  </P> <P> Before Wednesday's meeting, residents near the proposed Gregory Canyon site  expressed similar concerns, including fear that the nearby Pala Indian  Reservation would be hurt.  </P> <P> "Our concerns are water quality, the Indians' rights, and traffic," said  Virginia Buonarati, vice president of the North County Coalition, a  neighborhood group formed specifically to fight the landfill proposal.  </P> <P> "I think that the cities have to take some responsibility for their trash,"  Buonarati said, pointing out that large North County communities such as  Oceanside, Escondido and Vista produce most of the waste that will go into the  landfill. "Why should we take all the trash from the cities? I think they  should look at the cities for trash sites."  </P> <P> The proposed Gregory Canyon site is just south of the San Luis Rey River, and  Buonarati said it will threaten the county's water supply.  </P> <P> "We think the county has done a very poor job in their site selection. For the  county to take a chance on endangering a large percentage of the water supply  is outrageous," Buonarati said. "Trash seems to be more important to the county  than drinking water."  </P> <P> The proposed landfill also would be next to Gregory Mountain, a sacred mountain  to the Pala Indians, said Ruth Harber of the North County Coalition.  </P> <P> "The wall of the mountain will be part of the wall of the dump," Harber said.  "That sacred mountain is just like our Vatican or our churches. You don't put a  dump next to a religious monument."  </P> <P> The draft environmental impact report on the landfill sites conceded that  development of the landfill "would result in significant odor impacts to the  limited population" and that those impacts are "unmitigable."  </P> <P> Impact to the Pala Indians' sacred mountain, Medicine Rock, also "could not be  mitigated below a level of significance," said the draft EIR, which was issued  in January by the Butler Roach Group, the county's environmental consultants.  </P></p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Leading Article: More housing choice needed IT IS not always easy to reconcile choice and ownership, the two central themes of the Conservative manifesto. Last week's Queen's Speech included details of rents-to-mortgages schemes designed to give a further boost to home ownership. Yet with the housing market mired in a depression and mortgage repossessions at historically high levels, increasing choice in housing should now be the priority. The growth in home ownership over the 1980s has been impressive. The number of owner-occupied homes has risen from 11.5m in 1979 to 15.5m last year, 1.4m acquired by council tenants under right-to-buy legislation. The incentives to become a home owner are attractive, with tax breaks for owner-occupiers and discounts for council tenants who buy their homes. The result is that 67 per cent of UK homes are owner-occupied, one of the highest levels of home ownership in the EC. The government now proposes a measure to encourage a further growth in home ownership among council tenants whose income is too low to benefit from the right to buy law. Rents-to-mortgages schemes offer tenants part-ownership of their homes for payments no larger than their current rents. They can either buy the rest in the future, or cash in their share on selling the home. However, pilot schemes have not been raging successes - despite the considerable cost of selling the idea to tenants. In Basildon, for example, of 6,000 tenants eligible, just 264 have applied for the scheme, and only 36 sales have been completed, with about 50 more in the pipeline. The tenants the schemes are aimed at are entitled to better discounts if they wait until they can afford to exercise their right to buy. Housing insecurity In any case, it is arguable that home ownership is reaching its limits in the UK. The surge in repossessions last year suggests that many people who cannot afford it have been tempted into owner-occupation. With almost one in 10 mortgage-holders more than two months in arrears with payments, the growth in home ownership appears to have brought an alarming degree of housing insecurity. Yet for many people, there is little alternative to home ownership. Privately rented accommodation now accounts for 7.5 per cent of homes and has been in decline for 70 years. There has been a pause in the decline in the last year, which may be attributable to the ending of rent control and security of tenure in the 1988 Housing Act. But the depressed housing market has also been a factor, forcing people to rent out homes they cannot sell when transferred to new areas and encouraging would-be buyers to rent until house prices stabilise. Pressing need The choice of 'social housing' - subsidised rented accommodation provided by local authorities or housing associations - is just not available for many. Access is rationed by lengthy queues, and moves within the sector between areas are almost impossible. Increasingly social housing has become a ghetto for the aged, the jobless and low earners who cannot afford to buy their homes. The pressing need is to widen choice by reviving the rented sector. And while some of this can come through the housing associations, financial institutions should be encouraged to support the private rented sector. Yet the only incentive available to developers - the badly targeted Business Expansion Scheme - is to be abolished next year. New tax incentives may be needed to redress the balance between home ownership and renting. For example, exempting rented property from capital gains tax - in the same way as owner-occupied housing - would improve the long-term return on owning rented property. And treating rents as trading income rather than investment income would allow landlords to claim more tax allowances and set business losses off against them. Such incentives would require additional resources which should be found from the subsidy paid to owner-occupiers through mortgage interest tax relief. It is time to tilt the balance somewhat away from home ownership in order to widen choice in the housing market.</p>

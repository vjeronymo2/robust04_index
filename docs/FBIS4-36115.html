			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz has said Iraq's  relations with fraternal, friendly, and other countries are  witnessing positive development in terms of backing Iraq's just  issues.    Attending an evening session of the annual diplomatic  conference of Iraqi ambassadors and heads of diplomatic missions  abroad, Tariq 'Aziz reviewed Iraq's relations with the world's  countries, the development of its relationship with the Security  Council, and the international attitude toward Iraq in general.    During the conference, also attended by Foreign Minister  Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf, the deputy prime minister reviewed  Iraq's diplomatic and political activity in the international  arena in light of the growing international support for Iraq,  even inside the Security Council, to reinforce its just demand  for lifting the unjust blockade imposed on its people, after it  has met all its obligations toward the Security Council's  resolutions.    Tariq 'Aziz also explained the means the inspection teams  had  adopted to fabricate crises and justifications to continue the  aggression in all respects.</p>

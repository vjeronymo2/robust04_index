Go ahead Jesus:    [Cazasola] Yes, Ana Patricia, good afternoon. Both the  rulers and the ruled must be subject to the empire of the law.  No one should act beyond the law because the country's  conditions so demand. Humberto Benitez Trevino said this after  being sworn in as new DF attorney general. He said there will  be no truce for crime and added that no economic or human  resources will be spared to guarantee the security the people of  Mexico City demand. He said he will act with energy wherever  there is impunity.    Humberto Benitez Trevino took over from Rene Gonzalez de la  Vega who in turn was appointed deputy prosecutor for preliminary  enquiries [sub-procurador de averiguaciones previas] for the  Attorney General's Office.    The new DF attorney general said that the firm hand of the  law will be wherever impunity is detected. He also called on  the institution's public servants to act strictly according to  the Constitution, otherwise the corresponding punishment will be  applied.</p>

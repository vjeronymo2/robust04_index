			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Eagle Star takes 10% of Domestic &amp; General EAGLE STAR, the insurance arm of BAT Industries, yesterday acquired a 10 per cent stake in Domestic &amp; General, the fast growing and highly rated domestic appliance breakdown insurer at a cost of about Pounds 6.5m. Eagle Star will not be represented on the D&amp;G board but will be the biggest outside shareholder. 'There is a strong mutual goodwill to sit down and see how we can work together,' said Mr Michael Heath, executive director of Eagle Star. Mr Martin Copley, chairman of D&amp;G, sold 1m shares and Mr Howard James, managing director, sold 100,000 shares at a price of 960p each. Hoare Govett, brokers to D&amp;G, placed 677,970 shares - about 10 per cent of the company's share capital - with Eagle Star, the balance being sold to other institutions. The D&amp;G board, together with Mr Copley's family trusts, continue to have a total holding of 43.2 per cent of the issued share capital. Since obtaining a quote on the Unlisted Securities Market in 1988, D&amp;G has been a star performer, its price rising from 165p to 960p at yesterday's close. Profits have increased from Pounds 1.34m in 1988 to Pounds 2.73m in 1991. Eagle Star is clearly attracted by this strong performance and is also keen to learn from the way D&amp;G has deployed direct distribution and claims servicing techniques in the insurance of domestic appliances like refrigerators, central heating boilers, ovens and televisions. Referring to the development of ideas like telephone helplines for policyholders, service contracts for insured appliances and the direct payment by the insurer of repair costs, Mr Heath said they 'have taken the concept of customer care to its full extent'. He added: 'They also seem to have control of claims costs. It is a very tidy operation.' Initial contacts between the two companies were made about nine months ago, he said.</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Australia seeks a bargain at work: Nikki Tait on planned labour reforms expected to provoke an outcry AUSTRALIA'S Labor government, re-elected last March, may think it has problems with a stalled budget, but its parliamentary battles could just be starting. For next on the agenda is labour market reform legislation, and a deal negotiated this week between the government of prime minister Paul Keating and the nation's trade unions seems certain to provoke maximum outcry. Full details of the industrial relations reform package have not been made public yet. The government-union agreement - reached late on Tuesday - still requires formal ratification by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which it will probably get tomorrow. On the government's side, Mr Laurie Brereton, the industrial relations minister, has yet to sell the proposals to his own Labor party caucus. But assuming no big obstacles emerge in either case, the substance of the package is fairly clear - so much so that employers' organisations are already limbering up for the fight. 'This is 95 per cent an ACTU agenda, 5 per cent a government agenda and zero per cent an employer agenda,' said the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry yesterday. The package will almost certainly contain three elements. The first will centre on an extension of 'devolved' wage bargaining at workplace level. Australian wages have long been set by a complex structure of federal and state commissions, paying little attention to individual employers' circumstances. But, as the country's protectionist tariff barriers have come down and a more 'deregulated' economy has been encouraged, this system has looked increasingly untenable. Over the past few years, therefore, Australia has been edging towards workplace-based bargaining. But the changes have been slow in coming. At present, there are only about 1,150 'enterprise' agreements, covering about 11 per cent of the workforce. At first the government hoped to boost the use of enterprise bargaining by making it an option for the 70 per cent of private sector workers who do not belong to unions. At present, only unions may make certified enterprise agreements. But elements within Australia's union movement - still strong but suffering from declining membership - fought a rearguard action. For months, negotiations between the ACTU and the government stalled. What emerged this week was a compromise. Non-union workers would be able to make enterprise deals through the use of flexibility clauses incorporated into centralised wage awards. But unions would be able to object to such deals through the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the federal arbitration body. Employers' representatives maintain that such a set-up would be unworkable. Although unions would have no power of veto over non-union agreements, the ACCI argues that their ability to obstruct and question deals, through the AIRC, would be enough to deter employers. It is, claims Bryan Noakes, ACCI executive director in Melbourne, an 'effective veto'. The second element likely to be in the reform package would be just as contentious. The government is likely to propose significant changes to sanctions against workers who take industrial action. For a start, the right to strike would be enshrined in law and employers would lose the right to dismiss employees who engaged in industrial action. Employers who were victims of secondary action could have to wait for three days - and would need permission from the AIRC - before seeking legal redress. Most of this would be welcome to a union movement that knows it will not have a Labor government in power for ever and is keen to get protections written into law. The third element likely to be in the package is beefing up the protection of minimum entitlements, including wages, equal pay, parental leave and termination conditions, for all workers, and giving the AIRC an enhanced role in the process. A new federal court - the Industrial Relations Court of Australia - could also be created to take over the industrial relations jurisdiction. These measures would be aimed in part at increasing the federal 'safety net' should individual states choose to pursue more radical labour market policies. Last year, for example, a new conservative government in Victoria introduced industrial relations changes that reduced workers' entitlements and provoked a rash of labour protests. Although the government holds sway in the House of Representatives, it needs the support of minority parties - the Green Party and the Democrats - to get legislation through the Senate. The two Green senators are an unknown quantity but the Democrats have already raised some concerns. They have said they need to see more detail on enterprise bargaining before making a decision. 'We are going to be looking at chapter and verse of how the non-union arrangements are arrived at and none of that detail has yet been spelled out. I think it will take another month to make this legislation fit to hit the floor,' their industrial relations spokesman said yesterday.</p>

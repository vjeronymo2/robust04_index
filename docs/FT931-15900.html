			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Property: Herstmonceux sold THE FATE of Herstmonceux Castle, in east Sussex, has been decided. The huge moated house, built in the 15th century, has been bought for Canada's Queen's University by a grateful former student. A donation of Pounds 6m by an alumnus brings to an end five years of uncertainty for the former home of the Royal Greenwich Observatory. About Pounds 4m will be used in the actual purchase, the remainder going towards a major restoration programme. The gift has been made by Dr Alfred Bader and his wife, Isabel. Dr Bader fled Vienna and the Nazis shortly before the Second World War, visiting Sussex on his way to university at Kingston, Ontario. After completing his studies, Dr Bader established a successful chemical company in America. It had always been his wish to show appreciation to the university and the gift is to enable it to transform the old castle into an international study centre. Queen's principal, David Smith, said this week: 'This splendid gift is an important demonstration of faith in the future of international efforts and contributions possible through the unique participation of a Canadian university.' Five years ago, agents Knight Frank and Rutley attracted criticism for selling the castle, its grounds and the group of equatorial telescope buildings and the Sir Isaac Newton buildings for 'only' Pounds 8m. Recently, joint agents Savills, estimated that to rebuild the castle alone would now cost at least Pounds 50m. Nevertheless, there is a feeling of relief that it has been sold at all, and for a good cause. The castle, its gardens and grounds were bought back in 1988 by Ian Tegg's company, James Developments. Plans were drawn up for conversion of the entire estate into a leisure complex; further land was acquired and by the time the company went into receivership it was said that more than Pounds 20m had been spent. Before the castle's sale to James Developments, astronomer Patrick Moore formed a syndicate in an unsuccessful attempt to raise money to buy the remarkable domed buildings that housed the world-famous telescopes. This week's sale includes all the buildings and most of the land. The sale was on behalf of receivers Grant Thornton, with merchant bankers Guinness Mahon by far the largest creditor. Jeffrey Cooper, deputy chief executive of Guinness Mahon, said: 'We are delighted to have found a buyer for this estate who proposes to use it in a way that will represent such a boon, both to the local community and to the diversity of educational choice in the UK.' The castle was built between 1440 and 1449 by French and English architects employed by Sir Roger Fiennes; there are more than 140 rooms in the main building. Restoration work started in 1911 and was completed in 1935. In 1948, the castle became the home of the Royal Greenwich Observatory and the official residence of the Astronomer Royal.</p>

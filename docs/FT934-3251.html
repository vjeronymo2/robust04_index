			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Premier Group interim earnings up 11% Premier Group, one of South Africa's leading food companies, overcame recessionary trading conditions to record an 11 per cent increase in attributable earnings to R109.3m (Dollars 32.5m) in the six months to October, against R98.1m a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to 132 cents from 119 cents and the dividend was increased to 40 cents per share from 36 cents. Mr Peter Wrighton, chairman, said full-year results would depend on trading during the Christmas and Easter periods and the extent of disruption in the run-up to next April's elections. He added, however, that the group was 'optimistic about the future and cautiously confident that 1994 will see major breakthroughs . . . heralding a new era of economic growth'. On the trading side, turnover rose by 26 per cent to R7.17bn, including United Pharmaceutical Distributors and Bonnita. If these are excluded, and like compared with like, turnover rose by only 6 per cent. This is lower than the overall inflation rate in the country (though food inflation has recently sunk as low as 2.4 per cent) and indicates the severity of the economic recession. Trading profit rose by 19 per cent to R288.4m but net interest paid rose substantially to R40.4m from R21.4m owing to the consolidation of UPD and Bonnita and expansion of the group. Total borrowings rose to R747m from R279.7m. Mr Wrighton said Premier Food and retail store Clicks had underperformed, but Metro Cash and Carry and Premier Pharmaceuticals performed well.</p>

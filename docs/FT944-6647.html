			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Lib Dems face 'low brand loyalty' Taylor Nelson AGB, the UK's biggest market research group, has found some bad news for the Liberal Democrats, Raymond Snoddy writes. A survey for the group, applying the concept of brand loyalty to the main political parties, found that loyalty to the parties is much lower than for leading consumer brands. The bad news for the Liberal Democrats is that like 'most number-three brands', the party not only has a relatively small number of supporters but also a relatively low degree of commitment among those supporters. The survey shows Labour has the highest proportion of hardcore supporters. A total of 57 per cent said they were entrenched or unlikely to back another party. The figures are 40 per cent for the Conservatives and 20 per cent for the Liberal Democrats. Most voters who have switched voting intentions are not very committed to the new party. For example 13 per cent of Tory voters at the last election would now vote Labour, but just one third said they were strongly committed to the new party. Of the 11 per cent of Tory defectors who would now vote Liberal Democrat, less than one fifth are really committed to their new choice. The survey, among 1,000 adults, was carried out after the Labour conference last month.</p>

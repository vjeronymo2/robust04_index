			<p>BFN     [Text] Flight Control Centre (Moscow region) June 24 TASS  -- The Russian cosmonauts continue their mission aboard the Mir  space station.    They conducted geophysical, astrophysical, technological and  medical experiments this week. The crew was also preparing the  ballistic capsule of the Progress M-23 ferry for its return to  the earth.    Friday's programme of work includes astrophysical  experiments  to study gamma-radiation flows of galactic origin and  investigation of properties of various materials in open space.    Under the medical control programme, investigations will be  conducted to check up water-salt metabolism and to take clinical  blood analysis of cosmonauts who experienced zero-gravity  conditions for a long time.    Work in space proceeds according to a preset programme. The  cosmonauts are healthy and feel well.</p>

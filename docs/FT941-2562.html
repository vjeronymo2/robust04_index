			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A collector's menu - Appetisers Judging by the interest shown in the sale of the late Elizabeth David's kitchen contents and books, a lot more people are becoming interested in the history of food and drink. To answer this demand Liz Seeber and her Austrian husband, Gerd, have set up Antiquarian Cookery Books at their home in south London. Liz Seeber had the idea for the company when she inherited a library of 7,000 books in the US. She had to auction the bulk of them and was only able to bring back about 1,200 of the most interesting and valuable to Britain - but the book bug had bitten. Having spent most of her life in publishing - she is a keen book collector and amateur cook - Seeber feels that now is the time to have some fun by turning her hobby into an occupation. If, for example, you are interested in buying Hannah Glasse's The Art of Cookery, then Seeber has a couple of editions - including one printed in London in 1796 for six shillings - at Pounds 175 each. An early Isabella Beeton's The Book of Household Management (Ward, Lock and Tyler), is priced at Pounds 110 and, for those who missed out on the Elizabeth David memorabilia auction, a first edition of English Bread and Yeast cookery, possibly David's best and most scholarly book, is available in good condition for Pounds 35. Do not think you have to fork out a fortune on early English cookery books - prices start as low as Pounds 5 or Pounds 6 and cover many national cuisines. And there are some quirky little bargains in the list - Norman Douglas's Venus in the Kitchen (Heinemann) is a mere Pounds 15 for the 1952 first edition. Drinkers need not feel left out - first editions ranging from Hugh Johnson's 1971 The World Atlas of Wine (Pounds 25) and Andre L Simon's The Commonsense of Wine (Pounds 6.50) are listed. A catalogue giving the prices, illustrators, publishers and detailed condition of each book can be obtained free from Liz Seeber, Antiquarian Cookery Books, 10 The Plantation, London, SE3 OAB. Tel: 081-852-7807. Fax:081-318-4675. Business is mainly by mail order but visitors are welcome by appointment.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: The parting of the ways - The demerging of ECC's construction materials arm It took only six minutes at yesterday's EGM to secure shareholder approval to launch English China Clays as a speciality minerals and chemicals company. Trading in Camas, its demerged construction materials arm, starts today. Yet it has taken almost four years of planning and rationalising for Mr Andrew Teare, chief executive, to get the group into its present shape. When he arrived from Rugby, the construction materials group, Mr Teare was faced with revitalising what was, in effect, a mining company which had mistakenly strayed into housebuilding. After withdrawing from the housing market and cutting more than 20 per cent of the workforce, yesterday's demerger marks the final chapter of ECC's transition. Mr Teare is left with a minerals operation dependent on the paper industry, and a chemicals business based on the recent purchase of Calgon, a US water treatment group. The logic of demerging a business on the verge of recovery while the remaining core operations are a year behind in the economic cycle has come under widespread attack. Mr Teare is confident, however, that the timing of the demerger is an irrelevant issue, since shareholders will have stakes in both companies. He intends to focus on building ECC around two concepts - added value and service. The key to his strategy is research and development, which is at the heart of both divisions. Mr Teare's game plan goes something like this: ECC intends in the short to medium term to remain heavily dependent on the paper industry. While margins have come under severe pressure in recent years due to overcapacity, paper volumes have actually increased at a rate of 3 to 4 per cent a year in recent years. This steady growth allows ECC to avoid the excessive cyclical swings of volatile sectors such as building materials, and provides a certain degree of security, he says. With volumes steady, but margins weak, Mr Teare argues that profit growth must come from technical innovation and the provision of integrated services. For example, his utopia has ECC providing the minerals used to whiten paper and the chemical processes to reclaim the products for recycling. The opportunities presented by environmental legislation are vast, Mr Teare says, when one considers that the paper and packaging industries generate some 40 per cent of the world's landfill demand. The paper industry is also one of the largest producers of waste water. Enter Calgon, the US acquisition upon which ECC intends to build a global speciality chemicals business. ECC's logic is that because it is a substantial user of chemicals in its mineral refining process, there is much to be gained by combining the research and development expertise of the two divisions. If all goes to plan, this would lead to more innovative products, allowing ECC to raise prices and offer integrated services in a world where manufacturers want to deal with fewer suppliers. The theory sounds attractive. There are some sceptics, however, who suspect it may not be so easy to implement. ECC remains largely dependent on its kaolin product, a mineral used to whiten paper, and has stocks which are expected to last for substantially more than 25 years. Yet kaolin is facing heavy competition from cheaper alternatives such as calcium carbonate, which ECC also provides but in much smaller quantities. Although demand for kaolin is growing, it is doing so at a much slower rate than the cheaper alternatives. Furthermore, ECC has had to take some sharp price cuts to keep the market going. 'If kaolin loses market share, then ECC's profits will suffer,' one analyst says. 'We are not convinced that this is a very clear cut recovery story.'</p>

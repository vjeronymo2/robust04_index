			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Givenchy furniture sets record: Saleroom A collection of 97 lots of French furniture and works of art, assembled over 30 years by the French couturier Hubert de Givenchy, sold for FFr155.5m (Pounds 17.67m) at Christie's in Monaco at the weekend This was far in excess of the FFr100m estimate, and set a record for a single owner auction of furniture. The highlight was a 52kg silver chandelier made in 1736 by German goldsmith Behrens to a William Kent design for King George II's palace in Hanover. It was bought by the Middle Eastern collector, Al Tajir for FFr19.98m, an auction record for any item of silver. The chandelier is one of five which once hung in the Queen's Drawing Room and Ballroom at Windsor Castle. The other exceptional price was the FFr18.87m paid for a bureau plat (table) by the celebrated 17th century furniture-maker Boulle. The bureau plat is made of ebony, brass and ormolu, and set a record for a Boulle item. It was the second highest price ever paid for French furniture at auction. In all, 78 lots found buyers. The furniture had been displayed in Mr de Givenchy's Paris house in the heart of the fashionable Fauborg St Germain. Now 66 he has moved to a smaller home. The sale covered a selection of what remains one of the finest antique collections in France.</p>

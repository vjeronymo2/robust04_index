			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Unions divided on pay protest Public-service union leaders are divided over whether to back the call for a day of action on April 11 as a protest against the government's three-year freezing of the public sector pay bill. Clear differences of opinion over the wisdom of going ahead with a co-ordinated attempt to bring 5.8m workers out on strike for 24 hours surfaced yesterday at a TUC meeting of unions representing at least 5m public service workers. Unions are taking soundings among their members to find out how much support they could expect for a one-day disruption. A final decision over the planned day of action will not be taken until February 1 when leaders of all public sector unions, including those in nationalised industries, are due to meet. If the unions agree to call a strike or other disruption on April 11 they are legally obliged to organise postal ballots of their members. This will be costly and some union leaders fear it might expose a lack of enthusiasm among public-sector workers. One senior union official said: 'The trouble is that the media would focus just on how many came out on strike even if they backed action in a ballot and anything less than a massive turnout would be seen as a defeat for us.' The TUC is to demand a meeting with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to seek clarification on how flexible the government's public-sector pay policy will be. The organisation estimates that a pay freeze this year would mean a 6 per cent pay cut in real terms for public-sector workers, although it is possible that efficiency savings could raise as much as 2 per cent in wage increases. Union leaders are also keen to secure assurances from Mr Clarke that public-sector jobs will not be lost as a result of the government's tough pay policy. The public-sector unions intend to campaign vigorously to mobilise public opinion against the government on the wages issue. But officials have no wish to organise any aggressive offensive that alienates people by disrupting services as happened in the 'winter of discontent' of 1978-79.</p>

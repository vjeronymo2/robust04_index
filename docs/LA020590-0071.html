			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEAVYWEIGHTS DOKES, DASCOLA HEADLINE FORUM CARD TONIGHT  </P> <P> Michael Dokes, who in 1982 scored the second-quickest knockout in the history  of heavyweight title fights, takes on Jorge Dascola of Argentina tonight in a  scheduled 12-round bout at the Forum. At stake will be Dokes' World Boxing  Assn.  </P> <P> Intercontinental heavyweight championship, a title that is not as massive as  Dokes was during his last fight.  </P> <P> Weighing 253 1/2 pounds during that Nov. 13 bout, Dokes struggled for seven  rounds before knocking out Lionel Washington in the eighth round.  </P> <P> Dokes will weigh considerably less for the bout against Dascola, who will be  fighting for the first time outside of Argentina. Dascola, 28, is 14-2 with  nine knockouts.  </P> <P> Dokes, 31, is 40-2-2 with 26 knockouts. It will be his 13th fight since  returning to the ring in 1987 after a long layoff caused by a cocaine  addiction. His only loss during the comeback came in March of 1989 when he was  stopped in the 10th round by Evander Holyfield.  </P> <P> Dokes put his name in the record book eight years ago when he stopped Mike  Weaver in just 63 seconds to capture the WBA championship. Only Jim Jeffries  did it in less time. He knocked out Jack Finnegan in 55 seconds in 1900.  </P> <P> In another bout tonight, Joaquin Velasquez (21-2-1, 16 knockouts) of the  Dominican Republic fights Derrick Kelly (24-2-2, eight knockouts) of Los  Angeles in a scheduled 10-round super welterweight match.  </P> <P> Also on the card are the undefeated Ruelas brothers of Arleta. Gabriel, a  junior lightweight, is 18-0 with 10 knockouts. Rafael, a featherweight, is 12-0  with 10 knockouts. RICH TOSCHES  </P></p>

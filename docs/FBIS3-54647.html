He highly appreciated the pledge made by CIS member states  not to interfere into one another's internal affairs, respect  one another's territorial integrity, never apply economic  pressure and fight expansionism, chauvinism and ethnic enmity.    Suleymenov also stressed the importance of Ashgabat  decisions  on the setting up of a Commonwealth economic union.    "We should follow the example set by Western countries," he  emphasized. In his view, if the CIS economic union is a  success, a transnational currency may be negotiated.</p>

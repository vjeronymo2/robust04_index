			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Arts: Good Friday's Television Worthiness and chunkiness mark the Good Friday schedules. This afternoon BBC2 screens Jonathan Miller's production of one of the greatest pieces of music ever created: Bach's St Matthew Passion. It lasts 2 hours 40 minutes (4.45). Among the blockbuster movies the one shown least often before is Bertolucci's The Last Emperor which was shot in Peking's Forbidden City, lasts three hours, and won nine Oscars. To its credit ITV is showing it uncensored, which means odds and ends of sex and violence (10.20). Though a moderate admirer of Patrick Malahide I find The Inspector Alleyn Mysteries among the least appealling of television's classic English detective adaptations. Today's story is 'Dead Water' (9.00 BBC1). I shall, however, try to watch the one-hour special Penn And Teller: Don't Try This At Home. Although it repeats material from the recent series by these two American conjurors, it was so bizarre, naughty and funny that it will reward a second look (10.30 C4).</p>

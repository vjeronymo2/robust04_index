			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of North American Business Locations (10): Where small-town values predominate - Martin Dickson examines why the Rocky Mountain states have become so popular Why are the Rocky Mountain states the fastest growing region of the US? What are the factors encouraging businesses to relocate to the area? The six states down the spine of the Rocky Mountains - Montana, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico - together with neighbouring Arizona and Nevada, are expected to show growth of around 5.3 per cent this year and 4 per cent in 1995. The expansion is all the more impressive in that it is not due to booming oil or metal prices. The Rockies have traditionally been dependent on mining, oil, farming and forestry, and the region has a history of booms and busts tied to commodity cycles. Denver, Colorado, the Rockies' main city, enjoyed strong growth in the late 1970s, thanks to the global oil crisis, but the region largely missed out on the strong economic growth which characterised most other regions of the US during the 1980s. The current expansion is relatively broad-based, and includes a significant number of high technology companies. But while impressive, it needs to be put in perspective: the Rocky Mountains are one of the least significant economic regions of the US, and the base from which the area is growing is small relative to other parts of the nation. The gross regional product of the Rocky states was only Dollars 337bn in 1993, compared to well over Dollars 1,000bn for the booming South Atlantic region, which has Atlanta as its main business centre. The region's high overall growth rate also hides considerable differences in the various parts of what is an extraordinarily diverse area, ranging from the rolling wheat fields of eastern Montana to the deserts of the south-west. So while cities such as Las Vegas, Nevada, Salt Lake City, Utah, and Boise, Idaho, are all booming, predominantly rural Wyoming, with no large cities and poor air transport services, is enjoying only modest growth. All that said, rapid growth in the Rockies is significant, in that it points up business location factors which may become increasingly important. Three reasons for the influx of companies and individual entrepreneurs stand out: the relatively low cost of doing business in the area; its pro-business climate; and its open spaces and stunning scenery. So far, the Rocky Mountain states have not used lavish tax incentives to attract business - because they have not needed, or been able to afford to do so. There are, inevitably, exceptions: last year Rio Rancho, New Mexico, gave a Dollars 114m tax incentive package to encourage Intel, the California-based semi-conductor manufacturer, into expanding its plant. What the Rocky states do use to lure business are propaganda campaigns, aimed in large measure at Californian companies, which highlight the fact that the cost of doing business there is relatively cheap. Many of the campaigns are aimed at small companies - the kind creating most of the job growth in the US. Labour costs are well below the national average, and so are many other business expenses. Idaho, for example, reckons that a Californian company moving to the state can not only halve its pay bill, but it can cut fringe benefits around 50 per cent, the cost of workers' compensation for injury by a similar amount, and utility costs by more than 60 per cent. Companies which have set up substantial operations in Boise include technology groups Hewlett-Packard and Micron Technology. Land prices are also far cheaper in the Rockies than in California, though the recent boom has begun to put significant upward pressure on house prices. The states have also adopted aggressively pro-business policies, for example by imposing moderate business taxes and cutting the red tape required to set up shop. One company which relocated last year to Rio Rancho, New Mexico, obtained a building permit in less than two weeks at a cost of just Dollars 2,200. It reckoned that the same exercise in southern California might have taken 18 months and cost Dollars 40,000. Another factor working in the Rockies' favour is the work ethic, which remains high in this area, as in many parts of the US which have traditionally relied on farming. 'Labour is cheaper and the work ethic is higher, so you get more bang for your buck,' says an official at a company which moved from California to Boise three years ago. The state of Utah has benefited particularly strongly from this perception. Some 70 per cent of its population belongs to the Mormon church, based in Salt Lake City. Mormons are known for their strong family values and emphasis on hard work and education. Some companies also hope that the high quality of life in the Rockies will enable them to attract and keep well-educated employees. The mountains offer a wealth of outdoor leisure activities, ranging from skiing in the winter to trout fishing and horseback riding in the summer. The crime rate is generally low and traffic congestion minimal. Small-town values predominate. Says Ms DeeDee Corradini, mayor of Salt Lake City: 'A decade ago, when I talked to businesses about moving to an area like this, they wanted to know what it meant for them financially. Today, I'm finding more and more asking: 'What's the quality of life? Will our employees and their families be happy living there?'' However, California is fighting back against the lure of the Rockies - for example, by promising to cut its red tape - and the Rockies also have some significant drawbacks for companies looking for the right business location. The smaller cities and towns in the region have unimpressive air transport links with the rest of America. Continental Airlines, for example, one of a small number of airlines serving Montana, has withdrawn completely from the state this year. Small-town virtues can also mean small-town dullness, and some companies could find it hard to get sophisticated employees to relocate to the region from America's principal cities. As for foreign companies, Asian ones are likely to prefer a West coast location (though Utah has attracted some Japanese investment) and European ones may be put off by the significantly greater distance from headquarters  -both in distance and time zone - than the Atlantic seaboard. The present boom is also bringing new social problems to the region: many long-time Rocky Mountain residents resent the newcomers, and there have been confrontations in some Utah towns between straight-laced Mormons and racier Californian newcomers.</p>

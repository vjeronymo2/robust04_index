No 523; approved by Order No  26 of 9 March 1994 RD-04-07-94]    [Text]  <H5>  1. General Regulations </H5>   1.1. The issuing of provisional permits for the construction  of nuclear power plant (AS) units for civilian purposes in the  Russian Federation is carried out by Russian Gosatomnadzor  [Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety] on the basis  of the Statute on Russian Gosatomnadzor, approved by order of  the President of the Russian Federation on 5 June 1992 No  283-rp, with amendments approved by order of the President of  the Russian Federation of 16 September 1993, No 636-rp.    1.2. This Statute on the procedure for issuing provisional  permits from Russian Gosatomnadzor for construction of nuclear  power plant units for civilian purposes (henceforth called the  Statute) establishes the procedure for obtaining and  accompanying a provisional permit for construction of AS units  and is in force during the transitional period until the Statute  on the procedure for issuing licenses for the construction of  nuclear power plants goes into effect.    1.3. The statute applies to the construction of AS units on  Russian Federation territory.    1.4. The provisional permit of Russian Gosatomnadzor for the  construction of an AS unit is an official document, which:    --permits the construction of a specific AS unit;    --establishes the conditions under which the construction of  the unit is permitted.    1.5. A provisional permit for construction is issued by  Russian Gosatomnadzor individually for each AS unit.    1.6. This Statute also applies to facilities (RAO, KhOYaT  [chemical weapons and nuclear equipment] and other storages),  the construction of which on the territory of existing AS is  carried out according to individual itemized lists.    1.7. The issue of a provisional permit for construction of  AS  units begun before this Statute was introduced is based on:    --the fact of acknowledgement by Russian Gosatomnadzor of  earlier issued documents permitting construction of AS units;    --carrying out an evaluation of the safety of an AS unit,  including the conditions of its location, on the basis of an  examination of the documents submitted to justify the  application;    --making the necessary inspections;    --establishing the conditions for the functioning of the  provisional permit.    1.8. This Statute applies to the period up to completing the  construction and putting into operation the basic facilities (in  accordance with the itemized list) and establishes the following  stages in the procedure for obtaining a provisional permit for  construction of a nuclear power plant unit:    --issue of a preliminary decision on the site for  construction of the AS unit;    --issue of a provisional permit for construction of the AS  unit.    The stage of issuing the preliminary decision on the site  applies only to sites for the AS units intended for construction.    1.9. A provisional permit for construction of an AS unit  will  be issued to an enterprise to which federal property of the AS  has been transferred (or will be transferred in accordance with  a contract with an investor) for full economic jurisdiction  (henceforth called the Enterprise) and which was founded in  accordance with the RSFSR Law "On Enterprises and  Entrepreneurial Activity" and, if the Enterprise:    --adheres to the principles, criteria and requirements for  nuclear and radiation safety which, on the basis of its  competence, Russian Gosatomnadzor establishes by means of rules  and norms, decrees, management and the conditions of the  provisional permit for construction;    --presents Russian Gosatomnadzor with information pertaining  to all aspects of constructing the AS unit, in the amount and in  the period established by Russian Gosatomnadzor;    --fulfills the "Requirements for Operational Organization of  a Nuclear Power Plant" (RD-04-03-93), approved by Russian  Gosatomnadzor on 26 May 1993.    1.10. A provisional permit for construction of an AS unit is  in effect throughout the period of its force, unless Russian  Gosatomnadzor suspends or discontinues the force of the  provisional permit.    1.11. If the Enterprise is liquidated or reorganized, the  provisional permit for construction of an AS unit ceases to be  in force.  <H5>  2. Procedure for Obtaining a Preliminary Decision on the </H5> Site for Construction of an AS Unit    2.1. The preliminary decision on the site, issued to the  Enterprise according to the results of an examination of the  materials substantiating the application, is an official  document of Russian Gosatomnadzor on the suitability in  principle of the site for construction of the AS.    2.2. To obtain the preliminary decision on the site for  construction of the AS unit, the Enterprise submits to Russian  Gosatomnadzor, addressed to the chairman, an application in five  copies (the number of copies of individual documents may be more  precisely defined by Russian Gosatomnadzor), including:    --a pro forma statement, presented as Appendix No 1;    --a copy of the document verifying the state registration of  the Enterprise;    --a copy of the Enterprise charter;    --a copy of the document on the designation of the  Enterprise  by the higher state administrative body, responsible for  carrying out the activity at all stages of the AS life cycle;    --a set of documents substantiating the application in  accordance with Appendix No 2;    --an obligation (letter of guarantee), confirming the  existence of financial potentials and readiness to pay the  expenditures for carrying out expert examinations of the  documents substantiating the application;    --a copy of the act of preliminary agreement on the location  of the AS unit, without withdrawal of the land parcel.    2.3. All the technical documents should be filled out in  accordance with the requirements for normative-technical  documents on nuclear and radiation safety. Copies of the  documents should be certified by the signature of the director  of the Enterprise and the seal of the Enterprise.    2.4. Having arrived at Russian Gosatomnadzor, the  application  is registered in the Business Administration office in  accordance with the established procedure and is sent to the  Administration for Organization of Licensing Procedures and  Coordination of Regional Bodies.    2.5. The Administration for Organization of Licensing  Procedures and Coordination of Regional Bodies organizes and  implements verification of the application materials and  adherence to the rules for making them out, and determines the  conformance of the composition of the documents submitted to the  requirements of the existing guideline documents of Russian  Gosatomnadzor.

			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / UK Company News: 1994: a year of deceleration - Hickson's 'annus horribilis' and its recovery hopes Hickson International is stepping up its search for new customers following an annus horribilis in which the speciality chemicals company has been hit by soap wars, underperforming subsidiaries and a series of industrial accidents. Mr Dennis Kerrison, chief executive, will be glad to see the back of 1994: a year that has seen a profits warning and the prospect of an empty plant following Unilever's decision to stop buying manganese catalyst, the controversial ingredient in Persil Power and other detergents. 'We've been hit hard and it could be 1997 before we see sizeable profits growth.' Although he admits that Hickson's reputation has been tarnished by accidents and its failure to deal quickly with operating problems in the US, he singles out one overriding cause for the malaise - damaged laundry. When Hickson secured the contract for Unilever's new range of dirt-busting detergents, it enjoyed a rampant share price which touched 225p earlier this year. But claims that its manganese 'accelerator' left clothes holed and faded helped send it into freefall. As the criticism mounted, Hickson started drawing up contingency plans for PharmaChem, the subsidiary which depended solely on the Unilever contract. At one stage, the shares fell to 106p and industry analysts voiced serious concerns about the company's strategy. Hickson was forced on to the back foot primarily by Unilever's procrastination. 'Unilever was in complete disarray and they kept asking for more time before telling Hickson if they would be taking up their orders,' according to one industry insider. There was, therefore, almost tangible relief at the chemical company's West Yorkshire headquarters when Unilever announced its decision to stop purchasing further supplies of the accelerator. It ended some of the uncertainty over the future of PharmaChem; cleared the way for compensation payments - still under negotiation; and enabled Hickson to pursue new business. The company was at least prepared for the worst. Even when it was still tied to the Unilever contract, a team was set up to explore alternative uses for CB1, the PharmaChem plant where the accelerator was manufactured. It has picked up orders from two large pharmaceutical companies, yet to be named, and aims to develop existing businesses with customers such as Merck and Wellcome. 'If we had waited four months before doing anything, we'd be looking at a black hole now. We've avoided that,' says Mr Kerrison. The shares have recovered a little, closing unchanged yesterday at 122p, and City analysts believe there is potential for a long-term revival. 'The company is now looking quite attractive as an investment and, if the management sticks to its aims, the outlook could be reasonably bright,' says Mr Martin Evans of Hoare Govett. Nevertheless, most analysts have cut their profits forecasts from a top range of Pounds 28m to between Pounds 21m and Pounds 23m this year, with no pick up likely in the near future. Some are also talking of a possible bid for the group which, with its revival prospects and undemanding forward multiple of 13, could prove a worthwhile acquisition for some of its big rivals. But reviving Hickson will not happen rapidly. New orders for the PharmaChem plant will have little effect on 1995 profits, and the group still faces rebuilding costs of Pounds 25m on CB2, PharmaChem's other plant, which was devastated by a fire last year. Some of its overseas sites may be closed or merged, and raw material price increases have forced a rationalisation costing Pounds 4.5m this year. 'We paid the price for developing a product for one big customer who got it wrong in the market place,' says Mr Kerrison. 'But all the bad news we know of is over. Now we must put something on the bottom line for shareholders.'</p>

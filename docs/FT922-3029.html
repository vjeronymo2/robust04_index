			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: China's internal reforms hold key to long-term prospects - Investing in . . . Hong Kong / John Authers argues that it might not yet be time to sell IS IT time to sell Hong Kong? Common sense suggests that it must be. The Hang Seng index, which measures the Hong Kong market's performance, has risen 64 per cent over the past year, and 40.3 per cent this year alone. Last week it broke through the 6,000 barrier, having stood at only 3,004 at the beginning of last year. These figures have the look of a peak about them. Then, too, the political risk which lurks once China's leader Deng Xiaoping dies scarcely inspires hope for sustained strong rises. For once, professional fund managers in the area seem to agree with the layman's view - few of them are happy to predict continued growth on anything like this scale. But that does not necessarily mean that the time has come to sell. And political developments could yet leave the Hong Kong market looking attractive. What has fuelled the recent performance? There seem to be two main reasons. The China factor. For a year or so after the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing, exposure to China was a thoroughly negative influence on the Hong Kong market. But the shock of Tiananmen has worn off while China's economy has grown strongly. Economic, if not political, reform seems well entrenched. The need for it is not disputed by top Chinese officials, giving observers hope that it will survive the present leader, Deng Xiaoping. Pamela Chan, manager of Sun Life's recently-launched Pacific Growth unit trust, points to a front page editorial in the state-owned People's Daily: 'Reform and opening up  .. is our only choice.' The word 'capitalism' is even being used by communist leaders, she says. Hong Kong has high exposure to Guangdong province, which neighbours it on the Chinese mainland. Growth there last year was 13.5 per cent, almost twice the national average. While that level is not sustainable indefinitely, many believe in China's capacity for growth for years to come. All of this has eroded what analysts call Hong Kong's 'China discount.' What was perceived as the political risk posed by China's takeover in five years meant that investors were prepared to buy Hong Kong shares only at a low rating, in terms of price-earnings ratio, compared with the rating of companies in other Pacific economies. The positive signs coming out of China have eroded most of that discount. According to Datastream, the historic p/e ratio on the Hang Seng index dropped to 8.9 in the weeks following Tiananmen but now stands at 16.2, having been only 12.7 at the beginning of this year. Hong Kong is now almost in line with other Pacific economies, although ratios are still below the headier heights of 1987. If you agree with this argument, there is no reason to expect the market to endure a cyclical fall. It has simply enjoyed a re-rating in response to new data. But this argument also points to slower market growth in future. China's development must be swift indeed to see the discount eroded much more in the next few years. Interest rates. In real terms, Hong Kong credit is absurdly cheap. While inflation hovers around double figures, overnight bank lending rates are only around 2 per cent. There is no rationale for this within the colony's economy. Interest rates are pegged at this level only because the Hong Kong dollar is tied to the US dollar. Thus, base rates have had to follow US rates downwards to stop traders profiting from 'arbitrage.' Unsurprisingly, the Hong Kongese are not very interested in saving at present - the rate they earn on deposit is barely half that of inflation. But the property market has had a jamboree, which the government is trying to dampen. Not only are loans cheap but residents also are desperate to gain a hedge against inflation, which property traditionally can be expected to provide. Equities also have benefited from this bizarre set of circumstances. While interest rates stay unnaturally low, strong growth in property and equity prices should continue. Underlying corporate earnings also have been fuelled by the credit boom, as people have spent to consume rather than save. If forecasts for final-year earnings are correct, then there is still value in the market, with prospective ratings of around 11.5, and this effect has not been played out fully. But KC Lee, Hong Kong-based fund manager with Fidelity, offers a warning. 'At some time, Hong Kong will have to pay a price for what is going on. We can't have a system which discourages savings without a price being paid.' It is possible to view this more optimistically - for example, Chan says that the island should benefit from a US recovery and forecasts earnings per share growth for 1992 of 24 per cent - but the interest rate effect must be a reason to expect a slow-down in the market before long. So, any investment judgment on the Hong Kong economy must be balanced finely. Both China and interest rate policies have been positive factors over the past year. The former should continue to fuel growth for many years  - although the possibility China could lose its Most Favoured Nation trading status with the US would dent this. The latter is unlikely to remain suppositive for many more months. The result is reflected in fund managers' allocation decisions. Most are still overweight in Hong Kong, but their weightings have been cut slightly and are likely to be cut further. It is still not time to sell Hong Kong in a big way. Working out how to assess a Hong Kong weighting is difficult enough, as differing accounting standards, combined with restrictions on foreign investment, make it very hard to compare the size of the different Pacific markets. Bruce Seton, Hong Kong manager with Gartmore, says that in market capitalisation Hong Kong should take about 57 per cent of the Pacific Basin market. But doubts about the best way to measure this mean that Gartmore treats 50 per cent as a 'neutral' weighting for Hong Kong - almost exactly its present level. Sun Life's Pacific fund has a 49 per cent weighting in Hong Kong, compared with a projected weighting of 36 per cent when it was launched. Fidelity's Far East Excluding Japan fund now has a weighting of 48 per cent in Hong Kong and Lee says he expects the weighting to be lower six months from now. Thus, Far East Excluding Japan funds are arguably the most prudent way to buy exposure to Hong Kong. If, however, you are convinced about long-term Chinese economic reform, you could try a Hong Kong unit trust. There are five - from Gartmore, Commercial Union, INVESCO, Providence Capitol and James Capel - and they are the top performers of all unit trusts over the past year, having logged rises varying from Gartmore's 93.8 per cent to Capel's 37.5 per cent. These funds are definitely not for the risk-averse. But Chris Mitchell, of CU, tells why they might appeal. 'I think the full potential of China is greatly under-estimated. About 35 per cent of dollars earned are just being saved in southern China at present because they have nothing to spend it on. But the spending power is very like Japan.'</p>

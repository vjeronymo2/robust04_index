			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 25 (XINHUA) -- At least 30 Asian  Pacific Americans were killed in 1993 as a result of homicides  in which racial animus was suspected or proven, the National  Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium reported today.    In its "Audit of Violence Against Asian Pacific Americans  1993," the first comprehensive, nationwide, non-governmental  survey to assess the extent of anti-Asian violence, the  consortium found 335 reported anti-Asian incidents in 1993, or  one incident almost every day, despite significant  underreporting.    "As this report documents, incidents of anti-Asian violence  are a problem for communities around this country," said U.S.  Congressman Norm Mineta, calling the consortium's report "a  telling indicator, both of the scope of this problem and how far  we have to go to solve it."    "Our trade tensions with Asian nations, the shakiness of the  economy, and racism continue to drive a search for scapegoats,"  said Mineta. "All too often, those scapegoats turn out to have  Asian Pacific faces."    The consortium found the total of 335 anti-Asian incidents  includes 153 incidents with demonstrable anti-Asian motivation  and 182 incidents where this animus was suspected.    "Among the incidents where there was demonstrable anti-Asian  animus, assault, vandalism and threat or intimidation were  reported most commonly," said Philip Tajitsu Nash, executive  director of the consortium.    The study found Asian Pacific Americans are most vulnerable  where they reside, with commercial business sites also being  dangerous places.    In one incident, Sam Nang Nhem, a 21-year-old Cambodian  American, was killed on August 14, 1993, when Nhem and his  family were picnicking at their home in Fall River,  Massachusetts.    As Nhem was disposing of the trash in a dumper only 100  yards  from his apartment, he was brutally attacked by white  neighborhood residents, the report said. Nhem, father of a  four-month-old infant, was called a "gook," repeatedly kicked  and finally beaten to death.    The Federal Bureau of Investigation states that the most  frequently-reported anti-Asian crime is intimidation, but in  contrast, our finding are that assault and vandalism are most  common, said Nash.    "Anti-Asian violence is widely underreported," Nash said.  "as  of January 1994, most jurisdictions had statistics for only the  first three months of 1993."    He said the majority of incident reports were collected in  New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco while limited data was  available from only 14 states.    He urged federal and local governments to thoroughly  investigate all suspected hate crimes, promptly and completely  collect hate crime statistics and recruit more Asian police  officers to have an ethnically and linguistically diversed law  enforcement force.</p>

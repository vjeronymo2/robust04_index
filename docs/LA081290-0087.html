			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RECYCLER HEADED FOR TRASH HEAP?;  </P> <P> NO TIME TO LOSE IN HELPING HOME-GROWN COMPANY FIND A PERMANENT HOME  </P> <P> Curbside recycling programs, which rank among the best of local innovations,  were themselves trashed by shortsighted government agencies in two communities  last week. There is still time to clean up the mess in North County, but the  city of San Diego may find itself atop a heap of trouble because of its lack of  action.  </P> <P> In Encinitas, an advisory board recommended against Solana Recyclers' plan to  expand its quarter-acre site off El Camino Real, despite a sizable increase in  the amount of paper, glass, aluminum and plastic the organization picks up in  Encinitas, Del Mar and Solana Beach. Even worse, the board advised the Planning  Commission not to renew Solana Recyclers' temporary operating permit, a  decision that would force the 7-year-old organization to soon shut down if the  Planning Commission and City Council agree.  </P> <P> Never mind that Solana Recyclers, which started with two UC San Diego students  and a pickup truck, is a home-grown success story that now employs 25 people  and collects 450 tons of refuse a month.  </P> <P> More importantly, all California cities must, by state law, reduce their trash  outputs by 25% in the next five years, and by 50% in the next decade. Any  recommendation that would cause even a temporary disruption of recycling is  counterproductive.  </P> <P> The panel apparently supports Solana Recyclers' efforts, but wants to force it  out of a site intended as a temporary home three years ago. The panel believes  that the recyclers should get serious about finding a permanent site. The  recyclers say they have looked at 140 parcels in Encinitas alone, without  finding a suitable one that they can afford.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission -- or, if necessary, the City Council -- should extend  Solana Recyclers' permit. Then the three cities involved and the county (which  owns the land Solana Recyclers is now leasing) must get together and find this  invaluable organization a permanent, adequately sized home.  </P> <P> The city of San Diego has a bigger problem. With four of its nine members  absent, the City Council failed Tuesday to muster the five votes needed to put  before voters an amendment to the People's Ordinance of 1919.  </P> <P> That is the anachronistic charter provision that mandates free trash pickup for  single family homes. (Apartment and condominium residents already pay to have  their trash hauled away.)  </P> <P> Homeowners would have paid $8.50 monthly for trash pickup if the amendments had  been approved, part of which was to expand the city's successful curbside  recycling pickup program, from the current 80,000 households to 300,000 homes  citywide.  </P> <P> A citywide recycling program could reduce San Diego's trash pile by 5% to 8%.  But that won't happen, because there's no money for the expansion.  </P> <P> Mayor Maureen O'Connor and Councilman Ron Roberts voted against placing the  amendments on the ballot. We don't agree with their decisions, but at least  they made choices. Council members Judy McCarty, Bob Filner and John Hartley  supported the proposal.  </P> <P> Where were council members Abbe Wolfsheimer, Wes Pratt, Linda Bernhardt and  Bruce Henderson when the environment needed them?  </P></p>

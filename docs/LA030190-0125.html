It frightens me that  despite constant warning by scientists, no concerted effort is being made by  the nations of the world to prevent it.  </P> <P> When we gamble on the validity of the Greenhouse effect, it's like playing  Russian roulette. The Greenhouse gun is aimed at our world. Is the barrel  loaded or empty? If nothing is done, we'll soon find out.  </P> <P> BING LEE  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW LEBANON LEADER DUMPS AOUN CABINET  </P> <P> Lebanese President Elias Hrawi formed a new reconciliation government Saturday  just eight hours after his election and moved rapidly to dismiss the interim  military government headed by Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun.  </P> <P> Setting the stage for a confrontation with the embattled Christian forces  commander, Hrawi abolished Aoun's three-member Cabinet and launched  consultations aimed at appointing a new army commander, perhaps as early as  this week.  </P> <P> But Aoun, barricaded in a bunker beneath the presidential palace in Christian  East Beirut, announced that he does not view the election of Hrawi as any more  valid than that of his predecessor, Rene Mouawad, elected Nov. 5 and then  killed in a massive bomb blast 17 days later.  </P> <P> "Both have been elected under Syrian occupation," Aoun said in a statement  released Saturday. "They should have waited to find out who killed Mouawad  before appointing a new president."  </P> <P> Mouawad was buried Saturday in his hometown of Zagharta with six of the  bodyguards who were among the 23 others slain in Wednesday's bomb blast. Tens  of thousands of mourners lined the streets, and weeping women threw themselves  on the coffins before they were lowered into their graves, according to news  agency reports from Lebanon.  </P> <P> Pope John Paul II sent an envoy to convey his "deep sorrow and condolences" to  Mouawad's family, and in a message read at the funeral urged the Lebanese to  "practice self-restraint, reject desperation and proceed with reconciliation."  </P> <P> Hrawi, who did not attend the funeral because of security concerns, appointed  veteran Sunni Muslim politician Salim Hoss as his prime minister. Hoss named  the remainder of the 14-member Cabinet that will attempt to assert authority  over a country that has been without a unified national government for more  than a year.  </P> <P> The Cabinet includes representatives of all of Lebanon's warring sectarian  communities, including the Maronite, Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholic and  Armenian Christians, the Sunni and Shiite Muslims and the Druze.  </P> <P> Powerful Muslim militia chieftains Walid Jumblatt and Nabih Berri won posts as  minister of transportation and public works, and minister of electrical, water  resources and housing, respectively. Both had served in the Muslim government  headed by Hoss that has rivaled Aoun's Christian government since the Lebanese  Parliament was unable to elect a president in 1988.  </P> <P> The new Cabinet list also includes hard-line Christian Parliament deputy George  Saadeh, head of the Falangist Party and a coalition of other right-wing  Christian groups, in an apparent attempt to draw Aoun's historic base of  support into the new reconciliation government.  </P> <P> However, it was not clear whether Saadeh would accept the appointment. Saadeh,  like some other Christian deputies who defied Aoun and voted for a new Arab  League peace plan last month in Taif, Saudi Arabia, has not yet returned to  Lebanon and did not participate in the presidential balloting Friday night.  </P> <P> Aoun ordered the Christian deputies not to endorse the accord because it  contained no provision for immediate withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian troops  still in Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate. The latest round of  fighting started last spring when Aoun vowed to forcibly eject the troops, and  ended with a cease-fire Sept. 23 after more than 800 had been killed.  </P> <P> "I was surprised by my appointment," Saadeh said in a statement broadcast by  the Christian Voice of Lebanon radio. "I don't oppose the new government, but  the question of my participation must first be approved by the Falange  politburo."  </P> <P> The fear of reprisals may be well-founded. The houses of seven Christian  Parliament members in East Beirut have been bombed since approval of the peace  accord in Taif, and a caller to a Western news agency Thursday, identifying  himself as a spokesman for the Christian Solidarity Front, warned the  legislators that they would face the same fate as Mouawad if they elected a  president to replace him.  </P> <P> Mouawad was killed despite stringent security measures taken by Syrian  authorities to protect him. His apartment, located adjacent to the Syrian troop  headquarters, was protected by steel sheets and bulletproof glass, and his car  was surrounded by armed escorts as it paraded through West Beirut during  Wednesday's independence day celebration.  </P> <P> The bomb that killed him, authorities said, was placed in an empty store along  the motorcade route and detonated by remote control. It was large enough,  containing an estimated 550 pounds of explosives, that it could hardly miss.  </P> <P> It was not clear what steps the new government will have to take in order to  dislodge Aoun. Mouawad had remained at a standoff with the feisty military  commander throughout his 17 days in office, in large part because of the  10,000-strong Christian Lebanese Forces that so far have refused to come over  to the new government.  </P> <P> They are no match for the 40,000 Syrian troops that control two-thirds of  Lebanon and are now available to back Hrawi's government. Officials of the new  government appeared more inclined to focus on other means of persuasion, but  Hrawi, in his inaugural address, said that while he is seeking to cooperate  with all Lebanese "without any exceptions," the move toward peace "is capable  of wiping out whoever stands in its way."  </P></p>

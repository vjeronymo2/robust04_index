			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Shuxin (3769 2885 2450), affiliated with </F> the Population Economics Studies Institute at the Beijing  Academy of Economics: "The Changing Perception of Childbearing  Among Beijing's Urban Women"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The Population Economics  Studies Institute at the Beijing Academy of Economics conducted  a sample survey on marriage and the family in Beijing's urban  and suburban districts, polling 2,162 married women betwen the  ages of 20 and 54. To facilitate comparative analysis, we have  divided the surveyed women into three groups: 1) those born  before 1949; 2) Those born between 1950 and 1959; 3) those  born from 1960 to 1972.  <H5>  I. The Childbearing Perceptions of Women Born in the Three </H5> Different Periods    Women born from 1937 to 1941, on one hand were more deeply  affected by the old society's ideology, culture, and customs,  with the feudal ethical concepts of "the earlier the marriage,  the sooner one has children," "the earlier one has a son, the  sooner one benefits," passing on to future generations that  received from the ancestors," and "regarding men as superior to  women," deeply rooted in their minds. On the other hand, during  their childbearing peak, as population growth restraint forces  had not been officially established, leaving this group of women  in the midst of the conversion from old to new population and  childbearing forces, they essentially followed traditional  childbearing perceptions, with their key childbearing  motivations being "passing on to future generations that  received from the ancestors," and "raising children to take care  of them in their old age." As they were influenced by these  childbearing motivations and restraints, they particularly  favored boys, inevitably striving to achieve their sex bias in  children through having many children, which was accompanied by  early marriage, early childbearing, and multiple births.    Marriage and childbearing are closely interrelated, with age  at first marriage having a definite restrictive impact on  childbearing age and number of children born. In China, early  marriage is generally accompanied by early childbearing, with an  earlier beginning-childbearing age. Early marriage and  childbearing also extend the real childbearing-age period,  increasing the possibility of multiple childbearing. Real  survey results fully confirm this point.... As women born in  this period had traditonal childbearing perceptions, their  childbearing behavior showed up as early marriage, early  childbearing, and multiple births. The number of women in this  group who were married before the age of 19 made up 23.2 percent  of the population in their age-group, with as many as 56.3  percent of early-married women bearing more than three children,  and 33.6 percent having two children.    Women born between 1942 and 1949 were 16-23 years old by the  mid-1960s, beginning to be affected by traditional  family-planning indoctrination. Restricted by family planning  policy, this group of women had a controlled childbearing  pattern. Their number of marriages before the age of 19 was  down, with higher percentages of marriage between the ages of 20  and 29, one child, and two children, being respectively 75.2  percent, 71.5 percent, and 19.9 percent. This group of women  were characterized by a composite childbearing pattern of both  traditional and controlled forms coexisting.    Women born in the 1950s were 21-30 years of age by the  1980s,  by which time China had officially announced a revision of its  family planning policy, advocating that, except for in minority  nationality regions with sparse populations, a couple should  generally have only one child. The CPC Central Committee issued  an open letter on the matter of controlling China's population  growth to all Communist Party and CYL members. China achieved  marked family planning successes in the 1980s primarily due to  the greater contributions made at the time by women from 30 to  40 years of age. This group of women's first-marriage age was  generally higher, with an average first-marriage age of more  than 26, or nearly three years later than that of women born  before 1949. Those married at older than 25 rose in percentage  from the preceding group's 28.7 percent to 70.1 percent. Due  to comprehensive factors, such as later marriage age, shorter  childbearing period, and longer time between childbearing, the  percentage of women born in the 1950s bearing only one child was  up sharply to 94.73 percent, with only 4 percent having two  children, and the incidence of three children essentially  stopped. As to the lower level of childbearing by women born in  this period, it was the government's family planning policy that  played the decisive role.    Women born from the 1960s on reached marriage and  childbearing age only by 1980, by which time it was universally  advocated that a couple have only one child, with emphasis on a  policy of late marriage and childbearing. Meanwhile,  influenced by social and economic reform and opening and market  economy, the traditional perceptions of Beijing women about  women's values and childbearing had undergone a great change,  with higher numbers wanting no children at all or only one  child. This group of young married women had the lowest  early-marriage percentage (0.3 percent), the highest percentage  of no children, and very few bearing two children, basically  achieving late marriage, late childbearing, and few births.  The lower childbearing level of women born from the 1960s on  resulted from the overall impact of childbearing policy and  socio-economic development.  <H5>  II. The Change in Childbearing Perceptions </H5> <H5>  1. The Change in Childbearing Perceptions From the </H5> Perspective of Childbearing Aspirations and the Real  Childbearing Difference    As used here, childbearing aspirations means, under set  socio-economic terms, and supposing no intervention by family  planning policy, the voluntary choices made by women as to the  number of children to bear and their sex.    As to the women born before 1949 and in the 1950s, the  childbearing aspirations to have no children, one child, or two  children were roughly the same. But the childbearing  perceptions of women born from the 1960s on underwent a marked  change, with the percentages of those wanting no children or  only one child up sharply, the percentage of those wanting two  children lower than for those born in both of the previous  periods, and not even one woman wanting a third child. As to  the overall childbearing aspirations of the 2,162 women  surveyed, the childbearing perceptions of Beijing's urban women  are undergoing a conversion from traditional to modern form,  with the numbers of women wanting less or no children growing  steadily. As to the sex preference, since having a boy is no  longer the key childbearing motivation of urban women, in the  childbearing aspirations of the women surveyed, regardless of  the child's sex, the percentage of women opting for only one  child was the highest. In the aspirations for one boy, one  girl, two boys, or two girls, more women wanted a girl than a  boy, exactly the opposite from the old, traditional childbearing  perception.  <H5>  2. The Change in Childbearing Perceptions from the Angle of </H5> the Childbearing Aspirations of Women Now Having Varying Numbers  of Children    The women who have not had children were basically born  since  the 1960s, with their childbearing aspirations for no children  at 28.4 percent, for one child at 43.2 percent, for two children  at 24.7 percent, and for three or more children basically  nonexistant. Of the women now having one child, 50.5 percent  have had their aspirations basically satisfied, while 40.3  percent would like a second child. Of women with two children,  50.4 percent have satisfied their childbearing aspirations, with  47.4 percent having real childbearing levels higher than they  had hoped for. As to women with three or more children, only a  very few had wanted this many, with 92.6 percent having more  children than they really wanted. [passage omitted]    The childbearing aspirations of the women now having two or  more children shows the obvious change in the childbearing  perceptions of Beijing's urban women. Most women with more  than one child were born before 1949. While their actual  number of children is higher than they had hoped for, their  childbearing aspirations were certainly not satisfied. As  childbearing perceptions have changed from the past multiple  births to less births, only one child, or no children, there is  a phenomenon of real childbearing levels being out of line with  aspired-to childbearing numbers. [passage omitted]  <H5>  3. The Change in Women's Childbearing Perceptions as to the </H5> Value of Children    The change in childbearing perceptions is restricted by many  factors, with the benefits playing a key role, being reflected  in many values about the children born. The survey  questionnaire categorized the value of children as follows: 1)  To keep you from being lonely; 2) to form a complete family; 3)  to bring happiness; 4) to help the family make a living; 5) to  avoid possible reproach for not wanting children; 6)  childbearing is a woman's duty; 7) raising children to take care  of one in their old age; 8) to please parents and relatives; 9)  to preserve conjugal relations; 10) to give you honor; 11) to  bring you love; 12) to pass on to future generations that  received from ancestors. The value of children is closely  linked to regional factors and economic conditions. Before  liberation and in the 1950s, Beijing was closed to international  intercourse, with very low living standards, where people often  emphasized the economic value of having children, generally  regarding the number of children born as a source of increased  family income, and seeing boys as future family pillars, support  in old age, and the "incense" of passing on to future  generations that received from ancestors. But as Beijing has  now become a modern, open city, with a relatively developed  economy, higher per capita income, and adults with more years of  schooling, it has experienced a qualitative leap from a social,  economic, or cultural perspective, with many of the perceptions  of Beijingers, including childbearing perceptions, having  naturally changed sharply. Even the women born before 1949  have essentially abandoned their backward, traditional  childbearing values and perceptions. In this survey, the two  values of children, of passing on the generations and raising  children to take care of one in their old age, ranked lowest of  all values, being replaced by the "family happiness" and "sense  of a complete family" of bearing children for the spiritual  benefits and forming a complete family, bringing love, keeping  one from being lonely, and bringing family pleasures. As the  family focus shifts from blood to matrimonial relations, with  children no longer being the "tie" that binds families together,  the phenomenon of young married women not wanting children is  growing steadily.    As educational levels differ, so do the values of women  about  having children. For instance, as to passing on the  generations, raising children to take care of one in their old  age, bringing honor to one's ancestors, and childbearing as a  woman's duty, women with grade school educations or less made up  the highest percentage at over 20 percent, with the percentages  for those with junior and senior high school eductions being  very low, at 3.4 percent and 4.6 percent respectively, and  college-educated women ranking lowest at only 2.3 percent. The  value perceptions of "family happiness" and "sense of a complete  family," such as holding that childbearing is to form a complete  family, bring family happiness, provide parents love, and keep  the family from being lonely, ranked high among women of all  educational levels.    As women's occupations vary, so do childbearing values and  perceptions. For instance, among women in the three higher  levels of occupation, such as professional technicians,  officials in state organs, party and mass organizations, and  enterprises and institutions; and office workers and related  personel, less women held old, traditional perceptions, such as  "passing on the generations, raising children to take care of  one in their old age, and childbearing as a woman's duty," than  in the three categories of business workers, service workers,  and production and transportation workers and related personnel,  with these values for the former three categories of women  ranking respectively at 4 percent, 6.3 percent, and 9.3 percent,  but for the latter at 12.6 percent, 15.2 percent, and 19.3  percent, respectively. The key values of "forming a complete  family, bringing happiness, providing love, and keeping one from  being lonely," ranked very high among women of all occupations.  <H5>  III. The Factors Affecting the Change in Women's Perceptions </H5> About Childbearing [passage omitted]  <H5>  1. Economic Factors Affecting the Change in Childbearing </H5> Perceptions    Economic factors are the most important ones promoting the  change in childbearing perceptions. In recent years, as  Beijing's economy has experienced impressive changes, the  economic status of women has correspondingly risen. Of the  married women from 20-54 years of age who we surveyed, the  employment rate topped 90 percent, with specialized technicians,  officials in state organs, Party and mass organizations, and  enterprises and institutions; and office workers and related  personnel, accounting for 47.7 percent of the workforce. Based  on state occupational classifications, as these three categories  of personnel are considered to be in high-level occupations,  such a high percentage of them in the workforce shows that  Beijing women have a higher economic status. As women have  higher economic status, they no longer emphasize the past  economic values of having children to take care of them in their  old age, or in hopes that they will help the family make a  living and earn money for family support, weakening their  perceptions about early marriage, early childbearing, multiple  births, and regarding men as superior to women, and  strengthening them about less births, eugenics, and better  educations, meaning that they generally make higher demands on  their childrens' quality, involving sharp increases in the costs  of educating and raising children. The monthly consumption in  Beijing today of a non-adult child equals or even exceeds that  of the monthly wages of a key family worker, with the younger  the child, the higher the cost. This "high" cost of raising a  child affects women's quality of life, with young and  middle-aged married women in Beijing having an increasing sense  of independence and money, and striving for personal freedom and  happiness, as well as for cultural lives and material benefits,  with correspondingly changed consumer perceptions. The survey  showed that Beijing women's consumption ranks by money spent in  descending order as "buying daily necessities, clothing,  cosmetics, and beauty and hair care products, and paying for  recreational consumption, such as restaurants, karaoke, dancing,  and health clubs," with tourism and human relationship costs  also accounting for quite a high percentage of their monthly  incomes. The cost of having a child, plus the monthly spending  of both husband and wife, leaves very little left over. Many  women, in the interests of easier and more comfortable lives,  are unwilling to sacrifice personal well-being and happiness for  the fetters of a tied-down life. So the numbers of women not  wanting children are growing steadily.  <H5>  2. Policy Factors Affecting the Change in Childbearing </H5> Perceptions    Population and family planning policies are hard-limitation  factors affecting childbearing perceptions. Our survey of  women's childbearing aspirations proves that many more women  have had a child than had wanted or hoped to, with the most  crucial factor in this being China's current family planning  policy. Of the women with one child, most are of the new  generation born and raised since the founding of the PRC who, on  one hand were less affected by traditional childbearing  perceptions and, on the other are better educated and have  improved economic conditions, so can more easily understand and  accept the state's childbearing policy, and can proceed from  national and nationality interests to conscientiously practice  family planning. Of the women born before 1949, there is a  sharp gap between their childbearing aspirations and actual  childbearing levels, a key cause of which is the impact of the  propaganda and indoctrination in state family planning policy.  <H5>  3. Social Factors Affecting the Change in Childbearing </H5> Perceptions    Changes in perceptions follow closely behind social change.  While most of the women born before 1949 still maintained the  customary women's image of "virtuous wife and good mother," the  tide of change, with the passing of time, change in social and  economic system, and opening of Beijing's doors, has sharply  shaken traditional women's values and childbearing perceptions.  The young and middle-aged married women born since the 1950s,  as to childbearing aspirations, increase in percentage by lower  age as to not wanting children or wanting only one child, no  longer focusing their time and energy on raising children, but  preferring rather to develop themselves and enhance their own  quality. By the mid-1980s, the intense competition formed by  reform and opening had brought worries and concerns to young and  middle-aged women, bringing many to understand that unless they  strengthened their sense of competition, improved their  educations, and pursued advanced technical studies, it would be  hard for them to cope with the risks brought to women's  employment by reform. ZHONGGUO FUNU BAO [CHINA WOMEN'S REPORT]  has directly surveyed its readers on how women see the risks and  challenges brought by reform. This survey shows that 73  percent of women feel that reform has brought more risk to  women's than men's jobs, which figure is 67 percent for young  and middle-aged women, and 73 percent for middle-aged women. And  in our survey in Beijing on marriage and the family, almost  all women held that as to promotion opportunities, men had more  chance of promotion than women. Due to the historical image of  the weak woman, it should be said that while the competitive  climate is equal, the competitive terms for men and women are  unequal, with the "priority" consideration of women at times of  cutbacks being nothing new. So the masses of women can only  face up to their historical disadvantage, by improving their own  quality, so that they can compete with men in an unequal social  environment. Educational level is a key inherent factor  affecting childbearing perceptions and their change. The years  and extent of education directly affect the rate and depth of  human understanding of things. Better educated women focus  their childbearing perceptions on less births, eugenics, and an  emphasis on their children's quality, instead of striving for  numbers. They have less sex bias, clearer childbearing  objectives, and more distinct pre-conception rational thought  and choice processes. Based on their own social environment,  they can conscientiously consider and correspondingly adjust  their childbearing behavior, to make it as consistent as  possible with national policy.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, March 30 (XINHUA) -- President Boris  Yeltsin today met with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown,  who arrived here on Monday [28 March] seeking greater access to  Russian markets.    The meeting was attended by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Vladimirovich Kozyrev, presidential aide Dmitriy Pyurikov and  U.S. Ambassador in Moscow Thomas Pickering, according to the  INTERFAX NEWS SERVICE.    On Tuesday, Brown met with Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin.    Chernomyrdin told Brown that some import tariffs would be  revised, mostly concerning previously agreed contracts whose  implementation may be affected by the government's plans for the  introduction of new import duties.    Chernomyrdin added that the import duties on leasing two  U.S.  Boeing planes and various technologies will also be liable for  revision.    And he revealed that large quantities of inferior foodstuffs  had been delivered to Russia, which has resulted in hundreds of  poisoning cases.    However, despite the change in tariffs Chernomyrdin called  on  foreign investors not to be afraid of the Russian market, as  there is potential for considerable, and beneficial, joint  activities.    He explained that Russia is prepared for foreign investors  to  operate in its market place and that supporting legislation was  being prepared.    The prime minister also discussed with Brown broader access  for Russian products to the West and said that Russia could  guarantee delivery. "The recent decision to allow a delivery of  Russian uranium to the United States was a breakthrough," he  added.    In reply Brown said that both the U.S. Government and the  country's private sector are keen to support Russian reforms,  but stressed that at the same time Russia should provide  legislation to protect potential investors and iron out tax and  tariff problems.    Brown's visit to Russia comes at a time when trade exchanges  between the two countries are expanding; U.S. exports to Russia  reached 3 billion U.S. dollars in 1993, 40 percent more than the  previous year, while last year U.S. imports from Russia grew by  262 percent to 1.7 billion dollars.    Nevertheless, U.S. investment in Russia is still relatively  very small, currently running at only one billion dollars. But  according to Brown the United States believes there is great  potential for increased capital investment, especially in the  oil and gas industry.    During his five-day stay in Moscow, Brown is expected to  sign  four trade documents with Russia.    They include regulations for setting up a committee on the  promotion of Russian-U.S. business cooperation, regulations for  the establishment of U.S. funded business centers, a joint  statement on bilateral trading relations, personnel training and  standardization, and an agreement on making U.S. medicines  available to the Russian market.</p>

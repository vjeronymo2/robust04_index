			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: TINKERBELL T-SHIRTS?  </P> <P> Steven Spielberg's long talked-about Peter Pan project is set to begin  production early next year -- as "Hook" -- with Dustin Hoffman as the dastardly  Capt. Hook, opposite Robin Williams as a grown-up Peter, and Spielberg  directing. At this writing, Julia Roberts is high on the list of possibles to  portray Tinkerbell.  </P> <P> We've also learned that the film, as now scripted by Nick Castle and John Hart,  will mix the classic with the contemporary. Williams' character -- a  stressed-out adult whose life takes a magical turn when he returns to his  childhood home -- will be introduced in the present, eventually being  transported to ageless Never-Never Land.  </P> <P> Among the other contemporary touches: The Lost Boys start out as street types  who ride skateboards and play basketball. The mermaids are on the voluptuous  side -- with one sporting turquoise lips and bright orange hair.  </P> <P> With such exploitable elements -- and Spielberg's tradition of licensing the  heck out of his movie characters -- can a merchandising windfall be far behind?  </P> <P> "You're too early," says Marvin Levy, spokesman for Spielberg's Amblin Ent.,  which is teamed on the project with distributor Tri-Star Pictures. "The  merchandising aspects of this film will not be that significant.  </P> <P> "You're not going to see 8 zillion things . . . we don't think." Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

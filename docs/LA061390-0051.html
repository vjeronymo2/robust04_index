			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTDOOR NOTES;  </P> <P> LAW GOES BEYOND BAN ON HUNTING MOUNTAIN LIONS  </P> <P> Proposition 117, the Wildlife Protection Act, doesn't merely ban the hunting of  mountain lions in California.  </P> <P> Terry Mansfield, the Department of Fish and Game's assistant division chief for  wildlife management, and DeWayne Johnston, chief of enforcement, say that the  law -- which went into effect upon approval June 5 -- also prohibits  Californians from hunting lions in any of the other 10 Western states where it  is legal and bringing their trophies back into the state.  </P> <P> "It would prohibit possession, unless you can prove the lion was in your  possession before June 6 of 1990," Mansfield said. "It would prevent you as a  hunter from going to Montana, killing a lion legally, and then bringing the  pelt, the carcass, whatever back into California.  </P> <P> "Obviously, (the proponents') intent was not only to stop lion hunting in  California but to stop California residents from hunting lions in any other  state."  </P> <P> The state's houndsmen -- hunters who use dogs to pursue game such as bears and  lions -- probably have seen the last of pursuit permits -- usually 85 to 120 a  year -- that allowed hunters to chase game with dogs, tree it but not kill it.  </P> <P> "Right now, a tight reading by the enforcement guys is that it would eliminate  the opportunity to use pursuit permits," Mansfield said.  </P> <P> Last year, after proposed lion seasons were thrown out by courts in 1987 and  '88, the Fish and Game Commission also lost its bear season, and the pursuit  permits increased to 447. For those houndsmen, apparently, the sport was not  the kill but the chase, although proponents of Proposition 117 were skeptical.  </P> <P> "I have my doubts that that's in fact what they do," said Gerald Meral, the  Sacramento lobbyist whose Planning and Conservation League sponsored the  initiative.  </P> <P> Said Mansfield: "We're taking steps to amend Section 265 (of the state's Fish  and Game Code) to conform with the initiative and delete the option for pursuit  permits.  </P> <P> "The interesting thing is, you've never been able to sell a mountain lion or  parts of mountain lions -- such as pelts -- in California. This initiative now  allows you to do it.  </P> <P> "It's a poorly worded section. The intent was (something else). But in essence,  it would allow lions and their parts to be sold if you could prove you had  (them) before June 6 of 1990."  </P> <P> Summer is still a week away, but don't tell anyone fishing off Santa Catalina  Island.  </P> <P> "Summer has kicked in, and the water's warmed up," said Ray Province of L.A.  Harbor Sportfishing.  </P> <P> Province said boats from the landing -- after an on-again-off-again spring --  have been doing well at the island all weekend, but the action really picked up  Monday.  </P> <P> The Shogun, with 39 passengers, had 14 yellowtail weighing up to 32 pounds, and  seven white sea bass to 38 pounds. The haul also included 410 barracuda and 250  calico bass.  </P> <P> The Top Gun had only seven anglers, who caught 25 yellowtail averaging 21  pounds, one white sea bass, 70 barracuda and 40 calico bass. Two of the white  sea bass taken Sunday aboard the Top Gun weighed more than 40 pounds. The Outer  Limits on Monday had 20 catch 15 yellowtail, five white sea bass, 102 barracuda  and 87 calico bass.  </P> <P> "It's the best fishing in many, many years," said Bobby Taft, skipper of the  Top Gun. "If you can (catch) squid (for bait) at Catalina, it's a guarantee  right now."  </P> <P> The Black Jack, out of Redondo Sportfishing, reported early Tuesday that its  passengers had already boated 30 yellowtail, 22 white sea bass and 150  barracuda.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, sportfishers out of San Diego are beginning to catch more and larger  yellowtail in California waters only 16 to 20 miles west of Point Loma.  </P> <P> On Monday, 21 passengers aboard Buzz Brizendine's Prowler caught 61 yellowtail  averaging close to 12 pounds. The Pacific Queen, fishing the same area,  reported 22 yellowtail for 12 passengers.  </P> <P> In previous weeks, most of the yellowtail had been taken 40 to 60 miles  southwest of San Diego and had averaged between six and eight pounds.  </P> <P> Hurricane Boris apparently did not adversely affect the fishing off southern  Baja California. Blue marlin and wahoo have moved into the area, and striped  marlin remain extremely active only eight to 10 miles off the arched rock  signifying land's end.  </P> <P> "We've had several blues in the 250- to 280-pound range, two over 500 and the  638-pounder," said Darrell Primrose of Tortuga Sportfishing. The 638-pounder  was caught Monday by Dale Poynter of Delano.  </P> <P> If anything, Boris served to pump warm water into the area. Water temperatures  are averaging between 80 and 82 degrees, Primrose said.  </P> <P> In the East Cape region, fishing remains excellent. Dan Perry and 12 friends  from Las Vegas spent two days' fishing from the fleet at Hotel Palmas De  Cortez. Their catch: seven blue marlin, 28 sailfish, 14 dorado, 10 yellowfin  tuna and one wahoo.  </P> <P> Briefly  </P> <P> Tag applications and regulation booklets for deer, bighorn sheep, elk and  antelope are available at sporting goods stores and Department of Fish and Game  offices in Southern California.  </P> <P> Applicants for X Zone and special deer, antelope, bighorn sheep and elk hunts  must file by June 25 to be eligible for the computerized, random selection of  assignments. Deer tags for A, B, D and Archery Only zones are available at  authorized outlets.  </P> <P> The San Diego Marlin Club's annual Just for the Halibut tournament, proceeds of  which will benefit the Wheelchair Regatta sponsored by the Silvergate Yacht  Club, will be held Saturday from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. Prizes will be awarded for  the largest halibut, and anglers can fish from Oceanside to Point Descanso. The  cost is $20 for adults, $7.50 for those 16 or younger. Information: (619)  225-1300.  </P></p>

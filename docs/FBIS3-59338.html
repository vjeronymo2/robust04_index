It is only by starting from  a study of the system, rules, policies, regulations, and  safeguards that we can acquire a deep knowledge of the causes of  corruption and perfect these things through deeper reform; it is  only in this way that we can accomplish dealing with both the  objective and its causes, implement comprehensive  administration, and fill in all the loopholes. There is no other  way out.  <H5>  "Financial Border" Existed Early On </H5>   The rapid economic development of Mainland China has  attracted the world's attention, but so has the expansion of  corruption in every industry and circle. So, investigating graft  and other anti-corruption work, and encouraging clear and honest  administration has become a major item on the Chinese  Government's agenda. The "lifeblood" of mainland economic  operations, the financial industry, has over 17,000 grass-roots  units, over 800,000 employees throughout urban and rural China,  controlling the currency circulation business of all units on  the China mainland. It is just because this industry is in such  an important and special position that on 16 January 1990  Premier Li Peng issued this warning at the National Bank  Presidents Conference concerning a group of cases of graft,  accepting bribes, and theft which had appeared in financial  circles. The Premier said that: "Information from every locality  shows that money worship is growing among some cadres and  employees on bank staffs... Some people inside the banks have  been corrupted by money, with frequent occurrences of graft,  theft, bribe-taking, and fund diversion. This kind of corruption  phenomenon deserves the strong attention of leaders at every  level. To push the anti-corruption struggle, they must adopt  efficient measures, conduct inspections, and deal with specific  cases, to expose a group of big and key cases..." This has been  going on for more than three years. The presidency of the  People's Bank of China was changed from Li Guixian [2621 6311  7639] to a concurrent appointment for Vice Premier Zhu Rongji;  during that time, has the unhealthy tendency of "financial  termites" been stopped efficiently? The answer is  disappointing. Although the leaders of the Chinese Government  have worried so much, issued repeated warnings at all sorts of  conferences, and urged them time and again with good intentions  to investigate graft and clean up corruption, still, at the  National Financial Order Reorganization Conference in July of  this year, it was authoritatively disclosed that the corruption  phenomenon of some persons in the bank system taking advantage  of the industry to embezzle public funds was still expanding,  and the case of the "silver dragon" was quite prominent, leading  to extreme public dissatisfaction. Therefore, high ranking  leaders in China have repeatedly ordered the launching of  another anti-corruption struggle in financial circles in 1993:  "We must determine to give considerable attention to making  major achievements," and "lead the anti-corruption struggle into  a deeper level."  <H5>  "Silver Dragon" Shows New Characteristics </H5>   If we say that in the earlier years the "thieves inside the  banks" had grafted or taken bribes amounting for the most part  to several thousand yuan, or several ten thousand yuan, while  under the affects of the "gold wind" of "seeking money" by every  possible means in society, it has now developed to several  hundred thousand, several million, and even up to the insane  degree of several ten million yuan, which shows that the  corruption problem inside Mainland China's banks has indeed  reached a degree more serious than ever before. A document  issued jointly by the Supreme People's Procuratorate of China  and The Central Discipline Inspection Committee disclosed that  in the past three years, 37 new cases of graft were discovered  and handled within the banking system, involving a total of 220  million yuan. For ordinary graft, bribe-taking, embezzlement of  several thousands or several ten thousands, however, is flowing  in an endless stream, and it is hard to count the total amount  of money involved. The People's Bank of China, the Industrial  and Commercial Bank, urban credit unions, rural credit unions,  and insurance companies of financial units--none of these have  been involved in cases of this kind. For some "silver dragons,"  their "fierce mouths," which are swallowing huge sums of the  nation's prosperity, tend to be bigger each passing year, and  the records they have created grow more shocking year by year.  In 1990 there were nine especially large cases of graft, with  embezzlement of over 5 million yuan. The biggest case was the  Huzhou Industrial and Commercial Bank's Fenyang graft case in  Zhejiang, with graft amounting to 5 million yuan; in 1991, it  rose to 12 cases, an increase of three cases over the year  before. This time the person with the "fierce mouth" was Guo  Tingfeng [6753 1694 1496]: In his graft case in Cangnan County  Agricultural Bank in Zhejiang, the graft amounted to 14.28  million yuan. In 1992, it rose to 15 cases, an increase of three  cases over the year before; this time, the "champion" was Xue  Genhe [5641 2704 0735] of the Haikou Municipal Industrial and  Commercial Bank, with a graft amount of 33.44 million yuan.  Compared to him, criminals of the past two years suddenly look  like "small wizards meeting big wizards."    The current problem is, while these especially big criminals  have been discovered or dealt with, there are still a  considerable number of banking corruption phenomena of wide  scope which have yet to be discovered. The perpetrators continue  to change their strategems, pursuing personal gain through their  authority, exchanging that authority for money, extorting money  by means of their authority, falsifying records for the benefit  of relatives or friends, embezzling to make themselves rich,  taking sales commissions which are highly duplicitous, and  engaging in corruption. Here are some examples:    First, under the rubric of invigorating the economy and  supporting enterprises which invigorate capital, those who  extort money have developed from operating underground to  semi-overt. Many mainland enterprises lack capital and have  to pay "labor fees" in the thousands, even tens of thousands of  yuan when banks conduct "inquiries"; this is then remitted into  the small treasuries of bank units, and is then distributed  underground under a collective title. In this way, time and time  again, units and their employees are tempted. A lot of "first to  be rich" employees of banks made more than 1,000 yuan a month  from various sources of income. No wonder a bank cadre told a  good friend privately that he "only need use a little authority,  and we needn't worry about lack of money."    Second, if benefits are not offered to those who want  to trade their authority for money, then they won't do business  with you. As a monopoly financial trader, such matters as  fixing project capital, giving loans, fund raising, collecting  and distributing foreign exchange, allocating circulating money,  issuing securities to the market, and discounting are all inside  its business scope. Since these units alone offer these  services, and no other agency, so they are sought out by  everyone. They charge for approving a document, and take "labor  fees" sales commissions for a signature, giving "information,"  and stamping documents. If you do not give some side benefits to  bank representatives, even though your business is completely  legal and your reasons are abundant, it is still hard to pass.  So, exchange of authority for money has continued to rise in  recent years. It has risen from asking for dishes or sending  cigarettes to accepting valuable securities and financial gift  cards, and has now risen to take thousands and tens of thousands  in cash. There is a great deal of anger in enterprise circles,  but they find it difficult to speak out.    Third, the covert occupations of extortion and  blackmail. With the development of the mainland economy in  recent years, there has been an expanded demand for capital  requirement from all sides, with a growing tendency to ask for  credit loans, short term rebate loans, and fund raising in which  banks serve as representatives. Once an enterprise is able to  get an amount of money, the banks then demand one-thousandth of  the amount in cash as a "service fee," which actually is a type  of disguised confiscation, with the excuse for collecting it as  so-called bank employee welfare. The mass of the people are  strongly dissatisfied with this kind of extortion activity.    Fourth, embezzlement of public funds for use in stock,  land, and real estate speculation. This is the most  outstanding phenomenon taking place in "trust investment  corporations" and "security services corporations" which are  attached to banks.    Fifth, investment in established companies, in the  attempt to make money in every way possible. In recent  years, there has been a "craze for engaging in business  nationally" on the Chinese mainland. This has also caused  confusion and disorientation among banking system cadres, who  feel "they can't be rich if they don't engage in business," and  it became their way to "pursue wealth." So, all over the  nation, banks have gone into operating all kinds of "companies"  and "centers" by using public funds; a lot of these suddenly  established companies got a "lucky open." Of these people who  "plunged into the sea," some are current cadres, some are  retired cadres, or even their relatives and children. They not  only get the wages due them, which are perfectly justified, but  they also obtain various "subsidies," "labor fees," or  "profits," which arouses jealousy among ordinary factory  employees. It is hard to determine the exact number of these  front companies, or just how many bank employees are involved  with them, even for high level leaders of the People's Bank of  China.  <H5>  "Inside Job" Thieves Tend To Be Younger </H5>   An upsetting trend is that criminals in mainland financial  circles tend to be younger. In the last five years, the mainland  bank business has developed rapidly, absorbing many young  workers who usually come to the bank through school allocation  or by social employment, filling their retired parents'  positions. They have not been subjected to strict examination,  training, or intensified education, so the quality of their  business and their work ethic is not satisfactory. The rapid  development of domestic and overseas financial business put some  of them in certain leadership positions early, while some of  them never worked as leaders before, and now undertake  independent work assignments in a particular department. In  addition, although they lack social experience and a work ethic,  they deal with money every day, just at the time "money worship"  is popular on the Chinese mainland. They always want to "be  wealthy first of all." It can be said that the greedy desire for  and pursuit of money are the most fundamental roots of increased  instances of corruption among young criminals in banks. Among  the 37 especially large cases mentioned above, over four-fifths  involved people less than 35 years old. The youngest one was  surnamed Jia [6328], a cashier at the International Trade Agency  of the Shenzhen Construction Bank, who when only 17 years old  grafted a total of more than US$27,000, HK$1.07 million, and  over 400,000 yuan. After the crime was discovered, the criminal  fled with this huge amount of money, and so far is still at  large. A cashier named Wu [0702], of the Rongqi Agency of the  Bank of China in Suide, Guangdong, only 26 years old, at one  time or another within a 40 day period stole over 500,000 yuan  RMB and HK$570,000, all of which went for gambling and leading a  life of debauchery. He was deserving of the term "big termite."  <H5>  Weak Laws and Regulations </H5>   Financial work is done by accepting deposits, extending  credit, and settling accounts; it does these things by means of  currency, account matters, and documents. What is involved are  such forms of hard currency as currency, gold, and foreign  exchange. It is therefore extremely important to establish  perfect laws and regulations, efficient administrative rules,  and a strong system of administration. What upsets people is  that in the mainland banking system, which should be very  strictly managed, such phenomena as rules violations, ignoring  instances of these violations, lax management, and weak  supervision are common occurrences, shortcomings which can be  exploited in many places. An example is an accountant named Xue  [5641] of the Dongfeng Agency of the Haikou Municipal Industrial  and Commercial Bank, who took advantage of leadership trust,  chaotic management in the industry, and a lack of strict rules  to swallow up 250,000 yuan through three blank drafts. Initial  success made him bolder, so he took advantage of his position in  checking receipts, and arranged for a sealed secret escort. Over  time, he stole more than 20 blank bank drafts, as well as the  associated bank seal which was kept by a colleague. He then gave  these bogus bank drafts to outside criminals allied with him, to  secure payments from over 20 banks in more than 10 provinces and  municipalities, ultimately grafting funds totalling 33.44  million yuan. A cashier named Gu [7357] was Section Chief of the  No 1 Business Department of the Fuyang branch of the Anhui  Industrial and Commercial Bank, who shared the privilege of  entering and exiting the treasury house at will; even the rule  "two people must be in charge of the treasury house," usually  absolute, was no restriction on him. After he acquired the bad  habit of gambling, he began thinking about the treasury house  and embezzled 7.70 million yuan. After the crime was discovered,  he said, very upset, "If the bank management were a bit more  strict, I couldn't have pulled it off so smoothly." So, we can  tell what degree of laxity exists in the mainland bank  management and supervision system.  <H5>  Corruption Developed in Relationship Network </H5>   Although there has been definite reform of the banking  personnel system on the mainland in recent years, and there has  been a start on publishing invitations for jobs; still,  director-level positions at the provincial, municipal, and  county level are still assigned by higher level authorities.  Many people have done everything they can to remain in this  "land of wealth" after becoming financial officers, installing  their children and good friends in banking positions. Even if  they have received a public invitation for a job, some people  make certain arrangements under the table to let their  relatives, friends, or children of their superiors get through  the financial gate smoothly. From this, they form a network of  authority and money which influences mutual benefits, a network  in which if one is injured, all will be injured; if one goes  boom, all will, so much of the graft and corruption cannot be  exposed and dealt with efficiently. When several banks in  Beijing, Guangzhou, and Baotou were looking into questionable  persons, they all received telephone calls on these people's  behalf, hinting that there might be consequences for the banks.  So, behind some cases, there is not only just the ethics problem  of crime itself; the bigger problem of the relationship network  of appointing people by favoritism also plays a role here, and  this has developed their recklessness.    Obviously, as the mainland is in a transitional period of  changing from a planned to a market economy, the supporting laws  and regulations are not perfected yet, some policies are not  correct, and there are many weak links and shortcomings in the  work. All these things give "bank termites" a host of  opportunities to exploit for their own advantages, and the  anti-corruption struggle is facing a new, more serious  situation. It is only by starting from a perfected system of  rules, policies, laws and regulations and preventative measures  that we can then learn the deep-rooted causes which produce  corruption. Then we can make it perfect through deeper reform,  dealing with both the cause and the effect, and reorganize  comprehensively to block all loopholes. There is no alternative.</p>

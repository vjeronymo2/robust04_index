			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Hasan Abu-Libdah, deputy director </F> general of PECDAR, by 'Umar Zaydani; place and date not given;  from the "With the Midday Events" program--recorded]    [Text] [Zaydani] Dr. Hasan Abu-Libdah, deputy director  general of the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and  Reconstruction [PECDAR]: You returned last night from Paris  carrying in your pocket $42 million from the donor states.    [Abu-Libdah] In fact, we did not come back with $42 million  in our pocket. We returned with commitments to pay an  additional $42 million to what was pledged on 27 January 1994.    [Zaydani] When will the donor states begin to transfer the  funds?    [Abu-Libdah] Some of them have already started to do this.  There is a sum of money in the Johan Jorgen Holst Peace Fund.  We expect additional funds to be transferred this month.    [Zaydani] During this month, how much will there be in the  Holst Fund?    [Abu-Libdah] We expect the funds to total $62 million.    [Zaydani] Is this the sum you have asked for?    [Abu-Libdah] It is part of what we have asked for. We went  to the Paris conference three days ago having in mind the need  to cover the $81 million deficit in the budget of the  Palestinian National Authority [PNA]. We had expected some  donor states to step forward to cover this deficit. We got $42  million, however.    [Abu-Libdah] Which states have so far contributed funds to  the PNA?    [Abu-Libdah] The big states. The United States has pledged  an additional $10 million; Japan an additional $9 million; Saudi  Arabia an additional $10 million; Norway an additional $2  million; Canada an additional 1 million Canadian dollars; in  addition to other states that will announce this. Let me  explain here that these sums are not new pledges; they are a  redistribution of the previous pledges. In 1994, many nations  pledged to pay more than $700 million. Of course, not all the  money will be disbursed in 1994. Based on discussions with these  nations, it was agreed that some of them will redistribute their  commitments so that we can cover the deficit.    [Zaydani] What are the priorities to which these funds will  go in the self-rule region?    [Abu-Libdah] The first priority, of course, is paying the  salaries in the public sector, in addition to a variety of  programs which we deem of priority. These programs will try to  respond to the requirements of the poorer sections of  Palestinian society.    [Zaydani] Will the funds then be transferred from the Holst  Fund to a particular Palestinian side, the PLO or another fund?    [Abu-Libdah] The Johan Holst Fund is run by the World Bank,  but it is at the disposal of the Palestinian leadership, which  will decide where to disburse any sums from this fund.    [Zaydani] Another question, if I may. These funds will be  enough for only several months.    [Abu-Libdah] Certainly. We went to the Paris conference,  and we will go to the next conference on 11 July to demand that  the deficit in the PNA budget be covered until the end of this  year. We think that if we manage to lay down the appropriate  mechanisms to collect Palestinian income in other ways, then we  will begin 1995, hopefully, with little or no deficit at all.    [Zaydani] How will the Palestinians contribute money to the  PNA through the collection of taxes from Palestinians abroad?    [Abu-Libdah] The Palestinians abroad are expected, in  general, to contribute a great deal to development and  reconstruction. Palestinian revenues inside the occupied  territories will definitely not be enough to lay the foundations  of true economic progress that will enable the private sector to  operate smoothly. Therefore, we expect our Palestinian brothers  outside the occupied territories to be the way we know them, to  invest their funds in the self-rule region and pledge funds to  allow for progress in economic reconstruction in general.    [Zaydani] PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat has made his travel to  Jericho conditional on receiving aid from the donor countries.  Has Yasir 'Arafat dropped this demand?    [Abu-Libdah] Brother Yasir 'Arafat knows best under what  conditions he will be able to enter his country. However, I  believe that brother Yasir 'Arafat will arrive shortly in  Jericho.    [Zaydani] Why this secrecy about his arrival in Jericho?    [Abu-Libdah] There are several factors that will determine  the date of his arrival in Jericho, some of which have to do  with the arrangements for the transfer of the PLO offices and  its commitments inside the occupied territories, and some of  them have a direct relation to the political situation in  general.    [Zaydani] Dr. Hasan Abu-Libdah, thank you very much.    [Abu-Libdah] You are welcome.</p>

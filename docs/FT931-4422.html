			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Electricity group to boost gas sales to industry MANWEB, the regional electricity supplier for Merseyside and North Wales, yesterday signed a new contract to quadruple its sales of gas to industry and commerce. Manweb and East Midlands Electricity have been test-marketing supplies from Alliance Gas, a joint venture between British Petroleum, Statoil of Norway and Norsk Hydro. Manweb yesterday signed a contract with Alliance to take up to Pounds 50m of gas over the next three years. Alliance yesterday said it would buy gas from the Viking field, about 70 miles off the Lincolnshire coast in the southern half of the North Sea. It is taking half the field's production from BP Exploration, which has equal shares in the field with Conoco, the operator. East Midlands is talking to Alliance about extending its experimental deal, while Alliance is also pushing ahead with direct sales to industry. Mr Kris Maroe, Alliance Gas's managing director, yesterday forecast total sales of Pounds 100m a year by December. Domestic sales are not yet open to competition, but Manweb said it was confident it could become 'a major player' should British Gas's monopoly end. Manweb's gas customers include Marks and Spencer Financial Services, based in Cheshire; Chester and Liverpool city councils; Greater Manchester Police and ICI Runcorn. Initial contact was through electricity sales liaison staff who passed leads to gas specialists, the number of whom is to increase from three to five. Some sales are in the south of England to branches of national companies based in the north-west. Manweb pays British Gas for use of pipelines, the fee taking into account the distance pumped and maintenance, although the gas involved comes from a common supply into which British Gas and independent suppliers feed. Alliance's gas comes from the North Sea, but Manweb has also been able to bid successfully at auction for some excess British Gas supplies from its Morecambe Bay field, cutting distribution costs to north-west customers.</p>

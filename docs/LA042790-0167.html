			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THANK YOU FOR NOT BASHING CHRISTIANS  </P> <P> Bravo! Bravo! There's been so many nasty things said recently about religion,  Christianity in particular.  </P> <P> Some deserved, some not deserved. I was pleasantly shocked by Susan Christian's  piece "The Last Temptation" (April 5). It was good, fair journalism. No  Christian bashing. I almost fainted.  </P> <P> I, for one, am glad the Church is offering these services to the gay community.  After all, it's terribly convenient to donate a few bucks to the (AIDS) cause,  sit back, put your feet up and blame God by assuming that homosexuals don't  want any help . . . and couldn't change even if they did. Some folks call it a  cop-out.  </P> <P> Thanks again (Susan and The Times), and give us more.  </P> <P> Wiley B. Burnes,  </P> <P> Westminster  </P></p>

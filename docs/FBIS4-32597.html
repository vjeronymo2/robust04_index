			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Changes in Road Traffic With Albania"] </F>   [Text] Starting 1 July, the traffic between Albania and  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  will be facilitated -- drivers will only be required transport  licenses. This was agreed on in Ohrid, during the recent  meeting between road traffic experts of the Albanian Ministry  for Transport and Communication and the Macedonian Ministry of  City Planning, Construction, Traffic, and Ecology. All  Macedonian transporting firms will be exempted from paying road  taxes and tolls. The first contingent of 5,000 transportation  licenses, bilateral and transit, as well as 100 licenses for  transportation to and from third countries, is already being  distributed.    At the Ohrid meeting, the two sides also signed a draft  agreement on international transport of passengers and goods  through both countries. The agreement was signed in Albanian,  Macedonian, and English. The Albanian side, however, had  remarks on the name of Republic of Macedonia being used in the  text, so they introduced a special clause on the agreement  coming into effect after the additional consultations on the  problem.</p>

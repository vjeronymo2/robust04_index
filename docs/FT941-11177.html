			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / International Company News: Volvo dismisses suggestions of a Saab alliance Volvo, the Swedish motor manufacturer, has brushed off suggestions from its domestic rival Saab Automobile that the two companies should discuss co-operation following the collapse of Volvo's plans to merge with France's Renault. 'It is not on the agenda at all,' Volvo said yesterday. Saab's British chief executive, Mr Keith Butler-Wheelhouse, last month said he was open for discussion on common development and production of car components. He said he had spoken to Mr Lennart Jeansson, a top Volvo executive, about the possibility of working together 'on a range of things'. Mr Jeansson acknowledged this week that Volvo and Saab - which is jointly owned by General Motors of the US and Sweden's Saab-Scania - already co-operated through their use of a number of common Swedish subcontractors. However, he said there was 'not much' potential for extending this. He suggested any project offering real cost savings would mean Volvo and Saab models would have to be made in the same plant, and this was unrealistic. Mr Jeansson drove home his point with a mixed, but apposite, metaphor referring to a failed attempt at co-operation in the 1970s. 'Saab left us on the church steps. Since then so much has happened. Now the train has gone,' he told a seminar of business students in Stockholm. Volvo shares fell back sharply in Stockholm yesterday, after a week in which they had surged on news that Renault had sold more than half of its 8.27 per cent stake in its Swedish partner. Swedish investors, seeing returns from a once-again profitable Volvo enhanced by the unravelling of its ties to Renault, have pushed up Volvo shares by some 70 per cent since the merger plan was torn up in December. However, the heavily-traded Volvo B shares slipped SKr15 yesterday to close at SKr678, well below the week's high point of more than SKr700.</p>

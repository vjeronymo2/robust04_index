			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by K. A. Bezhanov and A. M. Ter-Krikorov, Moscow </F> Physical Technical Institute; UDC 532.593:551.466.4]    [Abstract] Disturbances introduced into a multilayer flow  of an ideal incompressible heavy fluid by a point source are  examined. The fluid has a finite number of layers and an  arbitrary velocity and density distribution in each layer, but  in the case of a fluid of finite depth it is assumed that the  lower infinitely deep layer has a constant velocity and density.  The field of disturbances is represented in the form of a double  integral of the Green's function of the auxiliary spectral  problem for an ordinary differential equation dependent on two  complex parameters. In the case of a fluid of finite depth the  properties of the discrete spectrum of this problem make it  possible to represent wave and nonwave disturbances in the form  of a series of single integrals. In the case of a fluid of  infinite depth the properties of the discrete and continuous  spectra of the auxiliary spectral problem make it possible, by  virtue of the smallness of the stratification parameter, to  represent the field of disturbances in the form of wave  disturbances having the form of an infinite sum of the single  integrals and nonwave disturbances in the form of a double  integral. The special case of two layers of a constant density  with an infinitely deep lower layer is investigated. References  18: 17 Russian, 1 Western.</p>

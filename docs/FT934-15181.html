			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Leading Article: An attack on the voluntary sector ORGANISATIONS IN Britain's voluntary sector now play an important part in the delivery of a wide range of public services. In health, social services, housing and education, charities compete with public bodies, quangos and private companies to provide essential services. Some are now big players in the internal markets which have been established throughout the public services. A report published yesterday by the Home Office suggests that providing public services undermines charities' claims to a distinctive role in society. It argues that those which take the government's shilling are no longer voluntary organisations, and have surrendered their independence and freedom to campaign. If they want to earn money by providing services, the report concludes, they should lose their charitable status, together with the tax reliefs that go with it. Certainly the role of charities is changing in the new social market economy. Yet charities which provide public services are arguably doing nothing more than returning to the principles of their founders. Before the arrival of the welfare state, many social services were provided by voluntary bodies such as Barnardos and the Children's Society. Charities' return to these tasks reflects a growing understanding that the welfare state cannot satisfy all the demands of society. Powerful lever The big difference is that today's services are largely paid for by taxpayers' money. Before the welfare state, it was charitable donations that provided the income. Accepting public service contracts inevitably constrains a charity's ability to criticise the paymaster openly. But it offers the opportunity to influence government decisions from within. And the threat to withdraw noisily from public service contracts because of unacceptable policy decisions can be a powerful lever of persuasion. The Home Office report suggests that campaigning work should be divorced from service provision. This might be a sensible choice for charities which find government contracts inhibiting their freedom to challenge the social order. But to prescribe this divorce for all charities would be to sacrifice an important link between campaigning activities and charities' ability to provide services. It is often the campaigning of the charity which makes people willing to work voluntarily or less expensively for it in the first place. Indeed, it is precisely their ability to mobilise volunteers and augment taxpayers' money with charitable donations that makes charities such valuable organisations. As life expectancy increases, there will be a growing demand for the personal care services. Willingness to fund such services through taxes is unlikely to rise commensurately. Expanding the input of volunteers will be essential in meeting the demand. Community's benefit This is something which charities are well placed to organise. In an increasingly wealthy society, paid work is often unnecessary for people who have taken early retirement or left employment for family reasons. Charitable organisations offer such people an opportunity to use their skills for the community's benefit. Volunteering also offers much to those who are involuntarily outside employment. The government has run several schemes that encourage unemployed people to become involved in community projects. Apart from the social benefits, these schemes encourage their participants to maintain their work skills and remain in contact with the world of work. So long as it is not simply a question of displacing jobs from one employer to another, more could be done to encourage voluntary work in return for benefits. The Home Office report raises valid questions about the purpose of charities and their role in society. But in proposing that charities receive rewards for good contractual performance rather than by virtue of their charitable status, it would risk turning charities into little more than government agencies. The best charities are innovative, flexible and cost-effective. The tax benefits of charitable status and the risk of the odd subsidised broadside are an acceptable price to pay for such an asset.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Howard favours 'green' taxes TAXES AND permits head a list of 441 new measures to improve the environment in the government's second annual progress report on its 'green' policies. The report, published on the second anniversary of the white paper This Common Inheritance, lists the progress - or lack of it - on more than 440 environmental commitments. Mr Chris Smith, Labour environment spokesman, attacked the document as 'appallingly self-congratulatory' and joined environmental groups in criticising its failure to integrate transport and energy policies with green issues. Presenting the report Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said: 'I have a general preference for economic instruments where they work more effectively than regulation'. Among possible new tools, the government is considering higher fuel prices, road pricing, tradable permits for industrial emissions and a carbon tax. Mr Howard acknowledged that no date had been set for the start of any of those. Road pricing proposals would have to wait for a Department of Transport study, to be published in a year at the earliest. The report - which follows statements from Mr Howard on the importance of stricter enforcement of EC regulation - spells out several important delays and failures in government policies. They include: A year's likely delay in publishing the review of renewable energy strategy, due in spring 1992. More than a year's likely delay in publishing a strategy for nuclear research, due in late 1991. Failure of most local authorities to publish recycling plans by August 1992. Failure to introduce regulation on genetically modified organisms, due May in 1992. The 441 new proposals include: New air quality standards to reduce ground-level ozone, benzene and carbon monoxide to be set by 1993, and for sulphur dioxide and butadience by 1994. New water quality standards to be introduced next year. New standards for waste sites from 1993. This Common Inheritance - The Second Year Report. HMSO. Pounds 21.</p>

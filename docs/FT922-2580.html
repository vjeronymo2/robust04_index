			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Lloyd's ready to share premises LLOYD'S of London is prepared to allow insurance companies to share its premises, paving the way for growing links between it and the conventional market. Discussions have taken place between Mr Dick Hazell, deputy chairman of Lloyd's, and Anglo American, an independent London-based insurer, about a possible move. Anglo-American said no decision had been taken. Mr Hazell said he hoped to attract other insurance companies. In a separate development it has emerged that final figures for the 1989 losses of syndicates managed by the Gooda Walker agency may not be available until next week. The Gooda losses, which stem from spiral reinsurance - in which syndicates and insurers reinsure each other's large-scale catastrophe exposure - could amount to more than Pounds 500m. That would be about a quarter of the market's overall loss of about Pounds 2bn which Lloyd's will announce at its annual meeting on June 24. The premises talks take place as a Lloyd's committee starts detailed examination of how corporate limited liability capital can be provided to Lloyd's syndicates, where Names - the individuals whose assets provide the market's capital - have unlimited liability for insurance losses. Lloyd's is also keen to increase rental income following a fall in the number of syndicates at the market. More than 120 have either closed or merged in the past 18 months, leaving one of the four underwriting floors vacant and another under-occupied. The Baltic Exchange, the marine cargo market whose headquarters were destroyed by an IRA bomb attack in April, is temporarily occu-pying part of this floor at Lloyd's. Insurance companies rented offices at Lloyd's previous headquarters in Lime Street. A case brought by 91 members of Lloyd's of London against Lloyd's syndicates has been dismissed by a US District Court Judge.</p>

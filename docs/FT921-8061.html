			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Arts: Collins and Johnson - two young British clarinet virtuosos There are many thousands of people who go often to orchestral concerts, and sometimes to solo recitals by singers, pianists and even violinists, but would never think of going to hear a mere clarinet or oboe with piano. They are misguided. True, there are not many solo masterpieces in the repertoire of either instrument - an 'adventurous' programme is almost inevitably an excursion into dusty material (however amiable and fluent) or avant-garde pieces (often grimly un-fluent); but there are quite a few master players, and when they strut their best stuff the result can be as rewarding as any Liederabend. Thus Michael Collins' clarinet recital on Monday at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, with the supererogatory bonus of Mikhail Pletnev as virtuoso accompanist. Though they drew a good house, amongst whom there were doubtless a hundred young clarinettists or more, it was sad to think how many more listeners would have been delighted if they'd found themselves there. Collins is one of the best players in the world, and his programme included about half of the first-rank music for his instrument with piano: Schumann's op. 73 Fantaisiestucke, the Poulenc sonata, one of the two op. 120 Brahmses and the Debussy 'Premiere Rhapsodie'. There was never a 'Deuxieme', and one more recital could finish off all the major works - the other Brahms sonata, the Hindemith, and Stravinsky's three unaccompanied pieces; after that it is down to minor German Romantics, minor Frenchmen and Edwardians in thrall to Brahms. Though a clarinet cannot sing words, Collins phrases, articulates and colours like a great Liedersanger; and of course the instrument enjoys the extra-vocal possibilities of brilliant tongue-and-finger routines, and of the riches of sonata form. He does not go in for visionary, disembodied effects like Richard Stoltzmann - the Collins clarinet is always a resonant wooden thing which transmits a live, intelligent voice; but his elegantly orthodox manner leaves room for a sharp sense of humour, a constant threat of cheerful subversion, that we've missed since Gervase de Peyer decamped to America. Collins and Pletnev were marvellous in their Poulenc, switching between the deliberate extremes of feeling, operatic flurries and wry reflection, without batting an eye. Their Debussy was exquisite. I have not heard Lutoslawski's '5 Dance Preludes' rendered in such vivid contrasts, nor so searchingly. In Brahms and Schumann they were coolly admirable, but slightly thin-blooded in effect: with piano lid half closed, Pletnev was too solicitous for his partner to allow the piano textures their full warmth. After the interval the piano was flung open, and their exuberant Poulenc and Lutoslawski were followed by Weber's irresistibly glitzy Grand Duo and an extravagant Andre Messager morceau de concours as encore. Hugely enjoyable, and twinkling with musical insights - ironic, sentimental, knowing. I should add that for Collins, Pletnev is a partner in a million: not only does he match his inflections to an ESP nicety, but somehow they even echo each other's timbres. In the Barbican Hall on Monday there was another brilliant young English clarinet virtuoso, Emma Johnson, keeping company with the English Chamber Orchestra under Sian Edwards, and playing the concerto she had commissioned from Michael Berkeley for the Huddersfield Festival last November. This very striking piece, much more sinewy in idiom, tougher in subject matter and tauter in unfolding than we have come to expect from Berkeley's pen, concerns itself with the double aspect of childhood, its terrors and enchantments - the composer is currently at work on a Kipling opera with such a theme, for which the concerto is apparently a study-piece. It begins with a dry rattle on the timpani and a sort of stuttering on the clarinet. Both of these textural devices aptly presage the ferocious struggles and sorties undertaken between soloist and chamber orchestra in the first half. The abrasive sound-world thus conjured up often drives the clarinet to hard, bright squeals in the top register; the drama is delivered in a language that is at once harshly non-tonal and vividly gestural - even if one fails to fathom the purpose of its every twist or turn, one can hardly miss the urgency of its expressive import. Towards the end a more peaceable, though not exactly easy, relationship is established between the various forces. Miss Johnson attacked the concerto with authority, vigour, and grace, giving no quarter in battle, capable of sudden secretive lyricism; it is a work she plainly relishes, and the ECO apparently do likewise. It formed part of an exceptionally rewarding programme: alongside Berkeley there were David Matthews, Bartok and a new piece, The Light Fantastic, by the English Satie, Howard Skempton, that afforded 15 minutes of delicate delight. In it Skempton weaves perfectly shaped spiralling patterns all the more captivating for being couched in such modest terms. Miss Edwards seemed to me not yet entirely in command of its gossamer textures; similarly, I felt that she had not yet sunk herself fully into the substance of Weill's Second Symphony, which closed the concert, and through which the ECO were encouraged to drive with excessive forthrightness. This great, crazily neglected work is a pure and noble descendant of the 'classical', chamber-musical Mahler; it requires flexibility as well as forcefulness, and close characterisation of its bittersweet detail. Still, the overall impact of the symphony was undeniably powerful; and the conductor earned the passionate gratitude of at least one Weillian in the hall for reviving it at all.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with CP leader Ferdi Hartzenberg in Johannesburg </F> and Freedom Front leader General Constand Viljoen in Cape Town  by announcer Freek Robinson on the "Agenda" program -- live]    [Text] [Robinson] With me here in the studio is  Conservative Party [CP] leader Ferdi Hartzenberg and, in our  parliamentary studio in Cape Town, Freedom Front leader General  Constand Viljoen. Good evening to both of you. Dr. Hartzenberg,  if I could start with you, what exactly is your objection to the  Volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] Council?    [Hartzenberg] Good evening, Freek. I think we have to look  first at what our ideal is -- our objective, our mission. What  are we striving for? Let me sum it up like this: The Afrikaner  nation may be the nation with the strongest desire for freedom  in the world -- not at the cost of others, but to be itself, to  be free in its own fatherland, to coexist and live in harmony  with other nations in South Africa -- in other words, to have  political sovereignty, to have its own territorial security, and  to be able to work with all other nations economically and in  all other spheres. Our objection to the Volkstaat Council is  both the constitution and the accord; these limit the Volkstaat  Council and exclude that possibility because....    [Robinson, interrupting] I'm not sure about that. In any  case, I have that constitutional principle here before me, and I  can't see those aspects being excluded, perhaps not exactly in  the way that you would want. So perhaps you must define exactly  how you want it.    [Hartzenberg] I say, a sovereign state....[pauses] We also  made proposals at Kempton Park, where we proposed that there  should be a confederal order in South Africa so that those  nations that want full self-determination can get it, and others  that want other forms can also get them, so that all can  cooperate in a confederation. But we want political  sovereignty, and economic and other forms of cooperation. The  constitutional principle there is one of 34. All the other 33  constitutional principles are compulsory. They stipulate that  this and that will be like this. The very first one says South  Africa must be one single sovereign state. In other words, that  principle already excludes self-determination in the context  that we want it -- complete freedom. It excludes that. That  same constitutional principle also says that while South  Africa's population as a whole must have self-determination,  there can also be self-determination for any community or nation.    [Robinson] That does not rule out the possibility that on  the  basis of culture and language there could very well be a region,  whether inside South Africa or in any other recognized way --  another recognized way....    [Hartzenberg, interrupting] The point is, that region and  that self-determination -- the farthest you can go with it is to  create a 10th province, in other words, a province which will  not have complete freedom and complete self-determination. It  will still be under a central government with a tremendous  amount of power, which will determine the education policy and  the economic policy; which will dominate in all aspects; in  other words, that is the most you can get.    [Robinson] Did you discuss that with President Mandela when  you saw him on the three occasions; and does he agree with the  fact that there is no way possible for you to establish an  independent state?    [Hartzenberg] I discussed this thing with President Mandela,  even long before the election, and he knows exactly what are the  aspirations of our nation. The example which I cited is: If the  Swazi people can be free and independent, and can live with  everybody in South Africa in harmony and cooperation, then it is  also a right to which the Afrikaner nation is entitled.    [Robinson] What was his reaction?    [Hartzenberg] He said he understands what we mean. But you  have heard that several speakers in the ANC say no  self-determination, no volkstaat for the Afrikaner, and that is  exactly the problem. And that is why we did not support that  constitutional principle in Parliament, as it does not make  provision for full freedom and self- determination. That is why  we did not sign the accord; that is why we did not participate  in the election.    [Robinson] Can we just ask General Viljoen in Cape Town --  do  you also see this principle and the Volkstaat Council's function  limited, as Dr. Hartzenberg sees it, that you do not have the  option -- even if you wanted -- to have an independent state?    [Viljoen] I want to start by differing with you, Freek, when  you said that there was a deep-rooted difference of opinion. I  think there are only differences regarding the way to achieve  it, but what Dr. Hartzenberg has just explained about the  striving for freedom, I agree with that. The striving for  freedom is something that we all agree on, and the ultimate  objective that we are striving for is definitely also the same.  I personally did negotiate, and I tried several times to.  There is probably nobody else who tried harder to negotiate for  a more positive constitutional principle than number 34. We  would very much have liked this principle, as Dr. Hartzenberg  also mentioned....[pauses] Now we come to the question: Is it  still relevant or not? The fact is, as I see it, that the only  way -- other than war -- that one can pursue to get a volkstaat  is to use the constitutionally-provided system for that purpose.    [Robinson] I understand that, General. But can we clarify  this point? Do you believe that this principle is so limiting  that you cannot really become fully independent, even if you  wanted to?    [Viljoen] I think the difference between this principle and  the previous ones lies in the fact that the previous ones all  dealt with negotiated aspects, formulated, and that is why they  use the word "will." Because -- in the limited time that we had  available -- we could not finalize this issue of a volkstaat  concept through negotiations with the different parties, the  word "will" was not used, but instead the word "can." If we can  reach such an agreement, I believe it is quite possible to be  able to resolve this matter. The council says very clearly that  different forms of self- determination -- and in my opinion that  does not exclude the full negotiated approval of all the various  parties....    [Robinson, interrupting] But what is your personal point of  view? Reading between the lines, it seems you are not  personally in favor of a totally independent homeland?    [Viljoen] I wouldn't put it that way. Let's look at the  economy. A totally independent homeland would imply that you  would also be economically independent. And what about foreign  affairs? In our talks with the ANC, we have discussed the issue,  and even when we were still in the National Front, we felt that  foreign affairs was a function which the homeland would most  probably delegate to the central government. So in these two  areas it becomes clear that it would be very difficult to create  such a fully independent homeland immediately. If there was an  area in South Africa where it was obvious that we had a  majority, where it was almost a mere formality to draw borders,  it would be easy. But we still have to form a homeland, and it  will depend on the Afrikaners themselves, so it may be necessary  to promote their independent homeland in phases. That is why it  is important to me that we now stand together to try to get  started on these phases.    [Robinson] Your response, Dr. Hartzenberg?    [Hartzenberg] Freek, I also believe that we may achieve our  freedom in stages, and not in our first attempt. But what is  important is that one should not accept the first phase as the  final phase and then enter into agreements which bind one to  decisions taken, and surrender the right to eventual sovereignty.    [Robinson] It seems that the difference between you and Gen.  Viljoen is that you stand firm on the issue of an independent  state.    [Hartzenberg] Look, that is our goal and we will not rest  until we have achieved it. I am not prepared to surrender that  goal. The Palestinians have now reached a settlement with the  Israelis, but they do not have full sovereignty. They accept  the settlement; they say it is not their final goal, but that  they will press on. The unfortunate thing in our case is that  the agreements and the constitution say the Volkstaat Council  can undertake research and gather information and give advise,  but that the Constitutional Assembly will make the final  decision. It is the same as if you and I agree to a sale, and  agree that when I have bought the article, I will decide what  price to pay. If I then offer to pay you one cent for the  article, you will not be able to claim that you were depending  on my being reasonable. You will have to accept what we agreed  upon. That is why we say if we bind ourselves to these  agreements under the constitution, we will leave the right to  sovereignty in the hands of the ANC or whoever is governing this  country. We say we will never surrender the ideal of a free  Afrikaner nation living in harmony with other nations. There  will be no solution in South Africa unless the various nations  have been accommodated according to their wishes.    [Robinson] Dr. Hartzenberg, you have established a People's  Republic Committee. One assumes that the goal of the committee  is the same as that of the Volkstaat Council, except that  independence must come first?    [Hartzenberg] The function of the Republic Working Committee  is to make recommendations, investigate, determine strategies in  the constitutional, economic, social, security, education, local  government, and other areas, and begin with the practical  implementation of certain strategies; and to continue until we  achieve our goal of a free Afrikaner nation in a free republic.    [Robinson] It seems logical to me that one would expect this  committee of yours and the Volkstaat Council to liaise in some  way.    [Hartzenberg] We would want that to be supplementary. We  will have to ensure that our relationship is not  confrontational. What is important is that we are operating  outside the parliamentary system, and we have an important  function to carry out. Remember, the ANC had never been in the  parliamentary system. They only entered the parliamentary  system when they took power. For years the Democratic Party  [DP] propagated certain things, but they came nowhere, achieved  nothing, until Dr. Van Zyl Slabbert and Alex Boraine left the  system and started operating from outside. And they achieved  more than the DP had intended....    [Robinson, interrupting] But there was also the matter of  violence, and you said so in public.    [Hartzenberg] No, no. It is for that reason that, on the day  after the inauguration of the state president, I called his  office and asked for a meeting, because I believe it is possible  to resolve this issue without violence.    [Robinson] Gen. Viljoen, how do you think these two  committees or councils will liaise? How will they work together?    [Viljoen] Let me begin by saying that the achievement of our  ideal of a homeland, of self-determination for the Afrikaner  within a homeland, is a matter so closely linked to the future  constitution of South Africa that the two cannot easily be  separated. Afrikaners should realize that while we are one  nation, we have three fairly large parties, and then there are  many more smaller parties. So we have to find a mechanism which  will allow us to speak with a single voice on the issue of  self-determination. If we cannot get that right, we have big  problems. We must establish a nonpolitical body. I believe the  various political parties should now remain in the background so  that we can forget about the contentious political issues and  continue with the scientific aspects, the feasibility of the  homeland.    [Robinson] But there are two bodies, General. How are they  going to be reconciled with each other?    [Viljoen] No, no, I will come to that. In my opinion this  means that we should use the Volkstaat Council as such a body.  It is up to the Volkstaat Council to make scientific studies and  to present the whole matter. Then from the political side -- I  have recently made such a proposition to Dr. Hartzenberg -- we  can form a political plenary committee from among the different  parties. These ideas, as they are developed by the Volkstaat  Council, will be analyzed and will give direction.    [Robinson] Doctor, what do you say about that?    [Hartzenberg] Freek, the Volkstaat Council has this  limitation: It is limited by the constitution and accords to  only get as far as a province. And we must be satisfied with  that, because if we do not accept it, then we must break the  contract. Then we will be taken to court, and the court will  find the constitutional body to be right: We have accepted and  signed a contract, a contract which we would be breaking. We  would then be defying a court decision. If those limitations  were eliminated and the Volkstaat Council given an open agenda  -- so that it could go as far as full sovereignty -- then we  would consider the thing. At the moment, however, the Volkstaat  Council is limited. It cannot go past a 10th province, which  will be just like the other provinces.    [Robinson] Now what are you going to do in the future?    [Hartzenberg] Through our national Republic Working  Committee  we are going to negotiate....    [Robinson, interrupting] With the government?    [Hartzenberg] I have discussed the matter with the state  president. We are going to make proposals. We are going to make  it known in an agenda -- if you will give us that chance -- on  all fronts....    [Robinson, interrupting] Directly to him, not through the  Volkstaat Council?    [Hartzenberg] No, because if we go through the Volkstaat  Council, then we accept the limitations that we can only go as  far as a province, and our point of departure is: Everybody  must know -- including the ANC and the whole world -- our  ultimate goal is and remains sovereignty, and if we achieve  something along the way, then it will only be a step. It will  not be left in the hands of the constitutional body to finally  decide on our behalf. If they give us something, we will decide  whether that brings us closer to our goal. But we will not  abandon out goal along the way.    [Robinson] In conclusion, General Viljoen, just briefly on  one issue we have not yet touched: Should there be another form  of voting just to determine whether there is going to be a  homeland?    [Viljoen] The interesting part is this -- as I have just  said  -- we have three fairly big parties. Let us say the proven  support at the moment of 640,000 on the provincial level for the  Freedom Front is sufficient proven support. If one should add  to that the stayaway votes of the Conservative Party, then it  becomes majority support, and if we further accept....    [Robinson, interrupting] But that support has to be  demonstrated.    [Viljoen] But that is the problem. At the moment 640,000 is  already sufficient proven support. The point I am making is  that if one considers that there are also others, and if one  considers that within the National Party there is considerable  enthusiasm for the same idea at the grassroots level, then we do  not only have proven support but majority support. But what is  very important, Freek -- something that we have to realize -- is  that there are no limitations on the goal of a homeland. The  limitations apply only to the process of negotiation. But then  such constitutional limitations will be exactly the same as when  one works directly with the ANC. Whether you are negotiating  inside or outside Parliament, the limitations -- if there are  any, and I don't think there are -- will be the same.    [Robinson] Thank you very much, General. Thank you, Dr.  Ferdi Hartzenberg. It seems there will still be some wrestling  in the future to solve this problem. Thank you for your  participation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Professor Georgiy Pelisov: "The Metamorphosis </F> of the United Nations"]    [Text] Moscow -- The world public is alarmed by the  tragedy in Sarajevo. U.S. President Bill Clinton is angry, UN  Secretary General Butrus-Ghali is indignant, and NATO is poised  to put warplanes into the air. The real culprit has not been  found but it is planned to punish the Serbs just as a warning,  as it were.    You can understand the world public, and Bill Clinton, and  Butrus-Ghali. The death of completely innocent people is, of  course, an outrage and demands retribution, but only against  those who are guilty of this crime against humanity. But we  Russians cannot understand why the world public was not  indignant at the tragedy in Russia 3-4 October 1993 when,  according to the official figures, 145 people died and hundreds  were injured during the firing on the House of the Soviets (the  "White House"). The people responsible for this action, which  was just as inhuman and criminal as the one in Sarajevo, have  not been brought to justice even though the whole world knows  who they are. Furthermore, they have received not only Russia's  highest awards but also the applause of statesmen who imagine  themselves the guardians of democracy.    One cannot help but notice the more than strange  metamorphosis of the United Nations. Instead of performing a  peacemaking, unifying function, it is being transformed right  before our eyes into some kind of world policeman ready to  punish and actually punishing not so much those who commit acts  against peace and humanitarian principles but primarily those  who have displeased the forces lobbying at UN headquarters. As  evidence let us recall the bombing of Libya and the residential  center of Baghdad and the military actions against opposition  forces in Somalia undertaken under the international  organization's flag by U.S. Army subunits. Decisions to carry  out these and similar unlawful actions are most often made  administratively without discussion by or the sanction of the  Security Council. That is what the United Nations has done this  time too.    There is another strange element in UN activity which can  hardly be left without assessment. It is the fact that  countries or, to be more accurate, the political forces which  dominate them and which for the sake of their own ambitions are  prepared to shed the blood of other peoples and even their own  fellow countrymen and are actually doing so are going  unpunished. Israel systematically bombs South Lebanon -- and  the United Nations does not even wag a threatening finger.  Neither the world public nor the United Nations was disturbed  when Turkey, a member of the United Nations and NATO, wiped the  Kurdish town of Lice from the face of the earth in the space of  a few hours on 22 October 1993.    It is quite well known how much mental energy, how many  diplomatic efforts, and how much money the United Nations  expended to enable the Jews scattered throughout the world at  last to acquire their own statehood. But the United Nations is  totally incapable of forcing Israel to respect the Palestinians'  right to their own state. Nor is this organization particularly  concerned about the fate of the Kurdish people, numbering almost  40 million -- the world's first farmers -- whose culture goes  back many thousands of years. The Kurds' land is divided among  Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. The Kurds' desire to reunite and  form their own state according to the law and the provisions of  the UN Charter is viewed as a manifestation of terrorism and  separatism and is being suppressed most harshly with the tacit  connivance of the United Nations.    The impression is being created that the United Nations is  moving away from its initially proclaimed principles of being an  impartial world arbiter toward being the instrument of the  policy of a group of countries headed by the United States.  Whereas in the past the ambitious tendencies of that group and  the United States were countered by the USSR and the socialist  countries, now that counterbalance has been removed and scope  for unlimited domination of the world has opened up before those  who were used to such sway until 1945. The colonial system  collapsed after the victory over fascism but it seems that  neocolonialism is being reborn on a new basis under the blue  flag of the United Nations and with the assistance of its army  of "blue helmets."</p>

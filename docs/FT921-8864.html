			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: Cigna records lower net of Dollars 108m in final quarter CIGNA, the big Philadelphia-based insurer, yesterday reported after-tax profits of Dollars 108m for the final three months of 1991, down from Dollars 119m in the same period a year earlier. The fourth-quarter results were charged after net realised investment gains of Dollars 1m, compared with a Dollars 25m loss in the year-earlier quarter. The company said that the numbers reflected some reserve increases for investment assets following 'the company's current assessment of unfavourable economic and real estate market conditions'. As a result, Cigna's net earnings for the full year stand at Dollars 449m, against Dollars 330m, after realised investment gains of Dollars 52m, against loss of Dollars 15m the previous year. The results, however, seemed to disappoint the market, and Cigna shares slipped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 54 1/8 . Mr Wilson Taylor, chief executive, said the employee benefits, pension and individual life insurance businesses all reported profits increases for the year, and should contribute to improved overall results in 1992. Premiums for the group overall were Dollars 14.3bn in 1991 against Dollars 14bn, while net investment income totalled Dollars 3.86m compared with Dollars 3.77bn.</p>

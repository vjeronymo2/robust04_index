			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Observer: Value for money Meanwhile what on earth is the Bank of England doing giving half a million pounds to double the size of its Houblon-Norman fund so that it can finance yet more academic research into central banking matters? The Maxwell pensioners or the depositors in BCCI might well believe they have prior claims if there is spare cash about. As for the sum involved, Pounds 500,000 might sound a lot but, if the aim were to maintain the real value of the original 1944 endowment of Pounds 100,000, topped up by Pounds 50,000 in 1967, then the Bank should have injected much more loot. Observer's calculations suggest that the value of the combined endowments has slipped to 21 per cent of their original value in real terms. Is this why the first research project for 1993-94 is to inquire into index bonds and inflationary expectations?</p>

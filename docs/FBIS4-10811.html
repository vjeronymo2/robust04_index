			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Gustavo Lomelin] </F>   [Text] Guadalajara, Jalisco, 10 Apr -- Behind the backdrop  of the 35th annual Assembly of Governors of the Inter-American  Development Bank (IDB), Mexican authorities are striving to  guarantee economic stability to foreign investors. They can no  longer, however, hide the fact that the political crisis is now  stirring up a financial crisis in Mexico.    In fact, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is starting to  lose control of financial variables [variables] because his main  U.S. allies feel deceived. Moreover, an outflow of about $6  billion shows that local and foreign capital has already cast  its vote against Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, the new PRI  [Institutional Revolutionary Party] candidate for president.    Currently, there is a dangerous paradox that could prompt a  new crisis now that the current six-year period is drawing to an  end: Zedillo guarantees economic continuity and offers security  to large-scale capital in the long run, but, in the short-term  and midterm, he cannot offer leadership or confidence.    The goal of this capital flight is not, specifically, to  reject Zedillo, but the fact is that domestic and foreign  circumstances are making it difficult to create a stable  atmosphere for investment. Doubts are emerging over Zedillo's  political sense and his ability to maneuver in a complex  electoral process characterized by division and struggles within  the PRI. Mexico also is facing a dubious investigation into the  assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio amid a yet-to-be-clarified  plot that presages new outbursts of violence, as well as a  conflict in Chiapas that threatens to drag on as long as a dying  system that resists political and social opening continues to  lean toward a harsher, authoritarian line in order to survive.    If there are additional indications of a vicious circle  characteristic of a politically insensitive state and worsening  social decomposition, the first fallout could be a financial  crack [previous word in English].    Increasing interest rates in the United States and political  uncertainty in Mexico are inspiring additional hikes in domestic  interest rates, which in turn discourage private investment and  economic growth. This will lead to higher unemployment, low  consumption, and growing social pressure that will reinforce  political instability.    It might seem pessimistic to say this, but our undeniable  national reality is frightening investors. Confidential data  available to this reporter indicate that eight out of 10  businesses have stocked up [se han cubierto] on dollars. For  the first time in years, the country began to experience capital  flight last month, and the outflow reached nearly $6 billion by  8 April. The country's international reserves, estimated in  late February at $28 billion, have dropped by a comparable  amount. This has virtually nullified a line of credit the U.S.  Treasury Department and Federal Reserve have granted Mexico.    The peso has lost 8.3 percent of its value and is currently  near the ceiling of the range of floating rates. This and no  other reason explains why interest rates on 28-day treasury  certificates have increased from 8.81 to 14.31 percent within  the past 40 days. At the expense of the domestic market, the  Mexican Government is trying to retain investors by offering  then outlandish incentives.    Former "allies," however, are no longer seeking high  financial or speculative profits. Instead, they are now looking  for safety and security that the former Mexican "miracle" can no  longer guarantee. All quarters feel deceived. Two events have  coincided to create this sentiment.    1. One day after Colosio's assasination, Pedro Aspe, Miguel  Mancera, Guillermo Ortiz, and Jose Angel Gurria tried to get the  Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury to extend their lines of  credit from $1 billion to $6 billion.    The White House became concerned over the impact a  devaluation could have on the Mexican economy. However, on 28  March, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL said: "Mexico managed to maneuver  behind the scenes, and a secret agreement prevented panic from  seizing the market."    With this information leaked by Mexican officials, the U.S.  House of Representatives Energy and Trade Committee, headed by  John D. Dingell, is investigating Treasury Secretary Lloyd  Bentsen and Stock Commission President Arthur Levitt on  suspicions of having improperly suspended Mexican shares on the  U.S. market.    Bentsen is quite annoyed over the leak because the Mexicans  violated a secret gentlemen's agreement, and he may refrain from  promoting the $20 billion line of credit the Mexican Government  is negotiating with the World Bank and IMF to avoid a financial  crack [previous word in English] in the country, which will take  several months despite efforts by Jose Cordoba, Mexico's  representative at the IDB.    2. From the evening of 23 March until Holy Week, the  highest-ranking officials of the Mexican financial sector  assured employees, bankers, and consultants for U.S. investment  funds that Colosio's death was the product of the "sick mind of  a crazy assassin who read books on Marxism-Leninism, and not a  plot," but on 4 April, Assistant Prosecutor Miguel Montes  officially admitted that Colosio was the victim of "a planned  action."    The U.S. financial sector (capital) is also annoyed by what  it considers a betrayal, and it has noted that its contact in  Mexico (the financial sector) is unrealistic. This has led to  the flight of U.S. capital, which is also being prompted by  other fears: How will the electoral process turn out? How much  rope will Salinas give Zedillo? What will happen between now  and 21 August and from 21 August through 1 December?    After all is said and done, it is undeniable that with the  same frivolity that Lopez Portillo staked the country's future  on would-be and thwarted wealth from oil, Salinas de Gortari has  staked the country's inclusion in the First World on the Mexican  Stock Market. The greater the risk, the greater the gain or  loss. What else can I say? Those are the rules of the market.</p>

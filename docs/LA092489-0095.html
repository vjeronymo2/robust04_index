			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CASTING JEWISH ACTORS AS JEWISH CHARACTERS  </P> <P> What I said in a telephone interview for Willens' article was that the  Hollywood moguls used to anglicize the names of their stars, not that they  changed their own names, as was incorrectly reported.  </P> <P> Today, many celebrities apparently keep their surnames, but the television  industry casts them with non-Jewish names.  </P> <P> I asked Willens why couldn't Jack Klugman have been cast as Dr. Shapiro instead  of as Dr. Quincy? How about Lt. Goldberg for Peter Falk instead of Columbo?  </P> <P> The TV networks have never, to the best of my knowledge, made a Jew as a Jew  the hero in a dramatic series. Supporting roles, yes, but not leading roles.  </P> <P> HARVEY B. SCHECHTER  </P> <P> Western States Director  </P> <P> Anti-Defamation League  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (9): First of the raiders - Profile, Cem Uzan The black leather furniture and the abstract canvas are the props of tycoons all over the world. Only the insistent drone of the nearby mosque reminds one that this is old Istanbul, not Milan or Manhattan. The office is that of Mr Cem Uzan, 32, who is Turkey's youngest and brashest businessman, and the country's first corporate raider. Rumeli Holding, the family's flagship company, today boasts assets worth up to Dollars 1bn, after a programme of acquisitions which has taken the business scene by storm. In less than a year, the company has staked a claim to a place among Turkey's top five groups. Rumeli was active in the early 1980s in building infrastructure for the Libyan oil industry. The family then acquired two small banks - Adabank and Imarbank. With Mr Uzan's return from university in the US, the group ventured into television, exploiting the technology which allowed it to beam in from Germany, thus sidestepping the constitutional ban on private stations. InterStar was Turkey's first private TV station and now has close to 25 per cent of the sector's advertising revenues. This year, the Uzans embarked on a spending spree, forking out close to Dollars 500m worth in asset purchases. The government's bid to speed up its privatisation programme provided the richest pickings, the group concentrating on sectors which are least affected by the threat of import competition as Turkey moves to a customs union with the European Union. The Uzans bought five state cement factories, in the process outbidding a number of foreign cement concerns. The acquisition of power utilities in Adana and Antalya has given the group a strong presence in the sector ahead of government plans to privatise TEK, the electricity monopoly. The company is now trying to position itself in telecommunications with moves to set up with Alcatel of France on Turkey's GSM system, the pan-European digital standard which will allow countries across Europe to use the same cellular system. With this link-up, Rumeli is well placed for eventual flotation of the telecom arm of PTT, the state post and telephone monopoly. Mr Uzan likes to put a diplomatic gloss on his swashbuckling business style. 'As long as there are mutual benefits, there are alliances. If there are benefits that collide, then there's competition,' he says. On other areas, he is less forthcoming. 'As a private holding company, we don't publish financial figures. But there is no external borrowing on the series of transactions .. It's all being internally financed.' His business methods have not always been transparent. When a Turkish business magazine carried a cover story on the family, Mr Uzan had the entire staff sacked. The story alleged that in 1990 the group orchestrated a run on Imarbank, so as to avoid paying interest on time deposits. The bank had been offering the best rates in the market. Whatever the truth, it was a brilliantly executed exercise. Depositors withdrew their savings and then, seeing how the bank had managed the crisis, piled back in. Imar Bankasi is now one of the best capitalised of the private banks. Mr Uzan's battles continue. Star is engaged in a war of words - and ratings  -with Show, its main rival. Show's owner, the banker, Mr Erol Aksoy, has been labelled a 'son of a Greek' - and in Turkey, that rates as an insult. If that was not enough for Mr Uzan's lawyers, the group also has ongoing court actions against Mr Asil Nadir, the Turkish Cypriot businessman, and Mr Ahmet Ozal, son of the former president, not to mention with Cumhuriyet, Turkey's only serious newspaper. Mr Nadir says he still owns the land on which Media Print, a business he sold to the Uzans, is located. Gunaydin, Mr Nadir's former newspaper, sought court bankruptcy from its creditors, creating a new title under which it now prints. Cumhuriyet took similar action. Both newspapers owe money to the Uzan banks. The takeover of the privatised Cukurova electricity utility proved even more controversial. The Uzans paid over Dollars 80m for an 11.25 per cent stake in the Adana-based utility, then solicited shareholders' proxy voting rights to gain control in a move criticised by the Capital Markets Board, the government's watchdog agent. Finally, there was a series of tense negotiations with members of the Sabanci family. Through Akbank, Sabanci owned 5 per cent of the Cukurova stock. 'They tested us, we tested them. It was all in a civilised manner. There is no big room for bitterness in business. When you grow, I think it's inevitable you tread on people's toes,' says Mr Uzan.' So rapid a diversification of interests might be a cause of concern, but Mr Uzan points out: 'All the acquisitions represent monopolies. There is practically no competition now and none in the foreseeable future. In terms of profits, we don't like competition.'</p>

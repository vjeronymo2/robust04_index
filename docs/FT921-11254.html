			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Care for over-50s dying too soon, and living too long. Now, according to Howard Hodgson, chairman of Hodgson Integrity, which launches a new range of products for the over-50s next month, the industry needs to take a much more creative approach. The great risk now is that people survive their 'third age' of retirement, and live long enough to lapse into dependence again. Hodgson's ambitious package of products for the over-50s is due to be launched next month. This week Private Patients Plan, a medical insurer, launched arguably the most ambitious long-term care (LTC) package to date. LTC insurance involves paying regular premiums, usually starting in middle age. Should you need long-term care at the end of your life, it pays fees. PPP's 'Independence' plan, like those of Aetna Life and Commercial Union, relies on the concept of the 'activity of daily living' (ADL). Payment is made for care once the policyholder is unable to perform a certain number of ADLs. The small print is discomfiting. PPP lists six ADLs: Mobility (the ability to get in and out of chair or bed), washing, dressing, feeding, toileting, and continence. Once you are unable to perform two of these, or once you fail a mental awareness test, you become eligible to receive what PPP calls 'progressive' cover. This provides assisting devices for use in the home. Once you fail three ADLs, claim payments double, allowing you to pay for residential nursing home fees. PPP will take a 'hands on' approach, and pay fees direct to nursing homes. It will also vet them closely, establishing a list of 'approved' care providers. If the care is cheaper than your total eligibility, PPP pockets the difference. The new 'twist' which PPP has added, is to link long-term care insurance to a critical illness or 'dread disease' policy, which pays out a fixed lump sum if you are diagnosed as suffering from a life-threatening condition - heart diseases, strokes, cancers and a few other serious conditions. There is less need for critical illness cover once you have retired, but the potential need for long-term care is greater. PPP thus offers the right to convert from critical illness to LTC cover at the age of 60. The maximum total LTC benefit you could then receive would be the critical illness sum assured. The maximum weekly benefit would be the sum assured divided by 156. You can also buy income replacement or 'permanent health insurance' in the same package. This is potentially attractive. But is it cheap? These policies are complex, and comparisons are awkward. Also, beware of buying insurance you do not need. But the PPP plan might be good value. For cover of Pounds 50,000, and the right to convert at the age of 60, a 39-year-old woman needs to pay Pounds 35.25 per month, and a man Pounds 35.70. Abbey Life, a pioneer of Critical Illness cover, charges Pounds 34.39 and Pounds 43.87 respectively, for cover lasting until age 60. For a 'whole-of-life' plan, which would offer a lump sum on death or critical illness, Abbey would charge Pounds 34.41 and Pounds 44.66 respectively. The lump sum payment could help cover long-term care. This suggests that PPP's premiums are not far out of line with the market.</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Technology: The fax about saving money Spending your way out of recession could be as strong a piece of advice for companies as for governments. Meredith Fischer, vice president of marketing at Pitney Bowes' facsimile division, has done some calculations to prove - not surprisingly, some might say - that buying or renting a new fax machine could save you money. Nevertheless, for the large corporate fax user many of the calculations make surprising reading. The problem for many corporations, says Meredith, is that 'the costs of fax machines are well hidden'. In a survey for Pitney Bowes by Gallup, which questioned large corporate users in the US, Canada and the UK, 65 per cent of UK respondents said they did not know how much it cost to send a fax. Savings can be made in sending faxes: the newer the machine, the faster the transmission and the lower the phone bill. Even more can be saved at the receiving end. Because ordinary paper is less expensive than thermal paper, plain paper fax machines reduce running costs. Perhaps more surprising is that because thermal fax paper is so unpopular half the incoming messages are photocopied, according to Gallup. Taking secretarial costs and paper into account, Fischer reckons that it costs 60p to copy each document. With an average 60 faxed messages received on every corporate fax machine every day in the UK, costs soon mount. All in all, Meredith reckons that buying the latest fax machine could cut the fax bill by Pounds 3,000 a year - for every machine. But savings do not end there. Companies could save more if they used all the functions on the machine, such as delayed transmission, where messages are stored and sent after office hours when tariffs are lower. Companies with data lines between offices - particularly transatlantic data lines - could also save money by sending their inter-office fax messages on those lines. According to Meredith, as many as 90 per cent of all faxed messages from large corporations are sent within the company.</p>

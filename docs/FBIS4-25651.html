			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Go All Out To Rush Harvesting of </F> Summer Grain"]    [Text] Governor Fu Xishou inspected summer harvesting work  in some rural areas of four counties in Chuzhou and Suxian  prefectures, and Bengbu city on 1 and 2 June, at a crucial  moment in summer harvesting in areas along the Huai He and areas  north of it. He said: It is very important to gather the good  summer harvests. In northern Anhui, the summer crop alone can  ensure food supply for the whole year. If the peasants have no  worries about their livelihood, the rural situation will be  stable, and rural stability is important to the stability and  economic development of the whole province. He called on the  cadres and people in those areas to take full advantage of fine  days to go all out to rush the harvesting of summer grain crops;  and to strive to get every seed of summer grain into the  granaries.    When Governor Fu Xishou chaired an executive meeting of the  provincial government on the afternoon of 31 May, he learned of  a possible weather change in the near future. He was so anxious  that he again checked the forecast with the provincial weather  station in the evening, and decided to leave for the countryside  immediately. During those two days, Governor Fu Xishou and his  party travelled more than 500 km and inspected summer harvesting  work in eight villages in Dingyuan county, Huaiyuan county,  Suzhou city, and Lingbi county. On the afternoon of 1 June, Fu  Xishou arrived at the wheat threshing ground of Qiaotouyang  village in Xizhoudian township, Dingyuan county. He grabbed a  handful of wheat grains and checked them carefully. He then  held the hand of peasant Yang Dongyong and cordially asked him  about the area of his wheat crops, the expected completion time  for harvesting, and expected yield. Yang Dongyong answered all  the questions. Then, a responsible comrade of Dingyuan county  informed the governor that the harvesting of the county's  850,000 mu of wheat could be completed in two days. Fu Xishou  was satisfied with this information. In Huanyuan county and  some other localities, Fu Xishou repeatedly told local  responsible comrades to draw on the lessons of several previous  years in which wheat mildewed due to continuous rain. He urged  them to organize the labor force rapidly to rush the harvesting  of summer grain crops, to avoid the loss of grain which was  nearly in their hands, and to prevent the efforts made by  peasants over last six months from being wasted. He called the  departments concerned to provide good services to peasants. Fu  Xishou saw the wheat crops in a large tract of land in the  northern part of Lingbi county were not yet ripe. He asked the  responsible comrades of the county to watch the weather forecast  closely, be well prepared, and seize the opportune time to  organize the peasants to rush harvesting and threshing of the  crops, and to get the harvests into the granaries.    Fu Xishou also inspected some county-run enterprises and  village and town enterprises during his tour.</p>

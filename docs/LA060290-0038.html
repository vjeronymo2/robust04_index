			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> VIOLA, METS GIVE HARRELSON FIRST VICTORY, 4-0  </P> <P> Frank Viola gave up six hits in eight innings and Gregg Jefferies and Mike  Marshall hit solo homers as the New York Mets beat the Phillies, 4-0, at  Philadelphia Friday night for their first victory under Manager Bud Harrelson.  </P> <P> The loss was the fifth in a row for the Phillies, who haven't won since a  one-day stand atop the National League East last week.  </P> <P> Viola (8-2) struck out five and walked three before getting relief help in the  ninth from John Franco. Harrelson is 1-1 since succeeding the fired Dave  Johnson Tuesday.  </P> <P> Jefferies traded places with Howard Johnson in the order, the first major move  by Harrelson since taking control. Johnson led off and Jefferies batted third.  </P> <P> "I'd love to stay there (third in the batting order)," said Jefferies, adding  that he never had batted first before coming to the Mets.  </P> <P> "I always batted third," he said. "I want to be the guy in that situation, the  bases loaded, I kind of missed that. Instead of driving in runs I've been  trying to get on base," Jefferies said.  </P> <P> Phillie starter Dennis Cook lost for the first time after five victories,  giving up eight hits and all four Met runs. The Phillies' Lenny Dykstra singled  in the fifth to equal his career-high 14-game hitting streak. Dykstra had two  hits and increased his average to .396.  </P> <P> San Francisco 6, Houston 5 -- Greg Litton's two-out, bases-loaded grounder in  the 11th inning scored Robby Thompson with the winning run as the Giants  spoiled a three-home run game by the Astros' Glenn Davis at San Francisco.  </P> <P> Thompson got a one-out single off loser Jim Clancy (1-4), the sixth Astros'  pitcher. Gary Carter's double sent Thompson to third and Jose Uribe was  intentionally walked to load the bases.  </P> <P> Litton hit a sharp grounder to shortstop Rafael Ramirez, who dived for the ball  but was unable to make a play at home plate as Thompson scored.  </P> <P> Steve Bedrosian (1-3) pitched two hitless innings of relief as the Giants ended  a five-game home losing streak and won at Candlestick Park for only the seventh  time in 23 games.  </P> <P> Montreal 4, Pittsburgh 1 -- The Expos scored three runs in the fourth inning at  Pittsburgh without a well-hit ball and ended the Pirates' five-game winning  streak.  </P> <P> The Expos used Spike Owen's bases-loaded walk, a passed ball, a hit-and-run  single and a sacrifice bunt in the fourth to win their fourth game in a row and  end losing pitcher Doug Drabek's six-game winning streak.  </P> <P> Kevin Gross (7-3) struck out six and walked none in beating Drabek (7-2), who  lost for the first time since a 4-1 loss to the Chicago Cubs April 14.  </P> <P> St. Louis 6, Chicago 4 -- Jose Oquendo ended a one-for-16 slump with an RBI  single in the fourth inning and drove in Milt Thompson with a squeeze bunt in  the sixth for the Cardinals in St. Louis.  </P> <P> Terry Pendleton also drove in two runs for the Cardinals, who pulled into a  fifth-place tie with the Cubs, the defending East champions. The Cardinals have  won only two of their last seven games and the Cubs have lost eight of 11.  </P> <P> Jose DeLeon (5-3) needed relief help from Ken Dayley and Lee Smith, who got the  last out for his fifth save.  </P> <P> Atlanta 16, San Diego 11 -- Oddibe McDowell had a three-run homer for his third  hit of the game as the Braves struck for eight runs on three homers in the  second inning in San Diego.  </P> <P> Ron Gant, who scored four runs, hit a two-homer and Dale Murphy had a three-run  shot in the second as the Braves took a 12-3 lead.  </P></p>

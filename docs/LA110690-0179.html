			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THIEVES DIDN'T HAVE A PRAYER AT MONASTERY  </P> <P> Heavily armed bandits seeking cash at a wealthy, isolated monastery wounded a  monk in a gun battle with brothers who had taken up arms after a wave of  robberies.  </P> <P> The Rev. Pierre-Marie, abbot of the 19th-Century Trappist monastery Notre-Dame  des Neiges, said a burglar alarm sounded at the monastery about 3 a.m. Monday,  an hour before morning prayers.  </P> <P> The bell signaled to the 36 monks, who produce 4 million bottles of wine a year  on their immense estate in the Languedoc region of southern France, that they  were being robbed for the third time this year.  </P> <P> The monks have been organizing themselves as a self-defense force the last few  weeks. In previous robberies, "the telephone lines were cut and we couldn't  call for help," the abbot explained today.  </P> <P> Arming themselves with shotguns, the brothers raced outside to a nearby  administrative building where the alarm had sounded.  </P> <P> One brother blasted a round into the air, flushing two masked men. They fled  down the winding road to the monastery.  </P> <P> The bandits found their way barricaded by a parked car -- and shotgun-toting  Brother Zepherin, organizer of the monastery's hunting expeditions, who  demanded they stop.  </P> <P> The robbers pulled out a sawed-off shotgun and a semiautomatic pistol and  opened fire on Brother Zepherin and other monks approaching in cars.  </P> <P> The monks returned fire.  </P> <P> Brother Zepherin fell with 200 pellets in his leg.  </P> <P> The robbers got into a waiting car with one or two accomplices inside and sped  off empty-handed, the abbot said.  </P> <P> They were still at large today.  </P></p>

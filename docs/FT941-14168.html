			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Observer: Trotting along Full marks to the trade mags for alerting the stock market to the chat going on between advertising agencies Gold Greenlees Trott and Young &amp; Rubicam. Fewer marks for suggesting that Y&amp;R might gobble up the smaller agency. It's much more likely to be GGT swallowing Y&amp;R's London outpost. Y&amp;R, the world's biggest privately owned advertising agency, has been having a bad time recently. Its London office has seen chief executives come and go  -five in the last decade. The latest defections - of managing director Tim Lindsay and chief executive Jerry Judge to Lowe Howard-Spink just before Christmas - have brought matters to a head. Of course, it would be a terrible loss of face if Y&amp;R were to be gobbled up by GGT and it's still 50-50 whether a deal is struck. If it is, look forward to yet another impossible advertising acronym: GGT-YR.</p>

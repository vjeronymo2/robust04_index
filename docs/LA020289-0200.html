			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAS AMIGAS' GUARDIAN ANGELS ARE WELL-DRESSED  </P> <P> Las Amigas de San Jose, a support group for St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, drew  a crowd of 200 to the Anaheim Hilton on Saturday to see a dozen California  Angels and their wives model casual and evening wear.  </P> <P> Cocktails, dinner, fashion show, dancing -- same package as last year, at the  same price ($125 per couple).  </P> <P> Last year, the Amigas nabbed TV sportscaster Fred Roggin for the emcee job, and  he unleashed an irreverent commentary that played like a comedy routine. Roggin  ragged the ballplayers as they paraded self-consciously down the runway, and  they responded by mugging, giggling and showing off.  </P> <P> This year, emcee duties were more conservatively divvied between Angels' radio  announcer Al Conin and Barbara Roberson (she works for Santa Ana/Mainplace,  which provided the clothes). Conin reported on the players' careers, Roberson  described the outfits.  </P> <P> Fun for guests included the opportunity of chatting with the athletes before a  steak and salmon dinner.  </P> <P> Second baseman Mark McLemore described his off-field fashion style as "sweaters  and baggies . . . comfortable clothes."  </P> <P> Backup catcher Darrell Miller was asked about his reputation as the GQ Man of  the ballclub (this insight from Conin during cocktail hour).  </P> <P> Miller laughed. "Well, if that's so, it's only because of this lady," he said,  nodding to his wife, Kelly.  </P> <P> "He may get beat up in the parking lot," joked Kelly, "but he leaves home  looking good."  </P> <P> Arlyne Parrish, wife of catcher Lance Parrish, also admitted to taking an  active role in her hubby's haberdashery. Asked if the big guy likes to slouch  around the house in sweats, Arlyne responded: "No, I don't let him." Around the  Parrishes' Diamond Bar home, said Arlyne, it's "jeans and boots once in a  while, but mostly I got him into all this surfer junk now."  </P> <P> The benefit raised an estimated $20,000 to help expand the hospital's surgical  facilities, according to event chairwoman Kathy Cheek.  </P> <P> Among those organizing the fund-raiser were Rina Santora, Jana Burwell, Suanne  Karlinski, Karen Buttacavoli, Judi Allen, Debbie Johnston, Judy Heric, Shirley  Edelman and Jan Cassen.  </P></p>

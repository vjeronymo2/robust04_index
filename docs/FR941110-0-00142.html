			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a result of our review of these comments, we are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making final proposed &sect;488.180(e)(1)(i), Certification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance or noncompliance, because it appears to conflict  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with &sect;488.402(f).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As proposed, we are providing in &sect;488.325(f), that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State must provide the State's long-term care ombudsman with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any report of adverse actions specified at &sect;488.406 imposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a facility. We believe that this provision will keep  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents informed about each enforcement action. Whatever  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional publicity States may wish to give notices of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse action is their decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are also revising paragraph (f) to note the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceptions in notification requirements for civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalties and restructured it to clarify them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 488.404&blank;Factors To Be Considered in Selecting Remedies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We received comments on proposed &sect;488.204, as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on our solicitation of comments in the preamble to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule, about the scope and severity measures;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically, we asked for comments on how scope and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severity values were described and how they were to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assigned. We will address all of the comments we received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on scope and severity in this section of the preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The majority of commenters did not comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the scope scale. Several commenters expressed support for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using scope and severity scales to determine the enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response to facility noncompliance. Other commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opposed using these scales. Of those opposed, some believed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the scales, absent any measurable criteria, introduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another opportunity for surveyor inconsistencies to occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Others thought the scope and severity level definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were too broad and vague to be applied consistently by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveyors, allowing too much government discretion in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selection of remedies, while one commenter believed that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of remedies should be left to the judgment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the survey agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters argued that the scales were impractical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because they were either too complex or prescriptive and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> left no room for surveyor judgment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters argued that the use of scope and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severity scales conflict with Congressional intent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminate a hierarchy of participation requirements. They  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contend that by ranking the seriousness, that is,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importance, of a facility's deficiencies, the scope and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severity scales foster the belief that some requirements are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more important than others.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter questioned why the scope and severity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scales were being put into regulation. This commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believed that codifying the criteria used for determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies is inappropriate and will invite additional legal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> challenges by nursing home providers dissatisfied with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severity and scope level determinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter was concerned that the scope and severity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scales failed to provide enough regulatory guidance on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exact criteria that will be used in making remedy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinations to ensure that the enforcement response is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate to the nature of the noncompliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We received a variety of proposals for reconfiguring the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scope and severity scales from provider organizations, State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governments and consumer advocate organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One consumer advocate organization proposed a scope and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severity scale with three tiers of severity (immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardy, substandard quality of care, and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violations), while retaining the definition of scope as we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposal called for a plan of correction for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level 1 deficiencies (other violations) regardless of scope  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and a mandatory civil money penalty for scopes of 3 and 4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the proposal specified that the State or HCFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must impose a directed plan of correction if the violation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is repeated. All other remedies could be imposed at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option of the State or HCFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

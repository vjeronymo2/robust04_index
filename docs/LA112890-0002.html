			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> UCLA EXTENSION REACHES OUT TO LATINOS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: THE UNIVERSITY IS OFFERING COURSES DESIGNED TO LURE PROSPECTIVE  STUDENTS. ONLY 3% OF THE CONTINUING EDUCATION PROGRAM'S 100,000 STUDENTS ARE  HISPANIC.  </P> <P> UCLA Extension, the university's vast continuing-education arm, has long drawn  its enrollment from its surrounding Westside population.  </P> <P> But changing demographics that point to an increasing Latino population in the  Los Angeles Basin have prompted extension officials to reach across town to the  East Side to maintain a steady enrollment.  </P> <P> "We have to look at what we are offering for the Latino population in terms of  career advancement and just plain interests," said Patricia Mendoza, a former  special assistant in the UCLA Office of Student Affairs who now heads the  extension's Latino outreach program.  </P> <P> Mendoza said she believes that there are two big reasons for the low Latino  enrollment: the Westside location of the campus and poor promotion.  </P> <P> "We want the Latino community to know that although we are not located in an  area that is traditionally Latino, we are sensitive to Latino concerns," she  said. "We know that that is one of the reasons that a lot of people are not  familiar with what UCLA Extension offers."  </P> <P> About one-third of the region's population is Latino, but Latinos make up only  about 3% of the more than 100,000 students who enroll annually in UCLA  Extension courses, according to extension officials. Maintaining a steady  enrollment is important because UCLA Extension does not receive any state aid  and is supported almost exclusively by class fees.  </P> <P> Although some classes are offered in downtown Los Angeles and other satellite  locations, Mendoza said the challenge will be to attract more Latinos to the  Westwood campus, because the bulk of the classes in certified programs will be  offered there.  </P> <P> She hopes to do that by offering more Latino-oriented classes, such as the  eight-week course "Chicano Culture in America," which was offered in the fall  quarter.  </P> <P> "The course cuts across different disciplines," Mendoza said. "We wanted to  make it attractive for teachers, as well as for Latinos to have an opportunity  to learn more about themselves. Also, because of the changing demography,  non-Latinos might also have an interest in their Latino neighbors."  </P> <P> For the winter quarter, which begins Jan. 7, UCLA Extension will be offering an  advertising and marketing course on reaching the Latino market.  </P> <P> Extension officials hope to make the cost of attending extension courses easier  by broadening a minority community outreach scholarship program -- Scholarships  to Encourage Extension Diversity -- to include Latinos.  </P></p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Major orders review of Sinn Fein broadcasting rules MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, yesterday ordered a review of attempts by television stations to circumvent regulations which restrict broadcasts by Sinn Fein spokesmen. Mr Major also confirmed that he will meet the leaders of the four non-violent Northern Ireland parties shortly for a round of bilateral discussions on the peace process. In Belfast police revealed that a man is to be charged in connection with the Hallowe'en massacre of seven people in Greysteel, County Londonderry. A second is likely to be accused of withholding information. Downing Street said Mr Major called for a review of the broadcasting rules after seeing recent interviews with Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. Mr Major was said to have been disturbed by the use of actors reading synchronised scripts, to get round restrictions preventing transmission of Mr Adams' voice. In the Commons the prime minister told Dame Jill Knight, a Conservative backbencher, that the use of actors 'stretched the present guidelines to the limit, and perhaps beyond'. The review will be carried out by Mr Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary, who has primary responsibility for broadcasting law. Mr Brooke, who is understood to have been given a free hand to recommend any changes he thinks necessary, is expected to consult Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary. However, he is not expected to bow to demands from Dame Jill and other Conservatives for a ban on all broadcast interviews with Sinn Fein. Downing Street said Mr Major would begin seeing Northern Ireland political leaders tomorrow. The first meetings are expected to be with Dr John Alderdice, leader of the moderate unionist Alliance party, and Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party. The prime minister's office is trying to arrange meetings with the Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, and Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, the biggest unionist grouping. The round of meetings is intended to stress Mr Major's availability to all political leaders in Northern Ireland who reject the use of violence. It follows the prime minister's decision to accept a request for a meeting from Mr Hume, who wants to discuss his talks on prospects for peace with Mr Adams. However, the meetings will also allow Mr Major to lay the groundwork for round-table talks at which the government has promised to set out fresh peace proposals. Five men were arrested in connection with the Greysteel massacre yesterday, but two were later released. Detectives are now questioning 11 people in connection with the shootings at Gough Barracks, Armagh.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Indonesia (5): An economy that is too big to ignore - Most Jakarta stockbrokers are in difficulties but look foward to better times STOCKBROKERS in Jakarta, used to the good life of chauffeur-driven cars, wood-panelled offices and generous housing allowances, are facing the challenge of justifying their expense. While a few security houses claim a profit on their trading operations, brokers admit the majority of foreign and local houses are running at a loss. Few brokers, however, doubt the long-term potential of the Jakarta stock market; a presence in Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country, will remain a must for foreign brokerages. 'It fits in nicely with the south-east Asia package security houses offer,' says Ms Jacqueline Lenterman, head of research for Jardine Fleming in Jakarta, adding that an active trading department is necessary to service the profit-making corporate finance operations. The market is still recovering from the trauma of a boom to bust cycle in 1990-91 when the composite index crashed from 682 points to 225. The result has been a damaging loss of confidence of local investors in equities. Company dividends only yield about four per cent, while bank deposit rates of 14 per cent are still available. Brokers complain local investors have a poor understanding of capital growth. Local investors retort that they have seen the value of their shares halved in the last two years. Foreign investors, in particular global and regional fund managers required to have Indonesian exposure, are now the market's key players in terms of trading volume and in raising finance for new issues. A foreign broker says: 'We technically have a public offering in Indonesia but in practical terms we pre-place shares with foreigners.' This has, however, exacerbated the market's illiquidity as foreign institutions tend to buy large blocks of shares as long-term investments. Anthony Davies, managing director of Baring Securities Indonesia, says: 'The foreigners are the long-term players, It's the locals who create the day-to-day volume which makes a market.' As a result, trading volume has remained stagnant, averaging just Dollars 13.2m a day last year, compared with Dollars 12.4m in 1991 and Dollars 16m in 1990. Although in the last two years 30 new companies have listed - bringing to 158 the total number of listed companies - the market's capitalisation has fallen from Dollars 24.4bn in 1990 to Dollars 19.3bn at the end of last year. One way of improving liquidity would be to mobilise pension funds into becoming active participants in the market. The two principal state-funds, Taspen and Astek, held assets equivalent to Dollars 3.2bn at the end of 1991, but only about Dollars 200m in equities, compared withg more than Dollars 1.9bn in time deposits. An equally cautious approach to equities has been adopted by private pension schemes with estimated assets of Dollars 4.5bn, insurance companies with more than Dollars 800m in assets and five major charitable foundations chaired by President Suharto with funds of about Dollars 1.5bn. A new pension law, however, regulating the assets pension funds may hold should increase their holdings of equities. Brokers say the shift may be gradual but could lead to pension funds investing a further Dollars 250m in the stock market within a year. The government is also expected to support the creation of investment funds, which would allow small pension funds to pool assets. At least two companies are planning onshore funds, listed on the Jakarta stock exchange, investing in equities, bonds and government paper. Other moves being considered by the government to improve liquidity include: allowing foreigners to buy more than 49 per cent of a company's listed shares, the current limit; removing capital gains tax payable by local investors; and accelerating a move toward scripless trading. The need for an improved trading system was underlined in March when two fraudsters sold about Rp12bn of fake shares into the market. Trading in five of Indonesia's largest and most actively traded companies was suspended whilst the scam was investigated. The forged share certificates were of exceptionally high quality, carrying brokers' stamps, correct identification numbers and passing ultra-violet tests on water-marks. More worrying, however, was an admission by stock exchange officials that the printing quality of a third of genuine share certificates is sub-standard. The week before the scandal broke the market was in bullish mood with turnover exceeding Rp500bn. Trading volume in the following week was less then Rp100bn. But as Mr Davies explains, market illiquidity is not just a function of a poor trading system, 'it's a matter of there not being enough shares around'. This stems from the willingness of Bapepam, the government's capital markets authority, to allow companies to float just a small minority of shares to the public, whilst keeping the majority in the founders' hands. The estimated 'free-float' of shares (those actively traded) for Bank Internasional Indonesia, the largest listed bank, is 11 per cent; for Gudang Garam, the dominant cigarette manufacturer, 12 per cent; for Indocement, the country's largest listed company, 13 per cent. Whilst brokers publish glossy equity lists recommending investors to buy into companies, in practical terms the stock is simply not available. Some brokers suggest the government should insist on the majority shareholders of existing listed companies further diluting their stake and demanding that new companies coming to the market have a minimum 'free float' of 25 per cent. Such a move, however, could be counter-productive. Owners of private companies could become wary of going public if the government sets a precedent of forcing majority shareholders to sell off their holdings. Brokers still believe Indonesia will follow the path of Thailand and Malaysia to become a major emerging market with a daily turnover of Dollars 100m plus. They also concede, however, that deep-rooted structural problems within the market will take several years to overcome.</p>

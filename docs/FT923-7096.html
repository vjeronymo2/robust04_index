			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Barclays to appeal over MCC ruling BARCLAYS Bank is to appeal against the High Court's refusal last month to grant it an injunction stopping the administrators of Maxwell Communication Corporation suing it in the US bankruptcy court for Dollars 30m (Pounds 15.5m). The bank received the money, which it had demanded under an overdraft facility it had given MCC, three weeks after the death of Robert Maxwell in November last year. Price Waterhouse, the administrators, contended that the payment was an unlawful preference over the claims of other MCC creditors and asserted the right to sue for it in New York, where MCC is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Barclays argued that the English court was the natural forum for trial of the dispute because the overdraft facility was an English commercial transaction, governed by English law, to provide working capital for an English company and its UK subsidiaries. Mr Justice Hoffmann said that, though an English company, MCC's principal assets - estimated at between Dollars 700m and Dollars 1bn - were in the US, and the Dollars 30m had been paid to Barclays out of the proceeds of the sale of the computer publishing division of Macmillan, MCC's principal US subsidiary. He added that an injunction could only antagonise the US court and prejudice the co-operation between the Chapter 11 proceedings and UK administration.</p>

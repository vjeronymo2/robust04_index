			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department disagrees with the commenters that stated that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FOB price and the fee-for-service price represent the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> figures. The FOB price represents the processor's cost of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producing an item prior to shipment and delivery. FOB pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes the cost of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> all  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ingredients used in the manufacture of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the product; the price reduction for donated food is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflected in the FOB price. Fee-for-service, on the other hand,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represents the cost of ingredients (other than donated food)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labor, packaging, overhead, and other costs incurred in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversion of the donated food into the specified end product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The net case price (the FOB price minus the commodity discount or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refund for the donated food) and fee-for-service are equivalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prices. The Department believes that the definition of fee-for-service is correct as written in the proposed rule, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, the definition is adopted without change in the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Four comments, all in favor, were received in response to section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 250.30(c)(4)(viii)(D) of the proposed rule which would require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the value credits of any by-products to be listed on the end  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product data schedule. Two of these commenters stated that they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently require this information to be part of the processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement. This provision is adopted without change in the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Only one comment, which was favorable, was received on section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 250.30(e)(1)(iv) of the proposed rule which would establish new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fee-for-service billing procedures. Distributing agencies have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been using the proposed fee-for-service billing procedures for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of years without problem pursuant to a policy memo dated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> March 22, 1989. Therefore, this final rule contains these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Two commenters were in favor of section 250.30(e)(3) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule which would restrict the sale of end products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing both substitutable and non-substitutable (meat and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poultry) donated food through distributors to either the refund,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hybrid, or alternate value pass-through system and nine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters were opposed. Those who were opposed to the proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wanted to have the option to approve the sale of end products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing both substitutable and non-substitutable donated food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under fee-for-service arrangements. Additionally, several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters were opposed to the use of the term ``sold'' in section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 250.30(e)(3) of the proposed rule in regard to end products being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``sold'' to recipient agencies through distributors. They stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that fee-for-service end products should be delivered but not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> sold  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> to a distributor. One commenter stated that the word ``sold''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implied that any quantity of end product can be purchased by any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recipient agency. That commenter further said that this is in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contrast to the actual availability of a commodity and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation process that is associated with non-substitutable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commodities that is used by FCS and distributing agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Four comments were received on the impact that the proposal would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make on end products manufactured from both substitutable and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-substitutable donated food and delivered through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distributors. However, only one commenter provided a possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative to the proposed rule. That commenter stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since distributing agencies, and ultimately recipient agencies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive specific allocations of meat and poultry, the quantity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meat and poultry made available to a processor should be pre-assigned, based on a fair share apportionment and the recipient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's choice. The pre-assigned end products may then be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> returned to the recipient agency through a distributor. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fee-for-service billing process through a distributor for all end  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products containing meat or poultry which are sold through a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distributor would be accomplished by either: 1) a dual billing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system through which the recipient agency is billed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor for the fee-for-service and the distributor bills for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the storage and delivery of end products or 2) a system through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the processor bills separately for the fee-for-service and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the distributor's storage and delivery charges. If these end  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products should also contain substitutable foods, that portion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the value pass-through could be handled as a refund or discount,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated on the processor's invoice. Both types of information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be shown on the end product data schedule. The other three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters pointed out the impact that the proposal would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without proposing alternatives. Their comments are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1) if the proposed rule results in prohibiting end products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing protein from being sold via a distributor, unless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified by a value pass-through system, it could result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors leaving the program; 2) this proposed change may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in meat and poultry processors choosing not to utilize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> donated flour, oil, or other donated foods because they would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to choose a value pass-through system other than fee-for-service; 3) the use of fee-for-service is necessary in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production of end products made with donated meat and poultry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because of the difficulty in replacing the donated product and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the prohibition against substitution; and 4) it is uncertain as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to how the use of a refund or discount system instead of a fee-for-service could assure that there was no substitution of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial food for non-substitutable donated food. Due to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns raised by the commenters opposed to the proposal,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 250.30(e)(3) of the proposed rule will not be adopted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the final rule, and processing contracts may continue to be made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under fee-for-service arrangements when such end products are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delivered and sold through distributors, regardless of whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they are manufactured with both substitutable and non-substitutable donated foods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

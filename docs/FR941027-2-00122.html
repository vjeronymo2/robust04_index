The southern section of the proposed Loop 49 extends from State Highway 155 to State Highway 110 in southern Smith County. The length of the project varies, depending on the selected alternative, from approximately 15.3 kilometers (9.5 miles) to 18.5 kilometers (11.5 miles). The proposed action is intended to provide access and increased mobility to the southern Tyler/Smith County area; to alleviate traffic congestion on existing roadways in urbanized Smith County; and to provide a safer, more convenient route for traffic travelling through the Tyler area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives to the proposed action to be discussed in the EIS consist of (1) taking no action; and (2) improving existing roadways in the urbanized areas of Smith County. The build alternatives include three alternative alignments along new location rights-of-way connecting State Highway 155 to State Highway 110. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Impacts caused by the construction and operation of Loop 49 will vary according to the alternative alignments utilized. Generally, impacts would include the following: transportation impacts (construction detours, construction traffic, and mobility improvement), air and noise impacts from construction equipment and operation of the roadway, water impacts from construction area and roadway stormwater runoff, impacts to waters of the United States including wetlands from right-of-way encroachment, and impacts to residents and businesses based on potential relocations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies, and to private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed interest in the proposal. A Major Investment Study has been completed in compliance with the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. In addition, several meetings have been held by the Loop 49 Steering Committee, composed of representatives of local governments, agencies, and interested organizations and citizens. A public meeting was held on October 13, 1994, at Robert E. Lee High School in Tyler, Texas, at which public comments on the proposed action and alternatives were requested. In addition, a public hearing will be held after publication of the Draft EIS. Public notice will be given of the time and place of the hearing. The Draft EIS will be available for public and agency review and comment prior to the public hearing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA or TxDOT at the addresses provided above. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20.205, Highway Research, Planning and Construction.

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Welsh quangos face crackdown MrJohn Redwood, Welsh secretary, is tightening control of Welsh quangos to improve their accountability in the wake of a series of scandals. These culminated this week in a fraud squad investigation of the foreign expenses claimed by Professor John Catford, who resigned on Wednesday as director of Health Promotion Wales. Prof Catford denies any misuse of public funds. Mr Redwood said yesterday that he was 'very upset' by the scandals. He added: 'The people of Wales expect us to show we have been honest in exposing what has gone on and have taken the right action to deal with it. That's what I intend to do.' The biggest spending agencies, such as the Welsh Development Agency, will now have annual meetings with Mr Redwood to review performance and set targets. Other big agencies, such as the Development Board for Rural Wales, will report to Sir Wyn Roberts, Welsh minister. Both the WDA and DBRW have been heavily criticised by the National Audit Office and the Commons public accounts committee. Other executive agencies will report to Mr Gwilym Jones, parliamentary under-secretary. Mr Redwood said the review meetings would provide 'a sharper focus' to agency policy requirements and targets. 'I've asked officials to work up the kind of targets and requirements we intend to impose on each body andI've started talking to the major bodies about it,' he said. Mr Michael Scholar, Welsh Office permanent secretary, will take responsibility for ensuring that chief executives are following agreed procedures. Mr Redwood said he intended to set a climate in which people understood that compliance with regulations and probity came first. 'They also have to understand that, if a mistake is made or something worse happens, appropriate action will be taken.' Mr Ron Davies, Labour's shadow Welsh secretary, yesterday called on Mr Redwood to resign. 'He has been unable to curb the excesses of quangos in Wales,' Mr Davies said.

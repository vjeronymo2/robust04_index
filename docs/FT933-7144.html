			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Atwood barter deal takes the biscuit - Moneyless trade is being made relevant to mainstream business WHEN Keebler, the troubled US biscuit maker, saw a high-profile product launch fall flat in autumn last year it was left with Dollars 1m (Pounds 660,000) of unusable packaging. Rather than write it off as scrap, Keebler talked to Atwood Richards, a leading US barter group. Instead of buying the packaging alone, Atwood asked Keebler, the US subsidiary of United Biscuits of the UK, to fill the packs with biscuits and agreed to buy the filled packs - worth Dollars 14m - for sale only in markets where Keebler had no presence. Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and the Baltic states were targeted. Keebler was to be paid in 'trade credits', which were eventually exchanged for packaging, shipping services and marketing. Atwood used roubles paid by the Russians to buy local products and services. Atwood also offered Keebler the right to take over the distribution network it had set up in eastern Europe. For Keebler the deal had many attractions: it did not have to write off out-dated stock; it exploited unused capacity on its production line to fill the packs; it was paid the full wholesale price - or its equivalent in trade credits - for its incremental production; and gained, at no cost, marketing and distribution networks in new markets. Atwood's distinction over 35 years as a trader has been to stretch the boundaries of barter. The sector is more traditionally associated with commodity trading, the former communist regimes of east and central Europe, and with the disaster-driven improvisations of companies trying to fend off the receiver. It may be a fashion house with an over-run of this year's colour; a men's suitmaker who missed this season's switch to double-breasted suits; a factory with unused capacity in the winter season - or Keebler packaging made useless by a new marketing campaign. With an estimated Dollars 13bn of unused or surplus merchandise in warehouses across the US alone, Mr Moreton Binn, principal shareholder in Atwood, has the chance to make barter relevant to mainstream business wherever it is based. 'This year's swimwear is not like Chateau Lafite Rothschild - it doesn't get better next year,' he says. Garments account for perhaps 40 per cent of Atwood's overall business. Seasonal goods ranging from beach umbrellas to golf clubs and skateboards are also significant as retailers need to clear shelf space before autumn and winter. 'The world is a buffet,' Mr Binn notes. 'There is always somebody, some place in the world that uses or needs barter.' A businessman has to have alternatives, he says. 'When someone shuts down the motorway, you have to find an alternative route to a destination.' Atwood's business is finding alternatives. Its distinctive strengths have to be in marketing, distribution, and achieving a range in the inventory of goods and services it can offer to clients. Companies can spend their trade credits on products as diverse as packaging, office furniture, hydraulic presses, mainframe computers and refractory products, and services such as airline seats, hotel rooms, cleaning services, or television advertising space. It has bought and sold between Omega, the watchmaker, US Steel, Goodyear Tire and Rubber, Canon, Massey Ferguson, Amoco and JC Penny. Mr Trevor Edwards, head of the group's London office, confesses that the first response of a company executive to an approach from Atwood is cool. 'People are approached almost on a daily basis by people wanting to buy stock for cash. But the offers are so derisory that they ignore them. Often they're as low as 20 per cent of wholesale value. When I say we will buy at near to wholesale price, companies often think it's another come-on,' he says. In Skelmersdale, Lancashire, Mr Geoff Marsden, managing director of Snack Factory, a recently established supplier of crisps and other snack foods to the UK market, was no exception when he received a cold call from Mr Edwards to discuss a barter deal worth Pounds 5m a year for two years, allowing Atwood to sell the company's crisps across Europe. 'I'm treating all this with my tongue in my cheek, but there is no cost for me to try it,' he says. 'At present, I can't think of a negative. It allows me to do some test marketing and establish distribution in markets I don't have the time or resources to target myself.' Whether the deal goes ahead depends on the results of market research being carried out by Atwood - another plus for Mr Marsden, who could not afford to pay for this across Europe. In the four months since Atwood set up in London the company has garnered 40 clients and has signed five barter contracts, ranging from Nottingham lace and biscuits from Cornwall, to office furniture from Bath, athletics wear from Scotland, and denim jeans from a London company. According to Mr Binn there are just four components of a company's costs that cannot be bartered for: wages, rents, utilities such as water and electricity, and bank charges. Beyond these, which may account for half a company's outlay, there is no reason any other cost must be monetised. He challenges the suggestion that his company might be seen as a vulture, feeding on recession-injured companies. 'The business survives at all times. Not all businesses do well at the same time. Nor is the world that efficient. And trying to predict what the market for your product is going to look like next year is the biggest gamble of all.' Mr Edwards is more vehement, regretting that Atwood had not been set up in the UK in 1989. 'There are companies that have failed, and people that have lost jobs, where this need not have happened if we had been here.'</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / History frittered away This week's argument over D-day should be ephemeral, a puffball floated on currents of momentary outrage. Yet the heated debate over how to mark the 50th anniversary of the Normandy landings of June 6 1944 is instructive. There are two lessons to be learned. First, it is evident that the government's luck has not yet begun to turn. Second, Britain still fails to comprehend the significance of its own recent history. Its politicians are dimly aware of how fundamentally the world has changed over the past half-century, but they are not courageous enough to convey their fuzzy understanding to the electorate. These are separate issues, to be addressed in turn. Sighing, we must start with the little matter of the government's persistent ill-fortune. For a Conservative administration to find itself at odds with the country's most revered old soldiers is yet another sign that the Furies have turned against it. To pick a squabble with the police, as the Tories did a few months ago, is careless. To follow that by contriving to upset Dame Vera Lynn is suicidal. Dame Vera, a singer, rose to fame during the second world war as a popular entertainer of the troops. She has since become a symbol of Britain's mid-century glory. She never fails to give us her heroic song. We know we'll never meet again some sunny day, but we like to hear her promise, in pure Doris Day overlaid with a fine English intonation, that we will. Her position is clear. If her 'boys' - the veterans' associations - want her to sing, in Hyde Park or elsewhere, she will. If not, not. This complicates matters. Somewhat late in the proceedings, the veterans have expressed displeasure at the tackier elements of the programme of civilian events scheduled between June 4 and 6. They do not take issue with the military ceremonies arranged by the Ministry of Defence. Those are formal, solemn commemorations. Their distaste is understandable. Many lives were lost on the Normandy beaches. The survivors want respectful remembrance, not street happenings. Some of the possibilities for the latter (sand castle contests; eating 'Spam fritters') have been derided in newspapers that originally supported the notion of a festival. This media-augmented turn in the national mood had the predictable result: the government panicked. The minister in the firing line is Mr Peter Brooke, the secretary for national heritage. A schoolboy in 1944, he remem-bers clambering over tanks on the great day. Others of his age recall swarms of aircraft, buzzing like bees, heading south and south-east. Yet others swear there was dancing in the streets. For civilians the exciting prospect of potential victory may have outweighed intimations of the casualties to come. Mr Brooke's programme was originally intended to express the incipient home-front optimism of D-day. His department, which is responsible for tourism, chose to co-ordinate the many local events and, imprudently, to appoint Sir Tim Bell, a public relations consultant whose name is associated with his work for Lady Thatcher in the 1980s. Mr Brooke, or his civil servants, should have known better. Nothing could be further from the collectivist, communitarian egalitarianism of the 1940s than the spirit of the 1980s. Sir Tim and his firm were, however, hired to do a job. The heritage department must take responsibility for what was proposed. It is up to the head of that department to answer for the ensuing row. To patch it up, Mr Brooke has to bring off an acceptable deal with the old soldiers and, by extension, Dame Vera. No fool, he is perfectly capable of doing so. Yesterday he kept an eye on his undersecretary and negotiator, Mr Iain Sproat, as the latter sought to ap-pease the vets. We may be sure that whatever is neces-sary will be done. The government's immediate loss is any political advantage that might have been gained from the celebrations, which take place a few days before the elections to the European Parliament. Tough. The nation's loss is the chance of debating the contemporary significance of the events of summer 1944. That was the season in which, under General Eisenhower's supreme command, thousands of American, British, Canadian and other soldiers died to help rid Europe of the Nazis. Their courageous sacrifice had enormous consequences. The war ended with the Soviet empire enlarged, and the stage set for the retreat from empire of Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and, later, Portugal. The Normandy landings may be said to have marked the beginning of the end of European rule over large tracts of the planet. They also established the predominant global power of the US for the ensuing half-century. That power is now in abeyance. The self-sacrifice with which the Allies tackled Nazi Germany has been absent from their response, generations later, to Serbian expansionism in former Yugoslavia. This is explicable, if not excusable. Serbia is not poised to attack France, or Britain, or the US. Britain and France have sent low numbers of troops, some of whom have been killed; the US has sent none. The recent dissolution of the Soviet empire changed the world again, as surely as did the defeat of Nazi Germany nearly 50 previously. It reawakened America's isolationist spirit. Thus President Bill Clinton will attend the D-day commemorations as an unlikely successor to President Roosevelt and Ike, a living symbol of a United States that chooses to be impotent. The Queen will be there, representing her father's war. She will need no reminding of the declining influence of Britain since those great days. The television screens will be full of speeches, prayers, military bands, fly-pasts, marches, and pictures of the heads of state and government of what might then have been called the greater Atlantic co-prosperity sphere, but is now the disunited states of confusion. The world is no longer as dangerous as in 1944. At least the vileness of the Nazi threat has gone, for which we must be grateful. But in Britain, one of the continent's medium-sized component parts, we have not begun to comprehend where we are going. The receding generation of 'leaders' is leaving no road-maps. We have no Churchill, no Bevin to take a world-historical view of events. D-day was a bloody epic battle, led by giants. It will be commemorated by pygmies.</p>

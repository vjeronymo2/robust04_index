			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Disposal helps Marshalls to Pounds 12.4m THE SALE of a large landfill site coupled with sharply reduced interest costs helped Marshalls, the Halifax-based building materials group, report flat full-year pre-tax profits yesterday despite a 24.9 per cent decline in operating profits. The proposed final dividend is cut by 1p to 2.75p, making a reduced total of 4p (5p). The company said that was to reflect the lower operating profits and to conserve cash for the planned capital expenditure programme and new acquisitions. Pre-tax profits in the year to March 31 edged up to Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 12.3m) on turnover which fell to Pounds 169.5m (Pounds 174.4m) reflecting difficult market conditions. Earnings per share slipped to 3.93p (3.99p). Operating profits from continuing operations fell to Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 16.6m) reflecting what Mr Andrew Marshall, chairman, described as 'the great pressure on margins'. The core concrete, stone and flooring business reported profits before interest of Pounds 12m (Pounds 13.3m) on turnover which declined to Pounds 128m (Pounds 131m) including Pounds 6m from flooring operations. Sales of concrete and stone products were down 2 per cent and profits fell by 9 per cent. Clay products were also affected by severe trading conditions in the brick industry with high national stocks forcing down margins which led to capacity reduction - including a 14 per cent cut in the workforce - in November. Sales fell by 10 per cent resulting in a marginal profit of Pounds 300,000 compared with profits of Pounds 2.9m. The steep decline in overall operating profits was, however, offset by the Pounds 2.74m (Pounds 862,000) proceeds from the sale of an infill site, and lower interest charges of Pounds 2.75m (Pounds 5.1m), mainly reflecting a sharp reduction in borrowings following the group's Pounds 20m rights issue a year ago. Year-end net borrowings stood at Pounds 21.3m (Pounds 41.3m) representing gearing of 18.3 per cent, down from 42.6 per cent a year earlier. Capital expenditure was held at Pounds 5.7m during the year with several projects deferred until this year when Pounds 12m of capital expenditure is planned reflecting 'the clear opportunities for profitable organic growth.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD's Advertising Regulation Department began offering an expedited review process in February, 1991 for those members who desired review and comment of advertising and sales literature that was faster than the normal review and comment process, which is ten business days. The expedited process is completed within three business days. Over the past three years, use of the expedited process has increased far beyond the NASD's expectation. The expedited filing process has become standard operating procedure for many of the program's most frequent users and many items filed are frequently more difficult to review because they contain new concepts and approaches requiring greater time for research and analysis. The increase in the number of expedited filings has led to a significant increase in the amount of administrative processing and has made it more difficult to provide service within the ten-day turnaround time for normal filings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD is proposing an amendment to Section 13 of Schedule A to the NASD By-Laws which establishes a fee structure that will give members the ability to choose the level of service that best fits their needs, taking into consideration the costs related to that level. Each of the specific fees would be increased, including the service charge for expedited service. However, the service charge for expedited service would no longer be imposed in addition to the base service charge and the number of pages or minutes of video that triggers an additional fee would be increased,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> from 5 to 10 pages and from 5 to 10 minutes. The text of the amendment identifies each of the changes to the fees. The NASD is requesting that the amendment be implemented on May 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(5) of the Act, <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  which require that the rules of the Association provide for the equitable allocation of dues, fees and other charges among members in that the proposed rule equitably adjusts the fees assessed for the review of advertising and sales literature to accurately reflect the time spent and level of analysis performed per item submitted for review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. &sect;78o-3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments were neither solicited nor received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The foregoing rule change has become effective upon filing pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder in that it constitutes a due, fee or other charge. The rule will be implemented on May 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At any time within 60 days of the filing of a rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act, the Commission may summarily abrogate the rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Confusion over Emu timetable EUROPEAN COMMUNITY finance ministers yesterday agreed to prolong member states' economic 'convergence' programmes beyond the end of 1995, a move which leaves open the possibility of a delay in economic and monetary union. The European Commission portrayed the decision as a 'technical' matter which would set a common framework for measuring EC members' performance on inflation, budget deficits and government debt - the convergence criteria set down as conditions for Emu in the Maastricht treaty. But senior Commission officials were last night on the defensive after several EC delegations suggested that the extension of convergence programmes into 1996 could signal a delay in the Emu timetable, beyond the earliest possible date of 1997. Doubts about the convergence programmes have grown because of their deflationary impact at a time of rising unemployment, and because Germany - cornerstone of a future monetary union - does not meet the convergence criteria for Emu because of the soaring costs of unification. The Maastricht treaty leaves open the possibility of a delay until 1999. But, until recently, the Commission and Emu advocates have stressed strict convergence, with a view to early Emu - despite widespread scepticism in the financial markets and ill-disguised reservations in Germany. EC officials said the main reason for prolonging the convergence programmes lay in significant differences in national programmes. There is a need for common standards and methods for measuring readiness for Emu, they added. Confusion about a Commission retreat on Emu began to circulate at the end of a meeting of EC finance ministers in Brussels. The confusion grew after Italian, German and Luxembourg diplomats reported that several delegations had voiced disquiet about rising unemployment and poor growth prospects in the EC. A senior EC diplomat said several member states had complained that 17m people were out of work in Europe, driving up budget deficits through lost tax revenues and increasing the danger of social disorder. A senior Luxembourg diplomat suggested that the Commission had laid the groundwork for 'stretching out' the timetable for monetary union to take account of lower-than-expected growth. But Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, categorically denied it. He stressed that co-operation on a Community-wide growth initiative would increase the prospects for Emu, if possible by 1997. Mr Christophersen said that convergence programmes would continue if necessary, 'into eternity' so that all EC members would have the chance to meet the strict Emu criteria. 'We are not talking about a delay in the general process. We are talking about a common time frame.'</p>

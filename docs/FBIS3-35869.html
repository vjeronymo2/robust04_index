			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Aleksey Zhuk; from the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] [Zhuk] Myechyslaw Hryb, the new Supreme Soviet  speaker, conducted his first working meeting at the Belarus  Supreme Soviet today. It was pointed out that to all  appearances the political confrontation in the Supreme Soviet  and in the republic has somewhat lessened, but the economic  crisis is on the increase.    [Hryb] Not even one of the former USSR republics has  determined its state structure. We as such do not have one.  The old structure was destroyed but it has not been replaced by  a new one.    I will use all my efforts to establish a firm presidential  rule and, without doubts, cooperation with Russia. This does  not stand in the way of developing political and economic  relations with Western countries. One is welcome to work in  this direction but priority should be given to relations with  the Russian Federation since our roots and our economic ties are  there.</p>

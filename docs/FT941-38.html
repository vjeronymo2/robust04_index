			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Nissho Iwai warns of losses on trust, share investments Nissho Iwai, Japan's sixth-largest general trading company by sales, yesterday warned it would record extraordinary losses of Y39bn (Dollars 376.4m) during the financial year which ends today. It blamed investments in specified money trusts, securities losses, and the costs of closing businesses outside Japan. The group said it planned to offset the losses through extraordinary sales of land and securities. However, the net impact would be an extraordinary loss of Y3bn for the 1993 financial year. Post-tax profits would fall short of the Y7bn forecast, it warned. Nissho Iwai is the latest of many trading houses to announce extraordinary losses on specified money trusts. These financial instruments, known as tokkin, were an important source of income during the late 1980s. However, they have become a serious burden since the collapse of the Tokyo stock market. Sumitomo, Mitsubishi and Marubeni have each liquidated unprofitable subsidiaries and cancelled tokkin and fund trusts. Nissho Iwai said it would report a Y16bn loss on its fund trust and tokkin accounts. A further Y6bn loss would be incurred by scaling back similar investments at its subsidiary NI Finance. The remaining Y17bn would be accounted for by losses on securities and the closure of overseas operations. These would be partly offset by a Y5.1bn profit on land sold in Chiba, east of Tokyo, the sale of another plot for Y24.5bn, and Y6bn from sales of securities, it said.</p>

This betrays his sinister intention to further intensify the  maneuvers to do harm to and slay fellow countrymen in the new  year under the pretext of the North's fictitious "nuclear  development".    As already reported, both the DPRK and the United States, at  a recent contact, removed a series of hurdles in the way of the  DPRK-U.S. talks and brought a progress in the talks by showing  mutual understanding and spirit of cooperation. The outcry  obtrusively let out by the traitor Kim Yong-sam at this time  cannot but be condemned as an unpardonable, despicable  anti-national act.    He got an "assurance" from the United States to keep the  "international cooperation system" in reward for a total opening  of the rice market of South Korea during his trip to the United  States in November last year. But afraid that it may burst like  soap bubbles, he is vociferating about the "nuclear suspicion"  of the North from the first day of the new year.    This shows that the traitor Kim Yong-sam is not interested  in  the DPRK-U.S. talks at all but is working with bloodshot eyes  to torpedo the talks and inflict "sanctions" and put pressure on  the North.    No matter how desperately he is working he cannot block the  progress of the DPRK-U.S. talks whose prospects are in sight  for fundamentally settling the nuclear problem on the Korean  peninsula.    It is obtrusive of the traitor Kim Yong-sam, who has neither  a real power nor say and has been totally forsaken by the  people, to say this or that over the problem to be resolved  between the DPRK and the United States.    The people will never pardon such an out and out flunkeyist  sycophant as the traitor Kim Yong-sam who is leading the South  Korean peasants to death by opening the rice market and is  working hard to do harm to fellow countrymen through the  "international cooperative system".    The traitor Kim Yong-sam had better stop acting rashly,  clearly mindful that the road of treacheries chosen by him leads  to destruction.</p>

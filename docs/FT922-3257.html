			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Generators No doubt unwittingly, the National Audit Office's report on the privatisation of the electricity generators is as revealing as its narrow conclusions are uncontroversial. It is difficult to dispute that the sale mechanisms adopted by the Department of Energy were a success. In particular, the institutional book-building process increased the sale proceeds for taxpayers by several hundred million pounds. That helped offset costs of Pounds 80m. Taxpayers did rather less well on the issue of the companies' assets. While Pounds 110m of property was transferred out of the generators to Nuclear Power, they were left with roughly Pounds 300m of surplus property whose value was adjusted down by Pounds 74m ahead of the sale. Those assets can be sold without penalty at the end of the decade. Ahead of the sale, both generators successfully disputed the government's profit and dividend forecasts. Had the government view prevailed, the proceeds on a full sale might have been Pounds 350m higher. In the event, the government lacked confidence in its ability to obtain a fair price. Hence its decision to sell only 60 per cent of the shares. In view of the subsequent rise in power prices, that was just as well. Perhaps most importantly, the report recalls that the companies began by demanding that they be sold with cash on their balance sheets, notionally to pay for cleaning up their power station emissions. After 'prolonged negotiations,' PowerGen capitulated completely and National Power accepted Pounds 480m of debt, a figure within Pounds 50m of the government's original position. The report neglects to mention the reason why the companies reluctantly rolled over: during the dispute, minds were concentrated by the suggestion that PowerGen would be sold to Hanson. Taxpayers have one less reason to resent the latter's consummate avoidance of UK liabilities.</p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Chilean fears over anti-terrorist unit CHILE'S army is lobbying hard to be included in a new anti-terrorist unit, raising fears that the dreaded CNI, the secret police of former dictator General Augusto Pinochet, may soon be back in action. The civilian government is this week expected to announce the creation of the intelligence unit, formed from the ranks of the police. The decision to set up an anti-terrorist intelligence unit comes after four murders in as many weeks, including the assassination on April 1 of Senator Jaime Guzman, a right-wing leader and staunch defender of the 1973-90 military regime. President Patricio Aylwin's year-old civilian government has been thrown off-guard by a surge in guerrilla revenge killings since the publication of an official report last month that was highly critical of the armed forces' human rights abuses under military rule. The government says the new unit will be formed by Carabineros and Investigaciones - two police organisations which have often been at loggerheads. To dispel the spectre of a resurrected CNI, it says the new unit will be headed by a civilian in the interior ministry. Its actions will be also subject to parliamentary scrutiny. But the army is mounting a campaign to be allowed in on the act. Last week, Gen Pinochet briefed several leading congressmen, senators and government ministers on the army's experience in combatting terrorism. Retired Colonel Christian Labbe, Gen Pinochet's last government spokesman, said: 'We need a centralised intelligence unit to defeat terrorism, not two or three police groups gathering bits of information. The new unit should include the military, as they have the most experience in this matter.' The army admits that it reincorporated some 2,000 secret police agents when the CNI was disbanded shortly before Gen Pinochet stepped down from power in March 1990. It says the CNI files were destroyed. The new government was left with no intelligence arm of its own. This has led to widely different assessments of the guerrilla threat it is facing: some reports speak of a hard core of 200 extreme leftists who refused to lay down arms after democracy was restored. Others speak of up to 2,700 foreign-trained insurgents. Two groups are known to be operating in the country: a splinter of the Manuel Rodriguez Front, which claimed Senator Guzman's assassination, and a shadowy group called Lautaro, which has progressed from Robin Hood antics (distributing condoms in secondary schools and organising armed demonstrations in Santiago's shanty towns) to bombings and killing police. Both are thought to be infiltrated by ultra-right wingers linked to the former CNI.</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Arts: Inspirational images - Patricia Morison visits St Jerome the penitent in the National Gallery St Jerome's distinguishing marks in art are a cardinal's hat and a charming lion. However, as a new exhibition at London's National Gallery shows, merely being able to identify this white-bearded old saint does not take one very far. St Jerome features more often in later medieval and Renaissance art than any other personality of the Early Church. His popularity survived the Reformation. Ribera, the 17th-century saint-specialist, painted no less than 45 St Jeromes. What was it about St Jerome that for four centuries secured his honoured place in Catholic art and piety? Theme and Variations: Saint Jerome is the first of a new series of National Gallery exhibitions which will 'examine themes' in paintings within the collection - iconography, in other words. This is an extremely good idea and one becoming fashionable as museum curators try to bridge the gap between an atheistical, plain uneducated public and the standard repertoire of Christian imagery and symbolism. Not that an understanding of the repertoire is by any means the only key to the appreciation of religious art. Think of the blatantly erotic appeal of countless Venetian and Spanish images of female saints; knowing their legends or even their names hardly matters, although it may add piquancy. And yet, it would be perverse to deny that greater familiarity with iconography leads to a keener enjoyment of the Old Masters and, almost as importantly, of pedestrian or straightforwardly inept artists. At a glance we recognise St Jerome (thanks to the lion, without which we could be looking at St Augustine) as the great Doctor and Father of the western Church, working on his Latin translation of the Bible. But only certain artists could create an inspirational image - the man of intellect who, oblivious to worldly distractions, is totally wrapped up in the Word of God. Antonello da Messina was one such artist. In his perfect brown study of a painting we see St Jerome's study framed within a monumental stone arch. The scholar is seated in profile, a pose which conveys a certain hard-edged disciplined quality of mind, one strengthened by the orderly arrangement of books and implements on the shelves behind. Putting this very famous painting with another 'St Jerome in his Study' by the Venetian artist, Vincenzo Catena, helps us appreciate this far less familiar painting as another wholly successful variation on the theme. Here, too, are beautifully realised details - the slippers neatly placed by the raised platform, (did Renaissance scholars take their shoes off because they used foot-warmers?), the curtain at shoulder height to take the chill off the stone wall. Whereas Antonello put the saint's study inside a church, Vincenzo has created a real room, but made the most prominent object within it the crucifix. Head bowed on his hand, the intellectual is Christ's humble servant to Christ. Giovanni Bellini (or someone in his workshop) looks back to St Jerome's few years spent as a hermit in the Syrian desert. Here is the lion, to be sure, but not the anachronistic cardinal's hat. The saint in his sky-blue tunic is sitting on a rock, blissfully engaged in reading. However, that was Jerome on a good day in the desert. The saint's other main occupation, as he testified in his celebrated letter to Julia Eustochium, one of his female admirers, was bruising his flesh on the hard ground, fasting, letting his skin turn black as an Ethiopians and beating his breast all night as he sought to extinguish the fires of lust which still flickered in his aged loins. For Jerome, one of the early Church's most ardent proponents of chastity, the Devil lived in the loins and the navel (his euphemism for female private parts). Many of the images in the exhibition showing Jerome the penitent would, to the educated Christian who knew the letters, recall Jerome's victory over his loins. With such a rich theme and a smallish gallery, hung with no less than 16 St Jeromes (there are 30 in the Gallery) some elements are missing and there are some ellipses. It is not correct that Jerome went to the desert because of his famous dream, in which he was punished for his attachment to reading Cicero. We should have been told more about Jeronimite monasteries of the 15th century, and more about the saint as a symbol of penitence in Counter-Reformation, especially in the light of the one, quite magnificent loan to the exhibition: Georges de la Tour's 'St Jerome in Penitence' from Stockholm. This is a delightful exhibition, one ideal for children and bound to tell almost everyone something new about St Jerome. I wish we could have had at least a panel on the Jerome subjects not in the collection, for example, dictating the Vulgate to his pupils (a scene found in a delightful panel in Dublin by Niccolo Fances). And was there ever an artist who showed the scene described in the Golden Legend when the saint's enemies, determined to stop him becoming pope, left a woman's clothing on his bed? St Jerome, the absent-minded scholar, put on the dress and went to church, which dished his papal chances for ever. St Jerome the unwitting transvestite - now that would have been a spicey variation on a much-loved theme . . . Until December 13: admission free.

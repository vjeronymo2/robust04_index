			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Fashion: Unsung rag trade heroes - Avril Groom on the back room stars of the UK fashion world ANYONE with more than a passing interest in fashion will know the identity of the British Designer of the Year. But the clothing exporter of the year? Who is that? Media and public interest is invariably design-led, yet high fashion designers turning over much more than Pounds 1m are the exception in the UK. Clothing companies notching serious export success tend to be far less glamorous. Names from the heady realms of design, such as nostalgic Mulberry, menswear genius Paul Smith and cashmere leaders Pringle, have been winners but, more likely, are purveyors of men's duffle coats, inexpensive cotton separates or frilly children's wear. Yet these kind of companies are the main contributors to a total annual UK clothing export figure of more than Pounds 2bn. In spite of the recession, the figure is still increasing - albeit more slowly than in 1990. Such unsung heroes of British fashion had their moment of glory this week, at the 1992 Apparel Export Awards. Organised by the British Knitting and Clothing Export Council, an industry-funded body which promotes clothing exports by helping firms exhibit abroad and linking them with potential agents and buyers, the awards, which I helped to judge, were presented at a gala dinner in London by the council's president, the Princess Royal, who, with her no-nonsense approach to glamour, is the perfect royal patron for this cause. Choosing eight winners from 74 nominees was serious business for a judging panel drawn from journalism, industry and banking. To be eligible, a company needed to have achieved continuing export growth over the past three years, if possible to have increased its workforce and to have a clear strategy for future growth. This was not easy last year and, several firms where exports grew quickly up until 1991, reported a slowdown. Eventual winners varied from traditional outerwear firms to a glove-maker and a small-scale designer of upmarket cashmere with no formal training. Some have always pursued export markets while others have only recently altered their strategy, faced with a shrinking home market, to tackle them. Many are family-run and all share the conviction that, apart from the need for high-quality products efficiently delivered, successful exporting depends on personal contacts with, and visits to, the customers. The good designs displayed by this year's winners suggest that overseas buyers increasingly recognise that British fashion is not just about tradition but about innovative design that is also saleable. We spotlight four of the winners: Ghost, womenswear winner, is recognised as a high-fashion leader, specialising in soft, flowing shapes made from piece-dyed, Italian-woven viscose crepe which gains its character from the shrinkage induced by the dyeing process. Innovative styling has recently given the label a high media profile. The spring collection was shown in neo-hippy, grunge style but individual pieces remain comfortably wearable. London-based Ghost has increased its export sales over the past three years from Pounds 1.3m to almost Pounds 2m - they now account for 70 per cent of its total. The firm's founder and managing director, Tanya Sarne, oversees every aspect, creating the range with designer Andrea Sargeant, who lives in Italy, and a UK-based team. Married in the 1970s to the singer Mike Sarne, Tanya says she learnt then to juggle limited amounts of money. With stylish commercial acumen she has increased the turnover from Pounds 250,000 in 1985 to about Pounds 2.75m. The US now accounts for one-third of total business, followed by Scandinavia. She says: 'The secret is personalities - getting agents and customers who like and understand the clothes, which are very individual - and maintaining contact. We give an initial reply to any communication within one day and we make on-time, complete deliveries'. Dents Gloves, accessories winner, has taken exporting seriously since the arrival of managing director John Roberts three years ago. The 200-year-old company had lost its way promotionally, in spite of high-quality products, and was suffering from a fall-off in the home market. Roberts redirected the company from contract work to export, investing heavily in high-quality brochures and packaging, taking a high profile abroad at trade exhibitions and producing design innovations such as bright silk linings to raise the fashion image. The result has been an increase in exports from 14 per cent to 70 per cent of total sales. Italy, itself a byword for top-quality leather, provides the best market. Roberts is very critical of lack of government support for the industry. 'Companies get help with their first few foreign shows but that is quite inadequate to build a new market which is very expensive for small companies,' he says. 'It's typical British short-term thinking.' The support to which he refers comes from the Department of Trade and Industry and amounts to about 50 per cent of the cost of a 15 sq m exhibition stand at the exhibitor's first three appearances in any one country, or five in certain cases. The lingerie section needs retitling as the winner - H G Porter and Co  - is the first men's nightwear company to win in the awards' seven-year history. Chairman Arthur Porter, the founder's grandson, has made a 'concerted and strategic effort on export to Europe since 1989, preparing for the single market. Before that, our exporting was piecemeal, relying on chance personal contacts.' The Strabane-based firm was founded as a shirtmakers, going into nightwear through restructuring in 1965. 'We had relatively little specialist competition so there was a niche,' says Porter. 'Since then I've become obsessed with pyjamas.' The results of extensive market research in Europe led to updating a traditional British look and seeing each country as a regional variant, not a different market. Exports have almost doubled in two years and he has taken on 30 extra employees. He credits his workforce, the BKCEC and the Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board. Belinda Robertson wins the Natwest Award for small businesses with her Pounds 440,000 sales of which almost 90 per cent are exported. Her cashmere design firm started almost by accident when she modelled knitwear and thought the designs boring, sketched some ideas of her own and found she could sell them. She moulds and drapes cashmere so it looks more like woven fabric, a style with upmarket success especially in the US. She says the secret is 'all in the contacts - through them I show abroad privately, which is what top-level customers like.' She also finds her Edinburgh base an advantage - 'customers are delighted to visit because they can take in a little golf and tourism.'</p>

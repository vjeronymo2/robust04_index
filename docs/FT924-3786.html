			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Nu-Swift falls to Pounds 2.52m Nu-Swift, the fire protection, office services and property group, is paying no interim dividend because its distributable reserves have dried up after it had to cover exchange losses on loans from one of its subsidiaries. The group paid a 10p interim last time. In the six months to June 30, pre-tax profits were Pounds 2.52m (Pounds 11.35m) on turnover of Pounds 154.5m (Pounds 165.7m). Earnings per share fell to 5.09p (17.04p). Operating profit for the service businesses, which contributed 96 per cent of turnover, rose to Pounds 7.38m (Pounds 5.91m). But this was offset by the impact of property investments, especially interest charges of Pounds 4.16m, compared with Pounds 5.68m receivable and the write-off in its London Securities investment, the property and investment group. There were also currency losses of Pounds 1.2m.</p>

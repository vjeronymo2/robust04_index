			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Sharpe &amp; Fisher continues recovery SHARPE &amp; FISHER, the building supplies and property company, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 420,000 for the half year to end-June. Sales rose by Pounds 728,000 to Pounds 22.1m. The outcome compared with losses of Pounds 436,000 in last year's first half; the company returned to the black in the second six months. The main reason for the upturn was the turnround in the building supplies division, which achieved profits of Pounds 319,000 against a loss of Pounds 252,000. Property also improved with a 13.5 per cent increase to Pounds 771,000. Earnings emerged at 1.5p per share (1.4p losses) and the interim dividend is unchanged at 1.5p. Mr Charles Fisher, chairman and chief executive, said he had no reason to be opti-mistic about the prospect of economic recovery in the short term. Interest rates were still too high to promote any improvement in sales, he added.</p>

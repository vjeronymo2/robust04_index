			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Fire strike averted by 1.4% wage settlement LOCAL government employers yesterday announced a 1.4 per cent pay rise for firefighters under their wage formula, ending the threat of a strike this autumn, Robert Taylor writes. The settlement is lower than the government's 1.5 per cent public-sector pay limit and adds Pounds 4.50 to the present Pounds 305 a week basic rate of firefighters. The Fire Brigades Union had been warning of conflict if the pay formula that links their members' pay to the upper quartile of male manual earnings was not honoured.</p>

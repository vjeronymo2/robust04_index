			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Engineers fear body blow from steel prices: EC ministers will hear angry voices from the UK SMALL AND medium-sized British engineering companies are becoming increasingly worried that an increase in steel prices of as much as 40 per cent this year could endanger or postpone their recovery from the recession. As European Community ministers meet in Brussels today to study the next steps in the restructuring plan for the EC steel industry, angry UK steel users are complaining that price increases are having damaging knock-on effects for UK manufacturing. They say that the rises threaten to stoke up inflation and hasten the return of a 'boom and bust' economy. In particular, small companies are worried about being squeezed between large steel suppliers and powerful end-users of their products - such as vehicle makers or retailers - who refuse to accept any price increase. This sentiment was supported by Mr Ray Gore, group purchasing director at Wells-based Clares Equipment, which makes trolleys and shelves for supermarkets. Mr Norman Gledhill, executive director of the Mechanical and Metal Trades Confederation (Metcom), said that price increases in basic raw materials such as the latest steel price rises 'do very little to help the competitiveness of British engineering in the attack on valuable export markets.' But the steel industry has strongly defended the price rises. British Steel pointed out that the increases had not fully recouped - even in nominal terms - the reductions in prices suffered by producers since 1990. British Steel said prices for strip products had fallen by as much as 35 per cent until the start of the recent round of increases. Implementation of a 9 per cent increase on July 4 will bring the increase since then to 19 per cent. Smaller steel users say their own big customers benefited most from the price reductions of 1990-1992. They are now blocking attempts by suppliers to pass the increases on - in fear of damaging their own fragile prospects of recovery. Mr Terry Barnes, managing director of Deeside-based Dixon-Bate, has written to the prime minister about the steel price rises. Dixon-Bate, which makes towing equipment, buys about five tonnes a month of flat steel and sections from a stockholder which itself is supplied by Allied Steel &amp; Wire in Cardiff. Mr Barnes says he has had to weather four price increases, totalling 40 per cent, so far this year. 'I've only been able to pass on a price increase of about 2 per cent,' he said. Dixon-Bate is considering buying East European steel instead, and Mr Barnes has told ASW that a 40 per cent price increase will kill UK demand. In reply ASW has told Mr Barnes that it is highly likely that selling prices for its steel sections will be less this year than they were in 1990 and little more than 5 per cent higher than they were in 1985. The price rises are also hitting medium-sized companies. Mr James Watson, managing director of South Yorkshire-based Coltran Products, has had to accept a 6 per cent - or Pounds 22 a tonne - increase in the price of mild steel rod it buys from a number of stockists which are supplied by British Steel. Coltran is the UK's largest manufacturer of laundry airers and buys 1,200-1,400 tonnes of steel a year. Mr Watson said he did not expect to be able to pass the increase on to his customers, which include big retailers, and it would be difficult to recoup the increases from any further internal productivity improvements. 'We've moved towards becoming the low-cost producer, and we've taken market share from competitors. But, coming out of the recession there are two things that matter: cashflow, and having the funds to invest,' he said. Further steel price rises are considered likely in the autumn but the European steel industry is adamant that it needs the increases to recoup the heavy losses of the past two years. The rises follow production cuts of 15 per cent to 20 per cent across Europe in the final quarter of last year. Price increases have also been fuelled by strong demand from China.</p>

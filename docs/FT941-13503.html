			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Barlow to sell remaining stake in Randgold Barlow, the rump of South Africa's former Barlow Rand conglomerate, is offering to sell by tender its remaining 27 per cent stake in mining subsidiary Randgold and Exploration as the group puts the finishing touches to the re-organisation it started last year. The holding is worth nearly R80m (Dollars 23.5m) at current market prices. Barlow was South Africa's flagship industrial group before it disposed of its foods and electronics interests in an unbundling exercise formally completed earlier this month. The group has long stated its intention of disposing of Randgold, whose four marginal gold mines and parcel of mineral rights were not seen as a long-term investment. Speculation as to who will pick up the shares on offer centres on S. G. Warburg subsidiary Mercury Asset Management, which is understood to have built up a 28 interest in Randgold in recent weeks. Plans by Randgold management to go ahead with a controversial share incentive scheme, offering employees stock in the company at a generous discount to market prices, were significantly amended at the company's general meeting last week after Mercury said it would oppose the offer. Randgold's mines turned in a disappointing performance in the quarter to December, reporting an aggregate R17.29m loss, but as marginal producers they are highly geared to any significant recovery in gold prices. Mr Warren Clewlow, Barlow chairman, told shareholders at the group's general meeting yesterday that the Randgold transaction should be completed next month. Talks about selling a large stake in Barlow's computing subsidiary Persetech, the local distributor of Hitachi equipment, to an outside consortium were at an advanced stage. Mr Clewlow added that the reconstituted Barlow - whose interests include UK subsidiaries Stratford and Bibby, which is on the verge of a London flotation - traded 'satisfactorily' in the first quarter to end-December without elaborating further. On a pro-forma basis, Barlow would have reported pre-tax profit of R578m in the year to September 30 on sales of R12.3bn compared R763m on sales of R11.2bn the previous year.</p>

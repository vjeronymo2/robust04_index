			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Electoral Tribunal President Eduardo Valdes </F> Escoffery and Electoral Delegate President Juan Francisco de la  Guardia by Octavio Cogley at the ATLAPA Convention Center  Election Media Center in Panama City -- live]    [Text] [Cogley] We are here with Electoral Tribunal [TE]  President Mr. Eduardo Valdes Escoffery and also Electoral  Delegate President Juan Francisco de la Guardia. Welcome  gentlemen. We are witnessing the conclusion of the voting phase  of the election process. I understand that only those voters  who were in line when the voting process ended and those members  of the various boards related to the election process will be  allowed to vote from here on. Let us listen to Magistrate  Valdes Escoffery comments on the significance of these  elections, in which we have been able to witness that the  Panamanian people have conducted themselves very peacefully, and  that the elections so far have proceeded very normally.    [Valdes] Well, first of all, as Panamanians, we are really  delighted with the degree of patience, tolerance, aptitude, and  ability to fraternize with each other that the political  adversaries have demonstrated. We have seen all of them in  action. They have all been very cooperative. Men, women, even  the children who had their own special elections. Even they had  long lines at their respective voting centers. Incredibly, even  senior citizens went to vote and where patient enough when their  voting tables were not located on a ground floor. Some of these  senior citizens even went to vote with their walkers.    Practically, no one has complained about the organization.  We have received numerous congratulations. The mood has been  festive and everyone has shared in this mood. This really has  no precedence. We were just commenting that we would be waking  up in a different country. I believe that we all feel the same.  We must all feel quite delighted. Let us hope that those  limited defects that took place in some areas were finally  overcome and we will be able to implement whatever corrective  measures the law specifies in a civilized manner as occurs in  every election process.    I have been able to participate in numerous elections during  the past year since we are currently undergoing a wave of  democratic renovation. Even in Chile, a country with a very  long cultural tradition, I was at a voting center where the  voting table could open because the party poll representatives  had not shown up. In Chile, party poll representatives hold  their positions for a fixed period, and they had just had a  turnover and the new representatives were not familiar with  their responsibilities, and they were just discussing how to  operate the voting table. In other words, every election  process has some confusion. Let us hope that what we have all  seen and shared today can be understood in the tolerant manner  we have demonstrated so far.    [Cogley] Mr. Juan Francisco de la Guardia, do you agree with  the statements by the TE magistrate? Has everything proceeded  normally? Have there been any problems? You were responsible  for coordinating everything related to the electoral delegates.  In addition to that, you were also involved in supervising that  the election process would proceed normally.    [De la Guardia] Not only has it proceeded normally, it has  also been an extraordinary example of civic conscience by the  Panamanian people. It was really amazing how the people showed  up to vote beginning very early in the morning. The voting  centers were crowded beginning at 0630 and 0700. It was  incredible how the people went to their respective voting  centers and how great was their desire to cast their votes.  They were eager to express their opinion through their votes.  This is the way we have always wanted it to be in our country.  We have had an election festival.    [Cogley] Well, Mr. Magistrate President, thank you very much  for your comments.</p>

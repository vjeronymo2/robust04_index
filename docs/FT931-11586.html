			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Arts: Elgar's Lux Christi - Concert One of the passing benefits that accrue from the present fashion for recording entire areas of a composer's output is that live concerts often include rarities which one would not otherwise hear. Over the past couple of years Richard Hickox has been working through Elgar's oratorios and he has now reached obscure territory. The latest instalment is Lux Christi, or 'The Light of Life', as Elgar's publishers preferred to call it. Timed with an eye on the market-place, where Hickox's recording of Caractacus has just arrived this month, Sunday's performance at the Barbican could well win supporters for a work that has been so overshadowed by the masterpieces that followed as almost to disappear into oblivion - a forgotten prototype for the fully-finished product. Elgar remarked in later life that Lux Christi had been conceived against the odds, by a poor wretch teaching all day, resigned to composing after dinner with a splitting headache. But, he added, the 'spirit and will' were there. That shows through not in any tangible sense of resolve, for the music lacks direction and its quality is up-and-down, but in its very personal tone. This is a score which searches deep in its soul for what it wants to say at its finest moments. In this performance those almost always occured when Jesus was singing, in the person of the bass John Shirley-Quirk. His magnanimity of utterance and long-breathed vocal lines remain as imposing as ever. Arthur Davies sang the blind man who is restored to sight, not without some constriction in the voice, though he has both the outgoing romantic ardour and the quiet sense of wonder for the music. Judith Howarth was the soprano Mother; Linda Finnie the contralto Narrator. The choruses are not the work's strength. Elgar was still feeling his way towards the grand structures that crown his mature oratorios, but the London Symphony Chorus concealed howfour-square much of the writing is with their sheer energy. Hickox himself, conducting an attentive London Symphony Orchestra, still rushes at climaxes, which arrive in a few bars rather than over several pages, as they should; but his passionate Elgar is preferable to the old, sedate style. Unlike its successors, Lux Christi is short enough to allow another piece in the first half of a concert. On Sunday, that should have been Maria Joao Pires in what one imagines would have been a deeply-considered performance of Beethoven's 'Emperor' Piano Concerto, but Pires was ill and her place was taken by Jon Kimura Parker - ruthlessly exact, a brilliant organiser of the pianistic effects that make the surface of this concerto sparkle, but not often more.</p>

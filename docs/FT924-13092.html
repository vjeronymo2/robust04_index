			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Rivals in Angola near compromise THE TWO sides in Angola's political crisis were moving towards a compromise yesterday, easing fears of a return to civil war. Details of the deal, based on an interim government of national unity pending a second-round runoff of presidential elections, will be hammered out in a meeting in the next 48 hours between President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Mr Jonas Savimbi, leader of the Unita rebel movement. The initiative results from intense diplomatic activity by South Africa, the United Nations and the US and follows the release of election returns showing Mr dos Santos had failed to secure the 50 per cent majority to avoid a runoff. Final official results of the country's first democratic elections will be published this morning and are expected to show Mr dos Santos won 49.5 per cent of the vote against 40.6 per cent for Mr Savimbi. In the parliamentary poll the ruling MPLA won a decisive victory. The results, which overturned earlier figures showing Mr Dos Santos above the 50 per cent mark, came after a recount of the blank and void ballot papers. Mr Savimbi plunged Angola into crisis two weeks ago when he claimed the government had rigged the elections. He withdrew his generals from the newly unified Angolan Armed Forces and made veiled threats of a return to war. An investigation into the elections turned up evidence of irregularities and incompetence but failed to support Mr Savimbi's allegations of massive fraud. Diplomats said yesterday the deal between the president and the guerrilla chief had pulled the country back from the brink of renewed conflict. But they also said it left the deeply divided country in limbo and uncertain of how Mr Savimbi would act in coming months. It is unlikely a second round of presidential elections can be organised within the 30-day period laid down by the electoral laws, and Unita is certain to demand that the UN plays a bigger role in fresh elections. Unita officials and Mr Pik Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, have also said the UN, not the government, must control the election machinery for fresh polls.</p>

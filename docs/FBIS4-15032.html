			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Leonid Krutakov "Military Review": "Order to the Troops: </F> `The Fall Is To Be Considered the Spring!'"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Minister Not Waiting  for "Demobilization" Order. He Is in No Hurry    The main event of the past week did not happen -- Pavel  Grachev did not sign the latest order for the discharge to the  reserve and the new military draft. It was noted at the Defense  Ministry Collegium session that it was only thanks to the fact  that the "fall '93" draft had been extended through spring 1994  that it had finally been possible to achieve an 80-percent level  of manpower acquisition for the Army. It is not being ruled out  that in the future the trivial division of the year into spring,  summer, fall, and winter may be marked by an order from the  military department. That is nothing surprising if we are  allowing ourselves to arbitrarily wind the hands of the clock on  the Spasskaya Tower backward and forward.    The explanation of the draft situation given to us at the  Defense Ministry was that an edict had not yet been issued by  the commander in chief. But the secretariat of the commander in  chief -- who recently returned from Sochi -- replied that all  the documents are being prepared as before by the military  department.</p>

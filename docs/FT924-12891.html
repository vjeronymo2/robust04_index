			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / EC budget talks reopen EC finance ministers will today reopen detailed discussion of the Community budget, amid growing concern that governments are growing no closer to solving Europe's fundamental economic problems. The ministers will consider the outcome of last Friday's emergency summit of EC leaders, who avoided in-depth debate on the EC's economic difficulties - the original catalyst for the Birmingham meeting - in favour of a broad declaration pledging greater openness and democracy. On a more optimistic note, British officials hope today's meeting in Luxembourg will produce at least one prize for the UK's troubled presidency of the Community - a formal accord on value added tax (VAT) and excise duties across the EC. By last Friday intensive bilateral discussions between member states had almost eliminated the tiny objections which prevented unanimous agreement on the package in July. Discussion on the Delors II package of 1993-97 budget measures will revolve around the practical application of the cohesion fund, aimed at bringing poorer member states' economies into line with those of the wealthy EC countries. Ministers will try to decide how strictly to apply the conditions for cohesion funding, which is available to member states with a per capita gross national product of less than 90 per cent of the Community average - provided they take firm action to improve their economic performance. The Commission, backed by the poorer countries, is suggesting that such conditions should not be applied until three years after the fund is established. Ministers will also discuss how the funds should be distributed and the sort of projects which might be eligible for funding.</p>

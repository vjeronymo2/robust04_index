			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'VANITIES' STARTS A BRONX BONFIRE;  </P> <P> MOVIES: THE SHOOTING OF THE TOM WOLFE NOVEL IS CREATING A STIR. THE BOROUGH  PRESIDENT WANTS THE FILM TO CARRY A DISCLAIMER.  </P> <P> Mostly the news seemed typical for a day in this city. A taxi driver had been  shot -- the latest in a string of cabbie shootings and murders in the Bronx.  Also, a policeman had been wounded as he and a suspect exchanged gunfire on a  Bronx street.  </P> <P> But the really big news -- the buzz that landed on Page One last Thursday --  was that the highest elected official in the Bronx was screaming bloody murder.  His beef? The movie version of Tom Wolfe's best-selling novel "The Bonfire of  the Vanities," currently filming in New York locations. Borough President  Fernando Ferrer claimed the movie will give his hometown a bad image because it  depicts the northern-most section of New York as a place of fear, crime and  murder. "Bronx bashing," he called it.  </P> <P> His comments made the headlines. "Bronx Cheer for 'Bonfire,' " shouted the New  York Post. "Bronx Burns Over 'Bonfire,' " read the Daily News banner. The more  sedate New York Times described the entire debate as "a bonfire of inanities."  </P> <P> The Warner Bros.-distributed film, starring Tom Hanks, Bruce Willis, Morgan  Freeman and Melanie Griffith, is based on the novel that searingly pierces the  high life and low life of New York. Director Brian De Palma may have filmed  only two days on Bronx locations last week (Monday and Tuesday), but those two  days generated enough publicity for 10 motion pictures. Put briefly, the  Bronx-generated bonfire had become the right stuff for, well, a Tom Wolfe  novel.  </P> <P> "Bonfire" contrasts New York's wealthy, extravagant Wall Streeters with the  city's legions of poor, homeless and otherwise down-and-out. Hanks' protagonist  "Master of the Universe" broker Sherman McCoy confronts the dangerous side of  the Bronx one night when he is involved in a traffic accident there.  </P> <P> Until last week "Bonfire" had been shooting under secrecy at the Astoria  Studios complex in Queens. But when production moved to the Bronx, the young,  politicly ambitious Ferrer -- widely regarded here as a potential candidate for  mayor of New York -- came out swinging against the movie. Ferrer wanted the  film, slated for a December release, to carry a seven-line disclaimer over  scenes showing some positive aspects of life in the Bronx.  </P> <P> On Monday, however, Warner Bros. and the film's co-producer, Fred C. Caruso,  said they had rejected Ferrer's demand, but offered instead an altered  disclaimer. The wording they suggested reads: "This motion picture is a work of  fiction and is not intended to reflect actual events or conditions in the  localities portrayed."  </P> <P> The Warner statement followed one by New York Mayor David Dinkins. He  acknowledged Ferrer's right to voice his opinion, but drew the distinction that  it doesn't reflect the city's. "I have conveyed to him my concern for his  attempt to interfere with the project," Dinkins said. "The city would never  consider requesting a painter, author or playwright to alter or to add to an  artistic creation. Filmmaking is no different."  </P> <P> A spokesman for Ferrer said the president's office "never expected the  filmmakers to budge. We knew all along that once they were ready to leave town,  they'd drop it." The spokesman said that the wording remains substantially the  same as what Warners offered last week and it is still "unacceptable."  </P> <P> As for Wolfe himself, his representatives were telling the press on Monday that  he had no comment for the moment and that he had not read the screenplay of his  book.  </P> <P> When Ferrer first issued his demand for a disclaimer last Tuesday he had a  built-in audience. The media was already at the vintage 1933 Bronx County  Courthouse, where Ferrer's offices are, to observe the shooting of exterior  scenes and catch glimpses of the stars.  </P> <P> Ferrer told the local press that he had a big problem with the script he had  been given to read. He charged that "Bonfire," in several scenes, "goes out of  its way to denigrate the Bronx . . . using what I believe is racially explosive  language."  </P> <P> "Bonfire" co-producer Caruso disputed Ferrer's claims that the movie singled  out the Bronx, saying he and De Palma are making a film "about real life in New  York City." He further likened Ferrer's "demands" to "those of a terrorist."  </P> <P> Caruso, who had met with Ferrer twice last week, said the two are still on  speaking terms even though Caruso said he rejected as "unacceptable" the  disclaimer showing scenes of the Bronx. "I even thanked him for the publicity,"  Caruso added.  </P> <P> Among the topics at the two meetings was a reported $10,000 donation that both  sides deny suggesting. Jaynne Keyes, the director of the Mayor's Office for  Film, Theater and Broadcasting, said the idea appeared to come from a Ferrer  aide and was intended as one way that Warner Bros. might assist a worthy cause  in the Bronx. Ferrer later rejected the money, saying that his "silence can't  be bought."  </P> <P> In an interview with The Times at his office, Ferrer said, "I'm not saying,  'don't tell your story.' But it's not unreasonable to ask for 10 seconds at the  end of the movie." Ferrer cited as an example the 1981 20th Century Fox film  "Fort Apache -- The Bronx," in which a disclaimer was inserted at the film's  beginning, following a public outcry by residents of the borough over the  violent images in the film.  </P> <P> "We're attempting to rebuild this borough," Ferrer added. He noted that the 1.2  million Bronx residents run the range of economic levels and that the local  government has been successful in building about 20,000 new housing units in  the last few years.  </P> <P> As an example of what he termed the movie's distortion, Ferrer said the  filmmakers had wanted to apply graffiti to the walls of the county courthouse  for the two days of shooting. But he put a stop to that.  </P> <P> "This building hasn't had graffiti for three years -- as long as I've been in  office."  </P></p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Call to merge co-operative retailers Co-operative retailers should merge into a single national organisation, which would be one of the UK's largest retailers with annual turnover of Pounds 7bn, the Co-operative Congress was told. Speaking in the 150th year and in the birthplace of the co-operative movement - Rochdale, greater Manchester - Mr Hughie Todner, president of the congress, backed calls for co-operative societies to join forces. He said the 41 remaining societies should come together in a new Co-operative Consumer Partnership. The Co-op's financial institutions, the Co-operative Insurance Society and the Co-operative Bank, should also merge. 'The combined resources and enterprise of these organisations could forge new horizons in co-operation which could reach new heights of excellence,' he said. His call is likely to increase the pressure on the movement's two largest retailers, Co-operative Retail Services and the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which are in negotiations after the CRS launched a new proposal for a merger of the two earlier this month. That would form a group with annual sales of Pounds 3bn, making it the UK's seventh-largest retailer, and is seen as a first step towards a single co-operative organisation. The latest of three attempts to merge the two groups failed in 1990 when they could not agree on the composition of the board. But both groups are hopeful of success this time, and changes in their structure in the past four years could make agreement easier. Analysts say a merger is the only way for co-operative retailers to compete effectively in a mature grocery market increasingly dominated by large quoted companies such as J Sainsbury and Tesco. The CWS has absorbed a number of smaller regional societies in recent years, and has formed a buying and distribution partnership - the Co-operative Retail Trading Group - with several others. Mr Todner told the congress that a national partnership would create greater financial rewards for members and staff, but it was important to safeguard the movement's system of democratic control. 'A Co-operative Consumer Partnership must ensure that the ordinary rank-and-file members are given an opportunity of playing a positive role in the success of their society, and where accountability is in the controlling hands of its local members,' he said.</p>

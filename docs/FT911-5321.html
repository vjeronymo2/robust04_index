			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / TSB winds down mortgage lender MORTGAGE EXPRESS, the TSB Group's centralised mortgage lending arm established in 1986, is to withdraw from the market with the loss of about 40 sales jobs. The move follows two months of unsuccessful attempts to sell the company, which has a mortgage book of around Pounds 3bn. Mortgage Express was one of the fastest-growing of the new lenders at the height of the housing boom in 1988, but last year it slipped into an undisclosed loss after making bad-debt provisions of Pounds 8m. These accounted for two-thirds of TSB's total provision against bad debts on its retail banking operations. Mortgage Express employs 420 people and is believed to be the third largest of the centralised lending companies. Mr Hywel Luke, managing director, is among the 40 members of Mortgage Express's 420 staff being made redundant immediately. Most of the others belong to the company's sales force. Although many insurance companies and foreign banks have placed their mortgage businesses on the market in the last year, several - including Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce which had a book of about Pounds 2bn - have been unable to find buyers. However, the decision to wind down a business as large as Mortgage Express is unprecedented in the industry. Mr Hamish Paton, TSB managing director for banking services, said the group would now sell its mortgages through TSB Mortgages, its other property-based lending subsidiary with a book of about Pounds 3.8m, via its branch network. Mortgage Express's mortgages were distributed through 30 life assurance companies. The closure is not expected to incur extraordinary expenses on TSB's balance sheet when its interim results are announced in June. More jobs will be shed at intervals as Mortgage Express's operations contract in size over the next year or two. Pulling the plug, Page 18</p>

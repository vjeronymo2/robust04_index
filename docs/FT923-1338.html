			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Survey of Georgia and Atlanta (11): A little less moonlight  -Martin Dickson finds a state full of modern tourist attractions THERE can be few better ways to appreciate the importance of tourism to the Georgian economy than to enter the lobby of Atlanta's Marriott Marquis hotel early one morning and gaze upward into its enormous atrium. The floors recede upward into the ether in a series of serried, circular balconies, their 1,674 rooms ready to disgorge the day's supply of conventioneers (readily identified by their badges), business people and holiday-makers. Glass lifts, ribbed with lights, race up and down, giving a carnival touch to the otherwise coldly impersonal feel of the building. Ranks of porters stand by the checkin desk, ready to jump when needed Tourism has been big business in Atlanta since the 1960s, when the city made an effort to attract conventioneers by capitalising on its position as the communications hub of the American South. The Atlanta Hyatt hotel - the first, daring American exponent of the now-common atrium hotel design - dates from then Tourism is also an important money earner in the rest of the state. An unusually wide range of attractions offer the holiday-maker the mountain country of north Georgia, the beautiful ante-bellum towns of the piedmont, the steamy romance of coastal Savannah and the state's fine beaches. The 1996 Olympics will give a big impetus to the tourist industry, both immediately - given the huge number of visitors the games will attract  - and over the longer term, as television beams the state's attractions into homes around the world, along with the athletic events. One of the main reasons Atlanta was able to attract the Olympics is its hotel capacity. This currently totals about 53,000 rooms, with another 9,000 or so expected by 1996. About 10,000 are in the city's downtown area, close to Atlanta's main convention and sports centres, with another large complex a few miles to the north of the city, in the very well-heeled suburb of Buckhead. But Georgia's tourism industry cannot afford complacency. The immediate question is how fast the convention business is likely to grow over the next few years, having been relatively flat while the US has been in recession. Civic leaders express some concern over the appearance of some older parts of downtown Atlanta - still a little scruffy, despite the recent building of Underground Atlanta, an imaginative shopping complex, and the nearby Coca-Cola Museum. These have helped restore some gloss to the older central city. That said, by the standards of most American cities central Atlanta is relatively clean and well-maintained. But it is not a city for pedestrian sight-seeing. As in most of the 'sunbelt' cities, the automobile rules - and Atlanta lacks the dramatic character of New York or the obvious charm of San Francisco, the cities which are its two big rivals in the convention business. Atlanta now ranks number three, but its Convention and Visitors Bureau says the city hopes to overtake New York for the number two position. New York may have been given a lift by this year's Democratic Party Convention (as Atlanta was in 1988), but the bureau argues that New York's high labour costs and hotel taxes are likely to drive business in the direction of cheaper Atlanta. Statistics certainly suggest continued expansion in Atlanta's convention business: The number has grown from 1,200 in 1984, with delegate expenditure of Dollars 449m, to 1,728 in 1990, with some Dollars 1.1bn of spending - and the World Congress Centre, which is near downtown Atlanta and will form part of the Olympic games complex, is booked for conventions and exhibitions to beyond the year 2000. The recent opening of the huge Georgia Dome, which stands nearby, gives the city additional convention space, though this also doubles as the home of Atlanta's football team, the Falcons, and as an entertainment centre. The Olympic basketball and gymnastics events will be held here. Atlanta dominates Georgia's tourism: 36 per cent of the Dollars 10.4bn spent by visitors in 1991, according to a study for the state's Department of Tourism. The northwest Georgia mountains region and the coastal region centred on Savannah each contribute about 13 per cent. Atlanta's tourist attractions are almost diametrically opposed to what you might expect in the self-proclaimed capital of the south. There is little or nothing of the moonlight, magnolia and southern ante-bellum romance associated with the city in Margaret Mitchell's novel, Gone With The Wind. There is, however, plenty of that elsewhere in Georgia - be it in Savannah, with its old colonial squares and moss-covered trees, or in the graceful ante-bellum towns of Athens, home of the University of Georgia, and in Milledgeville, Georgia's former capital). Atlanta's attractions are decidedly modern - a fact neatly symbolised in the 'Southern Heritage' section of a bookshop in Buckhead's big Lenox Square shopping mall. Nestling next to Gone With The Wind is a copy of the Factory Outlet Guide to the South - an up-to-the-minute analysis of bargain shopping spots. The city's new architecture is one of its appeals. A spate of building in the 1980s has left a much more dramatic, post-modern skyline. The new IBM tower in mid-town is particularly handsome, as is the nearby, widely praised High Museum of Art, built on a smaller scale and in very different style. The recently opened Coca-Cola museum (an uncritical monument to one of the city's most celebrated companies) is largely devoted to exhibiting marketing strategies down the generations. Children, surprisingly, may find it rather boring - except for a final, magnificent room, where free Coke is dispensed by glitzy machines which throw the liquid into an arc before it enters your cup. Nothing could be further removed from this commercialism than the Martin Luther King centre, just east of downtown Atlanta. It honours the great civil rights leader who was born in the city, and had his headquarters here for much of the movement's existence.</p>

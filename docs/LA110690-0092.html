			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROUP CLAIMS 7 BROKE LAW ON CAMPAIGN GIFTS  </P> <P> Responding to a Los Angeles Times story, Common Cause has filed a complaint  with the Federal Election Commission accusing seven wealthy campaign  contributors of violating a federal election law that prohibits anyone from  making more than $25,000 a year in contributions to federal candidates.  </P> <P> In a letter to FEC Chairwoman Lee Ann Elliott, Common Cause President Fred  Wertheimer called on the commission to "take appropriate action against these  individuals and to institute procedures by which the FEC can regularly detect  such violations."  </P> <P> The Times reported in a story published April 18 that the FEC had failed to  take action against at least 10 wealthy men and women who appeared to have  exceeded the limit on contributions during 1988.  </P> <P> The seven contributors named in the Common Cause complaint were corporate  buy-out specialists Henry R. Kravis, Ronald O. Perelman and Harold Simmons;  Kravis' father, Raymond; Ira Riklis, son of corporate raider Meshulam Riklis;  Dwayne O. Andreas, chairman of Archer Daniels Midland, and his wife, Dorothy  Inez.  </P> <P> The three others named in the Times story were Meshulam Riklis, New York  developer Donald Trump and Rose Hunt, heir to the Hunt oil fortune. Common  Cause did not explain why these names were not included in the complaint.  </P> <P> FEC officials have acknowledged that they do not adequately monitor compliance  with the limits on campaign spending. Although a few people have been fined in  the past for exceeding these limits, the penalties levied in these cases have  not exceeded $250.  </P> <P> Wertheimer noted that both the Times story and the Common Cause complaint were  drawn from candidate reports currently on file at the FEC headquarters.  </P> <P> Under federal election law, contributors are permitted to give up to $2,000 to  a congressional campaign, $5,000 a year to a political action committee and  $20,000 a year to a party committee. But total contributions in any calendar  year may not exceed $25,000.  </P></p>

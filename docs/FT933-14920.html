			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Survey of Belgium (2): Export fall fuels recession - Economy hit hard by general EC climate BELGIUM'S high productivity and export-oriented economy is suffering from recession among its partners, a sharp downturn at home, and the unsustainable expense of a huge government debt equivalent to about 125 per cent of its national output. Yet it is also well positioned to reap rewards from its franc fort policy, linking the Belgian franc to the D-Mark. This tie, tenaciously maintained for the past three years, makes the Belgian government even more determined to link up in monetary union with its neighbours, especially after the European currency chaos of last autumn. From 1988, Belgium enjoyed three years of high, non-inflationary growth, peak private investment and good corporate profitability, along with big increases in disposable income. But the more than 4 per cent of gross domestic product average growth of 1988-90 slowed to 1.9 per cent in 1991 and just 0.8 per cent last year. This year is likely to see a contraction of about 0.7 per cent, and only a slow pick-up of around 1 per cent of GDP is foreseen for 1994. At home, demand has fallen; new car registrations for the first three months of this year, for instance, were down 19.4 per cent on the same period last year. But this is more due to the general climate of EC-wide recession and rising unemployment. In Belgium, there is no 'debt deflation' brake holding back a rise in consumption as there is in the UK and Scandinavia. On the contrary, the size and rate of household and corporate savings is high. The determining factor in Belgium's recession is the slowdown in its export markets. Its exports are equivalent to about two thirds of its GDP, and nearly two thirds of its sales abroad are to its neighbours in Germany, France and the Netherlands, all in recession. In addition, Belgium's relative dependence on what it earns in the international marketplace is far greater than any of these main partners; per capita it exports nearly twice the amount Germany does. Export success had fuelled high growth, particularly following German reunification. But the extent of German economic contraction has hit Belgium hard. Germany 'delayed the recession for Belgium', says Mr Alfons Verplaetse, the central bank governor. The poor outlook for exports has led to annual investment growth coming down from more than 15 per cent three years ago to perhaps minus 2 per cent this year. Company bankruptcies in the first six months this year reached a record 3,079, 35 per cent up on the same period in 1991, when the first signs of a slowdown appeared. Last year also saw the first volume fall in exports since 1975, and a 1.4 per cent drop in foreign sales at current prices. All this has fed through into lost jobs, with unemployment rising from 9.3 per cent in 1991, to an expected 11.9 per cent this year. With the franc pegged to the D-Mark, a collateral and dangerous problem has been the higher rate of wage increases in Belgium over the past three years, creating a 4 per cent wage gap with its three main trading partners. Belgium is the last EC country (aside from Luxembourg with which it has an economic union) to retain automatic wage indexation, leading over the past three years to nominal wage rises nearly twice the rate of inflation, now at around 2.8 per cent. While wage settlements have generaly been around or below German levels, the OECD reckons that in 1988-1994, Belgian wages will have risen by 38 per cent, against 30 per cent in France, and 28 per cent in the Netherlands. 'The government has been very slow to recognise that problem,' says Mr Peter Praet, chief economist at Generale de Banque, the leading commercial bank. 'It is very clear that in Belgium we have a very deep crisis, in industrial employment, not in services,' acknowledges Mr Verplaetse. A vain attempt to end wage indexation nearly brought Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene's Centre-Left government down in March. Instead, BFr10bn revenue from fuel taxes on non-industrial users are to be mobilised to lighten the high social security charges on employers in the traded goods sector of the economy. This redistribution of the tax burden - the so-called Maribel plan - should close about 40 per cent of the wage gap, according to Mr Verplaetse, provided it can be repeated next year and in 1995. The other vital ingredients to retain Belgium's competitive edge are wage moderation and a concerted effort to bring the budget deficit and government debt under control. Recent signs that wage settlements were easing are already looking ephemeral. Most unions at national level had agreed not to seek real wage increases in 1993-94. But subsequent negotiations at sectoral level have secured rises - after inflation which is automatically added in - of between 1.4 and 3.4 per cent in 14 industries. Moreover, the higher fuel charges in the Maribel plan will also go into the retail price index and therefore back into wages. The plan may not have as much effect as the authorities foresee in closing the wage gap with Belgium's competitors. Public finances have also suffered some drift. The Dehaene government is vigorously trying to get the deficit under control, through a mix of new taxes and spending cuts. The near collapse of the government in March over a BFr110bn budget-cutting package underlined the political sensitivity of the task. The turnaround in government finances between 1981 and 1991 was impressive. Spending was cut from 59.6 per cent to 51.7 per cent of GDP, with revenues falling modestly from 46.4 per cent to 45.4 per cent. The deficit was thereby only cut from 13.3 per cent of GDP to 6.3 per cent. The balance of the budget after interest paid on debt is taken out, however, moved from a deficit of 5.5 per cent to a 'surplus' of 4.1 per cent. Nevertheless, the deficit with interest crept up to 6.9 per cent last year - well wide of the 3 per cent target set by the Maastricht treaty for 1996 for member states such as Belgium determined to be in the first wave of European economic and monetary union (Emu). Yet in the coming months the government can call in short-term debt, and refinance it long term, and in Belgian francs. 'I hope we will see in '94 the real reward for the strong franc policy,' says Mr Praet, who foresees a saving on the government's interest bill equivalent to 1 to 1.5 per cent of GDP. If interest rates in Germany, and therefore Belgium, ease down further, Belgium should be on target for a deficit of around 5.3-5.5 per cent of GDP next year. The authorities have little doubt that they can and must make it into the first wave of Emu. They point out that the franc became a refuge currency during last September's chaos in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System - with short-term inflows of BFr122bn, or 1.7 per cent of GDP. Speculators, they said, ignored the fact that Belgium's current account has had a surplus of around 2 per cent of GDP since 1985, and that in spite of the deficit in its public finances, it is a net creditor country through its high private savings. The brief rise in domestic interest rates during the March budget cuts and wage indexation crisis was quickly reversed. In the future, however, the franc could still come under pressure if wage indexation continues to erode Belgian competitiveness.</p>

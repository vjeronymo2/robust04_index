			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: Alcoa abandons joint venture with Alusuisse THE plans of Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) for substantial expansion in Europe were severely dented yesterday as it called off negotiations about a joint venture with Alusuisse-Lonza. The companies had hoped to set up a joint venture which would have invested SFr300m (Dollars 210m) to modernise and expand most of Alusuisse's aluminium operations in Switzerland. The aim was to expand their position in aluminium flat-rolled products for the European automotive, industrial and aerospace markets, which are forecast to have high growth rates during the next decade. If the deal had gone through Alcoa, the world's biggest aluminium group, would have immediately taken 60 per cent of Alusuisse's smelter, ingot casting operations and rolling facilities in the Canton of Valais. These produce high-technology products with high added-value such as 'superplastic' aluminium sheet for cars and a thick hard-alloy plate used in machinery manufacture. However, Alcoa said yesterday that 'in spite of intensive effort' the companies 'were not able to establish a satisfactory basis for co-operation.' Neither company would give any details about what caused the talks to break down. An Alusuisse official said there were differences of opinion during negotiations, which started in November last year.</p>

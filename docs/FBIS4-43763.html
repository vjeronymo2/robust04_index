			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [All figures as published] </F>   [Text] The economic stability package has begun to yield  its first results. The Ministry of Finance, which, for many  years, disclosed that the budget had a deficit, said yesterday  that for the first time the budget had a surplus in May. The  surplus totaled 6.3 trillion Turkish lira [TL].    The budget deficit, which totaled TL55.5 trillion from  January to April 1994, decreased to 49.1 trillion in May. The  deficit was estimated to total 10.8 trillion from April to June.  However, the budget had a surplus of 2.2 trillion from April to  May.    Turkey paid TL6 trillion on its foreign debts in May. That  figure, however, was transferred to the accounts in June.  Consequently, the budget indicated a surplus in May. Compared  with May 1993, the tax revenues, which make up the most  important part of the budget revenues, increased by 89.9 percent  to total TL162.6 trillion in May 1994.    The budget revenues covered 70.7 percent of the budget  spending in May 1993. They covered 81.5 percent of the budget  spending in May 1994.</p>

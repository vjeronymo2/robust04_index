			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: South Africa After enjoying a certain rehabilitation in world bond markets, South Africa is turning its attention to international equities too. The forthcoming Dollars 250m issue by Sappi, the paper concern, in theory offers an opportunity to capitalise on South Africa's low-cost base as well as the expected upturn in this sector. That said, Sappi needs another two or three years to digest its recent purchase of Germany's Hannover Papier. The political risk attached to South Africa remains considerable. If its prospects are really that good, such a low-geared company might be better off adding to its debt at this stage in the cycle.</p>

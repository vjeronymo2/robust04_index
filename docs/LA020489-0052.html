			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PSYCHIATRIC EXAM ORDERED FOR MOTHER WHO KILLED HER BABY  </P> <P> The judge who declared that Sheryl Lynn Massip was temporarily insane when she  killed her infant son Friday ordered the Anaheim woman to undergo a preliminary  review of her psychiatric condition to determine whether she should be confined  to a state mental institution.  </P> <P> At the same time, Orange County Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald  answered those who have attacked his extraordinary decision six weeks ago  finding Massip not guilty by reason of insanity in a brutal killing that her  lawyers blamed on an extreme form of the "baby blues."  </P> <P> Overturning a jury's murder verdict, Fitzgerald ruled Dec. 23 that the new  mother was suffering from postpartum psychosis and was not responsible for her  actions when she ran over her 6-week-old son with the family car in April,  1987.  </P> <P> Massip, 24, still could face up to 11 years in a state mental institution.  </P> <P> Fitzgerald's decision sparked a pending appeal from county prosecutors and  alarmed others in the legal community who feared that it signaled an  unwarranted expansion of judicial power. It also produced more than 60 letters  to the judge, some of which sharply attacked his position and called for his  ouster.  </P> <P> Addressing those who have challenged the existence of postpartum psychosis,  Fitzgerald said Friday: "It's my belief that you're simply not paying attention  to the current medical knowledge. And to the people that think I should step  down, I tell you a resounding 'no.' I won't do that."  </P> <P> Fitzgerald, a Superior Court judge since 1980, is up for reelection in 1992.  </P> <P> Later, the judge ordered county health professionals to complete a preliminary  review of Massip's mental condition by the end of the month.  </P> <P> Postpartum psychosis is thought to cause intense anxiety, delusions and  hallucinations and even violence in about one to three of every 1,000 new  mothers, researchers say.  </P></p>

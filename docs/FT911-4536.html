			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: Higher nickel prices fail to prevent Inco decline HIGHER nickel prices raised operating earnings from primary metals at Inco of Canada, the largest nickel company in the world, to USDollars 136m in the first quarter from USDollars 110m a year earlier. But overall net profit dipped 21 per cent to USDollars 53.6m or 50 cents a share from USDollars 67.7m or 64 cents a year earlier because of lower results from the alloys and engineered products business, currency adjustments and higher taxes. Revenues were USDollars 845m, against USDollars 735m. Realised nickel prices averaged USDollars 3.94 a lb in the first quarter, up from USDollars 3.69 a year earlier and USDollars 4.31 in the fourth quarter of 1990. Copper prices were stable. Finished nickel inventory at March 31 was 54m lbs, down from 56m lbs at December 31 1990. First-quarter nickel deliveries were 136m lbs against 123m lbs a year earlier. Copper, platinum,silver and gold deliveries were all up significantly, but cobalt declined. Inco said the market value of 62 per cent-owned Consolidated TVX Mining was almost USDollars 270m as of March 31, based on its gold mines in Quebec, Brazil and Chile.</p>

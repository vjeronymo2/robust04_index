			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GENDER FACTOR IN NOVEMBER GOVERNOR'S RACE  </P> <P> As a long-time Democrat, I want to express appreciation to Pete Wilson for  opening up the fall gubernatorial campaign on a positive note.  </P> <P> His new television ad shows how, as senator, he worked constructively with  then-Mayor Feinstein to solve problems in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Although it is reported that Wilson starts out with a substantial funding  advantage, it is gratifying that he would open the campaign by using some of it  to highlight Feinstein's skill in working with opposition legislators to  achieve goals, and her graciousness ("You're wonderful!") in dealing with  friend and foe alike.  </P> <P> As governor she will be able to work with state legislators of both parties  and, starting in 1991, Gov. Feinstein's good rapport with Sen. Wilson will  benefit all Californians.  </P> <P> MARK ADAMS  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

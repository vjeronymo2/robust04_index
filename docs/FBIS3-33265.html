During the ceremony to transfer the EPS installations  located at kilometer marker 20 of the road to Masaya to the  Environment and Natural Resources Ministry, EPS Chief Gen.  Humberto Ortega said yesterday that the Military High Command is  not planning to reestablish the SMP in the country. Here is what  Gen. Ortega said:    [Begin Ortega recording] It is not enough to disarm. An  effective program is necessary to permit the disarmed  individuals to earn a livelihood and gradually rejoin the  country's life through employment in order to increase their  standard of living and live decently. Disarmament is not enough  for peace to exist. We must all work to overcome the high levels  of inequality and poverty and to prevent the concentration of  capital in the hands of a few people because that will always  create a big gap between the few who have everything and the  many who have nothing. Those are the real roots of violence that  might come in the future. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / (CORRECTED) Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Claim for discount Correction (published 20th March 1993) appended to this article. MY WIFE owns a small cottage which is registered in her name. I believe she is entitled to a 50 per cent council tax discount on it as 'a second home.' But the local authority claims that 'a property which is not a sole or main residence but is furnished will not be subject to a discount,' according to a decision taken by the council. This appears to contravene the literature published by the Department of the Environment? While you would be entitled to a rebate on an empty property (for up to six months), the property is not regarded as empty while it remains furnished; hence, the council would appear to be correct. This is not a decision 'taken by the council' but an application of the rules which govern the new council tax. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible. CORRECTION The owner of a second home in England or Scotland will be entitled to a 50 per cent discount from the council tax. Special rules applying in Wales mean that the district council can decide whether to apply a discount of 50 per cent, or 25 per cent, or none at all. An answer published last week about this issue was incorrect.</p>

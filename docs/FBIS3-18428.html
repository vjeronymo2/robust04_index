The picture is  now complete, apart from three or four appeals to the regional  administrative courts, perhaps announced simply because of a  reluctance to admit being in the wrong. At 1400 hours [1300  GMT] yesterday the Appeal Court's central electoral office, in a  marathon five-day session, completed its examination of 204  appeals submitted by candidates excluded from the election,  primarily on basis of irregularities in the gathering of  signatures for the electoral lists. The 20 magistrates --  chosen by the first chairman of the Supreme Court in view of  their impartiality and the fact that they live in Rome --  returned to their regular jobs, leaving the clerk of the court's  office working intensively until the evening faxing the  magistrates' decisions to the various constituency offices that  forwarded appeals to Rome.    The final decisions entail Rete's exclusion from Campania 2  (Benevento, Avellino, Caserta, and Salerno) for the proportional  vote and the reinstatement for the proportional vote in Calabria  of the National Alliance lists (headed by Raffaele Valensise)  and the Communist Renewal lists (headed by Fausto Bertinotti).  But the Renewal [Rinnovamento], Pannella, and southern Italy  lists were not successful. With regard to some of the smaller  lists, the Veritas Movement and Fascism and Freedom were  approved , while the Southern Movement and European Liberal  Democrats were turned down. Last, the Popular Party's outgoing  deputy for the single-candidate constituency of Catanzaro was  reinstated.    The Southern Action League -- a political grouping headed by  Mayor of Taranto Giancarlo Cito -- will also be able to compete  for the proportional vote. The same decision was reached in  connection with Tommaso Mitrotti, former Italian Social Movement  [MSI] senator and founder of Social Democracy, which is linked  to Cito's movement, and Prince Sforza Ruspoli, linked with the  mayor with the South Wind-Viva Zapata list. The Appeal Court  turned down Novella Calligaris, a Chamber of Deputies candidate  for Rome's constituency 6 on the Pact for Italy list. The same  goes for Gianfranco Zambelli, on the same list in constituency  5, and Vincenzo Logasso of the Justicialist Party in  constituency 12. As for Milan, all the appeals by Chamber  candidates were turned down. Thus the exclusions affecting Uber  Ravagnani (Italian Citizens' Union), Antonio Ziveri (Pact), and  Eugenio Girolo (New Ecological Democratic Italy and Environment)  still stand.    Of the major parties, Forza Italia will be excluded from  Umbria for the Senate and in Puglia for the proportional vote;  the League in Rome and its province for the Senate and in the  Marches; the Pact in Piedmont for the proportional vote and one  of its candidates in Milan and two in Rome for the Chamber; the  Democratic Alliance in Trentino for the proportional vote; the  progressive alignment loses one Chamber candidate, again in  Trentino, and is excluded from the Senate elections in Nuoro  (Ayala's status as candidate for Catania is also in doubt);  Communist Renewal in Sicily; Rete in Campania and Veneto; the  Pannella list in two constituencies in Veneto for the  proportional vote and in the Marches, where it was standing  together with the Reformers; Renewal [Rinnovamento] in the  Marches, Umbria (the Senate), and Puglia (lower house).    Various kinds of appeal were announced the other day by the  League over the expulsion of its candidates in the Marches and  yesterday by Forza Italia in connection with its five lost  candidates in Umbria; by Sgarbi's former spokesman, Franco  Corbelli (Calabria); and by the Pannella list, which will appeal  "in every civil, political, and judicial forum" over its  exclusion from the two Veneto constituencies. Massimo Natale --  a Naples candidate not connected with any of the lists --  constitutes a separate case. The Appeal Court reinstated him,  but completing the list of symbols is proving a problem in  Naples because Massimo Natale does not have one. This means  that, at least in theory, an insoluble dispute could arise.  Parliament would have to have the final say on the matter.    Last, some observations about the principles pursued by the  Appeal Court's central electoral office. Appeals were allowed  in the case of such venial sins as small excesses in the number  of signatures, the use of non-regulation forms, the lack of  adequate documentation -- that is, all the cases in which the  errors did not undermine the relationship of trust between  voters and candidate. The other cases were rejected -- shortage  of signatures, their submission beyond the deadline, or obvious  frauds.</p>

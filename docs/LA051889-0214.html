			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> END ATHLETIC SCHOLARSHIPS, EDUCATOR ASKS  </P> <P> The head of the umbrella organization for the nation's colleges and  universities told Congress today that athletic scholarships should be ended and  the football, basketball and baseball seasons shortened to heal the "basically  unhealthy" system of campus sports.  </P> <P> Robert H. Atwell, president of the American Council on Education, also proposed  the elimination of freshman eligibility in football and basketball, and an  equal sharing of television revenues among all schools.  </P> <P> "First and foremost," said Atwell, "we must try to break the insidious  connection between money and winning" in big-time college sports.  </P> <P> Atwell was among several academic, media and sports federation officials who  testified before a House Education and Labor subcommittee on problems  afflicting collegiate sports programs.  </P> <P> Frank Deford, former senior editor for Sports Illustrated, declared that  "big-time college athletics has always been a scandal and always will be,  unless major changes are made. It is a professional game which poses as  amateur; a big business which uses free labor."  </P> <P> Deford rejected arguments that revenues generated by glamour sports benefits  higher education as a whole. "Rarely," he said, "does any money raised for  big-time athletics leave the athletic department to enhance the university  community."  </P> <P> Atwell, who said his proposals were his own and not those of the council's  member institutions, said "there is a major set of systemic problems that must  be addressed if we in higher education are serious about restoring public  confidence in intercollegiate athletics. . . . We must take care to diagnose  and treat the underlying pathology, lest we deal only with the symptoms."  </P> <P> "But I also believe that the fundamental responsibility for dealing with these  problems lies with the institutions, and there is only a limited amount the  federal government can do that would be appropriate."  </P> <P> Dick Schultz, executive director of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.,  said "I'm not here to tell you there are not problems," ranging from drug abuse  to academic and monetary cheating. "But the NCAA has not been sitting idly by,"  he added.  </P></p>

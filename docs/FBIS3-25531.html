The delegation which delivered a special message from  President Paul Biya to Abacha Thursday in Abuja, is believed to  have discussed current border difference between the two  countries with the Nigerian authorities, said the source.    Since the beginning of this year when Nigeria sent 500  troops  to its border with Cameroon, currently under dispute, the West  African nation, has maintained a low profile, bordering on  complete silence on the issue.    Press reports Friday here quoted the Nigerian defence  headquarters as warning journalists against focusing on the  issue as such information might likely jeopardise current peace  efforts to resolve the conflict.    A Lagos-based independent newspaper Thursday reported the  deployment of about 1,000 additional Nigerian troops to the  affected border area on Wednesday.</p>

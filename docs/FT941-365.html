			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Harland and Wolff cuts loss Losses at Harland and Wolff Holdings, the Belfast shipbuilding company, were cut from Pounds 10.7m to Pounds 5.65m pre-tax for the year to end-December. Mr Fred Olsen, the Norwegian shipowner who is Harland's main shareholder and company chairman, described the results as 'disappointing'. The company, which was completely reorganised into self-contained business divisions after privatisation in 1989, said the 1993 deficit included a charge of Pounds 4.1m for foreseeable losses on contracts which were in hand at the year end. Harland executives said they were scouring the world for new business.</p>

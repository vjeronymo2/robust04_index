			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party At Brighton: Tebbit electrifies anti-Maastricht forces THE DEEP divisions within the Conservative party over Maastricht were brutally exposed by Lord Tebbit yesterday as he seized on the debate on Europe to press the government to abandon ratification of the treaty. In an electrifying address the former party chairman won round after round of passionate applause from the treaty's opponents and provoked charges of 'Brutus' from Tory MEPs. But his rabble-rousing oratory and undisguised criticisms of Mr John Major were met with a calm and dextrous counter-attack from Mr Douglas Hurd, who warned that the party risked breaking itself over Europe. 'Let us decide to give that madness a miss,' he said to widespread applause. The foreign secretary's forthright defence of the government's achievements in the Maastricht negotiations - widely praised as a masterful performance - ensured that the highly vocal anti-treaty faction was defeated by an estimated margin of about 4 to 1 on an innocuous motion. The wording congratulated the government on its European Community presidency alongside an amendment seeking reforms to halt 'unnecessary interference from Brussels' and a more open, accountable community. Prior to the debate, many Conservatives had claimed that newspaper reports of a deep schism within the party on Maastricht were false. In the event, the ferocity of the head-on clash between opponents and supporters of Maastricht was far greater than any had predicted. Speaker after speaker sought, amid a cacophony of cheers and boos, to polarise the party between government loyalists and the distinctly more vociferous rebels. In their opening speeches, the movers sought to shut down the controversy by insisting that the enforcement of subsidiarity rules - devolving powers as closely as possible to those they could effect - would rectify the treaty's weaknesses. That hope was abruptly brushed aside when Dr Bernard Juby of Birmingham Yardley declared to a roar: 'The Maastricht treaty is dead - the Danes saw to that.' His theme was taken up and expanded when Lord Tebbit was welcomed to the platform with delegates on their feet in many parts of the hall. As a grim-faced platform looked on, the one-time Chingford MP offered curt congratulation to Mr Major's election victory, before going on to warn that the government was now 'in desperate trouble' with Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, under attack even in the normally loyal Conservative press. Then, in a clear sideswipe at the prime minister, who oversaw the UK's entry into the exchange rate mechanism, he added: 'I hope you will stand by your chancellor - it was not Norman Lamont's decision to enter the ERM. He did his best to make the unworkable work. 'The cost in lost jobs, bankrupt firms, repossessed homes, in the terrible wounds inflicted on industry, has been savage.' Lord Tebbit then set about Maastricht, claiming that 'a great tide of opinion' opposed to a federal community was engulfing Europe. With a direct challenge to Mr Major to 'raise the flags of patriots of all the states of Europe', he called on the prime minister to launch the drive for a treaty with 'no mention of more power for Brussels, no mention of economic, monetary and political union.' But Lord Tebbit was not without his critics. Immediately he sat down, Mrs Pamela Parker from East Surrey won applause from elsewhere in the hall when she declared her fury with his stance, warning that he was offering 'political suicide'. As opponents demanded a referendum, other loyalists underlined that the country would suffer dire consequences for industry if it abandoned Europe. Mr Malcolm Harbour from Solihull said thousands of jobs had been created by foreign investment and Britain was at the heart of Europe. Critics should 'go out into the streets of Sunderland and argue that they do not want the jobs created by us being at the heart of Europe,' he said. When Mr Hurd rose, his appeal was for cool heads. He stressed common ground in the party pointing out that very few opposed EC membership or advocated a European super-state. 'We are winning the arguments - now is not the time to kick over the table,' he said. Mr Hurd then went on to put the argument for Britain maintaining the stance it had taken prior to the election and in Commons' votes since. 'We don't want Britain to be on the sidelines when the security and prosperity of Europe are being decided. 'We know in our bones it's not safe, it's not wise, it's not right.' The foreign secretary promised that an explanatory booklet explaining the treaty would be made available and promised he would seek to establish ways of minimising interference by Brussels and means of increasing openness in decision-making. Summing up, Mr Hurd evoked what was once dubbed the white man's burden, concluding: 'In the name of that tradition . . I ask for your support as we extend and strengthen the effort which we, the British, make for a safer and more decent world.' His ovation was duly granted him.</p>

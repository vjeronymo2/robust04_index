			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Appetisers SOPHISTICATED Australians do exist. Two wines to seduce classicists intrigued, but still puzzled, by all the ballyhoo about antipodean vintages are subtle, smooth South Australian reds which will not jolt any lover of fine claret. Henschke's Abbott's Prayer 1990 (Pounds 11.64 from Lay &amp; Wheeler of Colchester) is a gorgeous blend of Merlot and Cabernet that is quite ready to drink but utterly convincing for the end of the century, too. Greg Trott, of the Wirra Wirra winery, produces another top-quality, ecclesiastically-named Cabernet blend in the prize-winning form of The Angelus 1991 (Pounds 7.99 from Oddbins). Decant and admire. * * * Whatever happened to rioja? We all loved it in the 1970s when it was cheap; but now that emergent Spaniards have pushed the price up, rioja has languished somewhat outside its native land. The Rioja Gran Reserva Club (managed by Adnams of Southwold on 0502-724 222) is an attempt to expose some of the finest mature rioja to British palates. There is no membership fee but orders must be for a minimum of a case (although two mixed cases are available). Most refined and 'modern' of the selection on offer until August 31 is Campillo 1982 at Pounds 172 a case - but do we want modernity of our rioja? Rather more traditional in both flavour and structure is the fragrant Carlos Serres 1985 at Pounds 141. Bargain hunters might consider the wide range of 'oaked' (although not necessarily barrel-aged) cheap Spanish reds. Victoria Wine's Casa Barco at Pounds 2.65 could do the trick for rioja nostalgics. * * * Bravely ignoring vintage port prices in the saleroom, the shippers have launched the 1991s - and jolly nice they are, too. Of big shippers, only Taylor has declined to 'declare,' a decision presumably not unrelated to the fact that 1992 was the company's tercentenary year. Other promising examples at a recent London tasting included a well-priced Smith Woodhouse, a distinctive Niepoort, an exciting Quinta do Noval, a suave Graham, a compact Dow and a lovely, dense Warre. Merchants making special offers include Adnams of Southwold (a six-bottle box of Dow or Warre is Pounds 80) and Berry Bros of London SW1.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] La Paz, 28 Apr (DPA) -- Despite a strong police and  military presence in Bolivian cities since early this morning,  demonstrations were held in several cities but were violently  dispersed. Meanwhile, surveys taken by several La Paz radio  stations regarding the social situation indicate that most urban  residents are asking for a state of siege "once and for all."    Lupe Cajis, the president of the La Paz Journalist  Association, told DPA that "the people are clamoring for a state  of siege." People called the radio stations to decry the acts of  vandalism by the demonstrators, who -- according to the radio  stations' listeners -- loot and destroy everything in their path  as they flee from the police tear gas.    The authorities used tear gas today to disperse several  attempts by the workers to gather at different points of La Paz.  "We are virtually living under a state of siege, the only thing  missing is an official declaration," a top opposition leader  said.    The state of emergency measure was expected tonight, but the  government of Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada decided at the last  moment not to implement it. Incidents of abuse by the men in  uniform against civilians not participating in the  demonstrations have been reported. Soldiers and policemen were  deployed in Bolivian cities in the early morning hours to  prevent workers rallies and demonstrations.    The Bolivian Labor Federation (COB) has been on an  indefinite  general strike since 15 April demanding a wage increase above  the 8 percent included in the general budget approved last week.  Several observers agree that the moderate COB leaders have been  overrun by extremists.</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: NatWest to securitise loans to companies NATIONAL Westminster is set to become the first UK bank to securitise loans made to companies, taking the assets off balance sheet and increasing its capacity to lend. The bank yesterday announced a Dollars 500m US commercial paper programme which will be backed by participations in syndicated loans and revolving credit facilities to European companies. The commercial paper will be issued through a special purpose company, Thames Funding, based in Delaware. The company will buy loan participations from NatWest, via another Cayman Islands subsidiary, and will fund the purchases by issuing asset-backed securities. Securitisation has been used by UK banks to take mortgage loans off balance sheet. Earlier this year the Bank of England issued guidelines for the securitisation of credit card loans. Mr Malcolm Veale, head of securitisation at NatWest, said the programme would provide floating-rate dollar funding at a level close to the London interbank offered rate. In addition, by taking the loans off balance sheet, NatWest liberates capital which can be used to make new loans. Mr Veale said that the bank currently has surplus capital but was making a long-term commitment to securitisation as a method of funding. NatWest has not identified which loans will be securitised. Mr Veale said companies had raised no objections during informal discussions. Paper issued by Thames Funding will carry top A1/P1 credit ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agencies, because all of the underlying loans are to companies which also carry a top rating. It is likely NatWest will securitise low-margin loans to big companies, signed in the late-1980s when lending margins were very tight.</p>

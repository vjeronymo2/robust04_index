			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CANNES FILE;  </P> <P> THE FESTIVAL BUZZ ON THE CROISETTE: 'JESUS,' OUI; 'ANGELS,' NON  </P> <P> Three of the four American films in competition for the Gold Palm were shown  during the first four days of this year's Cannes Film Festival, and as far as  the critics were concerned, it was rookie director Steve Soderbergh who brought  the best film.  </P> <P> Soderbergh's "sex, lies and videotape" was the clear favorite of an  international panel of critics polled in the trade paper Screen International.  </P> <P> The panel rated "sex, lies and videotape" well above both director James  Jarmusch's "Mystery Train," the Australian entry "A Cry in the Dark," and  French director Bertrand Blier's "Too Good for You."  </P> <P> But on Monday, audiences saw what may prove to be the most and least popular  films in the festival. Hugh Hudson's "Lost Angels," a Los Angeles-based story  about a middle-class juvenile gang member, was hooted at two press screenings  while Canadian director Denys Arcand's "Jesus of Montreal" drew the longest  ovation yet heard on the Croisette from the demonstrative media crowds. ("Lost  Angels" has already opened in many American cities, including Los Angeles, and  hasn't done much better with critics there.)  </P> <P> The Gold Palm winner, set to be announced May 23, will be determined by a  10-person jury headed by West German film maker Wim Wenders. The jury's lone  American member is actress Sally Field.  </P> <P> Some notes on a few of the early films at Cannes:  </P> <P> "Jesus of Montreal," Canada. Denys Arcand was discovered at Cannes three years  ago when his "The Decline of the American Empire" became the hit of the  Directors Fortnight.  </P> <P> "Decline," a French-language film about eight upscale Canadians concerned with  their sex lives, made some strong statements about the deterioration of values  in the West and Arcand's new film drives the point home with a stake.  </P> <P> "Jesus of Montreal" is a daring updating of the death and resurrection of  Christ, told through the story of a Montreal actor who puts on a revisionist  avant-garde play about Christ and has his own life parallel both the art and  the legend.  </P> <P> Segments of the film cast doubts on the biblical version of Christ and  comparisons will inevitably be made to Martin Scorsese's "The Last Temptation  of Christ." But Arcand, who says he hasn't even seen the Scorsese film, seems  less interested in challenging the faith than pointing out that man's  inhumanities are alive and ill in Montreal. The film includes unflattering  references to lawyers and agents, a bias Arcand admits was promoted by the  phony attention he got after "Decline." He said his sudden popularity changed  everyone around him, even his own lawyer.  </P> <P> "While negotiating for this film," Arcand said, "my lawyer said to me, 'What  about T-shirts? People are going to want to buy them.' I said, 'Listen, I'm  doing a film about Jesus Christ. Can you forget about T-shirts?' "  </P> <P> "Mystery Train," United States. James Jarmusch was also discovered at Cannes  through the unsanctioned Directors Fortnight. His "Stranger Than Paradise,"  which was later named best picture of 1984 by the National Society of Film  Critics in America, was an off-beat black-and-white comedy about two immigrant  cousins wandering through the United States.  </P> <P> Two years ago, he continued the theme with "Down by Law," which was in  competition for the Gold Palm, and this year he returns with what he calls --  retrospectively -- the third leg of a trilogy on immigrants' impressions of  America.  </P> <P> "Mystery Train" is three separate but simultaneously occurring stories linked  by a flea-bag hotel in urban Memphis, Tenn.  </P> <P> The first, and I can sense it's the best segment, is about a Japanese couple  making a pilgrimage to the birthplace of rock 'n' roll. The boy reveres Carl  Perkins and Roy Orbison; she is strictly an Elvis fan. The second story is  about an Italian woman stranded briefly in Memphis after her husband dies on an  airplane. The third is about an English Elvis Presley look-alike who, in a  drunken rage, shoots a liquor store clerk and goes on the lam with his shocked  American buddies.  </P> <P> "Mystery Train" delivered bigger laughs than either of Jarmusch's earlier  films, but it roused little enthusiasm among the American critics here.  </P> <P> The $2.7-million film was financed by JVC, the giant Japanese electronics firm,  and will be released in the United States this summer.  </P> <P> "sex, lies and videotape," United States. This first film by 26-year-old  American Steven Soderbergh has been the talk of the festival so far.  </P> <P> The crisply written film focuses on a Baton Rouge, La., couple whose troubled  marriage is finally undone when the husband's old college friend returns to  town with a peculiar hobby of interviewing women about their sex lives on  videotape.  </P> <P> The film is in equal parts about deceit, sexual repression and aggression, and  the inundation of video.  </P> <P> Critics are raving about all the actors in the film, but James Spader, getting  a break from all those preppy roles, may be in line for a best actor award for  his moving performance as the video voyeur trying to make peace with himself.  </P> <P> "sex, lies and videotape," made on a budget of $1.2 million, will be released  this summer in the United States by Miramax Films.  </P> <P> Bertrand Blier's "Too Good for You," which stars Gerard Depardieu as a Paris  businessman whose affections are divided between his homely mistress and his  beautiful wife, was better appreciated by French critics than the Americans,  but is nonetheless one of the early festival hits.  </P></p>

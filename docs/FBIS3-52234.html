			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by King Husayn at a meeting of "high-ranking </F> Jordanian Army officers" in Amman on 1 January--recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] We never gave up faith that we  are part of one big Arab family. Jordan continued on the course  of the great Arab revolt in defending Palestine, the right of  its people to their land, and the right of the Arabs and Muslims  in Palestine and in all the big homeland.    In 1948, when they decided to enter Palestine militarily, in  spite of all the perils and risks, this country had the honor to  move and offer something. This Army, in particular, had had the  honor of saving the major part of Palestine, and Jerusalem. We  will remember the martyrs as long as we live, and generations to  come will also remember them, not to mention the jihad, the  sincerity, the courage, and the wisdom of the leadership which  enabled much to be attained. Had it not been for this fact of  saving the West Bank, there would not have been an opportunity  now to discuss how to regain a specific part of the land either  by us or by anyone else. No one should forget this fact. We do  not say this to have others express gratitude that we have done  this and performed this. This is a duty, an honor, and a  commitment. We say this just to state a fact which we should  not forget because many of us in this part of the world had  forgotten many facts from which one could have benefited because  they constitute features of what deserves to be adopted or from  which advice and lessons could be learned. [passage omitted]    The talk now is about the Jordanian-Palestinian  relationship.  This relationship is solid, deep, and unique. I frankly say  that perhaps we wronged ourselves for many years by agreeing to  be an object of attacks, insults, accusations, and the forging  of facts. We tolerated these things and we did not deal with  them as we should have done. This method, in itself, led to  atmospheres fraught with skepticism and doubts, as if in 1948,  1949 and in all the years that followed and from the beginning,  Jordan and its leadership have had an objective other than the  noble objective of honorably defending this nation and  protecting its right, and that Jordan sought to obtain  something, or aspired to impose its control. Within this  framework, all the Arab, Palestinian, and hostile forces  intentionally or unintentionally contributed to sowing doubts  and to negatively affecting the picture. However, had we not  taken the stand we took in 1967 -- and we were aware of what the  result would be -- there would have been an opportunity for an  explosion in this country from within, and Israel would have  occupied this country, not only the West Bank, but our entire  territory as well [passage omitted]    Going back to 1967 and the long years and suffering. A  sisterly Arab country was ahead of us in signing a peace treaty  with Israel. The situation then developed into an agreement  between the Palestinian leadership, which represents the  Palestinian Arab people, and the Israeli side. This leadership  is the party that has the power, and our role is a supportive  one in this case regardless of all other considerations.    The agenda which deals with our issues was signed, and  efforts began to discuss its various clauses, which are  headlines for all issues important to us. This does not  adversely affect the Palestinian rights on their national soil  as far as we are concerned.    This is the situation. In addition to this, there is  coordination with our brothers within the framework of our  utmost capabilities. I believe that the brothers in Syria are  also on their way to discussing the dimensions dealing with  Syria, and the same is the case with Lebanon. We are in contact  with them. We make our own decisions, and we fulfill our  obligations toward ourselves, but frankly we believe that there  are thorny issues that need time before they are resolved,  because this country has endured more than any other country  since the beginning, and on all levels. All attempts and all  pressures we suffered during the past period... [pauses] All  quarters have been asking us to conclude a peace treaty. The  answer to all of this was that the peace treaty comes at the  end, when all presented issues are resolved in a satisfactory  manner to us, of course, and to the concerned parties.    Peace is not a document that we sign, then we start to  negotiate. No, we should discuss everything, and when we reach  an acceptable and reasonable result, and when we think that our  brothers at that time will be in a similar position or ahead of  us, then the comprehensive peace will be realized. This peace  is what we have been calling for since the very beginning. This  is our march and this what we are trying to do.    Our preparations are complete, praise be to God, and we  concentrate on three main issues. The issue of land; we have an  occupied land that was occupied in the south shortly after 1967.  The area of this occupied land is not small, and we insist that  it should fully return to Jordanian sovereignty.    There is also the subject of water. You hear much about  peace as something that we can consider or leave. We should be  aware of the fact and the reality. All reports and studies  indicate that in the year 2010 there will not be enough drinking  water for the people in Jordan. Practically, we consume less  water than others do. This water is consumed by the people, not  by agriculture, industry, or any other sector. This is a  serious problem that is also facing others. If we consider only  this dimension, it will be a great duty to discuss the future of  the next generations and how they are going to live.    At least, we have to do whatever we can to ease our  consciences in the hope that we will achieve a just,  comprehensive, and full peace that would restore rights to their  rightful owners and give us the chance to have a rest even for  once in preparation for a new phase, given that a state of just,  comprehensive, and full peace would provide people with life  opportunities that are completely different from those we have  seen in terms of educational opportunities, peace of mind,  future stability, security and work.    We face constant siege and pressure. We will not accept  anything that we do not believe to be right and just. Our heads  will never bow to anyone other than Almighty God. But on the  other hand, we want just and comprehensive peace. We want a  life for your sons and for those who will come afterward.    Israel is a small spot in a large ocean. If the desired  peace is established the way it should, with the passage of  time, the problem as it is at present will be resolved and done  away with. If there are other means that could help ensure  stability and guarantee the survival of future generations, I am  personally unaware of such means.    With regard to Jordanian-Palestinian relations, I have, as a  matter of course, noted, among other things, three issues.  These are territory, water resources, and the human individual  in terms of the modalities of moving from our current status to  the status that should prevail, the opportunities that must be  made available to him, the kind of life he must enjoy,  stability, the opportunities that would enable him to fulfill  himself and achieve all that is possible at present and in the  future so he may make up for lost opportunities, and so he may  become strong and capable of coping with life and its future  challenges. Last, but not least, there is the issue of  Jerusalem. Jerusalem will remain in our hearts, consciences,  minds, and chests. It will continue to shape our entire lives.  This has been the case in the past since the inception of the  Great Arab Revolt and continued until the establishment of this  kingdom on this spot of earth and thereafter--throughout all  stages, be they sweet or bitter, that is, in 1948, 1967, and to  date. This will remain the case until doomsday. For in no way  whatsoever shall we abandon our responsibilities toward  Jerusalem. There are many sides which have their own formulas  and views regarding the issue of Jerusalem. But, given the fact  that the overall agreement reached between the Palestinians and  Israelis was grounded in Security Council Resolution 242, then  this agreement covers Jerusalem. If the [Palestinian] brothers  were to succeed in their endeavors in the near future, Jerusalem  might, God willing, become the symbol of Palestinian-Israeli  reconciliation and peace.    As regards holy shrines in Jerusalem and our  responsibilities  toward them, we will do our best to safeguard and protect these  holy shrines. It is our firm belief...[pauses] We have lately  called for the restoration of Islamic sovereignty over Islamic  holy shrines in Jerusalem. This could be achieved through the  creation of a nonpolitical body that might bring together the  Islamic world and the splintered Islamic nation. It is hoped  that such a proposal would enable this nation to play its role  and perform its duty toward Jerusalem. If this were to be  achieved, we would immensely assist such an endeavor to perform  our duty in this regard.    As a matter of course, we call for the continuation of  inter-faith dialogue. We also believe that no single country  should exercise sovereignty over the holy shrines of the  children of Abraham, may God's peace be upon him. For no  sovereignty except that of God should be exercised over these  holy shrines. God might have willed that this city, which  houses shrines that move the hearts of faithful people, lead a  kind of life that is unprecedented throughout its long history.  This would materialize someday if all faithful people were to  choose to humble themselves before the Almighty God, to worship  Him, and to respect one another within the context of just and  honorable peace. We do not recognize the sovereignty of any  party over Jerusalem and Islamic holy shrines there except that  of the Almighty God.    This is what we are attempting to promote on the universal,  religious, Arab, and Islamic levels. We beseech God to make  Jerusalem a meeting point for all Arabs and Muslims, just as  Palestine should have been. We have been making enormous  efforts to safeguard the future, and will continue to do so.  This is the overall picture. I hope that I have managed to  explain it to you, or to address some of its main features as  they have unfolded during the recent past.    On the Jordanian-Palestinian level, we held a meeting 48  hours ago. I personally regard that meeting as a decisive one.  Both the climate and the responsibility require complete  frankness. In that meeting, we were extremely frank, gave  advice, and defined the fact that we are committed to what we  agree on, and that we cannot tell our people that there is  coordination unless there is an actual coordination. We cannot  tell our people that there is agreement unless there is an  actual agreement. We were promised that on Tuesday [4 January],  to be exact, the brothers will come here in order to address the  required priorities with all possible speed and with the needed  perfection and clarity.    For our part, we said that this would be the last  opportunity. Otherwise, and henceforth, each side would  separately assume its responsibilities. We made attempts and  tolerated too much and we cannot proceed in this way. We would  then frankly brief the people on all details. We will extend  backing and support within the confines of our capabilities and  resources, provided that the path has clear features.  Commitment should mean commitment. We should not remain in a  whirlpool of talks that do not yield tangible results. I ask  God that the brothers would be at the required level. It goes  without saying that recently I offered advice and tried to say  that the situation has changed, that this leadership now must be  a leadership for all the Palestinians in the inside and outside.  The Palestinians must feel that they are part of the march at  this criticial stage. Those who are capable of assuming  responsibility should be prepared to do so. They must be given  the chance to work in all fields. The question of credibility  is very important. We agreed and disagreed tens of times.  Then, we found that there are interpretations of what had been  agreed. We disagree on these interpretations. However, the  picture now is different. The situation is critical and calls  for another method. We ask God to help our brothers adopt this  method. We will extend support within the confines of our  capabilities and resources.    The issue of the bridges, about which you have heard  perhaps,  was also a point concerning which we blamed the brothers, too;  the reports that we heard, namely, that they say that Jordan  wishes Israeli control to remain on the crossings and bridges?  We are not a party. We told the brothers that we are a state  and they are now on the way to establishing their own state. We  are on the bridges. We, who are sharing the pain and suffering  of our people in the occupied territories, find it impossible to  prefer--if this is possible--any presence on these bridges on  the Palestinian side except the Palestinians. This climate and  this venom is there.    In my talks [with 'Arafat] about the confederation, I asked  the brother president to drop this expression from his lexicon  and absolutely not to discuss it with me, not in any form--not  even any other formula, other type, or other approach that leads  to this course.    Brothers, let us be frank. Our enemies worked against us.  Ignorant elements and many sides worked against us, harmed this  real and unique relationship between relatives and brothers who  lived together, and suffered together. Speaking about formulas  for the future, we are now tackling differences which exist  among our brothers and relatives in the Arab homeland within the  framework of the latest formuals that they had agreed. We want  to start from the base and reach the top. We need time to  dispel these doubts and illusions. The Palestinians and  Jordanians must know that they are brothers. If the problems  stem from the highest echelons, let us start from a sound basis  and let us fully offer our support and backing within the  confines of our capabilities. Let us work and at the  appropriate time and circumstances, people will decide the  nature of the relationship which should be established. But, to  create formulas and act on them, I believe is premature and out  of place. [passage omitted]</p>

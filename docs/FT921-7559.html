			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Shift seen in women's retirement age WOMEN IN occupational pension schemes which provide for them to retire at 65 for the first time outnumber those in schemes which provide for retirement at 60, according to a survey of pension fund managers. The survey also showed a sharp rise in schemes with equal retirement ages for men and women. The 1991 annual survey of the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF), released yesterday, showed that 42 per cent of schemes - with 51 per cent of women in pension schemes - have a normal retirement age for women of 65. A further 49 per cent of schemes - with 42 per cent of the women - have 60 as the retirement age for women. Men and women have equal retirement ages in 75 per cent of schemes, compared with 53 per cent last year. In 57 per cent of those schemes the common retirement age is 65 and in 32 per cent it is 60. This reflects changes in the private sector while the government is considering the equalisation of pension ages for state pensions. The Department of Social Security issued a consultation document on the subject late last year. Mr Brian MacMahon, NAPF chairman, said: 'Industry is sending a clear message on the need to resolve the equalisation of state pension ages. The NAPF continues to support the principle of flexible retirement with 65 as the pivotal age.' The survey was conducted among 778 members of the occupational pensions industry and covered 900 pension funds. It showed that 90 per cent of those in pension funds now receive guaranteed annual increases and a further 9 per cent have payments reviewed annually. For 94 per cent of those in the public sector, payments increase in line with the retail prices index. In the private sector 45 per cent of schemes offer limited price indexation, which is the RPI up to 5 per cent. Annual survey of occupational pension schemes.

TRADE UNION pressure for greater control on the administration of pension funds in the wake of the Maxwell affair intensified this week as unions submitted evidence to the Commons select committee on social security, Diane Summers writes. The National Communications Union, which represents 150,000 members, the majority of whom are in two BT pension schemes, told the committee it wanted a range of measures in recognition that 'pensions are the deferred pay of employees'. The NCU submission includes proposals for regulations to guide actuaries in the assumptions they use to value surpluses. The union says there should be rules on the provision of information to pension scheme members about management and investment strategies. The Trades Union Congress has already called for pension legislation to ensure half of a trust board is taken from the scheme's membership. The TUC wants unions and trustees to receive information at the same time as employers. Other unions to submit evidence to the select committee have mostly been directly involved in the Maxwell businesses. They include the GPMU print union, the National Union of Journalists and Balpa, the airline pilots' union. Maxwell pension cash, Page 21</p>

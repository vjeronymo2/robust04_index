			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 16 May (PL) -- Representatives of  cooperatives and the country's most productive peasants began a  meeting here today to exchange experiences and to commemorate  the 35th anniversary of the agrarian reform law.    Orlando Lugo Fonte, president of the National Association of  Small Farmers of Cuba, said in a speech at the Orlando Pantoja  Agriculture-Livestock Cadres School in the outskirts of the  capital that the main topics to be discussed are quality and  increased production in agriculture.    Fonte noted that those attending the meeting will take note  of a report, experiences in which limitations in fertilizers,  pesticides, and other raw materials to obtain good harvests have  been overcome, reported on by the national Radio Reloj station.    Those present make up the most productive sectors of Cuba in  key areas that obtain convertible foreign exchange, such as  sugarcane, citrus fruits, and coffee.    The meeting was chaired by Jose Ramon Machado Ventura,  member  of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba; Alfredo Jordan,  minister of agriculture; and Nelson Torres, sugar industry  minister.    The agrarian reform was promulgated on 17 May 1959 by the  foremost leader of the Cuban revolution, Fidel Castro, during a  ceremony held in the Sierra Maestra, the principal range of  mountains from where he lead the war of national liberation.    The law modified the farm production structure, determining  that areas encompassing over 400 hectares would become state  patrimony and turning over land to thousands of bereft peasants.</p>

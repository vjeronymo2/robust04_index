			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Corn on the cob GOOD OLD Country Life. Some people are rude about it, you know. They say it is antediluvian, mimsy mamsy, camp and affected - cynical in its defence of a way of life and a set of values that should have died out in the Middle Ages. At the Notting Hill dinner parties I usually go to - we eat everything with our fingers and have zillions of tons of cred - there is nothing like Country Life for generating laughter. You only have to mention it and the hands on the clapometer whirl giddily round and round. 'Did you know', someone will say, quoting a recent article, 'that a set of Windsor chairs at Beaulieu, emblazoned with the arms of the second Duke of Montagu, may be the earliest Gothic-Revival chairs in existence?' Or: 'According to Country Life, the science of breeding English foxhounds was revolutionised in the first half of this century - the aim being to lighten their conformation and improve hunting ability by use of the Welsh outcrop.' Or: 'The arrival of warm, sun-burnished corn cobs in the kitchen is a reminder that the year is growing old. Snatched piping hot from the pan, corn-on-the-cob needs no other accompaniments than a supply of melted butter, a dish of fine sea salt, a fully charged pepper mill and a large, absorbent napkin.' Or: 'It's a terribly good summer for voles . . . ' I never join the laughter. For my money, Country Life does a stalwart job in defending traditional values. It is a bulwark against the knockers, positive vs negative, a winking blip of sanity in a crazy, warring world wracked by pre-millennial tension. I especially enjoyed its editorial comment in the August 5 issue, applauding the news that porters have been reinstated at London's King's Cross rail station just in time for the grouse season, 'when sportsmen and women will begin the traditional struggle towards sleeper compartments, slung about with guncases, fishing rods and well-seasoned luggage. Now they need only part with a couple of pounds to find their impedimenta - up to five pieces - carried for them.' Well spoken, Country Life. But it did not rest on its laurels. Instead, it broadened its argument by calling for changes to the employment laws so that it would be easier to find servants to work in the countryside. It wants the cost of employing domestic staff to be allowable against tax. 'The notion that only the small number of (house) owners lucky enough to employ butlers would gain from it is absurd', said the magazine. 'The majority of domestic staff in the countryside consist of daily cleaners, gardeners and grooms who work in and round houses that are by no means ducal.' I agree with this entirely. I have a PA and a cleaner; otherwise I am bereft. I choose my own clothes in the morning and drive myself to work where I have to operate the lift (elevator, to Americans) to reach my third-floor office. I do my own telephoning and all my own typing and actually write this column. Yes, I write this column personally. No one lends a hand. You would think I would write the intro and then someone would take over. At lunch in the corporate restaurant I choose all my own food and stagger around with a tray. Then I do more telephoning and perhaps a bit more typing and probably attend a meeting - I have to attend in person - and then I drive home again through nasty beasty traffic where I cook my own dinner and choose a bedtime book which I have to read out loud to myself because there is no one to read it for me. All of which is outrageous. I am not the sort of person who was put on this planet to choose his own clothes, drive himself to work, operate lifts (elevators, to Americans), do his own telephoning, actually write a column, serve himself in restaurants, personally attend meetings, cook his own dinner, read his own book or wrestle with any of the humiliating tasks and challenges which beset modern life. I am the sort of person who should live in a moated manor house with servants to dress him, drive him, feed him, read to him and tell him whether this is a good summer for voles or an absolutely brilliant one. Dear old Country Life. Its campaign for tax deductible servants is steeped in rightness. The next time people laugh at it at a Notting Hill dinner party I shall bang my corn cob on the table and make my opinion known.</p>

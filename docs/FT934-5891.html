			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Merrett syndicate support Members agents at Lloyd's of London were increasingly confident yesterday that Syndicate 418, the biggest of six syndicates managed by Merrett Underwriting Agency Management, the Lloyd's agency, will continue underwriting next year. It is understood that negotiations to transfer administration of the syndicate, one of the most important at the Lloyd's insurance market, to another leading managing agency were well advanced last night. It had been feared that a sharp fall in backing from members' agents - who channel Names onto Lloyd's syndicates - would force 418 to close next year, leaving several thousand Names with a potentially expensive bill to run-off (meet claims on policies affecting) the syndicate's 1991, 1992 and 1993 years of account. Members agents, who cold shouldered the Merrett syndicates earlier this year, are thought to have offered more capacity on condition that the syndicate's management is transferred to a new agency. The breakthrough follows the intervention of Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of Lloyd's, and the creation of a steering group to co-ordinate rescue efforts. Agents are less confident, however, about the prospects for syndicate 1067, which is still likely to go into run-off. 1067's underwriter, Mr Stewart Laderman joined Zurich Re, the Swiss reinsurance company, last week. It had already been expected that the management of four smaller Merrett syndicates - numbers 179, 332, 1038 and 1184 - would be transferred to other Lloyd's agencies. Two weeks ago, Travelers Insurance of the US, withdrew a plan which would have provided extra backing to compensate for the fall off in agency support, plunging the group into crisis.</p>

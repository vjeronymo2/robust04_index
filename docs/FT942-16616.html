			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Belgium poised to send troops to Rwanda Belgium placed parachute battalions on alert yesterday as several western countries prepared to evacuate their citizens from Rwanda, where two days of heavy fighting have claimed the lives of UN peacekeepers, aid workers and hundreds of civilians. The moves came as rival factions in the capital, Kigali, were reported by the UN Security Council last night to have agreed a ceasefire and on the appointment of an interim government. A statement from the council said an acting president and prime minister and five ministers had been named. The situation outside Kigali was relatively calm, the council said, while within the city itself 'the security situation has continued to improve, although. . . it is still far from good'. Earlier in the day, after emergency cabinet meetings, the Belgian government promised unspecified measures to guarantee the safety of its 1,500 citizens in the former east African colony. The defence ministry in Brussels said that about 800 troops were ready to help evacuate foreign nationals. The US - which is also making plans to remove its 255 nationals from the strife-torn capital, where fighting flared near the American embassy - said talks on evacuation were under way with other governments who had citizens in Rwanda. French military officials said Paris was considering using troops stationed in the Central African Republic to rescue its 600 nationals, while Canada is to remove 200 citizens. Ten Belgian soldiers were killed in Rwanda on Thursday. They were among 400 serving with a 2,500-strong UN force which is policing a peace accord agreed last August. Kigali collapsed into anarchy following the death on Wednesday night of President Juvenal Habyarimana in an air crash. Rwandan diplomats claim the president's aircraft was shot down by the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front, but the group has denied involvement. UN military observers have not been allowed to inspect the wreckage of the aircraft at Kigali airport. Burundi's leader, Mr Cyprien Ntaryamira, was also killed in the crash. News of the alleged assassination unleashed long-standing rivalries between the late president's Hutu tribe and the minority Tutsi group. Nuns, priests, aid workers and government ministers, along with the UN peacekeepers, have been killed. Red Cross workers in Kigali reported 'hundreds and hundreds of dead and thousands of injured', a spokesman said. The Tutsi-led RPF was reported to have been fighting the presidential guard in Kigali earlier yesterday. Several thousand RPF troops were said to be marching to the capital from their strongholds in the north. Medecins Sans Frontieres, the medical charity, said Hutus were arming themselves in the refugee camps along the Burundi border. Some 4,000 refugees have poured into neighbouring Tanzania, the first of what eventually could be up to 150,000 refugees, the New York-based International Rescue Committee said yesterday.</p>

The new work shows that  the gene plays a key role in suppressing cancerous growth in the colon, and  possibly elsewhere in the body, said researchers from Johns Hopkins University  in Baltimore and Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. Healthy persons  usually have two normal gene copies.  </P></p>

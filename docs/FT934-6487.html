			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Divided picture from European chemicals  -Shares have risen against a background of poor earnings At first sight, the performance of European chemicals stocks this year has been impressive. Since the beginning of January, BASF's shares have risen 30 per cent, Bayer's 22 per cent and Hoechst's 12 per cent. In the Netherlands, DSM is up 35 per cent. Akzo was up 42 per cent until it announced its merger with Nobel, of Sweden, this month. Even Solvay, of Belgium, is 24 per cent ahead. But although all chemicals stocks have increased in value this year, most have underperformed their respective local markets. Ms Jackie Ashurst, chemicals analyst at James Capel, reckons it has been the third worst performing sector in Europe this year. Hoechst has underperformed the market by 17 per cent this year, for example. Nevertheless, the chemical sector's underperformance has not been as great as it might have been, given its present predicament. The continuing rise of chemicals stocks sits oddly with the piteous state of the European chemicals market. While share prices have risen, quarterly results have been progressively more disappointing. The outlook for next year remains grim. This week, Mr Jurgen Strube, BASF chairman, said his group was likely to cut its dividend again this year and he expected business to remain weak before turning up in 1995. The reasons for the dire financial performance of Continental chemicals groups are not hard to find. Commodity chemicals are having a rough time. Weakening demand growth and overcapacity have hit prices and undermined margins. Few petrochemicals makers, for example, are making money at the moment. At the same time, those companies with large pharmaceuticals divisions - normally a good hedge against wickedly cyclical commodity chemicals - have been hit by health care reform in most of Europe's largest countries. The German market, Europe's largest, has registered a 10 per cent drop over the first nine months of this year, while the Italian sector has suffered a 3 per cent fall. Such was their decline that the European drugs market recorded no growth during the nine months to September, probably the first time the sector has ever gone ex-growth. Groups such as Hoechst and BASF have warned that their dividends may have to be cut. The apparently resilient stock market performance of the chemicals groups has been driven partly by fund managers choosing to invest in countries rather than sectors. Given that the large chemicals groups are so liquid, investors in Germany are likely to build their positions in BASF, Bayer and Hoechst, while those wanting to put money into the Dutch or Belgian markets are likely to pick DSM, Akzo or Solvay. Fundamentals are also driving the sector. The US recovery, a strong US dollar and falling interest rates have added to its attractions. The stocks' yields also remain high compared with long-term bonds. The possibility of improved earnings in the medium term is also holding up share prices. At every industry conference and every results meeting, chemicals groups have been warning about the need for restructuring. This is not new. But there seems to be a greater sense of urgency than for many years. This week, Enichem, the Italian state-owned group, announced 10,000 job losses over the next four years. Earlier this month, BASF announced 3,000 job cuts by the end of 1995. Plant closures are also in the pipeline, aimed at reducing costs as well as capacity. Any improvement in companies' cost-base should fall through to the bottom line, and any cut in capacity should help prices. Even though corporate results are likely to make grim reading over the next 12 months, the downside to the chemicals market is likely to be limited, says Ms Ashurst. The dangers of missing out on a pre-recovery rally of chemicals stocks are simply too great.</p>

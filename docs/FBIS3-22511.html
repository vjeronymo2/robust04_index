In December, 2,513 fell ill from chicken pox, which is  spreading, and 1,654 had strep throat. Epidemiologist Dr.  Borislav Aleraj reported that, contrary to expectations for this  time of the year, hepatitis infections declined from 119 in  December 1992 to 81 in November and 62 in December 1993.    According to Aleraj, it was expected that in December the  number of trichinosis infections will decline; 19 persons fell  ill after having eaten undercooked domestically bred pork. There  were 321 persons infected by salmonella, a normal seasonal  decline compared to 427 cases in November and a slight increase  in comparison with December 1992.    In December, two more persons, both from a high-risk group,  were infected with AIDS. There were no reports of typhoid fever;  throughout 1993, there were only three separate cases reported.  They were taken care of and did not cause new infections, Dr.  Aleraj added.    Occurrences of diseases that can be eliminated through  systematic vaccination are rare or nonexistent. In December only  one case of measles and one case of malaria were reported; there  were a few other cases during the year, originating in one of  the tropical countries.</p>

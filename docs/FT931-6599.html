			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Producing abroad trims drug exports THE DRUGS industry is trumpeted as one of Britain's few remaining manufacturing success stories. The UK's position as a world leader in manufacturing medicines should be secure. It has two of the world's top six pharmaceuticals groups, the world's best-selling drug (Zantac) and a record trade surplus last year of Pounds 1.3bn. But the outlook is worrying. Although exports have grown from Pounds 139m in 1970 to Pounds 2.99bn in 1992, the rate of import penetration has grown faster. Whereas exports exceeded imports by a factor of four in 1970, the ratio was 1.5 by last year. One reason for this is that British doctors are prescribing increasing numbers of foreign drugs. According to Lehman Brothers in London, the second largest prescription drugs company in the UK by sales last year was Astra of Sweden, rather than UK groups such as SmithKline Beecham, Wellcome or Fisons. UK-based companies continue to discover and market world-class drugs, however. Six of the world's 20 top selling drugs in 1991 were developed by British companies. But many British groups are manufacturing a larger proportion of their drugs abroad. Dr Joe Blaker, group technical director in charge of manufacturing at Glaxo, the biggest drugs group in the UK and Europe, explains: 'It would be inappropriate for a global drugs concern like us to put all our manufacturing facilities in one country, even if we are a British-based company.' Dr Blaker says that the turning point came in the early 1980s when Glaxo began to internationalise its research and development activities. The aim was to tap scientific expertise outside the UK. By locating drug development in markets such as the US, products were also likely to be licensed by regulatory authorities more quickly. Overseas manufacturing soon followed the research and development push. Manufacturing problems can be ironed out faster by locating production near research and development centres, allowing drugs groups to launch products earlier. Dr Blaker says: 'Ten years ago the US market was almost entirely supplied by product from the UK - the American manufacturing side was very embryonic.' Glaxo's sales to the US in the last six months of 1992 were Pounds 954m. Last year Glaxo's UK manufacturing investment was Pounds 72m, compared with Pounds 124m outside the UK. Over the last four years manufacturing investment overseas has been greater than that in the UK. The company is currently building a Pounds 100m complex in Singapore to manufacture primary materials for medicines. It already manufactures 53 per cent of its product volume outside the UK. Glaxo's example is not unique. Wellcome manufactures an increasing amount overseas. While 65 per cent of the active ingredients for its medicines are manufactured in the UK, only 40 per cent of its finished products are made in Britain. The company says local production plants are more easily able to deal with local requirements, such as dosing, packaging and leaflets. The future of the UK's leading drugs groups is not in doubt. The best - Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham and Wellcome - continue to attain double-digit earnings growth. But the benefits of their success for Britain's export balance are likely to diminish.</p>

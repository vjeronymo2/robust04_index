			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Reduction gives Pounds 100m boost to small companies With nearly 60 per cent of all small UK companies using bank overdrafts  - compared with only 14 per cent in Germany and 31 per cent in France - the reduction in interest rates will bring modest but immediate help to businesses slowly emerging from recession. Each one-percentage-point change in borrowing charges is calculated to represent a Pounds 200m saving - or additional burden - to business costs, so the prospect of Pounds 100m less going to banks and finance houses was widely and warmly welcomed yesterday by the small-business sector. The Federation of Small Businesses said: 'Businesses should be getting letters immediately explaining that their loan and overdraft charges have been cut again. If it is coupled next week with a Budget for business, optimism about prospects for 1994 will be much improved.' It added: 'If this means that taxes are set to rise next week, then all the good will be totally undone. We also need to be as sure as possible that, given the economic climate, low rates are here to stay.' Britain's small-business organisations were quick to point out that the cost of money - now at its lowest for them since 1972 - no longer ranked particularly high on their list of problems. One of the principal problems in recent months, as companies attempt to grow their way out of the recession, has been to secure appropriate lines of finance. The federation said: 'The cost of money could be even lower but it doesn't really matter if you can't find someone prepared to lend to you.' The issue of small-business finance has moved close to the top of the business community's agenda and the Treasury and the Bank of England are examining the availability of equity finance and credit. The Forum of Private Business reported yesterday that 41 per cent of smaller businesses were now recording growth in turnover, the highest level achieved for about three years. But it emphasised that only 10 per cent of small companies rated finance and interest rates as their prime concern. 'There are many other issues which the government needs to act upon if the growing business sector is to thrive again,' it said. The forum said that in particular it wanted action on measures to speed up the late payment of bills, improvements in insolvency laws and the promised reduction in regulations and red tape.</p>

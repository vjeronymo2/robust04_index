			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (ii) Payments made or to be made with respect to contracts described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section by nongovernmental persons (or by other persons under those contracts) exceed 10 percent of the debt service with respect to that issue over the contract term, determined under the rules provided in &sect;1.141&hyph;4 (that is, on a present value basis). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Special rules and definitions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For purposes of this paragraph (a) the following special rules and definitions apply: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Available output. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The available output of a facility is determined by multiplying the number of units produced or to be produced by the facility in one year by the number of years in the contract term of the issue issued to finance that facility. The number of units produced or to be produced by a generating facility in one year is determined by reference to its nameplate capacity or the equivalent (or where there is no nameplate capacity or the equivalent, its maximum capacity) and is reduced to account for scheduled maintenance but not for reserves or other unutilized capacity. If nameplate capacity or the equivalent is greater than 150 percent of the average expected output during the contract term, average expected output is used in lieu of nameplate capacity. For transmission facilities and cogeneration facilities, available output must be measured in a reasonable manner. For example, for short, radial transmission lines, thermal capacity may be reasonable. Similarly, for a transmission network, the use of load share ratios, in a manner consistent with the requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, may be reasonable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Contract term. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The contract term of an issue begins on the date the output facility is placed in service (but not earlier than the issue date of the bonds), and ends on the final maturity date of the issue (determined without regard to any optional redemption dates.) If a contract may be extended by the owner of the facility, the term of the contract includes the period for which that contract may be so extended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Refundings and extensions of maturity. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In determining the contract term and debt service on an issue under paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (a)(3)(ii) of this section if, on or before the issue date of an issue to finance a facility, the issuer makes a commitment (for example, in the bond documents) to refund that issue with a refunding issue, the contract term and debt service are based on the final maturity date of any bond of the refunding issue (determined without regard to any optional redemption dates). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Take or take or pay contracts. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> take or pay contract  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> is a contract under which the purchaser agrees to pay for the output under the contract, whether or not that output is received by the purchaser. A  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> take <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  contract is a contract under which the purchaser agrees to pay for the output under the contract if the output facility is capable of providing the service. In the case of a transmission facility, both agreements to provide firm transmission services and agreements to provide transmission service comparable to the owner's own use are treated as a take or take or pay contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

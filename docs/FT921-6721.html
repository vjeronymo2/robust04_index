			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / MPs back break-up of rivers authority PROPOSALS for the break-up of the National Rivers Authority, the watchdog on river pollution, were backed by the influential Commons environment committee yesterday. Splitting the NRA, which has existed only two years, is one option being considered by the government in its moves to form a powerful national agency embracing most aspects of environmental protection. The NRA wants to keep its organisation intact and believes that if necessary it should be absorbed into the new agency as a whole. The cross-party committee, which has been examining the government's proposals, believes the NRA's responsibility for pollution control should be taken away and given to the new body. Sir Hugh Rossi, the committee chairman, said this would result in a 'lean, mean organisation responsible for environmental protection'. The size of the NRA staff is expected to rise to 8,000 this year. The committee estimates that if pollution control were taken from the NRA it would be deprived of 14 per cent of its budget and 19 per cent of its staff. The Conservatives, if returned to power, intend to introduce legislation in the autumn establishing the new national agency. In addition to all or part of the NRA, it would incorporate the Pollution Inspectorate. House of Commons Paper 55. HMSO. Pounds 23.80.</p>

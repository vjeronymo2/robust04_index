			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Friday prayers sermon by His Eminence Ayatollah Mohammad </F> Yazdi, head of the judiciary, in Tehran on 6 May--recorded]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, and compassionate.  Muslim brothers and sisters everywhere: A glance at the history  of Islam shows that the results of pressure by Islam's enemies  run counter to their expectations and serve to boost Islam's  promotion and progress. And injustices have drawn people's  attention to it. This is why Islam has made its way and assumed  its position in the world.    The Karbala' incident took place in the first century of the  hegira. This is the first proof of what we say. Then there  were the crusades in the middle ages and today we have the  Serbian crimes and their savage war and ethnic cleansing.    The other issue to which we draw the attention of the  Islamic  world is this: Had the events of Karbala' not occurred and the  corrupt ruler not committed those crimes against the followers  of the prophet, smearing the history of Islam, the world would  not have needed an advocate of culture, freedom, democracy, and  human rights.    The world, particularly Europe, today claims to be very  civilized and to have progressed. But disregarding  international organizations, the Serbians are committing the  ugliest and most tragic crimes against the Muslims of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, including killing, torturing, burning,  destroying, and slaughtering women, old people, and children.  These acts shame humanity. Members of the United Nations and  the Security Council have been turning a blind eye to these  crimes and even supporting them in practice in a manner that  pains the human conscience. What do you think? Is the result  what the enemy wants or is it in favor of Islam? Islam is  spreading against their will.    They usurped Palestine, displaced its people, and tortured  and killed its people. What do you think will happen  ultimately? Will the enemy achieve his objective or will he  force the Muslims to get ready to regain their strength over  their enemies? History shows that when the Muslims became aware  of the reasons for their weakness and defeat and followed the  path of struggle, they triumphed over the enemy. When they did  not care what happened to them, they remained for years the  prisoners of the enemy.    Muslim brothers and sisters: The conditions in the world  today are not the same as before. We must today defeat the  enemy through unity, new methods, and information. Meetings and  decisions by officials are useless these days. The oppressed  Bosnian and Palestinian peoples stood fast in the face of the  Serbs and the Zionists. In doing so, they dealt a devastating  blow to the United Nations and the Security Council. The  Islamic Conference Organization intervened. Work is continuing  secretly and openly.    'Arafat's treason and his recent signing of the disgraceful  agreement in Egypt have escalated the wave of strikes and armed  confrontation. General mourning was declared. The signing of  the agreements in Washington and Cairo had no effect, thanks to  the Palestinian resistance. This is the age of peoples, not  governments. It is time to regain the people's rights and  defend virtues, not time for laziness and indifference. We are  confident that we will triumph ultimately, thanks to the  vigilance and unity of the Muslims, God willing.</p>

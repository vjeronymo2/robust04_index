			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 5 (XINHUA) -- China is one of the  world's largest potential markets for autos, indicating that  both Chinese and foreign carmakers have a lot to do in this  sector.    This is the finding of a nationwide survey of 3,000 owners  of  Chinese-built cars over a period of three months. Results of  the survey, conducted by the State Statistical Bureau and the  China Automobile Industry Corporation, were announced here today.    Improvement in the Chinese people's living standards will  give a major push to the buying of family cars, the survey says.    It indicates that a growing number of well-to-do Chinese  have  bought cars for private use. And more and more autos are  expected to be driven home in China in the coming decades.    The survey shows that the most popular Chinese-built cars  are  the Audi from the China First Automobile Group Corporation  (CFAGC), the Santana from the Shanghai Volkswagen Auto  Corporation, Ltd. (SVAC), and the Jetta from the Fow-Volkswagen  Auto Corporation, Ltd. (FVAC) [name as received].    Heavy-duty trucks praised by consumers surveyed are the  Huanghe from the Jinan Heavy-Duty Motor Works (JHMW) and the  Jiefang from CFAGC, it says.    A few enterprises such as CFAGC and SVAC were valued by the  consumers as the best automobile enterprises in China.    China has 116 motor works, but their output and  manufacturing  technology lag behind world standards. The survey was aimed at  helping China's auto corporations to adapt to the market and  improve their manufacturing technology and quality so as to  raise their competence on the world market.    The auto industry, as one of the backbone industries in  China, has registered high growth in recent years. In 1993,  China produced 1.31 million autos, an increase of 20 percent  over 1992.    Statistics show that China had 8 million Chinese-built autos  by the end of 1993, 16 percent higher than the 1992 figure.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Sinn Fein President] Mr Adams's visit continued  to grab the headlines in New York today. His speech to the  National Committee on American Foreign Policy's Northern Ireland  conference was widely reported in the city's morning newspapers  and on coast-to-coast television channels. The tabloid NEW YORK  POST devoted a full page to Mr Adams and his movements and the  more sedate NEW YORK TIMES also had detailed and extensive  coverage.    Mr Adams was expected to maintain the publicity momentum  through further TV interviews before leaving for Dublin from New  York's Kennedy Airport tonight. He was also having further  talks today with Irish-American politicians and trade union  leaders sympathetic to the Irish republican cause.    Clearly cheered by the warmth of his welcome, Mr Adams was  planning to deliver a "farewell message" to the American people.    Meanwhile, U.S. political commentators highlighted the  possible harm done to Anglo-American relations by President  Clinton's decision to grant Mr Adams a visa. It was thought,  however, that the President might have compensated for any  damage done to the "special relationship" by swiftly making  clear last night that there would be no U.S. intervention on  Northern Ireland. [passage omitted]    Mr Adams ended his visit by claiming the publicity which  surrounded it was generated by the British Government. "Had  they never objected in the first place to me coming to the U.S.  and never tried to interfere with the affairs of the U.S., then  no one would have noticed when I got here," he told a news  conference. "They created the issue and brought it on  themselves by putting pressure on the American authorites."    Criticism levelled at him by [British Prime Minister] Mr  Major and [Foreign Secretary] Mr Hurd was contrived, he said.  "They are trying to ensure that when another visa application  is made it will cause more controversy. I think people here  will resist them. This is just the hysteria of the British  House of Commons." [passage omitted]    Mr Adams said Mr Clinton's decision to allow him a visa was  "the right thing to do, and a very sound gesture that makes the  right signals and creates the right climate." Asked whether the  cause of peace had been advanced by his visit, he declared: "It  is very, very hard to make peace. It requires two sides to make  up just as it requires two sides to make war." He insisted that  he wanted an end to violence in Northern Ireland.    The beginning of the news conference was marked by an  outburst of applause from a number of republican supporters in  the room with journalists.    Mr Adams flies back to Ireland later tonight. During his  final hours in New York he met trade union leaders and  politicians with an Irish interest.</p>

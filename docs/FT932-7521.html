			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Books: The great inquisitor OLIVER FRANKS by Alex Danchev Clarendon Press, Oxford Pounds 25, 256 pages ASKED ONCE who was the ablest man he had ever met outside politics, Attlee answered, 'Franks'. Many others - British, American or European - who were active in public affairs in the early post-war years would have agreed. A younger generation who may be puzzled by this judgment will understand it better when they have finished this appreciative but by no means hagiographic account of his life. Having been, like so many academics, drafted into Whitehall at the outset of the second world war, Franks showed an immediate talent for administration - a talent never seriously engaged either before or afterwards. By 1945 he had become, at the age of 40, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Supply when it employed over 400,000 people. Then, in 1947, he played a crucial part in the development and implementation of the Marshall Plan. First, in 15 hectic weeks of immense effort he produced, as Chairman of the newly formed Committee for European Economic Co-operation, a unanimous report with much supporting analysis on Europe's projected needs for dollars, both in aggregate and by individual country over the next four years. Then he went to Washington and, almost single-handed, persuaded the Americans to legislate a not too scaled-down version of these proposals. As a direct result of this resounding achievement he was appointed Ambassador to Washington in 1948. For the next four years his unusual combination of analytical ability, moral authority and neutrality of mind made him an outstandingly successful Ambassador. He was pivotal in the creation of NATO and in persuading the UK to join the US in the defence of South Korea. Dean Acheson came to regard him almost as a personal adviser and in Anglo/US negotiations at the highest level he was virtually accorded the status of Chairman. Apart from the tremendous 12 years 1940-1952 his career was relatively unremarkable. He was an academic philosopher for 12 years before the war; Chairman of Lloyds Bank from 1954 to 1962 and Provost of Worcester College, Oxford, from 1962 to 1976. He wrote extraordinarily little: one academic philosophical paper and an unmemorable set of Reith Lectures in 1954. Virtually nothing else. On the other hand, look at his 'shadow cv' - the posts he was offered and turned down: Secretary-General of NATO; Chairman of the National Coal Board, British Railways, British Petroleum, the Atomic Energy Authority; Director-General of the BBC; Headmaster of Harrow; Editor of The Times; Governor of the Bank of England. The Establishment clearly valued him and tried hard to get him to work for them. But he appears to have had a deep-seated reluctance to commit himself institutionally. It shows even in his religion, which was of the utmost importance to him. He was a life-long attender of Quaker meetings and married in a Quaker ceremony, but unlike his mother and his wife he never joined the Society of Friends. Outside his relatively short period of formal public service his powers found their greatest expression in inquisition. There were eight Franks Reports on subjects as diverse as Indian development plans and British business schools and including a massive inquiry Into Oxford University in 1960. They normally ended with clear recommendations arising logically from the mass of evidence lucidly marshalled. If sometimes those commissioning the reports were dIsinclined to accept their conclusions, that was not Franks' concern. His conduct of inquiries was legendary. His questions tended to be long, miraculously coherent summings-up of the Issues at stake or of the witness's previous answers, at the end of which many witnesses could do little but agree. (On one occasion the formidable Dame Evelyn Sharp was subjected to a particularly intricate question, delivered without notes and extending to three pages in the transcript. She asked if the question could be repeated. It was and proved identical in the transcript except for occasional phrases.) Alex Danchev has written an excellent, informative and thoughtful biography of this outstanding, puzzling man. The heart of it is naturally the early post-war years where the author is clearly at home with the background and provides an account of this seminal time that is both readable and well referenced. But the whole book is fascinating for the attempts - doomed by the nature of the subject to be ultimately unsuccessful - to understand and explain precisely what made Franks tick. Only in his account of the Falklands Inquiry may some readers feel let down. Danchev behaves as gingerly in assessing Franks and his colleagues as they themselves did in assessing the behaviour of all those from the Prime Minister downwards whose combined errors led to an avoidable disaster. Those looking for a more robust account can find it in Ian Gilmour's Dancing with Dogma.</p>

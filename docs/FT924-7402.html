			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / People: Nuclear link for McAlpine family company Sir Christopher Harding (right), chairman of BET, has joined the board of Newarthill, which controls the privately-owned construction business of Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons, re-establishing a connection which goes back to the days when he was chairman of British Nuclear Fuels. Sir Christopher, 53, says he had known the late Lord McAlpine of Moffat, a grandson of the founder and a leading figure in Britain's post-war nuclear power industry, for many years. He says his professional colleagues at BNFL had always had the highest regard for the quality of the company's nuclear power construction work. Newarthill, named after the Scottish birthplace of founder Sir Robert McAlpine, is the bigger, but more private, of the two construction companies connected with the McAlpine family. The family ownership of the Cheshire-based Alfred McAlpine is now down to 20 per cent and with last year's retirement of Bobby McAlpine from its chairmanship, the management of Alfred McAlpine has been largely transferred into the hands of outside professionals. However, Newarthill, which took itself private in 1989, is still controlled by the Southern end of the McAlpine family whose best-known member is Lord McAlpine of West Green, one of Lady Thatcher's closest advisers and an important Tory party fund-raiser. Sir John Hedley Greenborough, 70, a former senior Shell executive, has been chairman since 1980, but with the death of Sir Robert Fairbairn, a former chairman of Clydesdale Bank, and Sir Norman Elliott, a former chairman of the Electricity Council, the rest of the board is made up of increasingly elderly family members. In addition to Sir Chris-topher, George Grover, 65, a former senior partner of Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, has also joined the board. Newarthill, which has lost considerably more money than its quoted sister company since it went private, says there is no special significance in their appointment. It simply restores the position to having three non-family members on the board. However, one of the reasons why Sir Christopher may have been picked is that he is well versed in the ways of family companies, having been a director of Lord Hanson's family-owned transport business since 1974.

			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / SE Banken up on rights talk TRADING in the shares of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the Swedish bank, was exceptionally heavy yesterday on expectations that the loss-making group will today announce a large rights issue and much improved financial figures for the second quarter. The bank is set to ask shareholders for as much as SKr6bn (Pounds 502.8m) through a one-for-two share issue at SKr45 per share, according to one report. This is a larger amount than earlier expected and should enable the bank to survive its current difficulties without direct state support, say analysts. The bank yesterday declined to comment. A rights issue has been expected since the bank and the Swedish government announced in June that the bank's owners would be called on to strengthen the bank's capital base. Raising SKr6bn would boost the bank's international capital adequacy ratio from 8.5 per cent at the end of the first quarter to 10.5-11 per cent, well above the minimum 8 per cent level. Analysts say conditions for a rights issue are highly favourable given falling Swedish interest rates and the surge in SE Banken's share price. The shares have climbed nearly 10 times from SKr7 in April to SKr69 yesterday, after gaining new momentum at the end of last week as rumours of a rights issue began to circulate. Turnover in the A shares amounted to SKr198m on the Stockholm Stock Exchange yesterday. An important consideration for the bank will be the extent to which its leading shareholders agree to support the fund-raising to generate the wider confidence required to make the issue a success. The main shareholders include the Wallenberg family, with around 7 per cent, Trygg-Hansa SPP, the insurance group, and Custos, the investment group. Some analysts believe the bank could announce a near break-even result after credit losses for the second quarter, which would keep losses for the first half in the SKr500-700m range. In the first quarter, the bank announced an SKr608m operating loss, down 55 per cent on the same 1992 period.</p>

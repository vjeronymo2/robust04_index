			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Apr 06, BNS -- Latvian Foreign Ministry  demands that Russian Ambassador Aleksndr Rannikh gave by April 7  explanations to Russian President Boris Yeltsin's April 5 order  to set up military bases in several countries, including Latvia.    The Latvian Foreign Ministry protests against Russia's  intentions to set up Russian army military bases in CIS states  and Latvia to guarantee the security of the above mentioned  states and Russia, as well as to test new arms and military  equipment. Russia's decision contradicts with the agreement,  reached during the Latvian-Russian interstate talks.    Yeltsin has ordered Russian Defense Ministry and other  interested institutions to start talks with the CIS states and  Latvia on signing the appropriate documents.    The Latvian Cabinet plans to hold an extraordinary meeting  Wednesday [6 April] evening in Jurmala to adopt an official  governmental announcement on Yeltsin's above mentioned order.</p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / MoD seeks hovercraft bids THE MINISTRY of Defence plans to revive the use of hovercraft after abandoning them in the 1980s. It is inviting tenders for up to four diesel-engined hovercraft to start service with the Royal Marines by the end of next year. Main UK contenders for the contract, expected to be worth about Pounds 1m, are Griffon Hovercraft, which has recently clinched export deals for Sweden and Thailand, and Slingsby Aviation. Among others invited to bid is an Australian company, Airlift Marine. Five French companies are also due to be notified. The US and Russia make significant use of hovercraft for amphibious operations. The UK set up an inter-service trials unit in the 1960s, but the gas-turbine craft of the time were found to be too unreliable, noisy and expensive. The MoD said modern technology had largely overcome those drawbacks. The planned craft, much smaller than the US marines' tank-carrying Landing Craft Air Cushion, will carry up to 16 fully equipped men or two tonnes of stores over sea, land or ice at up to 30 knots. Conventional landing craft will still be needed to transport vehicles, heavy equipment and the main body of troops ashore.</p>

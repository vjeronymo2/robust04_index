			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Life sector is set data standard Life insurance companies will have to provide information on a standard basis about how many people buying long-term policies give them up early, according to rules published yesterday by their regulator. The move will mean figures will be collected across the financial services sector in a common format for the first time, enabling comparisons to be made between different companies and different methods of selling. The first statistics from this exercise are likely to be out in the autumn. If investors surrender policies in the first few years, it does not necessarily mean that they were badly advised. But there would be questions about whether suitable advice was being provided if many of a company's customers gave up long-term investments soon after buying them. The Personal Investment Authority (PIA), the watchdog to protect the private investor, has so far stopped short of insisting that figures for individual companies be published, but it is now moving in that direction, in the teeth of opposition from some companies. Next year it will consult member companies on requiring life offices to make their statistics publicly available. In the meantime, it will encourage them to do so. Until now there has been no authoritative basis for calculating lapse rates, which has made it easier for life companies to avoid being put on the spot. Anecdotal evidence suggests that lapse rates reached their highest levels in the early 1990s but are coming down slightly as companies develop more flexible products. Even so, life companies still sound apprehensive about a report expected next month from the Office of Fair Trading on endowment policies which will highlight both lapse rates and the poor values that some companies provide to people who surrender a policy prematurely. By the end of June this year, life companies will have to provide the PIA with lapse rates broken down by five types of life and pensions policies and by four methods of selling, such as through a sales force or through independent advisers. From 1996 onwards, the returns will have to be provided by the end of April. The PIA's move comes against a background of regulatory pressure for greater openness in retail financial services. From the beginning of next year, sales agents and independent advisers will have to give customers more information about the policies they sell, their charges, and the commission earned on the sale.</p>

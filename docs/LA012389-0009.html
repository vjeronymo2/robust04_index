			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'PALESTINE NEEDS A STATE, TOO'  </P> <P> As one who treasures my friendship with Philip M. Klutznick, and enjoys a  continuous exchange of views and information, I'll observe with great interest  how the Jewish "establishment" spokespersons will react to his sage advice as  to negotiations with the PLO in Israel's need for peace ("Palestine Needs a  State, Too," Op-Ed Page, Jan. 10). Will they distribute Phil's opinion piece to  their constituency for independent judgment(s), or skewer his remarks?  </P> <P> If the treatment Stanley Sheinbaum and the others in the "Stockholm five"  received is any example, Klutznick will be the target of abuse and distortion  of purpose. Few people in the Jewish, as well as general community, know that  these American Jews who went to Sweden to meet with PLO leader Yasser Arafat  were representatives of the highly respected International Center for Peace in  the Middle East. Its current chairperson is Abba Eban whose skills and talents  have been certified by his work in the United Nations, as Israel's ambassador  to the United States, and its foreign minister. Nahumm Goldmann and Klutznick  were among the founders of the Center for Peace as these Jewish statesmen  realized Israel's future was at stake by continuous warfare, regardless of the  finger-pointing on who's at fault.  </P> <P> I can only echo what Klutznick writes: "Now is the time to make peace . . . to  talk."  </P> <P> In a nuclear age, it's either peace under mutually acceptable conditions, and  enforced agreements, or the continued march to the eventual day of world  suicide.  </P> <P> HYMAN H. HAVES  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

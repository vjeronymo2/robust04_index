			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Chairman of Welsh agency resigns The chairman of a government-funded Welsh development agency has resigned in response to a critical report published yesterday by the Commons public accounts committee. In the latest embarrassment for Welsh quangos, the committee condemned a housing policy and car leasing scheme run by the Development Board for Rural Wales. Mr Glyn Davies, the agency's chairman, said in his resignation letter: 'I hope this action will enable the DBRW to recover from any damaging effect resulting from external criticisms.' The board, which has 120 staff and a grant this year of nearly Pounds 17m, had illegally allocated houses under two sets of rules, one published and the other unpublished. Its housing officer and his ex-wife were housed under the unpublished rules when they would not have otherwise qualified. 'It was wholly unacceptable,' the MPs said, 'for any public authority to publish a policy for the information of the public and then operate on a totally different basis.' It reflected badly on all concerned that for 13 years no one appeared to realise the DBRW was failing to comply with the housing acts. It was also unacceptable that a car leasing scheme had been amended without consulting the Welsh Office. The MPs said they 'were very surprised that, given the nature and scale of maladministration' the board had decided not to take disciplinary action. Accepting Mr Davies' resignation, Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, said the board had made a significant contribution to the economic and social development of mid-Wales. 'I do, however, entirely understand your wish in the light of recent events that public confidence in the board should be quickly restored.' Mr Redwood is already reviewing the DBRW's future and it is expected it may be subsumed into the Welsh Development Agency. Mr Davies, who had been chairman for seven years, said he also resigned his membership of the WDA, Wales Tourist Board and Welsh Economic Council. The Commons committee last year strongly censured the WDA.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Relatives of trawler crew sue its owner Relatives of the crew of the lost fishing trawler Pescado have started civil proceedings against the owner of the vessel, which sank with the loss of all six aboard 13 miles off Falmouth, Cornwall, in February 1991. A writ issued in the High Court alleges that the 22-metre, 60-tonne vessel was operated by the owner at a standard below that expected of a competent operator. Their solicitor said it also alleged negligence and breach of duty of care of its employees. The action has been taken by Mrs Rita Capon, whose daughter Jo-Anne was the vessel's cook, and Mrs Mary Curry, whose son Neil was Jo-Anne's fiance. The Plymouth-based Pescado was raised 240ft from the seabed last September in a Pounds 220,000 operation financed by the Devon and Cornwall police after Cornwall coroner Mr David Bruce called for an inquiry. This has been completed and is being considered by Devon and Cornwall Chief Constable John Evans. Mr Alan Ayres, a shareholder in Guideday, the Plymouth company which owns the vessel, said yesterday he would defend the civil allegations vigorously. He has always claimed the Pescado was sunk by a submarine. This has been denied by the Ministry of Defence. A report from the marine accident investigation branch of the Department of Transport believed the vessel went down after snagging her nets.</p>

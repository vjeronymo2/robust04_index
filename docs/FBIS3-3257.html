All of the 30,000 tonnes of ammonium bicarbonate in  stock has been sold out, and the average amount of ammonium  bicarbonate bought by each peasant household in the county has  reached about 1 tonne. However, the line of vehicles waiting to  buy fertilizers at the gate of the plant is still growing.    At the Qianchang Town Seed Center, there is also a long line  of people waiting to buy seeds. The director of the center said  happily: "At this time last year, not even one catty of grain  seeds had been sold. This year, 90,000 kg of 135,000 kg of  hybrid grain seeds scheduled for sale during the whole year have  been sold." The whole county's situation is even better. The  accumulated total of grain seeds bought by peasants has exceeded  500,000 kg, equivalent to over 80 percent of the amount used  last year.    Last winter, although the government adopted measures to  stabilize and lower grain prices, grain prices still went up to  a certain extent. This has caused a craze to grow grain, has  injected vitality into the development of the rural economy, and  also put forward a new task of readjusting the agriculture  structure.    Pei Lianggeng, a major grain grower in Jingshan, has already  bought all the grain seeds he needs this year. County and town  leaders concerned suggested that he should put aside some  farmland to grow lotus and other cash crops. Pei Lianggeng said  very reluctantly: "At present, grain prices are so good and you  are asking me to grow this and to try my luck blindly. I have  no experience in growing cash crops and even if I have, I am not  willing to do this. Who does not know that one should grow  something with a rising price? In Jingshan County, peasants  with this way of thinking are not in the minority.    Jingshan County is famous for growing grains and the per  capita grain sold and its percentage of commodity grains have  ranked first in the province for 10 consecutive years. Last  year, the output value of grain, cotton, and edible oil was more  than that of diversified management for the first time. Will  this percentage be reversed this year? Duan Xianbin, deputy  secretary of the Jingshan County CPC Committee and who is in  charge of agriculture, said with a heavy heart: "The rise of  grain prices has given a guide to the peasants. Viewed from the  situation of the spring farming this year, some peasants have  staked this year's bumper harvest on growing grains. Some  peasants who are growing other crops or have engaged in the  breeding trade also feel regretful and are ready to grow grains  again." How should we look at this?</p>

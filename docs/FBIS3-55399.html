He told INTERFAX that "these documents  enable Moldova and Transdniestria to do business with former  Soviet republics." Marakutsa emphasized that "Transdniestria  wants Moldova to sign the collective security treaty, which it  refused to do."    In his view, the Transdniestrian conflict cannot be resolved  unless Moldova, Transdniestria and Gagauzia make a federation or  confederation within the framework of the former Moldovan SSR.  "Everybody, notably Ukraine and Russia, wants the existing  borders of Moldova to be preserved while its internal structure  is the republic's internal affair," he said.    Marakutsa ruled out the possibility of handing over the  Ilascu group convicted by the Tiraspol court to Moldova.    In early December 1993, the TMR Supreme Court sentenced Ilie  Ilascu, the leader of the Tiraspol branch of the Moldovan  Christian Democratic Popular Front, to death on charges of  terrorism while his five comrades were sentenced to different  prison terms.    "In Kishinev, Ilascu and his men are regarded as patriots,  not terrorists," Marakutsa said. "For this reason we are not  sure that a new trial will take place there." He said that  Transdniestria would welcome a retrial by an independent court  with Russian or Ukrainian judges.    Marakutsa denied reports that he pressed for resignation of  Aleksandr Lebed, commander of the 14th Russian Army. "We have  different political views on numerous problems but this does not  imply that one of us should resign," he said.</p>

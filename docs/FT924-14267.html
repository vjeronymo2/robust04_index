			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Separate taxation HAS THE change to separate taxation of husband and wife affected the carrying forward of losses on share dealings to offset future capital gains in excess of the capital gains allowance? Can I now separate the capital losses of my wife and myself for past years and set these against our separate future (hoped for) capital gains in excess of the allowance? Is there any time limit on carrying forward capital losses? Yes - the former rule which enabled a husband to obtain CGT relief for his wife's losses and vice versa (subject to the other spouse's tacit consent) was abolished with effect from the end of 1989-90. Allowable losses which accrued at any time in the past can be set against current chargeable gains. Section 2(2) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 says: 'Capital gains tax shall be charged on the total amount of chargeable gains accruing to the person chargeable in the year of assessment, after deducting (a) any allowable losses accruing to that person in that year of assessment, and (b) so far as they have not been allowed as a deduction from chargeable gains accruing in any previous year of assessment, any allowable losses accruing to that person in any previous year of assessment (not earlier than the year 1965-66).' There is no procedure for agreeing the amount of any allowable loss until the year in which it is actually set against chargeable gains. All relevant data and papers should, therefore, be retained. The courts have confirmed that a tax inspector is not bound by any informal agreement of allowable losses available to be carried forward. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT15 - Capital Gains Tax: a Guide for Married Couples. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

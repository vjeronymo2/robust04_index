			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has said  political stability and liberal economic policies offer vast  opportunities for foreign investment in Pakistan. Speaking at a  dinner hosted by the World Economic Forum in Davos last night,  she highlighted the scope of foreign investment and the program  of privatization by her government.    [Begin Bhutto recording] Pakistan is a confident nation. We  have no inhibition to restrict the scope of economic relations  with foreigners on mutually advantageous basis. Today we are an  interdependent world, we are not an isolated world, and the  confidence of international financial institutions demonstrates  that Pakistan today is well on the road of political stability  and economic stability, and therefore a good place for foreign  investors to look to. The investors' confidence in Pakistan can  be seen from the fact that (?well) in New York a Pakistan fund  was open. It is oversubscribed three times, by three times.  So, now we are thinking of opening another fund or issuing  government securities. Not only was the Pakistan fund  oversubscribed, but the stock market has been rising and rising.  Pakistan today offers the most lucrative investment  opportunities in major infrastructure projects. We have charted  out a highly ambitious energy sector development plan, in which  some $10 billion are likely to be invested over the next five  years. We have made this an almost exclusive domain of the  private sector, particularly foreign investors. Needless to say  our optimism is based on the successful initiation of  implementation work on the Hab power project which is a foreign  private initiative costing $2 billion. In fact, this is the  largest World Bank-funded private power project anywhere in the  world today. [applause] [end recording]    The prime minister also highlighted Pakistan's geographical  location which can open new vistas toward greater and better  relations with the Central Asian countries.    In Davos today, the Turkish president, Suleyman Demirel,  hosted a working breakfast which was also attended by Prime  Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto and President Nazarbayev of  Turkmenistan and President Karimov of Uzbekistan. The leaders  of the ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization] countries  exchanged views for better cooperation among the  member-countries. The leaders reviewed the existing links  between the member-countries and identified areas where possible  ties of further cooperation can be explored.    The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, also held a meeting  with the senior minister of Singapore, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, in  Davos today. During the meeting, the prime minister and the  Singapore minister discussed various issues in the fields of  economics, commerce, and trade, and possibilities for raising a  sound infrastructure in Pakistan, which can attract foreign  investments. The prime minister briefed Mr. Lee about the  economic policies of her government. [passage omitted]</p>

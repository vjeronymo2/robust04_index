			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Arts: Less talk, more action on the government front - Architecture The Royal Fine Art Commission has issued an important little yellow book with a catchy title, Medicis and the Millennium? Government Patronage and Architecture. It is modestly written by Judy Hillman - a veteran planning and architectural writer - and modestly produced. It says a lot of things that have often been said before but nonetheless need repeating, and repeating until they are really understood, about the need for Government to build only to the highest quality of design. We seem to need special events and anniversaries to concentrate the official mind, and the current focus on the approaching millennium is as good a reason as any to think about the quality of Britain's buildings and cities for the long term future. Rumours abound about what is in the mind of the new Minister in the cabinet with special responsibilities for the National Heritage. Last week there was press speculation about a new national opera house which might be built on London's South Bank to house both the Royal Opera Company and the English National Opera. This seems, to say the least, a curious idea at precisely the moment the two companies are launching major appeals for development funds to improve their existing premises. Mr Mellor's dream of a great millennium monument to be funded by the Government will, like everything the Government does, need Treasury approval. Is it perhaps the hope that the proposed national lottery will suddenly produce a flood of funds to enable the government to be generous to architecture and the arts? At present it looks as though the Treasury have still got a lot of decisions to make about the lottery, its tax status, and the ultimate destination of the funds. There are four likely destinations. The Millennium Fund optimistically hopes to pay for every important public building in the country to be restored and refurbished. Exactly how this is to happen is not clear. As one of the destinations for lottery cash the Millennium Fund could soon consume most of the money. The arts in general are to be beneficiaries, as is sport. The National Heritage - presumably through the excellent National Heritage Memorial Fund - is the likely fourth beneficiary. It can be seen that there is no shortage of clients to spend the nation's betting profits. And there will be no shortage of advice for ministers from quangoes like the Royal Fine Art Commission and a whole range of artistic beggars. But pious wishes are no substitute for planning and action. The millennium is very close and if ministers in this government want to leave the nation some more substantial monuments than a Canary Wharf full of unhappy civil servants and acres of empty offices, then a coherent and effective plan is needed. Establishing priorities is essential and there are some obvious ones. Improvement in the quality of the homes of the people should take first place over everything else ; this is seldom mentioned by anyone except the Prince of Wales. I recently asked a young friend what he would like to see to mark the millennium and his reply was very clear. He thought that the demolition and replacement of all the unsatisfactory tower blocks of the 1960's should be any government's top priority. The recent publication of the report by the Urban Villages Group offers serious and careful alternatives for the enhancement of living and working conditions in our cities. This could be a key to action. Once the daily lives of the majority are actively improved by better housing and improved infrastructure, then the nation can afford to contemplate the arts and heritage and the building of monuments to ministers. The much lauded grands projet in Paris have not grown up without considerable careful redevelopment of whole quartiers of the city and a new town programme. I am sure that Mr Mellor does not need my advice but on the cultural front it might be helpful to widen the discussion beyond provision of new facilities for the performing arts. Both the national opera houses in London need substantial government help; an end to the tedious round of begging should be Mr Mellor's immediate priority. Then a national home for dance is clearly lacking and could easily be provided. Once he has settled those requirements Mr Mellor must take a look at the visual arts. The nation needs a major, well designed and air-conditioned exhibition space to catch the great exhibitions that tour the world and only get as far as Paris. We need a finely designed Grand Palais in London - so that shows like Gaugin, Seurat and many others do come across the Channel. There is a real need for more space for contemporary art: the distressing fact that only some 20 per cent of the Tate Gallery's collection can be shown to the public is an indication of how bad things are in that area. At the Victoria and Albert Museum, only a fraction of its great collections can be permanently shown in the main museum. There is clearly scope for some rationalisation of national collections and in fields like architectural drawings there is still no national policy. Landscape is an area that is not mentioned in the Royal Fine Art Commission's little yellow book, but it is a key area that should not be separated from architecture. It is also an area where the expenditure of a little money could have a big effect. Gardens and landscape need as much help as buildings and artifacts from the heritage funds. I have a feeling that Mr Mellor is the kind of minister who takes decisions rather than advice. He could give us a welcome break from more committees, quangoes and endless talk about the millennium. Since he is flatteringly being compared with the Medicis by the Royal Fine Art Commission, perhaps he might appreciate the words of Duke Cosimo I de' Medici, when he was trying to stop all the pointless arguments at his Florentine Academy of Design: 'His Excellency says to carry on with the work and not with words, and not to pay heed to so much babble and humbug, because that is the way not of getting things done but merely of spreading scandal.' Can we expect less talk about the millennium and look to Mr Mellor for more action.? Medicis and the Millennium? Judy Hillman. RFAC/HMSO Pounds 7.95.</p>

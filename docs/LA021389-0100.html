			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED  </P> <P> The most recent Los Angeles Times Poll consisted of more than 80 questions  asked of a scientific sampling of 2,116 people in Southern California,  including 206 in Orange County.  </P> <P> The poll was conducted Jan. 12-14 by telephone interviewers, some of them  speaking Spanish. The sampling in Orange County was too small to break down the  responses by race or ethnic group.  </P> <P> The margin of error from chance variations in the sample was 3 points for the  responses from all of Southern California. For Orange County, it was 8 points,  and it was 4 points for Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The margin of error accounts for differences that would have been discovered if  every person had been interviewed.  </P></p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Hamilton successor seems safe choice Mr John Major yesterday chose a 44-year-old Welsh MP to replace Mr Neil Hamilton, the corporate affairs minister, who resigned earlier this week. The prime minister appointed Mr Jonathan Evans, the MP for Brecon and Radnor, to the post after deliberating for two days over how to fill the vacancy at the Department of Trade and Industry. Backbench Tory MPs believe that, amid continuing allegations of sleaze against ministers, Mr Major would have been keen to ensure that the new minister enjoyed a spotless record as an MP. Against this background Mr Evans appears a particularly safe choice. He entered parliament at the last election and, apart from his legal practice, did no remunerated work outside the House of Commons last year. The Commons' Register of Members Interests for the last parliamentary session shows that his only consultancy was as an unpaid adviser to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Mr Evans was at the centre of a minor political storm earlier this year, however, when he resigned from the government over the proposed reform of Welsh local authorities. He quit his unpaid post as a parliamentary private secretary to Sir John Wheeler, the Northern Ireland minister, and led a backbench revolt resulting in a government defeat in a Commons committee. He and another MP complained that the government had broken a promise made in the approach to the 1992 general election to replace the existing two-tier system of county and district authorities with a single tier of councils. DTI officials would not confirm yesterday that Mr Evans would definitely take over Mr Hamilton's responsibilities for corporate affairs and deregulation. The government may take the opportunity to divide the responsibilities of junior ministers.</p>

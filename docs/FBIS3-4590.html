			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seven members of the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] nuclear inspection team will depart Vienna for  Pyongyang at 1040 [1340 GMT] tonight, in about an hour and 30  minutes from now. Breaking its previous practice of issuing  visas only in Beijing, North Korea issued visas through the  North Korean Embassy in Vienna on the afternoon of 26 February.  Correspondent Cha Man-sun reports from Vienna:    [Begin Cha recording] The North Korean attitude toward the  inspection team, which has been somewhat leery, is gradually  relaxing. Breaking its previous practice of issuing visas only  in Beijing, North Korea promptly issued visas through the North  Korean Embassy in Vienna yesterday. In the past, when the  number of inspection team members exceeded three, North Korea  has demanded that the group be reduced. This time, however,  North Korea issued visas to all seven members as demanded by the  IAEA.    The IAEA expressed satisfaction with the North Korean  follow-up steps, although delayed, and expressed the hope that  North Korea will actively cooperate with the inspection team's  activities.    The inspection team will depart Vienna for Beijing at 1040  tonight, Korean time, by Lufthansa, and will stay overnight in  Beijing. The team will leave Beijing on 1 March by Koryo  Airline and will arrive in Pyongyang at around 1730, Korean  time. As soon as it arrives in Pyongyang, the inspection team  will arrange the dates of inspection in Yongbyon and Pyongyang  with relevant officials of the North Korean Ministry of Atomic  Power Industry, and will launch a full-fledged two-week  inspection of seven nuclear facilities beginning 2 March. This  means that overall inspections of North Korea are revived and  resumed nearly after a one year suspension. [end recording]</p>

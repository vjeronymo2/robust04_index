			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Straw softens hostility to grant-maintained schools IN A marked post-election shift in education policy, the Labour party significantly softened its hostility to opted-out schools yesterday and raised the possibility of local referenda to determine the future shape of education provision. Mr Jack Straw, shadow education secretary, described opting out as 'an essentially anarchic process', but warned that Labour should 'not appear to be placed in a hostile position' to parents making decisions about the best future for their children. Labour used its first education policy statement since the election to call on local education authorities to adopt an evenhanded approach in their dealings with grant-maintained schools. The party reiterated its opposition to opting out, saying it would reduce parental choice, disrupt management and result in the reintroduction of 'selection by the back door'. It advised local education authorities (LEAs) to summon conferences of head teachers 'urgently' to discuss 'whether an approach can be agreed with all schools in their area'. Labour opposed moves in some LEAs for secondary schools to opt out as a group, emphasising its commitment to changing the role of the LEA from that of provider 'to that of facilitator and enabler for the consumers - parents, students and pupils'. Labour envisages a new contract between education authorities and schools, by which councils would provide services - such as transport and in-service training - on a contractual basis to a 'mixed economy' of church, opted-out, and independent schools in their area. 'The elected member will become less a manager of services and much more an advocate for the community,' the party says. Only 240 of the 25,000 schools in England and Wales are grant-maintained, but with the future of opting-out assured, a rapid increase in parental ballots on opting out is expected. Mr John Patten, education secretary, welcomed Labour's 'capitulation' over opting-out. 'It has been persuaded by thousands of parents, teachers and school governors voting with their feet and taking their schools out of the stranglehold of local education authority control,' he said.</p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CPC PLANS TO BUY HOSPITAL, HEALTH FIRM;  </P> <P> ACQUISITIONS: COMPANY ALSO ANNOUNCES THAT ADMISSIONS AT TWO OF ITS FACILITIES  DECLINED 2% IN FIRST QUARTER.  </P> <P> Community Psychiatric Centers said Tuesday that it has tentatively agreed to  buy Brea Neuropsychiatric Hospital and a West German mental health management  company, and also disclosed that admissions at its hospitals dipped slightly in  its first quarter.  </P> <P> Terms of both proposed acquisitions were not disclosed.  </P> <P> The news concerning the nearly 2% decline in hospital admissions prompted a  4.7% decline in the Laguna Hills-based company's stock amid unusually heavy  trading, analysts said. CPC's stock fell $1.125 to close Tuesday at a 52-week  low of $21.875 per share, with 1.2 million shares changing hands.  </P> <P> "I think CPC is the best-managed company in the hospital services industry.  They have a proven record of over 20 years of posting improved earnings," said  Peter Sidoti, an analyst with the investment banking firm of County NatWest in  New York. "The question now is whether they will be able to keep it up. It's my  belief they will have a tough time."  </P> <P> CPC Chairman James Conte vehemently disagreed Tuesday, saying the company is  successfully fending off such industrywide problems as increasing competition  and a crackdown by insurers on costs, particularly those attached to mental  health. CPC is additionally facing a decline in admissions in adolescent drug  treatment programs because of a recent spate of negative publicity surrounding  such programs at other companies.  </P> <P> He said CPC recently raised its rates approximately 8% and is predicting  another year of improved earnings.  </P> <P> Beyond a slight industry downturn, Conte blamed the admissions decline at CPC  on an increase in the number of hospitals and a slowdown in specific markets.  </P> <P> The increase in admissions at CPC's established hospitals -- those open for  more than a year -- has been declining for nearly a year. The growth in  admissions has fallen from a high of 16.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 1989  to a 1.8% decline in fiscal 1990.  </P> <P> Conte said Tuesday that he expects the acquisition of Harvard Medical Services  to offset the decline in new patients at existing hospitals.  </P> <P> The Frankfurt, West Germany, firm contracts with U.S. armed forces and  corporations in Western Europe as a psychiatric referral service. The company  arranges psychiatric care in the United States for individuals returning home  because of illness.  </P> <P> CPC expects to pick up 90% of Harvard's referrals, which would increase  admissions.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Comprehensive Care Corp., the ailing alcohol- and drug-treatment  company formerly headquartered in Irvine, has agreed to sell to CPC its newly  constructed 152-bed Brea Neuropsychiatric Hospital.  </P> <P> Conte said he would install CPC management there and probably change the  hospital's name.  </P> <P> Some former administrators at Brea Neuropsychiatric have alleged in lawsuits  filed against Comp Care that deep budget cuts had ravaged patient care there.  The suits -- filed within the last three years -- claimed that cost-cutting was  responsible for one unattended patient's death from a drug overdose, an  attempted suicide and a homosexual gang rape of a teen-ager.  </P> <P> Comp Care has denied all of the charges in the past and defended the quality of  patient care provided at the Brea facility.  </P> <P> ADMISSIONS AT CPC HOSPITALS  </P> <P> Here, in percentages, are the figures showing the quarterly change in  admissions at established Community Psychiatric Centers in relation to the  comparable year-ago period.  </P> <P> Feb. 1989: 16.4%. May 1989: 13.2%. Aug. 1989: 5.4%. Nov.: 1989: 3.6%. Feb.  1990: -1.8%.  </P> <P> Source: Community Psychaitric Centers  </P></p>

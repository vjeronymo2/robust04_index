			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Perspectives: Internet's surf city, here we come - Computing / First get a modem writes Paul Taylor, in the first of a series on how to get connected to online databases Judging from the rash of newspaper and magazine articles about the Internet recently, it seems as if almost everyone with a personal computer is dialling up, logging on and 'surfing the net'. In the UK alone, three new magazines dealing with the Internet - the informal system of computer networks which connects databases and computers across the globe - have been launched in the past two months. Subscriptions to organisations which provide Internet access are rising by more than 10 per cent a month and sales of modems, the electronic devices that enable personal computers to communicate over a telephone line, are soaring. But, for many owners of personal computers, the online world remains a mysterious and intimidating environment of technobabble and acronyms. The first step to entering this world is selecting a modem. There are two forms of modem - internal and external. Internal modems plug into one of the spare card slots found inside most PCs, while external modems are connected to the PC's communications or serial port by a cable. Both need to be plugged into a spare telephone socket. For anyone buying a new computer and intending to explore the online world it makes sense to buy a machine with an internal modem already installed. If you are planning to add a modem to an existing PC set-up the conventional wisdom is that external modems are easier to install and monitor because they are more accessible. Installing an internal modem means opening up the PC and plugging in the card. But the advantages of an internal modem are that it does not take up extra desk space and it will include the high-speed chips that handle communications between the latest high-speed modems and the microprocessor 'brain' of the PC. Some fast external modems may still need a special high-speed serial card installed inside the PC. The other crucial decision for would-be PC communicators is how fast a modem to buy. One simple answer is the fastest one you can afford. Modems are rated according to how quickly they can exchange data over a telephone line. A modem's speed is expressed either in terms of its baud rate - which, at lower speeds, is roughly equivalent to bits (of data) per second - or by reference to the V series standards which have been set by the international telecommunications authorities. The most common modem speeds are: V22 or 1,200 baud, V22bis or 2,400 baud, V32 or 9,600 baud, V32bis or 14,400 baud and the latest standard, V34 or 28,800 baud. Each step up effectively doubles the modem speed and therefore halves the amount of time it takes to send a particular message across a telephone wire. Faster speed means less waiting for files to be transfered and, in most places, other than the US where local telephone calls are free, cheaper telephone bills. Until recently, many modems - and most online databases - only operated at a speed of 1,200 baud or 2,400 baud. However the current business standard is for data transmission at 14,400bps and the modem purchaser today should aim to buy a modem capable of this speed. Modems used to be expensive, partly because telecommunications authorities in many countries insisted on their own testing procedures before they would allow equipment to be connected to their networks. In the UK, modem designs must be tested. Approved modems carry a green British Approvals Board for Telecommunications (Babt) sticker. In the past, many modem manufacturers used this requirement as an excuse to charge premium prices. However a flood of 'illegal' imports from overseas which did not carry the Babt sticker but nevertheless worked perfectly well, forced modem manufacturers to reasses their pricing policies. As a result, Babt-approved modem prices in Britain have fallen sharply over the past year and a fast 14,400 baud modem from a mainstream manufacturer such as US Robotics, Zoom, Dataflex, MultiTech or Pace can now be bought through a magazine advertisement for Pounds 150 or less. Once you have bought a modem, the next task is to connect it to your PC. Most modems are factory pre-set to respond to signals sent by the microprocessor to the Coms 2 port of the PC - on many PCs the mouse is connected to the Coms 1 port. If, however, the modem is pre-set for a different port, or the Coms 2 port is already occupied by another device, it may be necessary to reset tiny switches on the modem called 'jumpers'. The documentation that comes with the modem you buy will explain how to do this. The communications software - which determines how the two modems talk to each other - will also need to be set up for the correct communications port. Any PC owner running Microsoft Windows already owns a basic PC communications software package called Terminal which enables a modem connection to be established and governs the communications 'protocol' between two computers. For the more ambitious, software suites such as Microsoft Works also include communications software. Even more sophisticated software packages such as Mirror III, Procomm Plus or Hayes Smartcom are also available, at a cost of about Pounds 50. Many modems are now sold with communications software, and sometimes with introductory membership to an online service such as Compuserve or Delphi. Compuserve, one of the largest online services, like most of the other US-based online service providers, supplies its own dedicated Windows communications software. Compuserve's is called WinCim. However a standard communications package is all that is needed to log on to many of the hundreds of private or commercial bulletin board systems. For full access to the Internet, additional communications software, available from most Internet service providers, may also be needed. Next week: Signing up with online services.</p>

The first action the EC commission has taken since new  year's  day was to work out a lengthy list which covers a wide-range of  foreign goods and adopt broad anti-dumping measures which are of  long-term duration, according to EC officials.    The commission has also voted to keep up the momentum of a  package of anti-dumping measures adopted five years ago.    The anti-dumping list, put forward by the EC commission  Monday, covers polyester fibers manufactured by South Korea,  Turkey and Taiwan and ferrosilicon from Norway, Iceland, Sweden  and Venezuela.    Chinese made photo-albums, lighters and paracetamol (a kind  of aspirin) are also included in the list.    Apart from albums, a number of other Chinese goods have been  placed under permanent anti-dumping tariffs since 1988.    Under relevant EC laws, "permanent anti-dumping measures"  are  normally effective for a term of five years and the EC  commission decides to continue or cancel the measures when they  reach the end of the five-year term, in accordance with changes  in the marketplace.    The term "market changes" here normally means that under  strict anti-dumping measures, the competitiveness of foreign  goods is greatly weakened and imported goods are taking an  increasingly smaller share of the EC market.    The anti-dumping measures in the past either generally  expired or were reduced at the end of the five-year term if they  genuinely achieved the desired target.    But, as the EC is still locked in a serious recession and  there is no sign of recovery, the EC commission has decided to  maintain or prolong the anti-dumping measures adopted five years  ago as they are regarded as very effective in having protected  European business interests.    In 1988, Chinese exports of paracetamol to the EC soared to  234 tons and the community rushed to impose a price limit of six  dollars a ton upon the drug at the end of that year.    As a result the figures declined sharply in 1992 to only 61  tons.    But the EC commission now believes that the European market  should be protected continually and has proposed maintaining the  imposition of anti-dumping tariffs upon the import of Chinese  paracetamol.    Analysts here believe the EC's anti-dumping measures are  designed to protect Europe's market, business and economy which  have been hit hard by the lingering recession.    But analysts warn that the community may have forgotten that  while restricting the sale of foreign goods, it has at the same  time built up a barrier against its own exports.    Meanwhile, the EC has been under fire from abroad for  repeatedly increasing subsidies which are intended to stimulate  its exports and spur an economic recovery in Europe.</p>

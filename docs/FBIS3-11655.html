Excavation has begun  where a new international terminal is to be built. The terminal  is to have a 600-passenger capacity, divided between incoming  and outgoing passengers. The airport will also have a fuel  storage facility adjacent to the new terminal.    This year the Ministry of Construction will spend over 4  million pesos on equipment, construction, and installations. Of  this total, it already possesses 10 percent in freely  convertible currency.    Engineer (Francisco Wilford), head of Cubana [de Aviacion's]  Assembly Department, explained that a brigade of experts from  the city of Havana, Camaguey, and Holguin is installing the  runway lights and the ILS instrument landing system, which will  provide greater safety for all airport operations.    When these projects are finished in the first half of 1995,  the Holguin airport, a National Vanguard airport for two  consecutive years, will be able to provide better service to  domestic and foreign travelers.    This year, airport officials intend to meet the airport's  self-financing plan by earning hard currency, as well as to  expand the work of ANIR [National Association of Innovators and  Efficiency Experts] and to make their technical and economic  plan a reality.</p>

The figure does not  include the overseas offices of Korean banks.    At the end of 1992, the number of overseas branches stood at  2,656, meaning the figure rose by 27.3 per month over the next  year. Based on these statistics, the current total is estimated  at more than 3,000. But out of the branch offices, only 494 are  actually conducting business and the remaining 2,490 are just  offices handling liaison affairs and research. Of the branch  offices, 1,495 are based in Asia, 694 in North America and 407  in Europe. By country, 659 are located in the United States, 624  in Japan, 192 in Hong Kong, 184 in China and 143 in Indonesia.    Last year 128 new offices were set up in China, reflecting  Korean companies' keen interest in that country. Vietnam and  Russia attracted 31 and 19, respectively.    By sector, manufacturing numbered 1,102, followed by trading  at 693: Transportation and fishing at 296: Tourism at 234 and  construction and services at 214.    Meanwhile, banks have 145 overseas offices, up 15 from 130  at  the end of 1992.

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Business Travel: The pick of the Parisian 'palaces' - Nicholas Haslam offers a guide to the benefits, and expense, of staying in the top hotels Parisians modestly call their best hotels 'palaces', but then argue furiously over which ones merit the title. Yet no one seems to doubt that the Plaza Athenee, the King George V, the Crillon and the Ritz are in line for first place. Sited in the exclusive central 1st and 8th arrondissements, and the briefest of limousine rides from La Defense business and commercial district, these hotels cater for those whose pockets - or expense accounts - are deep. Rooms at the Plaza start at FFr2,300 (Pounds 280), while a presidential suite costs FFr9,440. For this, however, you will receive some of the best service any hotel can offer, and join a guest list that reads like an international Who's Who. A few Metro stops from the Champs Elysees, the Grand Hotel Intercontinental looms beside the Opera in the heart of the Grand Boulevard district. With 514 rooms, the Grand is two stops from La Defense on the express rail RER, and has one of the largest conference rooms in the centre of Paris. Sixty per cent of guests are business people. A single room costs FFr1,600, but low-season reductions of up to 25 per cent are available. Do not count, however, on hanging on to your savings: partners waiting for spouses to return from interminable business meetings can go shopping at Galeries Lafayette across the road, where guests from the Grand get a 10 per cent discount. If you want to lunch outside the hotel, the area is full of excellent little restaurants. The Petit Gaillon in Rue Gaillon, just by the Opera, has excellent French and Senegalese food, and the Chartier at 7 Faubourg Montmartre offers reasonable food amid the decor of a 19th century brasserie. People say in Paris that if you work on the Right Bank, you play on the Left. For those not tied to full schedules at La Defense, many hotels on the Left Bank have a particular character and charm. The Lutetia on Boulevard Raspail has one of the best art deco facades in Paris. It is close to the Senate and the Sorbonne, and many guests are diplomats, politicians and academics. The hotel has 280 rooms and 12 conference rooms, the largest of which can hold up to 500 people. Rooms start from FFr950, while a two-bedroom apartment costs FFr6,000. The Brasserie Lutetia fronting the hotel is a well-known rendezvous. (While sipping a beer and watching the crowds go by, it is best not to think of the Lutetia's guests half a century ago, when the hotel served as Gestapo HQ.) Not far from the Lutetia, next to the Gallimard publishing house, is Hotel Montalembert. Reopened in 1991 after a year-long restoration, the hotel oozes Left Bank literary chic. An oak-panelled library opens off the main foyer, and the hotel numbers Carlos Fuentes and William Boyd among its guests. The 51 rooms and five suites are individually furnished in a mixture of traditional and modern French design, and start at FFr1,625. There are two conference rooms, the largest with a capacity for 25. At the back of the Montalembert, on Rue de l'Universite and Rue Jacob respectively, are two smaller hotels patronised by fashion buyers, journalists, artists and musicians. The Lenox has 30 designer-furnished rooms, and those on the top floor have views across lead-covered roof tops to the Louvre across the Seine. A double room costs FFr590 and a duplex apartment FFr960. La Villa, 100 metres down the road, has 32 rooms and a jazz club with an international reputation in the basement. The management stresses that the club is well insulated from the rooms above, which start at FFr800 (suites FFr1,950). Women business travellers alone in Paris should note that the Left Bank is one of the city's most secure areas, night and day. And non-French speakers should get a copy of Pariscope, a weekly magazine with a section in English that lists everything, from theatres to flea markets.

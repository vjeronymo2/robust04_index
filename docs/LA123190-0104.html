			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> FATAL ATTACK, OTHERS ASSUMED CONNECTED  </P> <P> Detectives investigating the death of a restaurant worker beaten as he walked  home Saturday morning say they continue to assume that he was a victim of men  wielding baseball bats who may have attacked three others in Orange and Santa  Ana in less than two hours.  </P> <P> "We're just assuming these could be related.  </P> <P> We don't have a witness or statements from the victim, but the similarities are  obvious," said Sgt. Jim Peery.  </P> <P> The victim of the first attack, which occurred at 11:45 p.m. Friday, was  identified as Alfredo Ernesto Rojas, 24, of Santa Ana. Rojas was walking with a  friend in the 200 block of East 17th Street when three men in a red, two-door  Chevrolet drove up and one got out, struck Rojas on the head with a bat and  stole his money, police said. Rojas described the men as black but a witness  described them as Latino.  </P> <P> Little more than an hour later, a 29-year-old man riding a bicycle on North  Tustin Street in Orange was struck with a baseball bat, kicked, beaten and  robbed. He could not describe the attackers or their numbers. His name was  withheld.  </P> <P> About 1:20 a.m. Saturday, Froylan Velasquez, 26, was found severely beaten near  the gate of his Tustin apartment complex and died later that morning. Police  said they have found no witnesses to the attack.  </P> <P> And at about 1:30 a.m. Rene Jimenez, 24, of Santa Ana was riding his bicycle in  the 800 block of North Bristol Street in Santa Ana when he was pulled off and  struck by baseball bats. He described his attackers as two black men. STEVE  EMMONS  </P></p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Observer: Cake walk After the hamburgers come the doughnuts. Following the advances of McDonald's and Burger King in Poland, Warsaw cake-maker Blikle is on the way to franchising its indigenously famous brand name nationwide. The expansion launched by company chief Andrzej Blikle, seconded by former Barclays de Zoete Wedd executive Piotr Pininski, crowns the company's 125 years of making and selling cakes in the centre of the capital. When the original shop was destroyed in the 1944 Warsaw uprising, the operation was moved next door and stayed open throughout communist rule. Five more shops are already in the offing. But the company boss - whose son, Lukasz, is also in the business - says that while following the hamburger outfits' commercial strategy, he's not going to endanger Blikle's quality reputation by also following them too far down market. Whether that amounts to trying to have his cake and eat it, only time will tell.</p>

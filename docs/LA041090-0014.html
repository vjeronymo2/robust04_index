			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: COOKING UP WAYS OF COPING WITH THE SWEET SMELLS OF EXCESS  </P> <P> I don't understand marketing experts. There's a new product on the grocery  shelves called "Aromatica" rice. It smells like popcorn when you cook it.  </P> <P> How much of a challenge can it be to make rice smell like something it isn't  when it doesn't have any smell to begin with? When they can make Brussels  sprouts smell like pizza or disguise sauerkraut so you don't pass out when you  open the can, give me a call.  </P> <P> I don't know where the idea came from, but I'll bet my last dollar it was  inspired by kids. Children are naturally suspicious of food served to them by  their mothers. There is dialogue about it before they even dip in their spoons.  Questions such as, "What do you call this stuff?" "Are you going to eat it?"  "What are those little bumps on the side?" Then they will sniff it and ask, "Is  it supposed to smell like this?"  </P> <P> I once passed out ice cream cones to my kids. They smelled them before they  took the first lick. When I asked them why they did that, they said, "Because  you are always trying to trick us."  </P> <P> Grow up, America. Our entire society is being tricked every day into making  things smell like something they aren't. Our bathrooms are sprayed to smell  like a forest of Christmas trees, our dishes smell like a lemon grove and our  cars are scented to smell like grape bubble gum. Our soap smells like peaches  and our shampoo like strawberries.  </P> <P> It's not that I'm opposed to making some foods smell better. It's just that  there are other foods that need help more. Take fish. Please. Every day, I wish  with all my heart that I loved fish. But I don't. If they could just remove the  heads from fish and give it a beef odor when it cooked and perhaps add a little  more fiber for consistency, they'd be onto something. I even have a name for  it: steak.  </P> <P> Most cheeses need work. I don't want to be in the same country as goat cheese.  It always tastes the way a yak looks in one of those National Geographic  specials.  </P> <P> Cooked cabbage has the strength of nuclear fallout. The odor travels 100 to 200  miles a day and is capable of making eyes water within a thousand-mile radius  of where someone removed a lid. It could smell better.  </P> <P> Somehow, the idea of renting a film and sharing a bowl of rice just doesn't do  it.  </P></p>

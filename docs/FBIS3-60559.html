			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  disease reports monitored in the FBIS Abidjan Bureau and EAU  coverage areas. Source information is given in parentheses after  each item.  <H5>  Burkina Faso </H5>   At a national blood transfusion seminar which ended  yesterday  in Ouagadougou, Jean Gabriel Ouango, the permanent secretary of  the National AIDS Control Committee, discussed the current  national AIDS situation. Ouango stated that between 7 and 8  percent of the population is seropositive, representing about  450,000 persons. He said that in Ouagadougou alone there are  about 5,000 persons testing seropositive, and added that very  soon an anonymous AIDS screening center would become  operational.

This was disclosed to parliament on 24  November while he was brieing the house on the spread of the  disease. He stated that, although the causative agent of the  disease is known, the exact mode of transmssion is not known.  He said that disease tracking efforts would be intensified to  minimize the number of cases.

He made  this remark in Abuja at the opening session of a two-day  workshop on the eradication of iodine deficiency disorder.  However, Mr. (Waki) said that Oyo, Ondo, Edo, Enugu, Benue,  Cross River, and Plateau states were still risking iodine  deficiency. He urged health workers and coordinators in the  program in those states to carry out the distribution of iodine  capsules effectively, so as to eliminate the dangers the disease  poses to the population. The Abuja workshop is aimed at  eradicating mental and physical deformities, as well as  disabilities that affect human beings due to a lack of iodine in  their bodies. (Lagos Radio Nigeria Network in English 1500 GMT  18 Nov 93)  <H5>  Rwanda </H5>   Jean-Baptiste Nubahumpatse reports that Burundian refugees  in  southern Rwanda and Bugesera still face untold suffering.  Dysentery rages, while food and the infrastructures needed to  meet their basic wants are lacking. Here is his report:  [Nubahumpatse] About 20 people die every day in the  Burundian refugee camps. That is at least what transpires from  testimonies from charitable relief organizations operating in  the region such as the Belgian Red Cross and French Medecins  Sans Frontieres who particularly deal with health problems. The  Burundian refugees are thus hard hit by dysentery, diarrhea,  measles, and other diseases. The grave overpopulation in the  camps, which has caused unbearable congestion, remains the  greatest handicap to the smooth running of relief operations.  The UNHCR, in cooperation with the Ministry of Works and Social  Affairs as well as local authorities, are currently at work to  try and solve the problem. In addition, particularly due to  this overpopulation in the camps, Burundian refugees rightly or  wrongly complain of a lack of adequate food rations. That is  the reason why some of them take risks by venturing across the  border to Burundi to try and get extra food. They are welcomed  by deadly bullets fired by permanently vigilant Burundian  soldiers, irrefutable proof of the continuing killings deep  inside Burundi. (Kigali Radiodiffusion Nationale de la  Republique Rwandaise in French 0430 GMT 19 Nov 93)  <H5>  Uganda </H5>   There has been an outbreak of dysentery in Kisoro District  in  which 12 people are recorded dead. Seven out of the 12 dead  died at Mutolere and Kisoro Hospitals while five died at their  homes. The scourge started in (Murora) sub-county and later  spread to some other parts and has now covered almost half the  district, the most hit areas being those along the Uganda-Rwanda  border. Other affected areas include (Ruaramba), (Chihe),  (Gisorora) and Muganza, being parishes which harbor the influx  of refugees fleeing the war. (Kampala Radio Uganda Network in  English 0400 GMT 24 Nov 93)  <H5>  Zaire </H5>   There has been an outbreak of dysentery at Lodja lately,  spreading to Lomela and other areas. About 80 deaths have been  reported. The worst-hit areas include Djinga and Gombela. The  government has appealed for urgent assistance from international  aid agencies (Kinshasa Tele-Zaire Television Network in French  1900 GMT 23 Nov 93)</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> a. Liquidation value will depend on the decreasing value of wasting assets, the costs experienced by the business being liquidated, the expenses borne by the Licensee in order to be able to realize any liquidating value, the elapsed time until such net proceeds can be realized, the ranking of the Licensee's claims relative to other security interests and subordination agreements, and the probability of any ultimate realization of value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Incorporating this approach as a normal step in valuation can provide improved understanding of the downside of an investment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Licensees should recognize unrealized appreciation or depreciation, as appropriate, on Assets Acquired in Liquidation of Loans and Investments. In order to recognize Unrealized Appreciation, asset values must be verified by an appraisal which meets all the conditions specified in the preceding paragraph;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Provided, however, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  that if the assets acquired constitute a going concern, such assets may be appraised as a going concern rather than at liquidation value. Unrealized Appreciation may not be recognized if the Licensee does not benefit from such appreciation. For example, an asset acquired through foreclosure should not be carried at a value greater than the defaulted loan balance plus any expenses and penalties to which the Licensee is entitled. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Warrants should be valued at the excess of the value of the underlying security over the exercise price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Valuation of debt with detachable warrants can be done similarly to convertible debt by treating the debt and warrants as a unit, or, alternatively, the debt can be valued on its own basis as a debt instrument, and the warrants separately. If the warrants are valued separately, the following factors must be taken into account: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Current value of issued shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The differential between the exercise private and the underlying share values if the current share values are higher than the exercise price. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Time until expiration dates are reached or dates of changes in terms of exercise prices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Number of shares into which the warrants are exercisable on various dates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Restrictions on sale of the underlying stock. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Restrictions on the transferability of the warrants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Registration rights for the warrants or the underlying shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Financial ability of the Licensee to perform the exercise of its rights or to sell its warrants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) The ultimate desirability, if any, of exercising the rights given by the warrants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> D. Equity Securities_Public Companies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Public securities should be valued as follows: (a) For over-the-counter stocks, take the average of the bid price at the close for the valuation date and the preceding two days, and (b) for listed stocks, take the average of the close for the valuation date and the preceding two days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. However, securities are not deemed to be freely marketable in those situations where such securities are very thinly or infrequently traded, or may be lacking in truly representative market quotations, or where the market for such securities cannot absorb the quantity of shares which the Licensee and similar investors may want to sell. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. In such cases, Asset Value must be determined by the Board of Directors or General Partners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The valuation of public securities that are restricted should be discounted appropriately until the securities may be freely traded. Such discounts typically range from 10% to 40%, but the discounts can be more or less, depending upon the resale restrictions under securities laws or contractual agreements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. When the number of shares held is substantial in relation to the average daily trading volume, the valuation should be discounted by at least 10%, and generally by more. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 19, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Erskine B.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report "from foreign and Russian press materials": "Gold </F> Extraction Is Increasing"]    [Text] According to information from officials of the  Russian Federation Committee on Precious Metals and Precious  Stones, gold production in Russia in 1993 increased by 3.4  metric tons over 1992, reaching 149.5 metric tons; of this  amount, 136.2 metric tons were extracted at gold-bearing  deposits, 8.3 metric tons were derived as a by-product in the  processing of nonferrous ores, and 5 metric tons were obtained  from recycled raw materials. In 1994, it is planned to increase  gold production in the country by 3 to 4 percent over 1993.    In the opinion of the committee's managers, the adoption of  a  number of economic and organizational measures has contributed  to relative stabilization in the sector. For example, the rights  of the administration in regions have been extended to the  issuance of licenses to extract precious metals and stones and  the attraction of foreign capital in developing the deposits and  selling the metals produced. The introduction of world prices in  1992 to pay for the gold extracted was important as well.    The Russian Ministry of Finance has announced plans to  introduce a new system this year for gold purchases in the  country, in accordance with which producers will sell half of  the metal they turn out in the domestic market. Under the new  arrangement, the state will buy 50 percent of the gold produced  in the country, 20 to 30 percent of this through the Central  Bank and commercial banks which have licenses to conduct  transactions in precious metals. Producers will sell the  remaining metal in order to reinvest the funds received in  production development.    A competition has been announced for the right to develop  the  Asachinsk and Rodniki deposits where reserves of the metal is  estimated at 70 metric tons and the ore here has a high gold  content--20 grams per metric ton. Interest in the competition  has been expressed by several foreign and joint venture firms,  including "Caminco Venture Gold" and "New Grest Mining." An  application has also been made by the "Russian Gold Mining  Corporation." It is expected that results of the competition  will be reported in June.    The American company Morrison-Knudsen Corp. ("MK") should  begin extracting gold in Kyrgyzstan in 1995 at an enterprise in  which $100 million is being invested. Under the agreement  concluded with the country's government, the wholly-owned  subsidiary firm "MK Gold" will develop the Dzheruy gold deposit  jointly with the Kyrgyz state company "Kyrgyzaltyn." Reserves at  the deposit, which can be worked by the open method, are  estimated at roughly 80 metric tons of gold, extracted from ore  with a gold content of 6 grams per metric ton.    The new enterprise is expected to turn out over 4.5 metric  tons of gold annually. Under the agreement, "MK Gold" will  receive 30 percent of the profit from operating the mine and the  country's government will receive 70 percent. The "Kyrgyzaltyn"  company will acquire the right to sell the gold in the domestic  market and in other countries.    Tajikistan, through the "Tajik Gold" firm, concluded an  agreement a year ago with the "Gulf International Minerals"  company for technical assistance in reequipping the existing  "Kansay" enterprise. In the near future, the Canadian "Gulf  International" company expects to receive results of the gold  concentrates shipped to Japan from this mine.    Work is now under way at the Tajik mine mentioned to  increase  gold output, and in addition, a survey of other gold deposits in  the country has been completed. The joint venture company has  concluded an agreement with the Tajikistan Government to process  tailings from the Darvas region. Under the agreement, "Gulf"  will pay the expenses for fuel, install new equipment, and  provide technical supervision, while the government will provide  the mine with manpower, available equipment, and electricity.    According to official data, about 22 metric tons of gold  have  been produced in the Darvas region, where the largest alluvial  deposit of gold in Tajikistan is located. According to the  "Gulf" company's estimate, there are about 5 metric tons of gold  in the tailings from this deposit, with a gold content of 2  grams per cubic meter. The company has also surveyed the primary  reserves of placer gold at this deposit, which are estimated at  18 metric tons, with a gold content of 0.95 frams per cubic  meter. "Gulf" has preference for further joint activity with  "Tajik Gold" in developing these reserves.    As reported by EKOTASS, the European Bank for Reconstruction  and Development will grant a loan to Uzbekistan to complete  construction of a gold mining complex being carried out by the  Uzbek-American joint venture "Zarafshan-Newmont." The projected  cost of the operation is estmated at $150 million. The new  enterprise plans to extract gold from tailings at the Muruntau  deposit, the world's largest gold deposit where the gold can be  extracted by the open method.    In Kazakhstan, the "Zoloto Kazakhstana" program, aimed at  increasing the country's gold production, has been drafted and  is now under way. It is assumed that by 1997, Kazakhstan may  become one of the world's 10 largest gold-producing countries.    According to a report from the INTERFAX agency, Georgia  plans  to extract 1.5 metric tons of gold in 1994 and to increase its  production of this metal to 4 metric tons in 1997. Georgia  produced 1.9 metric tons in 1991, but the economic crisis in the  country led to a decrease in the country's gold output. It is  estimated that 1 metric ton was turned out in 1993.    The company "Hol-Lac Gold Mines," headquartered in Toronto,  has concluded an agrement with the Ukrainian state company  "Geoprognoz" for geological exploration operations to locate  precious metals (as well as the basic nonferrous metals and  diamonds) in Ukraine. "Hol-Lac Gold Mines" will will finance the  operation over a 5-year period. "Geoprognoz" will provide  assistance in obtaining authorization for prospecting and will  provide a group of geologists to search for the minerals.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises as higher yen prompts interest rate hopes THE SURGE in the yen to a record high against the dollar raised hopes of lower interest rates, and shares advanced on active buying by investment trusts and dealers, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average gained 327.23 at 18,609.95, having opened at the day's low of 18,325.64 and reaching a high of 18,701.95 in the afternoon. Volume increased to 370m shares from 288m, although institutional investors said they were in no hurry to trade in large lots. Rises outnumbered falls by 703 to 303, with 139 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 15.02 to 1,381.18, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.90 to 1,107.23. The yen appreciated to Y119.83 against the dollar in the morning session as the currency turmoil in Europe prompted Japanese investors to liquidate European currency holdings. It closed at Y120.25 on position adjustments. Hopes of an imminent discount rate cut by the Bank of Japan also sparked a rally on the government bond market, where the yield on the No 145 10-year benchmark bond fell 11 basis points to 4.79 per cent. Potential beneficiaries of a higher yen and lower interest rates rallied, while exporters lost ground. Steels and shipbuilders were higher. Among leading exporters, Hitachi lost Y13 to Y759 and Matsushita Electric Industrial Y60 to Y1,140. Toyota Motor receded Y20 to Y1,420 and Honda Motor fell Y80 to Y1,320. A firm resource-related sector had Nippon Oil Y30 ahead at Y690 and Showa Shell Sekiyu up Y60 at Y1,370. Electric power companies gained ground, Tokyo Electric Power appreciating Y80 to Y2,800. Individuals and dealers continued to trade speculative stocks. Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting, the most active issue of the day, climbed Y60 to Y523, reflecting reports of a gold mine discovery in southern Japan. Sumitomo Metal Mining moved ahead Y22 to Y764. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 218.21 to 19,822.90 in volume of 40m shares. Roundup THE region's markets were mixed yesterday. BANGKOK saw some profit-taking following a sharp rally over the past week as investors reacted positively to the formation of the new government. The SET index shed 7.76 to 863.61, while turnover soared to Bt20.5bn, only the second day that daily turnover has exceeded Bt20bn. Bangkok Land and Krisda Mahanakorn retreated Bt4 and Bt14 respectively to Bt146 and Bt230. AUSTRALIA recovered from early falls to end the day slightly higher on heavy Japanese buying of futures contracts. After declining 10 points initially, the All Ordinaries index closed a net 2.2 up at 1,507.2. Turnover was ADollars 212m. Westpac slipped 9 cents to ADollars 2.91 after announcing that its ADollars 1.2bn rights issue had closed with a 72 per cent shortfall. News Corp was up 22 cents at ADollars 24.20 following a forecast of record earnings for 1992/93. HONG KONG saw overseas selling as uncertainty about the future of the Colony's new airport soured sentiment. The Hang Seng index regained some ground in late trading to finish 53.91 down at 5,658.73, having earlier registered a 90-point fall. Turnover expanded to HKDollars 1.96bn from Wednesday's HKDollars 1.65bn. MANILA saw dull trading and the composite index eased 1.13 to 1,386.42. Turnover jumped to 307.2m pesos from the previous day's 184m pesos. SEOUL's early gains were eroded as political worries persisted.

BOMBAY fell sharply on fears that today's meeting between brokers and officials of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) could lead to a confrontation. The BSE index closed 51.79 lower at 3,246.96. Bourse chiefs are expected to oppose SEBI moves, which include changing the composition of exchange boards to a 60 per cent portion of outside nominees and reducing settlement periods.</p>

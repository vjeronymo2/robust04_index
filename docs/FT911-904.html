			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Paraguay finds old habits die hard: Breaking with the past is not always easy NO ONE knows where they have gone but somewhere in this land-locked South American backwater must lie the many Alfredo Stroessner statues, nameplates and slogans that once graced every Paraguay street corner and prominent building. Little more than two years after the western hemisphere's longest-serving dictator was deposed, the country has been stripped of all physical traces of his rule. But some things have not changed. In the main street of the otherwise sleepy capital of Asuncion, Stroessner's legacy lives on in the form of hundreds of hawkers crying: 'Eh senorita, wanna buy Rolex?' Roadside tables piled high with fake watches, smuggled French perfumes and Japanese electronics are evidence that the contraband culture which Stroessner encouraged is alive and kicking. The new government of General Andres Rodriguez is publicly committed to stamping out the business, which nets more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 588m) a year. It began promisingly in February 1989 by introducing a unified floating exchange rate which substantially increased official exports that year. But official exports have again dropped back and critics claim that, like his predecessor, Gen Rodriguez is not only turning a blind eye to contraband but is using it to lubricate his political machine. One official said the government feared the social consequences of ending contraband; a recent study found that banning cigarette smuggling would deprive 20,000 people of a source of income. The commerce minister insists on describing as 'regional trade' the ill-gotten gains which fuel the capital's neon-lit casinos and explain the Mercedes in its streets and elaborate mansions on its outskirts. 'We're like a little Hong Kong' says Mr Antonio Zuccolillo as he explains that Paraguay's 'under the table trade' with its biggest trading partner, Brazil, is double that conducted above board. No one expected that 35 years of dictatorship could be erased overnight. But some complain that only the names have changed and that the system continues. However, the human rights situation has improved immeasurably and ABC Color, the country's most popular and outspoken newspaper, is currently publishing a series of articles denouncing corruption in the present government with no fear of being closed down, as it was in 1984 until Stroessner's fall. In fact political change has come more quickly than expected, given that Paraguay had no popular revolution but a military coup and that Gen Rodriguez is an old friend and relation - by marriage - of Stroessner, who now lives in exile in Brazil. Although Gen Rodriguez simply took over Stroessner's Colorado party and sanctified his position by an election marred by allegations of fraud, he seems determined to uphold his promise of a transition to democracy by 1993. May will see Paraguay's first free municipal elections, to be followed by national elections in two years. On the economic side, the guarani continues as one of Latin America's strongest currencies and the economy has not collapsed as predicted after funds dried up from the massive Itaipu hydro-electric project. The scheme, financed principally by Brazil, meant annual growth rates of 10 per cent in the early 1980s. Although last year Paraguay had zero growth - partly because of Brazil's failure to pay bills for imported electricity - and 45 per cent inflation, its highest ever, its problems pale in comparison to those of its two giant neighbours, Argentina and Brazil. However, the government has shied away from its promised privatisation programme and much-needed land reform. According to Mr Tomas Palau, a social scientist, only 5 per cent of the land is cultivated and most of Paraguay's rural population are landless squatters who survive by subsistence farming. 'Contraband has destroyed our rural economy', says Mr Palau, pointing out that the shops are filled with Brazilian produce and that Paraguay imports 60 per cent of its basic food. This is not through a shortage of fertile land. Paraguay has 400,000 sq km for its population of 4m and has often been described as an agricultural arcadia. In fact the east has been taken over by an estimated 200,000 Brazilians who find the land across the border more attractive. But contraband has meant little revenue reaching the Treasury for agricultural development. What may force this to change is the recent creation of a common market with Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. This is intended to end all tariffs between the countries by 1995. It would also set up common external tariffs, which would end Paraguay's function as a duty free store, forcing it to find an alternative source of income. Joining that market is part of Paraguay's process of cleaning up its image. New incentives have attracted Dollars 400m in foreign investment over the last 18 months, and last October it signed a letter of intent with the IMF for an 18-month standby facility - its first programme with the fund for more than 30 years.</p>

			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEBOW ASKS PRIME TO PROVE ITS WORTH  </P> <P> Bennett S. LeBow, who has pursued Prime Computer with a $970-million hostile  takeover bid, Thursday challenged the Natick, Mass., company to prove it is  worth more and repeated that he might negotiate a higher bid.  </P> <P> LeBow, chairman of Tustin-based MAI Basic Four, said his company would  "seriously consider" raising the cash offer if it got information from Prime  "that demonstrates that such an increase is warranted."  </P> <P> The new overture from LeBow was contained in a letter to Prime executives dated  Wednesday that offered a confidentiality agreement in return for information  about Prime. LeBow released the letter Thursday.  </P> <P> Prime declined to comment on the letter.  </P> <P> The stock market apparently shrugged off LeBow's latest statement. Prime stock  gained 25 cents to close $18.625 a share in trading Thursday. MAI's buyout  offer amounts to $20 a share.  </P> <P> John Adams, an analyst for Adams Harness &amp; Hill in Boston, said LeBow's  offer to go higher had a "Catch-22" in that Prime has all along resisted the  deal.  </P></p>

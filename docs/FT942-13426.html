			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / UK Company News: VCI hopes for Pounds 60m tag - Three more companies planning a quotation on London market VCI, one of the UK's largest independent publishers of videos and pre-recorded music, is planning to float on the Stock Exchange within the next few months in a move that could value the company at about Pounds 60m. VCI, formed in a management buy-out from Prestwich Holdings in 1989, has rights to more than 1,000 titles in both video and music - titles that include Thomas The Tank Engine, Sooty and Mr Bean. The company wants to raise Pounds 30m, via a placing and intermediaries offer, to pay off Pounds 25m in debt remaining from the management buy-out and provide funds for expansion and acquisition of further rights. The company is run by Mr Steve Ayres who pioneered the budget video 'sell-through' business in the UK - selling videos rather than renting videos. The sell-through market overtook the stagnant rental market in 1992 and has been showing steady growth. The British market was worth Pounds 643m (Pounds 506m) at the retail level in 1993, although the performance was helped by the release of two strong Disney titles - The Jungle Book and Beauty and the Beast. VCI was fifth in the video retail marketplace after Buena Vista (Disney), Polygram, BBC and Warner Home Video. In 1993 VCI reported record operating profits on continuing operations of Pounds 5.9m on turnover of Pounds 59.8m. "We think the video business has prospects for very good growth - something of a bonanza,' says Mr Ayres, who emphasises that as owners of rights, VCI can move to exploit a whole range of emerging technology. In June, for example, the company will launch its first range of personal computer software and has bought rights to 300 titles ranging from games to education. The company will also launch 20 titles on video CD later this year, partly at least to stimulate this market. VCI's music company, Music Collection International, was launched in 1990 and has a 0.9 per cent share of a market worth Pounds 786m a year at trade prices.</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEST COVINA PLAZA DEBUTS ITS NEW LOOK  </P> <P> The first fruits of a $120-million renovation and expansion of the Plaza at  West Covina were unveiled last week in what city and business officials hope  will be the dawning of a new era for the shopping center.  </P> <P> The two-part project involves a redesign of the plaza's interior and the  eventual addition of 40 stores to the facility, said Michael Shulman, a  managing partner of the plaza.  </P> <P> Shulman said a May Co. department store will be the largest of the new  businesses. May Centers Inc. of St. Louis bought a 15% partnership in the plaza  in 1988.  </P> <P> The first phase, a $40-million renovation, was begun in December and was  completed this month, General Manager Gregory S. Beyer said.  </P> <P> Beyer said the work, which included the installation of new carpeting,  lighting, landscaping and the addition of 10 fast-food outlets, was done to  keep the plaza competitive with other shopping centers.  </P> <P> "It's a brand new shopping center, for all intents and purposes," Beyer said.  </P> <P> Construction of a new wing to house 40 additional stores will begin in January,  Beyer said, and should be open by fall of 1992.  </P> <P> West Covina City Manager Robert Fast said the renovation and expansion of the  shopping center should help boost the city's income.  </P> <P> The plaza currently generates about 15% of West Covina's sales tax revenues, or  $1.2 million, Fast said. The city hopes to be taking in close to $2 million a  year after the expansion is complete.  </P> <P> The plaza has 150 businesses, including JC Penney, The Broadway and Bullock's  department stores, and takes in about $120 million annually, Beyer said.  </P></p>

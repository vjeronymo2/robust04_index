			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] Indonesia threw a blanket of secrecy over a planned  meeting between visiting ROC [Republic of China] President Li  Teng-hui and Indonesian President Suharto on the resort island  of Bali on Friday [11 February].    Officials in Jakarta, who are being tight-lipped ever since  Li arrived in Bali on Wednesday on a three-country trip that has  raised the ire of Mainland China, declined to give details, but  said they expected that the two leaders had already met in  Taipei.    Meanwhile, Taiwan Television Enterprise, or TTV, confirmed  Friday night that Li after having met Friday [as received]  before Suharto flew back to Jakarta in the late afternoon.  Although no video or still pictures of Li and Suharto together  were featured on the television newscast, the vehicles used by  both Li and Suharto were shown arriving at the Bali meeting site.    According to TTV, Suharto reportedly expressed his  admiration  for impressive achievements of Taiwan small and medium  enterprises. Meanwhile, Li reportedly said the ROC wanted to  boost its role as a partner in international and regional  economic groupings, as well as work to help insure the  maintenance of peace in the region.    In Indonesia, the official ANTARA news agency said: Suharto,  accompanied by State Secretary Murdiono and Tourism and  Telecommunications Minister Joop Ave, was to visit Bali on  Friday to see the Grand Bali Beach Hotel, which was devastated  by fire one year ago.    Official sources said: Foreign Minister Ali Alatas had also  traveled to Bali on Friday. Suharto's movements were off limit  to all journalists.    President Li's tour of Southeast Asia, billed as a private  trip, has angered Mainland China, which regards Taiwan as a  renegade province. Beijing warned the Philippines, Indonesia,  and Thailand their relations with Mainland China could be  damaged if they allowed Li's trip to proceed.    Indonesia, current chairman of the Nonaligned Movement and  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, has formal diplomatic  ties with Beijing. Foreign Minister Alatas has said a private  visit by Li will not change Jakarta's one-China policy. Quote,  Li Teng-hui's visit to Bali is only an informal one. He is on  vacation in Bali. There is no deviation from Indonesia's stand  of having only trade relations with Taiwan, unquote.    In the aftermath of ROC President Li Teng-hui's lunch with  Philippine President Fidel Ramos this week, Mainland China said  the meeting sabotaged friendly relations between Beijing and  Manila. But Ramos immediately countered that he had not violated  Manila's one-China policy. Beijing's embassy in Manila said it  will lodge a formal protest over Wednesday's luncheon meeting  between Li and Ramos. A copy of the embassy's statement was  sent to the Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday.  In the statement, the embassy accused Taiwan of pursuing a  southward policy aimed at developing substantive relations with  some nations and creating a two-China situation. Beijing  officially regards Taiwan as a renegade province.    Before Li flew into Subic Bay, northwest of Manila, on the  first leg of a three-nation private trip, Beijing told the  Philippines the visit would harm relations.    The Ramos government tried to throw a veil of secrecy over  the meeting. Once news leaked out, Ramos acknowledged that it  took place, but said it did not violate Manila's one-China  policy under which the Philippines officially recognizes  Mainland China.    In a live interview on Philippine television Thursday night,  Ramos said he and Li had not talked about political matters.  Ramos said they only discussed trade and economic cooperation  which is allowed under the one-China policy. Under the term of  its one-China policy, the Philippine Government officially  recognizes Beijing as the sole legitimate government of China,  of which Taiwan is an integral part. Ramos said that Taiwan is  today the biggest investor in Subic Bay. Taiwan-based  enterprises are investing in a 300 hectre industrial estate  which will be the site of 150 factories which is scheduled to be  inaugurated on 20 February. Ramos added that Taiwan has  arranged for soft loans amounting to $23 million for the  development of Subic Bay. This could be expanded to $100  million in the next couple of years depending on the need, he  added. Ramos also said that he and Li discussed joint ventures  in agriculture-based businesses. Li reportedly told Ramos that  he would like to see the Philippines supply Taiwan's sugar  reguirements since sugar production on the island has dropped  significantly due to land use changes. Ramos hosted a luncheon  meeting at the Admiral's House in Subic for Li and his entourage  of 60 businessmen and officials, including Foreign Minister  Federick Chien and Council for Economic and Planning Development  Chairman Vincent Hsiao.    Philippine officials said Beijing's reaction was largely  what  had already been expected. They said the Phillipines has to  balance its desire for good relations with Beijing against its  urgent need for investment from Taiwan.</p>

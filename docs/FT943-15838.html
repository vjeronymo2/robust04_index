			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Leader for the WTO When almost 120 governments signed the Uruguay Round in April, they hailed it as the most sweeping reform of the world trade system since the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was established 47 years ago. But the gains promised by the round will be realised only if the impetus needed to agree on the grand design is now applied with as much determination to its execution. Critical to the success of the endeavour will be the choice of a leader for the World Trade Organisation, which is due to succeed the Gatt early next year. The WTO will have a formal institutional structure, clearer procedures and stronger dispute settlement mechanisms. It will also enjoy a far wider remit, embracing such issues as trade in services and intellectual property rights. However, the organisation's enhanced profile will be more than matched by increased responsibilities. The most pressing is to implement the Uruguay Round. As well as holding governments to their commitments to open trade in heavily protected sectors such as agriculture and textiles, that will involve developing a multilateral regulatory framework for areas such as services and direct investment. In tackling many of these questions, the WTO will inevitably find itself encroaching on domestic policies, long regarded by governments as their sovereign preserve. The potential for political frictions is clear. It will almost certainly be heightened if the organisation yields to demands that it plunge into contentious issues, such as the links between trade and labour standards and environment policy. Challenges ahead These challenges must be addressed against a background of rapid change in the world economic order. Many developing countries have overcome former suspicions of the free market to embrace liberalisation. Meanwhile, industrialised powers have grown defensive and equivocal in their commitment to the multilateral trade system, of which they were once the main proponents. The system's integrity is further threatened by the risk of financial instability posed by capital flows and by the formation of regional economic blocs, which may try to manipulate multilateral rules to their advantage. Much of the onus for charting a course through these turbulent cross-currents will fall on the WTO and its head. What should be the latter's priorities - and personal qualities? Obviously, the organisation needs to be efficient and well-run. However, its head need not become deeply immersed in its administrative and technical affairs, many of which can safely be delegated. Nor should the boss be closely involved with the WTO's disputes mechanisms, which will be judged largely on their impartiality and independence. Coherent leadership By far the biggest task will be to give coherent direction and leadership to world trade policy. That calls, first, for clear strategic vision and an ability to set firm long-term objectives for enhancing global economic welfare. Second, it requires the personal authority to persuade governments that it is in their collective interest to put these goals above the narrow pursuit of national advantage. The third prerequisite is political skills, combining sensitivity to the differing domestic pressures on WTO members with a flair for forging common ground between them. The WTO leader must also command wide international confidence. For any powerful member to try to impose a candidate would undermine that goal. Above all, Europe, which has provided every Gatt director-general, should not assume it has a special claim on the WTO post. Nor does Europe's current introspection commend it as a recruiting ground. Of the candidates declared so far, President Carlos Salinas of Mexico appears to match up most closely to the requirements of the job. However, he has still to say how he would tackle it, while others may yet enter the race. If the WTO is to get the leadership it needs, it is important that the choice of contenders be as wide as possible. They should also be encouraged to state clearly the agenda they would follow and how they propose to put it into effect.</p>

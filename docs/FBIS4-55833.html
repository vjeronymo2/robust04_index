			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yuri Matochkin, head of the administration </F> of Kaliningrad Oblast, by Wieslaw S. Debski; place and date not  given: "Kaliningrad--A Special Town"]    [Text] [Debski] Cooperation between Kaliningrad Oblast  and Polish voivodships located near the border is most commonly  associated with two "roundtables" and several seminars  concerning this topic. However, are there any concrete results  of those discussions?    [Matochkin] We believe that "roundtables" are a good  organizational form of keeping up cooperation in our region.  They were necessary at the beginning of our cooperation--they  created conditions for its foundation. The most important  matter is the fact that both entrepreneurs and politicians have  already been participating in talks at those tables; they have  shared the necessary information with each other.    [Debski] More specifically, could you tell us how many joint  Polish-Russian companies there are in the oblast and what the  size of Polish investment there is?    [Matochkin] Twenty-eight percent of the trade is with  Poland. We have 742 joint-venture companies; the largest portion  of them, 275, are joint-venture firms with Polish companies.    You are also in a good position as far as investment is  concerned; you occupy the second position, close behind the  Germans, whose financial possibilities are certainly much  greater, and we understand this. For us, Poland is attractive  not so much for the size of its investment but because it has  people who are energetic and entrepreneurial. It is they who  are establishing companies in the oblast and conducting trade.    [Debski] Kaliningrad Oblast has been announced as a special  economic zone. What does this mean to foreign businessmen?    [Matochkin] By virtue of the decision by the president and  the government, the oblast has obtained a number of allowances:    --Tariff concessions--all merchandise coming to us is exempt  from the import customs duty, and merchandise manufactured in  the oblast is exempt from the export customs duty.    --Tax allowances--foreign companies or companies with mixed  capital are exempt from taxes entirely or partially, for a  specified period. The size of the allowances and the time of  their being in force is found on a special scale that depends on  the type of production.    [Debski] According to businessmen, however, not all of these  allowances can be found in practice.    [Matochkin] I can say that tariff concessions are, in fact,  already in force. Indeed, the tax system is not functioning as  it should yet, also because there are still only a few companies  that meet all of the conditions. For example, if a company  wants to get a 50-percent reduction of its income tax, it must  export 50 percent of its products.    We are now dealing with this problem--we are analyzing what  results the allowances and reductions do or do not yield.    We are also analyzing the functioning of tariff concessions  and their influence on the level of our prices. It turns out  that the tariff concession for food, where the tariff to be paid  is approximately 30 percent, decreases the price of food  commodities by 10-15 percent. Thus, reductions are more  beneficial to businessmen than to the inhabitants of the oblast.  We understand, of course, that the profit rate must be higher  here than in other regions of the Russian Federation; however, I  do not think the proportions between the profit and the  reduction of prices are correct.    All things considered, I can say that the special zone is  functioning and yielding results, even though they are still not  the results we would like to see. This is understandable. We  have not been working in this system long. The most recent  allowances and reductions came into effect in February 1994 and  the first ones in late 1992. What is needed, then, is patience,  all the more so because we want to further develop the concept  of this zone.    [Debski] People in Poland are deeply concerned about the  accumulation of troops in the oblast. Some say that there are  as many as 200,000 of them. Why so many?    [Matochkin] I could ask those who say such things to prove  that there are really 200,000.    [Debski] How many soldiers are there really, then?    [Matochkin] If we were to count the soldiers and the  officers along with their families, then, if we assumed that  each of the families consisted of three persons, we would  estimate the figure at 200,000.    [Debski] Along with the families?    [Matochkin] Yes. Along with the families.    [Debski] However, you yourself said once that the military  people constitute 10 percent of the oblast's population, which  is 920,000 people.    [Matochkin] That was the case when I said this, a year and  a half or two years ago. Since that time, we have been  witnessing the process of limiting the armed forces. Standing  units are being liquidated, such as the 24th Brigade of Rocket  Cutters that has arrived here from Poland. Other units are  being reduced in size--for example, divisions are being  transformed into brigades. Moreover, each of the type of troops,  apart from the border-protecting units, has too few soldiers.  Simply, there are not enough draftees.    Russian Defense Minister Pawel Gratchev has announced that  we  are planning, or, more specifically, that we are discussing, the  idea of establishing the so-called Kaliningrad defense region.  It is supposed to save money through the liquidation of  parallel services. Today both the Baltic Fleet and the 11th Army  have their own units of material supply, for instance, even  though it would be cheaper if they were joint. This will lead  to a further reduction in the number of troops.    [Debski] Is there a program for these reductions?    [Matochkin] Yes, there is.    [Debski] For how long is it scheduled?    [Matochkin] Until the year 2000 for the time being. The  fact that your authorities keep repeating the figure 200,000  only proves how poorly your intelligence services are working.  After all, it is not all that difficult to count soldiers.    The Russian Federation does not have the possibilities to  develop its armed forces; it has no money for that. It can only  maintain them on a level that is necessary for our defense.    I believe that the issue of the size of our armed forces is  a  political card that is being played on purpose. There have been  proposals recently, such as the one by Algirdas Brazauskas that  a demilitarized zone be set up here. But why? What are the  arguments for this? Does the oblast threaten anybody?    [Debski] Apparently such are the feelings...    [Matochkin] If so, there must be further logic. If we  demilitarize the oblast, will Lithuania and Poland be  demilitarized as well? Otherwise, we will feel threatened.    [Debski] This is a fundamental problem in our relations as  the Polish president sees it. Now, what problems can you see?    [Matochkin] There are no serious problems. We should try to  cooperate more effectively, more openly; this cooperation should  be more advantageous to both sides. I consider our relations to  be normal. Cooperation with our Polish partners is very good.    There is only one matter we want to complain about. We have  started building the Kaliningrad-Elblag highway, which,  incidentally, was a Polish initiative. We will complete our  portion this year; we will reach the border. And what next?  When will the Poles complete the rest?    [Debski] So the issue of the Vistula Lagoon navigation is  not a problem for you?    [Matochkin] It certainly is. But, all right, let us discuss  problems if you want to. I believe that controversial issues  should be resolved, such as the issue of the Vistula Lagoon or  the highway. Who most wants to see the issue of the Visula  Lagoon navigation resolved? You do. And who wants to see the  construction of the highway completed? We do. Let us, then,  help each other on both issues. Otherwise, it looks like we are  relenting on the issue of the Vistula Lagoon, but you are not  budging on the issue of the highway.    We can see three controversial issues:    a) The Kaliningrad-Elblag highway: What is needed is a clear  answer to whether the Poles want to build it. If you have no  money for it, we will look for some together. For example, we  can visit the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development  together and try to get the money there.    b) The Goldap-Gusiew border-crossing site: I want to know  what our side will get out of it and what you will get. Poles  know that this border crossing will increase traffic near the  border. We want it to be the second variant of the road to  Grodno--not through Lithuania.    c) The Vistula Lagoon: Right now, the situation at the  lagoon  is satisfactory as far as we are concerned. I understand, of  course, that Poles have a differing opinion.    What we should do, then, is sit down and discuss all of  these  problems at the same time. In one issue we will make a  concession, in another you will. On all of these issues, the  time for discussions has ended: Specific problems must be  resolved now.    Postscript: When we were saying goodbye to each other, Yuri  Matochkin said: If President Lech Walesa does not believe the  figures we submit, he might come and visit us. I am inviting  him. We will show him all of the places, all of the units he  wants to see. He may see for himself that 200,000 soldiers are  not there.</p>

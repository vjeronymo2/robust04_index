			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> IN CHARGE: TOLLIVER?, MCMAHON?;  </P> <P> CHARGERS: THE PLOT THICKENS IN ANOTHER EPISODE OF, "AS THE QUARTERBACK TURNS."  WHO WILL START AGAINST THE EAGLES.?  </P> <P> The question of whether to start Charger rookie Billy Joe Tolliver or veteran  Jim McMahon at quarterback against the Eagles Sunday turned into a full-blown  controversy Monday when Tolliver appeared unsure, Coach Dan Henning said he was  undecided and McMahon was downright snotty.  </P> <P> Asked if he had any thoughts about Sunday's 10-7 loss at Seattle and his  uncertain status as the team's starting quarterback, McMahon said, "I have  none."  </P> <P> Asked if he thought he would play against the Eagles after watching Tolliver  take his place in the starting lineup against the Seahawks, McMahon said, "I  don't know."  </P> <P> Asked to talk about the problems McMahon and the Chargers had utilizing the  clock on their final futile possession at Seattle, McMahon grew completely  silent. Then he walked past his questioner, pressed one nostril closed with his  finger and blew out of the other. "There's an answer for you," he said.  </P> <P> McMahon completed nine of 12 for 82 yards and one touchdown after coming off  the bench against the Seahawks in the fourth quarter. Tolliver completed just  six of 17 passes for 41 yards and never got the offense past midfield.  </P> <P> "Maybe I thought I was better than I actually was," Tolliver said politely and  patiently. Tolliver said he didn't expect to find out until Wednesday who next  Sunday's starter would be.  </P> <P> Henning, whose Chargers have staggered to the halfway point of the season with  a four-game losing streak, said he would probably decide today.  </P> <P> "We're a little bit torn," Henning said. "Billy didn't play as well as we  thought he would Sunday. But he didn't have much help. Jim gives us the best  opportunity to win at this point in time. But we have to get Billy ready to  play at some point in time."  </P> <P> It was hard to tell which way Henning was leaning. But it was clear the  decision will send a message on whether Henning considers the rest of the  season to be a rehearsal for 1990 or an attempt to salvage a respectable record  this year.  </P> <P> Henning also said he was considering wholesale changes on offense, where  injuries, new personnel and the complexities of the Henning system have slowed  the team's progress.  </P> <P> Henning wouldn't specify the changes and said they could be made as late as  Saturday. He did say he learned a lot about Tolliver, even in defeat.  </P> <P> "I found this out," Henning said. "He's a rookie. He was rustier than I thought  he would be after the layoff. He does not panic. And he does not let mistakes  bind him for the next play or the future."  </P> <P> The Seattle game was not only Tolliver's first regular-season NFL start, it was  also his first regular-season appearence. And it was his first live action of  any kind since breaking his left collarbone in the final exhibition game.  </P> <P> "I'm not happy about the way I played," Tolliver said, "but I'll live through  it."  </P> <P> The activation of quarterback Mark Vlasic now appears out of the question.  Vlasic injured his knee late last season. And Henning said he will probably  remain on the Physically Unable To Perform list the rest of the year.  </P> <P> The Chargers, whose offense has scored just four touchdowns in its last four  games, have dropped to 26th in NFL offense and 27th in passing. Their 129 first  downs are the fewest in the AFC.  </P> <P> Charger fans aren't the only ones suffering. This letter to the sports editor  appeared in the Sunday edition of the Seattle Times/Post Intelligencer:  </P> <P> "I am a die-hard Seahawk fan, but after the loss to Denver (24-21 in overtime  Oct. 22) my neighbors found me with my head under my bed in the fetal position.  I just can't take it any more; it is too hard to be a Seahawk fan.  </P> <P> "It is so much easier to be a 49er fan because you know they are going to win.  It is even easier to be a Lions fan because you know they're going to lose. At  least they are consistent."  </P> <P> Another letter on the same page: "I am sick of excuses. I am sick of cliches. I  want action. I want results. Good or bad, it is time to do something. The  Seahawks are broken and somebody better fix them."  </P> <P> If the Seahawks (4-4), are broken, what are the Chargers (2-6)?  </P> <P> Make no mistake, though, Seattle and San Diego are two distinctly different  places. Another headline in the same Seattle sports section read: "Miserable  Weather May Bring 'Super' Elk Season."  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Charger Coach Dan Henning said the status of H-back Rod Bernstine is "up in the  air" for Sunday's home game against the Eagles (6-2). Bernstine is still  recovering from arthroscopic surgery on his left knee and has missed the last  three games. . . . The Chargers' average margin of defeat in their last four  games is 4.25 points. . . . One measure of how bad the Charger offense is is  reflected in a defensive statistic: The Chargers have allowed 54 third-down  conversions, most in the league. The reason: The average time of possession for  the Charger offense is 27:01 minutes per game, fourth-worst in the league. . .  . Philadelphia, Sunday's Charger opponent, leads the league in interceptions  with 19 and fumble recoveries with 13.  </P></p>

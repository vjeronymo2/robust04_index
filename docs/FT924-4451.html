			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar House For all the new faces and upright accounting policies, Trafalgar House has yet to demonstrate a really fresh approach. The Pounds 138m property write-down in yesterday's full year figures looks like the sweep of a new broom but, judging by the standards of other property developers, there could be more to come. That Trafalgar ended the year only a shade above the minimum net worth specified by its loan covenants simply adds to the suspicion that it could have gone further. With the earnings figure so muddied, the market might prefer to look at cash flow. Trafalgar sees a balanced cash position this year at an operating level. Equally there seems little scope for paying down debt without disposals. Selling the mid-market cruise ships and the smaller London hotels will help but that will only make a small dent in net debt over Pounds 450m once guarantees to associated companies are included. The Ritz may prove more of a problem. Trafalgar can comfortably fund capital expenditure in engineering and its existing property commitments, but there seems little hope of it finding the extra funds needed to develop its commercial property assets. As the company indicated yesterday, joint ventures could be the solution. One can only trust Hongkong Land not to take advantage of its privileged position to cherry-pick the best of these assets. But since Trafalgar has cut the final dividend and left the way open for another reduction next year, Hongkong Land's option to buy more stock at 85p is the only convincing prop for the shares.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Foreign Affairs: Time to tune the machinery - The UN Security Council summit has called attention to imbalances in membership Last week's UN Security Council meeting at summit level had a largely symbolic character. It was, in its own words, 'a timely recognition of the fact that there are new, favourable international circumstances under which the Security Council has begun to fulfil more effectively its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security'. In short, an act of collective self-congratulation. That does not make it necessarily a bad thing. The Security Council is a useful institution. It is good that its members should be publicly associated with it at the highest level, so that political leaders have a personal stake in its success. It is good that it be seen to be giving a lead to the UN as a whole, and it was especially appropriate that it shone the spotlight on the new secretary-general, giving him a firm mandate, with a deadline of July 1, to report back with specific recommendations for 'strengthening and making more efficient . . . the capacity of the United Nations for preventive diplomacy, for peacemaking and peacekeeping'. The preventive side has definitely been the UN's weak point up to now, while peacekeeping is a growth industry whose financial and logistical requirements urgently need to be re-thought. But the meeting shone the spotlight even more blindingly on the Security Council itself, and some of those on stage to take the bow could be seen to blink. Of none was this truer than the man chiefly responsible for switching on the spotlight, the British prime minister. The meeting was above all Mr John Major's idea, which means that it was by no means unconnected with the approaching British general election. (Nothing in Mr Major's mind at this moment could possibly be.) Nobody involved in preparations for the meeting was unaware of the British government's determination to hold it on or before January 31, while Britain still held the Security Council presidency. Another purpose of the summit was, of course, to enthrone Mr Boris Yeltsin's Russian Federation in the seat formerly labelled 'Soviet Union'. Mr Yeltsin performed well, by all accounts, but his physical presence cannot change the transparent sleight of hand which has been perpetrated. The five permanent members of the Security Council are listed by name in the UN Charter. One of them is the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Russia is not mentioned. One might think that the disappearance of one of the five permanent members made it necessary as well as opportune to review the Charter in general, and the permanent membership of the Security Council in particular. But that was not what the present permanent members wanted, and especially not Britain and France. For if the General Assembly were to embark on the procedure for amending the Charter, many of its members would certainly insist on a much more radical restructuring of the Security Council. The 'change of name' approach was much more convenient, not least because it was much less conspicuous. Or at least it would have been, had not the Security Council called attention to it by holding last week's summit. A specially awkward fact was the presence of the Japanese prime minister, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa. Japan is currently serving a term as one of the 10 non-permanent members, but considers, with good reason, that it has at least as good a claim as Britain and France to permanent membership. Mr Miyazawa pointedly called for a change in the Security Council's composition to reflect 'the realities of the new era', and just in case anyone failed to get the message, his spokesman told reporters that Japan contributed more to the UN budget than Britain and France combined, and aimed to achieve permanent membership by 1995. Mr Major was thus thrown on to the defensive in what was supposed to be his hour of triumph. He fell back on the old argument, 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it'. The Security Council was working well, he said in a BBC World Service interview. Now was not the time to tinker with its composition. That argument will not convince many people. When the Security Council was not working, its composition was low on the list of most government's priorities. But the better it works, the more power it wields, the more people are going to care who is on it and whether they have a veto or not. Indeed, the whole rationale for last week's meeting was that now is the time to improve the UN's machinery, since the end of the Cold War has provided an opportunity. Mr Major may think the composition of the Security Council is not one of the aspects that needs improving, but many others disagree. Even within the British and US governments it is almost a cliche to say that Japan and Germany must somehow be induced to take on global political responsibilities more commensurate with their economic strength. This is hardly consistent with denying them the most responsible position in the UN system. It is sometimes suggested that there is a connection between permanent membership and nuclear power status. This is historically quite inaccurate (the existence of nuclear weapons was not yet known when the Charter was drafted), and politically very dangerous. The last message that should be given to Germany, Japan or any other state is that only by becoming nuclear powers can they hope to acquire a top-table role in global security. Germany is not pressing its claims to permanent membership with the same vigour as Japan, and there is one strong argument against it: Europe is already heavily over-represented on the Council, both among permanent and non-permanent members (the latter because there is still a separate east European voting group). The logical solution, as the Germans are well aware, is to have a single west European permanent member - the European Union - rather than two. It will be surprising if that argument is not pressed more and more firmly on Britain and France by their European partners in the next few years. Third World countries will also put forward claims. In so far as these are based purely on claims to represent their regions they should be resisted. It is the function of the non-permanent members to represent their regions, and there is no reason to suppose that other African states wish to be permanently represented by Nigeria rather than take their own turns in rotation. The reason for having permanent members was, and is, that certain states by virtue of their size or power play such an important part in the international system that it would be foolish to attempt any major initiative without their support. The requirement of nine affirmative votes does, in any case, give the Third World a collective veto on any issue on which it is united. This could be strengthened by a requirement that all regions of the world be represented in the majority; alternatively the existing veto could be weakened by requiring two permanent members to cast it rather than one - though China would certainly object to this even if the US did not. What seems certain is that the present structure will not survive any detailed scrutiny. By organising last week's meeting and so inviting such scrutiny, Mr Major scored something of an own goal.</p>

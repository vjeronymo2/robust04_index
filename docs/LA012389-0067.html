			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAD BREAKS EVENED OUT FOR BENGALS AND 49ERS  </P> <P> Never has a Super Bowl caused so much physical pain so early. In the first 7  minutes of Super Bowl XXIII Sunday night, two players who have made major  contributions all season went down with broken legs.  </P> <P> The second injury was one of the most graphic and severe in Super Bowl history.  It happened to Tim Krumrie, the Cincinnati Bengals' Pro Bowl nose tackle, when  he stepped awkwardly while tackling San Francisco 49ers running back Roger  Craig. The damage: a broken left tibia and fibula -- the two major bones below  the knee.  </P> <P> On the third play of the game's first series, San Francisco tackle Steve  Wallace suffered a broken left fibula. After Joe Montana was hit as he threw a  10-yard completion to Craig, Montana crashed into Wallace's left leg. Wallace's  leg was bent at an awkward angle, causing his left fibula to snap.  </P> <P> With 8:06 left in the first quarter, Krumrie's season ended. On first-and-10  from the 49ers' 3, Craig broke through the middle of the line and was chased by  Krumrie. He got a grip on Craig, and as he tried to tackle him, Krumrie's left  ankle collapsed. As replays showed graphically, Krumrie went airborne to  complete the tackle, and as he did, his leg below the knee flopped grotesquely.  It obviously was broken.  </P> <P> As the injury happened, Bengals Coach Sam Wyche seemed to sense the severity of  it. He shook his head, then stared glumly at the ground.  </P> <P> The NFL said Krumrie chose to remain in the locker room and watch the game on  television. He remained there into the second half before doctors advised him  to go to a hospital. Wallace remained at the stadium.  </P> <P> Replacing Wallace was Bubba Paris, the veteran 310-pounder. In the Bengals'  basic 3-4 defense, rookie David Grant took Krumrie's place; in the four-man  line, Grant and Skip McClendon were the tackles.  </P> <P> Bengals defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau said, "It was obviously a big loss,  losing Timmy the way we did. But you've got to hand it to Grant. I thought he  played an incredible ballgame."  </P> <P> There was history staring Cincinnati Bengals kicker Jim Breech in the face, but  it was such a familiar position to be in. He'd been in the same position all  week.  </P> <P> The situation, in Sunday's Super Bowl XXIII against the San Francisco 49ers:  score tied, 13-13, with 4:25 left in the game, and a field-goal attempt of 40  yards lined up slightly left of the center of the field.  </P> <P> "I liked being in the position right then, because I probably kicked that exact  same kick 10 or 15 times this week in practice," said Breech, downcast after  the 49ers won, 20-16.  </P> <P> "There was some wind, more wind than I'd faced during the week. But I felt  good. The hold was good and the snap was good. When I kicked it, I didn't kick  it very well; it didn't hit the net or anything. But it was enough."  </P> <P> Enough then. But not enough for a victory.  </P> <P> "To be that close hurts so much," Breech said, speaking softly. "I didn't care  how we won. I didn't care if I kicked five extra points or three field goals. I  just wanted to win so bad."  </P> <P> Breech did his part. He kicked field goals of 34, 43 and 40 yards -- the only  points the Bengals' offense scored -- but got no support from the other  components of the Cincinnati offense. "And look at how great the 49ers are in  the 2-minute offense," Breech said. "I didn't think it was over when I made my  kick."  </P></p>

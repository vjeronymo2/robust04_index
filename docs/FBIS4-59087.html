			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister brother Muhammad Salim Basindwah  has denied radio and news agency reports that an Arab League  delegation will arrive in Sanaa to mediate a cease-fire. The  brother foreign minister objected to the Arab League meeting to  discuss an internal Yemeni affair, viewing such a meeting as a  serious precedent that could extend to other Arab countries in  the future. The brother foreign minister emphasized that what  is taking place in Yemen is just a confrontation by the  legitimate authorities of a rebel group that has deviated from  constitutional legitimacy.</p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS / COUNTY SUPERVISORS;  </P> <P> WIEDER, NEUGEBAUER SPAR OVER ATTENDANCE RECORD, MEDFLY, JAIL  </P> <P> County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder and Westminster Councilwoman Joy L.  Neugebauer clashed repeatedly Wednesday in the first face-to-face encounter of  their campaign for Wieder's 2nd Supervisorial District seat.  </P> <P> In the debate, taped at the studios of KOCE-TV, Neugebauer wasted no time  attacking Wieder, a board member since 1978, using her introductory statement  to blast the incumbent for missing 23 board meetings in the last 21 months and  abstaining on 69 votes over that period.  </P> <P> "In 18 years of City Council service, I have missed three meetings," Neugebauer  said. "I have never abstained because of conflict."  </P> <P> Wieder responded by saying that Neugebauer's attack represented a lack of  knowledge and information and that many of her absences were due to her  attending to other important county business.  </P> <P> "It's not where you are, but what you're doing. The bottom line is what you  contribute," Wieder said. "Mudslinging doesn't get anywhere."  </P> <P> Neugebauer also attacked Wieder for a vote she cast last year to declare a  state of emergency in the county in accordance with the state's malathion  spraying program for the Mediterranean fruit fly. In subsequent votes, Wieder  voted against the emergency declaration.  </P> <P> "Let's get our facts straight," Wieder said. "Of the five members of the board,  there were two of us who did not vote for allowing" the state of emergency.  </P> <P> When she was not rebutting criticism from Neugebauer, Wieder used her time to  remind voters of what she sees as the highlights of her 12 years on the Board  of Supervisors: bringing together warring sides to preserve the Bolsa Chica  wetlands; creating a network of "super streets," including Beach Boulevard, a  major artery in the 2nd District; formulating a plan to increase access to  health care for the county's poor; and trying to improve the county's air  quality.  </P> <P> When Neugebauer was asked why voters should choose her over Wieder, she  answered: "My strongest asset is that I am not an expert on anything. Every  issue that comes before me deserves every inch of my attention span."  </P> <P> Both candidates said they oppose Measure M, the proposed half-cent sales tax  for transportation improvements, although for different reasons. Neugebauer  said she objects to the measure's 20-year plan, particularly its provision to  expand the use of car-pool lanes. Wieder said she thinks the measure is good  but "cannot vote for it" because county voters have shown repeatedly that they  oppose tax increases for transportation.  </P> <P> Neugebauer called, instead, for increased funding for new freeways but did not  clearly specify where the new money would come from.  </P> <P> Wieder used her opponent's omission to her advantage.  </P> <P> "There's no magic wand, no bank to be robbed, no largess to find from  someplace," Wieder said. "Building more freeways is something the populace of  Orange County does not want."  </P> <P> The candidates also differed on where a new county jail should be built, with  Wieder favoring the current plan to place it in Gypsum Canyon and Neugebauer  opting for Rancho del Rio, a ranch seized by narcotics agents in remote South  County.  </P> <P> Neugebauer never raised the issue of Wieder's false claim until two years ago  of a college degree, an issue that cost her dearly in her unsuccessful 1988 bid  for Congress. After the debate, Neugebauer said the issue just "never came up,"  although she does intend to use it in her mail campaign.  </P> <P> Wednesday's debate airs Oct. 25 at 6:30 p.m. on Channel 50. The candidates go  at it again today at 12:30 p.m. in a live debate in the Golden West College  Student Center.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Mine-sweeping operations along the former inner  German border will be completed by the end of the year. This is  what a spokesman for the responsible authority in Magdeburg told  DDP. He said the blasters were primarily removing plastic mines  with loads of up to 200 grams. Between 1961 and 1985, more than  1.5 million mines were reportedly laid along the former border.</p>

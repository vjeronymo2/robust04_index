			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Leading Article: The day of decision THE BRITISH electorate, to judge by the opinion polls, is about to vote into power either a minority Labour government or - just possibly - a Labour government with a tiny overall majority. That is not the choice of business, which would prefer an outright winner to resolve political uncertainties, and would much prefer that winner to be Conservative. But despite its risks and short-term costs, the likely outcome may be in the best longer-term interests of the UK. The Financial Times's values are closer to those of a modern Conservative party than to any other - that it is to say, a belief in the market economy, a limited role for the state, low taxation and maximum freedom of choice. But there are three serious reservations about the present government's being offered an unprecedented fourth term of office. The first is performance. It is hard to overstate the achievements of Conservative governments in the 1980s: trade union reform, privatisation, disciplined public finances and an open economy are just the most obvious. Since the last election in 1987, however, serious economic mistakes have been made, as those responsible have recently admitted, and there have been fatal signs of hubris - most notably in the poll tax disaster. In his 16 months as prime minister, Mr Major deserves credit for scrapping the poll tax, for his Maastricht deal and for holding firm to a difficult economic course, but some of his new ideas have either been superficial, like the Citizen's Charter, or fumbled, like the reform of British Rail. Real weakness The second is promise. The shortcomings of the Tory campaign have not been the result only of poor presentation. Rather they reflect a real weakness at the heart of Tory policymaking. The party has not yet come to terms with the departure of Mrs Thatcher, and is suffering an identity crisis as a result. Does it stand for Thatcherism with a soft voice - if such a thing is plausible - or has it become something completely different, such as a European-style Christian Democratic party? It has almost nothing to say about the need to reform the way the country is governed, even though it is now clear that change is both inevitable and desirable. The party's manifesto is a job lot of ideas with little sense of drive or direction. The third reservation is that, as the electorate has correctly sensed, a healthy democracy requires change and choice in the character of its government; if only one party has power of patronage, stagnation is a real danger. It would require very compelling arguments to re-elect any party after 13 years in power: the Tories look as if they have run out of steam, and need to rethink their priorities away from the cares of office. But although there are reservations about the Conservatives, there are also serious worries about the alternatives. To some audiences, the Labour party talks the language of the markets; to others, it urges a break with the enhanced competitive spirit which lies at the heart of Britain's improved economic performance since Labour was last in office. In the very tough economic circumstances which face the next government of Britain, no-one can be sure which of these voices will be decisive. Labour's campaign has promised enhanced economic performance which nothing in its programme suggests it can deliver. In that case, the public spending ambitions of its manifesto will be unattainable and its most loyal supporters angrily disappointed. Backward look Most worrying of all, Labour is in many policy areas looking backwards to a better future. Its proposals on health, its instincts on education and its meritless minimum wage are the most striking examples. The speed and scale of its tax distribution proposals are unjust and will damage Britain's competitiveness. The message of the polls is that the public is fearful of either of these large parties' forming the next government. In spite of four weeks of intense campaigning, neither has put on a solid, single point in its opinion poll rating. The only party which can make that claim is the Liberal Democrat, but its own identity is an uneasy blend of single-issue pressure group and would-be coalition partner. The spending figures in its manifesto do not add up, and its myriad policies combine the good, such as an independent central bank, with the gimmicky, such as a hypothecated tax for education. The party's slick image cannot conceal the incoherence of its recent history. All this points to the likelihood of an indecisive judgment by the voters; a hung parliament, during which the prime minister will have to look over his shoulder at every step. No party is trusted to go it alone with a strong majority. It is possible to view this prospect with some equanimity, however, precisely because Britain's last strong and effective government - namely the first two administrations of Mrs Thatcher - achieved so much that is irreversible. Labour looks likely to be behind the steering wheel. The right role of any back seat drivers will be to nurture Labour's market-oriented instincts and to give it courage against the desire to slip into reverse. If a stable seating plan for passengers can be agreed, so much the better, though no one should think it would be easily achieved. The best hope is that with strong coaxing, Labour in office can shed its reactionary alter ego and become the outward looking social democratic party which represents the only viable destination for the left in European politics. If this election were solely a choice between party leaders, Mr Major would be preferable. But it is not. The dangers of perpetuating in power a weakened and uncertain Conservative party, set alongside the progress Labour has made in modernising itself, justify by a fine margin the risks of a change.</p>

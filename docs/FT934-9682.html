			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (19): Small hotels can often fit the bill - Gillian Upton looks at the alternative to staying at the big chains SOME world-weary business travellers appear to be deserting the big, impersonal hotel chains for smaller, cosier counterparts that offer more personalised service. In the main, the companies with huge volumes of business are staying loyal to the big, international hotel chains because of their preferential rates (small hotels generally do not offer corporate rates), and ease of booking through one-number reservations for worldwide coverage. But for frequent independent travellers, those with an eye on costs or with a smaller travel budget and therefore less buying muscle, these small hotels fit the bill. Your custom would represent a substantial portion of business for a 50-room hotel and therefore you would be a name and not a number in such an establishment. Rates hover in the Pounds 120 to Pounds 130 price bracket a night, compared with a larger hotel charging around Pounds 200 a night; no small saving over a couple of nights' stay. While corporate rates are not always openly disclosed, some small hotels offer 'special arrangements' on volume of bed nights. That enables individuals or companies to trade down in a surreptitious way, as it will be seen as 'moving across' more than anything. Such 'boutique' or 'townhouse' hotels, as they are sometimes known, have up until now been exclusively found in Europe but the concept is spreading much farther afield now. Central London boasts more than a dozen such estabishments, all claiming to offer the recognition, service levels and ambience in a 50-room-or-less property that is often lacking in hotels with over 250 guest bedrooms. One experienced traveller's comment: 'It's home from home' sums up the general reaction to these smaller hotels. They are proving particularly attractive to women business travellers, who feel more comfortable in smaller establishments, many of which are managed by women. Of course, these smaller hotels may lack an enormous lobby, a business centre, health club and the choice of half a dozen food and beverage outlets, but personal service makes up for many of the so-called shortcomings. London's oldest, small hotel is probably the Capital, its 1970s facade in Basil Street, Knightsbridge, giving no clue to its more tasteful interior. It has only 48 rooms, a bar and restaurant, and a thoroughly good concierge. It is one of the more expensive small hotels; single rooms start from Pounds 184. Much cheaper is the Egerton House (singles from Pounds 110 plus VAT) in Egerton Terrace, Knightsbridge, which offers 30 bedrooms. While there is no bar (only a breakfast room), guests can serve themselves from a drinks cabinet. Smaller still is the Fenja with just 14 rooms (no restaurant) in Cadogan Gardens, Knightsbridge, and with rooms costing from Pounds 130. No bar, again, but each room is stocked with decanters of spirits together with mixers and soft drinks. Still in Knightsbridge, rates at the 28-roomed Beaufort (Beaufort Gardens) start at Pounds 115. There is no restaurant but a 24-hour self-service bar adjacent to the drawing room. Lack of a restaurant at 22 Jermyn Street (comprising 13 suites and five studios) has been overcome by the nearby restaurant, Green's, offering dinner in your room from its elaborate menu. The hotel does, however, serve breakfast and has a 24-hour room service menu. Rooms start from Pounds 145. Outside London, there are also some good small hotels. The 40-bed Old Parsonage in Oxford, Etrop Grange in Manchester, 42 The Calls in Leeds and 1 Devonshire Gardens in Glasgow all come to mind. Across the Channel, Brussels has had its own boutique hotel, the Stanhope, for two years. Some 50 rooms have been shaped from a terrace of three period houses on the western side of the EC capital and decorated like an English country house, with much trompe-l'oeil and swathes of fabric in evidence. The hotel has two boardrooms and fax machines are available on request. Rates are from BFr9,500 for a single. Similar in style is the Montgomery. Breakfast is the only regular meal served but room service is available around the clock, in guest bedrooms or in the library. Each bedroom comes equipped with a fax machine. Rates from BFr9,000. A townhouse-style property has turned up in Singapore in stark contrast to the modern glass and steel skyscraper hotels for which the island state is known. The Duxton is a 50-room hotel built from eight trading houses and located near the Tanjong Pagar metro. There is no business centre, pool or garden, but a French restaurant, bar, pavement cafe, secretarial services and airport car transfer make up for them. Standard rooms start at SDollars 230 and are bookable through TRI Hotel Marketing. Mr Colin Rainbow, commercial director of pan-European travel agency chain Wagons-lits, says that such hotels will 'inevitably give you a more personal service. It's a big difference from being number 42 in line at the Hilton in New York with 18 check-in desks.' Nonetheless, industry observers believe the townhouse hotel sector in the UK has grown 300 per cent over the past three years, albeit from a very small base. 'The hotel market is being redivided and the big hotels are finding it difficult,' claims Mr Nigel Massey, managing director of the Massey Partnership, a marketing and public relations agency which specialises in small, privately-owned hotels. 'The Franklin ran at 84 per cent occupancy in its first year, the Old Parsonage at 75 per cent,' says Mr Massey. 'They represent a return to traditional hotelkeeping, where bookers can talk to the owner of the hotel.' The big chains do have their own, smaller 'hotel within hotel' in the shape of their executive floors, with separate entrance, check-in, lounge, complimentary breakfast and canapes. These go some way to redress the balance between large and small hotels.</p>

			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Management: A fairer slice of the pie - How companies are approaching the thorny issue of revamping their executive share options British Aerospace has undeniably done well for its shareholders in the last two years. But whether John Cahill, the chairman, really deserves a Pounds 3.2m profit on his executive share options for his role in the recovery is another matter. Institutional investors have long felt that something is rotten in the way most option schemes are designed, and are preparing for a battle over the need to link them more closely to performance. The very size of the Cahill profit is further grist to the mill for those who believe executive share options have more to do with roulette than rationality. This year shareholders are faced with a chance to address the problem. Most of the existing 10-year schemes were introduced in 1984 to take advantage of tax breaks, and now have to be renewed. The occasion is the cause of great controversy. Options matter to shareholders for two reasons. The first is that they are the only part of a manager's overall pay on which investors have the chance to vote; they therefore become the focus for all concerns on the excesses of executive remuneration. Second, they can be worth a lot of money. Sometimes - as in Cahill's case - they are the largest part of the total, but even in less headline-grabbing cases they can still be significant. A survey published today by Incomes Data Services, the pay analysts, shows the average value of 154 options cashed in recently was nearly Pounds 55,000, with the range stretching from Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 1m. Nearly all shareholders agree that existing schemes are flawed. Typically, a handful of senior executives are entitled to buy shares (worth up to four times their salary) at today's price in three years' time. If the share price rises, they stand to gain no matter how poor the company's relative performance has been. Yet there is still disagreement on the best way to go forward. The two main investor bodies, the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds, agree that schemes should be tied to a performance yardstick, but have spent months debating which measure was best. The ABI pushed for earnings per share while the NAPF argued for share price performance relative to the stock market. The compromise reached last summer is that each company should choose the measure that suits it best. Any company which fails to comply runs the risk of having its scheme voted down by shareholders. Even this solution is not accepted by everyone. M &amp; G, the unit trust group (ironically itself a big institutional investor in other companies), has ruffled feathers recently with its own new scheme which does not include any performance measure at all. Paddy Linaker, managing director of M &amp; G, justifies the move by arguing that it is hard to find an appropriate benchmark; earnings per share can be distorted by accounting changes, and share prices can be skewed by a number of factors including takeovers. Worse, he fears, a benchmark could make the behaviour of mangers short term, could fail to reward companies that have done well in difficult circumstances, or could encourage managers to be reckless in the hope of meeting targets. Some companies agree with him but cannot follow suit, as unlike M &amp; G they do not have loyal controlling shareholders to vote such a scheme through. 'Most companies seem prepared to comply with the guidelines, but without any enthusiasm,' says Mark Anderson of New Bridge Street Consultants. Richard Regan of the ABI denies that companies are reluctant. 'Most managements have said Amen to this, because they want their executives to perform.' According to Nicki Demby of Arthur Andersen the range in schemes being introduced is enormous. Grand Metropolitan was one of the first to bring in a relative share price yardstick, with options that can only be exercised if the shares outperform the FT-SE 100. BP, meanwhile, has decided to measure itself against the rest of the oil sector. Trafalgar House is leaving it vague, saying that the relevant board committee will decide on the best performance measure closer to the time. The Daily Mail's options scheme is dependent on its earnings growth exceeding inflation. The most radical plan announced so far is from Reuters, which has decided to scrap its options scheme altogether and replace it with a restricted share scheme. This entitles directors to receive regular instalments of shares so long as the company is performing. The better the company does, the more shares the directors will get. Reuters has chosen to measure its performance against total shareholder returns (share price plus dividend) of the top 100 companies. 'I am trying to make Reuters look at itself in the same way as investors do,' says Sir Christopher Hogg, chairman of Reuters. So far the company's plan has been greeted with guarded interest both by other companies and shareholders. There are few precedents for it in the UK and, while in the US restricted shares are commonplace, not many have this sort of performance measure attached to them. Even Sir Christopher is a little uncertain as to how it will work. 'It's suck it and see,' he says. He points out that if directors find themselves getting too many or too few shares, the remuneration committee will simply change the rules. The Reuters scheme is one of the few likely to meet with the grudging approval of one shareholder group, the Pensions and Investment Research Consultants. Last week PIRC wrote to its pension fund clients advising them to vote against all new options schemes unless they were radically altered. Anne Simpson, a PIRC director, argues that share options are a poor motivator as executives can only gain but not lose money, and that they do not encourage share ownership as executives tend to cash in their gains at once. Moreover, she complains that executive options are inequitable as they are only open to a minute proportion of the workforce - while the real credit for success should be spread more widely. PIRC's recommendation that all schemes be voted down unless they are open to all employees is unrealistic. Indeed it would mean that only a tiny handful of companies would be given the go-ahead. However, says Simpson, the aim of the recommendation is not to overturn all schemes now but to keep up the pressure on boards to bear such things in mind as integrity and equity when it comes to setting pay.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Rm"-signed report: "Late, Too Late"] </F>   [Text] Two U.S. combat planes on Sunday evening [10 April]  attacked a tank and a common position of the Serbian Armed  Forces near Gorazde. The expectations that the Serbs would stop  their artillery attacks on the city because of that was naive,  since they have had encouraging experiences with the United  Nations and the Western powers. They have waged their war of  conquest since 1991. Only at the beginning of 1994 did the  United Nations and NATO decide to take action; four Serbian  planes were shot down. But that was not a sign to the aggressor  that if he does not stop the war, he will be forced to do that.  Rather, this was only a sanction because the Serbs had ignored  the no-fly zone. The bombs last Sunday evening were dropped to  protect the UN observers in Gorazde, which had been bombed to  rubble by Serbian artillery. The matter can be presented in  such a way that the observers were sent to protect the people,  which means that protecting the blue helmets also means  protecting the civilian population. The Serbian leadership,  however, must feel encouraged that the United Nations still did  not want to explain a minor, symbolic intervention with the  intention to put an end to the Serbian massacres. It did not  even take a day for the Serbian artillery to start shooting at  Gorazde again.    Now, it is as if the United Nations and the Western powers  were awakening from their self-hypnotized sleep. They see that  further action is necessary. But what can be done now since the  Serbs in Bosnia have practically achieved their war goal? There  is still help for Gorazde, but it is probably too late for  Bosnia.    President Milosevic in Belgrade is complaining about losing  the illusion that the community of states is neutral in Bosnia.  This was not an illusion, it was reality. So far, the United  Nations and the Western powers watched the Serbian war as  neutrals between aggressor and victims. However, it was a  limping neutrality; the arms embargo against Croatia and Bosnia  made the war of conquest even easier to Serbia, which is far  superior anyway. At a late time, the civilized world is now  nerving itself up to intervening haltingly. However, it cannot  make good what it missed at the beginning of the war.</p>

Zou told the Indian guest that Sino-Indian ties have grown  smoothly in recent years, and China will actively engage in  cooperation with other countries, especially its neighbors.    He said the Chinese Government supports China's petroleum  industry in its efforts to cooperate with foreign countries.    Zou noted that China adheres to two principles in such  relations, namely, equality and mutual benefit, and long-term  cooperation.    He hoped that Sino-Indian cooperation in the fields of oil  and natural gas would develop without a hitch.    Sharma and his party, guests of the China National Petroleum  and Gas Corporation, arrived in Beijing on June 26.    In his meeting with Desmarais and his party, Zou said China  welcomes the Canadian Power Corporation to enter into  cooperation with China in power, mining and other fields.

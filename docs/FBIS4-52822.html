			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 13 (YONHAP) -- No North Korean logger has  applied yet to come to South Korea or to settle in Russia,  Moscow's ambassador to Seoul Georgiy Kunadze said Friday [13  May].    If there are any such requests, Moscow will handle them on a  case-by-case basis, reviewing them carefully while taking into  consideration the applicants' wishes from a humanitarian point  of view, the ambassador said in an interview with YONHAP News  Agency.    South Korean President Kim Yong-sam is scheduled to visit  Russia in June.    On the timing of the first resettlement of North Korean  loggers, Kunadze said that in addition to the screening process,  a presidential decision is necessary on procedural matters and  this always requires time.    Asked about North Korea's nuclear capability, the ambassador  said that according to a recent special report by a Russian  intelligence agency, there are no signs that Pyongyang has  nuclear bombs or the ability to acquire them anytime soon.    But Moscow is concerned that the North Korean nuclear  problem  has been clouded by uncertainty for over a year. Kunadze  expressed hope that the various channels of dialogue such as  between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA), North Korea and the United States, and South-North Korea  will make progress and succeed.    On compensation for the victims of a downed Korean air  plane,  the envoy said his home government is preparing a reply which  will come soon.    The ambassador then commented on the North Korea-Soviet  Friendship and Mutual Assistance Treaty that stipulates Moscow  will automatically intervene in case of a war involving  Pyongyang, explaining that Moscow's position is that the treaty  remains in effect.    But the automatic intervention clause applies only to  unprovoked military incidents, he said, and it is up to Russia  to decide whether an incident was provoked or not.    He predicted that the issue involving the return of the old  Russian legation site in Chung-dong, Seoul, is unlikely to be  solved by the time President Kim visits.    But he suggested that the two sides are near an agreement,  saying the matter might be resolved in the near future.    The ambassador discussed South Korean-Russian technology  cooperation in the defense industry, emphasizing that no  obstacles exist and such links will be of mutual benefit.    But there should be no double standards and no political  influence in trying to boost cooperation, he said.</p>

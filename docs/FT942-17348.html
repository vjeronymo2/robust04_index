			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up TURKEY Equities in Istanbul gained nearly 9 per cent yesterday on expectations that the government will today unveil a package of measures to tackle inflation and reduce the budget deficit. The equity market has seen volatile trading in recent sessions, rising 11 per cent last week, but falling 9 per cent the week before. The composite index remains some 21 per cent down on the year to date. Recent activity has been driven mainly by domestic investors, as foreign institutions wait for the situation to clarify. Many investors were taking advantage yesterday of cheap prices to buy. The government's measures are expected to include job cuts and privatisation of many state companies. BEIJING China has launched an Dollars 11.5bn domestic bond issue - its biggest ever  -to help cover the budget deficit and the increasing debt-service obligations of its vast infrastructure programme. Western bankers and economists say that plans to issue some Yn100bn (Dollars 11.5bn) in two and three-year bonds are highly ambitious, and will severely test the Chinese debt markets. The three-year bonds will carry an interest rate of 13.96 per cent. This compares with increases in the cost of living running at more than 20 per cent in the larger cities. Huaneng International Power Development, a unit of state energy group Huaneng, has said that it has obtained approval for a global share issue and primary listing on the NYSE this year. BUCHAREST Bankcoop, a Romanian private bank, is to launch a share issue to raise its capital to around 12bn lei (Dollars 7.2m), a bank official has said. Bankcoop will sell its shares to Romanian and foreign companies and individuals. Last year the bank had a pre-tax profit of 14bn lei, up from a post-tax profit of 3.1bn lei in 1992. MEXICO Foreign investment in Mexico totalled Dollars 4.09bn in the first two months of 1994, an increase of 143.4 per cent over the same period a year ago, the trade ministry has said. The ministry said foreign investment now totals Dollars 45.8bn during the administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who took office in December 1988. The ministry said Dollars 3.17bn, or 77.6 per cent, of foreign investment in January and February was channelled through Mexico's stock market, and the remaining Dollars 916m was in direct investment. Some 70.5 per cent of the new investment came from the US, with Spain accounting for 6.5 per cent, Germany for 1.2 per cent and Canada for 0.7 per cent. OMAN Oman is to sell shares in more government-held companies in 1994 and link its stock market with Bahrain as part of the process of opening its economy to private and foreign investment. A stock exchange official said that Oman and Bahrain were to link their stock markets by listing public joint-stock companies in each market by the end of the year. A Bahrain official has said that Oman will set up two international funds for Japanese and UK groups to invest. Oman's stock market lists 93 companies capitalised at Dollars 1.6bn. Annual turnover is about Dollars 60m. Further coverage of emerging markets appears daily on the World Stock Markets page.</p>

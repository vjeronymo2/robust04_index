			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / S African parties back safeguards for minorities SOUTH AFRICAN political parties have agreed in principle to include protection for minorities in a new constitution, one of the most sensitive issues in multi-party democracy talks. The parties, meeting in the forum known as the Convention For a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), have yet to discuss detailed proposals for protecting minorities, a bottom-line demand of the National Party government before any deal on a post-apartheid constitution. Working out a final plan will take time. But government ministers yesterday welcomed the fact that the Codesa working group charged with drawing up constitutional principles had agreed that 'meaningful participation by political minorities' should be one of them. That phrase is National party shorthand for protection of minorities, mainly whites. Yesterday, the party released details of its proposals on this issue. Mr Tertius Delport, deputy constitutional development minister, said mere representation for minorities - for example, a white block of seats in parliament - would not guarantee 'meaningful participation', since that block would be outvoted by the majority. The National Party's plan relies on the principle of consensus decision-making, with minorities given a disproportionately large say in government policy at central, regional and local government levels, with maximum devolution of power. The National Party said yesterday that normal liberal democratic protections such as a bill of rights, an independent judiciary and mechanisms to prevent abuse of power were insufficient to prevent domination in South Africa's racially and culturally diverse society. It cited Belgium, where the cabinet includes an equal number of French- and Dutch-speaking ministers (apart from the prime minister), and where a principle of parity applies in other government structures down to local level. The statement insisted such protections should be entrenched in a constitution; the African National Congress says coalition government must develop naturally. Mr Roelf Meyer, defence minister, sought to reassure whites that government would not surrender control of police or army during transition from white rule, though joint control could be implemented if passed by parliament. Black township violence and rising crime in white areas are likely to be central to the right-wing Conservative Party's campaign for a vote against political reform in the referendum. The neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB) has reversed its decision to boycott the March 17 referendum and has joined the Conservative Party's campaign for a 'no' vote.</p>

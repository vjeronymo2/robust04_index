			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Dolphin Packaging edges ahead to Pounds 1.15m midway Dolphin Packaging, which supplies its products mainly to the food industry, reported near-static turnover and profits for the half year to end-June. On turnover marginally up from Pounds 12.6m to Pounds 12.7m pre-tax profits were ahead slightly from Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 1.15m. Earnings came out at 3.47p (3.42p) per share and the interim dividend is maintained at 1.7p. Mr Moger Wooley, chairman, said that raw materials costs had been rising at 30 to 40 per cent a year. These increases were too great to be absorbed, he said, and would have to be passed on to customers. Mr Wooley also announced he was to retire in the new year. The post of chairman would be filled by Mr Harry Evans, currently chief executive, who will be succeeded by Mr David Marsh.</p>

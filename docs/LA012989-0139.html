			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TROJANS TRY TO GET LOAD OFF THEIR MINDS  </P> <P> George Raveling, USC basketball coach, used new tactics to prepare the Trojans  for today's game against Washington State.  </P> <P> Rebounding drills?  </P> <P> No.  </P> <P> Free throw drills?  </P> <P> No.  </P> <P> Would you believe wheelbarrow racing?  </P> <P> In a scene that could have been from a company picnic, the Trojans were divided  into two squads for wheelbarrow and piggyback races at the start of Friday's  practice. The losers had to do 25 push-ups.  </P> <P> Although it looked bizarre, there was a method to Raveling's apparent madness.  He was trying to ease the tension that has mounted during USC's 7-game losing  streak.  </P> <P> "You need to loosen them up a little bit and let them know it's still fun,"  Raveling said. "I'm trying to get them in the right mind set. They're still a  little shell-shocked."  </P> <P> When the fun ended, the Trojans got down to business, working on more  conventional basketball skills.  </P> <P> USC's players appreciated the deviation from their normal routine.  </P> <P> "It broke up the monotony of coming out and doing the same drills every day,"  said guard Rich Grande. "Everyone knows that we're losing but I don't think  anyone has given up."  </P> <P> USC is 7-11 overall, 0-7 in the Pac-10 and has lost 7 straight games.  Washington State is 6-11 and 1-7 and has lost its last 6. Kelvin Sampson,  Washington State's coach, has called today's game a battle for the Pac-10  cellar.  </P> <P> It's an accurate description. USC is 10th in the Pacific-10 and Washington  State is ninth. After building a 13-point lead in Thursday night's game against  UCLA, Washington State lost, 64-63, on Trevor Wilson's last-second tip-in.  </P> <P> Wilson followed his own missed shot, going around Brian Quinnett for the  rebound, which led to the game-winning shot.  </P> <P> Quinnett, a 6-foot 9-inch forward, is Washington State's top player. After  sitting out last season with a broken foot, he is averaging 18 points and 6  rebounds.  </P> <P> Trojan Notes  </P> <P> Today's game is a homecoming for George Raveling, who coached at Washington  State for 11 years. . . . Center Chris Munk has been playing well in the last 4  games, averaging 11 points and 9 rebounds in that span, compared to his season  averages of 7.0 and 6.5.  </P></p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Search for a way to stay afloat: John Willman explains why social security reforms could cut unemployment Full employment is back at the top of the policy agenda. At a conference on Tuesday organised by the UK Trades Union Congress, Mr David Hunt, the Conservative employment secretary, as well as business and union leaders, committed themselves to cutting jobless queues to the minimum. Mr Hunt was candid enough to point out that there remains disagreement over how full employment is to be achieved. There is a gulf between those who see low inflation and deregulation as the way forward and those who want reflationary policies. But there is a growing consensus that, if full employment is to be realised, reforms to the social security system are needed. 'A welfare state created 50 years ago needs modernising if it is to encourage the labour market flexibility that is widely seen as essential to competitiveness in the global economy,' says Mr Andrew Dilnot, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The need for social security reform arises from the changing nature of work. As last month's jobs study from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development pointed out, many of the new jobs emerging in the advanced economies are low-productivity, low-wage jobs. The gap between the better paid and the worst paid is widening in most countries, according to a recent IFS study. In the UK, hourly wages of the lowest-paid men have fallen in real terms since 1976, while in the US below median wages have been falling for the past 20 years. In many countries, welfare systems discourage the unemployed from accepting new jobs which offer wages close to - or even below - the level of benefits paid to the unemployed. The OECD study recommended that social security systems should pay benefits to people who take up low-paid jobs to ensure that they are better off in work than on the dole. The UK is the only large European country to have attempted to go down that path with Family Credit, a benefit for low-paid workers with children. More than 500,000 families receive this means-tested benefit, getting an average of Pounds 42 a week tax free, to top up their income. To get Family Credit, the breadwinner must work for 16 hours or more a week and be responsible for at least one child. The amount of benefit depends on the number and age of children and the family income - based on earnings net of tax, national insurance and pension contributions. If family income is Pounds 71.70 a week (or less), the family receives the full amount of benefit. For a family with two children under 10, this would be Pounds 66.70. Such a family would also receive Pounds 18.45 a week in child benefit, so Family Credit creates an effective floor for their income of Pounds 156.85 (Pounds 71.70 + Pounds 66.70 + Pounds 18.45). So long as they claim their benefits and stay in work, they are unlikely to sink below this level. According to a recent survey by Policy Studies Institute, the independent think-tank, Family Credit leaves couples on average about Pounds 18 a week better off in work than if they gave up their jobs and took unemployment benefits. Single parents are about Pounds 30 a week better off. 'The majority of families with experience both of unemployment and working on Family Credit said they preferred being in work on Family Credit to a life on the dole,' says Mr Alan Marsh of the PSI. There have been difficulties in persuading many of the people who ought to be getting Family Credit to make a claim. However, a prolonged publicity campaign has raised take-up to about two-thirds of those eligible. Of those that don't claim, many would have been entitled to only small amounts and may have chosen not to claim. Ministers certainly regard Family Credit as having encouraged people to take low-paid jobs. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is considering extending it to cover childless couples and single people. That would add another Pounds 1bn a year to the Pounds 1.2bn already spent. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, has proposed a more fundamental overhaul of benefits both for those in work and the unemployed, to cater for the demand for greater flexibility in labour markets. Most UK benefits were designed for a world of full-time, regular work in which a male breadwinner brings home the family income. Increasingly, employers are looking for less rigid work patterns and want workers prepared to work on a part-time, casual or seasonal basis. Even with Family Credit, the benefits system still discourages unemployed people - and their partners - from accepting such flexible work. 'With benefits, we enter a kind of crystal maze of traps, tapers, withdrawals and disregards,' says Mr Davies. 'It is a maze from which many unemployed people find it hard to escape.' Unemployed people, who are entitled to Income Support, for example, can earn only small amounts each week ('disregards') without losing benefit. Any part-time income over Pounds 5 a week (Pounds 15 a week for long-term unemployed) reduces the amount of benefit pound for pound. At such low levels, accepting part-time or casual jobs could leave them worse off after travel and other work expenses. Their partners' income is similarly treated, providing an equally strong disincentive for them to seek work. A recent study found that only 12 per cent of wives of unemployed men were working more than eight hours a week, although more than half wanted to work. The result is to create 'work-poor' households reliant on benefits. The wife (it is almost always the wife) in a couple on Family Credit has a similar problem if she accepts low-paid work. Her wage will reduce - perhaps extinguish altogether - the husband's Family Credit, leaving them little or no better off. If the work is insecure, she may decide to stick with the assurance of a weekly benefit cheque. In a world where wages for the unskilled are falling, creating 'work-rich' households with both partners in work is the key to reducing dependency. Rules which make it harder for wives to take whatever work is on offer leave families trapped on a single low income and reliant on the state. One option would be to increase the disregards, which have remained at current levels for years. A disregard of Pounds 30 might allow someone to work a day a week without losing any benefit. A second option would be to allow unemployed people to accumulate their disregards across several weeks, so that they could take an occasional temporary job without coming off benefit altogether. A third option would be to reduce the rate at which benefit is cut when income is higher than the disregards. If the withdrawal rate was reduced below 100 per cent, there would be an incentive to accept casual work. More radically, separate disregards could be introduced for husband and wife. This would provide an incentive for wives to accept part-time and low-paid jobs. If it encouraged both partners into jobs, it would help narrow the gap between work-rich and work-poor households. A further deterrent to entering insecure forms of work is the difficulty recipients face in moving between benefits for the unemployed and in-work benefits. 'Life inside the benefits maze, while not exactly a life of Riley, can seem more predictable and in some ways secure than the uncertain job market,' says the CBI's Mr Davies. Taking a job means leaving Income Support and claiming Family Credit and - for tenants - Housing Benefit. Despite streamlining the system for claiming Family Credit, it can still take several weeks to receive payments. Housing Benefit can take much longer. Although benefits payments are backdated, the delay leaves a nasty gap in the finances of people who normally have little or no savings to live off. This sudden loss of income comes at a time when returning to work may involve one-off expenses, to buy tools, work clothing or transport. Some sort of return-to-work payment - perhaps set against future Family Credit payments - would bridge the gap. Alternatively, unused disregards might be rolled up to continue paying Income Support. Creating a one-stop benefits shop for the unemployed would also be a step forward. The aim would be to provide a seamless flow of benefit income for those returning to work and for those moving back from jobs that peter out. 'People don't only look at the level of income they will get by re-entering work,' says Ms Eithne McLaughlin, of Queen's University, Belfast. 'They give weight to the sources of income, including their reliability.' The good news for policymakers is that the majority of unemployed people - including the long-term unemployed - are seeking work and would prefer paid work to unemployment. The trick is to give them the confidence to make the leap from the security of the dole in an increasingly insecure labour market, confident that they will not be digging themselves into debt.</p>

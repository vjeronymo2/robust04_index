			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (7): Hotels to suit every taste - Where to stay, whether your tastes are lavish or your budget is strictly limited, the 1,400 hotels of Paris offer a wide choice ERNEST HEMINGWAY once said that he hoped heaven would be 'as good as the Ritz.' He should have known. The all-American author headed straight for the Hotel de Ritz on Place Vendome whenever he was in Paris, staying in one of its swankiest suites and holding court night after night in the bar. The Ritz returned the compliment by christening one of its bars, the Hemingway, in deference to its loyal customer. The Hemingway Bar is still there but the Ritz of today is very different from the hotel that played host to Ernest Hemingway, with its bullet-proof windows overlooking the Place Vendome, a baby jacuzzi in every room and a heliport on the roof. All the really grand Paris hotels have stories to tell. It is impossible to go into the Ritz without thinking of Hemingway reeling out of the bar, or of Coco Chanel sneaking in with her Nazi lover during the war. The Plaza-Athenee conjures images of Marlene Dietrich downing killer cocktails at the gallery tables and the Grand Hotel of the Empress Eugenie sweeping in for the gala opening with Pereire, the wily financier, by her side. Each hotel has a different personality. The Plaza-Athenee is the prettiest, and most intimate, the place where movie stars who really want to be alone stay when they are in town. The Raphael, colonised by the arts crowd, is the most decadent with a Turner in the lobby and opulent Oriental carpets disappearing along dark, deep corridors. Madonna, Michael Jackson and a caravanserai of Arab sheiks opt for the classic French grandeur of the Crillon. The super-models seem to prefer dodging the paparazzi from behind the bullet proof windows of the Ritz. The Grand Hotel, now restored to its original Garnier grandeur, is for the business community as are the Bristol and George V, which also sport troupes of Japanese tourists munching lettuce leaves for breakfast in their opulent restaurants. The bill for any grand Parisian hotel tends to be pretty steep. The Bristol, one of the most expensive of all, charges FFr5,900 to FFr10,900 a night for suites and FFr2,300 to FFr3,900 for rooms (Tel. 4266 9145). Even the Raphael, almost a snip compared to others in the luxury bracket, offers suites from FFr2,700 to FFr6,400 and rooms from FFr1,600 to FFr2,200 (Tel. 4502 1600). If your tastes are less lavish, or your budget does not quite stretch that far, there are plenty of other hotels to choose from in the city, 1,400 to be precise. The Montalembert, just off rue du Bac in Saint Germain, is the most successful of the recent breed of Paris 'designer' hotels. Christian Liaigre, the architect, has spruced up the sandstone of the original exterior and added brisk blue canopies. The interior has the same mix of the classic and the contemporary with modernist furniture against sandstone walls. The rooms are compact, but comfortable and Liaigre has succeeded in escaping the flakey feel of so many other 'designer' buildings flung up in the late 1980s by choosing natural woods and stones for his restrained designs. The Montalembert is now a popular haunt for the fashion pack who can stroll over the Seine for the pret a porter collections at the Louvre. (Hotel Montalembert, tel. 4548 6811. Rooms from FFr1,450.) L'Hotel on rue des Beaux Arts has eschewed any attempt at renovation and thrives on the shabby chic charm of its original Directoire-style decor. It has even kept the Art Deco furniture installed by Mistinguett, one of its most famous clients and one of Paris' most infamous striptease artistes, including her mirrored bedroom which decks out the honeymoon suite. For all the charm of Mistingeutt's memory L'Hotel is best known as the place where Oscar Wilde lived until his death. The Irish arterati still flock there to pay their respects, including U2, the Dublin rock super-group, who installed themselves in L'Hotel for the Paris leg of the Zoo TV tour. (L'Hotel, tel. 4325 2722. Rooms from FFr900.) Over in the Marais, the Pavillon de la Reine is based in the stunning 17th century setting of the Place des Vosges. The building is a lovely hotel particulier, with a pretty flower-filled garden, although the interior design does verge on Disneyesque gothic, with mock-Medieval bedsteads and chunks of tree trunks for key-rings. But this is still the only hotel in Paris where you can munch your morning croissants among the arches of Place des Vosges. (Pavillon de la Reine, tel. 4277 9640. Rooms from FFr1,250). If you want something cheaper, but charming, you could choose one of the tiny hotels on the islands or the back streets of Saint Germain. Hotel des Deux Iles is set in a pretty 17th century building on the Ile Saint-Louis, a short walk away from the Seine. The nearby Jeu de Paume also offers small, simple rooms at similar prices. (Hotel des Deux Iles, tel. 4326 1335. Rooms from FFr650. Jeu de Paume, tel. 4326 1418. Rooms from FFr730.) Saint Germain is another good source of picturesque hotels particularly on the streets along the Seine, Rue Jacob and Rue de l'Universite. The Lenox on Rue de l'Universite is one of the most popular with basic rooms, but a stunning Art Deco bar tucked away on the ground floor which is a favourite haunt of the Paris publishing crowd as well as the hotel guests. (Hotel Lenox, tel. 4296 1095. Rooms from FFr550.) Wherever you decide to stay make sure you book early. Paris is usually packed with business travellers and tourists throughout the year. Sometimes the city is so busy that it is almost impossible to find a room anywhere. The worst times of all are late March and mid-October when the fashion crowd takes over for the pret a porter collections and mid-June, when the aerospace industry arrives for the Paris Air Show. May, June, September and October are the busiest times for the tourist trade. During these months the Parisian hotels are packed to capacity and the sightseeing centres around Notre Dame and the Eiffel Tower, often seem more like downtown Detroit or Tokyo than part of France's capital city. Virtually the only time of year when you are almost sure to get a room anywhere you want at reasonably short notice is August, when business life grinds to a halt, Parisians flee to the coast or country for their vacances leaving the city's shops and restaurants to drag down their shutters for la fermeture annuelle. But no-one with any sense chooses to come to Paris in August anyway.</p>

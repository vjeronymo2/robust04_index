			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: PRODUCTS THAT MAKE GOOD GIFTS  </P> <P> Need a last-minute Christmas gift or a New Year's present for yourself? Here  are some of my favorites:  </P> <P> The first is ideal for anyone who must sit through long meetings while  colleagues drone on. Sound familiar? If so, your organization is wasting time  and money.  </P> <P> To find out how much, turn on the Meeting Meter, a $29.95 program that's like a  taxi meter for meetings. The program allows you to enter the names and hourly  costs for up to 80 participants. You can also enter the cost of the meeting  room and other facilities.  </P> <P> The display, which looks like a taxi meter, keeps a running total of the  meeting's actual cost. It might make the perfect gift for your boss or for a  colleague in need of a not-so-subtle hint. It was created by Bernard DeKoven,  whose Institute for Better Meetings helps companies use technology to enhance  communications.  </P> <P> The IBM PC version is memory-resident, so it can be displayed even when other  programs are running. The Macintosh version runs under Apple's HyperCard  programming environment.  </P> <P> Meeting Meter can be ordered from the Institute for Better Meetings in Palo  Alto. Phone: (800) 729-1757 or (415) 857-1757. Fax: (415) 493-1417.  </P> <P> My second choice -- actually two choices -- will help you maintain your  schedule and keep track of your friends and business associates. And you don't  need a computer to use it.  </P> <P> The choices are two new versions of Sharp's Wizard handheld electronic  organizer. I disliked the original Sharp Wizard because its keyboard, laid out  in an "ABCD" fashion, was almost impossible for me to use. A lot of people  complained and Sharp listened. The new models have the traditional "QWERTY"  keyboards that are a lot easier to use if you know your way around a computer  or typewriter.  </P> <P> The new models still fit in a coat pocket but are a bit larger than their  predecessor. Both weigh 10.2 ounces and measure 7.1 by 3.8 by 0.7 inches. In  addition to being larger, the keyboard is now horizontally positioned so that  you actually have some room to press keys. It's by no means a full-sized  keyboard, but at least you can find your way around.  </P> <P> The two new models are identical except for their memory capacity and price.  The Wizard OZ 8200 has a suggested retail price of $399.95 and comes with 128  kilobytes of memory -- enough to store nearly 2,600 names and phone numbers or  more than 1,800 appointments. The other model, OZ 8000, has 64 kilobytes of  memory and costs $359.95. The built-in functions of both models include a  monthly, weekly and daily calendar, along with a memo pad, address and phone  directory, business card directory, outliner and calculator.  </P> <P> The Wizard is not classified as a computer, but that's a matter of semantics.  It is programmable and can run optional software from Sharp and other  companies. It doesn't have a tiny little disk drive, but it does have a slot  for credit-card-size integrated circuit cards. Optional cards from Sharp  include a money planner, a scientific card, a language translator, a time and  expense card, a Spanish/English card and a spreadsheet. Card prices range from  $79.99 to $129.99.  </P> <P> The Wizard comes with built-in communications software so that it can be used  with a modem to access electronic on-line services such as CompuServe and MCI  Mail. Sharp also plans to introduce a modem and integrated circuit card for  outgoing faxes. The company also is developing game cards, including Box  Jockey, Tetris and chess. Also, you can opt for a golf scoring card or a Bible  on a card.  </P> <P> Sharp offers software to link the Wizard to a PC or Macintosh but will soon  introduce a new linking program for MS-DOS, with enhanced searching, printing  and indexing capabilities. It also has a converter for Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet  files and calendar and address data from Sidekick 2.0, the yet-to-be-released  new version of Borland International's popular personal information management  software.  </P> <P> For more information or the name of a dealer, call Sharp at (800) 321-8877.  </P> <P> My third choice will come in handy for anyone who needs to upgrade or maintain  a PC. "The PC Configuration Handbook: A Complete Guide to Troubleshooting,  Enhancing and Maintaining Your PC" by John Woram answers questions that are  almost never covered in basic manuals. Its 700 pages are full of technical  data, but the book is surprisingly easy to understand, even for the beginner.  </P> <P> I wouldn't make it required reading for every new PC user, but I recommend it  to those who want to get under the hood of their PC. The just-revised second  edition (Bantam Computer Books, $26.95) covers every type of PC -- through  those using Intel's 486 microprocessor -- and each version of MS-DOS, including  5.0.  </P> <P> One additional gift idea that doesn't have any bugs -- but might cause  cavities: The Original Chocolate Byte and the Original Chocolate Computer,  starting at $10.95, are compatible with anyone who has a sweet tooth and a  sense of humor. Call (800) 332-BYTE.  </P> <P> Happy holidays.  </P> <P> Computer File welcomes readers' comments but regrets that the authors cannot  respond individually to letters. Write to Lawrence J. Magid, P.O. Box 620477,  Woodside, Calif. 94062, or contact the L. Magid account on the MCI electronic  mail system.  </P></p>

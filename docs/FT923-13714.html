			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Arts: Soft-centre Giselle - Australian Ballet's staging The central role is the reason for the survival of Giselle. Even under the most inimical circumstances - that creaking tent, echoing with exterior noise, in which the Royal Ballet used to camp out in Battersea  - a great interpretation will tell us everything about this romantic icon, as we recall from a celebrated and be-canvassed matinee with Makarova and Dowell. Careful opera-house stagings, hung about with every period knick-knack that producer's mania can conceive, are of no avail without the focus of a commanding ballerina. Youth, innocent willingness, mean little in dancing Giselle: the justification for any performance in this 'holy ballet', as Karsavina called it, is an apostolic succession - the handing on of nuance and understanding from great ballerinas to their heirs. The Australian Ballet showed their Giselle on Thursday night. It is a sensitive, unfussed and traditional recension by Maina Gielgud. It has felicitous touches: the appearance of the wilis, born of the nocturnal mists, is redolent of romantic feeling, and nicely menacing. The supporting playing is discreet, well-mannered, and in Josef Christianson we saw a fine Hilarion, credible in his feelings for Giselle as in his terrors amid the menacing wilis. But, like so many others, the staging is waiting for the transforming presence of a great central interpretation to make us part of its world, rather than mere observers of its quaint charms. Fiona Tonkin and Steven Heathcote, the Giselle and Albrecht of this first performance, were conscientious in all things. She was by turns shy and adoring as the village maiden; he was loving, then remorseful. And the ballet looked like an exercise rather than a masterpiece. In the spectral frenzies of the forest scene - where Maina Gielgud's production is at its best - both artists showed us that this was a poetic drama rather than the prosaic tale that had been Act 1. The gauzy horde of the wilis was admirable, united in style and step; Sian Stokes, a commanding Myrtha, and Lisa Bolte and Robyn Corby, her lieutenants, were vaporously excellent. Peter Farmer's design goes through all the right motions, and sustains the narrative. As a curtain-raiser (and it is good to have another ballet with Giselle: today's ticket prices entitle audiences to as much dancing as they can get), we were given Catalyst by young Australian choreographer Stephen Baynes. He has turned to the Poulenc two-piano concerto, a work in which he discerns 'a sense of conflict'. In seeking to prove this theory in dance, it seems to me that Mr Baynes has set dogmatic limits on his response to the score. He treats it as a case to be proved, rather than as music which might feed his evident ability to make plotless classical movement. His cast work very well, with Greg Horsman especially brilliant. There is an inexplicable design of ropes and what looks like a bronze-age chandelier. The soloists in the concerto - Nigel Gaynor and Stuart Macklin - were excellent. Thurday's performance was dedicated to the memory of the outstanding Australian premier danseur and teacher, Kelvin Coe, whose death at the age of 45 was reported that morning. Coe was a magnificent dancer and his passing must grieve everyone who saw this sincere, generous and exhilarating artist. The Australian ballet season continues at the Coliseum with varied programming until 18 July.</p>

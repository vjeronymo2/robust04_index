			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Ukraine agrees to removal of nuclear missiles: 'Hopeful and historic' deal to go before Kiev parliament in the spring The US, Russia and Ukraine have reached agreement on the removal of all former Soviet nuclear missiles from Ukrainian territory, President Bill Clinton announced last night. The US president will stop briefly in Kiev tomorrow night to talk to President Leonid Kravchuk, who will then join Mr Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow on Friday to initial the agreement. An ebullient Mr Clinton described the settlement as 'hopeful and historic' and, along with the Nato summit's endorsement yesterday of closer co-operation with former Warsaw Pact nations, as 'two breakthroughs for peace'. He was speaking in Brussels at the end of the first day of a summit otherwise overshadowed by the conflict in former Yugoslavia, over which Mr Clinton warned European allies yesterday that Nato must be ready to carry out threats of military action or risk the credibility of the alliance. On the Ukraine missiles deal, the president was confident that Mr Kravchuk could carry the Ukrainian parliament with him, but this remains a big stumbling block. Last year the legislature added sufficient conditions and demands to an earlier agreement to render it unacceptable to the US. Mr Kravchuk will submit this agreement, together with the Start and Nuclear non-proliferation treaties already approved, to the new parliament after elections in March. The deal, if agreed there, would remove one of the largest sources of potential instability in the former Soviet Union. However, in Kiev last night officials urged caution, suggesting that the final terms of the accord had yet to be determined. Mr Kravchuk has a history of appearing to agree on key issues with Russia, then revising the terms of the agreement later. Relations between Ukraine and Russia worsened last year after an agreement in principle on the handing over to Russia of the Black Sea Fleet was later repudiated by Mr Kravchuk. Both Mr Clinton and Mr Warren Christopher, his secretary of state, argued that Ukraine would benefit from the missiles agreement - not only in the form of financial payments from the US, but also because its territorial integrity had now been guaranteed by the US and Russia, its powerful neighbour. The agreement enables Mr Clinton to claim a substantial foreign policy victory in a field - nuclear non-proliferation - to which he has accorded high priority. Kazakhstan and Belarus, the other two former Soviet republics with nuclear missiles, have already given them up. US officials said the 'framework' agreement to deactivate nearly 1,800 warheads and 175 intercontinental ballistic missiles now based in Ukraine - all aimed at the US - could see the first transfers of warheads to Russia begin in the spring. The process is expected to take seven years. Ukraine will receive 'somewhat more' than the Dollars 175m (Pounds 118m) already on offer from the Nunn-Lugar programme which helps states dismantle their nuclear capabilities. Additionally the US will buy enriched uranium extracted from the missiles under the existing Dollars 12bn, 20-year understanding with Russia. It will then be reprocessed and resold on a commercial basis.

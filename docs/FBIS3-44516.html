But the fact that the bilateral discussions were held here  for the first time did provide local citizens with a personal  opportunity to find how unrealistic the communist-held mainland  is in dealing with Taiwan.    This personal finding should go a long way toward building a  consensus over the government's mainland policies. Many  businessmen, politicians and a lot of members in the general  public in the past have consistently criticized the government  for being too slow in improving relations with the mainland.    It is not the government that does not want to normalize  relations with Beijing. In fact, Taipei has always been trying  to do that. The problem is that Beijing has stubbornly refused  to recognize this government and to respect its jurisdiction  over Taiwan.    It is this unreasonable stance of Beijing that once again  prevented the solution of the three thorny issues in the Taipei  round of bilateral talks. This Beijing position was expressed  by its negotiators throughout the five-day discussions.    For example, the Beijing negotiators contended that the  entry  of mainland people into Taiwan can be viewed as illegal only  when they also break relevant regulation of the mainland. Why  Beijing has such a view is apparently because it thinks Taiwan  is a province of Mainland China and thus its people travel to  this island does not constitute a crime of illegal entry.    This is ridiculous. If Beijing continues to stick to its  unrealistic Taiwan policies and ignores the fact that Taiwan and  the mainland are politically divided and that this island has  its own legitimate government and independent judicial system,  there will never be a day for the two sides to normalize  relations.    Despite the failure to reach any agreement in the latest  round of talks, local negotiators should be lauded for their  firm position on protecting Taiwan's jurisdiction and  sovereignty. To yield on this most important matter means to  acquiesce in communist rule.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii) Offsets which are obtained pursuant to paragraphs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section and pursuant to permitting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions in a district other than that in which the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source is located may be used only if the EPA has reviewed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit conditions issued by the other district in which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed offsets are obtained and certifies that the impacts of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using such offsets meet the requirements of all applicable rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and regulations. Emission reduction credits used to offset  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project emissions in another district shall be implemented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through an interdistrict agreement to ensure their enforceability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and permanence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Applicants providing internal offsets for major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifications at major sources of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or ROCs must provide them  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at a 1.3 to 1 offset ratio.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Offsets which are achieved from mobile emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction credits shall be subject to an offset ratio of 2.0 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.0.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Emission reductions, shutdowns, and curtailments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Actual emission reductions from a shutdown or curtailment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permitted emission units may be credited for the purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> banking and offsets pursuant to &sect;52.3002, Emissions Reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Credit Authorization, provided:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Application is made for emission reduction credits; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The crediting and disbursement of emission reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from source shutdowns and curtailments are in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most current EPA emissions trading policy and applicable federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Emissions decreases are ensured and documented by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforceable emission limitations contained in the Authority to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Construct; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Emissions decreases are ensured by the permanent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surrender or cancellation of the Authority to Construct.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ambient air quality standards. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In no case shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from the new or modified stationary source prevent or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interfere with the attainment or maintenance of any applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ambient air quality standard. The EPA may require the use of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air quality model to estimate the effects of a new or modified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stationary source. The analysis shall estimate the effects of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new or modified stationary source, and verify that the new or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modified stationary source will not prevent or interfere with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment or maintenance of any ambient air quality standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In making this determination, the EPA shall take into account the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mitigation of emissions through offsets pursuant to this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the impacts of transported pollutants on downwind pollutant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations. The EPA may impose, based on an air quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis, offset ratios greater than the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (c)(3) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Denial, failure to meet standards. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The EPA shall deny  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any Authority to Construct if the EPA finds that the subject of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the application would not comply with the standards set forth in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federal rules or regulations. Stationary sources and emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units are required to curtail operations corresponding to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extent that required offsets are not obtained, or are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permanently maintainable. The owner or operator of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stationary source or emissions unit requiring offsets has the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ultimate responsibility for ensuring that offsets are real,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surplus, permanent, and quantifiable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Alternative siting analysis. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  By means of an analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of alternative sites, sizes, production processes, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental control techniques for a new or modified stationary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source, the owner or operator of the proposed stationary source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or modification shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the benefits of the proposed source significantly outweigh  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the environmental and social costs incurred as a result of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> location, construction, or modification. Whenever any proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source or modification is subject to action by a state or federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency that might necessitate the preparation of an environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact statement, which includes an alternative siting analysis,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the EPA may accept the alternative sitings analysis prepared  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to that action to meet this requirement to the extent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Administrative requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative requirements shall apply to any activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated by this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Complete application. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The EPA shall determine whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the application is complete no later than 30 days after receipt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the application, or after such longer time period that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant and the EPA have agreed to in writing. If the EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines that the application is not complete, the applicant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be notified in writing of the decision specifying the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information required. Upon receipt of any re-submittal of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application, a new 30-day period to determine completeness shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> begin. Completeness of an application or a re-submitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application shall be evaluated on the basis of the information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements set forth in 40 CFR 70.5(c), Federal Operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Permit Program and the information required by this section. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA may, at any time during the processing of the application,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request an applicant to clarify, amplify, correct, or otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplement the information submitted in the application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Air quality models. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  All air quality models used for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the purposes of this section shall be consistent with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements provided in the most recent edition of the EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Guidelines on Air Quality Models, OAQPS 1.2&hyph;080,'' unless the EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finds that such model is inappropriate for use. After making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such a finding, the EPA may designate an alternate model only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after allowing for public comment. Credit shall not be given for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stacks higher than dictated by good engineering practice. All  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modeling costs associated with the siting of a stationary source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be borne by the applicant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Preliminary decision. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Except as provided in paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(2) of this section, following acceptance of an application as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete, the EPA shall perform the evaluations required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine compliance with all applicable requirements of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section and make a preliminary written decision as to whether an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Authority to Construct should be approved, conditionally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved, or denied. The decision shall be supported by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> succinct written analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Publication, public comment, and requests for public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearings. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section, within 10 calendar days following a preliminary decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the EPA shall publish,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in at least one newspaper of general circulation in the district,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a notice stating the preliminary decision of the EPA noting how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the pertinent information can be obtained, and inviting written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public comment for a 30-day period following the date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication. The notice shall also provide that any interested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person may submit a written request for a public hearing, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that such request must include a statement of the issues proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be raised in the hearing. If a written request for a public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing is received during the public comment period, the EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall use the procedures given at 40 CFR 124.12, Public Hearings,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable to PSD permits, to grant or deny the request and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hold a public hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

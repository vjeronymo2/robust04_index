			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Majid Reza'iyan: "Why This Indifference?"] </F>   [Text] Public opinion is often described as an obscure  political power and is considered to be one of the major pillars  of national strength. In the area of public opinion the press  plays an important role and, generally speaking, its efforts are  summed up as either "positive" or "negative."    The press in Iran today is facing extremely sensitive  conditions that inevitably call for the adoption of a clear  stance and firm guidance of public opinion.    Actually, why are some of our press today indifferent toward  a reality that is known as cultural onslaught? What impact does  this indifference have on the current generation and will it  have on the coming generation?    The esteemed leader, His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, who  has repeatedly stressed the dangers of a foreign cultural  onslaught and has warned against weakness toward this onslaught,  said when appointing the new KEYHAN editor that "indifference  toward the Iranian nation's mental needs and its Islamic and  revolutionary aspirations, which can be seen in some of the  country's press today, is a sin that will not be pardoned by our  people now or in the future or on the day of divine judgment."    Yes! Some of the newspapers in Iran today consider the  publication of the ideas of those who do not believe in the  Islamic and national grandeur of the people to be better than  confronting such ideas. Some newspapers prefer to propagate  secular beliefs within the framework of each interview and  roundtable discussion that they publish rather than propound the  luminous ideas of Islam and of the revolution.    Where should we seek the root of such indifference? Where  does this indifference, conservatism, and disregard for reality  and values come from?    It seems that some of the foreign cultural onslaught happens  not because it is strong but because our own forces are not firm  in stating their views.    What answer do those who manage most of the press,  especially  the newspapers, in Iran today and should meet the mental needs  of the Iranian nation, the young generation, and the truth  seekers have for this indifference?    How successful have some newspapers with a high circulation  that publish long interviews and propound the "theory of  forbearance" or publish items trying to encourage the country's  foreign policy to establish relations with the United States  been in their main mission, which is to guide public opinion,  clarify reality, and defend the country from the foreign  onslaught? Especially at a time when the ideological and  cultural trends of heterodox elements are exploiting the freedom  of the press in Iran today and are constantly putting forth  pro-Western theories. Of course, it is because of the  prevailing indifference that such situations are not confronted.  The esteemed leader said in his statement appointing the new  KEYHAN editor:    "The confrontation and rebellion against aspirations that  can  unfortunately be seen in some newspapers today because of the  exploitation of the freedoms that the Islamic Republic enjoys is  a heavy and unforgettable sin."    Thus, with the clear stances by the leader of the  revolution,  there is no place for pretexts. The forces that consider  themselves pious and committed to the revolution and to its  values and who rely on how some of the newspapers guide public  opinion do not have any justification for the continuation of  this indifference.</p>

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Sailing: Spending millions on espionage THE 'S-words' are on everyone's lips in San Diego. Spying and spending are the live issues as America's Cup XXVIII reaches the half-way point. Intelligence-gathering against rival teams has reached the point where the US Coastguard has begun to bang syndicate heads together. Local commander Al Boty called a summit to warn the yachtsmen that ramming and barging between tenders and chase boats had become so dangerous that the USCG would not hesitate to intervene. At one point, the Japanese tender crashed between the spy boat Gazzini and the Nippon yacht when the former came within 15 metres. The Gazzini has blackened windows and the crew are never seen on deck. It is chartered to Bill Koch, owner/skipper of the America3 defence campaign. Koch admits openly that the vessel is the intelligence arm of his four-boat, Dollars 60m (Pounds 34m) attempt to keep the cup in America. Indeed, many of his 200 employees are research scientists. It is accepted that the Gazzini fires a laser and range-finder at 'target' yachts to measure performance. This data is then 'raced' within a computer against the known performance of the America3 yachts - the hi-tech equivalent of watching your opponent train. Where the matter becomes contentious, though, is the allegations that the Gazzini is using a Star Wars technique known as 'tempesting' to capture data off the on-board computers of rival yachts. In the last years of the Cold War, western agencies such as the NSA and GCHQ certainly had such techniques, and they were deployed in the Gulf War. 'Data screens use impulses to form print-outs,' said Bill Trenkle, operations manager for Dennis Conner's team, Stars &amp; Stripes. 'There is firm speculation that America3 have instruments to read your screen on one of their own.' Conner is battling Koch, with little success, for the right to be the cup defender. Modifications to Stars &amp; Stripes proved so disastrous that Conner had to ask Koch's permission for extra lay-days to put the yacht back to its previous rig and keel set-up. The white-haired Koch and his sailing mentor, Buddy Melges, have developed a fine double act at their rival's expense. One duet at a recent news conference ran thus. Koch: 'Our philosophy is not to grind Dennis's nose into the mud and pound on him.' Melges: 'Isn't it?' Koch: 'Our purpose is to have the best possible racing in the trials and go on to win the America's Cup.' Melges: 'Then go grind his nose in the mud.' Among the eight challengers, a clear Division I and II have emerged after two round-robins. Barring divine intervention New Zealand, France, Italy and Japan will make the semi-finals and Australia (two teams), Sweden and Spain will not. The linking factor is that the first four have built at least three yachts and spent a minimum of Dollars 30m each, while the losers have only a single boat and minimal budgets. Now, the Italian Il Moro di Venezia group (five yachts and a dollar spend of close to nine figures) has upped the ante still further with a revolutionary sail development. Carbon-fibre sails were the breakthrough unveiled by Il Moro for the third challenger round-robin starting today. Skipper Paul Cayard says they are stronger and lighter than the Kevlar weaves now in use. In order to maintain maximum secrecy, Il Moro has been testing the new sails at dawn and dusk over 20 miles offshore. If they work, the extra strength should reduce distortion as the sail wears, while extra lightness aloft reduces the boat's inertia and improves performance in choppy conditions. 'It's the most important innovation in sail-making since Kevlar replaced Dacron over 10 years ago,' says Cayard. No such breakthrough stays unmatched for long, though. Koch's sail designers have announced their own version of an ultra-light new fabric, consisting of long-chain polymers. Koch, a scientist by training, says the molecular structure is unique in terms of aligning itself to the stresses within the sails. The material was used for the first time in a race on Thursday. The Il Moro team has already spent around Dollars 60m (with more to come), built five yachts (more than any other challenger in the cup's 141-year-history), and showed that it has no fear of a cheque-book race. Nevertheless, Raul Gardini, its head, is advocating a pan-European defence should either the Italians or French win the cup from the San Diego Yacht Club in May. Interestingly, Il Moro races under the EC flag rather than the Italian tricolour. It remains to be seen if this is a portent or merely a signal of Gardini's pique at being deposed from the chairmanship of the Ferruzzi group last summer. Anyway, before the cup can become the subject of any kind of Brussels committee meeting, the New Zealanders must be deposed from the head of the challenger table, where they sit five points clear of Italy.</p>

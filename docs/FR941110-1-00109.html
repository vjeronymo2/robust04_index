			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (I) The amount of unexpended allowances or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorizations of the type and for the control period being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> converted that the convertor holds under authority of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart as of the date the claim is submitted to EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The Administrator will determine whether the records  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained by EPA, taking into account any previous conversions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any transfers, and any production, imports (not including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transshipments, or used controlled substances), or exports (not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including transshipments, or used controlled substances) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances reported by the convertor, indicate that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the convertor possesses, as of the date the conversion claim is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processed, unexpended allowances sufficient to cover the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversion claim (i.e., the amount to be converted plus, in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case of conversions of production or consumption allowances, one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of that amount). Within three working days of receiving a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete conversion claim, the Administrator will take action to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notify the convertor as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) If EPA's records show that the convertor has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient unexpended allowances to cover the conversion claim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Administrator will issue a notice indicating that EPA does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not object to the conversion and will reduce the convertor's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> balance of unexpended allowances by the amount to be converted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plus, in the case of conversions of production or consumption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowances, one percent of that amount. When EPA issues a no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objection notice, the convertor may proceed with the conversion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, if EPA ultimately finds that the convertor did not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient unexpended allowances to cover the claim, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> convertor will be held liable for any violations of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations of this subpart that occur as a result of, or in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conjunction with, the improper conversion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) If EPA's records show that the convertor has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insufficient unexpended allowances to cover the conversion claim,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or that the convertor has failed to respond to one or more Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests to supply information needed to make a determination,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Administrator will issue a notice disallowing the conversion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Within 10 working days after receipt of notification, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> convertor may file a notice of appeal, with supporting reasons,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the Administrator. The Administrator may affirm or vacate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the disallowance. If no appeal is taken by the tenth working day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after notification, the disallowance shall be final on that day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) In the event that the Administrator does not respond to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a conversion claim within the three working days specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the convertor may proceed with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the conversion. EPA will reduce the convertor's balance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unexpended allowances by the amount to be converted plus, in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case of conversions of production or consumption allowances, one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of that amount. However, if EPA ultimately finds that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> convertor did not have sufficient unexpended allowances to cover  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the claims, the convertor will be held liable for any violations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the regulations of this subpart that occur as a result of, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in conjunction with, the improper conversion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Effective January 1, 1995, any person (``convertor'') may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> convert Article 5 allowances for one class I controlled substance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the same type of allowance for another class I controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance within the same Group of controlled substances as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first, as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The convertor must submit to the Administrator a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversion claim setting forth the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The identity and address of the convertor;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The name and telephone number of a contact person for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> convertor;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The type of Article 5 allowances being converted,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including the names of the controlled substances for which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowances are to be converted;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) The group of controlled substances to which the Article 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowances being converted pertains;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) The amount and type of allowances to be converted;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (F) The amount of allowances to be subtracted from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> convertor's unexpended allowances for the first controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance, to be equal to 101 percent of the amount of allowances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> converted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (G) The amount of Article 5 allowances to be added to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> convertor's unexpended allowances for the second controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance, to be equal to the amount of allowances for the first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substance being converted multiplied by the quotient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the ozone depletion factor of the first controlled substance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> divided by the ozone depletion factor of the second controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance, as listed in Appendix A to this subpart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (H) The control period(s) for which the Article 5 allowances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are being converted; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (I) The amount of unexpended Article 5 allowances for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control period being converted that the convertor holds under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority of this subpart as of the date the claim is submitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The Administrator will determine whether the records  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained by EPA, taking into account any previous conversions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any transfers, and any production, or exports of controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances reported by the convertor, indicate that the convertor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possesses, as of the date the conversion claim is processed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unexpended Article 5 allowances sufficient to cover the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversion claim. Within three working days of receiving a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete conversion claim, the Administrator will take action to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notify the convertor as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) If EPA's records show that the convertor has sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unexpended Article 5 allowances to cover the conversion claim the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator will issue a notice indicating that EPA does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> object to the conversion and will reduce the convertor's balance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of unexpended allowances by the amount to be converted. When EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues a no objection notice, the convertor may proceed with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversion.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Bid Bond. Each Proposal must be accompanied by a Bid Bond in the form attached or a certified check on a bank that is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, payable to the order of the Owner, in an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the maximum bid price. Each Bidder agrees, provided its Proposal is one of the three low Proposals, that, by filing its Proposal together with such Bid Bond or check in consideration of the Owner's receiving and considering such Proposal, said Proposal shall be firm and binding upon each such Bidder and such Bid Bond or check shall be held by the Owner until a Proposal is accepted and a satisfactory Contractor's Bond is furnished (where required) by the successful Bidder and such acceptance has been approved by the Administrator, or for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days from the date hereinbefore set for the opening of Proposals, whichever period shall be the shorter. If such Proposal is not one of the three low Proposals, the Bid Bond or check will be returned in each instance within a period of ten (10) days to the Bidder furnishing same.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Contractor's Bond. The successful Bidder will be required to execute two additional counterparts of the Proposal and, for a Contract in excess of $100,000, to furnish a Contractor's Bond in triplicate in the form attached hereto with sureties listed by the United States Treasury Department as Acceptable Sureties in a penal sum not less than the Contract price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Failure to Furnish Contractor's Bond. Should the successful Bidder fail or refuse to execute such counterparts of the Proposal or to furnish a Contractor's Bond (where required) within ten (10) days after written notification of the acceptance of the Proposal by the Owner, the Bidder will be considered to have abandoned the Proposal. In such event, the Owner shall be entitled (a) to enforce the Bid Bond in accordance with its terms, or (b) if a certified check has been delivered with the Proposal, to retain from the proceeds of the certified check the difference (not exceeding the amount of the certified check) between the amount of the Proposal and such larger amount for which the Owner may in good faith contract with another party to construct the Project. The term ``successful Bidder'' shall be deemed to include any Bidder whose proposal is accepted after another Bidder has previously refused or has been unable to execute the counterparts of the proposal or to furnish a satisfactory Contractor's Bond (where required.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Factors in Deciding the Award of the Contract. In estimating the lowest cost to the Owner as one of the factors in deciding the award of the Contract, the Owner will consider, in addition to the prices quoted in the Proposals, the following:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Contract is Entire Agreement. The Contract to be effected by the acceptance of the Proposal shall be deemed to include the entire agreement between the parties thereto, and the Bidder shall not claim any modification thereof resulting from any representation or promise made at any time by any officer, agent or employee of the Owner or by any other person.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Minor Irregularities. The Owner reserves the right to waive minor irregularities or minor errors in any Proposal, if it appears to the Owner that such irregularities or errors were made through inadvertence. Any such irregularities or errors so waived must be corrected on the Proposal prior to the acceptance thereof by the Owner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Bid Rejection. The Owner reserves the right to reject any or all Proposals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. Definition of Terms. The terms ``Administrator'', ``Engineer'', ``Supervisor'', ``Project'', ``Completion of Construction'' and ``Completion of the Project,'' as used throughout this Contract, shall be as defined in Article VI, Section 1 of the Contractor's Proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. The Owner Represents:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) If by provisions of the Contractor's Proposal the Owner shall have undertaken to furnish any materials for the construction of the Project, such materials are on hand at locations specified or if such materials are not on hand they will be made available to the successful Bidder at the locations specified before the time such materials are required for construction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) All funds necessary for prompt payment for the construction of the Project will be available. If the Owner shall fail to comply with any of the undertakings contained in the foregoing representations or if any of such representations shall be incorrect, the Bidder will be entitled to an extension of time of completion for a period equal to the delay, if any, caused by the failure of the Owner to comply with such undertakings or by any such incorrect representations, provided the Bidder shall have promptly notified the Owner in writing of its desire to extend the time of completion, and provided, further, that such extension, if any, of the time of the completion shall be the sole remedy of the Bidder for the Owner's failure, because of conditions beyond the control and without the fault of the Owner, to furnish materials in accordance with subparagraph a, hereof. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->  Owner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> , 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Contractor's Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> To Furnish, Deliver and Install Equipment and Materials TO:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  (hereinafter called the ``Owner'')  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> ARTICLE I_GENERAL  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.

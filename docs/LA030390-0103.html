			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MAN SHOT BY DEPUTY GETS $510,000  </P> <P> A jury awarded $510,000 Friday to a former tow truck driver from Sylmar who was  shot and critically wounded in an altercation with an off-duty Los Angeles  County sheriff's deputy who chased the tow truck after he saw it collide with a  car and fail to stop.  </P> <P> The judgment, announced in San Fernando Superior Court after six days of  deliberation, was reduced from $850,000 because jurors determined that the tow  truck driver -- John Gibbons, 24, of Sylmar -- was partly responsible. Jurors  ordered Los Angeles County and the deputy, David Rawson, each to pay Gibbons  $255,000, said Gibbons' attorney, Richard E. Eldred.  </P> <P> An attorney who represented the deputy and the county could not be reached for  comment Friday evening.  </P> <P> The December, 1984, shooting in Sylmar left Gibbons without his spleen and left  kidney, requiring him to take antibiotics for the rest of his life to fight  infections, Eldred said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles police said after the shooting that Rawson chased Gibbons after  seeing him flee the scene of a minor accident at the northbound Polk Street  off-ramp of the Foothill Freeway. Police were unable to locate the driver of  the second vehicle involved in the accident.  </P> <P> Police said Gibbons stopped the truck on Foothill Boulevard, got out and walked  toward Rawson, who police said drew a .38-caliber revolver and identified  himself as a sheriff's deputy. Gibbons struggled with Rawson over the gun,  which discharged once, a Sheriff's Department spokesman said at the time.  </P> <P> But Eldred said that Gibbons did not try to grab the gun and that Rawson  identified himself as a sheriff's deputy only after the shooting.  </P> <P> Eldred said Rawson, who was assigned to the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho in  Castaic, should have called the California Highway Patrol to report the  accident instead of trying to chase the driver. Gibbons worked for a company  that had a towing contract with the CHP and could have been easily identified  by asking company officials who were working that evening, Eldred said.  </P></p>

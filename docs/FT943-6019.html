			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Unionists divided in degrees of scepticism The response by Northern Ireland's unionists to the IRA ceasefire will be crucial in determining how far the two governments can respond to it, consolidating it into what Dublin already believes is a permanent ceasefire. Initial unionist reactions have been ambivalent and sceptical. Mr Jim Wilson, general secretary of the Ulster Unionist party, said the IRA ceasefire did not meet the conditions of the Downing Street declaration and 'should not therefore trigger the process in which Sinn Fein could enter into exploratory talks with the British government'. Sitting across the negotiating table from Sinn Fein is 'way, way down the road', he said. If there is a permanent end to IRA violence though, and after exploratory talks between Sinn Fein and the British government, 'as a democratic party we would envisage a situation in which we would talk to other democratically elected parties'. Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the UUP, emerged from an hour-long meeting with prime minister John Major at Downing Street to say that he did not think the IRA's statement was sufficient to start the clock ticking in the lead-up to talks between London and Sinn Fein. 'I hope those who have influence with Sinn Fein/IRA will be able to take the next step and make it permanent,' Mr Molyneaux said. In a message to loyalist paramilitaries, Mr Molyneaux said there was 'no justification or excuse for violence on the part of anyone.' The hardline Democratic Unionist party has been predictably apocalyptic in its response. Mr Ian Paisley, the DUP leader, was earlier this week warning of a 'civil war' if the IRA ceasefire involved a deal with the British government. Mr Gregory Campbell, a DUP councillor from Derry, said: 'The IRA is replacing violence as a means of achieving its aims, with the threat of violence. Does anybody believe there has been no deal? We await with great interest what the British government has agreed to do in return.' The DUP remains steadfastly opposed to talks with Sinn Fein at any stage in the peace process, and has refused to enter round-table talks even with the other parties in the province unless the Downing Street declaration is rescinded. With the prospect of inclusive round-table talks still some way off, of immediate concern for the politicians and the security forces in Northern Ireland is whether there will be a backlash from the loyalist paramilitaries which could undermine the IRA ceasefire. The Combined Loyalist Military Command, the umbrella group for the two main protestant paramilitary groups, the UVF and the UFF, appears to be waiting to see what happens. In a statement yesterday it said: 'We will not be dancing to the Pan-nationalist tune,' and added: 'Is our constitution being tampered with or is it not? What deals have been done? End the speculation. No further comment will be forthcoming from the Combined Loyalist Military Command at present.' Perhaps the most encouraging signal that loyalist reaction may be restrained has come from Mr Hugh Smyth, Belfast's Lord Mayor, who is a member of the Progressive Unionist party, whose political base is in the loyalist Shankill Road area in Belfast and is considered close to the Ulster Volunteer Force. He welcomed yesterday's 'opportunity for peace' and urged the people of Northern Ireland to 'grasp this opportunity because history will not treat us kindly if we throw this opportunity away, providing that there is no sell-out. I believe we should all work now for peace, stability and political progress through reconciliation.' He described Republican aspirations for a united Ireland as 'legitimate' as long as they are not pursued by violent means. The key issue facing unionist leaders in the weeks ahead, therefore, will be whether they can bury their differences to confront what is now likely to emerge as a powerful nationalist alliance with agreed negotiating goals, between the mainly Catholic SDLP and Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland, backed by Fianna Fail and Labour in the government in the Republic. Failure to do so may well see a further erosion of unionist aspirations.</p>

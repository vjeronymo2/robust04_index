			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Kim Hyon-ik from the eastern central front line] </F>   [Text] Today, President Kim Yong-sam pointed out: "This is  a very dangerous time because North Korea may give rise to any  situation at any time," and stressed an attitude of vigilance  against North Korea.    President Kim, visiting an unidentified ROK Air Force  combat-  fighter corps this morning, was briefed on the status of the  corps. He said that "North Korea is in an extremely difficult  situation which we can hardly imagine," and asked officers and  men of the corps to assume a firm alert posture for an emergency.    President Kim revealed that "North Korea has suspended the  operation of many plants and closed them. Their number exceeds  what we had estimated. Besides, electric power is supplied to  farms only three hours a day. The voltage is so low that it is  difficult to watch television. Many soldiers are ill-fed due to  food shortages, and the unit composed of soldiers suffering  undernourishment is being managed separately."    President Kim also emphasized that "despite the shortage of  food and oil, North Korea is staging Air Force exercises  frequently and its flight training extended even to areas close  to the armistice line. Peace on the Korean peninsula can be  maintained only with our power, and if we fail to have it,  peace can never be maintained."    President Kim revealed that "about 15,000 North Korean  loggers are working in Russia, and 100 of them sought political  asylum at our embassy."    Following his visit to this combat fighter corps, President  Kim inspected a certain ROK Army division in the eastern front  line and the headquarters of a certain naval fleet.</p>

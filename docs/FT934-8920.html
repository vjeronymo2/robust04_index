			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Demand for silver outstrips supply DEMAND FOR physical silver has soared in the past week so that vaults in London cannot keep pace and there is a 14-day delay in processing deliveries. Much of the metal is on its way to India or Saudi Arabia. According to Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, Saudi buying surged recently because of fears that the local currency, the riyal, might be devalued. 'Silver is seen as a cheap hedge against devaluation,' he pointed out. 'And the Indians are almost gobbling silver up now that their domestic prices have fallen sharply,' he added. The Indian government's recent decision to ease some of the import restrictions on silver has seen the premium paid in India fall by about 14 per cent this year so that it is now only Dollars 1.50 an ounce above the international price compared with the peak of Dollars 8 it reached in 1990. 'The smugglers' loss has been the Indian consumer's gain,' he said. Mr Arnold suggested that the shortage of physical metal would be only temporary. 'The world is awash with silver,' he pointed out. He estimated that world silver stocks probably totalled more than 30,000 tonnes. 'Last year's silver supply deficit was about 385 tonnes, according to the Commodities Research Unit. So stocks could meet the deficit for no less than 82 years.' The Xerox Corporation's recent claim that it had discovered a silver-free film for use in the graphic arts sector of the photographic market was also bad news for silver producers, he said. If Xerox captured half this particular market it would be the equivalent of cutting consumption by 4 per cent. 'Prices of anything are made at the margin. A loss of 4 per cent consumption has to mean lower average silver prices, all things being equal.' Silver's price has recovered strongly since news of the Xerox discovery first hit the market two weeks ago at which time it dipped to Dollars 4.20 a troy ounce. Last night it closed in London at Dollars 4.545, down 3 cents. Eastman Kodak of the US said it will soon begin customer testing of a new prints-from-slides process using the digital PFX system. But an official said it would have no significant impact on silver usage.</p>

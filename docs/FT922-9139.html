			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Eximbank boost for Russian oil THE US Export-Import Bank said yesterday it would guarantee loans for two Russian companies to import Dollars 90m of US oil production equipment and planned to make total credits of up to Dollars 1bn available to Russia's oil sector, Reuter reports from Moscow. Mr Eugene Lawson, the US agency's vice-chairman, said Eximbank had agreed with Russia's foreign trade bank to provide Dollars 90m for Texas-based Lufkin Industries to supply two Russian enterprises. 'We can put serious money into this crucial area ..Anywhere from Dollars 500m to Dollars 1bn for starters,' he said. The agency's board decided last month that Russia was worthy of short and medium term credits and began doing business with it for the first time since breaking ties with Moscow in 1974. Mr Lawson said it had pinpointed the oil sector as an area where relatively low investment could make a huge difference in boosting foreign currency earnings. 'I'll be coming back in a month to see if we can sign an agreement that will allow us to put immediate credit into Russia,' Mr Lawson said. He said Russian oil output was crippled by lack of spare parts. The oil industry had the potential to boost Russian export earnings. In the longer term the agency, which provides guarantees for banks which finance US export deals, aims to help upgrade Russia's neglected oil pipelines, increase refining capacity and boost exploration.</p>

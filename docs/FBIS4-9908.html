			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jaime Flores from Tijuana, Baja California; from </F> the "ACIR Radio News" newscast -- live]    [Text] [Flores] I want to report that agents from the  Attorney General's Office [PGR] sent to Tijuana have started to  detain all of those who were part of Luis Donaldo Colosio's  security team for the 23 March event. Roberto Cardenas Sanchez  was detained at his business this morning. At about 1230, he  entered the PGR building in Tijuana.    His wife has gone to see Ramon Del Cid Valenzuela, commander  of the Federal Judicial Police [PJF] in Ensenada, to intercede  on his behalf. She says her husband had nothing to do with the  23 March events. She said they arrived at his place of business  early this morning and that her husband was detained by PGR  agents who took him to the PGR offices in Tijuana. It was  learned that five other people also were arrested today by PJF  agents for their alleged involvement in the Colosio case.    It has been learned that one of the arrested men is  (Humberto  Sanoja Morrel), a former state traffic and transportation  official in the (Xicoten Catleiva) government. Many of the  family members who are outside the PGR offices refuse to talk to  the press. It also has been learned that Miguel Angel Suarez was  removed from the State Judicial Police. His name also appears on  the list of people responsible for security at the 23 March  event. There are reports that Miguel Angel Suarez was drunk when  he was arrested, and, at the time of his arrest, he allegedly  was in possession of cocaine. Another man arrested is Genaro  Valle. Valle was head of the Playas de Tijuana delegation. Two  U.S. citizens accused him of extortion. In other words, arrests  are continuing in Tijuana. All of these arrests are connected  with the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio in Lomas Taurinas.    [Station announcer at Radio ACIR's Mexico City studios]  Thank  you for your report.    [Flores] Good evening.    [Station announcer] That is what is happening with the  current investigations into Colosio's assassination. There are  also rumors that some federal agencies are conducting unofficial  parallel investigations into this matter -- parallel to the  official investigations being conducted by the special assistant  prosecutor appointed by the president of the republic. These  parallel inquiries are reportedly being conducted at the request  and suggestion of Luis Donaldo Colosio's widow Diana Laura  Riojas.    If this is confirmed, it would be a serious matter.  Government Secretary Jorge Carpizo has been quoted as saying  that only one investigation will be conducted. Nevertheless, it  has been learned that some federal agencies, unidentified  federal agencies, have their own people in Tijuana investigating  the matter because their superiors want to have first-hand  information of what is going on. If this is true, they are  violating the pact to find the truth, a pact requested by the  president of the republic himself.</p>

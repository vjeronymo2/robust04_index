			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Professor Valeriy Korobeynikov, academician of </F> the International Academy of Computerization: "Don't Take  Offense at the Voter. He Is Always Right"]    [Text] How difficult is Russia finding it to become a  democratic state! This is what comes to mind when analyzing the  results of the elections to the local representative organs of  power. Failure by the bulk of citizens to appear at the polling  places, fairly frequent violations of electoral rights, and  flaws in the mechanisms for collaboration between the various  participants in the electoral process -- all this was not the  exception but the rule.    It is expedient to explore two routes simultaneously in the  quest for solutions to the problems which have arisen --  elaborating an integrated concept of the Russian electoral  system and analyzing constructively the practical experience  gained so far.    Unfortunately, the new Russian Constitution does not contain  a chapter on the electoral system which is traditionally in a  country's Fundamental Law. Constitutional norms concerning  elections are scattered among other chapters. This weakness is  to some extent compensated for by the presidential edict "On  Measures To Improve the Electoral System in the Russian  Federation." But even this document needs to be further  developed. A number of laws need to be elaborated and adopted,  such as a law on electing the president and deputies to the  State Duma, a law on referendums, and so on.    In order to improve the electoral system in Russia, it is  important to thoroughly consider both the negative and the  positive aspects of its practice. Quite a bit has already been  written about the negative aspects. I would like to concentrate  on the positive.    Let us take Stavropol Kray as an example. The results of the  voting speak for themselves. Some 39.76 percent of the voters  voted for candidates for deputies to the Stavropol Kray State  Duma in all the 25 electoral districts. The region's new  legislative organ was formed at the first attempt.    It cannot be said that the election campaign in Stavropol  Kray went off without any conflicts. On the contrary, there  were, for example, some tense moments over the kray duma's  numerical composition, the electoral districts' boundaries, and  the statute on the elections. In short, the degree of conflict  was fairly high. The voters' attitude during the run-up to the  elections was also typical of many of the country's regions.  Interest in the elections was lower than average. But  nevertheless, the negative aspects did not influence the final  result. Why?    This can, in my view, be attributed first and foremost to  the  flexible and active stance of the local executive branch of  power. The organizational measures for preparing and conducting  the elections were distinguished by their lack of orthodoxy.    Representatives of the executive organs of power also made a  contribution to boosting the voters' activeness. On the eve of  the elections, STAVROPOLSKAYA PRAVDA published an appeal by Kray  Administration Head Yevgeniy Kuznetsov to the voters. Calling  on citizens to come to the polling places, the administration  head appealed not only to their civic consciences but also to  their sense of thrift. After all, many millions of rubles had  been spent on organizing the elections in the kray, as,  incidentally, has been the case in other regions. The people  should know how to dispose of their property prudently.    Last but not least. Let us recall the days of voting in  pre-perestroyka times. For all their fundamental faults (lack  of choice, mandatory participation, and so on), their form was  attractive.    There is nothing to be ashamed about here. What is more, the  Russian electoral system will become genuinely democratic  precisely at the moment when elections become a responsible  demonstration of civic-mindedness, a real festival of people's  power.</p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Kurdish vote leads to show of unity: Political leaders bargained over post-election deals IRAQI KURDISTAN'S first free elections reached almost farcical levels even before the ballot papers were counted. It was never going to be perfect. There was no electoral register - hence the importance of marking-ink to prevent people voting more than once - because of the dislocation of Iraqi society. The Iran-Iraq war of 1980-88 was fought partly on Kurdish soil and culminated in the Iraqi government's use of chemical weapons against Peshmerga guerrillas and civilians. Thousands of villages were razed and perhaps as many as 180,000 civilians 'disappeared' in the late 1980s during a pogrom by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Then in 1991 thousands of Kurds fled to the mountains as Saddam regained strength after being driven out of Kuwait by the western allies. Against this backdrop, widows, orphans, refugee families and Kalashnikov-bearing guerrillas queued on May 19 to place their mark on ballot papers bearing the coloured flags of the Kurdish parties. Between the close of polling at midnight and the broadcast outcome on Friday, politicians bargained over post-election deals in return for accepting the propriety of the poll. Occasionally they called in judge Amier Hawesy, a stern-faced relic from the days of rule from Baghdad and now the 'neutral' head of the electoral commission. When he gave reporters the figures for seats in the new assembly, he was genuinely surprised to be asked for numbers of votes. The Kurds voted against Saddam and for peace. It was less important that Mr Massoud Barzani's Kurdistan Democatic party (KDP) was eventually put at 45.4 per cent and Mr Jalal Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) at 43.9 per cent in the assembly elections - or that Mr Barzani was ahead by a slightly larger margin in an election for president, which failed to achieve a definite outcome as no-one reached 50 per cent. The KDP forfeited a two-seat lead over the PUK, giving away one seat to its rival to make them level. The need for unity was greater than the desire for victory. Even the small parties, none of which reached the 7 per cent threshold for representation, would be included in the assembly's executive. Emerging arm-in-arm from the crucial summit at Shaklawa on Friday, Mr Barzani and Mr Talabani verged on the theatrical. But the ostensible political differences between the KDP's 'autonomy' and the PUK's 'self-determination with Iraq' were exaggerated for election purposes. There is a shared appreciation of the considerable problems facing the new administration created to fill the vacuum left by Mr Saddam's withdrawal from the region. Inflation has been rampant. A day's work in the fields is needed to buy a kilo of rice or a can of Turkish beer; two weeks' work will buy a pair of good shoes. While basic requirements filter through the UN embargo on Iraq and the Iraqi embargo on Kurdistan, there are widespread shortages. Saddam has a 100,000-strong army just south of Kurdish-held territory. The debris of burnt-out Iraqi heavy armour littering the road north of Salahuddin is evidence of guerrilla prowess with anti-tank weapons, but defence against helicopter gunships would rely on the allied air cover operating north of the 36th parallel from the Incerlik Nato base in south-east Turkey. An autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan is land-locked and without regional allies. The Kurdish leadership eagerly seizes on any hint that the US, Turkey or Iran are becoming more supportive. As the election fuels Kurdish aspirations in Turkey and Iran, KDP and PUK leaders are expected to attend next month's Vienna conference of the various Iraqi opposition groupings: this, they hope, will please the US.</p>

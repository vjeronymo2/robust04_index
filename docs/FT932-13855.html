			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hammerson falls Results as bad as feared, including a dividend cut, sent shares in Hammerson, the UK's fifth largest property group, tumbling 19 to 301p. The scale of the fall also represented speculators moving out of the stock as the depth of Hammerson's problems were thought to put paid to any potential bidder. Analysts expressed fears over the group's disposals strategy which aims to bring down the gearing level of 114 per cent, with some advocating a rights issue. 'The answer is not to sell quality assets at the worst possible time,' said Mr Graham Stanley at NatWest Securities, adding that a cash call would restore market faith in Hammerson's ability to turn the situation around. Hammerson's concerns pulled down the other leading property stocks. Land Securities receded 5 to 530p, MEPC 7 to 381p and British Land, often tipped as a Hammerson predator, 4 to 256p. The publication of two sets of US stakeholdings told a seemingly incongruous story yesterday. The US holding of British Petroleum shares officially topped 25 per cent for the first time and BP's UK share price slipped 1 1/2 to 302p. In contrast, the holding of American Depositary Receipts in Wellcome eased to 4.9 per cent and the UK share price jumped 32 to 734p. Some dealers were saying that US investors who have been responsible for driving the BP share price higher are finally beginning to be sated. On the other hand, there was a tentative feeling that US pessimism over the pharmaceuticals sector may have hit the bottom. A clutch of US first-quarter results on Monday were no better than in line with forecasts and yet share prices leaped sharply. Wellcome had been held back by a large line of stock washing around the market and saw a spectacular recovery. However, the other UK leaders also gained, Glaxo rising 17 to 580p while SmithKline Beecham, helped by well received first-quarter results, was lifted 12 to 444p. International drinks stocks were firm, with Allied-Lyons further buoyed by old talk that it would merge its Victoria Wine off-licence chain with Augustus Barnet, owned by Bass. A merger would create a business with sales of around Pounds 120m and have some commercial benefits, according to analysts. Allied surged 19 to 569p and Bass added 2 at 563p. Rank Organisation was the best performing leisure stock, dealers pointing out that the stock had been left behind in the recovery euphoria. Optimism was also being expressed that the group would be announcing a more positive trading picture when it meets with analysts next month. The shares gained 22 at 698p. Banks were stronger as the economic recovery story tightened its grip on the market's imagination. Barclays rose 13 to 427p, National Westminster climbed 11 to 472p and Standard Chartered, still responding to buying by BZW in a tight market, appreciated a further 17 to 740p. Recovery momentum sent building and construction shares sharply forward, making both sectors the best performers in the market. Among building materials groups, RMC Group surged 12 to 661p and Tarmac 7 to 140p. In contractors and construction, AMEC moved up 4 to 86p, Avonside Group 13 to 133p, Berkeley Group 6 to 402p, Bryant Group 6 to 136p and John Laing 14 to 252p. Stores also caught the mood, following on from the CBI distributive trades survey. WH Smith gained 10 at 432p, Kleinwort Benson among those said to be positive. Kingfisher rose 5 to 592p, BZW recommending the stock. Hoare Govett was aiding Dixons' rise, arguing that US trading fears had been overdone. The shares put on 13 at 211p. Confident presentations as part of a US roadshow helped Lasmo improve 5 to 151p. British Gas slipped 3 1/2 to 304 1/2 as one securities house voiced concern over the cost of the company's involvement in a Colombian project. Clyde Petroleum recovered 1 1/2 to 46 1/2 p as the rights issue was 93 per cent taken up. The rise of Mirror Group Newspapers continued as SG Warburg reiterated its strong buy recommendation, arguing that the company would be fairly valued when the shares hit 155p. Warburg believes that earnings per share will double to 10.9p and yet the company's prospective price/earnings ratio is at a discount to the market. Mirror Group added a penny at 138p. Advertising and marketing services concern WPP was firmer and heavily traded after a presentation by the company to analysts and institutions in the US on Monday. The shares closed 6 higher at 66p with turnover reaching 10m. Printing group St Ives retreated 6 to 337p after announcing that it had been held back by recession in the six months to end-January and that some of its markets had deteriorated. Speculation that MB-Caradon was about to hit the acquisition trail left the shares 8 off at 297p. English China Clays cut an earlier loss to finish a net 5 lighter at 434p, after James Capel weighed in with a profits downgrading. The agency broker is believed to have reduced its 1993 forecast by 11.7 per cent to Pounds 83m and the following year's figure by 8.2 per cent to Pounds 100m. In aerospace, SG Warburg published a cautious review on the sector in which it suggested that aircraft delivery in the years 1994 and 1995 will be between 10 and 15 per cent below its previous forecast. TI Group reacted to the report by initially falling 4 to 291p, but later benefited from the strong market trend and finished 4 ahead at 299p. Bargain hunters helped Smiths Industries advance 4 to 330p, ahead of today's interim figures. The shares have been one of the weak features in the aerospace sector, having underperformed the market by 16 per cent over the last three months. Strauss Turnbull expects profits to come in at Pounds 40m, against last year's Pounds 44m. Fears of greater competition from US carriers hurt British Airways shares, leaving them 2 off at 283p.</p>

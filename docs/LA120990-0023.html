			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HAVE YOURSELF A VERY VIDEO CHRISTMAS  </P> <P> If you want pictures with your Christmas music, there are plenty of videotapes  and discs available.  </P> <P> One of the most beautiful Yuletide music videos is Carols for Christmas, a  video filled with appropriately inspirational paintings from the Metropolitan  Museum of Art and an audio track filled with the Royal College of Music Chamber  Choir singing traditional carols conducted by Sir David Willocks.  </P> <P> The video's dramatic backdrop is St. Edmundsbury Cathedral. The program is  available on videotape (HBO, 60 minutes), but it is vastly superior on a  Pioneer Artists laser video disc. If you have a laser video machine, just play  this disc continuously.  </P> <P> Equally as stirring, but not as visually interesting is The New Born King, a  program of traditional carols from Westminster Cathedral (Video Arts  International tape). The singing is gorgeous- with baritone Benjamin Luxon,  Aled Jones (a boy soprano) and the Westminster Cathedral. The late actor Emlyn  Williams reads excerpts from Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy.  </P> <P> The Christmas Carol Video (Creative Programming tape) features the Choir of the  Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York singing 14 carols, including  "Silent Night." The well-photographed video includes a Christmas montage of the  choir, stained-glass windows and New England snow scenes including kids  building snowmen and families decorating trees.  </P> <P> A Classical Christmas (Kultur tape) is a painless tour of familiar Christmas  scenes (ice skaters, Christmas lights, the holiday art work of Currier and  Ives, Santa Claus and the like) accompanied by familiar Christmas music in  routine performances.  </P> <P> The Mormon Tabernacle Choir: Christmas Classics (Vestron tape) is the Utah  singers' first live music video album. "Joy to the World" is included.  </P> <P> Christmas songs sung by great classical singers have been best-sellers for  years on records. Now, several have made the transition to video. Kiri te  Kanawa at Christmas (V.I.E.W. tape) features the popular soprano with the  Tallis Chamber Choir. Mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade offers Christmas With  Flicka (V.I.E.W. tape) with Julius Rudel conducting.  </P> <P> Christmas With Luciano Pavarotti (Video Treasures) is a disappointing tape  because the video quality is so awful. But Pavarotti is Pavarotti and even in  blurry pictures and terrible monaural sound, the tenor soars on such classics  as "Ave Maria," "Silent Night" and "O Holy Night."  </P> <P> No one would dare sing along with these videos, so if you want a Christmas  sing-along, pick up a copy of Holiday Sing-Along With Mitch Miller and the  Sing-Along Gang (MGM/UA tape). It offers everything from "Jingle Bells" to  "White Christmas" in versions that will make any shower baritone or soprano  feel right at home.  </P> <P> In 1951, Gian Carlo Menotti and NBC-TV gave the nation a very special Christmas  gift, the premiere of Amahl and the Night Visitors. A 1979 "Hallmark Hall of  Fame" television special of the one-act opera is available (Video Artists  International tape). The singers, happily, are also actors. Soprano Teresa  Stratas (a diva in the Maria Callas mold) as the mother, and Robert Sapolsky (a  boy soprano) as a serious Amahl, are quite moving in this sweetly sung and  nicely acted production. The Philharmonic Orchestra is conducted by Jesus  Lopez-Cobos with Metropolitan Opera singers Giorgio Tozzi, Nico Castel and  Willard White.  </P> <P> No Christmas would be complete without Tchaikovsky's "The Nutcracker" ballet.  There are quite a few from which to choose. The Nutcracker to get is Mikhail  Baryshnikov's sparkling version with the American Ballet Theatre, featuring  Baryshnikov and Gelsey Kirkland (MGM/UA tape or Pioneer Artists' laser video  disc with digital sound). In Baryshnikov's version, the ballet becomes a  child's dream with a handsome prince, a wicked Mouse King, a princess, dancing  snowflakes, flowers and the Nutcracker.  </P> <P> Also available: an authentic Bolshoi Ballet version filmed in 1978 at the  Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow with Yekaterina Maximova and Vladimir Vasilev (Kultur  tape); a Royal Ballet version starring Lesley Collier and Anthony Dowell with  Gennady Rozhdestvensky conducting (HBO and Home Vision tapes and Pioneer  Artists laser video disc), and "The Nutcracker: The Movie" (Paramount tape), a  production designed by Maurice Sendak, the illustrator of enchanting children's  books. The imaginative costumes and scenery far outshine the rather pedestrian  production.  </P> <P> For non-purists, there is "The Nutcracker: A Fantasy on Ice," which stars  skaters Dorothy Hamill and Rolen Cousins with a narration by the late actor  Lorne Greene (Vestron tape).  </P> <P> If you would rather have a country-Western Christmas, there's a video version  of Dolly Parton's annual TV special A Smoky Mountain Christmas (Playhouse  tape). It's all about Dolly, a Tennessee cabin and seven orphans (no, they are  not named Grumpy, Sneezy, Doc and Dopey). Parton is in good voice and spirits.  </P> <P> If one of your warmest memories is sitting by the fireplace watching your  Christmas stockings and listening to carols, and you live in a place where  there are no fireplaces, or you're too lazy to buy some wood and start a fire,  why not turn your TV set into a warm, cozy fireplace?  </P> <P> Your Christmas Yule Log Fireplace is a 59-minute video that does the trick  (Video Naturals). You can enjoy a roaring Yuletide fire without ever leaving  your chair. As "The 12 Days of Christmas" fills the room, a poker jabs the logs  in the hearth. During "O Come All Ye Faithful," someone tosses more wood on the  fire. You don't move a muscle. During "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies," the  logs snap, crackle and pop.  </P> <P> It may just be that "Your Christmas Yule Log Fireplace" is the perfect video  and audio Muzak for the holiday season.

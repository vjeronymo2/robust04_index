			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, Feb 15 (CTK) -- The requirement that  food products imported into Slovakia have a quality certificate,  introduced unilaterally last week, has been interpreted wrongly,  director of the Customs Union Council (RCU) Secretariat Rudolf  Besik told CTK today.    The measure is nothing new and not in conflict with  legislation, Besik said. The problems that have resulted are  due only to insufficient preparation. He said the measure could  not influence Slovakia's trade balance.    Food products make up only 8 or 9 percent of total  Slovak-Czech trade. The share food products have in the Czech  Republic's trade surplus in the mutual balance of payments only  amounts to 2.5 billion Slovak crowns, Besik reported.    An exceptional RCU meeting could, he said, decide on the  recognition of the quality certificate which the Czech  Agricultural and Food Inspectorate (CZPI) has been issuing.  This could mean that Slovakia would drop its certificate  requirement with regard to the Czech Republic, he said.    Besik said he did not know the location or date of the RCU  extraordinary meeting, when asked to confirm Government  Spokesman Ondrej Hanka's statement that the economics minister  had been requested to convene the meeting for February 16.    Quality certification for the import of food products into  Slovakia came into effect on February 11.</p>

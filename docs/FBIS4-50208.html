			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] China is preparing to prosecute its most famous  dissident, Wei Jingsheng, on treason charges for asking the  United States Government to pressure Beijing for human rights  improvements, dissident and official sources said yesterday.  Police have also arrested three Shenzhen-based labour activists  accused of organising workers in sweatshop factories in southern  China, according to a Chinese source.    Diplomats in Beijing said these hardline measures could  endanger China's chances for renewal of Most Favoured Nation  (MFN) trading status with America. The arrests could also  destroy the points scored by Beijing by its "medical parole"  recently granted to "black hand" dissidents Wang Juntao and Chen  Ziming.    Dissidents and Justice Ministry sources said top officials  had decided against a more lenient three-year administrative  sentence in a labour camp for Wei, who is considered the father  of China's pro-democracy movement. Instead, Beijing would  prosecute him on charges of "plotting to overthrow the  Government using foreign forces", said a source with close ties  to the Justice Ministry.    Wei, 44, angered Chinese leaders when he met U.S. Assistant  Secretary of State for Human Rights John Shattuck in February  and asked him to use the threat of revoking MFN to gain improved  treatment of political prisoners. On April 1 he was stopped by  police as he tried to enter Beijing from a forced exile in  nearby Tianjin. Four days later police accused Wei, who had  been released last year after almost 15 years in prison, of  unspecified new crimes.    Authorities had been gathering evidence against the  outspoken  Wei since his release on parole last September, including  alleged evidence that he and his secretary, Tong Yi, who is also  to be tried, were living together but not married. After his  April detention government officials allegedly pressured Tong's  estranged husband to sue her for adultery. Under China's vague  and arbitrary administrative detention regulations, police could  then have sentenced both Wei and Tong to long labour camp  sentences for "lack of morals", thus avoiding a trial, one  dissident said. Tong's husband did not sue his wife.    The prosecution of Wei as a direct result of his contact  with  a high-ranking U.S. Government official carries serious  implications for U.S. President Bill Clinton. The weekend  parole of Chen Ziming had apparently made Mr Clinton's decision  on renewing MFN easier. But the prosecution of Wei, who was  first incarcerated on the personal orders of senior leader Deng  Xiaoping in 1979 for his calls for political reform, could  change that.    In addition to his alleged collusion with the U.S.  Government, dissident sources said, Wei could also be prosecuted  for writing an "illegal" autobiography, as well as his efforts  to provide financial assistance to blacklisted dissidents.    The three other men were arrested for trying to organise an  independent union in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. They  had put out two issues of a mimeographed underground newsletter  that aired worker complaints over low pay, forced overtime and  unsafe work conditions, and informed workers about laws and  regulations protecting their interests. A Chinese source  identified the three as Li Wenmin and Kuang Lezhuang, both  college students, and Liu Hutang, a factory worker.    The first issue of their newsletter attacked authorities for  allowing a Hong Kong-owned factory in Shenzhen to ignore safety  regulations, resulting in a fire that killed 84 workers.  "Rights will not be bestowed on us, but are something we must  fight for," it urged. "If we unite, we will become a powerful  force."    In March and April, police arrested four Beijing men and  briefly detained several others suspected of trying to form  unofficial worker organisations. One of the four escaped from  prison and fled the country, but the others remain held  incommunicado without any formal charges. [passage omitted]</p>

The DSA program is available to Farmer Programs (FP) borrowers, as defined in subpart S of this part, who suffered losses as a result of a 1993 disaster. FP loans that may be serviced under this subpart include Farm Ownership (FO), Operating (OL), Soil and Water (SW), Emergency (EM), Economic Emergency (EE), Special Livestock (SL), Economic Opportunity (EO), Softwood Timber (ST), Recreation (RL), and Rural Housing loans for farm service buildings (RHF). Nonprogram (NP) farm type loans may be serviced under this subpart for borrowers who also have FP loans. FP borrowers have until July 1, 1995, to request disaster set-aside and submit a complete application. Partial applications will not be acceptable. Requests received after July 1, 1995, will not be accepted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1951.952 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> General.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DSA is a program whereby borrowers who are current or not more than one installment behind on any and all FP loans may be permitted to move one Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) scheduled annual installment(s) for each eligible FP loan to the end of the loan term. The intent of this program is to relieve some of the borrower's immediate financial stress caused by the disaster and avoid foreclosure by the Government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1951.953 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Notification and request for DSA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notification.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The County Supervisor will use Form Letter 1951&hyph;T&hyph;1 to notify FP borrowers of the availability of the DSA program and how to apply. All FP borrowers, as defined in &sect;1951.906 of subpart S of this part, who have not been accelerated and who operated a farm or ranch in a county during 1993 in which a disaster occurred and was declared/designated as a disaster area or contiguous county, as set forth in subpart A of part 1945 of this chapter, will be notified within 10 days of the effective date of this subpart. However, those borrowers whose FP loan(s) has been accelerated, or restructured after a 1993 disaster, will not be notified under this paragraph. Notification of the DSA program will not affect the notification requirements set forth in subpart S of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Request for DSA.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All FP borrower liable for the debt must provide the County Office with the information described in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section on or before July 1, 1995 to request DSA.

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Amoco counters downtrend on pleasing results Wall Street THE DOWNWARD trend in share prices established since record highs for the major indices were reached last week continued yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 37.87 at 2,927.72, near its low for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell 3.25 to 380.95. The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks, which had enjoyed the best run since the start of the year, continued to underperform yesterday, dropping 6.81 to 494.38. Turnover on the New York SE was relatively light at 164m shares, and with declining stocks outpacing rises by a margin of about three-to-one the weak tone of the overall market was clearly evident. The recent market rally was fuelled primarily by expectations of US economic recovery, lower interest rates and a return to corporate profitability later this year. These hopes are now fully discounted in share prices, and in the absence of a strong lead from fresh economic news there is little reason for investors to buy stocks at the moment, said analysts. Among individual issues, quarterly earnings figures continued to produce a mixed reaction. In the oil sector, Mobil initially rose against the market trend after reporting a jump in three-monthly net income to Dollars 1.73 a share, up from 94 cents posted in the first quarter of 1990. However, the stock was unable to stand up against the general sell-off and closed down a net Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 67 5/8 . Amoco proved more resilient, holding on to its gain to end up Dollars 1/2 at Dollars 54 after also revealing improved first-quarter earnings, up from the Dollars 466m of last year to Dollars 803m. The long-running bid battle between NCR and AT&amp;T took another turn yesterday as NCR's stock forged ahead Dollars 5 1/8 to Dollars 101 7/8 on turnover of 1.8m shares after AT&amp;T said it was ready to improve its offer for the computer group to the equivalent of Dollars 110 a share. The development left AT&amp;T down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 36 1/4 on 2.7m traded. NCNB retreated Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 37 in active trading after the regional banking group said it had held merger talks with Southeast Bancorp and was considering making an offer for the Florida group in the near future. Southeast rose on the news at first, but eased back to close down Dollars  1/4 on balance at Dollars 5 3/4 . Bankers Trust put on Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 49 in spite of unveiling a 19 per cent decline in first-quarter profits to Dollars 160m. Martin Marietta, the defence equipment manufacturer which makes components for the Patriot anti-missile missile system used in the Gulf war, fell Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 55 in the wake of just a modest improvement in first-quarter net income to Dollars 1.44 a share, against Dollars 1.32 a share a year ago. Canada TORONTO partially recovered from an early decline during a quiet trading session. The composite index was finally down just 4.4 at 3,491.6, while declining stocks led advances by 333 to 205. Volume fell to 17m shares from Friday's 35.4m. Eight of the 14 sub-groups finished lower, although there were not any significant declines. Energy, industrial products, financial services and consumer products all posted small losses. The mining group ended steady while golds gained 2.49 per cent. Abitibi-Price, unchanged at CDollars 15 1/4 , saw its first-quarter loss decrease to 9 cents a share from the 17 cents recorded a year earlier. The company said it expects 1991 to be 'a difficult year'.</p>

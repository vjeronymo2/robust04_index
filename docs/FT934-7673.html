			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (13): Full speed ahead - Provincial focus: Sichuan province SICHUAN'S provincial government is keenly aware of the massive influx of foreign money which has fuelled industrial growth in China's southern coastal regions. The governor, Mr Xiao Yang, is determined to catch up. The province has one-tenth of China's 1.2bn population but only 6.5 per cent of gross national product and 6 per cent of the country's farmland. Development of an already substantial industrial base is essential both to soak up surplus farm labour and to boost living standards. Mr Xiao's aim is to double the province's per capita income from the current 650 yuan by the year 2000. Sichuan, birthplace of Deng Xiaoping, was a testing ground for reform in the late 1970s when Mr Zhao Ziyang, the former premier, was the province's party secretary. Its 90m peasants were early beneficiaries of agricultural reform and of township and village enterprises, the low-technology industrial ventures introduced to absorb farm labour. 'Now the peasants can get food and clothes but the situation is still not so satisfactory,' the governor says. Township and village enterprises employ 30m people, a quarter of the province's population, but Mr Xiao's aim is to double the figure. 'To fulfil this target, we need a huge investment,' he says. Sichuan, like other provinces, needs huge improvements in infrastructure and is weighed down by the behemoths of central planning: grossly inefficient state-owned enterprises which need reform and investment in new technology. Mr Xiao estimates that to meet his development targets, Yn36bn of investment is needed each year and would generate 10 per cent annual economic growth. The provincial government itself can find Yn24-26bn, he says, enough to generate growth of 7 to 8 per cent per year - modest by current Chinese standards. The rest must be sought by raising additional financing, from its own citizens, foreign investors or elsewhere. Over-enthusiastic attempts by local officials to raise money led to a crisis in the spring. Farmers became upset on two counts: local governments imposed a series of taxes and charges to fund projects such as new roads; and money provided by the central government to pay farmers for their produce was diverted into real estate speculation by officials who issued IOUs to the farmers instead of cash. Farmers were unimpressed by protestations that the real estate would produce a substantial return for their communities. THOUGH the practices were not unique to Sichuan, the province suffered the most severe consequences with riots and violent clashes which resulted in the dispatch of armed police as well as teams of officials to crack down on corruption. Mr Xiao says the tensions have now been resolved. Though there may still be poverty and unhappiness deep in the countryside, there is every sign of rampant growth in and around Sichuan's two key cities of Chongqing, an industrial port located at the meeting of the Yangtze and Jialing rivers, and Chengdu, the capital. Crane-filled skylines and busy shops and restaurants underline the flowering of commercial activity. Chengdu boasts its first underground shopping centre. A subway is planned under its boulevards. Though a large statue of Mao Zedong waves a regal hand over the main square, he would be appalled at the vibrant commercial activity he now surveys. The streets of Chongqing - which, because it is built on steep hills, has almost no bicycles - are clogged with traffic. A subway is planned there too and, local officials say, will be unaffected by financing problems because it is to be funded from Hong Kong. 'Chongqing is not like other places,' says Mr Chen Yuanhu, vice mayor. 'It is one of China's oldest industrial centres, with a huge base of industry. What we want to do is to make good use of money to develop key projects, not smaller ones.' Chongqing's motorcycle industry, producing one-third of China's output, is an example both of how the enterprises' problems can be tackled and of what is still to be done. Out of an arms factory in the huge Norinco group has come China Jialing group, where 12,000 employees turn out 18 per cent of Chinese motorcycle production under a technical agreement with Honda. Jialing plans to double output to 1m cycles by 1997. It is profitable. But officials appear vague about precise components and use of profit, as well as about its shareholding structure. Little progress has been made towards dismantling the 'iron rice bowl' commitments to the welfare of employees and their families. Meanwhile across the Yangtze river at the Chongqing Economic and Technological Development Area, the new China is being built at a feverish pace. Plots are being cleared for factories, even if much of the building actually in progress, including villas for expatriates, is for residential use. Some 150 enterprises involving foreign participation have signed up for the zone, with Dollars 360m of foreign money committed.</p>

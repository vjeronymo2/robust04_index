			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Mitterrand proposes constitutional reform PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand is to propose a series of constitutional reforms, including new judicial arrangements to try government ministers for their responsibility in such cases as the recent scandal over Aids-contaminated blood. In a television interview which he gave last night partly to deal with allegations that former Socialist ministers had escaped their responsibility in the transfusion of contaminated blood to haemophiliacs, Mr Mitterrand called for a change in the constitution that at present renders ministers immune from prosecution except by an ill-suited and little-used parliamentary impeachment procedure. In the meantime, however, he challenged the two houses of the parliament to set up a 'High Court of Justice' in the Aids-blood case. Though Mr Mitterrand did not mention any former ministers by name, the three people involved are Mr Laurent Fabius, current leader of the Socialist party, who was prime minister in the mid-1980s when the fateful transfusions took place, and two former health ministers. A court recently sentenced three senior doctors to prison. But the main surprise which Mr Mitterrand sprung on his audience was that his proposed judicial change would be part of a constitutional reform package to be unveiled this month. He said this would cover 'six or seven points', including a change to the seven-year, renewable mandate of French presidents, a 'better balance' between the executive and legislative branches, a strengthening of the judiciary's independence and an extension of the use of referenda. The president said this would amount to 'a cleaning up' of the Fifth Republic's 1958 constitution, rather than the institution of a new 'Sixth Republic'. It would nevertheless require the convening of a consultative constitutional committee, whose work would take some time. But Mr Mitterrand, who affirmed himself in good health and leading 'for the past 10 days a normal working life' after his September operation for prostate cancer, said he intended to be around until the end of his term in 1995 to see the constitutional reforms put in place. Mr Mitterrand first raised the issue of constitutional reform a year ago when he acknowledged that the two terms of seven years to which he had been elected were too long. Last night he refused to divulge his proposed reform. But he made it clear that, health permitting, he did not intend to apply retroactively any limitation of tenure to himself. The right-wing opposition had hoped that he might, in view of his low standing in the opinion polls. This has taken a further dive the past month. In a survey published in Le Figaro last weekend, only 34 per cent expressed confidence in the president, and 41 per cent in his prime minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy.</p>

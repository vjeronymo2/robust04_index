			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Voluntary Service Announced for </F> 1995"]    [Text] Voluntary community service should enter into force  in 1995. The young people involved in it will work in  nontrading sectors for a monthly wage of about 15,000 francs  [BFr]. The service will last a minimum of six months, a maximum  of 12 months, and a maximum of 24 months for foreign service.  That is the main thrust of the project set up by Defense  Minister Leo Delcroix that was presented Tuesday [22 February]  to the press. Voluntary community service (SVC), which is to  succeed the defunct obligatory military service, covers a period  during which a person voluntarily provides services aimed at  improving life in society via a particular institution or  organization.    In principle, SVC will be open to everyone, men and women,  Belgians and non-Belgians, whether able-bodied or handicapped,  without any restriction on age. Initially, however, it will be  limited to young people between the ages of 18 to 25.    SVC may, for example, be served in the health and welfare  sector, the sociocultural sector, in education and aid to young  people, in the environment or heritage conservation sector,  security at federal, regional, or local level, or in development  cooperation.    It will still be possible for any candidates who so desire  to  undertake voluntary military service.    Such candidates may, for example, participate in the armed  defense of the territory, even though -- during crisis periods  -- they will not be sent outside the national territory. "This  is neither a third labor channel nor a special, temporary  framework," Delcroix stressed. "Nor do we intend to use this  project to usurp the jobs which have devolved upon professional  labor."  <H5>  Methods </H5>   SVC candidates will enjoy a special contract. They will be  guaranteed social security protection during their service.  Thus, this period of service will be taken into account when  calculating pensions; it will count as a waiting period for  unemployment; family benefit will be maintained during service  up to the age of 25 years; and the level of social protection  (health/disability insurance) will be maintained.    Candidates will receive a nontaxable allowance of around  BFr15,000 per month and will have two holidays per month. At  present it is impossible to put forward a budget estimate of the  total cots of SVC in so far as the budget will depend on the  number of volunteers, Minister Delcroix stressed. The financial  breakdown of this cost could be as follows: The authority  concerned (regional or federal department) will pay a portion of  the BFr15,000 allowance, as well as social benefits, and  administrative costs.    The institution or organization which uses a volunteer will  pay a fixed amount per person per month, as well as insurance  premiums for the volunteers involved and any costs for training,  which it will provide itself.    In so far as the regions and communities have broad powers  in  the areas for which the SVC would apply, a consensus would have  to be reached within the negotiation committee, Delcroix  explained. The organization of the system would be centralized  among the departments of the prime minister, which would have a  coordination unit guaranteeing relations between national  departments, the communities, and the regions.    The project is to be submitted to the Council of Ministers  before the Easter vacation. Negotiations with the communities  and regions could be organized before 1 August 1994, the project  could be submitted to Parliament at the end of the year, and the  SVC could become a reality in 1995.</p>

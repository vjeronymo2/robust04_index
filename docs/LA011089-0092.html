			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> AFRICAN-AMERICAN CONFERENCE OPENS  </P> <P> President Kenneth D. Kaunda of Zambia opened the 19th African-American  Conference here Monday by calling on the international community to reflect on  the African debt crisis and the problem of apartheid.  </P> <P> Kaunda told the conference, attended by several black leaders from the United  States -- including civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and former U.S.  Ambassador to the United Nations Andrew Young -- that the two problems are the  fundamental cause of suffering on the continent.  </P> <P> He said that even though the U.N. economic program for the continent dates to  1969, no action has been taken to implement it because of inadequate  international support.  </P> <P> The Zambian president welcomed the signing of the tripartite agreement between  South Africa, Cuba and Angola but expressed surprise at how the international  community was supporting apartheid.  </P></p>

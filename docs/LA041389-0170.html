			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LITTLE ROCK 'BOND DADDY';  </P> <P> BUSINESSMAN ARRESTED IN SANTA ANA S&amp;L CASE  </P> <P> A Little Rock, Ark., businessman, indicted on racketeering and fraud charges in  connection with the failure of North America Savings &amp; Loan in Santa Ana,  has been arrested, the FBI said Wednesday.  </P> <P> David L. Morgan, 53, owner of Southland Securities in Little Rock, was arrested  Tuesday at his business on a warrant issued in California, according to FBI  spokesman Ron Wolfe.  </P> <P> Morgan was indicted along with five others by a grand jury in Los Angeles on  bank fraud and conspiracy charges dealing with multimillion-dollar losses  suffered by the now-defunct North America.  </P> <P> The 40-count indictment was related to the failure of that savings and loan in  1987 and alleges violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt  Organization, or RICO, statute, Wolfe said.  </P> <P> The founder of the S&amp;L, Orange County dentist Duayne D. Christensen, died  in a one-car accident in January, 1987, on the morning the S&amp;L was put into  receivership by the federal Home Loan Bank Board.  </P> <P> Morgan made an initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate H. David Young and was  released on his own recognizance, Wolfe said.  </P> <P> Wolfe said Morgan was "described locally as a broker and a real estate  venturer. He has owned several different ventures, most of which are closed."  </P> <P> Morgan, Wolfe said, was known in Little Rock as a "Bond Daddy" -- a type of  mortgage banker of whom a number are located in Little Rock, the second largest  mortgage banking center outside of New York.  </P> <P> "He was quite well known in Little Rock," Wolfe said.  </P> <P> Wolfe said the other five people indicted were also arrested Tuesday, in  California. He identified them as Janet F. McKinzie, 39, of Newport Beach;  Fredrick Youngdahl, 53, also of Newport Beach; Armando J. Vasquez, 52, of  Irvine; Victoria R. Walker, 42, of Elk Grove, and Thomas C. Clarke, 63, of  Vista.  </P></p>

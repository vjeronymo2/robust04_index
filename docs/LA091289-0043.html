			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Rockwell International Corp. placed full-page advertisements in the Rocky  Mountain News and the Denver Post to dispute allegations by the Environmental  Protection Agency that Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant near Denver had been  operated unsafely. The ad featured a letter signed by Donald R. Beall, Rockwell  chairman and chief executive, and Sam F. Iacobellis, executive vice president  in charge of Rocky Flats operations. The letter repeated statements made by the  two men last week to Rocky Flats employees that there is no evidence to support  the allegations. Rockwell operates Rocky Flats under contract to the U.S.  Energy Department. The plant manufactures plutonium triggers for nuclear  weapons.  </P></p>

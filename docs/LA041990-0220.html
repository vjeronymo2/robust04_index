			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORMER LAX POLICE OFFICER PLEADS NO CONTEST IN SEX CASE  </P> <P> A former Los Angeles International Airport police officer pleaded no contest  Wednesday to charges that he sexually assaulted two women in separate incidents  while he patrolled the airport in 1988.  </P> <P> Robert Julian Lopez, 32, is expected to receive a two-year prison sentence when  he returns on June 18 to Los Angeles Superior Court, said Deputy Dist. Atty.  </P> <P> Alan Yochelson.  </P> <P> Lopez was hired by the airport police department, which patrols LAX, in 1984.  </P> <P> The first incident occurred on May 22, 1988, when Lopez approached a teen-age  couple who sat in a parked car after their high school prom watching jets take  off, Yochelson said.  </P> <P> Lopez told the man to remain in the car while he searched the 18-year-old woman  in his patrol car. The teen-ager testified at a preliminary hearing that Lopez  fondled her, Yochelson said.  </P> <P> On Oct. 8, 1988, Lopez again approached a young couple in a car and told the  man to stay put while he brought the woman to his patrol car. Lopez handcuffed  the 21-year-old woman and forced her to perform a sex act, Yochelson said.  </P> <P> The woman identified Lopez a few hours later at the airport police  headquarters. Authorities showed the victim in the first case Lopez's picture  and she also identified him as her attacker.  </P> <P> Lopez was fired after his arrest. He remains free on $15,000 bail pending  sentencing.  </P></p>

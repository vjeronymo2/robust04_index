			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: Renault plunges to FFr240m RENAULT, France's state-owned car and truck group, yesterday announced that first-quarter profits had tumbled to just FFr240m (Dollars 44.3m) from FFr2.35bn in the same period of last year, and said that it saw no prospect of early recovery. The company said turnover in the quarter fell by less than the general decline in the European market, with Renault's combined car and truck sales 8 per cent down on the first quarter of 1992, at FFr43.9bn. However, Renault's first quarter results were dragged down by a FFr238m loss stemming from the group's 20 per cent stake in Volvo of Sweden, compared with the FFr180m loss it took in the first quarter of 1992. The only bright spots in an otherwise sombre picture were a 3 per cent rise in exports to countries outside Europe, compared with the same period of last year, and an increase of FFr45m in earnings from its financial service companies. 'With the economic climate for the second quarter apparently no more favourable, the prospects for an improvement in the European market are receding,' the company said. First-quarter cars sales fell by 8.6 per cent to FFr36.9bn, but sales in the overall European market fell by 17.2 per cent so that Renault held its market share. The same trend occurred in trucks, with Renault sales falling 13.4 per cent but with the European truck market plunging by 26.6 per cent. The pessimism of the French car industry has been vocally expressed by Mr Jacques Calvet, the head of Peugeot, who this week predicted that the overall decline in European car sales this year would be more than 10 per cent.</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Monsanto's Dollars 1m challenge Monsanto, the US chemicals group, is offering Dollars 1m to scientists who can devise a successful method of separating and recovering ammonia from waste streams containing organic chemicals. Monsanto said the problem was 'one of the industry's most vexing environmental questions'. Although the mixtures of ammonia and organic chemicals are not necessarily highly toxic, they comprise some of the largest volumes of Monsanto's industrial waste. Monsanto plans to provide Dollars 500,000 to fund the development of the research proposals that meet the company's criteria in the most cost-effective and commercially practicable manner. A second Dollars 500,000 will be paid if the research yields a successful process. Proposals must be submitted by the end of the year.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bobby Timonera] </F>   [Text] Three days before the 21st anniversary of the  National Democratic Front [NDF], a breakaway group announced it  would form its own panel in the peace negotiations with the  government.    The so-called Democratic Bloc of the NDF, in a clandestine  press conference outside Metro Manila yesterday, said Communist  Party founder Jose Ma. Sison and Luis Jalandoni "have forfeited  their right" to represent the NDF in the peace talks because  they have "subverted the integrity of the NDF."    The development was a consequence of the internal squabble  that has split the leftist movement since last year.    The NDF opposition bloc also said it has disowned the  leadership of Jalandoni, Communist Party Chair Armando Liwanag  (believed to be the rebel name of Sison), and NDF Chair Manuel  Romero.    Sol Oriente, spokesperson of the NDF-Democratic Bloc,  however, said they are not yet entering into "the fray of the  negotiations" between the government and the Sison-Jalandoni  group, which she said, was about to "self-destruct" anyway.    The NDF opposition bloc said the ongoing peace talks were an  "exercise in futility" because of the insincerity of both sides.    Oriente said her group emanated from the so-called  "Verdaderos" which denounced last year Liwanag's alleged  maneuvers in the NDF. She said the group will first consolidate  its ranks before coming up with its peace panel within the year.    Oriente hinted that government representatives have already  approached them.    Servando Populo of the NDF-Visayas said that if conditions  warranted, they may be amenable to a local venue.    "It's actually a secondary issue for us," he said.    Populo, a priest who once worked with Jalandoni in the  Visayas, said they may open their guerrilla zones to the  government panel and give negotiators safe-conduct passes.    His group is also entertaining the possibility of a  "rotating  venue" wherein the government and the NDF will take turns in  choosing the site.    Oriente said Sison's group has been so preoccupied with  acquiring a status of belligerency -- like insisting on a  foreign venue and getting a third party observer -- that it  failed to bring the negotiations toward the discussion of  substantive issues.    At the same time, Populo hit the Ramos Administration for  its  continued "total war policy," arrests of political dissenters,  and lack of implementation of real social and economic reforms.    In a statement signed by 12 ranking rebel leaders from all  over the country, the "NDF opposition" accused the Liwanag camp  of rewriting the underground umbrella organization's history by  declaring all resolutions of the NDF 1990 Congress non-existent;  suspending all national leading bodies and structures; and,  usurping the leadership of the NDF.    "Objections and protests were severely dealt with through  arbitrary ouster and expulsion of leaders and individuals, and  disenfranchisement of entire chapters and sections," the  statement added.    The anti-Sison group is reportedly composed of national  council and national executive committee officers, leaders, and  mass members of the Christians for National Liberation (CNL);  Katipunan ng mga Gurong Makabayan [Union of Nationalist  Teachers] (Kaguma); Malayang Samahang Pangkalusugan [Independent  Organization for Health] (MSP); Pambansang Katipunan ng  Magbubukid [National Union of Farmers] (PKM); Rebolusyonaryong  Konseho ng Kilusang Unyon [Revolutionary Council of Union  Movement] (RKKU); Moro Revolutionary Organization (MRO);  Malayang Kilusan ng Bagong Kababaihan [as published; Independent  Movement of New Womanhood] (Makibaka); Kabataang Makabayan  [Nationalist Youth] (KM); and the NDF-Visayas, NDF-Mindanao,  NDF-Western Europe, and NDF-United States of America.    They blamed the Liwanag faction of practically cutting party  membership into half because party cadres and members were  either sacked or voluntarily left, disillusioned with its  "absolutionist and undemocratic leadership."    "What Liwanag has today is his party faction masquerading as  the NDF," the statement said.    The group also denounced the announcement by Gregorio "Ka  [Comrade] Roger" Rosal that a "people's court" has been convened  to mete out death penalty to four ranking CPP [Communist Party  of the Philippines] leaders accused by Sison as "renegades."    They are former NPA [New People's Army] Chief Romulo  Kintanar; former CPP Secretary General Ricardo Reyes; former CPP  Visayas Commission Chief Arturo Tabara; and, Metro Manila CPP  Chief Felimon Lagman.    Earlier, Rosal, speaking for the Communist Party of the  Philippines and the New People' Army, admitted responsibility  for the assassination of former NPA leader Leopoldo Mabilangan  alias Ka Hector last Easter Sunday.</p>

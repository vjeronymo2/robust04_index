			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Continued progress lifts Epwin to Pounds 1.75m EPWIN Group, the maker of PVC-u windows and doors, continued its recent progress with a 34 per cent advance in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.75m in the six months to June 30. The rise from Pounds 1.31m was struck on turnover up 20 per cent at Pounds 24.7m (Pounds 20.5m). With the exception of the commercial sector, which serves local authorities and the Property Services Agency, volume increases were gained in all the group's other UK markets. Mr John Townsend, finance director, said that 'the mix was essential' to the group's success, which 'tracked back to the Telford extrusion plant' which has absorbed some two thirds of the Pounds 9.9m capital expenditure programme instigated in March 1992. 'When the volume comes through, you get a return on capital,' he said. Mr Jim Rawson, chairman, said that Epwin had expected a poor winter, partly because of the general economic climate and partly because of the seasonal nature of the group's business. So the group mothballed the South Wales factory in December with the loss of about 100 jobs. However, the anticipated decline did not materialise in November, December or subsequently, and the factory was reopened, though with some savings on the wages front. Mr Rawson said that the pick-up in the market now stretched to eight months and that the group had continued to gain market share. He added that there was 'some level of returning confidence by home owners and their willingness to invest in property improvement'. Earnings per share expanded 14 per cent, from 5p to 5.7p, and the interim dividend is lifted to 2.3p, an increase of 10 per cent on last time's 2.1p. At the period-end, there were no external borrowings.</p>

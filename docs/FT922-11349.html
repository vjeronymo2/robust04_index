			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Tokyo minister enters farm trade fray MR Kozo Watanabe, Japan's international trade and industry minister, plays host to his US, EC and Canadian counterparts today amid the faint hope that the meeting will inspire compromise on farm trade issues. When Japan named Mount Bandai in Fukushima, Mr Watanabe's childhood home, as the venue for the 'trade quad', it had been hoped the US-EC farm trade dispute, that has since the end of 1990 blocked settlement of the Uruguay Round of talks on reform of world trade, would have been resolved. However, Mr Watanabe will be relieved that the Washington summit on Wednesday between President George Bush and Mr Jacques Delors, EC Commission president, did not end in acrimony, although it failed to find a compromise. Today's meeting should have been an opportunity to celebrate success, and to shift focus forward to a leading Japanese concern - the Rio Earth Summit in June, and the potential clashes between the call for free trade, and environmental protection. Instead, Mr Watanabe finds himself in the hot seat. Japan, perhaps more any other country, has much to lose from the rising protectionism that could result from a failure of the Uruguay Round. Along with Canada - which as an exporter of farm products has been vocal in pressing both the US and the EC to dismantle farm protection systems - Tokyo is likely to express robust views over the failure of the US and the EC to reach a compromise. Mr Michio Watanabe, Japan's foreign minister, last week wrote an unusually blunt letter to both Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, and Mr Frans Andriessen, the EC's trade negotiator, calling for compromise and warning of the dangers of failure. However, expectations must now be low that headway can be made. The EC has presented 'new ideas' - so yet not publicly defined.</p>

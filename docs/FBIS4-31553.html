			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, June 10 (TANJUG) -- The United States  continues flirting with the Bosnian Muslims, so that Yugoslavia  (Serbia/Montenegro), which is in no way involved in the civil  war in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, has  to bear the brunt of it, diplomatic and political circles in  Belgrade say on Friday.    This assessment is based on the latest threats by top U.S.  officials that if the Bosnian Muslims reject the peace plan,  they would be punished by a gradual lifting of sanctions against  Yugoslavia and, if the Bosnian Serbs fail to accept the plan,  the Bosnian Muslims would in return be exempt from the U.N. arms  embargo (in force for all of the former Yugoslavia) and the  anti-Yugoslav sanctions tightened.    The United States has for the first time officially admitted  that the anti-Yugoslav sanctions were entirely politically  motivated rather than caused by Yugoslavia's alleged aggression  against Bosnia-Herzegovina, the circles say.    The sanctions aimed to force Yugoslavia to pressure the  Bosnian Serbs to renounce their right to self-determination,  create a chaos in Serbia and effect a change of authorities  there.    After these two intentions had failed, the U.S. engineered a  new one -- to make the lifting of the sanctions conditional on  the peace in Bosnia.    Thus, the U.S. simultaneously threatened to punish either  the  Bosnian Serbs or Muslims. Belgrade says the parallel threats  aim to justify a decision of the House of Representatives to  unilaterally exempt the Bosnian Muslims from the U.N. arms sales  embargo.    Belgrade describes the decision, which is still to be  confirmed by the Senate and can be vetoed by U.S. President Bill  Clinton, as political calculations which are hardly applicable  in practice, because a final decision to exempt the Muslims from  the embargo would simultaneously give others the right to  unilaterally lift the anti-Yugoslav sanctions.    The U.S. is fully aware of this, but its obvious intention  is  to pressure the Bosnian Serbs into accepting the peace plan. It  has already estimated that the Serbs are very likely to reject  the peace plan, whose concept is much closer to what the Bosnian  Muslim government regards as a reasonable solution.    U.S. officials say that in the next six weeks America and  its  NATO allies will come out with a plan, which incorporates also a  map of territorial delineation between the Bosnian Muslim-Croat  federation and the Serbs.    Belgrade believes that the maps will be drawn up to the  benefit of the Bosnian Muslims and to the Bosnian Serbs'  detriment. The Serbs are thus bound to reject it, which would  supply an excuse for the sanctions to be prolonged.    If the United States and its closest allies actually wish to  bring the Bosnian war to an end and to find a political solution  acceptable to all, the first step is definitely the lifting of  the sanctions against Yugoslavia.</p>

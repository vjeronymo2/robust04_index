			<p>Environmental   Projects   <F P=102> AU2805153794 Prague CTK in English 1926 GMT 27 May 94 </F> <F P=103> AU2805153794 </F> <F P=104>  Prague CTK </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN     [Text] Karvina, North Moravia, May 27 (CTK) -- The  government will financially support only "non-standard"  environmental protection projects, Premier Vaclav Klaus told  journalists after visiting the most devastated localities of the  Karvina black coal mining area today.    Klaus said that towns and villages would have to implement  by  themselves standard projects aimed at restoring the environment  spoilt by mining. He described as useful the current efforts by  the management of the Ostravsko-Karvinske Doly mining company  and representatives of the town of Karvina at establishing a  proper co-existence which in practice would mean the abolition  of the long-lasting "dictate" from the miners.    In connection with the planned sale of some 20,000  apartments  in Karvina Klaus said that in his view the general intention to  sell apartments to their owners is "an idea erroneous from the  very beginning which will get us nowhere and will only cause  endless problems. I have never advised anyone to sell  individual apartments, I have always recommended that owners be  found for whole buildings within which flats would continue to  be rented," Klaus said. He added that the sale of individual  apartments would lead to the appearance of new, just as  inflexible housing management firms.    During his visit to Karvina Klaus delivered a lecture at the  Commercial and Business faculty of the Silesian University. He  said that the development of the Czech economy thus far showed  that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) could grow this year by  two to three per cent with the unemployment rate not exceeding  four per cent at the end of the year.    At the evening Klaus met Karvina inhabitants at a public  rally.</p>

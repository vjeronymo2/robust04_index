			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Race is on to be first with the big picture: High definition TV For the world's consumer electronics manufacturers, nothing is more important than the race to develop large television screens with sparkling clear pictures. For the Japanese, high definition television (HDTV) is an opportunity to consolidate their lead in consumer electronics. For the Americans, it is a chance to get back into an industry they have virtually abandoned. For Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE) of France and Philips of the Netherlands, Europe's largest consumer electronics companies, wide-screen HDTV is the key to their future viability. The European Commission is reported to be close to agreement with industrialists and broadcasters on a common standard for clearer television pictures. If the accord, making the D2-Mac standard compulsory for all European satellite broadcasters, is endorsed by Commission telecommunications ministers on June 3, Thomson and Philips will have won a substantial political victory. Whether they can translate their gain into commercial success is more doubtful. It is one thing to force satellite broadcasters to adhere to a particular standard. It is another to persuade viewers that it is worth paying extra for the clearer pictures. British Satellite Broadcasting, which last year merged with Sky Television to create British Sky Broadcasting, largely failed to persuade the UK public of the virtues of its D-Mac system, the British version of D2-Mac. The D2-Mac standard, Europe's preferred route, could, in any event, soon be surpassed technologically by research in the US. The US Federal Communications Commission has chosen six candidates to compete to create a high definition standard. It is likely that they will opt for an entirely digital system. The D2-Mac system is partially analogue. TCE and Philips both desperately need a successful consumer electronics product. TCE's net losses more than quadrupled last year to FFr680m (Pounds 68m). Philips, although financially troubled, is in a slightly different position. The Dutch group, Europe's largest electronics company, last year declared a record net loss of Fl 4.2bn (Pounds 1.3bn). Its consumer electronics division, however, was its only successful performer. Partly boosted by last year's World Cup, which stimulated sales of television sets and video cassette recorders, its profits rose 32 per cent to Fl 1.7bn. Given the weakness of its computer, semiconductor and lighting divisions, it is essential for Philips that its consumer electronics activities continue to show that sort of progress. The company does have a few other products on the cards. Next year it will launch the digital compact cassette (DCC), a high fidelity tape system. High definition television, however, remains its most important consumer electronics project. Both Philips and Thomson have received generous financial backing from their governments for HDTV research, based on the Mac system. A 1986 European Community directive required all satellite broadcasters to use the Mac system. The thinking behind the directive was that satellite broadcasters would begin with either D-Mac, to be used in Britain, or with D2-Mac, the system chosen by the rest of Europe. D-Mac and D2-Mac are not fully fledged high definition systems, but they do provide clearer pictures than those currently available in Europe. Eventually, it was hoped that broadcasters would move on to HD-Mac, Europe's own high definition system. The directive expires at the end of the year and a new one will take its place. Thomson and Philips have demanded that the new directive should make D2-Mac compulsory for all satellite broadcasters. Companies such as British Sky Broadcasting have so far evaded the directive by broadcasting from Astra, officially classified as a telecommunications, rather than a television, satellite. The Commission has been talking to BSkyB about the possibility of broadcasting simultaneously in D2-Mac and Pal, the conventional UK television system which it uses at the moment. Thomson and Philips say that the development of fully digital television in the US will not affect plans. Such a system, they say, will not be viable until after the turn of the century. However, the US system would be suitable for broadcast by satellite, cable and terrestrial transmission. Mr Dermot Nolan, a consultant for accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, said in a recent HDTV study that this would mean US manufacturers would have access to the entire broadcasting marketplace - in contrast to both the Europeans and the Japanese, who were concentrating on satellite only. Mac, Mr Nolan believes, is an isolationist technology designed mainly to keep out the Japanese. 'Without a radical re-positioning of the European HDTV strategy, European high definition will not materialise as a successful proposition and the future will belong to American digital HDTV and Japanese companies licensing the technology from US vendors,' Mr Nolan argues. The concentration on satellite broadcasting as the route to HDTV also raises the problem that most Europeans will continue to receive only ground-based broadcasts. By the end of 1990, 1.8m European homes had satellite dishes - only 1.3 per cent of the total. According to Zenith Media Worldwide, part of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, this figure will grow to about 23m homes by 2000, still only 17 per cent. Instead of simply concentrating on D2-Mac, the UK's Department of Trade and Industry is arguing for a twin approach: Mac as the preferred standard for satellite television, but with no compulsion for Pal users such as BSkyB, and the development of an improved Pal system for use on terrestrial television. The government has decided to fund a Pal research project under the Eureka high technology programme, involving the BBC in Britain and ZDF, the German network. Granada Television of the UK and ARD of Germany might also join. This research could eventually provide wide-screen, better quality television for everyone. Philips and Thomson will be hoping that, in the meantime, they can create a large market for D2-Mac.</p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / How To Spend It: An old lady of distinction - Lucia van der Post celebrates a fashionable lady's 75 years and finds bespoke tailoring that won't cost men a fortune FOR SUCH a fashionable lady 75 is quite an age to admit to. But yes, it is true, Vogue really is 75 years old this year. The first British issue was published during the First World War, on September 15 1916. Most of the editorial matter was supplied from New York, although there were some sops to local British interests. It sold for just a shilling. Wartime restrictions meant that it carried no advertisements. Times may be hard now in glossy magazine advertising circles but even so the current issue sells for Pounds 2.50 and there are at least 89 pages of glossy advertisements keeping apart the 204 pages of editorial. At the height of the boom times, in October 1988, the fattest issue of all carried 333 pages of advertisement and 170 of editorial. If Conde Nast himself could have lived to see it] For a magazine which sells just 172,387 copies it has always had an influence that goes way beyond size. As Peter York, that subtle interpreter of current trends and attitudes puts it: 'It's a big little circulation. It is the biggest, most glamorous, full-tilt, paid for, glossy there is. It has a huge pass-on readership and is read by far more people than those who pay for it. It doesn't appeal to a single class more it unites an attitude group, people who think clothes and fashion are important.' Vogue was always intended to be a very classy number. Conde Nast, who founded one of the world's most famous magazine empires, never started a magazine himself. He bought them all, from Vanity Fair and House and Garden through to his flagship Vogue. 'Class not mass' was the company motto and the culture has hardly changed. Circulation was never of prime importance but Conde Nast is not in the business of running loss-making operations for the sake of prestige. Daniel Salem, chairman of Conde Nast Publications, makes it very clear that 'Vogue is the flagship not just in terms of prestige but also in terms of profit.' Nobody is talking precise figures because nobody has to. One Vogue strength is that Conde Nast is answerable to nobody but itself - Si Newhouse, his brother Donald and other family members own Advance Publications, the parent company. There are no outside shareholders, nobody whose opinions they are obliged to listen to. If the Newhouses want to do something, it is done. According to a recent Time magazine article, the Advance empire is one of the largest family fortunes in the US, probably worth Dollars 11bn. Si Newhouse's father was the man who bought the Conde Nast empire back in 1963 after Conde Nast himself had suffered a series of complicated financial reversals. Rather like the man who liked the razor and so bought the company, rumour has it that in 1959 Si Newhouse's wife Mitzi asked him to go out and buy her Vogue. Some Dollars 5m poorer he came back with Conde Nast. Vogue has always generated a mythology of its own. To those whose journalistic lives were spent outside its glossy environs it always seemed an infinitely frothy place. It always seemed a centre of happenings, of much weeping as fearsome editors conducted their reigns of terror, of top editors hired for mouth-watering sums and, above all, as home of the mysterious breed universally known as Voguettes. These were the numerous junior assistants or reporters who followed in the wake of their high priestesses, the section editors. They were rumoured to be paid a pittance but always had a way of making everybody else's designer clothes look like last year's rejects. Georgina Howell, in her book Sultans of Style, describes how she won Vogue's annual talent contest and was initiated into the Voguette's code. She was given 'a small red paper-bound book entitled So You Have Joined Conde Nast. It told her to 'wear a plain dark costume to the office, not to wear jewellery other than a string of pearls, and to have a hat and gloves for the journey to and from the office.' It warned her on no account to discuss her salary. This, remember, was in the early 1960s when Biba, Mary Quant et al were just about to burst upon the scene. Her reward for winning the talent contest was to water the plants and take messages for Peter Coats, the distinguished garden editor. 'Tell Peter,' commanded the Duchess of Westminster, 'that I must have my feather boa back by Saturday.' But even Vogue has to change. Once upon a time, so legend had it, Vogue had only to decree that it was a beige and cream year and every shop in town did its windows in beige and cream and lo and behold the people did wear beige and cream. These days it does not try to dictate. It edits, refines and presents a variety of the best options. Or, as Daniel Salem would put it, 'it sets a mood.' It changes, as all things must, to survive. It has always been primarily a visual magazine but Vogue and Conde Nast have always nurtured and supported a range of talented people. Looking back over the years the list of contributors is impressive. It ranges from famous photographers such as Cecil Beaton, Bailey, and Snowdon, writers like Gertrude Stein, Aldous Huxley, DH Lawrence and Colette, and food stars such as Boulestin, Robert Carrier and Elizabeth David. Designers like Mary Quant, Ossie Clark, Foale and Tuffin, Zandra Rhodes were all given spreads and exposure. Most of went on to become household names but they were unknowns when Vogue spotted them. There have been times, though, when the opposition has given Vogue quite a run for its money. Queen under Jocelyn Stevens in the 1960s gave it quite a fright. The Face and Arena gave it pause for thought and it is no accident that Conde Nast now owns 40 per cent of them. 'Buying into those magazines magazines gives us a foothold in the future and access to a hothouse of talent,' says Daniel Salem. 'There is no doubt that times now are tough - I personally have never known them so bad in 35 years in publishing but we have the resources to see them out. Sometimes it is much more interesting to improve the bottom-line than turnover. The key, above all, is to be number one in your field. There can, after all, be only one bible.' There Vogue seems secure.</p>

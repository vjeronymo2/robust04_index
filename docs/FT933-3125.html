			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Polypipe sees revival as profits rise 11% THE long-depressed UK building sector is beginning to show vigorous signs of life, according to Polypipe which yesterday reported buoyant sales and profits for the year to June 30. Mr Kevin McDonald, chairman, said the group was experiencing increased business 'right across the building sector'. The order book had returned to normal levels, he said. 'This is the first normal year we have had in four years.' New buildings account for about 12 per cent of group sales. Polypipe, which manufactures pipes for industrial and commercial use and other domestic plastic products such as bathroom fixtures, windows and garden furniture, said sales volumes were running between 4.5 per cent and 6.5 per cent ahead of last year in the various divisions. The group reported an 11 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 17.1m (Pounds 15.4m), on sales also 11 per cent ahead to Pounds 120.5m (Pounds 108.3m). Acquisitions contributed Pounds 600,000 to sales and Pounds 50,000 to profits. The growth was achieved through a combination of new products and and growing market share, said Mr McDonald. Exports also rose by 15 per cent to Pounds 9.4m, with the strongest increase in sales to the Middle East. Operating margins were slightly ahead of last year, rising from 14.26 per cent to 14.42 per cent. The group's core business, above and below ground pipe fittings continued to grow, the company said. Polypipe claimed 21 per cent of the above ground drainage market, and 16 per cent of the domestic underground sector. Mr McDonald said the group had increased market share in spite of the imposition of higher prices. He stressed that the group would not hesitate to raise prices again if raw material costs continued to increase. Polypipe spent some Pounds 12.5m on capital expenditure, similar to that of last year, and 1.7 times the rate of depreciation. It planned to spend Pounds 12m this year. The group ended the year with net cash of Pounds 6.7m. Earnings per share rose by 11 per cent to 7.4p (6.69p). The proposed final dividend is being increased by 7.5 per cent to 1.44p for a total of 2.1p (1.97p).</p>

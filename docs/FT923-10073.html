			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Abbey Panels Pounds 1m in the red LOSSES at Abbey Panels Investments, an engineer to the motor, aerospace and defence industries, widened from Pounds 110,000 to Pounds 1.18m pre-tax for the half year ended March 31. Sales tumbled from Pounds 10.38m to Pounds 5.51m and losses per share worked through at 49.8p (13.2p). The directors pointed to their last statement, which indicated that the downward trend in the company's trading results would continue. They said: 'This has certainly been the case. The results speak for themselves. The recessionary effect of work cut-back and slashed margins have had a devastating effect.' They added that the introduction of a new product line had added to the problem. Meanwhile, they would 'continue watching all outgoings and costs' and act to minimise them where necessary. They did not see any signs of improvement, 'certainly during the rest of 1992.' Pre-tax losses for the 1990-91 year amounted to Pounds 234,000.</p>

In addition, the address or location of any ESG-assisted housing used as a family violence shelter may not be made public without the written authorization of persons responsible for the operation of the shelter. This new certification is included in the application kit, as provided in Section III of this NOFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Establishes habitability standards.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 832(g) of NAHA requires the Secretary to prescribe the minimum standards of habitability appropriate to ensure that emergency shelters assisted by this program are environments that provide appropriate privacy, safety, and sanitary and other health-related conditions for homeless persons and families.

CHAS and NEPA Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Indian tribes are not included in NAHA's definition of ``jurisdiction'', the entity charged with submitting a Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) under section 105 of NAHA. Therefore, Indian tribes are not required to submit a CHAS. Furthermore, Indian tribes will not be required to certify to consistency with the State's CHAS to receive ESG funding. The Department reiterates its position stated in adopting the CHAS Interim Rule (56 FR 4484, February 4, 1991) that, given the sovereign status of Indian tribes, a State cannot be deemed the appropriate jurisdiction to apply its housing strategy to programs administered by Indian tribes (see 56 FR 4481&hyph;82).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The assumption of environmental responsibilities specified in section 104(g)(1) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 was authorized for certain recipients of assistance under the McKinney Act, pursuant to section 443 of the McKinney Act. Assumption of the responsibilities for the ESG program is set forth in 24 CFR 576.52, and shall apply to Indian tribes in the same manner as described for a unit of general local government or territory. When the tribe does not have the legal capacity to assume the environmental responsibility (see 24 CFR 58.11), the appropriate HUD Office of Native American Programs (ONAP) Field Office will conduct the environmental review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> D.

Indian Program Office set-aside allocations of the total amount are detailed in the following chart:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Label Size and Format for Instantaneous Water Heaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPR noted that, because the physical size of gas-fired instantaneous water heaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (they are often no larger than one to three cubic feet) is usually significantly smaller than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  most storage-type water heaters, the currently required 5 and 5/16 inches by 7 and 3/8 inches  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  label could be too large to fit on some of the smaller models. <FOOTCITE>74</FOOTCITE>  There is also the possibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  that the surface temperature of the products could affect label adhesion. The NPR requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  comment on whether the EnergyGuide label currently required for water heaters is appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  for instantaneous water heaters and, if not, what would be better. <FOOTCITE>75</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 74 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Gas-fired instantaneous water heaters are usually larger than electric models, and some larger models could be used for whole-house applications in small houses. Electric instantaneous water heaters (for which labeling rules were not proposed in the NPR) are usually small and for limited point-of-use, as for a particular sink or shower.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 75 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 58 FR 7854. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Four comments responded to this request. Paloma contended that labeling on the front  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jacket of instantaneous water heaters is impossible because of the room taken up by other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required labels and is, therefore, technologically infeasible. Paloma also contended that,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because of the product's surface temperature, a paper label would be inappropriate. Paloma  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concluded that, under the circumstances, an aluminum label with special adhesive would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary, which would be an economic burden. Paloma recommended, therefore, a tag-type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> label. <FOOTCITE>76</FOOTCITE>  GAMA and CEC stated that the conventional label that is currently required would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be appropriate for most models. Both commented that the issue of surface temperature is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> irrelevant because EnergyGuides are required on products only until they are sold, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be before the water heater was fired for the first time. GAMA recommended allowing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a hang-tag type label, as did Washington Gas. <FOOTCITE>77</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 76 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Paloma, E&hyph;2, 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 77 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> GAMA, E&hyph;3, 2 (GAMA also recommended allowing the option of hang-tags for heat pump water heaters); CEC, EE&hyph;2, 5; Washington Gas, EE&hyph;1, 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission agrees with the comments that both conventional label types ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> paper, rather than aluminum) and hang-tag type labels will be appropriate for instantaneous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water heaters. Hang-tags may be preferable in some instances, such as when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instantaneous heater is too small to accommodate conventional labels. Section 305.11(a)(7)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Rule currently allows for the use of hang-tags as long as they are affixed in such a way  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that they will be prominent to a consumer examining the product. Therefore, the Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permits manufacturers of instantaneous and heat pump water heaters to exercise the hang-tag  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Disclosure of Tank Size on Label for Heat Pump Water Heaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Heat pump water heaters are marketed in two ways. They can be sold as an integral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit that includes the heat pump and the storage tank, or they can be sold without a tank and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hooked up with an existing water heater with the conventional heating system shut off. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those instances in which the heat pump water heater is sold without a tank, the DOE test calls  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for measurement of energy use with the heat pump water heater connected to a 47-gallon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity storage tank. Thus, even when no tank is to be sold with the heat pump water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heater, manufacturers will be able to determine the energy use figure to put on the label for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparative shopping purposes. The product's efficiency, however, could be affected by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> size of the tank with which it is coupled. The NPR solicited comment, therefore, on whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the label should include a statement that determination of the heat pump water heater's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency is based on use with a 47-gallon tank and that its efficiency in the home may vary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> according to the size of the storage tank to which it is connected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two comments addressed this issue. CEC stated that the statement that the efficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of heat pump water heaters could be affected by the size of the tank with which it is coupled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is only necessary in the case where the manufacturer does not supply the tank. CEC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that, in this case, the label should identify the size of the tank assumed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of determining the energy factor. <FOOTCITE>78</FOOTCITE>  GAMA stated that the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> standby loss  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> of the tank,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not its  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> size <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , is what is relevant. Thus, heat pump water heater labels should not state that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency of the water heater could be affected by the size of the tank with which it is coupled. GAMA also contended that, given the limited ranges of sizes and standby losses of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tanks coupled with heat pump water heaters, such a statement on the EnergyGuide would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be worthwhile from a consumer benefit standpoint. <FOOTCITE>79</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 78 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> CEC, EE&hyph;2, 7. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 79 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> GAMA. E&hyph;3, 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission agrees with GAMA that the effect on energy consumption will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be significant enough to require a disclosure on the EnergyGuide label. Thus, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission has determined not to require the statement described above concerning tank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> size.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

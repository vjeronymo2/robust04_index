			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hunters Armley rises 29% Hunters Armley, the commercial printer which last week expanded with the purchase of a private Bristol-based printing company, increased pre-tax profits by 29 per cent in the year to September 30. Investment in new production facilities and the addition of more than 100 new customer accounts helped lift profits to Pounds 3.46m (Pounds 2.67m), on turnover up 27 per cent at Pounds 41.1m (Pounds 32.2m). Despite increases in paper prices of up to 60 per cent, operating margins rose from 9 per cent to 9.2 per cent. Operating profit jumped 30 per cent to Pounds 3.77m (Pounds 2.9m). Mr Brian Sugden, managing director, said: 'Increased paper costs are an opportunity not a threat for us, because they show that there is increased demand.' Capital expenditure of the group, which floated in December 1992, amounted to Pounds 6.3m, including the installation of two new web offset presses at the Bradford plant, which now has the same capacity as the Leeds plant. A rights issue in May, which raised Pounds 9.4m, helped the group record a net cash position of Pounds 3.06m, against net borrowings of Pounds 3.7m and 54 per cent gearing last time. On December 5 it acquired Harlequin Colourprint, the Bristol-based sheet-fed printer, for a maximum consideration of Pounds 4.4m. In the last financial year Harlequin made pre-tax profits of Pounds 258,000 and has made profits of more than Pounds 500,000 in the first nine months of this year. Mr Sugden said that the group would be looking to make further acquisitions of sheet-fed printers in London and Scotland. Earnings per share were up 11 per cent at 10.01p (9.05p). The proposed final dividend is 2.68p making 4p (3.75p) for the year, a 6.7 per cent increase.</p>

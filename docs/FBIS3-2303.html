			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Gan Zhebin (3927 0772 2430) and Zhang Lei </F> (1728 7191)]    [Text] Beijing, 7 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Upon his  arrival in Beijing from Hong Kong today to attend the Second  Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC], Zhou  Nan, NPC deputy and director of the Hong Kong Branch of the  XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, told reporters during a special interview  that, although the British side is not cooperating on the Hong  Kong issue, the Chinese side, along with the Hong Kong  compatriots, can absolutely ensure Hong Kong's steady transition  and prolonged prosperity and stability. This is beyond  question, and no force can stop us from achieving this objective.    Zhou Nan said: We are now in an important period for the  country to carry out reform and opening up and establish the  socialist market economy. Some major reform measures will be  introduced. We hope to solicit opinions through these "two  sessions" and correctly handle the relations between  development, stability, and reform. In addition, we will  further carry out the policy of "doing two types of work  simultaneously," namely, we will pay attention to material and  spiritual civilizations and to the formation of the democratic  and legal systems to enable the country's economic modernization  to embark on a healthy track.    One of the two reporters asked if the Hong Kong issue would  become a hot topic at the "two sessions." Zhou Nan said he  believed that Premier Li Peng's government work report would  refer to the Hong Kong issue, that the Hong Kong NPC deputies  and members as well as the mainland NPC deputies and members  will make some comments on the Hong Kong situation, and that, to  express state and popular intentions, the NPC and the National  Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference will, of course, respond to this issue.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, June 28 (BTA) -- Prime Minister Lyuben Berov  received today Greek Public Order Minister Stilianos-Angelos  Papathemelis, who is paying an official visit here at the  invitation of the Ministry of the Interior. Papathemelis  delivered Berov the most cordial greetings of Greek Prime  Minister Andreas Papandreou and an invitation to visit Athens.    The two sides discussed possibilities for cooperation  between  the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior and the Greek Ministry of  Public Order in combatting drug trafficking and illegal crossing  of the border between the two countries. They expressed  satisfaction over the presence of representatives of Greek  business in Bulgaria. We also talked about peace and stability  in the Balkans, said the Greek minister at the press conference  after the meeting. He said that the opinion of the two sides on  these issue coincided to a great extent.    We believe the interference of non-Balkan factors in the  crisis in the former Yugoslavia to be greatly disturbing and of  a negative impact on the solution of the problems, Papathemelis  said in response to a question. However, we hope that the worst  will be avoided, he said. The launching of the idea about a  Macedonian nation and a Macedonian language is an instrument for  destabilizing the region, the Greek minister said. According to  him, Skopje cannot use this instrument on its own but it could  be used by third, non-Balkan states which may disturb peace in  the Balkans. We would like to believe, Papathemelis said, that  the government of this state will realize where its true  interests lie. I believe that Mr. Kiro Gligorov holds the key  to the successful solution of this problem.    At the talks in the Ministry of the Interior, the Greek side  invited Bulgarian Interior Minister Mikhaylov and a group of  experts to visit Greece and discuss measures in combatting drug  trafficking and strengthening border control, Chief Interior  Ministry Secretary Kosta Bogatsevski told the press conference.</p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Nigeria bans challenges over poll Nigeria's military government issued a decree yesterday barring all courts from hearing cases related to last month's annulment of the country's first presidential election in a decade, Reuter reports from Lagos. The government also issued new laws which repeal aspects of Nigeria's promised return to civilian rule. The Supreme Court adjourned until today its hearing of a suit seeking to reverse the poll's cancellation after lawyers for the government questioned its competence to hear the case.</p>

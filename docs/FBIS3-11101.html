The president said security organizations' and armed forces'  operations to neutralize drug trafficking have not been  effective and advocated more emphasis on legislation better  adapted to reality and on education.    Accompanying Menem were Cicad President Monica Nagel, also  Costa Rica's justice vice minister; Cicad executive secretary  Irving Tragen from the United States; and General Pueyrredon  Mayor Mario Russak. [passage omitted]    Menem said in his message that "security organizations and  the armed forces have tried to neutralize the scourge of drug  trafficking, adding, however, that the results have not been  very encouraging. Each year drug traffickers have more money. It  is known that drug traffickers move more than $6 billion per  year, which is more than the budget of many states."    The president then talked about the need for common  legislation on the matter in all countries in order to become  more efficient. He also mentioned the proposal of those who  think of legalizing consumption and those who propose the  destruction of cultivated areas. The president said: "However,  we must attack the problem at the roots. The problem is one of  education."    The president mentioned that "the average age of people who  start consuming drugs is 11," adding that since the beginning of  his administration the number of beds for treating drug addicts  has increased from 85 to 3,000.    The Cicad meeting, which is being attended by  representatives  from 24 American countries, will continue until 11 March.</p>

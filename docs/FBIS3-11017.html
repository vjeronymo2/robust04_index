De Vargas  disclosed that he held a meeting with Interior Minister Carlos  Podesta on 11 March to ask him for an explanation, but that the  minister told him he knew nothing about it. Now, in view of  this unusual "espionage," the deputies will form a special  commission to carry out an investigation designed to establish  who is responsible for this practice.    In view of the discovery of a small espionage cell  discreetly  established by the police in Congress, according to confirmed  data, the president of the Chamber of Deputies yesterday  announced that tomorrow a commission formed by three deputies  will be established to investigate the reports on espionage made  some days ago.    Yesterday De Vargas confirmed that some days ago legislators  were warned that their steps and visits were being closely  followed by the police who guard the Congress building.  Tomorrow the legislators will start questioning the police  posted in Congress to find out why the National Police were  asking for documents from Congress.    De Vargas explained that "as far as I know, people arriving  at the Chamber of Deputies were checked for safety reasons. But  on Friday afternoon I learned that the police officers made  lists, which were then classified in a list of those who visited  me, those who visited the president of the Senate (Evelio  Fernandez), and another with those who visited the vice  presidents."    "According to the information I obtained, the lists were  then  sent, separately or together, to the office of the chief of  police," said de Vargas.    "Once I learned about this I tried to get in touch with  National Chief of Police (Mario Sapriza) to ask him that this  practice be suspended immediately, if it was in effect being  used. I was not able to find him. I phoned the interior  minister (Carlos Podesta), and told him I had just learned that  the legislators were under surveillance, in the sense that the  names and identity card numbers of our visitors were being  supplied to the chief of police."    De Vargas ended: "I told the minister that if the police  were willing to continue to guard Congress they should do just  that, but if not they should leave and we would hire private  security services."</p>

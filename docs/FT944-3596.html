			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / World Trade News: SKF - Ventures and Contracts SKF, the leading manufacturer of roller bearings, yesterday announced plans to build a factory in China in a joint venture with Shanghai Bearing Corp. The Swedish group will hold 60 per cent of the new company, SKF Automotive Bearings, and invest a total of SKr100m (Dollars 13.3m). The venture expects to supply car makers in China. The new factory will be in Shanghai and should be operational by mid-1995. SKF says the unit should enable its Chinese sales to double from this year's SKr280m by the end of the decade.</p>

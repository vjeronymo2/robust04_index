			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Rosie fights a mean time in Greenwich - Political oblivion stalks south London ROSIE BARNES momentarily drops her dimpled smile: 'I am not the motherhood, apple pie and furry rabbit party. The remark was arrogant and condescending and it will backfire on him.' Such intemperate asides from Mrs Barnes are rare as she bustles from door to door in a heroic attempt to defy the political tide and hold on to Greenwich, the south-east London seat she took for the Social Democratic party in a 1987 by-election and retained months later in the general election. Mrs Barnes was reacting to remarks about her attributed to Mr Nick Raynsford, who achieved his own by-election victory in Fulham in 1986 but proved somewhat less adept than his latest opponent in holding on. Mr Raynsford is trying to regain Greenwich for Labour, backed by a party machine which has appeared efficient and effective across the capital. Mrs Barnes has no party behind her, furry rabbit or otherwise, though she has attracted from around the country the enthusiastic help of those for whom the flame of social democracy still flickers. It may not be much comfort to her but she is not entirely alone in London's 84 parliamentary constituencies in pitching herself against the big battalions of the Labour and Tory parties. Mr John Cartwright, the other surviving SDP 'mould breaker' is defending nearby Woolwich while, further west along the Thames, Mr Simon Hughes is fighting for the Liberal Democrats in Southwark and Bermondsey, held by him since another famous by-election victory in 1983. For all three, the outcome of the general election is particularly uncertain. The psephologists might forecast all three swept away by a resurgence in the fortunes of a Labour party which once regarded London as its own; Barnes, Cartwright and Hughes trust it is not quite as simple as that. Each will be counting heavily on their ability to muster a significant personal vote, built on their record as active constituency MPs who have assiduously carried out local responsibilities. In Woolwich, John Cartwright is 'the man with time for everyone' who has lived locally for 30 years, while Mrs Barnes, after 21 years in Greenwich, has an 'almost intimate' relationship with her constituents. Simon Hughes is '100 per cent dedicated' to Southwark and 'doesn't just work here - he lives here]'. Mrs Barnes may be nearest to the brink of political oblivion. A swing to Labour of less than 3 per cent will be sufficient to see her off. She reckons the absence of any party label could knock 10 per cent off her potential vote but, against that, she is not being opposed by a Liberal Democrat rival and intends to tap for all it is worth an obvious fund of goodwill among local voters. Her posters are everywhere and she is quickly recognised on run-down council estates once the exclusive preserve of Labour. She appears to have involved herself in the problems of countless individual voters, whether bed-bound pensioners or ex-convicts in need of accommodation. Accordingly, her critics dismiss her as a glorified social worker, a description she partly accepts, before emphasising the added value of a seat in the Commons. If she wins, it will be an extraordinary tribute to her grassroots diligence. Though an even smaller swing to Labour will dislodge Mr Cartwright in favour of Mr John Austin-Walker, Labour's candidate, he may have a better chance of survival. His reputation is high and, like Mrs Barnes, he effectively capitalises on evident discontent over the record of the local Labour council, of which Mr Austin-Walker, a race equality officer, is a former leader. National issues take second place or are translated into the particular problems of Woolwich. He accuses the leftwing council of imposing, because of its ineptitude, crippling increases in the cost of meals and home helps which will wipe out the benefit of any pension increases pledged by a Labour party oozing moderation at national level. While Mr Austin-Walker concentrates on unemployment, training and education, Mr Cartwright complains of dirty pavements, closed libraries and swimming pools and calls on 'wise Tories' to back him in a seat which the Conservatives have not won in more than 70 years. He has the personal endorsement of Dr David Owen, the former SDP leader - not necessarily a helpful gesture - and could take the Liberal Democrat whip in the Commons if he wins again. In Southwark, Mr Hughes mixes a careful blend of parochial and parliamentary issues. He is portrayed both as the caring, local boy with more than 10,000 cases on his books and as a politician with a national profile gained by the demands put upon individual MPs in a small Westminster party. Mr Paddy Ashdown, his leader, has been seen in the constituency more than once. He holds a majority of 2,779 over Labour, represented by Mr Richard Balfe, the MEP and former leading light in the old Greater London Council who once sought selection in Greenwich. Mr Hughes, too, is exploiting disenchantment with the Labour council and fights on issues such as street lighting and pensioners' bus passes, while simultaneously pushing the party line on national issues. The biggest issue, according to a constituency worker, is 'housing, housing and housing'. Mr Hughes should survive, though all three London candidates defending seats not already claimed by the two main parties at least face the possibility of seeing years of constituency work come to naught in the wake of national forces beyond their control. All will hope that the capital is big enough to give them another crack of the whip.</p>

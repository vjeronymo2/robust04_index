			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / WEU urged to intervene in Bosnia conflict WESTERN European countries should take more effective military measures to deal with the Bosnian crisis, Mr Wim Van Eekelen, secretary-general of the Western European Union, said yesterday. The measures should include establishment of 'safe havens' for the Moslem population of Bosnia, as western allies had done for Kurds in northern Iraq, and the provision of military air cover for aid convoys. At a final press conference in London before the 10-nation defence organisation moves its headquarters to Brussels next month, Mr Van Eekelen said the UN operation in Bosnia had probably reached its limits, as far as peace-keeping was concerned. He did not think either China or Russia would agree to UN military involvement in Bosnia beyond its present task of providing protection for humanitarian aid convoys. That was why he believed the European countries should take a lead, if necessary outside the UN context. Mr van Eekelen recognised the reluctance of all countries to become heavily engaged with ground forces in the former Yugoslavia. But the European countries should set themselves more limited objectives and then make sure that they were attained, which was not the case at present. 'Military measures are sometimes necessary to achieve political objectives,' he said. 'Our credibility is zero politically because we are just not doing anything.' Mr van Eekelen said that while the joint Nato-WEU naval blockade in the Adriatic had been successful in preventing supplies reaching Serbia and Montenegro by sea, much tighter controls had to be imposed to prevent sanctions-busting on the Danube. Aircraft should be provided to protect aid convoys and should be authorised to fire back if a convoy was attacked or remove obstacles in its way. Mr van Eekelen said a more dynamic and independent European defence posture was necessary with the withdrawal of US troops from Europe. Though he hoped some American forces would stay, the only chance of preserving Nato as a viable organisation was to transform it into a genuine two-pillar alliance. It was no longer just a question of burden-sharing, but of a more equal partnership.</p>

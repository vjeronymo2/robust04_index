			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Dark horse joins the race: The shape of Lloyds Bank if it succeeds in taking over Midland When Mr Brian Pitman became chief executive of Lloyds Bank in 1983, he asked his senior colleagues whether the bank was successful. Without exception they said that it was. 'Research showed we had happy staff and happy customers,' he says. But Mr Pitman was not satisfied: 'The stock market was saying something completely different. Lloyds' shares were priced at only 50 per cent of the value of assets.' In other words, investors were saying that Lloyds  - like all other banks at the time  - was relatively inept at managing its assets. Thereafter, Lloyds became the first big UK bank to be managed primarily for the benefit of its shareholders  - which Mr Pitman believes is in the interest of employees and customers as well. Unlike its rivals, Lloyds became ruthless at pulling out of businesses making a low return, and began to cut costs. In 1991 alone, Lloyds cut Pounds 150m from its staff costs by reducing its headcount by 8,500. Thus Lloyds' attempt to take over Midland is aimed at pushing up profits by cutting costs. 'By integrating the two businesses, Lloyds Bank envisages it could reduce the enlarged group's operating costs by over Pounds 700m within four years of the merger,' it said yesterday. This focus on productivity is in stark contrast to the pronouncements of most other banks when making takeover bids. Banks traditionally believe that big is beautiful and promote their takeover attempts by pointing to the benefits of expanding the network of offices. Never before has a UK clearing bank attempted to acquire a UK rival against the rival's will. This has been the message of Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation, which made a formal takeover offer for Midland a fortnight ago. The logic of its offer is that it creates 'a strong international banking group with a worldwide network . . . operating in the world's three major economic regions'. Because Hongkong Bank has a relatively modest presence in the UK, it has little scope to improve profits by cutting operations which overlap with those of Midland. Lloyds has much more scope for such gains. Mr Pitman says the Pounds 700m savings arising from the planned takeover of Midland should be achieved relatively easily  - and may be exceeded. He also talks confidently of increasing Midland's income. The most obvious way of pushing up profits at Midland would be for Lloyds' life insurance subsidiary, Abbey Life, to sell its products to Midland's customers. Mr Pitman says that last year 14 per cent of all Lloyds customers who bought any life insurance at all bought their policies from Lloyds Abbey Life  - far higher than the percentage of Midland customers buying their insurance from Midland. Persuading Midland customers to buy Lloyds Abbey Life products could bring in many tens of million pounds of extra profit over the next few years. But in the short term Lloyds' emphasis would be on cost savings, which would be made by reorganising three different parts of the combined banks' activities: Overlapping elements of head office functions and centralised services - such as foreign exchange and money market dealing  - would be eliminated. A single computer network would be operated for the enlarged operation. Where Lloyds and Midland have adjacent branches, one of the branches would be closed. Over four years Lloyds would expect to shed 20,000 employees from the combined banks' worldwide staff of 125,500, with the bulk of the job losses occurring in the UK. The banking union, Bifu, is concerned this would involve huge numbers of forced redundancies. But Mr Pitman says 'forced redundancies are very unlikely . . . Many of those jobs will go through natural wastage. The rest are likely to accept voluntary severance.' To cover these severance costs, Lloyds would make a provision of Pounds 300m before tax out of reorganisation costs totalling Pounds 550m. The greatest source of long-term cost savings, about half of the Pounds 700m, should come from reorganising the branch network. Mr Pitman says some 1,000 branches would close over four years. 'Where there are overlapping branches, we will close the weaker branch,' he says. 'That may mean closing a Lloyds branch rather than a Midland one.' Sir Jeremy Morse, Lloyds chairman, says this equity of treatment between the two banks' branches has been spelled out clearly to Lloyds employees. Mr Pitman insists customers will benefit from an orderly re-organisation of this sort rather than the more haphazard restructuring of the industry which is currently taking place: 'I believe that over the next decade around 10,000 bank and building society branches in the UK, out of the total number of 20,000, will close. That will involve the loss of 50,000 jobs.' Sir Jeremy argues that the way the cuts fall can hurt customers. There are some villages and towns which now have no bank branches at all, he says, where until recently each clearing bank had a branch. 'Everyone pulled out at the same time, where in fact it would have been better for customers if one of us had stayed behind,' he says. His argument is that Lloyds and Midland as independent banks would close down just as many branches over the next few years as the 1,000 planned by Lloyds if it buys Midland. The difference is that if Lloyds succeeds with its bid, it would continue to be represented in all areas where the two banks are represented. Only overlapping branches would be closed. Nonetheless, Lloyds and Midland customers in some parts of the country would experience disruption to service. Each bank has large numbers of banks in the Midlands  - both Lloyds and Midland were founded in Birmingham  - and in South Wales, so closures will be greatest in these regions. The two banks are a good match in terms of the regional distribution of branches, with Lloyds stronger in the south and Midland in the north. Earlier in the 20th century, Lloyds concentrated its expansion on the south and south west, by buying the Wilts and Dorset Bank in 1914 and Capital and Counties Bank in 1918. Midland by contrast grew in Britain's industrial heartland. But branch closure is not the only inconvenience to be faced by Midland's 3.6m current account holders. They would be asked to give up their Midland cheque books and plastic cards for Lloyds ones. However, Lloyds would abandon only the 'Midland' brand name. Other marques  -such as the First Direct brand used by Midland's branchless banking subsidiary and Samuel Montagu, the name of its merchant bank  - would be kept. Both banks' big corporate customers are indifferent to the prospect of Midland being bought by Lloyds. Big companies' closest relationships tend to be with National Westminster and Barclays, rather than with Midland and Lloyds. For services or loans, big groups shop around at the big international banks too. However, there is one group of the banks' customers, small and medium size businesses, which is more concerned about the implications of such a deal. Though there are a dozen financial institutions providing loans to such businesses, this market is dominated by the four English clearing banks. According to industry sources, NatWest has about 28 per cent of this market, Barclays 27 per cent, Lloyds 15 per cent and Midland 14 per cent. Small businesses fear that the combination of Lloyds and Midland would be bad for competition. Mr Pitman claims the opposite is true. 'We would for the first time be on an equal footing with NatWest and Barclays,' he says. 'We would compete more effectively.' He also points out that in most European countries, banking markets are dominated by just two or perhaps three banks, rather than four as in the UK. LLoyds may be able to go some way to reassuring small business customers and personal clients that they will enjoy benefits from a Midland takeover. Mr Pitman says in the coming weeks Lloyds will offer new products and services unavailable elsewhere, to its and Midland's customers, conditional on the deal going through. The aim would be to prove that some of the extra profits generated from buying Midland would be recycled into improving services to customers. In this way, Lloyds also hopes to persuade the UK and Brussels competition authorities that a Midland takeover is in the public interest. Lloyds has made it explicit that it regards the competition authorities as the main obstacle to such a takeover. Though it has said how much it would offer for each Midland share  - one of its own shares plus 30p  - it also said it would not offer this formally until one of two preconditions has been met: Either it must be satisfied that its bid will not be referred for investigation by the UK competition authority, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission; Or if its bid is referred to the monopolies commission, then the rival offer from Hongkong Bank should also be referred. What it wants, in Sir Jeremy's words, is 'a level playing field' in its fight against Hongkong Bank. If its bid went to the monopolies commission but Hongkong Bank's did not, Midland's shareholders would have to choose between accepting an immediate offer from Hongkong Bank or waiting between three and six months for the outcome of the commission's investigation. Lloyds fears that under such circumstances, shareholders would take the immediately available offer. Staff of the Office of Fair Trading, which would advise the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) on whether to refer a bid to the monopolies commission, say the Lloyds' bid will almost certainly be referred. This means, they say, that Lloyds' only hope is that the Hongkong Bank bid is referred to the commission as well. The likelihood of such a reference is difficult to assess. First, the Brussels competition authorities need to be persuaded that the Hongkong bid falls outside their jurisdiction. Then, Lloyds needs to persuade the OFT and the DTI that there are grounds for a reference of the Hongkong bid to the commission. Lloyds privately admits that this will be a challenge. Still, the potential gains from a successful bid for Midland justify the efforts involved. Mr Pitman's strategy of building Lloyds' profits by shrinking the bank has worked very successfully; but it cannot continue indefinitely. To keep its profits growing, Lloyds needs fresh costs to cut. Midland offers the best place to find them  - and therefore the best opportunity of keeping Lloyds' shareholders happy.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKET SHARE IN EACH SECTOR  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Lloyds              Midland                             Percentage share of sector  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Retail                       13.0                 12.9 Wholesale                    14.2                 13.5 Construction                 14.1                 13.3 Manufacturing                14.6                 14.5 Transport                    14.4                 13.2 Services                     15.0                 12.4 Finance &amp; property           12.9                 12.2 Agriculture                  14.6                 14.7 Mining                       10.4                  9.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Dun &amp; Bradstreet  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

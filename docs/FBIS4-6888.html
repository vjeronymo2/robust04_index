			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Unreasonable Demand Cannot Be Met" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, April 25 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  brands the demand of the United States and the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] for the DPRK's full compliance with  the safeguards agreement, which was contained in a "presidential  statement" of the U.N. Security Council, as unjustifiable and  unreasonable.    The news analyst says:    Their demand ignoring the DPRK's unique status following the  temporary suspension of the effectuation of its announced  withdrawal from the Non-proliferation Treaty shows they are  trying to deny the unique status of the DPRK and use the  safeguards agreement as an experient for the sinister political  purpose of stifling it.    We cannot fully comply with the safeguards agreement, even  if  we try before the United States and the IAEA prove in practice  that they are not going to stifle the DPRK.    So long as the United States refuses to stop the anti-DPRK  campaign and its nuclear threat and the IAEA Secretariat fails  to renounce its partiality, we cannot allow inspection  activities tantamount to routine and ad hoc inspections.    It is self-evident that if we allow such inspection  activities while the IAEA is escalating its partiality,  dishonest officials of the IAEA Secretariat will join-more  zealously in the U.S. policy of stifling the DPRK, groundlessly  charging us with the possession of something which we do not  have, and reversing black and white.    When the United States and the IAEA Secretariat respect our  unique status, the nuclear issue will be settled smoothly.    How long our unique status lasts depends on the behavior of  the United States and the IAEA Secretariat.    Pressure cannot be a solution to the problem.    It is our consistent position to resolve the nuclear issue  peacefully through dialogue and negotiation.    It is entirely up to the United States and the IAEA  Secretariat how the situation will develop.</p>

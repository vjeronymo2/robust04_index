			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAY IT AIN'T SO, BOYD  </P> <P> Regarding the passage in the July 24 article on former brokerage house chief  Boyd L. Jefferies ("Boyd Jefferies in Exile") teaching youths to play golf,  please tell me the following quote was a misprint:  </P> <P> "We are doing a darn good job of making potential citizens out of them."  </P> <P> Does he really mean to imply that learning the rules of golf will elevate the  learner from a born citizen to a "potential citizen?"  </P> <P> And this from a guy who wasn't born into wealth?  </P> <P> R. L. HANNEGAN  </P> <P> Lake Havasu City, Ariz.  </P></p>

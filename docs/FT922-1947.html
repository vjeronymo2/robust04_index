			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Tokyo enacts financial sector reforms BARRIERS between Japan's banking and securities business are to be lowered following legislative reform yesterday allowing banks and securities houses to enter each other's businesses. While banks will not be allowed to enter broking - partly because of strong opposition from the securities industry - the legislative changes symbolise an end to prolonged debate over financial sector reforms. They come at a tough time for Japanese financial institutions, following sharp falls in the stock and real estate markets. While banks are considering establishing securities subsidiaries specialising in underwriting as early as next year, brokers, facing severe downturn in profits, are unlikely to have the financial strength to enter the banking arena. The reform bills also include the establishment of a financial markets watchdog next month. It is to be headed by Mr Toshihiro Mizuhara, superintendent public prosecutor of the Nagoya High Public Prosecutor's Office. The House of Councillors also passed revisions of the Loan Business Law, which will increase the Finance Ministry's grip on non-bank financial institutions. Meanwhile, the Japanese insurance industry has presented an advisory report to the Finance Ministry pressing for deregulation Deregulation of life and non-life insurance has lagged behind liberalisation in broking and securities. Insurance companies also want to enter banking and broking, and are keen to acquire a share of the lucrative underwriting business. The report also recommends the easing of barriers between life and non-life industries, where both parties can sell accident, illness and nursing insurances. Proposals for legislative changes are expected to be presented during the ordinary session of parliament in 1994. Although the reforms could be implemented as early as 1995, industry officials are sceptical of an early implementation.</p>

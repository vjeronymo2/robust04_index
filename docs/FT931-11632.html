			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / How banks can dodge obstacles to a 'warm sell': The data protection registrar's growing concern DISCLOSURE of Mr Norman Lamont's credit card details in The Sun in December was a temporary embarrassment for National Westminster Bank, which issued the card. But banks may regret for a long time having interested the data protection registrar in how they use personal customer information on databases. Mr John Lamidey, assistant registrar with responsibility for financial services, has become worried by several aspects of how banks use customer data. He believes they may not only be evading their own code of practice introduced last March, but could also be breaking the 1984 Data Protection Act. Mr Lamidey's intervention on behalf of Mr Eric Howe, the data protection registrar, comes at an awkward time for banks. They have grown increasingly interested in using the details they hold about customers' current and savings accounts to sell them other products from insurance to holidays. This is becoming more important for high street banks as they try to raise other forms of income to compensate for losses on bad lending in the late 1980s. Banks are making large investments in insurance subsidiaries in the hope of being able to 'warm sell' to existing customers. The potential conflict between confidentiality of customer information and banks' efforts to sell a wider variety of products was recognised in the code of practice adopted by the banks. This says banks and building societies will observe 'a strict duty of confidentiality'. Specifically, the code says that banks will not disclose details of accounts or names and addresses to third parties - including other companies within the group - except in tightly controlled circumstances. One is where disclosure is made 'at the request, or with the consent, of the customer'. Banks have paid less attention until now to the fact that the Data Protection Act also imposes controls. This is likely to become more important as banks make use of 'relational databases' which calculate from personal and account details what sort of products might interest a customer. The eight 'data protection principles' say that companies should take 'appropriate security measures' to protect the data they collect and should also obtain and process data 'fairly and lawfully'. Mr Lamidey has started to question whether they are complying with the second requirement. The situation was summed up neatly in a recent report by Smith New Court, the firm of stockbrokers, which pointed out that the code was 'an obstacle' for Black Horse Financial Services - Lloyds Bank's insurance sales subsidiary. Mr Lamidey is worried about two ways around the 'obstacle'. The first is that while banks may not directly disclose names and addresses of customers who they think are interested in insurance to their own subsidiary, they may send out a mail shot on behalf of the subsidiary to each customer. The second is that banks may make it difficult for customers to avoid giving consent to the broad use of data by asking them to sign their consent as a condition of getting a particular financial service. He cites a clause now inserted in forms for Barclays products such as Barclaycard and Barclays Holiday Club. Mr Lamidey thinks that a bank may not be obtaining data fairly if it makes the wider use of data a condition of gaining a service. It may not even be acting fairly if it makes it hard for the customer to refuse consent for other uses - for example by insisting on a separate letter. An example of what concerns him is Barclays' application form for a personal loan. It gives the bank permission to use all customer details on its central information system unless the customer writes a separate letter to his or her own branch giving account details. Lloyds Bank wrote to all customers earlier this year asking them to give express consent for names and addresses to be passed on to its sales subsidiaries. But application forms for some products now tell people that they will be sent other marketing material - without a choice being offered. Mr Lamidey wants to meet banks to discuss such issues. Whatever the outcome, it is clear that in future banks are likely to face far wider monitoring of how they use data. Mr Lamidey is already asking questions about whether customers of telephone banks are adequately protected.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Kalyadina report: "Minister Happy, Wife </F> `Concerned'"]    [Text] Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias' three-day  visit to the Russian capital is taking place, as we used to say,  in an atmosphere of total mutual understanding. And this is by  no means journalistic affectation on my part, but literally the  opinion that the Greek visitor and his Russian counterpart A.  Kozyrev voiced after their talks yesterday. The said  understanding has been observed on a whole range of issues.    In particular, we are demonstrating total unity of views on  the problem of a Yugoslav settlement. And this unity presumably  enabled the two ministers, by the Russian foreign minister's  admission, to outline a number of future steps in this noble  work.    Andrey Kozyrev and Karolos Papoulias were both happy with  the  way in which economic ties are developing between Russia and  Greece. Admittedly, I would like to add on behalf of the  representatives of big business with whom I spoke: We are still  a long way from perfection since we still prefer the  wide-ranging barter of furs and citrus fruits to wide-ranging  cooperation in major spheres. But it is a source of joy that  "we have the political will" to achieve this perfection (I am  again quoting Andrey Vladimirovich).    However, we (Russia) are particularly delighted by the fact  that Greece, currently president of the European Union [EU], has  kept the promise that it made on taking up office and has, where  possible, promoted rapprochement between our fatherland and the  EU. Minister Kozyrev thanked the Greek Government for this  support. After which he intrigued the journalists at the press  conference by admitting that "there may be major events in this  sphere" shortly.    Journalists were naturally interested as to what events  these  might be. Since before he left for Moscow in an interview with  ITAR-TASS Karolos Papoulias spoke of the possible signing of a  partnership agreement between the EU and Russia -- during the EU  leaders' coming meeting on the Greek island of Corfu.  Nevertheless Andrey Vladimirovich did not satisfy my  colleagues' interest. And instead of providing a concrete  answer said that this summer children from the North of Russia  will be going to Greece for a vacation "due to" Greek charity.  Evidently in order to ease our disappointment he revealed a  family secret: His wife, who is head of the "Concern" [Zabota]  Children's Fund, is in charge of sending the children.</p>

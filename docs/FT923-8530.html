			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Army experts fearful of sending troops to Yugoslavia WESTERN military experts remain deeply unhappy about becoming involved in former Yugoslavia even though Nato officials yesterday got the go-ahead to draw up contingency plans aimed at sending troops to protect humanitarian relief convoys in Bosnia-Hercegovina, 'However much public opinion is forcing us to take the military option, any Nato involvement will have a very high financial cost,' a Nato diplomat said. 'It could have a high cost in human terms as well,' he said. It would require at least 50,000 troops to open up two relief corridors into the former Yugoslav republic, he said. 'Because of these large numbers, we have repeatedly asked western leaders about what objectives they want to achieve if they go in.' In terms of the financial cost, experts working with Nato believe that for every one soldier sent to Bosnia - to support the humanitarian relief effort  -it would require the back-up of at least three more people. 'Sending in troops is one thing. But you have to back them up with food, communications, medicine, equipment, supplies, transport. Who is going to pay for this? Where are we going to get the troops from -if we decide to use ground forces to protect the humanitarian relief convoys. It is going to take a long time to get them stationed in Bosnia, if that is what we will be pushed into doing,' another Nato diplomat said. He also argued that Nato was simply not prepared for such an operation, even though the organisation is currently seeking to create a rapid-deployment force. 'For the past forty years, we were trained to defend Europe. We knew the terrain. Our facilities were there. We knew what the aims of defending Europe were. 'In the case of Bosnia, whether you accept it or not, we are entering enemy territory. We don't know where we can place our supplies and reinforcements. We have to be clear what we want out of this whole operation,' he said. Military experts, including United Nations officials, also worry about the future status of the UN peace-keeping forces both in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, and in Croatia. 'If you go in under the aegis of the UN, what happens to the UN peace-keepers on the ground? They will not be seen as impartial, said Brigadier Kenneth Hunt, a former RAF staff officer at Nato and vice-president of the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. Brigadier Hunt argued that there was little point in sending in a small force to protect the relief convoys. 'This has got to be a serious policy of saturation, otherwise it will be meaningless, and a disaster.' 'Personally, I would opt for establishing safe havens for the refugees, and some form of air power. I would not embark on mounting an operation to protect the convoys,' said Brigadier Hunt. Mr Willem van Eekelen, secretary general of the Western European Union (WEU), the fledgeling defence arm of the European Community, agreed that safe havens should be established for the refugees - but within Bosnia and 'before the Serbs grab even more land,' he said. These havens should be protected by the WEU, while sanctions against Serbia should be stepped up, by land and sea, with powers by individual countries to search vessels. 'We have to do something. The alternative is worse. The war could spread to the rest of the Balkans,' he said.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Mass Greek protest over name of new republic of Macedonia SEVERAL hundred thousand Greeks yesterday demonstrated in the northern city of Salonica against the use of the name Macedonia by the breakaway Yugoslav republic, Greece's northern neighbour. The demonstration coincided with suggestions that the European Community may soon recognise Macedonia as an independent republic. Mr Dinos Kosmopoulos, the mayor of Salonica, capital of the Greek province of Macedonia, said the emerging republic (of Macedonia) had 'challenged our history and stolen our name.' Greece refuses to recognise the Macedonian republic's independence unless it changes its name and gives guarantees that it has no territorial claim on northern Greece. However, there is increasing speculation that if other western countries recognise Macedonia, the Greek government will drop its opposition to the name providing Macedonia denies the existence of a Slavo-Macedonian minority in Greece. Meanwhile, in Macedonia itself, the Yugoslav federal army continues to withdraw its forces from the republic. David White, Defence Correspondent, adds: The UK is discussing sending specialised support units to Yugoslavia for the planned UN peacekeeping force, but is resisting involvement by British combat troops. Its reluctance is based on fears that the plan may become a long-standing commitment such as the UN force that has been in Cyprus since 1964 or Britain's own engagement in Northern Ireland since 1969. However, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, yesterday expressed Britain's 'full support' for the plan and urged 'swift UN involvement'. The shape of the force of up to 13,000 is expected to be worked out early next week after talks involving 31 countries. Britain's contribution is likely to focus on areas such as portable satellite communications and engineering units. But experts believe it may involve fewer than the 1,200 personnel suggested by the UN.</p>

The right-wing station's license  would have expired at midnight tonight, but has been extended  until the 11th of January. Karen Mugglestone-Melville reports:    Station manager Chris Conradie said the Department of Home  Affairs had telephonically extended their license this evening.  This followed an inconclusive meeting at the World Trade Center  in Kempton Park today to resolve the issue. Members of the  Afrikaner Kultuurbond [Culture League] met with home affairs  officials to discuss the temporary license. The party included  AVF [Afrikaner National Front] leader Constand Viljoen and CP  [Conservative Party] leader Ferdi Hartzenberg. [passage omitted]</p>

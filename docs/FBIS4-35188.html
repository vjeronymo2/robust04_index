			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Tunis, 29 May (MENA) -- The Palestinian National  Authority Council last night wound up three days of meetings  under Council Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, during which it appointed  ministers for the National Authority and approved the  Authority's program for the coming period.    Dr. Samir Ghawshah, council member and minister of labor and  workers, said in the next few days 'Arafat will hold  consultations with Palestinian groups to complete the formation  of the council by appointing five more members. Thus, the  members of the council will total 25, including 'Arafat.    Dr. Ghawshah said 'Arafat will hold consultations with the  various Palestinian forces to complete the appointment of  ministers from among the council members. Fifteen ministers  were appointed yesterday. Seven other ministries remain vacant,  including the Interior Ministry, which will be taken over by  'Arafat himself so he can directly supervise the Palestinian  police and security forces. The Information Ministry remains  vacant after Hanan 'Ashrawi, former spokeswoman of the  Palestinian negotiating delegations, declined to take up that  post. [passage omitted]</p>

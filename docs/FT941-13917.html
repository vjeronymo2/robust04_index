			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Investing while abroad I plan to go to Singapore for two years to work full-time. I intend to return to the UK at the end of the contract. I wish to leave my building society deposits and equity investments in the UK, except that I will ask for the interest on the former to be paid gross. I do not plan the income from these investments to be remitted to Singapore so that (as I understand) this income is not taxable there. 1) How will the tax on the interest income be calculated for the three years? 2) Shall I be able to reclaim the tax credit on the dividend income received during these years? If so, at what rate? 3) Is CGT payable on disposals of my present investments if they are made during my absence abroad but before April 5, 1996? 4) Am I eligible to make PEP investment in full for the tax years of my departure and return? 5) Would my non-resident status and / or my liability for tax on foreign and UK income be affected if I retain the directorship of a UK company? 1) The interest will be fully taxable in the UK, subject to your personal allowance. It is doubtful whether you will be able to arrange for it to be paid without deduction of tax; if you do, your tax credit payments for 1995-96 will be restricted accordingly, as explained in concession B13 in the free booklet of extrastatutory concessions, IR1. If the interest is subject to tax in Singapore, the rate of UK tax for the period of your residence in Singapore may be limited to 15 per cent, by virtue of article 7A of the Singapore-UK double taxation agreement (as amended in 1977). 2) To the extent that your personal allowance for 1995-96 exceeds your UK interest, you will be entitled to tax credit payments at 20 per cent (on the aggregate of the relevant dividends and their tax credits). If the dividends are subject to Singapore tax, you may be entitled to tax credit payments at a minimum rate of 5 per cent (on the aggregate) for the period of your residence in Singapore. 3) It is possible that you will be exempt from CGT in respect of sale contracts made in 1995-96, either because you will be regarded as neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the UK for that year, or by virtue of article 9 of the double taxation agreement: 'A resident of one of the Contracting States who does not carry on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein shall be exempt in that other Contracting State from any tax on gains from the sale, transfer or exchange of capital assets.' However, you have not given us enough precise data for a firm opinion, so you should seek local professional guidance if the amounts of tax are large enough to justify the expense. 4) Yes. Ask your tax office for pamphlet IR89 (personal equity plans). 5) Unless you remained outside the UK for the whole of 1995-96, you would probably be regarded as resident and ordinarily resident in the UK for that year, as well as for the years either side of it. Everything would then depend upon the dual-residents' tiebreaking article: 2(1)(g)(ii). You should find the text of the Singapore-UK double taxation agreement (as amended) in volume 2 of the British International Tax Agreements, volume 6 of the British Tax Encyclopedia, Butterworths Tax Treaties, or volume F of Simon's Taxes. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

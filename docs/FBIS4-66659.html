			<p>BFN     [Text] The proceedings of the Executive Committee of the  General Union of Algerian Workers [UGTA] opened this morning at  the Palais des Nations, Club des Pins [a conference hall in an  Algiers suburb] to examine and assess the activities of the  union's National Secretariat, prepare for the forthcoming  congress, and adopt a decisive position on the country's current  situation. Over to Mahfoud Mennane with the following dispatch:    The proceedings were opened by the union's secretary  general,  Mr. Abdelhak Benhamouda, who touched on several topics,  including those relating to organizational and legislative  matters and to the preparations for the union's forthcoming  congress. In his opening address, Mr. Benhamouda talked about  several issues, including the current political and economic  situation in the country and the pressures to which the union is  being subjected.    Regarding the economic issues, particularly those relating  to  the government's agreement with the IMF, the leader of the trade  union expressed his dissatisfaction with this agreement, for as  he put it, it will have negative repercussions on the working  class in our country. He added that the trade union had not  been informed beforehand about what was going on during the  negotiations with the IMF.    As regards the negotiations between the trade union and the  government, Mr. Benhamouda said that the union had made enormous  efforts to clinch some of the workers' rights. He added that  what has been achieved is the minimum until the file of wages is  opened. During this meeting, Mr. Benhamouda expressed the trade  union's fear for the workers' future in view of the trend  towards privatization. In this respect, he had this to say:    [Begin Benhamouda recording] There are many Algerians who  say  -- even just from an economic point of view for we must talk  about economic efficiency -- that if you hit the public sector  now the crisis will deepen and will not be resolved. Why?  Because the Algerian economy depends, for 70 percent, on the  public sector. Therefore one cannot destroy or hit 70 percent to  depend on the remaining 30 percent. Furthermore, these 30  percent also depend on these 70 percent. [end recording]    It is worth indicating that at this very moment the  proceedings are being held behind closed doors.</p>

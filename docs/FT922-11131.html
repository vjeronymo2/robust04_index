			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Technology: Put yourself on the map - Dave Madden explains how geographical information can be brought to life Imagine letting your automobile find the nearest car park for you. It will know if there is enough space available in the facility and if the route is congested it will plot you another. Improbable? Not according to Britain's Automobile Association. The AA is already operating a pilot project with Ford using this sort of in-car navigation system around Basildon in Essex. Ralph Robbins, the AA's chief cartographer, envisages supplying traffic routing data from the AA's Road Watch information service by radio channel to vehicle navigation computers. Geographical information systems (GIS), which bring maps to life on a computer screen, display corporate information visually. Cellular radio networks, sewage systems and Tube tunnels are all possibilities. Public utilities, embarrassed by digging up one another's assets, were first to use such systems in the UK. But the retail and transport industries are as likely to exploit its possibilities as users with miles of physical infrastructure to locate. While the same could have been said five years ago, the signs are that GIS is much closer to taking off today. UK retailers - led by Marks &amp; Spencer, Tesco and Sainsbury - and financial services groups are able to build new profiles of their customers and create store and branch location analysis tools. Retailers have been surprised by what GIS has shown them. It has made them reassess things which they either thought they knew or believed did not matter, such as how far different sets of customers are willing to travel to shop in different parts of the country. M&amp;S implemented a GIS system a year ago which allows it to map its own data on to external demographic, socio-economic and drive-time statistics. For retailers, says Simon Orebi Gann, M&amp;S's IT executive, GIS has more to do with extracting meaning from these databases than with drawing pictures. 'The retail trade may not be the first to use a technology, but it is good at making more of it than people have down previously,' says Orebi Gann. Ultimately, he adds, GIS is helping retailers to improve their customer service performance, allowing them to treat customers with greater individuality. The AA is also a fair barometer. According to Robbins, the GIS underpinning the AA's command and control system can locate stranded vehicles and provide a decision support system for the despatchers. But the AA is not just a user. It has turned its GIS investment into a business opportunity as a supplier of geographical information via its distributor Kingswood. Its experience also highlights the basic obstacle to GIS - the cost. 'The data is the problem. These systems make no sense without it and until recently hardware and software vendors did not want to recognise it,' Robbins says. It is this issue which confronts the utilities. BT embarked on one of the UK's most ambitious GIS efforts in 1988 - to computerise its overhead lines and underground ducts. But the company abandoned the project and decided to concentrate on its local network. Currently it is out to tender again, for GIS hardware and software, with a view to beginning a new pilot in 1993. Those close to the project believe that it was the data capture element which scuppered BT's first attempt. Roger Morgan, GIS development project manager at Thames Water, puts this experience into context. Thames has a statutory obligation to map its 30,000km of water mains and 80,000km of sewers by 1999. It will have digitised the clean water network by 1995. But the sewers, inherited from local authorities with often poor records, will take three years longer. According to Morgan, if Thames is going to make such a big investment then it is determined to make the system work. That means the GIS will have to communicate with other corporate databases - job and asset management systems, even billing systems. It will fuel Thames's whole operational and customer service approach. This sort of integration of diverse systems and databases is beginning to make sense economically. Rather than just describing an infrastructure, GIS must now become a means of analysing and managing it - from pretty pictures to squeezing value from the data. Andrew Wolfe, managing director of Eurecart, the GIS software arm of French services group Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez, argues that as well as maximising the impact of GIS, integration will also minimise the traditional data capture effort. The company's object-oriented software, which promises faster, more efficient programming, helps users to combine conventional databases. 'It lets them use the data wherever it is now, and simply adds a layer of graphic reference and symbol.' Wolfe's technique is demonstrated in one of the most all-embracing GIS projects yet seen in Europe - an urban reference system for the city of Lyon, France and its environs. The system is now at the heart of Lyon's city government - from managing its parks and gardens to analysing the effect of roadworks on traffic flow in the city centre. Eventually the system will manage traffic lights automatically and feed the information into the route planning devices in private cars. Today Lyon, tomorrow Basildon.</p>

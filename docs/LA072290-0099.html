			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROSENFIELD ON ENFORCING AUTO INSURANCE ROLLBACKS  </P> <P> Rosenfield's column was on target, but his time frame for change is still too  tolerant of the insurance pirates. We can't wait one, two, or 20 more years for  insurance reform.  </P> <P> As drivers in California, we are offered the choice of either lining the  pockets of these greedy bozos or breaking the law. The "peoples'  representatives" in Sacramento must move immediately to establish a California  Non-Profit Insurance Fund so that we don't have to make this choice. Otherwise,  mass civil disobedience will be our only alternative.  </P> <P> If government requires us to carry auto insurance, government must make it  affordable and responsive to our needs -- or else we as drivers and consumers  must refuse to be squeezed between the law and the insurers.  </P> <P> DAVID G. SKAUGERUD  </P> <P> Topanga  </P></p>

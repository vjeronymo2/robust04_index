			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DEFENSE-FRAUD PROBE TARGET RETIRES FROM CUBIC CORP.  </P> <P> Cubic Corp. executive Colvin C. (Sam) Wellborn, whose offices were searched by  the FBI in the government's continuing investigation into defense procurement  fraud, Friday retired after 32 years with Cubic.  </P> <P> Cubic has acknowledged that Wellborn, 56, is a target of the "Ill Wind" fraud  investigation that has touched several government employees and executives at  nearly 30 defense-contracting firms.  </P> <P> Seven federal agents took a 6-inch stack of documents from Wellborn's San Diego  office after a six-hour search last June. Wellborn and several other Cubic  employees since have been subpoenaed, evidently as part of an investigation  into the "Top Gun" air combat training systems that account for the bulk of  Cubic's Defense Department contracts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Still Targets  </P> <P> Joseph J. Aronica, an assistant U. S. attorney in Virginia and one of the top  prosecutors in the Ill Wind investigations, said Friday that Cubic and Wellborn  remain targets of the investigation. Aronica declined to say when charges would  be brought, but he described the timing of Wellborn's resignation as "very,  very interesting."  </P> <P> Cubic spokesman Jerry Reeves declined to comment on whether Wellborn's  retirement was related to the Justice Department's investigation.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, two Teledyne Electronics officials were given light  sentences for their part in a scheme to bribe a Navy official to win a  $24-million electronics contract. The two executives were the first defendants  found guilty at trial in the Ill Wind investigation. So far, 14 individuals and  two corporations have confessed to or been found guilty of crimes uncovered in  the three-year inquiry.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Denial Made  </P> <P> Although Cubic Chairman Walter J. Zable has acknowledged that Wellborn is a  target of the investigation, he has denied that the Justice Department  considers Cubic itself to be a target.  </P> <P> According to Justice Department documents released by a federal court in  Maryland, Wellborn allegedly paid a top Air Force civilian official for  illegally obtained information that Cubic subsequently used to pursue at least  three Defense Department contracts. The document alleged that Wellborn and the  Air Force official engaged in "continuing criminal conduct."  </P> <P> In a January letter to employees, Zable argued that Wellborn "deserves respect  for his service, recognition of his rights and support for the presumption of  innocence with which he is clothed."  </P> <P> Wellborn most recently served as a Cubic Corp. senior vice president and as  president of Cubic's Defense Systems subsidiary. He joined Cubic in 1957 as a  design engineer. Cubic Defense Systems accounted for about 42% of Cubic's $364  million in 1988 revenue.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Service Cited  </P> <P> Zable on Friday credited Wellborn with "32 years of dedicated, loyal and  productive service to Cubic. He will be sorely missed."  </P> <P> Separate from the Ill Wind investigation, two Cubic employees are now being  tried in U. S. District Court on charges of defrauding the government in  connection with a contract to produce hand-held mine detectors. They have  pleaded not guilty. Last year, Cubic agreed to pay the Army $7.5 million to  settle a civil complaint against the company in connection with the  mine-detector contract.  </P> <P> A handful of disgruntled shareholders late last year filed a civil suit against  Cubic, alleging fraudulent activity by Cubic executives and officers in  connection with the defense procurement investigation and the mine detector  case.  </P> <P> Times staff writer John Broder in Washington contributed to this story.  </P></p>

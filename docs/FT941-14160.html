			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Kingfisher The creed of everyday low pricing has been preached at length by Sir Geoff Mulcahy, Kingfisher's chairman, over the past couple of years. Yet judging by the company's Christmas trading performance, that particular road to salvation is narrow and rocky. Marks and Spencer is clearly making a success of cutting margins to gain market share and increase overall profits. Kingfisher is making heavier weather of the exercise. Those companies which have applied the formula in the US have not just relied on price. They usually have a very strong market position, a reputation for service, modern retail information systems networks and high-tech distribution networks. M&amp;S fits this bill nicely, but Kingfisher's chains lag in several important respects. In B&amp;Q, there are some signs that everyday low pricing is working. But Comet struggles behind Dixons and arguably the service element is lacking in both chains. Boots dominates Superdrug's market to the extent that it is well placed to turn the screw of lower margins against Superdrug. Woolworth is only now getting the electronic point-of-sale equipment it needs. In part, that may be a matter of timing, since Kingfisher has hired Mr Alan Smith from M&amp;S to provide many of these skills. Kingfisher equally argues that it has to start somewhere. Shareholders may find, however, that the profits of the strategy are still some way off.</p>

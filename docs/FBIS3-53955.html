[Bayramov] Relations between Iran and Turkmenistan are  broadening day by day and this is a source of much pleasure to  us. As you are aware, last October the president of the Islamic  Republic of Iran, Hashemi-Rafsanjani, visited Turkmenistan and  the officials of the two countries discussed numerous issues.  The visit by President Niyazov is a follow-up to the agreements  reached during that visit and it is being viewed as extremely  important. President Niyazov is scheduled to visit Esfahan,  Shiraz, Kish, Gonbad-e Kavus in addition to Tehran.    We believe this will be an opportunity for the Turkmen  President to view the economic issues and capabilities of Iran  at close quarters and this would benefit both countries.    I have just taken over this assignment and now that I am in  close contact with Iran I feel that the understanding between  the officials of the two sides is much stronger. In my opinion,  both countries are keen on the progress of their respective  countries and nations. The former Soviet Union kept the Iranian  and Turkmen nations segregated for a long time but after  independence, the two countries have become closer to one  another and this is a source of much pride and joy to us. The  fact that the Iranian officials express their affection for us  and consider us a friendly fraternal country gives us immense  happiness.    [KEYHAN] What is the level of economic and commercial ties  between Iran and Turkmenistan?    [Bayramov] At present Iran has some centers for the sale of  its goods in Turkmenistan, which has been warmly welcomed by the  Turkmen people. These centers will be expanded in the future.  Of course, we are not going to content ourselves with trade  only. It has been decided that factories will be jointly set up  by the two countries in Turkmenistan with Iranian and Turkish  investment. Products from these factories will be for domestic  consumption as well as for export by Turkmenistan.    The relevant ministers regularly exchange visits and study  the conditions and feasibility of the projects. For example,  Turkmenistan has very rich mines that yield construction stones  and Iran is able to set up factories to polish these stones and  to prepare them for decorative use.    These stones can be used in Turkmenistan and can be valuable  exports as well. Numerous other factories will be set up in  Turkmenistan and Iran will provide the technology and machinery  for these factories.    At present the Tejen-Sarakhs railroad is under construction  and is a joint project. Agreements on other projects are  expected to be signed between the two sides during the course of  President Niyazov's visit. In our opinion the agreements of the  two countries that are on paper are not of consequence but it is  the follow-up and practical measures that will be implemented.    [KEYHAN] In view of the travels of citizens of the two  countries, what measures have been envisaged by the Turkmenistan  Government for providing facilities for Iranian passengers?    [Bayramov] We respect passengers who come to our country  with noble ideas and objectives and we believe in providing them  with all possible facilities. If their objectives can prove  effective and beneficial for the interests of the two countries,  such as setting up factories, or for trade and so on, we welcome  them especially. Our country is still young but wishes to have  relations with all countries. I stress that if one does not  interfere in our internal affairs, one is free to travel to our  country.    The majority of the Iranians travelling to Turkmenistan have  sincere and noble intentions and only come to get acquainted  with our country and to meet their relatives. Others come to  set up factories and for business purposes and we welcome them  wholeheartedly.    [KEYHAN] What steps have been taken to abolish visa  restrictions between the two countries?    [Bayramov] Talks are in progress on the subject and visa  requirements will be waived.    [KEYHAN] What is the nature of the relations between  Turkmenistan and the Western countries?    [Bayramov] As I said earlier, Turkmenistan's border is open  to every country. We will enter no political bloc. We want to  have reciprocal relations with every country, just as we have  with Iran. Numerous political and economic delegations regularly  visit Turkmenistan from France, Germany, Canada, the United  States, Italy, Argentina, and Japan. We are not a closed  country. Relations with these countries have led to some  valuable industrial and economic agreements. We grasp the hand  of every country that comes to us with noble and pure intentions.    [KEYHAN] Have your warm and close relations with Iran  affected your relations with other countries?    [Bayramov] No country has the right to interfere in this  issue. Similarly, no country can question why we have close  relations with, say, Iran. This has had no impact on our  relations with other countries.    [KEYHAN] Do you have relations with Saudi Arabia and Israel  as well?    [Bayramov] We have no embassy in Israel. As I stated  earlier, if a country comes with noble intentions and with plans  and projects to benefit both sides, we will study them on  condition that their intentions are sincere and positive. We  have relations with Saudi Arabia but we have no embassy there  yet.    [KEYHAN] What kind of economic and cultural relations do you  have with Turkey?    [Bayramov] As with Iran, we have cordial fraternal relations  with Turkey. We have set up factories with Turkey's  collaboration and we have bilateral commercial relations. Our  students study at cultural and university centers in Turkey.    [KEYHAN] Do you have any particular pattern in mind for the  political administration of your country?    [Bayramov] We copy no country's system. We are independent  and we have our own distinct national policy. We do not emulate  the model of any particular country. From every country with  which we have relations, we adapt things as we see fit to the  conditions in our country.    [KEYHAN] Since Turkmenistan joined organizations such as the  Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) and the Caspian Sea  Organization after becoming independent, how do you see the  future of such cooperation?    [Bayramov] We attach immense importance to regional  cooperation, especially economically. Such cooperation  certainly benefits all regional countries. If we can get gas to  transit through Iran and export it to the world, it will benefit  everyone, including Iran. If we expand the communication routes  among regional countries, it would certainly benefit them all.  If the Turkmen railroad is extended to join Iran's, we can link  ourselves with Pakistan, Turkey, and Afghanistan. We believe  that organizations for regional cooperation such as the ECO and  the Caspian Sea Organization will bring immense benefits to the  newly independent countries such as Turkmenistan, Tajikistan,  Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan.    [KEYHAN] How are your relations with Russia? To what extent  has economic and cultural dependence on Moscow been eliminated?    [Bayramov] We do not depend on Russia. We have not severed  our links with it; we have cordial economic and commercial  relations with all the newly independent countries of the former  Soviet Union. But we cannot tell Russia what to do and they  cannot tell us either. It makes no difference to us whether a  country is big or small. We may feel overwhelmed by larger  countries in the same way that we feel no sense that smaller  countries are great.    [KEYHAN] What is your opinion of the political adversity in  Tajikistan? Does it have any fallout effect on your country?    [Bayramov] In our opinion, events in Tajikistan are a purely  internal affair and no country has the right to interfere. We  believe the Tajiks should solve their problems themselves.</p>

			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / NHS trusts 'slow' in shifting to local pay NATIONAL HEALTH Service trusts are only slowly breaking away from nationally set pay and conditions for their staff, Industrial Relations Services, the independent employment research company, says today. Under NHS reforms trusts can employ new staff on locally set pay and conditions, rather than complying with national agreements. Staff who transferred to trusts are entitled to retain national terms. Although three quarters of the 33 trusts surveyed by IRS employ some staff on local pay and conditions, the proportion of staff in each trust on these terms is low. Most are senior managers or directors. Many trusts said a lack of management time and resources was a reason why moves to devolve setting pay to local managers have been limited. Others said the government's 1.5 per cent ceiling on public-sector pay had played its part. Any radical shake-up of pay by trusts was likely to cost far more than the 1.5 per cent available for this year. Other findings include: More trusts have cut staff than increased numbers since gaining self-governing status. Only two trusts claimed to have derecognised any unions since opting out. Performance-related pay was restricted to management in all but two of the trusts that had merit pay. New recognition agreements with trade unions have been reached by 60 per cent of trusts in the survey. IRS Employment Trends. IRS, 18-20 Highbury Place, London N5 1QP. By subscription.</p>

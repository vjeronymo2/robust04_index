			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains trimmed in slow trading IT WAS left to Glaxo and ICI, two of the more heavily weighted stocks in the London market, to keep the equity sector firm at the close of a lacklustre session yesterday. Expectations of another cut in domestic interest rates at Budget time also helped, and optimistic views on UK retail trading benefited from news of a stronger rise in December's consumer credit than expected. In early deals, the FT-SE 100 Index gained 18.2 points, largely in response to Wall Street's record close ahead of the weekend. Trading volume was disappointing in London, however, and it was a firm opening in stock index futures which provided the impetus for the equity market. Initial weakness in sterling failed to dent base rate hopes but encouraged demand for shares in Britain's export companies. There was little heart behind London's advance, and share prices came off the top when Wall Street made a sluggish start to the new session, shedding 5.41 Dow points in UK trading hours. By the close, the gain on the FT-SE 100 had been cut to 7.1 for a final reading on the day of 2,870. The peak of 2,900, traded briefly in the wake of last week's unexpected reduction in rates by the Bundesbank, appears a solid barrier, at least until interest rates fall again or there is more convincing evidence that the domestic economy has steadied. Yesterday brought news of further job cuts by National Westminster Bank and gloom deepened over prospects for the UK operations of Daf, the truck manufacturer struggling with financial collapse. US buying of pharmaceutical issues provided one of the firmer spots in the London market. The rise in Glaxo shares made up 3.5 points of the day's rise in the Footsie, with ICI's gain on currency factors providing a further 2 points. Investors continued to buy the construction stocks, which have been perceived as the backbone of the interest rate-sensitive sector. Properties, too, held on to their recent advance. There were further gains among the utility shares, where dividends are seen as attractive. Among the weaker features, food retailers continued to shy away from strengthening fears that the sector may be targeted for increased VAT in the Budget, due in March. Banks, now on the eve of their corporate reporting season, held steady, although the sector is prominent in the list of rights issue predictions. Trading volume proved disappointingly modest, with the US houses active at first but failing to follow through when Wall Street opened. The day's Seaq total of 545.8m shares compared with 694.6m on Friday, when retail business lived up to its recent buoyancy to record a value total of Pounds 1.47bn. Non-Footsie volume jumped sharply yesterday, comprising nearly 70 per cent of the day's business. In the early part of the session, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which tracks the impact of second line stocks, moved up smartly. But profit-taking in the smaller stocks increased significantly and by the close the Mid 250 Index was a mere 0.9 up on the day at 3,051.4. The FT-SE Mid 250 outperformed in January, rising by 3.2 per cent, compared with the fall of 1.4 per cent in the FT-SE 100 Index. According to the Stock Exchange, turnover in domestic equities increased by 9.8 per cent on the month and by 17.8 per cent on the year.</p>

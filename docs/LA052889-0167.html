			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALENDAR'S SUMMER SPLASH;  </P> <P> CRITIC'S CHOICES;  </P> <P> JAZZ  </P> <P> Eclecticism will be the keynote at the 11th annual Playboy Jazz Festival June  17-18 at the Hollywood Bowl. For jazz-fusion fans there will be the likes of  Stanley Clarke, George Duke and Spyro Gyra, but the cause of unhyphenated jazz  will be well served by the big bands of Terry Gibbs and Illinois Jacquet, the  combos of Art Blakey and Dave Brubeck, and a rare straight-ahead appearance by  George Benson with the McCoy Tyner Trio.  </P> <P> Among the five concerts scheduled for the "Jazz at the Bowl" summer series, the  most intriguing is set for Aug. 9, with three big bands: Frank Foster leading  the Basie ensemble, Mercer Ellington carrying on his father's legacy, and Louie  Bellson with his always exciting ensemble, plus Carmen McRae as guest soloist.  </P> <P> Not all this summer jazz is confined to the stage. Eagerly awaited is the  appearance June 23-24, at Catalina's in Hollywood, of an international 17-piece  orchestra led by George Gruntz, the Swiss born composer who for many years has  been musical director of the Berlin Jazz Festival. This will be the band's  first Southland gig.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDY OF L.A. RIVER FREEWAY PLAN AUTHORIZED BY COUNTY PANEL;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION: USE OF THE WATERWAY IS SEEN AS A WAY TO REDUCE CONGESTION AS  MUCH AS 20% ON TWO HEAVILY USED ROADWAYS, BUT ENVIRONMENTALISTS OBJECT.  </P> <P> Over the protests of environmentalists, the Los Angeles County Transportation  Commission on Wednesday authorized a $100,000 study to determine the  feasibility of turning 30 or 40 miles of the Los Angeles River into a part-time  freeway.  </P> <P> The controversial proposal by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) would create  exclusive express lanes for buses, car pools and trucks along the winding  floodway that extends from the San Fernando Valley through downtown Los Angeles  to Long Beach. Most of the waterway was paved half a century ago to control  flash flooding and carry waste water.  </P> <P> No one is certain if such a project would work or how much it would cost. But  according to Katz, chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee, the river  traffic lanes would relieve as much as 20% of the congestion on the Ventura and  Long Beach freeways. Critics say the scheme is not practical, would harm the  environment and would be dangerous when storms send floodwaters raging down the  concrete channels.  </P> <P> However, the commission's preliminary study found "no fatal flaws" in the idea.  </P> <P> Consultants, after an initial look at the proposal, reported, "With modest  improvements . . . the Los Angeles River and Tujunga Wash flood control  channels could be used for transportation purposes between 220 and 300 days a  year."  </P> <P> As Katz envisions the route, the northern sections from the Valley south to  Glendale and into downtown would be used by car pools, van pools and buses,  weather permitting. The southern segments of the river expressway would be  reserved for trucks running between the harbor and downtown. Trucks now  primarily use the Long Beach Freeway.  </P> <P> Opponents, led by the environmental group Friends of the River, contend that  such construction would destroy the fragile ecosystems that support green  vegetation and wildlife along some segments of the river channel that are not  paved. Hiking and equestrian trails near Griffith Park would be adversely  effected, they contend.  </P> <P> Instead of diverting traffic into the river bottom and adding to urban  congestion and air pollution, Lewis MacAdams, spokesman for the environmental  group, called for a green belt, parks and more trails along the river,  returning it to a more natural state.  </P> <P> The issues of safety and liability in the event of flash flooding were raised  by Commissioner Ray Grabinski, a Long Beach city councilman who is concerned  that motorists might get trapped in a flood.  </P> <P> "Who is responsible?" he asked Katz, who had spelled out the proposal for the  commission a few minutes earlier.  </P> <P> Katz said the $100,000 study was needed to answer such questions, adding, "This  may not be the answer to the transportation crisis in Los Angeles . . . but we  have to look at what resources we have, see how we can get ourselves out of  trouble."  </P> <P> The commission authorized the study on a voice vote and directed that the  questions of safety and liability be answered. The study will also determine  how to handle the treated sewage that now flows down the river, an issue raised  by opponents.  </P> <P> Consultants doing the study will also have to determine if the freeway lanes  could be built without interfering with the flood control functions of the  waterway. The freeway work would have to be coordinated with the Army Corps of  Engineers, which has overall responsibility for the floodway.  </P> <P> A financial plan would also be developed during the study, spelling out how  much the project would cost and how it would be financed.  </P></p>

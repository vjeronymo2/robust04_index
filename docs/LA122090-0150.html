			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: WHITTIER;  </P> <P> RIO HONDO PRESIDENT GETS 2-YEAR CONTRACT EXTENSION  </P> <P> Rio Hondo Community College President Alex Sanchez has received a vote of  confidence from the board of trustees who unanimously agreed to give him a  two-year extension on his three-year contract.  </P> <P> In July, 1989, trustees voted 3 to 2 to hire Sanchez.  </P> <P> Board members Bill Hernandez and Ralph Pacheco voted for another candidate.  </P> <P> However, Hernandez and Pacheco said Sanchez has done a good job since replacing  Herbert M. Sussman, who had been president since 1982.  </P> <P> "This represents a vote of confidence. This gives him an opportunity to  implement his goals," Pacheco said.  </P> <P> Hernandez said also that Sanchez had done a good job in helping bring harmony  to the board whose members who had often been at political odds with one  another.  </P> <P> The new contract does not call for any increase in pay for Sanchez, who was  hired at $91,875 a year. However, he has received two cost-of-living increases,  a 3.3% and a 5% hike.  </P> <P> Sanchez is the college's first Latino top administrator. More than half of the  school's 12,600 students are Latino.  </P> <P> Sanchez was a vice president of the University of New Mexico before taking the  Rio Hondo job.  </P></p>

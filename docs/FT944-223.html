			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Bass chief's pay increases 17% Mr Ian Prosser, chairman and chief executive of Bass, the brewing group, enjoyed a 17 per cent rise in total pay last year from Pounds 505,000 to Pounds 593,000 - twice the rate of increase in group pre-tax profits. The annual report shows that Mr Prosser's basic salary rose from Pounds 440,000 to Pounds 449,000, while his bonus jumped from Pounds 65,000 to Pounds 144,000. Bass said this reflected stronger increases than in the previous year in both pre-tax profits (8.7 per cent) and earnings per share (10.5 per cent), compared with targets set by the remuneration committee. Mr Prosser's pension contributions increased from Pounds 110,000 to Pounds 114,000. The salary increase made Mr Prosser Bass's highest-paid director. The man who beat him last year was believed to be Mr Bryan Langton, chairman of the Holiday Inn subsidiary, who earned Pounds 531,000. Bass has set out performance conditions for a new executive share option scheme, which will be voted on by shareholders at the annual meeting on February 9. The first options will not be exercisable unless group earnings per share over three years increase by at least 3.03 percentage points above retail price inflation. This is Bass's second reform in corporate governance this year, after moving its directors from three to two-year rolling contracts in October.</p>

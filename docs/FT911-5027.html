			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: Reynolds Metals dips sharply REYNOLDS METALS, second-largest US aluminium group, suffered a 64 per cent fall in first-quarter net earnings, from Dollars 77.7m or Dollars 1.31 a share to Dollars 27.5m or 46 cents. But results should improve 'significantly' during the rest of the year, said Mr Bill Bourke, chairman, 'especially with the economic recovery anticipated in the second half.' He said the impact of the recession, which began in the second half of 1990, worsened in the latest quarter. 'While the price of primary aluminium ingot was down only slightly from the levels of a year ago, lower prices and volume for a number of fabricated products further eroded margins,' he added. Reynolds' revenues in the quarter slipped from Dollars 1.39bn to Dollars 1.38bn, but its aluminium shipments increased from 319,700 tonnes to 322,100 tonnes.</p>

			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> COMMUNISTS OPPOSE CHANGES  </P> <P> Defiant Communist officials said today they oppose widespread private property  and indicated the party will resist calls to give up its own vast holdings and  share power in a coalition government.  </P> <P> The officials, briefing reporters on a two-day Central Committee plenum that  ended Tuesday, also rejected the elimination of party cells in the work place  and said the Soviet Union will continue to celebrate Revolution Day as a  national holiday.  </P> <P> Vladimir A. Ivashko, the party's No. 2 leader after Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said  private property "will have to be restricted for quite a while" and "it is a  process of privatization, not a one-time act or decree." And Politburo member  Alexander Dzasokhov quoted party economists as saying just 7% of all property  should be transferred to private ownership in the next 10 to 12 years.  </P></p>

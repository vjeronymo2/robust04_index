			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> 23,000 AMERICANS CALL SCANDINAVIA HOME;  </P> <P> EMIGRATION: FOR THE MOST PART, IT'S FAMILY HISTORY THAT PULLS THEM BACK TO  SWEDEN AND NORWAY. BUT THERE ARE MANY REASONS THEY STAY.  </P> <P> Erik Means may sit on the edge of a majestic fiord someday and regale his  grandchildren with tales of the old country -- the United States.  </P> <P> Viking blood stirs in a few people every year, calling them to their ancestral  homeland. A New Yorker settles on a remote Norwegian farm, a Coloradan in an  arctic village, a native of sunny California in chilly Stockholm.  </P> <P> They are descendants of the 2 million Scandinavians who went to the United  States in an exodus that peaked around 1900. Like Means, 27, they may have  grown up hearing from their parents that Scandinavia was really home.  </P> <P> Some seek roots, others economic opportunity, as their forebears did in  leaving. Some married Scandinavians.  </P> <P> "I finished college in Canada and didn't have any experience," said Means, a  dual U.S.-Norwegian citizen reared in Hamilton, Canada. "My only real edge was  that I was fluent in both Norwegian and English. The only place that was any  good was Norway."  </P> <P> About 12,000 U.S. citizens live in Norway and 11,000 in Sweden, but no record  is kept of how many of those have roots in this region.  </P> <P> On the other side of the ocean, Americans of Norwegian descent outnumber  Norway's 4.2 million people. There are 4.3 million Americans of Swedish  ancestry, roughly half Sweden's population of 8.5 million.  </P> <P> "A lot more would come, at least for a while, if the opportunity presented  itself," said Hans Eiyvind Naess, who directs a genealogical center in  Stavanger, Norway. There are strict limits on immigration.  </P> <P> In the poor years of the late 19th Century, about one person in four left  Sweden and Norway for North America. Now, powerful industries and North Sea oil  give Scandinavia one of the world's highest living standards.  </P> <P> Romanticized tales of Scandinavia or hand-me-downs from homesick ancestors  don't prepare the immigrants.  </P> <P> "They seem to expect people to ride around in horse-drawn buggies, wearing  traditional costumes," said Arthur Svennevik, a New Yorker now living on his  ancestral farm in south Norway.  </P> <P> "They expect things to be the way they were in the States 50 years ago and  arrive to find that it is probably a more modern country than the United  States," said Svennevik, who often spent summers in Norway as a child.  </P> <P> Nor are regular visits much help, said Knut Dybdal, a folklore researcher born  in Norway and reared in Compton, Ohio.  </P> <P> "It's one thing to be a guest," he said. "It's another to settle. You can play  by U.S. rules as a visitor. When you settle, you are expected to learn and play  by Norwegian rules."  </P> <P> One American called Scandinavia "deceptively familiar," seeming similar to the  United States but fundamentally different.  </P> <P> Steve Strid, a Swedish-American living in Stockholm, said the adjustment passes  through phases.  </P> <P> "At first, it was like being in a giant amusement park; everything was fun  because it was new," said Strid, 31, of Sacramento. After a couple years,  everything seems wrong and annoying, then acceptance comes, he said.  </P> <P> Strid and others tried at first to assimilate, speaking only Nordic languages  and associating with Scandinavian friends.  </P> <P> Eventually, like their fathers who sought fellowship among people from their  own countries, many hunger for the company of other Americans and seek each  other out.  </P> <P> Apathy about baseball can become a passion for it. Lukewarm patriots may become  fierce defenders of their homeland.  </P> <P> Few are ready to return to the United States, but just as few say they have  settled in Scandinavia for good, although the years pile up quickly.  </P> <P> "I came here for a year or two, 13 years ago," said Svennevik, whose parents  were Norwegian.  </P> <P> "I don't know if I'll stay forever; forever is a long time," said Means, father  of a Norwegian-Danish-American infant son.  </P> <P> Despite high taxes, an unfamiliar and sometimes meddlesome welfare state and a  daunting cost of living, most people interviewed said they are better off in  Scandinavia than they had been in the United States.  </P> <P> "My friends think it's propaganda when I tell them about my lifestyle here,"  said Strid, a free-lance writer. "Most Americans seem to have a short circuit  when I tell them I live in Stockholm. They just don't understand it."  </P> <P> Dybdal, whose home overlooks a magnificent fiord, said, "If I could have the  house and the kind of lifestyle I have here, I'd probably move back to Oregon."  </P> <P> The concept of home changes.  </P> <P> "Once you move across the Atlantic, you never really have a home again," Dybdal  said.  </P> <P> "I don't know where home is," said Victoria Hybert, a native of Denver who  moved to arctic Norway with her Norwegian husband in 1969.  </P> <P> Hybert had one Norwegian grandparent and was only vaguely aware of Norway, but  "now I can't imagine moving back to the States."  </P> <P> "Here it's safe, and people still do things like go for walks in the park on  Sunday afternoons," she said.  </P> <P> The immigrants don't forget being Americans, but some watch their children  become Scandinavians.  </P> <P> "My three boys are more Norwegian than American," Hybert said. "But I'm always  telling them stories about the States."  </P></p>

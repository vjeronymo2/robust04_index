			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department encourages the use of statistical models since they are more efficient and precise in identifying claimants as well as easier to manage and adapt. However, States may use characteristic screening. Whichever system is used, each State must assure that the system implemented in fact identifies claimants who are permanently laid off and unlikely to return to work in either their previous industry or occupation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Selection Pool.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the profiling system anticipated by the Department (see item 4), all claimants identified in accordance with the requirements of Section 303(j)(1), SSA, will be either immediately referred to reemployment services or, if services are not available, placed in a selection pool. Claimants in the selection pool may be referred to services at a latter date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted in the background section, early intervention is one of the principal aims of the worker profiling and reemployment services initiative. Holding claimants in the pool for more than a minimum period of time will not achieve this early intervention. Therefore, the Department recommends that claimants be removed from the selection pool after 4 weeks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Department recognizes that large-scale permanent layoffs and plant closings do not occur at regular intervals. Therefore, there may be times when a State elects to retain claimants in the pool for longer periods. States may also elect to vary the length of time individuals are held in the pool by locality within the State. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notifications of Referrals to Reemployment Services.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Notification to claimants of referrals to reemployment services should occur  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> only  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> if a referral is actually made. (It is not necessary to notify claimants that they have been placed in the selection pool since they are not required to take any action until a referral is made.) These notification and referral notices must be in writing and must advise claimants: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;That they have been identified as likely to need reemployment services in order to make a successful transition to new employment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;When and where to report for the services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;To bring all relevant information concerning ongoing or recently completed reemployment services or current training in which they have participated and believe would help them return to work. Alternatively, States may choose to have certain claimants, such as those already in training, contact the UI agency first. Either way, the notice must clearly explain what information the claimant is expected to provide and to whom. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;That failure to participate in reemployment services may result in denial of UI. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each State must maintain a record of each claimant referral notification in the same manner that it would any other formal correspondence that is pertinent to the adjudication of UI eligibility issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

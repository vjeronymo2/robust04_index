			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ALOMARS AN ALL-STAR FAMILY;  </P> <P> PADRES: ROBERTO ALOMAR, ALONG WITH TEAMMATE TONY GWYNN, IS NAMED AN NL RESERVE.  BROTHER SANDY JR. HAD ALREADY BEEN SELECTED AS THE STARTING AL CATCHER FOR  TUESDAY'S GAME.  </P> <P> The All-Star game is all about fantasies, dreams and memories, and as far as  that goes, not many people are having it any better these days than the Alomar  family.  </P> <P> The Padres got word Thursday, just before their 4-1 loss to St. Louis, that  second baseman Roberto Alomar and outfielder Tony Gwynn had been selected by  Manager Roger Craig to the National League team for Tuesday's game at Chicago's  Wrigley Field. Benito Santiago was voted as the NL's starting catcher by the  fans, but a broken left arm will prevent him from playing.  </P> <P> And that's too bad. Remember all of that talk during the past couple of years  about Santiago and Sandy Alomar Jr.? The trade rumors, the who-should-stay and  who-should-go talk and the rest. Well, Alomar Jr., now a rookie for the  Cleveland Indians, will start behind the plate for the American League and join  brother Roberto for an All-Star debut.  </P> <P> So you can see, then, why Sandy Alomar Sr., Padre third base coach and one  proud padre, is going through one of those once-in-a-lifetime stretches these  days:  </P> <P> Wednesday, July 4: Daughter Sandia is in the middle of celebrating her 25th  birthday at home in Puerto Rico when the results of fan voting are announced.  Sandy Alomar Jr. is named as the AL's starting catcher.  </P> <P> Thursday, July 5: Roberto Alomar is picked as an NL reserve after finishing  second in the fan balloting, to Chicago's Ryne Sandberg, with 529,390 votes.  </P> <P> Tuesday, July 10: The Alomars will gather at Wrigley Field. Oh, and Maria  Alomar -- Sandy Sr.'s wife and mother to Sandy Jr. and Roberto -- will  celebrate her birthday. Sandy Sr. and Maria will be in the Wrigley Field  stands; Roberto and Sandy Jr. will be in the dugouts. They are unsure if Sandia  will be able to make the trip.  </P> <P> What a week.  </P> <P> "How can you put it?" Sandy Alomar Sr. said. "I can't put it any better than  that."  </P> <P> He was an All-Star, too, for the Angels in 1970. But Thursday, he was talking  more about his sons.  </P> <P> "I've always been a very proud father," he said. "People have to realize I'm  very proud of my kids for the way they act as persons. And they have talent and  know how to display that talent."  </P> <P> The Alomar brothers are the first All-Star brother combination since Jim and  Gaylord Perry in 1970. So you can see why CBS, the network that will broadcast  the game, has been rummaging around looking for profile material. On Monday,  the network sent people to interview Roberto at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium  and Sandy Sr. and Maria at their San Diego home. Roberto said people were even  sent to Puerto Rico, where the Alomars grew up.  </P> <P> Roberto was in the Padre video room when he got word of his All-Star selection.  His father and Gwynn approached him at around noon Thursday.  </P> <P> "I wasn't surprised," Roberto said. "But I wasn't sure I was going to make it.  I'll be playing with the best players in both leagues, and that's something I'm  never going to forget.  </P> <P> "It came real soon in my career. I never thought I'd make it that quick."  </P> <P> Roberto is 22, Sandy Jr. 24.  </P> <P> "For Sandy, I'm especially proud," Sandy Sr. said. "He had a tough time coming  into the big leagues. Last year, all he went through . . . the trade rumors,  getting sent back to the minors after having had a good year. But it made him a  better ballplayer."  </P> <P> As for Gwynn, he will be making his sixth appearance in the game but will not  start for just the second time after finishing fourth in the fan balloting with  1,143,282 votes. The top three were Andre Dawson, Lenny Dykstra and Kevin  Mitchell. Thursday, Gwynn was more worried about the current state of the  Padres.  </P> <P> "Oh yeah, it's an honor," he said. "It's always an honor. You don't feel real  good about going, though, with the way we've played during the last couple of  weeks."  </P> <P> As for not starting, Gwynn said that suits him just fine.  </P> <P> "To tell you the truth, it's more fun coming in off the bench," Gwynn said.  "You can joke around and pick stuff up.  </P> <P> "It's kind of nice to bounce ideas off of other players. See what they think.  Last year, I picked up a couple of tips."  </P> <P> Gwynn will also pick up an extra $25,000 because of the All-Star incentive  clause in his contract. Roberto Alomar will receive an extra $10,000.  </P> <P> He will also have a message for his brother, if the situation is right. If  Sandy Jr. is catching when Roberto steps up to the plate:  </P> <P> "I'll tell him, 'Don't be afraid to tell the pitcher to throw a fastball.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> ALL-STAR BROTHER COMBINATIONS Alomar -- Roberto (Padres, NL) and Sandy  (Cleveland, AL), 1990.  </P> <P> Alou -- Felipe (Atlanta, NL) and Matty (Pittsburgh, NL), 1968.  </P> <P> Cooper -- Mort (St. Louis, NL (2); Boston, NL) and Walker (St. Louis, NL (2);  New York NL), 1942, 1943, 1946.  </P> <P> DiMaggio -- Joe (New York, AL) and Dom (Boston, AL), 1941, 1942, 1946, 1949,  1950, 1951.  </P> <P> May -- Carlos (Chicago, AL) and Lee (Cincinnati, NL), 1969.  </P> <P> Perry -- Jim (Minnesota, AL) and Gaylord (San Francisco, NL), 1970.  </P> <P> Walker -- Dixie (Brooklyn, NL) and Harry (St. Louis, NL), 1943.  </P></p>

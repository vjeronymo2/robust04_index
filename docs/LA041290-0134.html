			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TROUBLED THRIFTS STILL PAY TOP SAVINGS DEPOSIT RATES  </P> <P> Some of the nation's most troubled thrifts -- including some already under  regulatory control -- continue to pay among the highest rates for savings  deposits, despite government efforts to curb the practice.  </P> <P> Industry experts contend that the higher rates often translate into higher  costs for troubled thrifts, which could increase the tab for the  taxpayer-financed federal bailout of the industry. In effect, taxpayers are  subsidizing high rates to depositors at these ailing thrifts, experts say.  </P> <P> But regulators say there is little else that sick thrifts can do.  </P> <P> "The institutions need to maintain a certain amount of liquidity and the  negative publicity that surrounds a takeover requires (that) they pay a little  higher premium for deposits than their competitors," said Dan Page, a spokesman  for the Office of Thrift Supervision in San Francisco. "It is not the most  desirable thing, but it is necessary under the circumstances."  </P> <P> Still, the differences are sometimes staggering. An informal survey of 10  California thrifts -- including five that meet capital requirements versus five  that don't -- revealed that sick thrifts paid between 0.10 and 1 percentage  point more than healthy institutions.  </P> <P> The highest rate payer locally is Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan, which is  under tight operating restrictions because of its deteriorating financial  health. It pays an annualized rate of 8.6% on both six-month and one-year jumbo  certificates of deposit (those generally with balances of $100,000 or more),  and will pay up to 8.71% if the depositor is over the age of 55.  </P> <P> By comparison, Great Western Bank, a Beverly Hills-based thrift that currently  meets all regulatory requirements, pays only 7.72% for a six-month jumbo CD and  only 7.95% for a one-year jumbo CD.  </P> <P> In other words, a saver with a $100,000 deposit would earn roughly $650 more  each year by depositing the money in Valley Federal versus Great Western.  </P> <P> Gibraltar Savings, which is insolvent and currently under regulatory control,  pays 8.59% for six-month jumbo CDs, while the other three troubled institutions  surveyed -- Columbia Savings, Mercury Savings and Imperial Savings -- paid  between 8.35% and 8.4%.  </P> <P> The healthy institutions surveyed -- California Federal, Glendale Federal, Home  Savings and World Savings -- paid a maximum of 8.22% for six-month jumbo CDs.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, federal regulators maintain they have made progress in reducing  the premiums sick thrifts pay for deposits. Two years ago, sick thrifts were  paying between 0.25 and 0.35 percentage points more for deposits than average  rates nationwide, said Eric Hirschhorn, director of industry analysis at the  Office of Thrift Supervision in Washington. However, by the end of last year,  that premium dropped to under 0.1 percentage point.  </P> <P> During the same period of time, the government has closed, sold or placed  hundreds of sick thrifts under regulatory control. That cut the percentage of  sick thrifts operating independently from 20% of the industry to less than 9%.  </P> <P> Although many insolvent thrifts under government control still pay higher  rates, Hirschhorn notes that the government can ensure that those rates are not  totally out of line. For example, the government can provide money to a  troubled thrift, thereby reducing the institution's need to pay high rates to  attract deposits.  </P> <P> That's helped both solvent and insolvent thrifts, he said. The interest that  savings institutions pay on deposits is generally one of their biggest  operating expenses, so any reduction in these rates often filters down to  higher bottom-line profits. And because savings deposits of $100,000 and less  are federally insured, competition forces healthy thrifts to keep their rates  competitive with their weaker brethren.  </P> <P> Still, many healthy thrifts are dissatisfied with the fact that sick  institutions are still allowed to pay these high rates.  </P> <P> * LURING DEPOSITORS  </P> <P> Columbia S&amp;L will refund early-withdrawal fines.

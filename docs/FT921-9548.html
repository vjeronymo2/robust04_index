			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Boardroom shake-up at Brown &amp; Jackson MR IAN Gray, a former director of Thorn EMI, has been appointed chief executive at Brown &amp; Jackson, the discount retail chain. Mr Gray, who had run Thorn's HMV and Rumbelows chains as well as its UK rental division, replaces Mr Andrew Reid. Mr Reid's resignation had been sought by a group of institutional shareholders who had been concerned over his role in the acquisition of the former ATI subsidiary. ATI was purchased in 1988 from a group which included Mr Brian Duffy, then Brown &amp; Jackson chairman, in a transaction ultimately valued at Pounds 18m. Over the 1991 year, ATI incurred an estimated net loss of Pounds 2.3m and a recently completed review by Brown &amp; Jackson's financial advisers found that some of its earlier profits may have been questionable. Mr Gray said that he would seek a refinancing of the company, probably through a rights issue. He dismissed speculation that the company would sell its Poundstretcher discount retail chain, saying he would take over direct management of its operations. 'The future of the company will be built around Poundstretcher,' he said. Mr Christopher Roshier and Mr Gerald McLeod have joined Brown &amp; Jackson's board as non-executive directors, while two former directors, Mr Robert Dowds and Mr Charles King, have resigned. Mr Michael Kerrison, finance director and Mr Henry Bliss, corporate development director, remain on the board. Institutional shareholders had said they would not agree to a rights issue unless the company disposed of the ATI subsidiary and brought in a new management team.</p>

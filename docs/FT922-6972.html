			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Barclays pulls out of US retail banking BARCLAYS BANK yesterday unveiled plans to sell off its 65-branch New York retail banking operations in a move that will mark the UK bank's withdrawal from the US retail banking business. The buyer of the Barclays operations is the Bank of New York, the 17th largest US bank with 223 retail branches in the New York area. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the New York bank is believed to be paying between Dollars 25m (Pounds 14.10m) and Dollars 50m for the Barclays branch network, which comes with Dollars 3.2bn of assets. The UK bank's total North American assets are Dollars 22bn. The 65 branches being acquired come with Dollars 2.9bn of deposits and Dollars 2.1bn of loans. Barclays declined to say what portion of these loans were classified as non-performing. The deal is expected to close by October. The Barclays move comes 21 years after the British clearer first began building up its US retail banking operations. It has been selling off a series of US consumer finance businesses and retail branches since the 1989 sale to Wells Fargo of its 50-branch California operations. Heavy bad debt provisions - stemming largely from problem property loans - caused Barclays' US holdings to suffer a total loss of Pounds 217m in 1991, compared with a Pounds 20m profit in 1990. Barclays' bad debt provisions in the US last year more than doubled at Pounds 339m. Mr John Kerslake, Barclays chief executive in the US, yesterday explained that, in terms of the bank's strategy 'to concentrate on serving the corporate and institutional markets', the New York retail branch banking network 'does not fit into that strategy'. Banking analysts stressed that Barclays, in common with other non-US banks such as National Westminster Bank, had found it increasingly difficult to manage a profitable branch business in the US. Barclays has been directing its strategy away from retail and middle market clients. For the Bank of New York, which has Dollars 40bn of assets and total deposits of Dollars 29.2bn, the acquisition of the Barclays network is considered a good fit. Both the Barclays and Bank of New York branches are concentrated in suburban New York areas such as Westchester and Long Island.</p>

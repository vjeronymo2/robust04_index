			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Buy-out fund launched for public sector THREE venture-capital groups are joining forces to provide Pounds 100m of investment for management buy-outs by government agencies and other public-service organisations. Electra Kingsway, Schroder Venture Advisers and ECI Ventures have launched the initiative with Capita Corporate Finance, a subsidiary of the fast-growing Capita Group. Capita - which started as a buy-out from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy - will assist managers preparing their businesses for privatisation, providing commercial advice and developing corporate plans and financial packages. The consortium expects an increasing number of buy-outs to follow last November's Citizen's Charter report which promised further privatisation. It is already retained in three current buy-out proposals. Among likely candidates for buy-outs are undertakings such as municipal bus companies, ports, airports and parts of British Rail once privatisation begins. Several of the 80 government agencies are also to be put up for sale as part of the market-testing policy, including DVOIT, the information technology wing of the Department of Transport, and Companies House. Other agencies will also be considered for privatisation every three years as their framework documents come up for renewal. The joint venture will back bids for such businesses by the management team, drawing on Capita's experience in public-sector buy-outs in local government and public utilities. Mr Clive Ward, managing director of Capita Corporate Finance, said: 'The major ingredients for successful management buy-outs already exist in many public-sector activities - strong management teams and secure, thriving businesses with good opportunities for growth outside the public sector.' Capita has advised in more than half the buy-outs in local government, including MRS Environmental Services, the management and employee buy-out of Westminster City Council's street cleaning and refuse collection operation. Capita also advised in the buy-out of London Coaches, the sightseeing division of London Buses and its first subsidiary to be privatised, as well as the Pounds 71m management and employee buy-out of West Midlands Travel. The three venture-capital groups together manage or advise funds of more than Pounds 1bn in the UK.</p>

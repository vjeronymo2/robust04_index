			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Observer: Safe haven The American University of Beirut, a favourite target for kidnappers, is topping up its staff again. The university, from where US hostages Joseph Cicippio and Tom Sutherland were snatched and where Brian Keenan once worked, is looking for a director of internal audit and deputy comptroller to shore up its depleted administration. However, in a bid to reduce staff turnover the advert stipulates that only non-US passport holders will be considered. Meanwhile, the university's director of personnel, who knows a thing or two about the dangers of living in the Middle East, will vet applications from the safety of an office on New York's Third Avenue.</p>

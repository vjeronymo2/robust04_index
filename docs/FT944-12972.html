			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / The Markets: You'll pay - even if you weren't conned - Serious Money An unsung victim of the latest great pensions scandal could be . . . you. Of course, the worst hit are the hundreds and thousands of people who were advised wrongly to buy personal pensions. But the bill for compensation - estimated at up to Pounds 2bn - will be footed partly by other life insurance and pension policyholders. Here is how the chain works. Liability for recompense falls either on the independent financial adviser or on the life insurance company if the sale was made by a life company salesman or appointed rep. But where does the life insurance company go for money? For mutual companies, the only source is the life insurance fund, which is wholly owned by holders of its life insurance and pension policies. Companies with shareholders can go both to policyholders and to shareholders. If they fund the compensation payments from the life fund, roughly 90 per cent will normally come from policyholders and the other 10 per cent from shareholders - and they could also go direct to shareholders. All the figures involved are so notional at the moment that there is no point in trying to work out the impact of the compensation payments on individual companies. There are around Pounds 300bn of life funds. So, even if the whole of the compensation were the responsibility of the life companies (very unrealistic), the compensation still would be less than 1 per cent of assets. Some companies may take a bigger hit. What is more, the fresh cash drain comes at a time when life insurance payouts on with-profit policies are falling and are likely to drop further. Many industry experts reckon that far too many life insurance companies are still paying out much more than can be justified by their investment returns  -and running down their safety margins fast. So, policyholders will, yet again, pay for the mistakes of insurance management - as they have already over the disastrous forays into estate agency by some life companies. The innocent winner in the personal pension scandal is British industry. Company pension schemes have benefited from the improved solvency produced by the opt-outs - people who were persuaded to leave a company scheme even though they still worked at the company, or advised to buy a personal pension rather than join the company scheme. Meanwhile, the employers themselves have benefited both from this and from the drop in the number of employees for whom they need to make contributions. A large number of companies have enjoyed several years of pension 'holidays' during which they have not needed to pay in to the pension fund. Opt-outs are not the main reason for the pension surpluses which allowed companies to take these holidays, but they will have helped in some cases. A less innocent winner is the government - which enjoys the same benefits as any other employer. It is arguable that it is no more responsible for ill-advised opt-outs than any other employer. But the next pension scandal to break will be over the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps), where the government actually bribed people to trade in part of their state pension for a personal plan. Now for a couple of books for the very serious stock market investor. Both are potentially useful but both are hard work. The first is for people who want to understand not just what company accounts are trying to tell shareholders - but what they are trying to conceal. Interpreting Company Reports and Accounts*, by Holmes and Sugden, is in its fifth edition and remains the best way to learn about  - if not to love - the subject. The authors use real company examples, first to set out how all the items in accounts work and then to explain how investment analysts use them. The section on accounting loopholes is getting smaller, though. This is sad for the reader, since it was the most fun, but the shrinkage reflects good news for shareholders at large: the scope for financial sophistry is getting smaller. The other 'book' serves the investor who has a working knowledge of accounts but prefers to let other people crunch most of his numbers, while he concentrates on looking for that handful of shares worth buying. Publisher Hemmington Scott has used its extensive data base to produce a company handbook tailored to the requirements of former financier Jim Slater. Company Refs** is a touch gimmicky but provides a diversity of investment yardsticks for all the companies in the FT-SE-A All-Share index. The main book is divided by company. The second slices companies by stock market sector, investment classification, attributes such as yield, and even the likelihood of companies being promoted to one of the main indexes such as the FT-SE 100. The third explains how to use the system Would anyone actually invest just on the basis of comparative analysis done with the help of Company Refs? Probably not. An intelligent investor would use it to get or confirm ideas - then send off for a set of company accounts and sweat through the numbers himself with Holmes and Sugden. Not for the faint-hearted. * Woodhead-Faulkner: Pounds 34.95. ** Subscription costs Pounds 475 a year for monthly updates; Pounds 175 for a quarterly service. Hemmington Scott - 0171-278-7769.</p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS CRY FOUL AFTER ORIOLES WIN, 11-9;  </P> <P> BULLPEN LETS ONE GET AWAY ON DEVEREAUX'S DISPUTED HOME RUN IN NINTH  </P> <P> Doug Rader's postgame address unfolded about the same way as the game he had  just witnessed -- starting slowly, gradually gaining steam and then, finally,  exploding.  </P> <P> "Any loss is tough, but it's especially tough to lose them that way," Rader  began, moments after his Angels were defeated in the bottom of the ninth  inning, 11-9, by the Baltimore Orioles Saturday night on a controversial home  run by Mike Devereaux.  </P> <P> "We lost a ballgame because we couldn't throw the ball over the plate and  because a foul ball was called fair. I'm not saying that from a biased  standpoint. Facts are facts. The ball was foul. We lose."  </P> <P> Rader stared at the ground, mentally replaying Devereaux's drive down the  left-field line and third-base umpire Jim Joyce's home-run signal. Rader's eyes  narrowed into slits of red as he tried to fight back the words.  </P> <P> He failed.  </P> <P> "I'm trying to weigh my words very, very carefully," Rader said, "because the  tempting thing would be to say that all you have to do is pop off in the press  regarding the ineptitude or inadequacy of an umpiring crew and it seems to get  results.  </P> <P> "But being the diplomatic kind of person I am, I refuse to do that. But it sure  seems to make some difference for some people . . . and I think that stinks."  </P> <P> Rader's reference was as obvious as three of the names on Saturday's roster of  umpires -- Jim McKean, Ken Kaiser and Larry Young. Those names comprise  three-fourths of the crew that last week riled Baltimore Manager Frank Robinson  to the point of threatening to retire.  </P> <P> That threat ultimately went unheeded, but only after American League President  Bobby Brown held an air-clearing meeting with Robinson.  </P> <P> This series at Memorial Stadium reunited Robinson with McKean, Kaiser and  Young, plus Joyce, who was filling in for regular member John Shulock, who is  on vacation.  </P> <P> And by Rader's implication, that reunion involved a gun-shy umpiring crew.  </P> <P> "The reason this game took so long was because the strike zone was the size of  this," Rader said, tossing a matchbook on his desk. "And all of a sudden, the  foul pole is extended 10 feet south.  </P> <P> "To lose a game like that is a shame."  </P> <P> The Angels lost this one after rolling up a season-high 19 hits -- including  four by utility outfielder Max Venable -- and taking a 9-7 lead into the bottom  of the ninth inning with bullpen closer Bryan Harvey on the mound.  </P> <P> As has been the norm with Harvey in recent weeks, he was wild. With one out in  the ninth, he walked Mickey Tettleton and Randy Milligan, threw two wild  pitches and surrendered a two-run single to pinch-hitter Larry Sheets.  </P> <P> Tie game, 9-9.  </P> <P> Out went Harvey and in came Bob McClure, Rader's third relief pitch of the  night. Up stepped Devereaux, the former Dodger outfielder who began this series  mired in a 1-for-23 slump.  </P> <P> McClure worked the count to 1 and 1, then made a third offering that Devereaux  drove down the left-field line. The ball hooked toward the foul pole and landed  in the seats.  </P> <P> Joyce called the ball fair, waving Devereaux around the bases on a game-winning  home-run trot that ended in a joyous Oriole celebration at the plate.  </P> <P> Ninety feet up the third-base line, however, livid Angels were converging on  Joyce. Third baseman Jack Howell and Rader began the protest, which was  heatedly picked up along the first-base line by Marcel Lachemann, the normally  mild-mannered pitching coach who, in this instance, had to be restrained from  Joyce.  </P> <P> "That was the best barometer of all," Rader said. "Marcel Lachemann is the  consummate gentleman. To see him in that condition should indicate clearly how  inadequate some people are."  </P> <P> Television replays appeared to support the Angels' contention, showing  Devereaux's ball slicing right to left in front of the foul pole.  </P> <P> Crew chief McKean, speaking on behalf of Joyce, said: "I saw two replays of it  and they were inconclusive. I couldn't tell from where I was. It was that  close. But Jim Joyce called it a home run."  </P> <P> And about Rader's remarks regarding the fallout from last week's dispute  between Robinson and McKean's crew?  </P> <P> "I have no comment to that," McKean said.  </P> <P> A plate umpire has the authority to override a questionable home-run call, but  Rader said that, given Saturday's circumstances, such an idea had no chance.  </P> <P> "No way on earth," he said. "One team was already off the field. There were  47,000 (Oriole) fans in the stands. And all the ruckus we were making?  </P> <P> "There's no way in the world that play would get overturned, even if it meant  getting it right. And that's a shame."  </P> <P> Rader said he hadn't seen a replay but also said he didn't need one.  </P> <P> "It's so obvious," he said. "That's the part that's so disturbing. It was so  obvious. That's the most frustrating thing about it all."  </P> <P> Even more so when your team wastes 19 hits -- including home runs by Dick  Schofield and Lance Parrish -- and leads of 1-0, 3-1, 7-3, 8-6 and 9-7.  </P> <P> "That's the real shame about a game like that," Rader repeated. "So many  wonderful things by our players get overshadowed by it.  </P> <P> "Max Venable gets four hits. Who's going to remember that tomorrow? Dick  Schofield does some good things with the bat and on the basepaths. Who's going  to remember that tomorrow? The heroics by a lot of our people are going to be  completely forgotten."  </P> <P> One swing of the bat and one circle of an umpire's right arm were all it took  to rub them out.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> The Angels sent slumping pitcher Kirk McCaskill (2-5, 6.69 earned-run average  in his last seven starts) back to Los Angeles for a medical examination. Dr.  Lewis Yocum diagnosed the problem as an irritation in the joint of McCaskill's  right elbow. McCaskill received an injection and was placed on a different  dosage of the anti-inflammatory medication he had been taking. "For a long  time, it looked like his arm was tired," Angel Manager Doug Rader said.  "Considering how (little) he's pitched the last couple of years, that's to be  expected. Some fatigue has set in there, and we wanted Dr. Yocum to look at him  and check him out." Rader said he is considering skipping McCaskill's next turn  in the rotation, scheduled for Thursday in Anaheim against Detroit. "If it's in  Kirk McCaskill's best interest to take it very conservatively, then we will do  so," Rader said. "We have an off-day Wednesday, so skipping him is no big deal.  We can still keep everybody else on schedule." That would mean starting Chuck  Finley in McCaskill's place, since Finley still would have had four days' rest.  </P> <P> Mickey Tettleton's steal of third base in the fourth inning was the first by a  Baltimore catcher since Floyd Rayford accomplished it on Sept. 14, 1985. The  Orioles definitely pick their spots when they attempt this. The opposing  catcher on that date, too, was Lance Parrish, then playing for the Detroit  Tigers.  </P> <P> Baltimore's Phil Bradley saw his 16-game hitting streak come to an end when he  went hitless in three at-bats and five plate appearances. Bradley also walked  twice, including once with the bases loaded in the eighth inning, forcing home  Bob Melvin with Baltimore's seventh run of the evening. . . . Max Venable's  four-hit game was the first of his career. It came against the team that  released him before the 1988 season, which resulted in Venable sitting out the  year before signing a minor-league contract with the Angels last winter.  </P></p>

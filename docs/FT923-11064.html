			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / LDP tightens grip on power in Japan: Miyazawa pledges reforms after low turnout JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) tightened its hold on power yesterday by capturing more than half of the 127 seats being contested in an upper House election conspicuous for a record low turnout. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, surprised by a turnout estimated at 48 per cent, well below the previous low of 57 per cent, promised to introduce electoral reforms to increase confidence in the political system. Meanwhile, Mr Makoto Tanabe, leader of the Social Democratic party (SDPJ), the leading opposition party, was under pressure to resign to take responsibility for the party's poor showing. The trade union-backed Rengo, an ally of the SDPJ, failed to win a single seat. Early today, final results showed that the LDP had won 68 of the seats contested in the election for half the total seats in the House. This was four more than its official target and enough for Mr Miyazawa to interpret the outcome as a vote of confidence in his leadership. The SDPJ won 22 seats, while the New Japan party, a new centrist party that hopes to usurp the SDPJ as the main opposition party, collected four seats in its first election and could play a significant role in a general election due in 1994. Opposition parties had viewed the election as a referendum on LDP legislation to allow the dispatch of military personnel on United Nations peace-keeping operations, but most Japanese voters were unimpressed by the opposition's campaign. Japan's economic slowdown worked in favour of the ruling party, as opposition parties did not offer an alternative economic policy. Mr Miyazawa had called an emergency cabinet meeting on Friday to discuss the ailing stock-market and to reinforce his party's economic credentials. The LDP, which controls the more powerful lower House, will still be a few seats short of a majority in the upper House, but is now in a strong position to regain control at the next half-house election in 1995. Mr Tanabe admitted that the SDPJ has 'defects'. However, he said that, rather than resign, he should 'take responsibility for overcoming these defects'.</p>

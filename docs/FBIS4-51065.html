			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 23 May (XINHUA) -- The CPC Central  Committee General Office recently issued a circular asking all  localities to organize the vast number of cadres into studying  modern scientific and technological knowledge. The following is  the full text of the circular:    The world's current high and new technology development  keeps  on changing and international competition in science and  technology is intensifying. If we do not take firm measures to  equip our party members and cadres with modern scientific and  technological knowledge as well as upgrade the level of the  entire Chinese people in scientific education, it is impossible  to gain the initiative in international competition. Therefore,  the party Central Committee has decided that while earnestly  studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics as well as the socialist market  economic theory and fundamental knowledge, all party comrades  must earnestly study modern scientific and technological  knowledge.    In studying modern scientific and technological knowledge,  it  is necessary to study the Marxist fundamental viewpoint on  science and technology. In particular, it is necessary to study  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important expositions, firmly establish  the concept of "science and technology is the primary productive  force," and more conscientiously implement the principle of  "economic construction cannot do without science and technology,  and scientific and technological work must be geared to economic  construction." It is necessary to realistically shift economic  construction and social development onto the path of relying on  scientific and technological progress and upgrading workers'  quality. It is necessary to become more familiar with the  fundamental knowledge of modern science and technology,  understand current the revolutionary trend in the world's new  technology, comprehend the general pattern of scientific and  technological progress, and upgrade cadres' quality in  scientific education as a whole. We must conscientiously apply  scientific and technological theory, knowledge, and methods to  observe and handle problems, as well as continue to  scientifically upgrade our policy-making capability and work  level. "Fundamental Knowledge in Modern Science and  Technology," a book proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin and compiled  under the leadership of the State Science Commission, discusses  in a simple and profound manner new knowledge and progress in  the world's scientific and technological development, as well as  our countermeasures. It can be used as a rudimentary textbook  for cadres to study modern scientific and technological  knowledge.    Party committees at all levels must outline specific plans  for cadres to study modern scientific and technological  knowledge, and conduct regular supervision and inspection.  Leading cadres must take an exemplary lead by studying the  subject well. Party schools at all levels and cadre training  institutions of various categories must incorporate the teaching  of modern scientific and technological knowledge into cadres'  training plans. They should closely cooperate with science  commissions and science associations at all levels as well as  local scientific research institutes and institutes of higher  learning to effectively plan for teaching courses and to select  the teaching force. While concentrating on self-study, working  cadres should avail themselves of flexible, varied, and  effective study and guidance. Press and propaganda departments  should coordinate closely with cadres' study by increasing their  publicity of science and technology as well as vigorously  popularizing modern scientific and technological knowledge.</p>

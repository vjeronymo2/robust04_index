			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Freedom Alliance partners are meeting behind  closed doors tonight in the wake of the latest concessions on  constitutional negotiations put forward by the ANC [African  National Congress] yesterday, but it appears that the Freedom  Alliance is not impressed with the latest proposals. At Ulundi  today IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader and kwaZulu Chief  Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi said it was incorrect to describe  the latest proposals as concessions. Other members of the  Freedom Alliance said the ANC was conducting a publicity  exercise. Conrad Burke reports:    [Begin recording] [Burke] Last night Mr. Mandela said the  ANC  had agreed to a double ballot, virtual entrenchment of regional  constitutions, and greater regional taxation powers. [passage  omitted]    But, says Dr. Buthelezi and the Afrikaner Volksfront's  [Afrikaner National Front] General Constand Viljoen, the wording  is vague, they did not like negotiations by press conference,  and the whole issue would have to be thrashed out by the Freedom  Alliance partners.    [Buthelezi] All that they are referring to is a package  which  Mr. Meyer, the minister of constitutional development, offered  to Freedom Alliance negotiators about two weeks ago. It was a  package which started with the ballot paper, a double ballot,  etc., which came from the National Party, which did not go far  enough to address the issue of the powers of regions. I mean,  to make certain that there are powers, because even Mr. Mandela  in his statement just vaguely spoke about powers of regions, in  a vague sort of way. While one welcomes the idea that  parliament should be called -- because I think that decision  needs to serve as a positive thing -- that they are prepared to  call parliament. One hopes that they are going to use the time  now, you know, to really, you know, just take that extra mile.    [Viljoen] And the question we ask is: Will there really be a  volkstaat [homeland], because we want the interim constitution  amended to such an extent that we would like to have the  volkstaat? My people are claiming the volkstaat to be in  position before 27 April. Now there is no indication to us that  this is a finality, and the Afrikaner will not be able to be  appeased by anything but a very substantial proof that what we  have in mind for the Afrikaner will eventually materialize.  [passage omitted]    Pan-Africanist Congress leader Clarence Makwetu said the  organization was still studying the package. He couldn't decide  yet whether it amounted to a significant offer.    [Makwetu] We are not quite certain whether they are  concessions. [end recording]</p>

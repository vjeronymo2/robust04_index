			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GREENBELT PENALTY  </P> <P> I was reading the hilarious story about the homeowner who ignored several  stop-work orders from the California Coastal Commission (May 11), went ahead  with the construction of his 6,000-square-foot house and get this -- it gets  funnier and funnier; then a preservation agency gave him $50,000 to help him  pay $165,000 for 2.3-square acres of permanent greenbelt that will enhance his  house. This fine citizen has "promised not to build on it."  </P> <P> Under these terms he won't be penalized!  </P> <P> This is a penalty? Anyone who can afford to spend at the very least $600,000 on  construction costs and then receive more than 30% towards the purchase of 2.3  acres of greenbelt that will only improve his property -- well, this man is a  genius. He has been given a reward for ignoring the commission's stop orders.  The punch line: "This sends a message out to people who violate the Coastal  Act, that they have to play by the same rules as everybody else." What rubbish!  </P> <P> ANDREAS G.

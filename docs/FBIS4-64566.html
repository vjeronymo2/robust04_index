			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Ruehe: Don't Lift Weapons Embargo </F> Against Bosnia"]    [Text] Defense Minister Volker Ruehe has warned the United  States against a premature unilateral lifting of the arms  embargo vis-a-vis the Bosnian Government. Ruehe said in  Washington that he would consider that to be a wrong move.  Concerning the U.S. Congress and its efforts to lift the  embargo, he said the United States and Europe must not diverge  on this issue. The main objective, he said, is to prevent the  Bosnian war from spreading to other localities, and to set the  peace process in motion once again.    The war in the Balkans was one of the main topics of Ruehe's  talks with U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry and acting  Secretary of State Strobe Talbott. In their discussion about  the situation in the Balkans, the interlocutors agreed that  despite the threatened use of air strikes, the attempt to subdue  the Serbs had not succeeded. The U.S. Department of Defense  does not consider the use of air strikes a suitable method of  proving the West's assertiveness indefinitely. As for the  deployment of land forces, there is no public approval for such  an idea, and no peace plan supported by at least one of the  parties to the Balkan conflict. In addition, such an operation  would create more victims than the Gulf war.    Ruehe indicated that one was now going to consider ways of  meeting halfway Serbian attempts to use a kind of evasive action  in order to spread the war to other areas. He did not wish to  divulge any details, but observers think he meant an expansion  of the safety zone. A high-ranking Pentagon employee said now  is a good time for diplomatic steps to be made, because the  Russians have lost their patience with the Serbs and the siege  of Gorazde has revealed to the Muslims the military weaknesses  of the Serbs. But the American side expressed concern about the  restricted military maneuvering space. It was said that the  threat of air strikes already represents a high degree of  military pressure that can hardly be exceeded. What else, it  was asked, can be achieved on a military level if the Serbs  withstand a bombardment?    The politicians discussed at length NATO cooperation with  Russia, and hoped that Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev  will sign the Partnership for Peace agreement when he visits  NATO headquarters in Brussels at the end of May. NATO's offer  of cooperation is receiving various reviews in Moscow. Plans  for a Russian-American joint maneuver this year are not  receiving further consideration for the time being.    Ruehe explained to his interlocutors his plans for the  restructuring of the Bundeswehr, and encountered approval.  Defense Secretary Perry supported his plan to reduce the  personnel level of the army, before a "hollow army" emerges.  Apart from that, said Ruehe, for the sake of future Bundeswehr  tasks, it is important to establish strong and efficient  crisis-reaction forces. Ruehe explained that as a result of the  Constitutional Court's ruling, the restructuring of the army  could now be planned. But according to the Pentagon, the  reduction of European armies makes it difficult to justify to  Congress the presence of 100,000 American soldiers in Europe.  In any case, the U.S. Government is not considering any  reduction in U.S. troops in Europe.</p>

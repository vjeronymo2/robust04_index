			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Large British companies suffered minor decline BRITAIN'S large companies suffered a minor decline in their liquidity position in the third quarter of this year, according to figures released yesterday by the Central Statistical Office. The CSO reported that the estimated liquidity ratio for all large UK industrial and commercial companies was 122 per cent at the end of the third quarter against 123 per cent at the end of June. The ratio, which measures current assets maturing in less than a year as a share of liabilities that have to be repaid in less than a year, was substantially higher than the 113 per cent level at the end of September 1991 and well above the level of the late 1980s. The liquidity ratio for large manufacturing companies slipped to 114 per cent at the end of September from 115 per cent in June while that of non-manufacturing companies, including oil companies, slipped to 132 per cent from 134 per cent.</p>

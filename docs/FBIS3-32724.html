			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Carmen Elida Contreras] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Raul  Mulino rejected statements made in Washington by Robert Gelbard,  U.S. assistant deputy secretary for Inter-American Affairs.  Gelbard warned the United States could reduce its aid to  countries, like Panama, which have not curbed drug trafficking.    "Expressing criticism that does not seriously reflect the  true attitude and determination of the Panamanian Government in  its fight against this powerful and international network of  crimes is unacceptable," Mulino warned in a note sent to Deane  Hinton, U.S. ambassador to Panama.    On 10 February, Gelbard told the international press that  the  Clinton administration is studying the possibility of cutting  aid to countries like Panama, Bolivia, Peru, and other  drug-producing countries or countries where drug traffickers  operate and where they have not been punished.    Mulino recalled that since 1990, the Panamanian Government  has been taking "serious and decisive" actions to fight the  laundering of drug money.    "I reiterate my concern for the inexplicable delay the U.S.  Senate has experienced in ratifying the Mutual Legal Assistance  Treaty on penal matters, signed by the United States and Panama  in April 1991," and which has been approved by the Panamanian  Legislative Assembly.    According to the diplomat, all these years of postponements  with respect to this important legal instrument "undermines your  government official's authority to criticize."    In his letter, the foreign minister chronologically recounts  at least 12 measures Panama has taken against drug trafficking  as well as the agreements and treaties signed with other  countries.    Mulino adds that "not even the United States, with all its  resources, has been able to effectively control drug  consumption. But this real impossibility is not an excuse to  carelessly say that this government is not working to control"  this problem.</p>

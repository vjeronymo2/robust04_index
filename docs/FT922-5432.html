			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Hungary accused on van tariff WESTERN vehicle companies yesterday accused Hungary of violating international trade agreements by giving customs preferences to Ford as a reward for making investments in Hungary. The protest followed a government decree which set an 18 per cent tariff on imported vans - with exemption for vehicles with specifications which, in practice, are met only by Ford Transit models. The timing of the new tariffs, just as the US carmaker opened an Dollars 83m (Pounds 46m) components plant in western Hungary and announced a further Dollars 18m investment, heightened suspicions that the tariff rules have been re-written to make the investment more attractive. The Hungarian Association of Vehicle Importers, representing Fiat, Renault and other foreign companies, issued a furious statement that the customs preferences broke Hungary's international commitments by discriminating against specific products. Neither Ford nor the Hungarian government denied the claims but government officials argued that as Budapest had not explicitly named any particular company in the customs decree it had not broken any international rules. The new burst of protectionism follows the tightening of car import quotas this year in response to appeals by Suzuki of Japan and General Motors of the US, which have both built car plants in Hungary. Ironically, western multinationals have become eastern Europe's most effective lobby for protection and their efforts to link investment commitments to guaranteed markets have become all the more intense as local demand has fallen below expectations. The latest dispute echoes a recent case in Poland where Warsaw divided a 50,000-car import quota among just three western companies which were investing in the country. That row prompted appeals to the European Commission in Brussels by other importers which had been excluded from the deal. This week's accusations of illegal trading practices come at an awkward time for Hungary, which is waiting for ratification of its EC association agreement by EC parliaments and cannot afford to alienate important west European lobbies.</p>

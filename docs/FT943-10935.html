			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / International Company News: US and Japan groups in Dollars 500m chip move Texas Instruments of the US and Hitachi of Japan have agreed to form a joint venture to build a Dollars 500m semiconductor chip plant in Texas. It will be the first joint venture semiconductor manufacturing facility in the US. The companies announced plans to begin construction of the plant next year, with production to begin in 1996. The plant will produce 16 and 64 megabit dynamic random-access memory chips (D-Rams) - the next two generations of data storage chips for use in a broad variety of computer and consumer electronics products. TI and Hitachi will hold a majority equity stake in the joint venture and plan to seek equity investments from other parties. All products produced at the plant will go directly to TI and Hitachi for sale to their customers. The joint venture is subject to regulatory approval in the US. The joint venture follows six years of research and development collaboration between TI and Hitachi on successive generations of memory chips. Rising costs have led to several collaborative efforts in the memory chip business including another TI joint venture with Acer of Taiwan.</p>

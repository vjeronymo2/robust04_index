			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Arts: Today's Television It is right that television should be doing whatever it can to ease the problems of the homeless, though experience over some decades should have taught us by now that, with homelessness as with violence, television has precious little effect. As part of its 'Gimme Shelter' season, Channel 4 repeats the famous 1966 BBC drama Cathy Come Home (10.35). In its time this was thought to be tremendously influential; it was regarded as a truism that it led directly to the formation of the charity Shelter, even though Des Wilson, who ran Shelter, denies it. And today there are more homeless in Britain than when the drama was first shown. Better, however, to see it and have your heartstrings tugged than not to see it. In Bookmark Simon Armitage goes in search of fellow poet Weldon Kees who, in 1955, abandoned his car on the Golden Gate Bridge and disappeared (8.10 BBC2). The same channel screens the second episode of Goggle Eyes (9.25) the story of a new man in the life of a one-parent family, with splendid performances from Honeysuckle Weeks and Victoria Shalet as sisters.</p>

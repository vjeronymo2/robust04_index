			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Number of big employers falls The past decade has witnessed a shift in employment away from the large employer, according to figures published today. At the same time there has been a jump in the number of people with the power to take on or shed staff. The figures from the Department of Employment show that most people in work are now employed by businesses with fewer than 100 people. The figures, compiled by Vista Communications, employment consultants, show the extent of the decline of the large company. The report says that there were 300,000 more businesses employing 100 people or fewer in 1991 than there were in 1981. During the same 10-year period the number of companies employing more than 500 people fell 25 per cent. 'The effect of this change is to create nearly a third of a million more chief executives with the power to hire and fire,' Mr Peter Walker, Vista's managing director, writes in the report. The report identifies two main reasons for the growth of small businesses. First, a federalisation of large conglomerates and public utilities has been caused by the need to control costs and act more flexibly towards the customer. Second, technology is allowing companies to concentrate on core business and contract out the supply of goods and services where necessary. 'This can be seen particularly in electronics where it is now almost impossible to purchase a product which is wholly manufactured by one company,' says Mr Walker. He adds that the new breed of managing director needs to be more responsive to employees.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Belgian Banking and Finance (7): Facts prove stronger than ideology - The progess of Belgium's modest privatisation programme October 4, 1993, was an important date for the Belgian government. It was on that day that the first piece of the the centre-left coalition's BFr85bn four-year privatisation programme was put in place - the sale of 49.9 per cent of CGER-ASLK, a network of insurance and banking branches. Although the BFr35bn paid by Fortis, the Dutch-Belgian financial services group, more than meets the government's goal for privatisation in 1993, the significance of the purchase was not so much its size as the speed with which it was achieved and the way in which ideological preconceptions were jettisoned once the sell-off got under way. The Belgian privatisation programme is modest, mainly because Belgium did not nationalise large chunks of its economy after the war (unlike France and Britain). There is, quite simply, not much the Belgian government can sell off before it runs up against the political complexities of privatising postal and rail services - sensitive areas which even the British government has left until last. The current centre-left coalition took power in Belgium only 20 months ago. Felicitously for Hill Samuel, the British merchant bank, and Petercam Securities of Brussels, the formation of the coalition coincided with the publication of a study they had commissioned, estimating for the first time the value of state holdings in Belgium at a total of BFr318bn. As Petercam's directors now freely admit, injecting some round figures into the debate seemed to give energy to a government which had to raise money fast to curb its growing budget deficit. 'Before that, people had only philosophical debate about it, and we said: let's take philosophy out and find facts,' says Mr Alain Camu, a director of Petercam and Hill Samuel. Nonetheless, the speed with which the government moved was remarkable. This was no hard-line Thatcherite coalition but an uneasy alliance of Christian Democrats and socialists - not the world's most enthusiastic privatisers. But by Christmas 1992, the government had rewarded Petercam with a mandate to organise the sale of a 'significant' part of CGER-ASLK. A bulky 'memorandum' on the group was prepared and sold to five potential buyers in April. By the beginning of October, the deal was signed. The only ideological skirmish was fought last year when Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, upset his socialist coalition partners by indicating that there was nothing to stop potential buyers purchasing more than 50 per cent in state enterprises. In the end, the legislation governing CGER-ASLK was amended with hardly a murmur from the socialists in September this year, to allow the sale of a majority stake. Fortis now has an option to increase its holding to 50 per cent from January 1, 1995, and the state holding company can, if it so wishes, sell a further 9.8 per cent to the Dutch-Belgian venture. Mr Maurice Lippens, chairman of Fortis, says the idea of buying the state-owned banking and insurance group had not occurred to his company before the beginning of the year, simply because it was felt that CGER-ASLK was not for sale. It was at a lunch in January with Mr Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian finance minister, that Mr Lippens first suggested that Fortis would be interested. In fact, when the interested parties were whittled down to just two, Fortis was the only serious bidder. The other proposal, from Generale de Banque, was to pilot CGER-ASLK to a public flotation. Petercam points out that the government itself was not directly involved in the day-to-day process of privatisation. The advisers dealt mainly with the state holding company, which decided against a flotation, principally because the price would have been unsatisfactory. Petercam points out that the French government's sale of Banque Nationale de Paris to small shareholders, though hailed as a great public relations success, realised only 70 per cent of the state-owned bank's net asset value. Generale de Banque was disappointed by the decision. Floating CGER-ASLK, or a part of it, would have given new energy to the stock market, the bank argued, benefiting the whole economy. But the Belgian government was constrained by its tight timetable and tough targets for privatisation proceeds - BFr25bn this year, BFr40bn next, BFr10bn in 1995 and the same again in 1996. It did not have time to prepare a full-scale public flotation. Given the constraints, is there still a chance of a public flotation in Belgium? Mr Maystadt has always said that Belgacom, the state telecommunications company, might be a candidate for a public sell-off. He is determined that part of Belgacom will be sold, possibly as early as the end of next year. But the government could face some stiff opposition - both from socialists within its own ranks, and from Mr Bessel Kok, the pugnacious chief executive of Belgacom, who argues that readying the group for pan-European liberalisation of telephone services puts Belgacom under enough pressure, without also having to bear the burden of a quick privatisation. Easier targets for the next stage of privatisation are the credit institutions, SNCI-NMKN (which offers credit to Belgian industry through a network of independent agents), and OCCH-CBHK, a mortgage lender. Mr Maystadt believes SNCI-NMKN will prove interesting to foreign banks, and expects to begin a public auction before the end of the year. By contrast, there is growing controversy over the sale of SNI-NIM, a state holding company, one of the most complex candidates for privatisation. The Antwerp-based industrial holding company, Ackermans &amp; van Haaren, has put together a bid for SNI-NIM, in alliance with other interested parties. This is now being scrutinised by the government. The proposal is said to be worth some BFr18bn and is probably the most realistic offer on the table. But it is bound to cause the government some headaches: Ackermans has indicated that it will let its bid lapse if a decision is not taken by the end of the year, and the Belgian finance ministry is said to want at least BFr15bn from the sale for its 1993 accounts. But the sensitivity of some of SNI-NIM's energy holdings - notably a 50 per cent stake in Distrigaz, the Belgian gas distribution and supply monopoly - means that the government will almost certainly have to consider the possibility of taking a 'golden share' to defuse political controversy over the sale.</p>

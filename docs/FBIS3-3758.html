Since the adoption of the reform and opening up policy,  Inner  Mongolia has achieved rapid economic and social progress, and  the living standards of its people of various nationalities have  improved substantially. Owing to historical, geographical, and  social factors, however, the region remains quite underdeveloped  when compared with developed areas. While Premier Li Peng says  in his government work report that "it takes time before such a  situation can be changed once and for all," what Wang Qun,  secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party  Committee, is thinking about is how to shorten the time as much  as possible.    Wang Qun said: To speed up the development under market  economic conditions, we must have new ideas and merge Inner  Mongolia's economic development and the central government's  macroeconomic regulation and control and strategy. We also must  establish our footing in relying on our own efforts, bring our  local resources into play, and work hard according to the law of  market economy. By doing this we can keep our own initiative  and achieve a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic  development. Under the new situation, we will miss the good  opportunities if we wait and hesitate.    Wang Qun said: To develop our economy under the new  situation, our remote minority region must reassess its  strengths and weaknesses. Inner Mongolia is a big place with  rich natural resources. We have an area that is one-eighth of  the national total, but we have only 22 million people. Our  potential for developing farming, animal husbandry, village and  town enterprises, energy and raw material industries is great  and our market is huge. Now the state has brought the policy of  supporting and promoting minority areas' economic development  into its macroeconomic regulation and control and will give  minority areas even greater support in terms of investment and  preferential measures, we should say that this has provided  Inner Mongolia with a historical opportunity for development.    Feeling a little excited at this time, Wang Qun continued:  "Facing such an opporrunity, the vast number of cadres and  people in Inner Mongolia must do away with their outmoded  concepts that took shape under the planned economic system that  had gone on for a long time; heighten their awareness about  information, the market, opening up, economic returns,  competition, and the law; and understand and master objective  laws about the market economy, such as laws governing value,  supply and demand, and competition."    Commenting on cooperation between Inner Mongolia and  neighboring regions and developed areas, Wang Qun said that the  economic development in Inner Mongolia and those areas can be  complementary. He said: Inner Mongolia can at least become a  base producing meat and nonstaple foodstuffs for northeast and  north China. Grain is a special commodity, and Inner Mongolia  can provide them with large quantities of wheat, corn, soybean,  and other miscellaneous cereal crops of good quality. Because  Inner Mongolia has plenty of raw materials and fuel resources,  we can serve as a powerful base for material and fuel supply for  coastal areas in east China and other economically developed  areas enjoying fast industrial growth. Generally speaking,  people in Inner Mongolia are not very well trained; but we can  use the vast personnel markets. We can send people to study and  receive training in the South, and we can also hire people in  the South to give full scope to their abilities in Inner  Mongolia.    Wang Qun said: Opening up to the outside world is another  important respect. The region's total imports and exports in  1993 topped that of the previous year by 28 percent, reaching  $1.2 billion. The region also made substantial headway in 1993  with regard to utilizing foreign capital, investing in areas  outside the region, contracting foreign construction projects,  and exporting labor services. Inner Mongolia shares a  4,200-kilometer long border with Russia and the People's  Republic of Mongolia, and its 18 border towns are playing an  increasingly important role. Many leagues, banners, and  counties are actively bringing in the foreign capital they need  for upgrading the technology of their enterprises so their goods  can become more competitive in the world market. The world  markets for the region's agricultural and livestock products,  construction materials, alkaline-based chemical goods, and coal  are broadening.    Wang Qun concluded: While Inner Mongolia will establish the  footing of its economic development in the domestic market, we  will also explore the world market so that these two markets can  promote one another. Only by doing this can we train a large  number of capable personnel; set up a great number of  competitive enterprises; improve the efficiency, quality, and  exchange-earning capability of our farming and animal husbandry.  By then, the economic development of our remote, minority  region will have a greater vitality and will have reached a  higher level.</p>

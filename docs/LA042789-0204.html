Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> AIDS-STRICKEN GIRL ENTERS SCHOOL  </P> <P> A mentally disabled, AIDS-stricken 7-year-old stepped into a classroom for the  first time in her life today, with bows in her hair, a knapsack on her back and  the cheers of supporters surrounding her.  </P> <P> Her adoptive mother, Rosa Martinez, who fought a 2 1/2-year court battle  against school officials who feared a health risk and had required that the  girl be confined to a glass isolation booth, called today the most important  day in her daughter Eliana's life.  </P> <P> Supporters cheered as mother and daughter walked into the one-story, red-brick  Manhattan Exceptional Center, where 201 students are enrolled. Eliana's teacher  said many pupils hugged the girl when she came into their classroom.  </P> <P> Martinez is a nurse who adopted Eliana as an infant in her native Puerto Rico.  Eliana was stricken with AIDS after receiving transfusions of tainted blood  shortly after her premature birth.  </P></p>

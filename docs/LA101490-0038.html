			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE ISSUES  </P> <P> The candidates' positions are not very dissimilar, as the Oct. 7 debate  illustrated. Oh, a few differences, but not enough to sway a vote.  </P> <P> Now, once again in an important race, the voting public is down to judging  personality, leadership and backbone; and during the debate, Dianne Feinstein  seemed the more comfortable in expressing leadership and drive. Here,  Feinstein's experience with adversity stands her in good stead . . . her  balance in guiding the San Francisco city government back into healthy  re-emergence after a scarring, murderous day in its history. She leaves no  doubt of her ability to deal with the likes of Assembly Speaker Willie Brown  and Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti and handle the rough-and-tumble  politics of Sacramento.  </P> <P> I do doubt Pete Wilson's ability to provide leadership under stress. He has  always played it safe on the issues and followed wherever opinion polls or  powerful constituencies led him. In the debate, he expressed his hesitancy at  handling Brown, Roberti, et al, preferring a "term limits" removal of these  difficult legislators. I personally could respect Sen. Wilson if he would spend  time in Washington trying to help solve the budget impasse -- this is what we  elected him to do, and he could gain ground publicly by demonstrating  statesmanship in a crucial situation.  </P> <P> Wilson doesn't flunk as a public representative, because he does respond to  public opinion in a good-natured way, but he is a follower and not on the  stellar level where Feinstein comfortably demonstrates her leadership and  drive.  </P> <P> JACQUELINE KERR  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

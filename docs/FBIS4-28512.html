			<p>BFN     [Text] For one hour this morning, U.S. Forces Korea [USFK]  opened one battery of Patriot missiles to ROK and foreign  reporters at the air base in Osan, Kyonggi Province, and  demonstrated its operation.    The battery opened to reporters today is under one battalion  deployed to the USFK at the beginning of April. It is composed  of a command vehicle, a communications vehicle, a radar, a  generator vehicle, and eight launching pads.    The USFK disclosed that the Patriot missiles are capable of  defending areas as far as Seoul, in addition to the Osan base,  adding that they are ready for combat anytime now that they are  on an around-the-clock readiness posture.    About 40 reporters, including some 30 foreign  correspondents,  engaged in fierce competition today to cover the Patriot  missiles, thereby showing the foreign media's deep interest in  the current security situation surrounding the Korean peninsula  related to the North's nuclear development.</p>

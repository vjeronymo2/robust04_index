			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> TEACHER PAID $5,000 IN LIBEL CASE SETTLEMENT  </P> <P> A former science teacher at Leuzinger High School in Lawndale, who was accused  but never tried on charges that he had sex with a 16-year-old student, has  accepted $5,000 to settle a libel suit against the Centinela Valley Union High  School District and former school board member Robert Kruse.  </P> <P> Charles Conn accepted the settlement last week shortly after the start of the  libel trial against Kruse and the school district in Los Angeles Superior  Court.  </P> <P> Conn claimed he was libeled in 1983 when Kruse released a copy of a  confidential school district memo to the Daily Breeze, which published a story  about his alleged sexual liaison with the girl.  </P> <P> Conn sued the school district and Kruse, but not the newspaper.  </P> <P> Kruse, the husband of Lawndale Mayor Sarann Kruse, resigned from the school  board in the uproar that followed publication of the story. He later was  elected to be a trustee in the Lawndale School District.  </P> <P> Conn still works for the Centinela Valley district as a biology teacher at  Hawthorne High School.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> MAN SURRENDERS AFTER BRIEF STANDOFF  </P> <P> A 34-year-old Costa Mesa man on crutches surrendered to police after a brief  standoff Monday morning with a police SWAT team, authorities said.  </P> <P> Witnesses said the man, Randy Steve Malett, had threatened to kill two  neighbors and had smashed the front window of the neighbors' home with one of  his crutches, according to authorities.  </P> <P> Gunshots were also heard, but no weapon was found, Costa Mesa police said.  </P> <P> The incident began, authorities said, when Malett had an argument late Sunday  or early Monday with his neighbors, Christopher and Cynthia Laughery, at the  Laugherys' residence in the 2200 block of Thurin Avenue.  </P> <P> Later, while watching television with roommates Kelly Ramey, 22, and Anthony  Mondragon, 24, police said, Malett threatened to kill the Laugherys.  </P> <P> Costa Mesa Police Lt. Tom Warnack said that at 3:50 a.m. Malett went outside,  started a disturbance and used one of his crutches to smash the Laugherys'  front window. Several people reported hearing gunshots but saw no weapon, he  said.  </P> <P> Warnack said Malett returned to his residence. Police, responding to a call  about a disturbance and possible shots fired, evacuated Malett's roommates,  including three small children.  </P> <P> A SWAT unit and a crisis response team arrived at 5 a.m., Warnack said, and  they set up a command post at the corner of Thurin and Victoria Street. A  negotiation team telephoned Malett and he later surrendered.  </P> <P> Warnack said Malett was being held at the Costa Mesa jail on suspicion of  disturbing the peace and malicious mischief. Bail was set at $500.  </P></p>

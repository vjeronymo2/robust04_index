			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> $100,000 SETTLEMENT IN OCTD INJURY  </P> <P> An elderly woman whose shoulder was torn as she stepped off a bus in 1987 will  receive $100,000 from the Orange County Transit District, an unusually large  payment by the agency in a personal-injury action, officials said Monday.  </P> <P> Under terms of a settlement reached in Orange County Superior Court last  Thursday, Mildred Cole, 70, will receive $20,000 to cover the cost of two  surgeries and another $80,000 for future medical bills and pain and suffering,  said Ronald C. Staff, claims administrator for the OCTD.  </P> <P> The payment stemmed from an accident at a bus stop at Bristol and Myrtle  streets in Santa Ana, said Cole's lawyer, Michael E. Caston. Cole was stepping  down from a bus but caught her hand in the rear door handle, he said. Before  she could disengage herself, the bus driver started to pull away, tearing the  connecting ligaments in Cole's shoulder.  </P> <P> Cole, who lives on Social Security, required two operations to repair her  shoulder and might need a third, Staff said. Her range of motion in that  shoulder is still limited, Caston said.  </P> <P> Staff said the settlement is the second largest against the OCTD in this fiscal  year, which ends June 30.

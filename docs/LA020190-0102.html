			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOTEL HOLDS COURT TO MEET CASE BACKLOG  </P> <P> Themis, the goddess of justice, might want to let go of the scales and lift her  blindfold long enough to take a peek at this one: a Superior Court trial where  the jurors sip ice water from long-stemmed glasses, the witness stand is  festooned with a white-linen table skirt and the judge's chambers has a  built-in mahogany vanity.  </P> <P> It's a court trial all right, but it isn't going on at the overcrowded,  worse-for-wear Long Beach courthouse. It's in the California Room at the  Holiday Inn, right along with the "Stamp Out Foot Problems with Dr. Jeffrey"  seminar.  </P> <P> The courthouse has been stretched to its limits for years with an overwhelming  number of felony criminal cases -- 3,271 in 1989 to be exact -- more than half  of them drug-related, said Supervising Superior Court Judge Richard F. Charvat.  </P> <P> Eight of the nine judges at the courthouse are assigned to hear criminal cases  just to keep up with the busloads of defendants who have a right to go to trial  within 60 days or have their charges dismissed.  </P> <P> That left just one judge and one courtroom in the courthouse to handle more  than 1,700 civil matters also awaiting trial in Long Beach.  </P> <P> Observers have been warning for years that the courthouse would one day  overflow. It finally did, right into the cylinder-shaped hotel at Lakewood  Boulevard and the San Diego Freeway.  </P> <P> "We're in desperate need of a new facility or additional courtrooms, something  that is not about to happen from what I have been told," Charvat said. "Long  Beach can handle its own criminal load, but the sacrifice is that civil cases  don't get the attention they deserve. And as a result, they get tried in hotel  rooms."  </P> <P> At $125 a day for the room and $450 a day for the rented services of retired  Superior Court Judge Carroll M. Dunnum, Los Angeles County is finally giving  73-year-old William Rathje his day in court.  </P> <P> Rathje contends that his wife, Netta, shot herself to death in their Lake  Elsinore home at the age of 69 after she was diagnosed as having intestinal  cancer, treated for 15 months, then told she never had cancer in the first  place.  </P> <P> He is suing a Riverside radiation group and a Long Beach psychiatrist, both of  whom contend their encounter with the woman was brief and unrelated to her  suicide nearly two years later.  </P> <P> The case was filed almost five years ago -- the limit within which the law says  civil cases must be brought to trial.  </P> <P> While Long Beach has often taken advantage of the county's so-called  "rent-a-judge" program that hires retired judges to clear backlogged calendars,  the city has always managed to find a spare courtroom.  </P> <P> But an increasing number of drug cases and the city's growing population have  outstripped court facilities that have not expanded since the courthouse was  built in the 1960s, Charvat said.  </P> <P> Lawyers were apprehensive at first that it would be difficult to keep an air of  decorum while holding court on a green and purple geometric carpet. But the  consensus, so far, is that justice is even better served at the Holiday Inn.  </P> <P> Court starts precisely at 9:30 a.m. because the judge isn't juggling a dozen  other matters. There is plenty of parking; fresh ice water is delivered twice a  day and the 13th-floor restaurant with a panoramic view of Long Beach puts the  courthouse snack bar to shame.  </P> <P> When court officials worried that the judge and the witness stand were at an  undignified eye-level with the jury, the hotel moved in a platform, complete  with a purple skirt, to lift them to a more stately height.  </P> <P> The judge misses his law library and private bathroom, but those minor  inconveniences are more than offset by five solid hours of court time he says  is put in daily, because there are no interruptions.  </P> <P> "You're lucky if you get three or 3 1/2 hours in at the courthouse," Dunnum  said from his "chambers," a makeshift room behind a movable wall. "Here you  don't have attorneys and processors running in and out and slamming doors and  bodies rushing all around. And we can sit and guzzle ice water all day."  </P> <P> Officials say hotel trials, which have been successful in Torrance and Santa  Monica, could offer a much-needed reprieve in Long Beach, where one civil court  judge struggles to do the work of four who sit in some branch courts.  </P> <P> "If it wasn't for the Holiday Inn," said plaintiff's attorney John Thornton,  "we'd still be waiting."  </P></p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (31): Motors pioneer steers clear of equities - Serious Riches / On holiday, John Madejski found a new way to advertise cars for sale. It made his fortune John Madejski opens his own front door despite being the 85th richest person in Britain, making him worth about Pounds 140m, according to the Sunday Times' annual tot-up of the nation's 500 wealthiest people. He neither inherited wealth nor made a fortune on the stock market. He did what many Englishmen - for despite his exotic surname, Madejski has no foreign blood - often complain they are not much good at: he started and built up his own company, which has become one of the UK's most successful private enterprises. Hurst Publishing was founded in 1976 with Paul Gibbons, a colleague Madejski had met on the Reading Evening Post where they both sold advertising in the early 1970s. The company publishes Auto Trader, a magazine which anyone who has tried to sell a car or buy one second-hand, is almost certain to have come across. The secret of the magazine's success was the introduction of a novel feature into UK classified car advertising, and one which Madejski borrowed and extended when on a holiday in Florida he saw a magazine using photographs of the cars being advertised. The initial start-up capital for Thames Valley Trader, as the magazine was then known, was Pounds 2,000. 'We were this little tiny company, which no one took seriously, vying against the Westminster Press, The Thomson Organisation etc. We just had to turn our hands to everything, and were literally working all the hours God sent to make sure the thing got off the ground.' The idea took off, and the company has now grown to employ 920 people, and, along with GMG, with which Hurst formed an alliance in 1982, embraces 12 regional editions. The first overseas Auto Trader has just been launched into the South African market. Madejski has increased his stake in Hurst from 51 per cent at launch to 67 per cent today. The company made profits before tax of just under Pounds 5m in the year to April 1993 - up from Pounds 2.3m the previous year, according to the latest set of accounts returned to Companies House, with a dividend of Pounds 3.4m paid to its two directors. Madejski is also chairman of two other companies. He has a 57.6 per cent holding in Goodhead group, the quoted printing and publishing company and owns 89 per cent of Reading Football Club, which he saved from bankruptcy in 1990. Goodhead, which has been hard hit by the drop in advertising during the recession, appears to be gradually recovering after streamlining and focusing on its core businesses. The companies absorb Madejski's interest, and he regards them as a better investment opportunity and challenge than equities. 'It's a bit like the old cliche: what does a stockbroker do? A stockbroker invests your money until it is all gone. I prefer to put my money into things that I've got some kind of control over.' Nevertheless, he has given his bank a portfolio of about Pounds 500,000 which it manages for him. The investment that gives him the most pleasure is his superb collection of cars, ranging from the Pounds 170,000 Bentley Continental  - an elegantly powerful coupe launced in 1991 - to a vintage Jaguar. There are three Ferraris, the most prized of which is kept in a glass box on one side of the indoor gym. He also owns a Rolls-Royce and another three Jaguars, including the XJ220 model, which is one of a limited edition of only 218 cars. The classic car market has taken a battering in recent years, and Madejski says: 'I probably paid too much for it, but one day it will be worth a lot of money and will probably end up in a museum.' The cars are in immaculate condition, helped by the fact that, apart from the Rolls and Bentley, they are rarely used. 'I don't really like a car to be driven, but I do like the beauty of it,' says Madejski - a claim borne out by his failed attempts to drive out three of the beauties due to flat batteries. Although he does not need it, he took out an Abbey Life pension eight years ago at a friend's suggestion, into which he pays Pounds 20,000 a year and which he expects to be worth about Pounds 1m on maturity. This, the cars and the property he owns - houses in Berkshire, London, Caversham and Henley - should stand him in good stead were the businesses to fail. He believes that hard work - 'I find it bewildering that some Lloyd's Names expected to get something for nothing' - common sense and willingness to delegate are the main ingredients of success. 'If you don't delegate, you can't go forward. You can only do so much yourself.' From time to time, he muses on the possibility of floating Hurst Publishing, but is clearly emotionally attached to the company. 'It's a fabulous company with super people and, quite frankly, I am very proud of it. It was the business we nurtured and it's expanding all the time. While one is still enjoying it, it seems a pity to relinquish it.'</p>

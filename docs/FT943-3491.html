			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Mobile phone price fall expected The prices of mobile phones for new digital networks are set to halve by the end of the year, according to Nokia, the biggest manufacturer of handsets for the UK market. The biggest network operator, Vodafone, confirmed the Finnish supplier's projection. Mr Alex Mott, UK marketing manager for Nokia, said the price of the company's most popular GSM (digital) handset was likely to fall from about Pounds 300 to Pounds 150 by the year-end. He said the reduction would come mainly from increased subsidies paid by network operators to dealers in an attempt to encourage more subscribers to join new GSM networks. Vodafone expected digital mobile phones to retail at between Pounds 99 and Pounds 199, with most of the reduction caused by increased payments it would make to dealers. Vodafone and Cellnet are anxious to encourage greater use of their new digital networks to avoid overcrowding on older analogue networks. At the end of June Vodafone had 1.3m subscribers to its analogue network, but only 37,500 on its digital network, with high handset prices the main barrier. Handsets for analogue networks retail for as little as Pounds 50. Network operators already subsidise digital handsets by about Pounds 150 each, so new subsidies could mean handsets selling at one-third of cost price. Nokia's international mobile phone sales have grown threefold in each of the past two years, and it expects the same increase this year. It is opening a new factory in Finland and intends to expand its range of handsets. The two new digital network operators, Orange and Mercury One-2-One, will also be under pressure to cut handset prices. However, with lower call tariffs and subscription charges than their rivals, they may do so more slowly.</p>

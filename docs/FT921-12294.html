			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Letter: Tax reductions that would be misdirected Sir, A penny off corporation tax in the Budget - as suggested by the Institute of Directors ('Directors urge Pounds 3bn reduction in taxation', January 16) - would be money misdirected, besides being of no benefit to the many small businesses that operate as sole traders, whose cash position has also been ravaged by 30 per cent inflation over the last four years. Productivity may not be everything - but in the long run to a trading nation it is nearly everything. Budgetary concessions for business, then, should be aimed at stimulating investment in productive plant - to help meet demand when the upturn comes. Singularly in this country we penalise investment by not allowing adequate cost recovery against tax in the year of expenditure - the current 25 per cent diminishing balance rate is far too low. So any budgetary concessions should be used in this area to improve the cash flow of investing companies - both small and large. Vinson, 65 Kingsway, London WC2B 6QT</p>

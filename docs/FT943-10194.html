			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Equifax in talks with UAPT advisers Equifax, the US credit information business, is having talks with the advisers to UAPT-Infolink with a view to seeking a recommendation for its increased cash offer of 600p per share for the UK credit referencing company. Equifax announced a 500p recommended offer on July 26, but it was pre-empted by a rival 550p bid on Wednesday from Trans Union, another North American credit information business. Equifax responded with the 600p offer, but despite UAPT board support for the 500p bid, the increased offer has not been recommended.</p>

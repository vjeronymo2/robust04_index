			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Financial Storms"] </F>   [Text] The dollar's slide to below the 100-yen mark on  Monday, 27 June shows that the week which has just begun will be  heavy with new and dangerous storms on the financial markets.  The crisis of confidence of international investors in the  economic and monetary policies of the three major industrial  powers (the United States, Germany, and Japan) began in  February. It was to continue, severely threatening American  growth. It is compromising recovery in Japan and Europe.    Tension is running extremely high among dealers, who are  waiting expectantly for a hike in short-term American interest  rates. While waiting for this action from the Federal Reserve,  agitation can be expected to continue both in the bond markets  and on the stock exchanges. A brutal fall in the U.S. currency  or in share prices is no doubt out of the question, but  pessimism and doubt remain the order of the day, auguring what  some are beginning to call a hidden crash.    The concerted intervention by 17 central banks led by the  Federal Reserve on Friday, 24 June, ended in bitter failure.  Despite the $3 billion or so thrown into the battle, the  greenback once again lost value. It has lost 10 percent of its  value against the yen and 9 percent against the German mark  since the beginning of the year. This serious reverse suffered  by the monetary authorities underlines how much their tactical  sense has failed them. By waiting too long to intervene so as  not to prove the markets who were calling for action from them  to be right, they enabled speculators to make tidy profits  without, however, arresting the fall.    Beyond this, it is visibly their whole credibility which  this  crisis is calling into question. The messages between central  banks and the markets are not getting across any more. Every  movement on short-term rates is misinterpreted. The meaning of  every declaration is twisted. Financial circles are maintaining  a sense of alarm which can no longer be taken lightly, given its  serious threat to economies.    The White House's declarations this weekend indicating that  the dollar was not a weapon in the trade war with Japan go in  the right direction. It finally appears that the level achieved  by the yen, which is now worth 1 U.S. cent, is considered  sufficient by Washington. Despite everything, it will need more  than that to convince traders. The G-7 meeting, to be held  between 8 and 10 July in Naples, could provide an opportunity if  the date did not appear too distant.    In the meantime, the markets would like a hike in U.S.  short-term rates and a fall in Europe, just as the Fed and the  Bundesbank have decided on a pause. The central banks are  trapped, because giving in immediately to the markets would  weaken their long-term credibility. While remaining inflexible,  it remains the job of the political and monetary authorities to  remind people constantly that the fundamentals of the world  economy do not justify the present panic.</p>

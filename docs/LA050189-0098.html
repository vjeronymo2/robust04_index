			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> NIGHT STALKER WITNESS CALLED BACK  </P> <P> Prosecutors in the Night Stalker trial received permission today to briefly  reopen their case to re-question a witness they learned had not been entirely  truthful in his testimony.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan agreed to allow the prosecution to again  question the witness Tuesday morning, postponing the opening of the defense's  case until prosecutors were finished. "I'm told by the witness that something  was withheld to protect a woman," Deputy Dist. Atty. P. Philip Halpin said. "It  was a deliberate omission that amounts to an untruth."  </P> <P> Halpin refused to divulge the witness's identity until the witness begins  testifying. The prosecutor said the additional questioning should take about 10  minutes and added that the witness's testimony will not be "earth-shattering."  </P></p>

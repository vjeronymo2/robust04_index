			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Xie Ranhao [6200 3544 3185]] </F>   [Text] The Ministry of Electric Power made a point the  other day that since the advent of reforms, the Chinese electric  power industry has had great success in making use of foreign  loans. By the end of 1992, up to US$11.9 billion in loans and  gifts from foreign governments, including export credit and  mixed loans, have been used in foreign cooperative endeavors.    Zhao Xizheng, vice minister of the Ministry of Electric  Power, said that the above-mentioned loans, aid, export credit,  and mixed loans came from the World Bank, Japan Overseas  Foundation, Asian Development Bank, Kuwait-Arab Development  Foundation, Canada, France, Norway, Germany, Australia, the UK,  Sweden, Russia, Austria, the U.S., Spain, Belgium, Denmark, and  Finland. Through the use of this US$11.9 million, 55 projects  have been completed or are now under construction, including 23  thermal power plant projects, 16 hydropower station projects, 1  nuclear power plant, and 5 power transmission projects. The  total installed electric power capacity of new plant  construction is up to 33,720MW, 8,000MW of which is now in  operation.    Foreign loans have not only accelerated electric power  construction in China, but they have raised the level of  construction and operational management and the economic  performance of the electric power industry. The World Bank,  which partly funded the construction of the Yunnan Lubuge  hydropower station, was the first project partner brought into  China, and the Chinese power construction units, having survived  that very painful resurrection, promptly went on to build the  pumped-storage hydropower station in Guangzhou at a pace of  construction that is without rival. The power plants being built  with foreign loans and imported facilities have been ushering in  a parade of safe, economic, and sophisticated units that have  enabled the Chinese electric power industry to realize an annual  average reduction in consumption of 3 grams of standard coal per  kWh for several years running.    In addressing the future development of China's electric  power industry, Zhao Xizheng said that the only way out of the  money shortage that is inhibiting the large-scale development of  the power industry is to find more ways to raise funds. To do  this, the Ministry of Electric Power will continue to encourage  foreign investments in China through independent ventures,  joint-ventures, cooperative endeavors, or any other means to get  electric power, and it will support local governments and  electric power enterprises in securing more foreign investment.  New forms of finance, such as alliance funding, and common  international forms like BOT and BOOT will also be encouraged,  and other new ways to secure loans must be found. In a word,  there will have to be some breakthroughs in the use of foreign  loans.</p>

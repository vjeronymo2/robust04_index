			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCAA BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE UNDERDOG;  </P> <P> REBELS: BUT NEVADA LAS VEGAS AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN A FAVORITE OVER GEORGIA  TECH IS A TOUGH SELL.  </P> <P> Nevada Las Vegas attempted Friday to alter the perception among fans and media  that the Runnin' Rebels are prohibitive favorites to beat Georgia Tech today in  the semifinals of the NCAA basketball tournament.  </P> <P> Georgia Tech, of course, tried to perpetuate that perception.  </P> <P> Everyone, it seems, prefers the role of the underdog.  </P> <P> In the Yellow Jackets' case, it seems to fit.  </P> <P> If Georgia Tech is "Lethal Weapon 3," the nickname given its high-scoring  triumvirate of forward Dennis Scott and guards Kenny Anderson and Brian Oliver,  perhaps UNLV should be called the Slaughterhouse Five.  </P> <P> "UNLV is scary," Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Cremins said. "They have great  talent. They've been here before, and they want this one badly. That's not to  say we don't, but we've really got to put together a great game.  </P> <P> "We are capable of playing very exciting basketball at times. But throughout  the tournament, we've been up and down, and, of course, we've been very  fortunate in a couple of the games."  </P> <P> If not for a disputed last-second shot by Anderson, which television replays  seemed to indicate was released after the buzzer had sounded, Georgia Tech  would have lost to Michigan State in the Southeast Regional semifinals instead  of beating the top-seeded Spartans in overtime.  </P> <P> It's no wonder that Anderson said Friday at a news conference: "We just play  hard until the sound of the buzzer ends."  </P> <P> The Yellow Jackets (28-6) tied for third place in the Atlantic Coast  Conference, but they won the ACC tournament at Charlotte, N.C., and they have  yet to lose a game by more than five points. Four defeats were by two points,  and they lost another game by one.  </P> <P> For scoring, they rely almost exclusively on Scott, Anderson and Oliver, who  among them average almost 70 points a game.  </P> <P> Anderson, a freshman point guard from New York who is averaging 20.7 points,  8.1 assists and 5.4 rebounds, kidded Cremins this week, telling his coach: "I  told you I was going to get you to the Final Four."  </P> <P> Said Cremins: "I laughed and said, 'You know as well as I do that we had no  idea that we would be here.' "  </P> <P> But the coach added: "This team really came together. Something special  happened. What's great about it is, it's so unexpected. I don't have the  answers. We just came together at the right time.  </P> <P> "Kenny blossomed. He's been more of an impact player than I thought he was  going to be. Dennis Scott -- I had no idea he was going to play like this (and  average 27 points a game). And everybody just got happy. Everybody liked each  other. And we liked winning. I just sat back and enjoyed it."  </P> <P> At Las Vegas, Coach Jerry Tarkanian had no such luxury.  </P> <P> UNLV's season was fraught with academic problems, suspensions, fights, arrests  and yet another NCAA investigation, still ongoing. Despite all that, the  Rebels, No. 1 in most of the preseason polls, played well enough to wind up No.  2 at the regular season's end.  </P> <P> Two of their tournament victories have been 30-point blowouts.  </P> <P> "I told the kids all year, 'If we keep our heads together and we keep working  hard, we have a chance to do something big,' " Tarkanian said.  </P> <P> All five UNLV starters boast double-figure scoring averages. The Rebels are  33-5, and reached the Final Four for the second time in four years by beating  Loyola Marymount, 131-101, in the West Regional final.  </P> <P> UNLV uses a pressure man-to-man defense to disrupt its opponents, but, alluding  to Anderson, who is not easily rattled, Tarkanian said: "We have a lot more fun  playing against guards who don't handle the ball well."  </P> <P> UNLV is more talented in the front court than Georgia Tech. All-American  forward Larry Johnson is averaging 20.7 points and 11.6 rebounds, and the other  forward, Olympian Stacey Augmon, is averaging 14.1 points and seven rebounds  and made his reputation as one of the nation's most tenacious defenders. Center  David Butler is averaging 16.2 points and 7.5 rebounds.  </P> <P> Georgia Tech's strength is its perimeter game, but UNLV guards Anderson Hunt  and Greg Anthony are averaging almost 30 points a game between them.  </P> <P> UNLV is probably better, but that's no guarantee of a victory.  </P> <P> "I disagree with (being labeled) overwhelming favorites," Tarkanian said. "If  it was a seven-game series, the best team would probably win, but in a one-game  situation, whoever has the best game, gets the right bounce of the ball or gets  the key call from an official can win it.  </P> <P> "It's going to come down to that."  </P> <P> If it does, that would be all right with Georgia Tech.  </P></p>

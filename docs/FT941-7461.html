			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Mercedes saves DM1bn through supplier projects Mercedes-Benz has attributed savings of DM1bn (Dollars 588m) to a new 'partnership' with its suppliers. At the company's factory at Sindelfingen near Stuttgart, Mr Manfred Remmel, a director, said costs of certain supplies had dropped by up to 40 per cent since Mercedes sought to forge a new relationship with its suppliers. Mercedes, through its so-called Tandem programme, has hammered out 300 projects with suppliers to reduce costs, develop products and improve quality, Mr Remmel explained. He drew an unspoken parallel with the aggressive cost-cutting 'hit-squads' operated by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, purchasing director at Volkswagen. These have been the focus of criticism within the German car components industry. 'Our co-operation lives from dialogue, not diktat,' the Mercedes executive said. However, he made clear the achievements of the past year were not enough to eliminate the German automotive industry's cost disadvantages against foreign, especially Japanese, manufacturers. When the cost-reduction process began last year, the Japanese enjoyed a 30 per cent cost advantage. The gap had narrowed, but manufacturers and suppliers had to continue their efforts to become more efficient, Mr Remmel said. The drive to cut the costs of supplies was part of Mercedes' broader cost-cutting strategy. Mr Helmut Werner, Mercedes chief executive, explained recently that a combination of measures - chiefly staff reduction - had reduced costs by DM4bn last year. The aim is to close the gap with Japanese suppliers by 1998, he said. Last month he said to reduce further the cost of supplies - which amounted to DM19bn last year at the company's 13 production sites in Germany - the company could buy a higher percentage of components from foreign suppliers. German components suppliers have been under intense pressure. Mr Konrad Ellegast, deputy chairman of Phoenix, one of the companies involved in the Tandem project, said yesterday very few companies in the sector made a profit last year. Bankruptcies in the sector would continue this year.</p>

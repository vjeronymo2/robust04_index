			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: SHIFTING GERE  </P> <P> Richard Gere's latest turn is as a truly nasty cop in "Internal Affairs." And  he'll be seen, come March, in director Garry Marshall's "Pretty Woman," as a  wealthy New York businessman who attempts a Pygmalion-like transformation of an  L.A. woman of the streets.  </P> <P> But the role he would really like to play is a far cry from either.  </P> <P> "There hasn't been a movie made in English about the Buddha," says the actor  who is a devotee of Buddhism. "This is amazing, for he's one of the two most  widely revered religious leaders ever. I've discussed the possibility of a film  about the Buddha with the Dalai Lama (Tibet's exiled spiritual leader)."  </P> <P> Gere says that Christopher Isherwood wrote a script for such a film before his  death in 1986, adding, "I'm scouting around to find out if there is sufficient  interest, financially speaking. . . . 'Gandhi' proved that Westerners are  interested in world figures from other cultures who have eternal messages to  give us, messages urgently needed today."  </P> <P> And who might play Buddha?  </P> <P> "I'm the right age," Gere says. "He began his ministry at about 30 and lived to  be about 80. Besides, the Buddha (born Siddhartha Gautama, an Indian prince)  was Caucasian. Everyone thinks, from the statues, that he was Oriental, but he  wasn't." Boze Hadleigh  </P></p>

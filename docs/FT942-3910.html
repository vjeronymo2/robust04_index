			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Both sides upbeat in BBC dispute Both sides in the industrial dispute at the BBC yesterday appeared optimistic that talks today at Acas, the conciliation service, could lead to a settlement of the action which has already halted programmes for two 24-hour periods, Diane Summers writes. Bectu, the main technical union, and the NUJ journalists' union called off action planned for yesterday and dropped plans for a stoppage tomorrow. The dispute is about the implementation of performance pay and the decentralisation to individual BBC directorates of negotiations on some terms of employment. BBC management said it hoped that once certain reassurances and clarifications had been given at Acas the unions would 'feel free to put the matter to a ballot of their members with a recommendation to accept' the package. The corporation emphasised that it was 'not in a position to move any further' on the substance of the offer.</p>

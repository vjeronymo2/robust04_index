			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Codelco divisions to have more autonomy Codelco, Chile's state copper company, is to change its management structure to allow its six divisions more autonomy. The new structure will come into effect on March 11 when Mr Juan Villarzu takes over as head of Codelco under the new administration of president-elect Eduardo Frei. Mr Villarzu has scrapped the post of vice-president for operations, an intermediary between the Santiago-based headquarters and the managers of the mining, power and workshop divisions. 'The transformation of Codelco into one of the most profitable large mining concerns in the world requires rapid and effective decentralisation,' Mr Villarzu said. He proposed the scrapping of the operations vice-presidency and the 'immediate creation of an administration council in each of the divisions, with the consequent strengthening of decision-making at that level'. Pressure to streamline Codelco's structure has grown enormously since last month's metal futures fiasco, in which one Codelco trader is alleged to have lost the company Dollars 206m. Critics of Codelco argue that its unwieldy structure and 'giganticism' were partly responsible for the lack of control over futures operations. Even before the scandal, Mr Villarzu had emphasised the need to 'modernise' Codelco through the creation of autonomous divisions. Each unit, including some of the break-even mines, may eventually be required to operate at a profit. Many of Codelco's top executives resigned after the futures trading scandal, giving Mr Villarzu free hand to bring in an entirely new team.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Black Sea Fleet Commander Admiral Eduard Baltin's  remark -- that he refused to enrol Sevastopol Naval Institute  graduates in the fleet because of the poor quality of their  training -- has not gone unremarked by the press center of the  Ukrainian Navy. The press center's statement in this connection  stresses that the level of knowledge, demonstrated by the first  group of the institute's officer graduates in the course of  working for their diplomas, was high. Three of them were  awarded both lieutenants' shoulder straps and golden medals, and  another 29 received higher educational institution graduation  diplomas with honors.    Vice Admiral Mykola Klitnyy, state commission chairman and  ex-chief of staff of the Black Sea Fleet, said that the quality  of education at the institute has traditionally been high. In  the two years that have passed since the reorganization of naval  schools into the institute, the skills and professional  knowledge of the professors and lecturers have not been lost.    It is hard to add anything to Klitnyy's words. It is only  possible to point out that the institute's Ukrainian status  causes Black Sea Fleet officials to react in certain way, the  press center's statement says. It is planned, incidentally,  that 57 of the institute's graduates will serve in the Russian  Navy.</p>

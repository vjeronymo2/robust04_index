			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA;  </P> <P> REDEVELOPMENT ZONE TO GET HEARING  </P> <P> The Santa Paula City Council will hold a public hearing next week on a proposed  1,100-acre redevelopment zone, which would encompass the southern third of the  city.  </P> <P> If the council approves the district Monday, sidewalks, streets and traffic  signals would be upgraded, archaic sewer systems would be replaced and  handicapped facilities such as sidewalk ramps would be installed, City  Councilman Carl Barringer said.  </P> <P> The area includes the Santa Paula Airport and some older homes, and is largely  industrial and commercial.  </P> <P> The creation of a redevelopment agency causes property tax revenues in the zone  to be frozen for such agencies as the county and school districts that share  the funds. These agencies no longer automatically benefit from any increase in  property values. Instead, that increment is given to the redevelopment agency.  </P> <P> The 2% yearly increase in property taxes guaranteed by Prop. 13 would account  for much of the $250 million in improvements that the city would like to make.  In addition, taxes generated when houses are built, sold or remodeled would go  to the redevelopment agency.  </P> <P> Negotiators for the city and the agencies that receive the tax revenues have  proposed an agreement that would give the agencies a larger percentage of the  property tax revenue than they would otherwise receive. For instance, the  county would get 30% of the 2% increase allowed annually under Prop. 13.  </P> <P> Santa Paula is one of the last cities in Ventura County to establish a  redevelopment agency. Camarillo is the only city in the county without a  redevelopment agency, said Santa Paula Councilman Les Maland. AMELIA CHAFFEE  </P></p>

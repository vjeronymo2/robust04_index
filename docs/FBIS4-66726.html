			<p>CSO     [Text] Hashemi-Rafsanjani, president of the Islamic  Republic, who has recently (the last time was in his New Year's  message to Iranians inside the country) been describing the  economic situation as bright and rosy, in his Friday prayer  sermon of 26 Farvardin (15 April) spoke of "strange injustices"  and "the lack of health in the nation's economy." He said this  abnormal situation is the result of the subsidies the government  is paying to meet society's consumer needs.    Rafsanjani said: Overall, the government is paying 600  billion tumans, or in other words, one-fifth of the total  general budget, as subsidies. In this figure, revenues from oil  sales that could have been obtained at the OPEC price ($13 per  barrel) but were not, were not included. Rafsanjani noted that  in Iran 1.4 million barrels of oil and 800,000 barrels of gasoil  is consumed daily and provided to the consumer at the cost of  production. He said: "We have no revenue from it" and that the  money collected is only enough to meet the costs of refining,  shipping, and distribution.    Rafsanjani divided government subsidies into the "unjust"  and  "just" categories and said: The classes with high incomes use  some subsidies in the same way that the low-income classes use  them, and this is not "just."    In the midst of this, the newspapers supporting continued  subsidies write that since 80 percent of the people of Iran are  living below the poverty line, 16 percent of the budget is being  spent "in the right direction," and only 4 percent of it reaches  the wealthy in the form of subsidies.    In any case, the elimination of subsidies will mean that a  new wave of high prices will engulf Iran's society.    Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: While in France the government has  an annual income of $40 billion from energy, the Islamic  Republic of Iran sells oil products to consumers at the cost of  production, and it derives no revenue from it.    Rafsanjani said: Not counting the price of oil, every year  600 billion tumans is spent on subsidies, and this is one-fifth  of the nation's total budget. The president of the Islamic  Republic said: Most of the subsidies are spent on basic goods  such as wheat, sugar, vegetable shortening, rice, and meat. This  comes to 300 billion tumans and is half the government's total  subsidies.    He said these kinds of subsidies are a kind of "oppression"  to the nation because of the fact that they are used the same  way by both rich and poor.    "Unfortunately," he said, "we perpetrate this oppression  that  spends the public's money for people who do not need it."    While enumerating the subsidized items, Rafsanjani said: The  government pays 40 billion tumans to the Imam's Aid Committee,  40 billion tumans to the Martyr Foundation, 5.5 billion tumans  to insurance for "vulnerable" classes, and 1.5 billion tumans to  help former prisoners of war. He said this help is of the "just"  type.    He said the subsidies for bread and fuel are among the  "unjust" ones, because both rich and poor use them the same way.    Rafsanjani gives 21 billion tumans in aid for the  government's pilgrimage trip, but he said nothing about whether  that is just or not. The pilgrimage, according to the scripture,  is incumbent upon those who are "able" to make it.    On the other hand the Tehran media, which is opposed to  eliminating the subsidies, wrote in criticism of what Rafsanjani  said that in view of the fact that 80 percent of the people are  below the poverty line, 16 percent of the subsidies reach the  needy classes. The same newspaper writes, based on the president  of the republic's analysis, in the new year one must expect  higher prices and more pressure on the people (the same 80  percent) without anything being done to counteract this  pressure. They conclude: "Of course if the elimination of  subsidies leads to job creation and production, it is possible  the people will welcome it."    However, economic experts do not consider the creation of  jobs and incomes for the vulnerable classes to be that likely in  today's Iran.</p>

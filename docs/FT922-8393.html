			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / TUC moves to avert row over recruitment LEADERS of the Trades Union Congress were yesterday trying to avert a fresh row over inter-union recruitment which could jeopardise the admission of the electrical section of the newly formed Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union to the TUC. Mr Norman Willis, general secretary of the TUC, yesterday wrote to all unions involved saying that the AEEU had agreed not to go ahead with a merger between its electrical section and Cabin Crew '89 while TUC-led discussions were continuing. Cabin Crew '89 is a 5,000-strong union of airline cabin-crew staff which broke away from the TGWU general union. The TUC hopes that the engineering section of the AEEU will veto any move by the electrical section, formerly the EETPU, to take Cabin Crew '89, or any other disaffected union splinter groups, into membership. Both sections of the AEEU are voting on TUC membership next year. Mr Paul Gallagher, general secretary of the electricians' section, responded to a sharply worded statement from Mr Bill Morris, general saecretary of the TGWU, by saying they would not allow other unions to run their affairs. Mr Morris had warned the TUC that unless it took firm action to stop the merger the TGWU would have to consider its own future in the TUC.</p>

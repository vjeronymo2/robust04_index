			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Ukraine plans sell-off vouchers UKRAINE yesterday said it would introduce a voucher scheme next week to allow all Ukrainian citizens to take part in a planned privatisation programme. Mr Valentyn Symonenko, minister of the economy, said that by September 5 every Ukrainian would be allotted 30,000 roubles to be held in special bank accounts and valid only for the purchase of state property. The government plans to gradually sell state property, beginning later in the autumn. Although the mechanism is similar to a plan unveiled in Moscow last month, Mr Symonenko said there were fundamental differences between Kiev's and Moscow's economic strategies. 'Immediate transfer to the market economy is unrealistic, as the Russian experience demonstrates,' he said. Mr Symonenko, a former Communist party boss from Odessa who was recently granted the authority to rule the economy by decree, also sought to smooth over differences between Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund which last month warned that unless Ukraine began to implement its paper reforms it would not receive a credit package. 'There are no global differences between what we are doing and what the IMF is suggesting,' Mr Symonenko said. He is due to present an economic reform package to parliament on September 16. Mr Symonenko said his plan would focus on rationalising the huge state enterprises, which in his view could not be quickly privatised but in the current climate of administrative chaos were running amok. Mr Symonenko also cautioned against too hasty an introduction of the hryvnia, Ukraine's long-awaited separate currency, warning that if the new currency was introduced before the economy is stabilised, 'it will just be paper'. Russia has agreed to pay Belarus's portion of the former Soviet Union's foreign debt in return for its neighbour's share of former Soviet assets, Itar-Tass news agency said yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow. It said Moscow had agreed to pay Belarus's share of Dollars 3.5bn out of the total outstanding foreign debt of around Dollars 70bn. In return, Russia will receive assets including part of the Belarussian entitlement to former Soviet property abroad, under an agreement published by the Belarussian government.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (13): A leader in global TV news - Aggressive expansion by CNN television network Along with the movie Gone with the Wind, Martin Luther King and its baseball team the Braves, Atlanta is probably best known throughout the US as home to CNN, the all-news cable television network which sprung to national - and international - prominence several years ago with its coverage of the Gulf War. Yet, the benefits CNN bring to the city go beyond the kudos of national name-recognition. The network, which is part of the giant entertainment group Turner Broadcasting System owned by Mr Ted Turner, is also a leading employer in the metropolitan area as well as a considerable tourist attraction. The CNN Centre in downtown Atlanta is visited daily by many hundreds, eager to see at first-hand the production of CNN's television programming. The network has come a long way from the early 1980s, when it was widely derided as 'Chicken Noodle News.' The brainchild of Mr Turner, who foresaw a demand for 24-hour television news long before anyone else, CNN is regarded as an important news source for a hardcore audience of US viewers, and as essential viewing in times of national and international crisis by many more. However, CNN's ratings have never been that large - it typically attracts about 400,000 viewers in the US - and recently its ratings have begun to slide. In the first quarter of this year, CNN's ratings in the US were down 25 per cent on the same period of 1993, and in the first six months of this year lower ratings contributed to flat advertising revenues. Without continued growth in CNN International, the network's non-US operation, CNN would have reported a decline in revenues for the first half of 1993. Yet, some of the decline in ratings cannot be blamed on CNN itself - like any news service, it needs big news events to keep viewers tuned in, and during the first half of 1994 a lack of big news, combined with improving competition from local newscasts and specialist news magazines, took their toll. (Although the double-murder story involving sports star OJ Simpson was huge news in the US, CNN faced stiff competition from local news purveyors and specialist channels such as Court TV). The recent weakness in domestic ratings, however, cannot obscure the fact that CNN remains a handsomely profitable business for its parent TBS. Last year, it generated an operating profit of Dollars 231m on revenues of almost Dollars 600m. Moreover, CNN's ratings have always moved with the news cycle, and the third quarter of 1994 produced two big stories with a strong US and international dimension - the crisis in Haiti and the threat of another invasion of Kuwait by Iraq - could pay off in the form of higher viewership for the second half of this year. Furthermore, the maturing of its domestic market need not be so worrying as long as CNN continues to build revenues from its international operation. After years of losing money, CNNI is now in profit and the fastest-growing arm of CNN. Its revenues last year totalled about Dollars 100m, and this year CCNI is expected to earn between Dollars 50m and Dollars 60m on revenues of Dollars 113m. That is a considerable improvement from four years ago, when CNNI lost a little over Dollars 3m on revenues of just Dollars 13.6m. This growth has come from aggressive expansion into new markets in three main regions - Latin America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. It has been accomplished mostly by adding new satellites that carry larger 'footprints' which enable CNNI's programmes to be broadcast on a more powerful signal to homes in a much wider geographic area. As a consequence, as of this summer, CNNI was transmitting to an estimated 80m television households in more than 210 countries via a network of 12 satellites. To improve CNNI's news programming, CNN has built a new Dollars 11m production centre in Atlanta to complement its existing European regional centre in London, and it will soon open a new Asian regional centre in Hong Kong. Each centre will produce a version of CNNI programming geared toward its region's viewers. In South America, CNN has no English-language competition, but faces a threat from several Spanish-language networks run by Reuters, the Mexican television group Televisa, and the US network NBC. CNNI competes indirectly with them through the four half-hour segments of Spanish-language news it broadcasts every day, but clearly could lose ground to the native-language news services because the number of fluent English-speakers in the region is so small. In Europe, CNNI's largest market, the principal competition comes from Mr Rupert Murdoch's Sky News channel. Although Sky is very UK-oriented, Mr Peter Vesey, head of CNNI, admits: 'On some stories with a particular European interest, they can be very competitive with us in serving their UK-based audience.' Another competitor is Euronews, which was set up by a political mandate from the European Community and broadcasts news in five different languages - 'it's a wonderful technical achievement,' says Mr Vesey, 'but it's not, from what I hear, a very watchable product.' CNN could also face competition soon from the BBC, which has talked of moving into the European market on a subscription basis with a version of World Service TV. CNN also competes indirectly with the BBC in the Asia-Pacific region, as it does with Star TV satellite system, which is the largest in Asia and which may eventually be part of a global sattelite news service alongside Mr Murdoch's Fox Television in the US and Sky News in Europe. Mr Vesey says of CNNI's global competition: 'As you can see, the field is kind of crowded.' In future, however, CNNI may be competing more with native-language broadcasters, although here the network has tried to hedge its bets through its occasional Spanish-language broadcasts and a joint venture with German broadcasters in Germany called n-tv. Mr Vesey says: 'We will see more regional competition, but I don't think it will be English-language competition. If I was to spend a ton of money on bringing you Asia every day, I would probably choose to do it in Chinese, or maybe Japanese. That is one of the biggest dilemmas we have classically faced. English is the best language to be in - on a worldwide basis - but you're really limiting yourself in terms of a mass audience, and there's no way around that. The way to extend and expand beyond that is to go the n-tv route in Europe. If you're going to take it into the region and tell people about things that are most important to them, you've got to make the decision to do it in their language.' The CNNI chief, however, is confident that its head start of 15-years experience in global news production should allow it to stay ahead of the international field.</p>

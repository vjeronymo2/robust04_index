			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CHANNEL ISLANDS;  </P> <P> SANCTUARY'S ROLE IN ECONOMY STUDIED  </P> <P> A fellowship recipient has begun a federally funded study to determine how much  the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary contributes to the local economy  through fishing, boating and other commercial activities.  </P> <P> The yearlong project will also recommend ways the sanctuary can increase its  contribution through heavier uses that do not harm its environment.  </P> <P> The project is supervised by Julie A. Reynolds, who received a California Sea  Grant fellowship. The sea grant program is funded through the National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration, which governs the sanctuary.  </P> <P> The aim of the study is to show that a national marine sanctuary can be managed  in a way that protects the environment while contributing to the local economy.  Information gained in the study will be applied to seven other national marine  sanctuaries.  </P> <P> The sanctuary, designated in 1980, includes 1,252 square miles of water  surrounding Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, San Miguel and Santa Barbara  islands.

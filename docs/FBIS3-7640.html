			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kim Chin-ha from UN Headquarters in New York] </F>   [Text] On 30 March North Korea proposed resuming dialogue  with the United States to resolve the present deadlocked nuclear  issue. A spokesman from the North Korean mission to the United  Nations said in a statement that North Korea wants to resolve  the nuclear issue by dialogue, not by armed forces. In  particular, it expects the issue to be settled within the  framework of proposals made by President Clinton in his news  conference on 24 March.    In his news conference held last week, President Clinton  said  that the United States wants to maintain normal relations with  North Korea and that if North Korea abides by the international  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, its future will be brighter.    Quoting remarks by a North Korean diplomat, THE NEW YORK  TIMES also reported today that unofficial working-level contacts  between the United States and North Korea are presently being  held at the United Nations, and that an official channel has  also been opened between the United States and North Korea.    The paper reported, however, that a U.S. envoy to the United  Nations and a spokesman for the U.S. State Department had  strongly denied the rumors regarding the U.S.-North Korean  contacts.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Irony behind unfairness of capital gains plans Sir, You are right to criticise the government's budget proposal to abolish indexation in calculating losses for capital gains tax (Leading article: 'Trickery with capital gains', December 13). The revenue yield will be very small, but that is not the point. Both the proposal to tax 'unreal' net capital gains and its retrospective aspect are unfair to taxpayers. This is the sort of thing that brings government into disrepute. It is ironic that the main supposed justification for taxing capital gains in the first place was to 'add fairness' to the tax system. You say it 'may be difficult to retreat from the principle of partial de-indexation'. On the contrary, it should be easy - as well as highly desirable - to retreat from a swindle.

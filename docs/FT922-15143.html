			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / A bumpy ride on a firmer track: The outlook for rolling-stock maker Brel THE 6,500 workers at Brel, the largest UK railway rolling-stock maker, may be relieved that the troubled company is coming under the majority control of Asea Brown Boveri - but they may be in for a bumpy ride. By purchasing the 40 per cent stake in Brel held by Trafalgar House, the Swiss-Swedish company ABB has at least resolved part of the uncertainty over Brel. Ownership of Brel now looks secure, with Europe's largest electrical engineering group holding 80 per cent and managers and employees sharing the rest. But Brel now faces the prospect of becoming a much more integrated part of ABB, and that is where the question marks remain. The deal might open the way for Brel to benefit from closer co-operation with ABB and share in work on overseas orders. Even so, Mr Bo Sodersten, installed as chief executive by ABB and Trafalgar House six months ago to revamp Brel's badly-organised management structure, stresses this will depend on Brel's continuing efforts to improve competitiveness. At the same time, though, the share purchase brings Brel closer to a big ABB division, transport, which is not exactly the star in the multinational's firmament. In Stockholm last month Mr Percy Barnevik, ABB's hard-driving president, made clear that he remained dissatisfied with the profitability of a division with 12,000 employees, excellent technology and rising orders, but also profits that were low in 1990 and lower still last year. ABB's transport business, like most of the rest of Europe's rail equipment sector, is struggling to emerge from its fragmented, inefficient and nationally-based past into a pan-European market where the old cosy 'cost-plus' relationships between suppliers and railway companies are loosening. ABB has been a key factor in the resultant restructuring, with nine acquisitions across Europe since 1988. This helped boost its transportation revenues from Dollars 1.31bn (Pounds 743m) in 1990 to Dollars 1.9bn last year, but profits remain depressed. Mr Barnevik says, however, the mid and long-term external outlook is bright, with the 'comeback' of railways in Europe and Asian expansion plans offering tempting prospects for well-organised European suppliers. Brel's future could benefit from the expected world growth in rolling-stock sales. Mr Sodersten says it will be 'much easier to find really good areas of co-operation now that ABB has 80 per cent of the company'. Brel has a solid repair and overhaul business at Crewe, where Mr Sodersten has had little need to wield the hatchet. Its problem has mainly been that of management, and particularly in its new construction business at York and Derby. Mr Richard Hope, consultant editor of Railway Gazette International, says: 'That's what brought them to grief. They have not been organised in getting their components suppliers and subcontractors lined up.' Mr Sodersten has had to reorganise management of the new construction division, and across Brel as a whole 1,000 jobs have gone since he took charge. He is pleased with what has been achieved, but admits more needs to be done. While the restructuring under Mr Sodersten continues, the short-term key to Brel's survival, let alone prosperity, is work from the UK. That is why observers believe this week's settlement of an acrimonious dispute with British Rail over the cost of modifications to 447 class-158 coaches is significant. While not directly linked, it looks like smoothing the path for the award by BR in the next few days of a Pounds 130m order for 188 coaches for Network SouthEast. Capturing such orders, and sharing in ABB's transportation growth, will be crucial in deciding any further job cuts at Brel.</p>

Our Kanpur correspondent, Raghunandan  Chaturvedi, quoting official sources, says 22 companies of  paramilitary and police are keeping a watch in sensitive areas.  In the (Babupurva) locality, the curfew has been relaxed for  three hours for the first time today in (Dankapurva), except in  blocks and transport mega pockets. The situation continued to  be peaceful during curfew relaxation. The state government has  constituted a one-man commission to go into the incidents in  Varanasi during the first week of this month.    Meanwhile, Banaras Hindu University administration has  ordered an inquiry into the death of a student in the university  hospital last Sunday [13 February] and the incidents of violence  which followed his death. A retired judge of the Allahabad High  Court will conduct the inquiry. The bundh [strike] called by  the Students Union in Varanasi against the indefinite closure of  the Banaras Hindu University has had a mixed response today.  Police arrested over 50 persons, including the Students Union  leader, for defying prohibitory orders under Section 144.</p>

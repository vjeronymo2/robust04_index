			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Sterling cornered For those of a lurid turn of mind, yesterday's further 2-pfennig slide in sterling points to a shoot-out between the UK government and the foreign exchange market. Messrs Major and Lamont continue to assert, in as many ways as they know how, that their commitment to the ERM is absolute. The market, half expecting a rise in German rates this week and only half believing that the UK has the stomach to follow suit, continues to challenge that commitment. In fact, the odds are still against the issue coming to a head. If the Bundesbank settles for technical manoeuvres in the money markets, sterling may scrape by. After all, some form of German tightening is already in the price, and sterling is still 7 pfennigs clear of its absolute floor. Then again, in the unlikely event of German rates being formally raised by half a point or so, the UK would surely be obliged to follow. For in that case, UK short rates would be below Germany's. As Mr Lamont pointed out in a different context last Friday, that is a situation which obtained for just 16 weeks throughout the 1980s. But if the market thinks Messrs Major and Lamont would duck the necessity, it is surely wrong. By going as far as they have in their public pronouncements, both men have deliberately destroyed that option, if it ever existed. A rise in UK rates would do material damage to the real economy, particularly in respect of consumer confidence. But it would be beneficial in one single respect. Since the UK joined the ERM it has cut rates nine times. It has never raised them. For the markets, this creates an asymmetrical view of sterling wholly at odds with the other member currencies, for whom adjusting rates either way is a matter of pragmatic routine. It might almost be said that the UK has to raise rates to become a full member of the club and to stop being picked on. The timing would be fairly appalling, but so are the alternatives.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 24 (YONHAP) -- South Korea is poised to  inform the United States of its position that it is firmly  opposed to North Korea's proposal for replacing the Korean  armistice agreement with a peace treaty being discussed in  U.S.-North Korea talks, according to Deputy Prime Minister Yi  Hong-ku Monday.    Yi told the National Assembly Foreign Affairs and National  Unification Committee the government will convey such position  at Seoul-Washington working-level meetings to be held in the  U.S. capital soon in preparation for a third round of high-level  talks between the United States and North Korea.    Yi said, "substituting the armistice agreement with a peace  accord cannot be an issue to be discussed between the United  States and North Korea, and this point will be reiterated to the  U.S. Government by Nuclear Affairs Ambassador Kim Sam-hun, who  is currently visiting Washington."    Yi, also the national unification minister, made the remarks  while replying to lawmakers' questions on the possibility that  North Korea may demand a peace accord.    The South Korean Government has devised its policy based on  an analysis of North Korea's strategy in demanding a U.S. troop  withdrawal from Korea.    Government officials said the issue of a peace accord should  be addressed by the South and North Koreans in accordance with  the basic South-North agreement signed in 1992. Until that  time, the present armistice accord should be strictly observed,  they stressed.</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: Better-than-expected PSBR boosts long-dated gilts THE COMBINATION of better-than-expected borrowing figures and general enthusiasm over the inflation outlook helped to boost long-dated UK government bonds by three-quarters of a point yesterday. Short-dated gilts were little changed as the market's attention shifted from hopes of an imminent cut in the base rate to the good inflation background and yesterday's release of the July public sector borrowing requirement figure. The PSBR figure of Pounds 1.5bn was below market expectations of Pounds 1.8bn to Pounds 1.9bn, helped by proceeds from the sale of the third tranche of shares in British Telecommunications. Economists pointed out that the latest Confederation of British Industry survey, published yesterday, indicated economic recovery without the threat of a pick-up in inflation, a scenario which was warmly welcomed by the gilt market. The Liffe gilt futures contract opened at 113.01 and reached a high of 113.24 before slipping to 113.21 by late afternoon. With the rally concentrated on longer-dated stocks, the gilt yield curve flattened. FRENCH government bonds ended lower on the day, despite the Banque de France's half-point cut in the overnight rate to 8.75 per cent yesterday morning. While the franc strengthened on the news, the bond market sold off as both domestic and international investors took profits. Elsewhere in Europe, the German bond market closed higher on the day, more than making up for early weakness. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 97.15, and rose to a high of 97.37 before ending at around 97.35. MR JOHN Dawkins, the Australian Treasurer, forecast higher-than-expected inflation in his budget speech yesterday, which had a negative impact on government bonds. He said the consumer price index (CPI) was expected to rise by 3.5 per cent in the fiscal year 1993-94. The market had expected a CPI rise of between 2.5 per cent and 3.0 per cent. Bond prices fell on the news, with the yield on the 9.5 per cent bond due 2003 rising to 6.87 per cent, from 6.80 per cent just before the budget speech. The Australian government projected a budget deficit of ADollars 16bn for the year ending June 30 1994, widening from a revised deficit of ADollars 14.6bn in the 1992 - 93 fiscal year. JAPANESE bonds saw volatile trading, taking their cue from the yen, but ended little changed on the day. The yen strengthened to a post-war high of Y100.25 to the US dollar, before slipping back. The yield on the benchmark No 145 issue opened at 4.065 per cent and traded in a range of 4.03 to 4.11 per cent before ending at 4.07 per cent. In the futures market, the December contract reached a high of 111.22 and ended Tokyo trading little changed at 110.90, but slipped back in London to 110.72. AFTER early gains, longer-dated US Treasury prices fell back on disappointment that the Federal Reserve did not add reserves to the system. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/32 at 99 1/4 , yielding 6.304 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  1/16 at 100 15/32 , to yield 3.980 per cent. The market lacked a firm direction in morning trading, but longer-dated securities maintained their upward momentum. The gains sent yields on the 30-year bond to record lows. Traders said the strength was primarily due to buying in anticipation of a coupon pass by the Fed, which would involve the central bank buying Treasury coupons outright. In the afternoon long prices fell back when a coupon pass failed to materialise. The losses, however, were minimal, and trading remained light throughout the session.</p>

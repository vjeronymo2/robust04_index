			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Pak-Sino Defense Cooperation"] </F>   [Text] During the Pakistani defense minister's trip to  China, discussions were held on the proposed plan to build  Chinese MBD-2000 tanks in Pakistan. China and Pakistan are not  only neighboring nations, but also have extended trade,  cultural, and historical relations. China has helped Pakistan a  lot in its effort for economic development. Pakistan should be  especially proud about the dedication shown by Chinese engineers  in building the Silk Road. This highway has helped connect both  countries. Whenever there were bad times for Pakistan, China  always extended a helping hand. Since U. S. military and  economic aid to Pakistan has been stopped, Pakistan is looking  for an alternate source of help, and China has never shown any  hesitation in helping us. China is working on many plans with us  to make Pakistan's defense stronger and more stable. Among  these, the building of tanks tops the list. Despite U. S. anger  and unhappiness, Pakistan has made important progress in  building missiles with China's help. The HATF-1 and HATF-2 are  worth mentioning here. The United States is also very angry at  China for providing missile technology to Pakistan, and is  threatening China every other day. The friendship and  brotherhood of the Chinese are praiseworthy, because they were  not affected by these threats. With the help of Chinese  expertise and technical assistance, Pakistan can progress in  every area. Though the United States is blocking these efforts  at every occasion, Pakistan should keep the Chinese example in  front of it and not accept any foreign pressure. The way China  responded to the combined U. S. and former Soviet Union pressure  can be a guiding principle for Pakistan. Because of the close  relationship between Pakistan and China, a new series of  conspiracies is being hatched at the international level. On one  side, there are indications of new external interference in  Pakistan's northern region, and on the other, a solution to the  Kashmir problem is being worked out that would change Kashmir  into an independent country and a United States military base.  This way, the United States would use the base to carry out its  conspiracies against Pakistan and China. After the  disintegration of the former Soviet Union, the world's balance  of power has been destroyed, and a new rivalries and power  struggles have started. In order to protect ourselves from it,  it is important that a new power bloc composed of China,  Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan, and Central Asian Muslim  Republics be established. Pakistan can play an important role,  because of its geographic location, in bringing China and other  countries together. The government of Pakistan should take the  necessary steps immediately to realize this goal. Only this way  can we counter the challenge of the New World order.</p>

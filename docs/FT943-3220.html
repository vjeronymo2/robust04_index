			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Hitting target audience Direct marketing's ever-closer targeting of individuals is one of the reasons why junk mail is less of a problem in the eyes of UK consumers than it used to be: what might be junk to one person could be welcome correspondence to another. The industry's improving reputation is also down to the fact that it appears to be sticking, by and large, to a system of self-regulation, says the Advertising Standards Authority, the watchdog which monitors the sector. The rules, which came into force in 1992, require companies to make sure their information is accurate and up-to-date and consumers know why it is being collected. Says the ASA: 'If a company intends to pass on information to anyone else or use it for a significantly different purpose, consumers should be given an opportunity to opt out. If a company decides to use information it already has about someone it must gain permission first. Consumers should also be able to recognise the associations between companies within the same group.' Companies regularly have to comb their records for consumers who have stated, through the Mailing Preference Service, that they do not want to receive mailings. The rules, which build on the requirements of the Data Protection Act, also apply to press advertisements featuring response coupons. A recent ASA survey found that, out of a sample of 50 press advertisers, five intended to make their lists available to third parties and one failed to offer an opt-out to consumers. Three advertisers were passing on information to other companies within their group but were not making this sufficiently clear to consumers. Out of a sample of 50 direct mailers, seven were collecting information to rent out, but the opt-outs available to consumers were found to be reasonable. Rules on the Mailing Preference Service were being observed by both groups, found the ASA.</p>

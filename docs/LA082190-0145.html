			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> ZIGGY MARLEY BECOMING HIS OWN MON;  </P> <P> IT HASN'T BEEN EASY TO ESCAPE THE SHADOW OF THE ELDER BOB MARLEY, BUT ZIGGY AND  HIS BAND CAN STILL DO JUSTICE TO THEIR LEGACY WITH THEIR CONTEMPORARY VITALITY.  </P> <P> There seems something dishonest to seeing Ziggy Marley perform, though the  fault certainly isn't Marley's. Instead, as a listener, there is the uneasy  sensation that one is trying to cheat death.  </P> <P> Like John Lennon, the late Bob Marley was a visionary, unifying performer who  could have accomplished much more had his life not been cut short. But it also  couldn't be argued that the performers didn't do enough while they were alive.  </P> <P> Asked about a Beatles reunion, Lennon once unleashed his sarcasm, asking if we  really needed them to get up on that cross again -- weren't we paying attention  the first time?  </P> <P> Perhaps not, for both Ziggy Marley and Julian Lennon have been stuck by  listeners with the unenviable task of establishing their own art while cloaked  in their fathers' ghosts.  </P> <P> While the younger Lennon seems to have stumbled under that burden, Ziggy and  the Melody Makers' (featuring other Marley offspring Steve and Cedella Marley  and Sharon Pendergast) Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre show Sunday did justice to  their legacy while delivering their own music with a contemporary vitality.  </P> <P> While Ziggy's controlled stage presence couldn't be confused with the  commanding live-wire immediacy of his dad, he nevertheless offered a solid,  propulsive set drawn from 1988's "Conscious Party" and last year's "One Fine  Day" albums.  </P> <P> Lacking the demanding rough edges of the elder Marley, and buoyed by the  exuberant youth of the Melody Makers -- sisters Cedella and Sharon dance like  wildcats on a hot plate -- they have reached a larger U.S. audience than their  father ever did.  </P> <P> On most of their 14 songs a modern, energetic dance pulse was joined with  socially conscious lyrics. Those lyrics weren't always up to the weight of the  subject matter, as on "Black My Story (Not History)" which bit toothlessly at  the truncated European view of African history taught in schools. Even Marley's  resurrection of a Haile Selassie speech -- a staple of his father's  performances -- seemed stilted and flat.  </P> <P> But that was the exception amid the Marleys' uptown reggae grooves. Backed by a  tight seven-piece band, they upped the octane of the album versions of  "Tumblin' Down," "Look Who's Dancing," the unconditional "All Love" and the  1985 track "Reggae is Now."  </P> <P> The strongest of the original material was "Tomorrow People," which, with its  incantation of "If you don't know your past, don't know your future" took on a  particular resonance as performed to the largely young audience.  </P> <P> Marley delivered a charged version of the late Marley's "Get Up, Stand Up"  (with brother Steve handling Peter Tosh's mid-song rap) as well as a  goose-bump-inducing encore of the meditative "Redemption Song."  </P> <P> Opener Eek-a-Mouse has a unique, novel style of toasting (the Jamaican  precursor of rap), sounding like a cross between Porky Pig, a tobacco  auctioneer and a "Battlestar Galactica" Cylon warrior. But that wore mighty  thin over his hourlong set.  </P> <P> While it did get the crowd moving, his syllabic splatter, dead-simple reggae  riffs and stork-like stage moves undermined whatever import the lanky singer  might have intended for such numbers as "Terrorists in the City."  </P> <P> Brooklyn's Family Stand, however, could have easily filled more than the brief  35 minutes they were allotted. With their dance hit "Ghetto Heaven" as the  centerpiece of their five songs, the septet offered a strong set of Sly  Stone-derived soul and funk, resplendent with heavy bass lines, wah-wah guitars  and cat-meow vocals.  </P></p>

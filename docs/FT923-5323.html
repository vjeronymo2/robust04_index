			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Luxury car production suffers sharp decline PRODUCTION by loss-making specialist carmakers fell sharply in the first half of this year under the impact of the recession in the UK and in important foreign markets. Output by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, a subsidiary of Vickers, was 43 per cent lower than in the corresponding period a year ago at 618, while production by Jaguar, a subsidiary of Ford of the US, fell 25 per cent to 10,260. Group Lotus, a subsidiary of General Motors of the US, suffered a 68 per cent fall in output to 505 from 1,559 in the first half of last year. Aston Martin, the luxury sports carmaker which is 75 per cent owned by Ford, produced only 23 cars in the first half compared with 121 a year earlier. Jaguar, Aston Martin and Lotus have all announced further redundancies recently, while Lotus has been forced to abandon production of its main model, the loss-making Elan sports car. TVR, the privately-owned sports-car maker based in Blackpool, was the only specialist producer to buck the trend with a 9.1 per cent increase in production to 420. According to figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, overall car output in the first half of the year declined by 1.1 per cent to 686,747. Rover, a subsidiary of British Aerospace, was hardest hit among the volume carmakers with an 11 per cent fall in output to 203,822 (including production of the Honda Concerto, the Land Rover Discovery and Range Rover). Nissan provided the main boost to UK volume car output with an 18 per cent increase to 74,214. UK commercial vehicle output jumped by 25 per cent in the first half of the year to 138,925. Land Rover, the four-wheel drive vehicle division of Rover, is raising output of its Discovery range by 10 per cent from 500 to 550 a week in response to higher demand from the UK and overseas markets. The company said yesterday that in spite of weakening demand for new cars in Europe, sales of four-wheel drive leisure vehicles had remained strong. The Discovery, which was introduced in the UK in late 1989, has been helped by launches in Japan, Australia and the Middle East in the past 12 months.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        UK VEHICLE PRODUCTION  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                       1992        1991        1992/91                                     Jan-June    Jan-June     % Change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CARS Total                                 686,747     694,374         -1.1 Rover (British Aerospace)             203,822     229,086        -11.0  -  cars????                          185,154     208,141        -11.0  -  Range Rover/Discovery              18,668      20,945        -10.9 Ford (excl.

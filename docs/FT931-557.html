			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Britain and France seek end to fishing rights row BRITAIN and France yesterday moved to prevent a diplomatic row from developing over weekend incidents involving French fishermen and Royal Navy patrol vessels. The moves came as further confrontation between fishermen appeared to have been defused when 40 French boats left the Guernsey capital, St Peter Port. After discussions with the Guernsey Sea Fisheries Committee and Guernsey fishermen, French skippers agreed to a four-week cooling off period in which to try to resolve problems over disputed fishing grounds off the Channel island. Earlier, officials in both countries had called for calm. Mr David Curry, UK fisheries minister, played down earlier statements suggesting Britain might use force. The government would be 'hysterically over-reacting' if it changed its fisheries protection policy which precludes the use of firepower against unarmed fishermen, he said. 'I believe the French fishermen have been trying to take advantage of the transition between governments. They are trying it on. It is important not to confuse this with a more generalised EC dispute over fisheries,' Mr Curry said, following talks with Mr Archie Hamilton, UK defence minister. Mr Bernard Dorin, French ambassador in London, said a meeting with foreign office minister, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, was 'very cordial and friendly'. In a prepared statement, which had the apparent blessing of British officials, Mr Dorin said: 'The French government has condemned the fishermen's unacceptable behaviour in this matter . . . the French authorities will do everything necessary to ensure that such incidents are not repeated.' Meanwhile, Mr John Gummer, minister for agriculture and fisheries, repeated a warning that the UK would consider arming its naval boarding parties if French actions escalated. However, British officials stressed last night that they were dissuaded from altering the rules by the risk that this might exacerbate the relatively minor incidents when animosity between fishermen on both sides was high. On Sunday, three Royal Navy fisheries protection officers were abducted after boarding a French trawler off the Channel Islands. The events have come at a sensitive time for France, which is changing government following the electoral success of the conservative coalition. The outgoing Socialist government was supportive of French fishermen, who have been protesting against cheap fish imports, while at the same time condemning attacks by French fishing vessels. The RPR Gaullists, the largest conservative party, have been more chauvinistic than the outgoing Socialists at defending French interests, although UK officials are confident that they are unlikely to risk Anglo-French relations.

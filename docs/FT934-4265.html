			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / International Company News: Sweden to privatise state forest interests Sweden yesterday unveiled its biggest privatisation to date when it announced plans to raise between SKr5bn (Dollars 588m) and SKr8bn from the sale of a 49 per cent stake in a new grouping of state forestry interests. It also signalled it was aiming to sell off Pharmacia, the pharmaceuticals group which used to be part of Procordia, in May or June next year. This probably means that plans to privatise two other state-owned groups, Nordbanken and the electricity giant Vattenfall, will be deferred beyond next September's general election. The forestry company, which will be one of Europe's top 10 pulp and paper groups, has a market value of between SKr10bn and SKr16bn, according to Mr Per Westerberg, the Swedish industry minister. It will be privatised in the spring, once three existing forestry groups - Assi, Doman and Ncb - have been combined. Assi and Doman, both 100 per cent state-owned, are to combine at the year-end before making an all-share bid for Ncb, in which the state holds 51 per cent, in February or March. Most of the shares in the group are to be offered to the Swedish public. This follows heavy criticism of Sweden's last privatisation when the public offered to buy 80m shares in the defence group Celsius, more than 17 times the 4.6m shares allotted to them. The new group will have annual sales of SKr15bn making it nearly as big as MoDo, Sweden's third largest forestry company. It will be Sweden's largest forest owner and its biggest producer of sawn timber products. Pharmacia, the next privatisation candidate, is Sweden's second largest pharmaceuticals group after Astra. It is 46 per cent state-owned, after Volvo and the government, Procordia's main owners, agreed to divide the company last month.</p>

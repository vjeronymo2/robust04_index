			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Arts: Limited view of the US - William Packer takes issue over the choice of artists' work AMERICAN Art in the 20th Century is the latest in the Academy's ambitious series of survey exhibitions, in which the art of a longish lifetime is being examined, country by country. The modern art of Italy, Germany and Britain has already been treated, and now it is America's turn to come before the joint-selectors' eye. For yet again, as with the others, the view of the subject in both general and particular is that taken by Norman Rosenthal of the Royal Academy, and Christos Joachimides of the Zeitgeist-Gesellschaft at Berlin, where the exhibition has already been shown. Here, then, is no lack of controversy or entertainment. And critical substance? Well, up to a point, Lord Copper. The difficulty has been well rehearsed with their previous shows, but clearly must be set out again. Here is a show that advertises itself as 'a breathtaking survey' and again 'a monumental survey'. Epithets notwithstanding, it is no such thing. Some 60 artists in all are shown, which is not an enormous number, especially given the generous representation some of them enjoy. Furthermore, 19 of them, something over 30 per cent, are shown in the post-1970 section at the Saatchi Gallery. A mere 14 take us from 1913 to 1940. The period before 1913 is dismissed altogether as of no account. These are disproportionate figures, but only if the claim to being a true survey is taken seriously. Yet 'survey' it is, which can only invite expectations bound to be disappointed. What Rosenthal and Joachimides have given us is their own partial and opinionated selection of the work they consider relevant and significant within their brief. There is nothing wrong in that, no matter how wrong-headed and perverse they may be. They should only declare themselves in their true colours. As it is, there is nothing for it but to take issue with them. Did modern art in America really only begin in 1913 with the Armory Show in New York? In a limited sense perhaps it did, in first bringing the likes of Cezanne, Van Gogh and Picasso into general public view. But artists themselves, and indeed the more sophisticated American public, were surely better informed than that, and certainly no less well-travelled than their European counterparts. Are we to take it that in the disowning of the Whistlers, the Sargents and the Prendergasts of the 1900s, for being perhaps too Europeanised, we may read too the critical dismissal of impressionism and post-impressionism in their wider aspects? Certainly it would explain the marked absence of so many of the more figurative artists of the earlier period - no Sloan, Marsh, Bellowes, Bishop, Nadelman. Edward Hopper must stand for them all, which is a gross misrepresentation of a vigorous tradition. Ah] you might say: but what about the necessity of an essentially American subject matter, that at least is given here in the works of Georgia O'Keefe or Charles Sheeler, besides Hopper himself? But what could be more American than Reginald Marsh's burlesque theatres and strip-joints, or Isobel Bishop's railway stations, or George Bellowes's fighters? And what is so especially American about Man Ray, who spent so much time in Europe, or the Frenchman, Marcel Duchamp, with whom the exhibition begins? The whole point of American art, of course, is that it is hardly American at all. It is, rather, but one element in an international, interdependent picture, viewed only in a particular cultural and historical light. As much has been true of western art for centuries. It is the old story of immigrants, expatriates and stay-at-homes, and their coming to terms with the currency and inheritance - the baggage you might say - of European art. How fascinating it is to find Marsden Hartley, in such images as his pre-1914 German Officer, so early and assured in his response to Cubism; and how strong the proto-Pop paintings and assemblages of the 1920s, of Arthur Dove and John Covert, Charles Demuth and Stuart Davis, now appear, straight out of Dada and the early collages of Picasso. So it is with the next generation of artists, the founding fathers of abstract expressionism, whether newly-immigrant or native-born but united in their assimilation of the later surrealist, expressionist and abstracted examples of such artists as Picasso, Ernst, Miro, Kandinsky. Here the selection is at its strongest and most spectacular, with Arshile Gorky beautifully chosen and hung in the Academy's Room II, and the Banqueting Hall given to de Kooning, Pollock, Francis, Still and Kline. I would say here that whatever my feelings on the selection itself, the actual display, both at the Academy and at Saatchi, is admirably done. But the problems with the selection simply will not go way. With certain, favoured artists, such as Pollock or de Kooning, the choice is exemplary, shown in strength and offering something of the proper development of the work - and if there should be nothing of de Kooning after the mid 1960s, well, fair enough. But, again, immediately, we tread on a step that is not there. If Gorky and Pollock are followed through the 1940s, where is Rothko, whose work of that time is of the first importance as against the more familiar formulaic paintings of his last 20 years? And given Kline, where is Motherwell? Was Barnett Newman the only colour-field painter worth considering after 1960? Where is Morris Louis, where is Poons? Come to that, where are all the other later painters, Diebenkorn, Pearlstein, Rivers, Dine? Such lacunae are not so much inexcuseable as inexplicable, in a survey exhibition. Watch, as one might say, this space. I return to the matter on Tuesday. American Art in the 20th Century, 1913-1970 at the Royal Academy, Piccadilly W1/ 1970-1993 at the Saatchi Gallery, 98a Boundary Road NW8; until December 12: sponsored by Merrill Lynch, The Daily Telegraph and American Airlines</p>

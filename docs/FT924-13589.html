			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / International Company News: WestLB takes indirect stake in tour operator WESTDEUTSCHE Landesbank Girozentrale (WestLB), the Dusseldorf-based public sector bank, has made its second large purchase in the European travel sector. Together with LTU - Germany's largest airline charter group, in which WestLB has a large stake - the bank is taking an indirect holding in Touristik Union International (TUI), Europe's largest tour operator. WestLB and LTU recently took control of the Thomas Cook travel group. In a move which was greeted with hostility by the state government of Lower Saxony, where TUI is based, WestLB, LTU and Sudwestdeutsche LB, the Landesbank for Baden-Wurttemberg, are buying a majority stake in Walter Kahn Verwaltungs, a holding company which owns 30.2 per cent of TUI. The deal falls short of WestLB's original aim to buy the entire 30.2 per cent stake, but the bank and its associates are likely to increase their stake over time. No price was given, but the three companies are likely to have spent around DM150m (Dollars 102m), the bank having offered DM300m for the whole stake.</p>

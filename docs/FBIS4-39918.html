			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Kondratenko] </F>   [Text) St. Petersburg June 12 TASS -- Russian cosmonaut  Sergey Krikalev has mastered a new profession as he took  American astronauts, with whom he was in space together on board  the American Discovery spaceship, on a sightseeing tour around  the city as a guide.    Four out of the six-member crew of the Discovery spaceship  arrived in St. Petersburg, while the other two remained in  Moscow on business. Jane Davis said when visiting the St.  Petersburg mayor's office at midday on Sunday, that the  astronauts had often watched St. Petersburg from space, but  close acquaintance with the city was all the more pleasant. The  city is wonderful, the American guest said. Pilot Kenneth  Roitler expressed confidence that the U.S. and Russia would  continue joint experiments in space. Russian cosmonaut Sergey  Krikalev pointed out that difficulties Russia is going through  should not impede the development of national space research.  Both the Russian cosmonaut and his American colleagues  expressed readiness to make another space flight together.    On behalf of the space crew, a collection of photographs,  including snapshots of the start of the Discovery, the  astronauts on board and pictures of the astronauts, was  presented to the St. Petersburg mayor's office. The city Mayor  Anatoliy Sobschak was presented with a unique snapshot of the  city taken from space.    On June 14, the American astronauts will depart to the  United  States.</p>

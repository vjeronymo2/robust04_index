			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Yeo heads Conservative backers of energy bill The government could face a new rebellion by its own backbenchers early next year after five Tory MPs put their names to a controversial private member's bill to improve energy conservation. The MPs - who include Mr Tim Yeo, the former environment minister - yesterday emerged as co-sponsors of a bill which would force local authorities to improve energy conservation in residential properties. The legislation is being proposed by Mrs Diana Maddock, the Liberal Democrat MP for Christchurch, who came first in a ballot for private member's bills earlier this year. The bill is to receive its first debate - and second reading - in the Commons on January 20. The Department of Environment has not yet announced whether it will try to block the measure, but similar legislation - proposed by Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat MP for Berwick-upon Tweed - was opposed by government whips last year. Preliminary details of the bill were formally notified to the Commons clerks yesterday. Apart from Mr Yeo, the four Tory MPs sponsoring the measure are Mr Peter Bottomley, Sir Richard Body, Mr Peter Temple Morris, and Mr Gary Waller. The legislation would require local authorities to draw up energy conservation plans for their areas and promote the more efficient use of natural resources. However, Treasury officials may insist that the government should oppose the plans on the grounds that they will impose an unnecessary burden on public expenditure. Mr Yeo said last night that he had notified Mr Robert Jones, the environment minister, that he would be supporting the bill. He said: 'There was a bill in the last session which the government did resist. But our hope is that the modifications this time will stop it being obstructed.' The Green party said yesterday that it would closely watch the debate to see how the five Conservative sponsors voted. Mr David Taylor, the Green party's principal speaker, said: 'We will be scrutinising Hansard to ensure that those MPs that have promised constituents their support of this bill will not be ratting on their promises.'</p>

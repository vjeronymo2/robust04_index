			<p><!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Notwithstanding the foregoing, Southern states that no equity security having a stated par value would be issued or sold by a Project Parent for a consideration that is less than such par value. Southern also states that no note, bond or other evidence of indebtedness issued or sold by any Project Parent will mature later than 30 years from the date of issuance thereof, and will bear interest at a rate exceeding the following: (i) if such note, bond or other indebtedness is U.S. dollar denominated, at a fixed rate not to exceed 6.5% over the yield to maturity on an actively traded, non-callable, U.S. Treasury note having a maturity equal to the average life of such note, bond or other indebtedness (``Applicable Treasury Rate''), <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  or at a floating rate not to exceed 6.5% over the then applicable prime rate at a U.S. money center bank to be designated by Southern (``Applicable Prime Rate''); and (ii) if such note, bond or other indebtedness is denominated in the currency of a country other than the United States, at a fixed or floating rate which, when adjusted (i.e., reduced) for the prevailing rate of inflation in such country, as reported in official indices published by such country, would be equivalent to a rate on a U.S. dollar denominated borrowing of identical average life that does not exceed 10% over the Applicable Treasury Rate or Applicable Prime Rate, as the case may be.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> If there is no actively traded U.S. Treasury note with a maturity equal to the average life of such note, bond or other evidence of indebtedness, then the Applicable Treasury Rate would be determined by interpolating linearly with reference to the yields to maturity on actively traded, non-callable, Treasury notes having maturities near (i.e., both shorter and longer than) such average life.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In connection with the issuance of any non-recourse debt securities by any Project Parent, it is anticipated that such Project Parent may grant security in its assets. Such security interest may take the form of a pledge of the shares or other equity securities of an Exempt Subsidiary that it owns, including a security interest in any distributions from any such Exempt Subsidiary, or a collateral assignment of its rights under and interests in other property, including rights under contracts. It is also anticipated that fees in the form of placement or commitment fees, or other similar fees, would be paid to lenders, placement agents, or others in connection with the issuance of any such non-recourse debt securities. Southern requests authority for any Project Parent to agree in any case to pay placement or commitment fees, and other similar fees, in connection with any borrowing, provided that the effective annual interest charge on any indebtedness evidencing such borrowing is not greater than 115% of the stated interest rate thereon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In connection with investments in Exempt Subsidiaries, Southern states that it is typical that a portion of the capital requirements of any such Exempt Subsidiary would be obtained through non-recourse financing involving borrowings from banks and other financial institutions. Southern also states that, in some cases, however, it may be necessary or desirable to structure an investment in an Exempt Subsidiary such that the obligations created are not those of the Exempt Subsidiary, but instead those of its parent companies. For example, in a consortium of non-affiliated companies bidding to purchase the securities or assets of an EWG or FUCO, each of the consortium members would be obligated to fund its respective share of the proposed purchase price. If external sources of funds are needed for this purpose, a participant in the consortium may choose to engage in non-recourse financing through one or more single-purpose subsidiaries that would then utilize the proceeds of the financing to acquire an ownership interest in the Exempt Subsidiary. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Typically, the capital shares or other equity interests in the Exempt Subsidiary would be pledged to secure the securities issued by the Project Parent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jonathan G.

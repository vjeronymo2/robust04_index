			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Federation Council deputy Oleg Smolin: "Trap Is </F> Ready"]    [Text] There is no denying that everyone in Russia has  grown tired of political "talking shops." And the tanks firing  on the parliament building, Russian officers firing on Russian  deputies, are still before many people's eyes. Yearning for  civil peace and a normal, calm life in society is undoubtedly  growing. That is why April's main domestic political event was  the discussion of the "treaty on social accord" proposed in the  president's name.    From the formal legal viewpoint the draft clearly does not  stand up to criticism. Primarily what is disputed is the  proposed "signatories" -- those acceding to the agreement. Of  course if they want to political parties and social and  religious organizations and trade unions can take part in this  matter if they want.... But the state? What its role is is  unclear. If the proposed agreement reiterates the Constitution  then there is no need for it. There is still less need for it  if it goes beyond the framework of the Constitution.    Let me be frank. I have never been a supporter of the former  constitution, which was not democratic enough. Still less am I  a supporter of the present, entirely authoritarian constitution.  The history of all kinds of unconstitutional agreements did not  begin today and should seemingly have taught us something. An  imperfect law is better than any lawlessness.    If the Federation COuncil and the State Duma want to express  their support for civil peace, then let them adopt the relevant  appeal to the Russian peoples, political movements, religions,  and organs of power, including the president himself.    The facts make us doubt how seriously the authors of the  proposed agreement on accord are treating not only the  Constitution but also the agreement itself. Let me remind you  that article 5 of the Constitution stipulates the equality of  the components of the Federation as regards the federal organs  of power. The proposed draft agreement proposes a moratorium on  the conclusion of bilateral treaties on the demarcation of  powers between these organs and components. But what is  actually happening?    At the same time a treaty is being successfully concluded  between the Russian Federation and Tatarstan and the preparation  of a similar treaty with Chechnya is being announced. The  assessment of their expediency is a separate issue. But the  talks run counter to the Constitution and the draft agreement.  That is a medical fact, as they say. And will the agreement's  initiators punish themselves for violating it? And now?    On the social plane the document also gives rise to doubts.  Some agreement is being proposed "for everyone's attention."  The need to base it only on mutual concessions is perfectly  obvious. But the draft contains no real steps to meet the  demands of the "dissenters." For instance, trade unions are  given the duty of renouncing the organization of strikes  connected with the redistribution of budget funds. It would  seem that they might expect in response a promise to step up  social guarantees for hired workers. Nothing of the kind! The  president and government are "tossing" into the Duma a draft  budget which can only be assessed as antisocial, anti-education,  and anticulture. At a joint session of the State Duma and  Federation Council committees studying questions of education,  science, and culture, in my presence it was decided to vote  against the draft budget. And how could they do otherwise?    The president is not fulfilling his own edict no. 1. The  government is not fulfilling the president's edict and the  Russian Federation legislation on education and culture. My  conscience does not permit me to urge my colleagues who are  workers in education to abandon the struggle for their  legitimate demands by all legal means. The signing of the  agreement for the trade unions is tantamount to political  suicide!    A general political assessment should be based on the  feasibility or otherwise of the practical embodiment of the idea  involved. And so the country has been presented not with a  declaration on the mutual accord of the political forces but  with a protocol on universal agreement with the president!  Instead of uniting the country is now split into two camps:  those who agree with accord and those who do not. I do not  rule out the possibility that after the agreement has been  signed there will be a persecution of the "dissenters."  "Penalties" are already envisaged for them in the document.    If the president's side is really thinking of civil peace  and  not of propaganda campaigns it should suggest to the opposition  real countersteps: a new course in the economy, a government of  national trust in politics. Otherwise the draft is a noose.  The opposition should use it to tie its own hands, leaving its  opponents complete freedom of maneuver.    Without a new economic course and a government of national  trust a pact on civil accord in Russia is either another Utopian  idea or a trap for all those who disagree with their country's  destruction.</p>

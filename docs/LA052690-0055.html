			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> KOTOS ENLIVEN 'EAST / WEST' FEST  </P> <P> The Chamber Music/LA concert presented Thursday night at the Japan America  Theatre wasn't the most mellifluous event in the history of the enterprising  festival. However, it neatly underscored the official subtitle of this year's  series: "East/West Encounters."  </P> <P> The evening began with a rather aggressive performance of Erno Dohnany's  beguiling C-major Serenade for string trio (1902). Christiaan Bor (violin),  Milton Thomas (viola) and Jeffrey Solow (cello) played with obvious affection  and independent finesse. Ensemble values, unfortunately, turned out to be  somewhat sporadic, as did reliable intonation.  </P> <P> The evening ended with Dvorak's rhapsodic Piano Quartet in E-flat, Opus 87.  Here, Thomas and Solow were joined by pianist John Steele Ritter and violinist  Yukiko Kamei, the dedicated artistic director of the festival since its  inception in 1985.  </P> <P> This performance tended to veer toward stridency, just when one longed most for  suavity. Balance problems were aggravated by the brilliant-sounding Hamburg  Steinway, which consistently out-thumped the delicate strings. Still, one could  admire the pervasive brio.  </P> <P> The intriguing, drastically contrasting centerpiece was a welcome Asian  novelty: "Homura" by Tadao Sawai. Written in 1974, it is a bracing bravura  exercise for the 17-string bass koto, accompanied by an ensemble of  conventional 13-string kotos.  </P> <P> The koto, in case you have forgotten, is a long zither equipped with movable  frets. Its Japanese ancestry probably predates the Nara period (710-84). Sawai  has spent much of a prolific career augmenting the sonic possibilities of the  instrument and expanding its repertory to embrace experimental stylistic  procedures.  </P> <P> "Homura," which translates as fire, makes a splendid, mighty, gutsy noise. The  bold rhetorical outbursts of the solo koto reverberate with percussive drama  that seems to verge on violence. The support group adds neat textural echoes  and precise rhythmic punctuation.  </P> <P> Ears unaccustomed to the idiom can recognize modest flights of modal melody.  The primary appeal of the taut 15-minute piece, however, remains dynamic.  </P> <P> Kazue Sawai, the composer's wife, served as the dazzling protagonist. Makiko  Goto, Michie Yagi, Mieko Hayashi, Miho Okada, Ayako Kawai and Noriko Tsuboi  functioned as her faithful, ultra-disciplined allies.  </P> <P> The audience wasn't very big. It was, however, very enthusiastic.  </P></p>

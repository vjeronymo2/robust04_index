			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: CBS recovers with Dollars 19.5m profit in first three months CBS, the US media group, yesterday reported a first-quarter operating profit of Dollars 19.5m, a substantial recovery from the Dollars 54.6m loss incurred at the same stage of 1991 when the Gulf war, a slump in advertising demand and restructuring charges sent the company deep into the red. The earnings were greeted warmly on Wall Street, and CBS shares rose Dollars 6 1/2 to Dollars 184 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange in early trading. Improvements in operating results at the CBS's nationwide network and its group of regional television stations, and savings from reductions in underlying costs, were the main reason behind the turnround in earnings, said the company. Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman and chief executive of CBS, said the company was beginning to benefit from its new position as the top-ranked network in the US, a position which he believed would soon feed through into advertising revenues. However, the domestic advertising climate remained difficult in the first quarter. CBS's coverage of American football's Superbowl and the Albertville winter Olympics were a success, but excluding the revenue contribution from the two special sporting events, the network's first-quarter sales were essentially the same as a year ago. This was an indication that the weak economy continued to restrain demand for television advertising. A cyclical recovery in advertising demand is anticipated. Mr Tisch said there was evidence in the opening weeks of this year's second quarter of a 'steadying of demand for network time'. The company suffered from a big decline in interest income on investments during the quarter, which fell to Dollars 7.5m from Dollars 65.8m in the first three months of 1991, when sales of securities to fund a share buy-back operation and the final settlement of the sale of CBS's recorded music business brought windfall gains. Gannett, the newspaper publisher that owns USA Today, lifted net income for the first quarter to Dollars 55.5m or 39 cents a share from Dollars 50.1m, or 32 cents, for the same period last year. The increase came on revenue of Dollars 793.1m compared to Dollars 786.5m for the same period last year.</p>

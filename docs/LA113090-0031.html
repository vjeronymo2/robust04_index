			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 96 CRIPS, BLOODS ARRESTED DURING 'RED RAG' SWEEP;  </P> <P> GANGS: POLICE ROUND UP GANG MEMBERS ON DRUG CHARGES IN SEQUEL TO "OPERATION  BLUE RAG."  </P> <P> In a sequel to its highly touted "Operation Blue Rag," in which 77 Crip gang  members were arrested for drug sales, law enforcement officials rounded up 96  more Crip and Blood gang members during "Operation Red Rag" in East and  Southeast San Diego over the past three days.  </P> <P> The five-month "Red Rag" operation, so named to target the Piru, or Blood, gang  members, who favor red handkerchiefs, mirrored "Blue Rag," a nine-month  investigation that involved the West Coast Crips, who have adopted blue as  their color.  </P> <P> The 96 arrested in "Red Rag" is the single largest sweep of gang members in San  Diego's history, officials said, and will be repeated.  </P> <P> As in its initial operation, which ended last March, the San Diego Police  Department used a former gang member as a confidential informant armed with  money seized in previous drug raids to make dozens of drug buys, including rock  cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine, over five months.  </P> <P> The investigations differed in two ways. While "Blue Rag" included an informant  wired for sound, "Red Rag" included audiotaped and videotaped locations where  the informant would lure gang members before making buys. Dist. Atty. Edwin  Miller said the tapes will help make convictions easier when the cases get to  trial, probably before Christmas.  </P> <P> The second difference, investigators said, was the ease with which the "Red  Rag" informant was able to make buys from both Crip and Blood gang members.  Police had targeted the Bloods, but found that their informant was able to move  easily through Crips gang areas.  </P> <P> Of the 77 arrested during "Blue Rag," half are out of jail after serving six  months or less. With 96 more arrested, the two operations had an impact on more  than 4% of the 3,900 gang members registered with the police gang unit.  </P> <P> The relatively small percentage, law enforcement officials said, is significant  because the gang members targeted were among the most violent, most prone to  get involved in drive-by shootings, and the most heavily involved in dealing  drugs.  </P> <P> "The percentage of people we took out is not as important as who we took out,"  said police Sgt. Ross Stone, who led the department's investigation.  </P> <P> The operation also included help from the district attorney's office, the state  Justice Department's Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement, the federal Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the U.S. Attorney General's Office and the  county's probation department. "We may have 3,900 gang members out there, but  many of them are not as hard-core as others," he said. "Anybody can say he's in  a gang, but he may not be involved in drive-by shootings or other violent  crime."  </P> <P> Police Chief Bob Burgreen said the "Blue Rag" operation "kicked a hole, a big  hole into the Crips" of San Diego. "They are not back to where they were  before, and it will take months and months for them to recover and get back  into place."  </P> <P> Although 96 were arrested over the past three days, 112 gang members,  representing 13 gangs, were charged. The rest were being sought Thursday.  </P> <P> All but 12 were local gang members -- representing groups with names like the  "Eastside Piru" and "Upside Sic." The rest were from Los Angeles gangs, like  the "Raymond Avenue Crips" and the "L.A. Pueblo Bishop Crips."  </P> <P> The district attorney's office charged nine people and used the county grand  jury to indict 76 more. The U.S. attorney general's office used a federal grand  jury to indict 14. Eleven were charged in juvenile court, and two had their  probations revoked.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office rarely uses the county grand jury to lodge  criminal charges. But, with the June passage of Proposition 115, which did away  with lengthy preliminary hearings following grand jury indictments, prosecutors  can charge and bring defendants to trial more quickly. The absence of  preliminary hearings also keeps confidential informants from having to testify  until trial.  </P> <P> The arrests began at about 6 a.m. Tuesday, when more than 100 officers  representing six state and federal agencies began making arrests in East San  Diego, Emerald Hills, Logan Heights, Lincoln Park, near Skyline Drive, near  John F. Kennedy Park and other areas.  </P> <P> Most of the suspects were in their late teens and mid-20s. More than half had  prior felony convictions, and seven were suspects in gang-related murders or  attempted murders, the district attorney's office said. Twenty are on parole  and 20 more are on active probation.  </P> <P> Investigators confiscated seven weapons, including a sawed-off shotgun and  AK-47.  </P> <P> As in the "Blue Rag" operation, which used a confidential informant to set up  the drug buys and then testify against his former gang colleagues, "Red Rag"  used an informant who has been placed in the federal Witness Protection Program  and moved out of San Diego until the cases goes to trial.  </P> <P> The informant used $30,000 that had been seized in previous raids to buy drugs  from suspected gang members.  </P> <P> Miller said he wants as few trials as possible in order to protect the  informant and keep him out of public view as much as possible.  </P></p>

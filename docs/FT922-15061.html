			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Putting chips in the picture A camera on a chip could make life a lot tougher for criminals and reduce the number of false alarms. Automated Security Holdings (Ash) has developed a miniature video camera which, when triggered by a movement sensor, captures four video images at one-second intervals. These can then be transmitted to a police station or a communications centre for analysis. The system, called TVX, is based upon an Edinburgh University invention and uses a specially designed lens bonded directly on to the chip. Ash: UK, 071 435 7161.</p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> OXNARD MAN ACCIDENTALLY RUNS OVER, KILLS BABY DAUGHTER  </P> <P> An Oxnard man accidentally ran over and killed his 18-month-old daughter Monday  morning in the alley behind their home, police said.  </P> <P> Felipe Serrato, 22, had backed his 1976 Oldsmobile Cutlass into the alley  behind the 1200 block of West Fir Avenue, police traffic investigator Jeff  Shelton said.  </P> <P> As Serrato pulled forward, Adeline Serrato ran from the fenced yard and was  struck by the car.  </P> <P> "He didn't see her," Shelton said. "It happened so fast."  </P> <P> Adeline was pronounced dead at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard at  11:35 a.m., about 45 minutes after the accident.  </P> <P> An autopsy was pending, but Deputy Coroner Dale Zentzis said the cause of death  appeared to be head injuries.  </P> <P> No charges were filed, Shelton said. "It wasn't his fault," he said.  </P> <P> The baby's mother did not see the accident but was home when it occurred,  Shelton said, adding that the mother is seven months pregnant.  </P> <P> "The whole family has been destroyed," Serrato's brother, Melchor Serrato, said  in a telephone interview.  </P> <P> Speaking in Spanish as the parents and other family members sobbed in the  background, he said that Felipe Serrato is a farm worker and that the couple  have no other children.  </P> <P> "It's a sad one," Zentzis said. "The poor dad . . . that would be awful."  </P></p>

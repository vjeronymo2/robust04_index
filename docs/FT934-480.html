			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: S African industrials at record Steady demand for industrial shares took the Johannesburg industrials index up 64 to a record 5,262 in a continuation of the rally which has seen the sector rise 17 1/2 per cent since the Washington conference on the country's future on October 2, writes Michael Morgan. Copthall Martin in London noted that foreign demand has picked up substantially, particularly in the industrial sector over the last three months as the political process has proceeded more smoothly than many people had expected. The broker added that liquidity has also improved, with many local investors willing to cash in holdings as price/earnings ratios approached the 15 level. Ready demand from foreign buyers has since taken industrial stocks up to a current historical high of 16.6 times 1993 earnings. De Beers picked up from a day's low of R95 to end R1.25 easier at R96.50, still dogged by reports of leaks in its diamond supply deal with Russia. Golds advanced 22 to 2,094 and the overall index moved ahead 29 to 4,641.</p>

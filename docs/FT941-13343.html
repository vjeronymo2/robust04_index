			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Business and the Environment: Fading blueprint of a greener world - Bronwen Maddox reviews David Pearce's latest book as he scrutinises the UK's environmental performance David Pearce cannot be faulted on his timing. The book that made his name, Blueprint for a Green Economy, was published at the height of popular 'green' enthusiasm in 1989, when Pearce was adviser to Chris Patten, then UK environment secretary. His second, Blueprint 2, which tussled with global environmental threats, was published in 1991 in the run-up to the Rio Earth Summit. Now Blueprint 3*, which turns back to scrutinising the UK's environmental performance, arrives in the week in which the government publishes its strategy for 'sustainable development' - the UK's considered response to Rio. Pearce, now head of environmental economics at London University, has made an important contribution to the environmental debate in each of these books. He has argued steadily that values can - and should - be put on the environment in forming government policy. While that principle is anathema to those environmentalists who feel the environment is priceless, he should be thanked for it. Lack of such valuation leads to economic inefficiencies: people use too much of natural resources such as the capacity of the oceans or land to absorb pollution. The principle of valuation is also a good counterweight to the anti-liberal streak in the environmental movement: those campaigners who want to impose expensive conservation policies on the world without asking people whether they are happy to pay the price. In one of his most detailed valuations, Pearce argues that the 'social costs' of road use - noise, pollution, wear and tear on roads, congestion and accidents to pedestrians - amounted to between Pounds 23bn and Pounds 26bn in 1991. That was twice the amount fetched by road taxes; if the motorist were to pay the full cost of using the roads, taxes would need to double. He will also win gratitude from the packaging industry for pointing out that the piecemeal way in which the government is forming its waste management policy could be highly expensive for industry without yielding the desired environmental improvements. So far so good, although he is the first to acknowledge that such valuations are tentative and incomplete, particularly where they try to quantify the health effects of pollution. He also undermines some of his argument by adopting an academic's plaintive cry for theoretical perfection - he is distressed that 'policy tends to evolve as a series of reactions to particular issues rather than as a considered response to an exercise in which priorities are ranked according to agreed criteria'. But the more serious weakness of the book is its attempt to use these valuation techniques in defining the course of 'sustainable development' for the UK. 'Sustainable development' is a notoriously tricky concept which Pearce has grappled with in earlier work. He has in the past suggested two definitions. 'Strong' sustainability, according to Pearce, means maintaining a country's stock of natural resources, while 'weak' sustainability means maintaining a country's total capital, including both natural and man-made assets. But although Blueprint 3 treats these definitions as solid ground, safely won, gaping holes remain in his theories. It remains very hard to say what the definitions mean in practice. For example, in building new roads, a country would have to weigh the benefits to motor users against the acres of meadow which would be obliterated, to judge whether its overall capital - natural and man-made - was maintained. But how many butterflies and wildflowers are equivalent to how many miles of road? That persistent problem in defining capital handicaps him in his judgments about whether Britain's policies are sustainable - probably not, he concludes. It also makes it hard for him to develop one of the main parts of his argument: the proposition that if a country fails to value the environment properly, it is likely to be on an unsustainable path. Of the three strands in this book - valuation, sustainability and criticism of government policy - only the last is new. He has carried over much of the first two themes - including their weaknesses - from previous books. Those who have followed the development of Pearce's theories over the past four years may well feel the blueprint is getting fainter. * Blueprint 3 - Measuring Sustainable Development by David Pearce. 224pp, Pounds 10.95, Earthscan Publications.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Current Affairs" program] </F>   [Text] The Chinese Foreign Ministry says China favors a  moderately worded statement to be worked out by the UN Security  Council president to solve the nuclear issue on the Korean  Peninsula. Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin made the statement  Thursday in Beijing at his weekly press conference. Li Peichuan  was there.    [Begin recording] [Li Peichuan] Foreign Ministry spokesman  Wu Jianmin said a mild statement should be made in the name of  the president of the UN Security Council. He said the statement  should be designed to facilitate resumption of dialogue which is  the only correct way to settle the nuclear issue. Though Wu  Jianmin did not say whether China will veto a tough UN  resolution which will impose pressure on DPRK, he said China  does not accept such a resolution. He said exerting pressure  will only worsen the situation. When asked whether China has  common interests towards DPRK, the spokesman said yes. Earlier  the Chinese Foreign Ministry said the status of bilateral ties  should be judged by how many common interests two countries have.    [Wu Jianmin in Mandarin fading into English translation] We  have common interests toward both the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea because all of us...    [Li Peichuan] Wu Jianmin said regional peace and stability  are common concern of both China and two Koreas. The spokesman  said maintaining peace and stability are preconditions for  improving the living standards in all these countries and  assists the further development of economic and trade links  between them. Commenting on the upcoming visit to China by  French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur next week, Wu Jianmin  said it is of political significance, it will help improve ties  between Beijing and Paris. He said maintaining a good political  relationship is a solid foundation for developing economic and  trade ties. On another topic, the Foreign Ministry spokesman  repeated China's continued support for the peace process in  South Africa. Violence has increased recently in some part of  the country as the first all-race elections are approaching. Wu  Jianmin said China hopes all parties concerned will overcome  their differences through negotiations so as to ensure a smooth  general election which is scheduled for late April.

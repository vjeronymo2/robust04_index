When he was young, he lived and studied at a temple. He  became a monk and continued his studies until he had received a  mid-level diploma in religion.    During 1952 to 1953 he was with the freedom movement  struggling for national independence.    During the period from 1970 to 1975 he was with the movement  for national salvation under the leadership of His Majesty  Norodom Sihanouk, head of the United National Front for Harmony  in Cambodia. During this period, he was named as a chairman of a  canton administration, and later a chairman of the district  administration.    In 1975, because he saw clearly the danger threatening the  lives of the people of Cambodia, he and his group led their  forces in resisting the genocidal regime.    On 2 December 1978, he was assigned to be deputy chairman of  the United Front for Solidarity to Redeem Cambodia.    After the overthrow of the genocidal regime on 7 January  1979, he was assigned to be a member of the People's  Revolutionary Assembly of Cambodia as well as Minister of  Interior for the Cambodian Government.    During the 12 years since 1981 he has been elected chairman  of the United Front for Solidarity, Construction and Defense of  the Cambodian Motherland; a member of the People's Assembly from  Prey Veng Province; and chairman of the National Assembly of the  Cambodian Government.    In the recent period of peace and national harmony -- which  was brought about through the national elections held in May  1993 under the supervision of the temporary UN authority in  Cambodia, he was elected as a member of the assembly from Phnom  Penh.    He was elected as the president of the National Assembly  during the very first meeting of the Assembly of the Kingdom of  Cambodia.

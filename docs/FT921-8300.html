			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Wielding a sharp scalpel  -Back from the brink / One company doctor's prescriptions THE vast majority of people only start their own companies 'because they are completely unemployable'. Given remarks like that, it is just as well that Danny Chapchal, a company doctor who has brought more than one business back from the brink, says he does not set out to be liked. He aims, however, to win the respect of those working around him, even if he spends quite a lot of time casting doubt on the business acumen of British managers and on the commitment of the financial institutions which back them. Chapchal is a 46-year-old accountant who started up and sold his own electronic components company in the 1960s before going on to help a string of struggling, small and medium-sized businesses back on their feet. He is now chief executive of SQL Systems International, a Surrey-based management systems software company, after venture capitalist investors invited him in to help stem mounting losses. Subsidiaries have been sold off, jobs have gone and annual turnover has been trimmed back from Pounds 9m to Pounds 5m. The company, however, is profitable again. Chapchal, who says he cannot function without classical music playing in the background, sees himself as a sort of corporate Furtwangler, Toscanini or Karajan. 'Furtwangler said a good conductor can turn the village band into the philharmonic but a bad one can turn the philharmonic into the village band.' There are, he says, nothing like enough good conductors within the ranks of Britain's smaller businesses. Many of the record numbers of companies now falling into the hands of receivers never stood a chance, he says, even if the economy had gone from boom to boom. 'Two basic types start companies. The minority have a brilliant idea, know where their strengths begin and end, and recognise the need to bring on board other skills right from the start. They might succeed. But the rest are super-idealists who have started out on their own because they have got fed up with big business and want to get away from controls and planning and strategy. 'The first employees are friends and everyone gets a Rover. They pretend everyone is equal and no-one takes any decisions if someone is going to get hurt. 'The end result is a terribly immature business culture in which discipline breaks down and no-one is in overall charge. I went into one company and no-one knew it was Pounds 1.5m in debt. 'Too many companies still think of management as a necessary evil. But there has to be a boss, someone to say yes and no and to focus and direct their energies. It all sounds so obvious but many new companies think they can do it differently.' Chapchal says start-ups nearly always make the same fundamental mistakes: 'They invariably underestimate by half the amount of capital they require, they are under-resourced in staff terms and are slow to react to changes in relevant technology'. But surely every business has to start modestly, to learn to walk before it can run? 'Absolutely, but its no good if you are even unable to crawl. If you can't begin with certain fundamental strengths, then you are going nowhere.' He joins in the chorus of criticism over the low priority afforded to research and development but says that, even when it is adequately financed, it is often misdirected. 'There is a tremendous temptation for UK companies to be technology-led, but the real challenge is to be market-led and backed up by technological know-how.' Sound professional advice, he adds, is often forsaken by small business in a 'we know best' approach, although he is also withering about the general level of practical expertise among the bankers who take it upon themselves to spot winners and identify losers. 'Most of them have absolutely no comprehension of running a business. So much so, they don't even realise when things start to go horribly wrong. If a company goes bust overnight, it is not the only one at fault.' Chapchal is also critical of the investment community, which he says remains stubbornly attached to the concept of quick returns. 'The average venture capitalist wants to get out within three to five years. In Europe it is five to eight years, or longer if necessary.' Chapchal says he is now looking for something big to tackle. 'I've done a few smaller companies and would like to get my hands on something in deep trouble which ought not to die, but will unless it gets help. Big or small, if companies take their eye off the ball, they're out'.</p>

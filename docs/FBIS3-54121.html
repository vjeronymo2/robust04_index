			<p>Language: <F P=105>English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by journalist J.L. Kaul] </F>   [Text] India has welcomed the major aspects of the January  14th Moscow Declaration on nuclear nonproliferation as broadly  what India has been advocating. India considers any step, big  or small, aimed at general and complete disarmament to end all  weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, as a  positive development. It has, however, refrained from signing  the present Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] as New Delhi  considers it to be discriminatory. The treaty in effect tackles  only the countries without nuclear weapons and not those in the  nuclear club. The treaty virtually seeks to legitimize and  perpetuate the retention of nuclear weapons in the hands of a  few countries.    India's stress on general and complete elimination of  nuclear  stockpiles stems from its ethos. The land of Lord Mahavir and  Lord Buddha has always believed in peace and tranquility and in  avoiding the path of confrontation. During recent past, India  achieved the distinction of having won its freedom through  nonviolence. The world now stands at a threshold so far as  stock piling of nuclear weapons is concerned. Even if there is  no direct confrontation, the mere presence of these stockpiles  poses immense threat to the security of mankind. World public  opinion by and large has been in favor of complete elimination  of such weapons and a ban on their further production.    Outside the arena of international politics, there are  eminent personalities who have hailed India's demand for  complete elimination of nuclear weapons and its refusal to sign  the discriminatory NPT. Dr. Thanat Khoman, internationally  known jurist and diplomat and Thailand's former deputy prime  minister and founder member of ASEAN, said in New Delhi in last  November that India did the right thing in not signing the  discriminatory NPT. The London-based leader of Campaign For  Nuclear Disarmament (CND), Mr. Bruce Kent, at the end of his  two-week tour of India a couple of days ago said that nuclear  powers do not have a right, moral or otherwise, to preach  nonproliferation to the rest of the world. He said the NPT  itself is not just about nonproliferation, but about disarmament  as a whole and it has been made to look as if the whole issue is  only about stopping non-nuclear states from crossing the nuclear  threshold. The CND leader added that the nuclear powers have  won pretty little to fulfill their own NPT obligations of  shedding their own nuclear arsenals. The ground reality also  points to this direction.    Far from eliminating their nuclear arsenals, the latest and  the 39th explosion conducted by China on the fifth of October  1993 has belied the hopes of even a nuclear test moratorium.  The discriminatory nature of the current NPT is also clear from  the fact that whereas the United States showed tremendous  concern about Iraq's nuclear capability because it posed a  threat to Israel, the same concern has not been shown about  Pakistan's nuclear program because it is aimed at India. On the  contrary, it is widely believed that Pakistan's nuclear  capability was actually built somewhat within the knowledge of  Washington.    Keeping the discriminatory nature of the present NPT in  view,  India has affirmed the need to alter the treaty on  non-discriminatory basis. The NPT review conference is to be  held next year and India has not accepted the suggestion that  the treaty should be extended indefinitely and unconditionally  in its present form. Public opinion, even in Western countries  too, is (?gearing) round to a recognition that attempts should  be made to dispense with nuclear weapons. There is now a  growing realization in America too that the arms race made the  United States the world biggest debtor. Both Germany and Japan  have also started to question the discriminatory nature of the  NPT. Japan has been the only country to have suffered the  consequences of a nuclear attack and India in keeping with its  commitment to general disarmament has urged Japan to take  advantage of the opportunity next year at NPT review conference  for removing its discriminatory nature. India has also asked  Japan to join India in its initiative at the UN for a convention  prohibiting the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons as  necessary first step for the elimination and prevention of  nuclear war. Efforts at nongovernmental level aimed at complete  disarmament and a comprehensive test ban are also going apace.  Former U.S. Defense Secretary Mr. Robert McNamara, has revealed  in Bangalore recently that Indian and American experts have  agreed to an action plan to work for freeing the world from  nuclear arsenals.</p>

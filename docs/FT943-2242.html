			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Observer: Pussy footing Alexander Kwasniewski, who last year led Poland's reformed communists back to power in coalition with the Peasants' party, is not normally backwards in coming forward. But, mention his possible candidacy for next year's presidential election, and he comes over all shy. Lech Walesa, the current incumbent, is deeply unpopular, while Kwasniewski tops the opinion polls. The latter's main worry, however, seems to be that, if he stands, Walesa could wage the sort of bare-knuckle anti-communist campaign that secured him victory in 1990. In London yesterday, Kwasniewski thus confined himself to saying that Poland needs a president who spends more time on pushing Poland's entry into the European Union and Nato, and less on domestic political infighting. No-one's fooled. That's code for 'I'm your man'. Being president has to be better than trying to control a fractious coalition, or forging a new constitution out of the seven competing drafts now on the table - two of the wearisome tasks on Kwasniewski's plate.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A delegation from the Arab Democratic Party, led by  'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, has met with some Palestinian leaders,  including Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic  Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Hawatimah briefed our  radio on the meeting:    [Begin Hawatimah recording] The meeting reviewed the current  situation in light of the results of the Oslo and Cairo accords.  The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre was the bitter, dirty fruit of  these accords, which legitimized the presence of settlements in  Gaza and Jericho and completely ignored settlements and settlers  in the West Bank and greater Jerusalem.    In light of the dialogue that took place, brother  'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah said his party completely reject the  Cairo agreement and have some observations on the Oslo accord.  For our part, we used clear, direct language to ask him and his  party to reconsider their position on the Oslo accord and to not  support this accord. We also asked him to join the opposition  to the Rabin government, because Rabin pursues the same policy  as Likud, but embellishes his language. The intifadah in the  occupied territories and its expansion into Israel and along the  Galilee, the Triangle, the Negev, and the coast indicates the  Arab Democratic Party and the Democratic Front for Peace and  Equality should reconsider their ties with the Rabin government.  In addition, all democratic, leftist, and peaceful forces in  Israel should reconsider their stands in order to annul the Oslo  and Cairo accords and restructure the entire political,  negotiating process within the framework of international  resolutions. This would truly lead to full withdrawal in return  for full peace, a full, balanced peace based on the  establishment of a Palestinian state next to the State of  Israel, the Palestinian people's right to self-determination,  and resolving the problem of the refugees in line with UN  Resolution 194.

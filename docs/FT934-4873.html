			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Left-winger takes Labour leadership in New Zealand Ms Helen Clark, a former university lecturer who was elected early yesterday as leader of New Zealand's opposition Labour party, has indicated that she wants to turn Labour back to its socialist roots, and has spoken of the need to raise taxes to help the underprivileged. A left-wing group, led by activist women party workers, achieved their aim of seeing Ms Clark elected. The caucus vote, by 26 to 19, ended a gruelling and bitter battle to oust Mr Mike Moore, who argued that Labour should be a centrist party, with appeal to all sections of the community. Mr Moore, who was consistently rated among New Zealand's most popular politicians, argued that those who plotted against him overlooked his role in holding the party together after its devastating 1990 loss, leading to its near win in the general election three weeks ago. In an apparent effort to retain the backing of Moore supporters, many of whom back the shift to the right of recent years, the party caucus voted to appoint Mr David Caygill as deputy leader. Mr Caygill is on the right of the party and as finance minister in 1988 and 1989 after the sacking of reformist Sir Roger Douglas continued to promote monetarist economic solutions. The appointment of Mr Caygill is seen as a further blow to Mr Moore, who wanted Dr Michael Cullen, Labour's finance spokesman, to be deputy leader. It is being widely questioned how Mr Caygill will be able to accept the left-wing agenda that Ms Clark is promoting. During the election Mr Caygill spoke against any significant watering down of legislation which deregulated the labour market, and is also believed to oppose tax increases. The party divisions and deep rifts that opened during the battle to oust Mr Moore, are leading to growing beliefs that Labour cannot survive for long in its present form, and that the right-wing group may form a new party. There is also talk that some right-wing MPs from the ruling National party may join such a group, in anticipation that they would achieve a degree of political power under the German proportional voting system which will be used in the next election. Adding to the confusion, Mr Moore also said last week that if he was defeated he would consider forming a 'new' Labour party, although yesterday he pledged that he would continue to support Labour. Ms Clark is the first woman to lead a main New Zealand political party. She said yesterday the party needed to find ways to work together in the spirit of consensus politics. 'Above all we need to build a compassionate Labour party which serves the needs of all New Zealanders.'</p>

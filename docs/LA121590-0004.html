			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ETHICS HEARINGS AND CRANSTON  </P> <P> During the 1980s I can remember reading about the idolization of Donald Trump,  Michael Milken, Charles Keating, Ronald Reagan, Neil Bush and countless other  individuals who robbed and spent our country into a trillion-dollar debt.  </P> <P> Now that we must pay back this huge debt, all of them are pulling out empty  pockets and pointing their finger at someone else.  </P> <P> I assert that the 1980s can be characterized as the "me" generation and the  1990s can be characterized as the "not me" generation.  </P> <P> JOHN PECORA, Lake Elsinore  </P></p>

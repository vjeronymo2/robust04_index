			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] </F>   [Text] Moscow hopes that the second ministerial meeting for  Bosnia is going to take place before the end of June. This was  disclosed in a Monday interview with INTERFAX by a high-ranking  official at the Russian Foreign Ministry.    The G-7 summit in Naples at the beginning of July is the  deadline before the foreign ministers of Russia, the USA,  Britain, France, Germany, Greece and Belgium must get together,  the official said.    The diplomat hopes that technical matters can be resolved in  a matter of days and the working schedules of ministers  coordinated. "There is a more difficult problem, though. All  possible actions of each of the conflicting Bosnian sides must  be predicted", he said. The international community should have  something in store, if one or both conflicting sides reject the  plan approved during the first ministerial meeting.    Under the plan Bosnian Serbs should get 49 percent of the  territory and the federation of Muslims and Croats 51 percent.    The Russian diplomat felt that Geneva would again host the  ministerial meeting. "The leaders of the conflicting sides will  evidently also be invited to Geneva. It is not clear, however,  whether they are going to attend the meeting or whether the  ministers will find another way of communicating with them", the  official said.</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIBERY AFFAIR TURNS UP NEWPORT HERO  </P> <P> Orange Countians have a renewed confidence in the strength of their American  democracy and Newport Beach citizens have a new hero in their midst with the  story (Jan. 5) of the courageous service provided by Newport's Planning  Commission chairman, Buzz Person, in derailing the attempt by a local  restaurant owner to subvert the democratic process of our government through  bribery. Such undercover corruption gnaws at the very vitals of American  democracy. But to know we have a public servant with guts and integrity who  could call this illegal and unpatriotic attempt on its own ground, gives us all  hope and new faith in America.  </P> <P> Newporters have reason to be proud of their community, and we all have a new  hero -- Buzz Person!  </P> <P> If there is a cloud in the affair, it is the tap-on-the-wrist sentence on the  perpetrator by Judge Margaret Anderson. If a judge does not understand any  better the threat to America that lack of integrity in government brings, then  she should get off the bench.  </P> <P> TOM PENDELL  </P> <P> Balboa  </P></p>

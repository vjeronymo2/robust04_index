			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, 22 Jun (MENA)--The Lebanese newspaper  AL-SAFIR reports that the Egyptian Government has warned Israel  through diplomatic channels against escalating the military  situation in southern Lebanon and wrecking the entire peace  process. The paper cites diplomatic sources as saying that the  Egyptian warning to Israel came in the light of diplomatic  information that the Israeli army is preparing to launch a  military operation against Lebanon soon.    AL-SAFIR says that the Lebanese Government has received  information that Israel is preparing for a military operation  against Lebanon. The paper says that the Israeli General Staff  is planning a military operation supervised by Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who ordered that such an operation be  quick and painful.    Lebanese Foreign Ministry sources say that Lebanese  diplomatic circles are conducting intensive contacts with Arab  and international quarters to contain the escalation of Israeli  attacks against Lebanon.    The past few days have witnessed serious escalation in  Israeli air and ground attacks against Hizballah positions in  southern Lebanon and the western al-Biqa' as well as continuous  Israeli shelling of al-Nabatiyah and Iqlim al-Tuffah areas.  These attacks left a number of civilians dead or wounded,  destroyed many houses, and set crop fields on fire.</p>

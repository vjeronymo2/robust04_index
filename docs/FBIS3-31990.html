			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 28 Jan (AFP) -- Guatemalan President  Ramiro De Leon Carpio said today that the Central American  countries will support Costa Rican Foreign Affairs Minister  Bernd Niehaus on his bid to be OAS secretary general. De Leon,  who is in Honduras on an official visit, told the media that  Colombian President Cesar Gaviria requested support for his  possible candidacy to the OAS post, but "we have a commitment  that we must keep unless a reason unrelated to said agreement  prevents us from doing so."    The Guatemalan president participated in the inauguration of  liberal lawyer Carlos Reina, the new Honduran president, on 27  January. Before he returned to Guatemala today, De Leon also  participated in the closing of the Central American Parliament  plenary sessions.    Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani and President Reina  also expressed their support for Niehaus, although the new  Honduran president reiterated his position of supporting Gaviria  should the Costa Rican foreign minister fail to win in the first  round of the elections. Reina told the media that "we like very  much other rulers who want the post."    Confronted by the media, Nicaraguan President Violeta  Chamorro refused to address this topic and only said that "the  vote is secret." Some inferred that she tacitly supported  Gaviria in violation of the Central American commitment.    Gaviria, who also attended the protocol acts in Tegucigalpa,  met briefly with several regional leaders who attended the  inauguration on 27 January. He denied that he was lobbying for  his candidacy and pointed out that they discussed only issues of  common interest such as trade and technical cooperation.  Gaviria said that he is studying the launching of his  candidacy, proposed by other countries, before making a decision.    The selection of the new OAS secretary general is scheduled  for March 1994, and the United States has publicly backed  President Gaviria.    Besides Niehaus, who claims to have 23 votes so far (18 are  needed to win the election), former Foreign Ministers Carlos  Iturralde (Bolivia) and Miguel Angel Burelli (Venezuela), who  has also lobbied in Honduras lately, were also nominated to the  post.</p>

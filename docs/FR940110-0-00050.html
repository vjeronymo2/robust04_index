Several commenters interpreted this language as a statement of the scope of services that are allowable under the National Workplace Literacy Program, believed that this scope had been defined too narrowly, and urged that it be expanded to include a variety of activities. It was also suggested that a project be permitted to provide any services identified in a needs assessment. One commenter asked whether use of the term ``jobs or job functions'' was intended to shift focus away from job-specific competencies of current job titles to broader competencies that are identified in the report issued by the Department of Labor Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS). The commenter asked that the Department clarify or define which jobs or job functions have ``broad representation within the Nation's workforce.'' Other commenters stated that a broader scope of services is needed to meet the National Education Goals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 472.22(a)(5) is a selection criterion used to evaluate applications and is not a statement of the scope of allowable program services. That scope is stated in &sect;472.3, which reflects sections 371(a)(1) and (3) of the Adult Education Act, and lists allowable activities. Many activities mentioned by the commenters, such as speaking, listening, reasoning, problem-solving, team building, GED preparation, and meeting the literacy needs of adults with limited English proficiency, are allowable under &sect;472.3. Further guidance on the scope of allowable activities is included in the notice inviting applications published elsewhere in this issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Generally, workplace literacy projects teach literacy skills needed in the workplace that improve the productivity of the workforce. The program is not a program of general adult education and cannot serve needs that are not directly related to the workplace. At the same time, projects serving needs that are directly related to the workplace are encouraged to use creative approaches to stimulate workers' interests and to develop individualized education plans that reflect workers' goals. See &sect;472.22(c)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the language encouraging a focus on nationally representative jobs or job functions is to enhance the capability of a project to demonstrate results that can be adapted by similar employers and industries. Section 472.22(a)(5) was not proposed specifically to respond to the recommendations of the SCANS report, nor was the report intended to modify the scope of services under the workplace literacy program. The Secretary believes that it is unnecessary to define by regulation what jobs or job functions are broadly representative. Applicants are encouraged to make their own evaluation of current and future labor market conditions, and design a project that can help similar workplaces in the future. This should assist in meeting National Education Goal 5, that every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Selection Criteria_Demonstration (&sect;472.22(h)) (Proposed &sect;472.22(h)(1))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters agreed that the Department should emphasize dissemination activities, and recommended the inclusion of various other dissemination strategies. Two commenters were concerned that dissemination activities could be hampered because the instructional materials produced by a project might contain protected information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter suggested that, because carrying out both the demonstration and commitment activities described in proposed &sect;472.22(h)(1) and (2) would be overwhelming, applicants should be asked to address only one of these criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The dissemination strategies listed in proposed &sect;472.22(h)(1) are among the regulatory changes designed to transform the National Workplace Literacy Program into a true demonstration program. See the previous discussion of the background of these regulations and note also &sect;472.31(c), which requires that a project be independently evaluated for ``spread'' and ``transportability'' to other sites. Proposed &sect;472.22(h)(1) encouraged applicants to use certain dissemination strategies but was not intended to preclude the use of additional strategies when they are appropriate for a particular project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary does not expect or anticipate that partnerships will disseminate trade secrets or other protected information. However, a project's dissemination activities should clearly benefit businesses and workplaces outside of the partnership.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While, ideally, all partners will be involved in demonstration and commitment activities, these activities may be accomplished through the efforts of particular partners. The Secretary desires that the factors listed in the criteria on ``Demonstration'' and ``Commitment'' be reflected in an applicant's program design, management plan, and budget. However, the Secretary does not anticipate that addressing both criteria will be burdensome if partners adequately plan and budget for them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The selection criterion ``Demonstration and commitment'' in proposed &sect;472.22(h) has been separated into a criterion on ``Demonstration'' in &sect;472.22(h) and a criterion on ``Commitment'' in &sect;472.22(i). Also see the discussion on &sect;472.22(i).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Selection Criteria_Commitment (&sect;472.22(i)) (Proposed &sect;472.22(h)(2))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

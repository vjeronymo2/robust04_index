			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THORNBURGH PREDICTS JUSTICES WILL REVERSE ABORTION RULING  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh predicted Friday that the Supreme Court will  overrule its landmark decision legalizing abortion this year and turn the issue  "back to the states."  </P> <P> In a rare comment by the government's top legal officer on a pending court  case, Thornburgh said in a television interview, to be broadcast today, that it  was "my guess" that the outcome of a new test case on the issue would be  abandonment of the 1973 decision that assured women a constitutional right to  end pregnancy.  </P> <P> The Reagan Administration, in a document that Thornburgh approved, had urged  the Supreme Court to use a case from Missouri as the vehicle for taking a new  look at the controversy, which could lead to an overruling.  </P> <P> Last Monday, the court put the Missouri case on its docket for the current  term, indicating that a final ruling is likely before summer, following an  April hearing.  </P> <P> Thornburgh, in an interview taped for broadcast on the Cable News Network's  "Evans and Novak" program, cautioned that "anyone who predicts what the court's  going to do does so at a great deal of risk."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the attorney general went on to make a prediction, saying: "My  sense would be that if they choose to act -- and that's what we have suggested  -- that the most likely result would be that they would turn it back to the  states."  </P> <P> At Senate hearings last year, when he was named attorney general, Thornburgh  had said he would seek out a case to test the court's willingness to keep the  1973 decision intact.  </P></p>

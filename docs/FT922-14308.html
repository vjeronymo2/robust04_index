			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / City launches initiative to meet business debt A JOINT initiative to help sole traders with business debt and families with multiple debt is to be launched today in Newcastle upon Tyne by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux and Newcastle City Council. The scheme is the first such initiative between CAB and local authority counsellors in the country. Last year local authorities contributed Pounds 27m of the national association's Pounds 38m annual budget. Newcastle upon Tyne has seen personal debt increase sharply, with 103 personal bankruptcy cases being recorded in the city for the first two months of this year - more than the total for the whole of 1980. Newcastle City Council sees the initiative as a way of enhancing services at a time when the council faces large budget cuts. The national association believes the initiative may encourage local authorities to tackle rent and poll tax arrears without resorting to sending in bailiffs.</p>

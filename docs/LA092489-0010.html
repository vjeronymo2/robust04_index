			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: READING AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHS: IMAGES AS HISTORY BY ALAN  TRACHTENBERG (HILL &amp; WANG: $25; 326 PP.)  </P> <P> Photographs say much about the eye of the beholder -- what Emerson called "the  transcendental eyeball." Alan Trachtenberg offers glimpses into the perceptions  and values of photographers and their pictures, "a history of photographers  employing their medium to make sense of their society." Trachtenberg focuses  not on the subject matter in pictures, but rather on "the point of view of the  photograph itself, the interpretation it allows viewers to make of its  subject." Insofar as there is a single theme to the book, it is that American  photography has represented -- often in spite of itself -- the violent economic  and social upheavals of the hundred years beginning with the emergence of the  art in 1839 and ending with the publication of Walker Evans' "American  Photographs" in 1938.  </P> <P> Trachtenberg zeros in on five time periods; following the current fad, he calls  them "moments." The first deals with the era of the daguerreotype and considers  the portraiture of illustrious Americans and the elitist Roman models of civic  virtue they convey. The second treats the Civil War, in particular Mathew  Brady's photographic chronicle. The third takes up post-Civil War photographers  of the Western natural views that would soon be familiar to tourists (like  Yosemite and the Rockies). The fourth presents photographers as social  commentators from the 1880s to World War I. The last concentrates on Walker  Evans' photos from the 1920s and '30s; these, Trachtenberg says, use  photography as a political art to present the theme of American anonymity. The  book moves implicitly from the portraiture of an identifiable ruling elite to  the anonymity of Evans' vision, reflective of populist transformations in the  American political and social consciousness.  </P> <P> The fact that the movement is only implicit points to a failure to knit  together the discrete chapters. Trachtenberg, a professor of American Studies,  makes the all-too-common mistake of confusing textual analysis -- "reading" --  with historical analysis and understanding. The clutter of critical  paraphernalia of recent literary fads from Foucault to Barthes detracts from  the substantial merits of the book and lends an obscurity to the exposition.  However, when Trachtenberg allows his quest for the meanings of the photographs  to take him to literary sources he clearly knows well (Hawthorne, Melville,  Emerson) that his writing is persuasive and exciting.

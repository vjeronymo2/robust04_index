			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: Fixed interest yields weaken FIXED interest investments such as onshore bond funds and permanent interest bearing shares continue to offer attractive yields, in spite of weakening since last month, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. Onshore bond funds Performance has been boosted by the slide in interest rates, which has led to capital appreciation. The outlook depends on the direction of interest rates - if these fall further, prices will rise. But few fund managers expect the same level of gains that were achieved in the past few years. The best-performing fund over three years, according to Micropal, is Aetna Preference unit trust which, like the Gartmore trust also listed in the table, invests primarily in preference shares (shares in a company yielding a fixed rate of interest). Geoff Burton, director of fixed-interest securities at Aetna and manager of the fund, attributes the strong performance to the narrowing of margins between yields on preference shares and gilts. The Aetna fund has also benefited from old issues of preference shares being repaid. Its largest holdings are in Evered Bardon, the international building materials group, Bulmer Holdings, which makes cider and soft drinks, and Prowtner, the house-builder. Aetna UK has been sold to Windsor Life and the company will be changing its name by September. Windsor Life is owned by New York Life, the large US life company. Permanent interest bearing shares Yields on Pibs - fixed interest-paying shares issued by building societies to raise money - are continuing to drop as prices rise. Simon Mozeley, of Hoare Govett, says: 'Pibs continue to see strong demand and, with strong gilt performance, yields have continued to trade below 10 per cent, with Halifax now yielding around 9.5 per cent. 'The Newcastle issues have broken 10 per cent and look expensive when larger societies, such as the Britannia, give more than this.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    Best performing 10 UK bond funds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fund                        Size (poundsm)     Yield (%)     Perf*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Aetna Pref                       18.8             8.5        53.2 MIMstar Gilt &amp; FI                 2.7             7.8        49.6 Barclays Unicorn                145.9             8.2        47.1 Fidelity Gilt &amp; FI               25.0             7.2        46.4 Gartmore Pref                     3.7             8.3        44.5 Framlington Gilt                 13.9             6.8        43.9 Legal &amp; Gen FI                    1.0             6.3        43.8 Henderson FI                      8.3             7.9        42.1 ManuLife Gilt &amp; FI               32.4             7.2        41.9 Axa Equity &amp; Law Gilt            73.8             6.2        41.0 Sector average                   18.0             6.7        37.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Micropal. ????

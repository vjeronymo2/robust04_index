			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Letter: Inexperienced directors Sir, In your article, 'Sony chief says accountants should not lead industry', (February 7) I could not agree more with Mr Akio Morita. Only I would dare to go further in saying that the basic experience of entire boards of directors of most companies today are founded on heavy financial backgrounds. This leaves the important decisions being made by managers who have no true understanding of their own manufactured product. And, worse, it leaves no common ground in their relations with the workforce, which itself is rich in the grassroots experience required for the overall creation of the product. That detachment can most definitely lead to great, and unnecessary, financial and labour losses. S Willis, 6A Wrangledon Road, Parkwood, Maidstone, Kent ME15 9LS</p>

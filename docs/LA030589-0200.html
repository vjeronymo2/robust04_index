			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANY STRANDED BY CANCELLATIONS AT LAX  </P> <P> As a nationwide Eastern Airlines strike forced the carrier to cancel all of its  flights out of Los Angeles International Airport on Saturday, frustrated  travelers found themselves arguing with ticket agents, sprinting between  terminals in search of alternative flights and, in some cases, making  preparations to spend an extra, unplanned evening in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Despite the airline's early-morning assurances that their flights would not be  canceled, many would-be Eastern passengers found themselves confronted with two  monitors showing a white line drawn through the 15 flights scheduled to depart  for everywhere from Atlanta to Bogota.  </P> <P> And, starting Monday, hundreds of Southern Californians who commute to Los  Angeles by train from San Diego, Santa Barbara and elsewhere may find  themselves in a similar situation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Amtrak May Be Struck  </P> <P> A secondary strike by railway workers may affect cities along the Eastern  Seaboard as well as Amtrak commuter trains in Southern California, according to  officials of the International Assn. of Machinists. Officials estimate that  2,200 Southern Californians board Amtrak trains each day for trips to Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> "We fully expect to have secondary pickets up on our property," Amtrak  spokesman John Jacobsen said Saturday. "At Amtrak, we are taking nothing for  granted. Maybe the whole system gets shut down. We won't know until 5 to 6 a.m.  Monday."  </P> <P> A secondary strike is one in which union members in an unrelated company walk  out in sympathy with a union engaged in a dispute. Although the practice has  been outlawed for most of the economy since 1947, exceptions are allowed in the  case of transportation companies.  </P> <P> At the airport, Christina Varas, standing near the Eastern Airlines ticket  counter, shook her head as she prepared to drive her mother and father back to  Encino.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plans Were Confirmed  </P> <P> "We learned two days ago that they were going to strike, so we started calling,  but even last night they said they weren't going to cancel the international  flights," said Varas, whose parents were scheduled to take a canceled 1:30 p.m.  flight home to Buenos Aires. "We had frequent flyer tickets and no other  airline will honor them. (And besides,) all the other companies are booked."  </P> <P> Activity at the Eastern terminal at LAX ranged from picketing to pacing. More  than 200 union workers marched with placards outside the building while dozens  of disgruntled travelers ran back and forth between the ticket counters.  </P> <P> "Do you know what a yo-yo is?" asked an angry Las Burger, who for more than an  hour had been trying to get himself, his wife and two friends on a flight to  Miami. "That's what we are, between (the ticket counters of) Continental and  Eastern. . . . Nobody wants to accept any responsibility."  </P> <P> It was a sentiment echoed by many who had trouble getting other airlines to  honor their tickets, although Eastern agents had made promises to the contrary.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Extra Ticket Expense  </P> <P> "They (Eastern representatives) called me the night before and said they'd put  me on Pan Am," said Michelle Judd, 21. She had bought a $500, round-trip  Eastern ticket from Miami to Los Angeles, only to find on arriving at the Pan  Am counter in Miami that she had to buy another ticket. "That was another  $250," said the college student.  </P> <P> And Judd said she will probably spend a further $250 for a ticket on another  airline before the week is through, since she has no intention of flying back  on Eastern.  </P> <P> "I'll never fly Eastern again, even if it's the last airline available," she  said. "They knew how many people this (strike) would affect and I don't see how  they could let this happen."  </P> <P> But anger and disappointment were not the only emotions vented by the delayed  passengers. Many also expressed sympathy, for the workers outside on the picket  line and for the ticket agents behind the counters.  </P></p>

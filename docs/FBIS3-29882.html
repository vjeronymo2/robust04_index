			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 23 (YONHAP) -- Japan appealed to South  Korea Wednesday to eliminate illegal fishing near its waters  that totals over 1,000 cases a year. The Japanese also voiced  concern about the depletion of fishing stocks and disputes over  accidents between vessels from the two countries, Foreign  Ministry officials said.    Seoul and Tokyo sat down Tuesday and Wednesday for mid-level  negotiations on renewing the self-regulation fishing agreement  that expires at the end of this year. The two sides focused on  South Korean vessels' illegal fishing activities despite  governmental agreement on self-regulation, disputes and  compensation from accidents, and formal mechanisms to protect  marine resources.    The talks' key point is whether the two countries should  overhaul the 1965 basic fishing accord as demanded by Tokyo, or  just institute supplementary measures as insisted by Seoul,  according to the officials.    South Korea established various regulations covering  Japanese  fishing in its waters in the 1965 agreement, while Japan  virtually opened all its waters beyond 12 nautical miles. The  action came at a time when South Korean fishing vessels were too  small and too few to compete with the Japanese.    In 1987 the two countries adopted self-regulation, limiting  the number of vessels, fishing period and size of boats, but the  Japanese Government continued to protest at illegal activities  carried out by South Korean fishermen despite government  regulation.    Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa personally raised  the issue at a summit with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam  last November.    Seoul and Tokyo will need seven to eight more rounds of  talks  to settle the pending issues and plan to meet again sometime in  April.</p>

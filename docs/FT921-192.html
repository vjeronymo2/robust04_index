			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / German-style engineering doctorates FOUR-YEAR engineering doctorates, based on a German model and quite different from any existing postgraduate degree in the UK, are to be introduced at three British universities. The new degree, to be known as EngD, will combine academic research with project management, taught courses and problem-solving with an industrial sponsor. The Science and Engineering Research Council (Serc) announced yesterday that it would fund pilot EngD programmes at three centres, starting in October: the University of Manchester with Umist; University College, Swansea, with the University of Wales, Cardiff, and the North East Wales Institute; and Warwick University. Each centre will start with an annual intake of 10 research engineers a year and a Serc grant of Pounds 50,000 a year which will go up as student numbers increase. To encourage good students to apply, the EngD courses will pay a basic stipend of about Pounds 9,500 a year - more than twice the level of a standard postgraduate research grant. The EngD is modelled on the Dr Ing qualification introduced in Germany 60 years ago. Professor John Parnaby, chairman of the panel that recommended the move, said: 'Dr Ings are extremely well represented on the boards of successful German companies.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Johannesburg March 27 SAPA -- Any "disgruntled  nuclear and rocket scientist", who disclosed information about  South Africa's nuclear weapons programme, would be liable to  charges under legislation preventing the proliferation of  weapons of mass destruction, Armscor [Armaments Corporation of  South Africa] said in a statement on Sunday.    Armscor was responding to a Sunday newspaper report which  said nuclear scientists in a salary dispute with Armscor had  threatened to reveal as yet undisclosed information about South  Africa's past cooperation with Israel.    The report said the 16 scientists charged that they had been  promised two years' employment with local armament manufacturer  Denel, but were retrenched with only two months' notice.    Reacting to these allegations, Armscor said the 16 former  employees only had limited know-how of nuclear devices. Armscor  reaffirmed there was no international cooperation on the  development and manufacture of South Africa's nuclear devices.    The statement said Armscor also endorsed the principles of  the international non-proliferations bodies on not disclosing  information which could lead to the proliferation of nuclear  weapons.</p>

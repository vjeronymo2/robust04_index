			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / PLO financial crisis puts peace process in jeopardy THE financial crisis in the Palestine Liberation Organisation could jeopardise the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, Mr Ahmed Qurie (Abu Ala), the PLO economics chief, warned yesterday. Mr Qurie said the PLO had been unable to meet its operating expenses for the past five months, adding that the crisis has been absorbing the time of the PLO leadership at the expense of work on implementing the peace process. The strike at the PLO's Paris office during Mr Qurie's visit to the capital illustrates the organisation's financial paralysis. All inquiries about the visiting Palestinians were dealt with by the Israeli embassy. 'We are completely unable to face our commitments and obligations to our embassies, departments and the institutions like universities, trade unions and chambers of commerce which form the backbone of Palestinian social life,' Mr Qurie said. 'And the crisis comes as we are facing the challenge of creating new institutions for the peace. (Yassir) Arafat is finding its difficult to lead the peace process in a courageous way when he cannot even pay his bodyguards standing in the front of his office.' Mr Qurie said the minimum annual operating budget of the PLO before the peace agreement was Dollars 120m, but that the organisation was now virtually bankrupt. Donors had made promises but had not yet delivered aid for operating costs. Mr Qurie, 56, an Arafat loyalist who was the key Palestinian negotiator in the Oslo talks which produced the peace accord, said the PLO was determined to lay the embryonic economic framework for an independent Palestinian state. 'All the economic institutions will be the institutions of a sovereign state but we will be realistic about what is possible today, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow but the decisions of when to create the institutions will be ours and will be made on financial and economic grounds,' he said. Mr Qurie said the greatest challenge in the economic talks with Israel would be a trade agreement which respected the Palestinian integration in the Arab and Islamic world and particularly the PLO's intention to sign a free trade agreement and open borders with Jordan. Mr Qurie confirmed reports of a serious internal debate within the PLO over the shape of the institutions that will handle the transition to self-government in the occupied territories. The rift reportedly pits Mr Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), the man who signed the peace accord in Washington, and Mr Qurie against Mr Arafat who is reluctant to release his absolute control over all PLO institutions or admit new professional people who do not have a political background. 'Palestinians are now looking for clean institutions, more democracy,' he said. 'We are coming to a new stage with new responsibilities and it is normal that there will be different points of view. But it will be resolved in a democratic way within the PLO.' Mr Qurie is looking forward to returning to his home in Abu Dise, near East Jerusalem, which he last visited in 1968. But like many PLO exiles who have devoted most of their life to the bureaucratic work of the liberation movement he admits little personal feelings. 'I am like all Palestinians in exile who hope to go back to their land and live in peace, stability and democracy.'</p>

Meanwhile, Police Director General Police General Prathin  Santipraphop has issued an order dated June 3 for police to  intensively monitor people suspected to have links with  international terrorist groups and to tighten security for  embassies, certain schools, and other key establishments  following the arrest.    Six witnesses were brought one at a time for the  identification at Lumpini police station and all of them  independently singled out Hossein Shahriarifar from among seven  Middle Eastern men presented by police, said South Bangkok  Metropolitan Police Deputy Commander Police Colonel Dutsadi  Chaiyanam.    The seventh witness, the owner of the company from which the  truck used to carry the explosives was rented, did not  participate, saying he had not dealt directly with the man who  rented the vehicle, but let his employees handle the matter.  [passage omitted]    The taxi motorcyclist who was engaged in the road accident  that fortunately averted the planned sabotage yesterday  identified Shahriarfar as the driver of the truck which hit his  motorcycle, said Dutsadi.</p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Ex-banker aims to lift Tory funds The Conservative party has appointed a former investment banker as its new head of fundraising in a fresh attempt to cut its Pounds 15m overdraft by attracting more company donations. Mr Richard Warner, who until the early 1990s worked for Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, will have as one of his main responsibilities contacting company chairmen who have been reluctant to donate to the Tories. His appointment marks a break in tradition at Conservative Central Office since for the past 24 years this role has been undertaken by retired generals. One of Mr Warner's tasks will be to increase annual donations to the party from individuals and companies from Pounds 9.4m in 1993-94. It is believed that the Conservatives want this to increase to at least Pounds 20m by the time of the next general election, likely to be in about two years. Over this period the Tories want to cut the overdraft, which came about after high spending in the late 1980s and early 1990s, to about zero. In the past two years total donations - believed to be split roughly evenly between companies and individuals - have slipped. Several big companies have cut cash gifts either because of disillusionment with the effectiveness of donations, or because of reduced profits in the recession. Mr Warner, 55, said he wanted people to feel proud of giving money to the Tories. He took over last week from Maj Gen Stuart Watson. Mr Warner, a chemical engineer who first worked at Imperial Chemical Industries, worked for Morgan Grenfell for more than a decade. In his new job, he will liaise with the party's board of part-time treasurers, led by Lord Hambro, chairman of Hambros merchant bank.</p>

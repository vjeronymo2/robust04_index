			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Plan for Libya arms embargo THE US, Britain and France have agreed on a resolution imposing an air and arms embargo on Libya until it hands over suspects in the bombing of a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, and a French flight, diplomats said last night, AP reports from the UN. The draft resolution was expected to be circulated to the 15-member Security Council as early as today. Libyan leader Muammer Gadaffi said yesterday that four Libyan officials were willing to go to France to face charges of complicity in the 1989 bombing of a French UTA airliner over Niger that killed 170 people. But he said Libya would not honour the US and British request to hand over two other Libyans wanted in the Lockerbie bombing.</p>

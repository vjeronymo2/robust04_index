			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Albania invites overseas investment in sell-offs Albania, the former hardline communist country, will begin privatising its main state-owned utilities this autumn and wants the participation of foreign investors, the country's president, Doctor Sali Berisha, said yesterday. Dr Berisha suggested that the sell-offs would include the water, hydroelectric power generation, power distribution and telecommunication services. He said Albania was studying the privatisation experience of other countries - particularly the UK - to decide the best way of handling the sale. The main purpose of the exercise, Dr Berisha said, was not to maximise proceeds for the state but to achieve a rapid shift of ownership to the private sector. Albania has no stock exchange but the president said he was keen to set one up as soon as possible. His Democrat-led government, which came to power in the 1992 elections a year after the overthrow of communism, is pursuing wide-ranging reforms to introduce a market economy. These include new laws liberalising the ownership of land and natural assets. Although Albania has traditionally been hostile to foreign ownership of its assets, Dr Berisha said: 'The psychology of the people has changed' and foreign investment was now strongly welcomed, particularly in businesses which boosted export capability. Methods being considered for privatisation are auctions, sale of shares to private investors and sale of operating concessions. Dr Berisha said foreign investors would be encouraged to take part in the privatisation because Albania needed outside technology and capital. They would be treated on an equal footing with Albanian investors. He was speaking as Albania signed one of its most important foreign investment deals so far with Premier Consolidated Oilfields, the independent UK oil company. Under the agreement, which extends up to 25 years, Premier will work with Albpetrol, the state oil company, to develop Albania's southern oil region, which includes one of Europe's largest onshore oil fields at Patos Marinza. The initial investment by Premier will be Dollars 5m but this could rise as high as Dollars 70m, depending on the prospects. The work will be carried out by a new joint company, Anglo-Albanian Petroleum, which will receive 5 per cent of current oil production as a management fee. Any enhanced production will go to the company. AAP will also complete a 6,000 metre exploration well at Dumre to make one of Europe's deepest wells.</p>

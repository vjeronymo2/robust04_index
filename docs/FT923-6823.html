			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: WMI to buy 90.1% stake in Swedish group Waste Management International, the UK-quoted group, is to buy a majority stake in Sweden's state-owned hazardous waste company for SKr340m (Pounds 34m). The UK-based provider of waste and environmental services is acquiring 90.1 per cent of Svensk Avfallskonvertering (Sakab), which treats about 33,000 tons of hazardous waste per year. Mr Joe Holsten, WMI's vice-president of acquisitions, said: 'This is part of our strategy of increasing our ability of collecting and delivering hazardous waste. We are looking at further European acquisitions.' Waste Management International is part of Waste Management. The Chicago-based parent group sold 20 per cent of the UK company in a Pounds 405m global share offering in April. It said it would use the proceeds to exploit opportunities arising from tightening environmental regulations. In 1991 Sakab reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.35m on sales of Pounds 14.1m. It also has undeveloped permits for solvent distillation, solvent separation and pre-treatment of waste oils.</p>

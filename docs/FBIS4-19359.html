			<p>BFN     [Text] Oslo, April 15 (AFP) -- Norway is considering  sending a 400-man logistical battalion to Tuzla in response to a  formal request from the United Nations, the Foreign Ministry  said here Friday [15 April].    Norway already has a field hospital and helicopter wing  stationed in Tuzla as part of the joint Nordic force in the  region.    The Norwegian parliament must formally decide the matter,  although no date has been set yet. But it will take at least  several months before the troops are on site, a Defense Ministry  official said.    "We hope that the force can be assembled as quickly as  possible. Beyond that, it is impossible to provide a timeframe  for when the force will be on site," Norwegian Deputy Defense  Minister Sigve Brekke said.    The Defense Department does not consider it a major risk to  send new forces to Tuzla.    "There is no immediate danger to the safety of the Norwegian  contingent. That the Serbs are harassing the UN personnel  cannot prevent us from taking responsibility through  participation," Defense Minister Joergen Kosmo said.    "Unless something unexpected happens, the Norwegians are  pretty safe," Kosmo added.    Norway also intends to reduce the size of its peacekeeping  contigent in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia], where U.S. forces will be taking over, Defense  Ministry spokesman Chris Tredesen said.    There are currently 227 Norwegian soldiers in Macedonia as  part of the joint Nordic battalion.</p>

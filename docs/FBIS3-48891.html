Internationally, along with the end to the East-West Cold War,  the building of a new international order is becoming a pressing  issue. At home, the 1955 order centering on both the Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) and the Social Democratic Party of Japan  (SDPJ) has ended and an effective method is being sought to  proceed with foreign policy under a ruling coalition composed of  eight parties. The following is an introduction to the officials  that are proceeding with Japanese foreign policy under the most  difficult set of circumstances since the war.  <H5>  Minister and Parliamentary Vice Minister </H5>   On 1 August, MOFA carried out its greatest structural reform  since the war. The two pillars of structural reform were the  abolition of the United Nations Bureau along with the  establishment of the General Foreign Affairs Policy Bureau and a  change of the mantle for the Information Analysis, Research, and  Planning Bureau into the International Information Bureau. Along  with this, personnel changes were carried out on a ministry-wide  scale for the most part, including those overseas.    Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs  Tsutomu Hata is leading MOFA in this difficult situation. As the  head of the Shinseito Party, he contributed to the victory of  the non-LDP forces in the general election and the establishment  of a coalition administration centering on Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa. He personally denies it, but according to  those around him, it is said that he desired the appointment to  foreign minister at an early date and ultimately fulfilled his  desire.    He presents a slightly different foreign policy ideology  from  that of foreign ministers of the LDP regime era. For instance,  he advocates expressing general responsibility for World War II  and refraining from visits to Yasukuni Shrine on the 15 August  anniversary of the end of the war.    The parliamentary vice minister for foreign affairs, who  assists the foreign minister, is Shozo Azuma of the Komeito. It  is said that the appointment of the parliamentary vice minister  for foreign affairs from the Komeito was due to the strong  desire by that party and the desire was realized with the  appointment of Azuma. Ironically, his electoral district is the  Tokyo No. 6 District, the same area as former parliamentary vice  minister for foreign affairs, Koji Kakizawa, and it can be  called a personnel change due to an awareness of activities in  the era of Parliamentary Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs  Kakizawa.  <H3>  Administrative Vice Minister, Deputy Vice Minister for  Foreign Affairs, and Chief of Protocol </H3>   Supporting the two politicians, Tsutomu Hata and Shozo  Azuma,  are Administrative Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Kunihiko  Saito (passed foreign service exam in 1957, same for below) and  the following foreign service officers:    Saito, the administrative vice minister following previous  Vice Minister Hisashi Owada, has superior ability that was noted  early on in his career. He normally followed after Owada and  studied his foreign policy methods, as he was councilor for the  Treaties Bureau when Owada was director of that bureau and was  deputy vice minister for foreign affairs (in charge of political  affairs) when Owada was administrative vice minister for foreign  affairs.    However, Saito's foreign policy methods are a contrast to  Owada's. For example, Owada diligently looked over documents  himself and corrected them in ink in small letters. As opposed  to Owada who was not satisfied unless he participated in  everything himself, Saito is a rare type among recent senior  officials,who " leaves the work to subordinates but takes the  responsibility upon himself."    Naturally, Saito is popular among subordinates. In his days  as director of the Treaties Bureau, once Diet deliberations had  stopped as a result of his replies and when the evening came, he  left the office promptly. As might be expected, his subordiantes  were flustered at that. It is a fact that the sense of tension  in the ministry in the Owada era has dissolved with the  appointment of Saito, and the atmosphere has become animated.    There is obviously a lot of anxiety under a composite  administration, but he does not seem perturbed, saying "The  continuation of foreign policy is included in the consensus of  the eight parties, and I am not worried at all. I am confident  that policy decisions will be made so as not to lose  opportunities."    Following No. 1 Saito on the administrative side are the two  No. 2 deputy vice ministers for foreign affairs, Hiroshi Fukuda  (1959) and Koichiro Matsuura (1958). Fukuda is in charge of  political affairs, and Matsuura is in charge of economic  affairs. These two are called "vice minister class."    After serving as private secretary to Prime Minister  Yasuhiro  Nakasone (at the time) and director of the Treaties Bureau,  Fukuda served abroad as ambassador to Malaysia for about two  years and nine months.    The major jobs for the deputy vice minister for foreign  affairs in charge of political affairs are consulting with the  vice minister class of major countries and preparing discussions  on political issues at summits. His schedule is rather hard and  among senior councilors, for example, some are forced to retire  from overwork due to consecutive trips abroad.    Experience as a private secretary to the prime minister and  director of the Treaties Bureau is useful in the administrative  work of a deputy vice minister for foreign affairs, but  nevertheless, a hiatus of two years and nine months is big.  Therefore, he currently is receiving discourses on each topic  from administrative authorities. For the present, it seems that  preparations for the Japan visit by Russian President Yeltsin,  scheduled for the middle of October, will be the test case.    Matsuura scored further points by shepherding the success of  the Tokyo Summit in July. After enjoying hiking in the Northern  and Southern Alps on a brief summer vacation, he will undertake  U.S.-Japancomprehensive economic talks from September on. With  this as his final job, he will be transferred to an  ambassadorship in the European area at the end of 1993 or the  beginning of 1994.    The chief of protocol, Junichi Nakamura (1957), also will be  transferred to an ambassadorship after the Europe visit of the  emperor and empress in September. It has been informally decided  that his successor will be Makoto Watanabe (1958), director of  the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).    The private secretary to the minister of foreign affairs is  Yoichi Nishizawa, who is young, but enjoys confidence of Hata..  Lately, there is the trend in MOFA for the minister's secretary  for political affairs to become the private secretary to the  minister of foreign affairs.    Kaoru Ishikawa (1971) substantially serves as private  secretary in handling the private secretary administrative work  of the foreign minister. He was appointed from the position of  chief of the First West Europe Division, and there had been a  move for his appointment in the era of the previous Foreign  Minister Kabun Muto. However, just when he had begun making his  rounds of greetings, the former appointee was retained in his  post by the voice of authority of former Foreign Minister Michio  Watanabe. He was thoroughly prepared for his appearance this  time. He is a second-generation foreign service officer  following his father who served as ambassador to Kuwait. He  resembles his father in both spoken and written eloquence.    Another person who handles the private secretary  administrative work of the foreign minister is Kazuhiro Fujimura  (1982), a young foreign service hopeful with a promising future.    Next, let's look at the new major foreign affairs lineup  after the August personnel changes by bureau.  <H5>  Minister's Secretariat </H5>   The director of the Secretariat is Sadayuki Hayashi (1959).  He had the strong trust of the previous vice minister, Owada,  and will be promoted to deputy vice minister for foreign affairs  in charge of economic affairs, the successor to Matsuura, at the  end of 1993 or the beginning of 1994. It is said to be "a  parting present personnel change" by Owada. Since he has a  sincere personality and is the type who carries out instructions  silently, he is highly rated by superiors.    Saito also cited "Hayashi's remaining in his post for at  least a half year" as a condition for accepting the vice  ministership.    The press secretary, who is the spokesman for MOFA, is  Kisuke  Terada (1961). He was appointed from the position of director of  the Central and South American Affairs Bureau, and because of  his experience as private secretary to Prime Minister Noboru  Takeshita, chief of the Press Division, and councilor in charge  of the press and public relations, he has many acquaintances  among the press-related people at home and abroad. He is perhaps  the most suitable person for the position.    His ambition is modestly "not to have misreadings by  press-related people," but he knows the vital points of the job.    Incidentally, Terada is an expert in Spanish. He even has  the ability to serve as an interpreter for heads of state  conferences. Moreover, he is also skillful respectively in  English, which every foreign service officer can speak, and in  French due to his wife's being French. The press secretary for  foreign affairs has a news conference with foreign special  correspondents in Tokyo twice a week in the news conference room  on the third floor of MOFA, and the birth of a press secretary  proficient in languages has been favorably received by foreign  reporters.    The general councilor in charge of the Diet is Atsushi  Hatanaka (1964). It seems that there is considerable confusion  on Diet measures because the LDP has become an opposition  party, a "strong opposition party" has appeared, the ruling  party is a coalition of eight parties, and the SDPJ, which had  been far from the government foreign affairs, security, and  defense policies up to now, has become a party in power.    The councilor in charge of the press and public relations is  Sadaaki Numata (1965). He is an expert in English and previously  served as an interpreter at U.S.-Japan summit conferences. Like  Terada, foreign special correspondents in Tokyo have come to  rely on him.    The chiefs of the major divisions in the Minister's  Secretariat are Rokuzen Nishimura (1966), chief of the General  Affairs Division; Shotaro Taniuchi (1968), chief of the  Personnel Division; and Ichiro Fujisaki (1968), chief of the  Financial Affairs Division.    Among them, Nishimura is a foreign service officer who  joined  MOFA from Sophia University and was appointed chief of the  General Affairs Division after serving as chief of the Press  Division and counselor for the Information Analysis, Research,  and Planning Bureau. At MOFA, the chief of the General Affairs  Division, Minister's Secretariat, is a "pivotal" post in charge  of coordination with the prime minister's official residence and  the various ministries and agencies. There will be many  instances when he is appointed to a bureau director position in  the future.    In his days as counselor for the Information Analysis,  Research, and Planning Bureau, Nishimura achieved results by  undertaking, without sleep or rest, the problem of fund  cooperation ($13 billion) for realizing peace and security in  the Gulf region. Japan went so far as to increase taxes to  implement the fund. He has become the personal adviser on  foreign affairs for the prime minister due to school ties with  Prime Minister Hosokawa.    It has been a characteristic of Nishimura that in  undertaking  foreign policy problems, he has tried to make a fresh approach  that is different from ordinary foreign service officers'  approaches.    Insofar as Taniuchi served as a private secretary in the  days  when Nobuo Matsunaga was administrative vice minister for  foreign affairs, he is an affable person and also does his work  well. Having passed the foreign service test in 1968, he  probably is a future candidate for vice minister, along with  Hitoshi Tanaka mentioned later (chief of the General Affairs  Division, General Foreign Policy Bureau).    Fujisaki is the son of Kazusato Fujisaki, former director of  the MOFA Treaties Bureau, who served as a supreme court justice.  There are many second-generation foreign service officers within  MOFA.    Chikahito Harada (1973), who became chief of the Press  Division in the August personnel changes, was a selection that  upset the expectations of many people. Previously, a senior  foreign service officer of the division chief class has been  appointed the chief of the Press Division. Since Harada, the  youngest of the division chiefs, was appointed, those within  MOFA were surprised.    Before returning as chief of the Status of U.S. Forces  Agreement Division of the North American Affairs Bureau at the  MOFA, Harada served as secretary in charge of public relations  at the Japanese Embassy in Russia and was popular among the  Japanese press corp in Moscow.    In his days as chief of the Status of U.S. Forces Agreement  Division, he sought understanding and cooperation in the  maintenance of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty while exchanging  drinks with the mayors of cities, towns, and villages embracing  U.S. military bases throughout Japan. He was familiar with "the  scene,"a rare attribute for a foreign service officer. This  record of performance was seen in his appointment to chief of  the Press Division, which taxes one's nerves due to the  association with press-related people.    Harada's language of expertise is Russian. The Japan visit  of  President Yeltsin in October probably will be the first  opportunity to show his skill.  <H5>  General Foreign Policy Bureau </H5>   The August structural reform was inaugurated with a flourish  of trumpets. MOFA has been a vertical administration with the  Asian Affairs Bureau, North American Affairs Bureau, and  European and Oceanic Affairs Bureau, but the reason this bureau  has been established is to deal with international situations  that are rife with fluidity, by developing horizontal,  comprehensive foreign policy.    Behind this is the reflection that vertical administration  was a disaster and a swift response was impossible at the time  of the 1990 Gulf war.    The first director of the bureau is Shunji Yanai (1960), who  served as the first director general of the International Peace  Cooperation Headquarters in the era of the previous Miyazawa  administration. This bureau created the draft of the foreign  policy portion of the general policy speech delivered by Prime  Minister Hosokawa in the special session of the Diet. This  bureau also was in charge of the policy of taking general  responsibility for World War II that has been advocated by  Foreign Minister Hata. Furthermore, this bureau has begun to  make the draft for Prime Minister Hosokawa's general discussion  speech at the ordinary general session of the United Nations.    Novel ideas, in addition to ample knowledge of internationl  law, are sought in the officers of the bureau, but the best  fitted was Yanai who served as director of the Treaties Bureau  and was concerned with the first full-scale UN peacekeeping  operation [PKO] for Japan.    Yanai looks back on his year as director general of the  International Peace Cooperation Headquarters as "having  continuous application to everday problems." His hobby is being  a Sunday carpenter and he apparently makes furniture.    Councilor Yoshikazu Nogami (1965) was known internationally  for his activities in the multinational conference on peace in  the Middle East during his previous job when he was councilor  for the Middle Eastern and African Affairs Bureau. He is viewed  as a talent most appropriately appointed to the General Foreign  Policy Bureau (at MOFA abbreviated and called Soseikyoku) where  new ideas are needed.    The major division chiefs are the aforementioned Hitoshi  Tanaka (1968), chief of the General Affairs Division; Yoichi  Otabe (1973), chief of the Planning Division; Sumio Tarui  (1970), chief of the Security Policy Division; and Mototake  Yoshikawa (1973), chief of the UN Policy Division.    Tanaka is "an able man" who served in the past as the senior  administrative official of the First North America Division and  chief of the Second North America Division. There is the feeling  that MOFA heads chose talented men such as Yanai, Nogami, and  Tanaka to produce results in this new bureau.  <H5>  Asian Affairs Bureau </H5>   It was traditionally the most rightwing bureau before the  inauguration of the General Foreign Policy Bureau, but it has  yielded that position with the birth of the General Foreign  Policy Bureau.    The bureau director is Tadashi Ikeda (1961), an expert on  China. Since the time of his appointment, it has been said that  he was appointed so that the historical visit to China by the  emperor and empress could end successfully. The China visit of  both their majesties ended without incident as expected and his  popularity within MOFA quickly rose. Some call for him to be the  next director of the Secretariat disregarding Yukio Sato,  director of the North American Affairs Bureau, who is highly  recommended by some to be the next director of the Secretariat.    During his days as a minister in Thailand, he had contacts  with officers of the Pol Pot faction in the jungle near the  Cambodian border. He has increased his fans in MOFA by his  sincere courtesy without the unapproachableness that is apt to  exist in foreign service officers.    The councilor is Yukio Takeuchi (1966) who served as private  secretary to Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa (at the time). The  counselor is Akimoto Takano (1966) who served in the handling  of the private secretary administrative work for Foreign  Minister Shintaro Abe (at the time, now deceased).    The division chiefs are Seiji Kojima (1971), chief of the  Regional Policy Division; Shigeru Nakamura (1972), chief of the  Northeast Asia Division; Yoshio Nomoto (1971), chief of the  China Division; Tadamichi Yamamoto (1973), chief of the First  Southeast Asia Division; Keiichi Hayashi (1973), chief of the  Second Southeast Asia Division; and Yasuaki Tanizaki (1974),  chief of the Southwest Asia Division.    Among these, Nomoto was appointed from his position as chief  of the General Affairs Department (Taipei) of the Exchange  Association with Taiwan. In the previous MOFA personnel changes,  it would not have been considered because of concern for China,  and it can be called a sign that Japan's foreign policy on China  has changed from "outward formality" to "inward feelings."    Yamamoto's outstanding English capability and superior  diplomatic abilities that were demonstrated in the series of  Cambodian problems have received a high rating inside and  outside MOFA.  <H5>  North American Affairs Bureau </H5>   The bureau director is Yukio Sato (1960), the ablest man in  MOFA. The prospects are that he will be promoted to director of  the Secretariat at the end of 1993 or the beginning of 1994.    At MOFA, the Economic Affairs Bureau stands at the front  line  in the economic area of U.S.-Japan relations, but Sato directed  talk preparations for the opening of the first talks between the  U.S. and Japanese heads of state for the Hosokawa administration  in New York in the latter part of September.    The councilor is Ryozo Kato (1964), and the chiefs of the  major divisions are Toshiaki Ozawa (1972), chief of the First  North America Division, and Shinichi Nishimiya (1975), chief of  the Second North America Division. Kato is a future candidate  for vice minister.  <H5>  Central and South American Affairs Bureau </H5>   The bureau director is Kiyohiko Arafune (1961), who was  called back from his position as ambassador to Nicaragua to  replace Terada, who became press secretary. He has had a broad  range of work and friendly relationships, being temporarily  transferred to the Finance Ministry and serving as head of the  Nagoya Customshouse, and it seems to have become a plus in his  career as a foreign service officer afterward.    The counselor is Shinya Nagai (1967), and the chiefs of the  major divisions are Akira Miwa (1974), chief of the First  Central and South America Division which covers South America,  and Masuo Nishibayashi (1974), chief of the Second Central and  South America Division which is in charge of Central America and  part of South America.  <H5>  European and Oceanic Affairs Bureau </H5>   The bureau director is Issei Nomura (1962), an expert on  Russia. It seems his ability will be evaluated by whether or  not he will be able to make the official visit to Japan by  Russian President Yeltsin in the middle of October the first  step in the resolution of the pending northern territories  problem.    The councilor is Shigeru Tsumori (1964), and a major  division  chief is Tsuneo Nishida (1969) who transferred to the Russian  Division from chief of the Press Division. Nishida is an expert  in English and it is unusual to appoint a chief of the Russian  Division who does not speak Russian. There is a strong view that  it is an expression of MOFA's desire to handle foreign policy on  Russia using a new concept.    Yasuo Saito (1970), who handled private secretary  administrative work for the previous foreign minister, is the  chief of the First West Europe Division which is in charge of  France and Germany, etc., and Akitaka Saiki (1975) is the chief  of the Second West Europe Division which is in charge of Great  Britain, etc. Saiki is known as a "forceful foreign service  officer."  <H5>  Middle Eastern and African Affairs Bureau </H5>   The bureau director is Takaya Sudo (1961), an Arabist.  Although he was appointed after serving as councilor for science  and technology, he should be quite satisfied with the  appointment as an expert. For the time being, the big job will  be preparations for the "Africa Development Conference" to be  held under the sponsorship of the Japanese Government in Tokyo  in October.    The counselor is Toshinori Shigeie (1968) who returned to  the  home ministry after serving as a minister to the United  Nations. The chiefs of the divisions are Hideo Tanaka (1970),  chief of the First Middle East Division which has jurisdiction  over Egypt and Israel, etc.; Toshihiro Okuda (1974), chief of  the Second Middle East Division which is in charge of the Gulf  nations such as Saudi Arabia; Kensuke Tsuzuki (1974), chief of  the First Africa Division; and Hisao Yamaguchi (1974), chief of  the Second Africa Division.    Shigeie, who has had experience as chief of the Security  Division, North American Affairs Bureau, etc., is greatly  trusted by high-ranking officials, but it seems that his actions  will be the key to deciding the value of the bureau.  <H5>  Economic Affairs Bureau </H5>   The bureau director, Kazuo Ogura (1961), along with  classmate  Minoru Tanba (director of the Treaties Bureau), is an elite  foreign service officer. of whom it was said from early on,  "Ogura or Tanba will become administrative vice minister for  foreign affairs." He has both written and spoken eloquence and  the articles that he contributes once in a while to the  "Foreign Affairs Forum," the public relations magazine of MOFA,  almost always are popular inside and outside the ministry.    The councilors who assist Ogura are Kazuo Asaumi (1961) and  Nobuyasu Abe (1966). Asaumi is the son of former Ambassador to  the U.S. Koichiro Asaumi, and formerly served as interpreter for  U.S.-Japan heads-of-state talks. Abe worked hard and rendered  distinguished service behind the scenes in the economic area for  the success of the Tokyo summit in July.    The general affairs counselor, who also can be called the  director of the Secretariat for the Economic Affairs Bureau, is  Yoshiki Mine (1967). The chiefs of the divisions are Kojiro  Shiojiri (1972), chief of the First International Economic  Affairs Division which is in charge of trade with the European  Community (EC) and economic integration, and Koro Bessho (1974),  chief of the Second International Economic Affairs Division in  charge of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). The  other division chiefs are a galaxy of able men.    Japan took the lead role at the Tokyo summit, and it was  agreed to conclude successfully the Uruguay Round (new  multilateral trade negotiations) within the year, but it will be  a test case of the Economic Affairs Bureau whether or not this  can be realized.  <H5>  Economic Cooperation Bureau </H5>   Hiroshi Hirabayashi (1962) was appointed bureau director  after serving as a minister to the United States in the August  personnel changes. He immediately displayed his skill in the  Cambodian postwar reconstruction problem, etc. In his days as  minister to the United States, he appeared on U.S. television,  etc., and as a result of his blunt speeches that were  disagreeable to U.S. ears, it seems that he was kept at a  distance. When he believes it to be true, he speaks out  without reserve. From the standpoint of a friend, there is no  person with such dependable fighting power.    The councilor is Shohei Naito (1965). During the Gulf war,  Japanese in Kuwait became hostages of Iraq and he worked hard  without sleep or rest for their release. The counselor is  Hideaki Ueda (1966). Originally, he was in Russian service, and  economic cooperation has been a different field, but he has been  cheerfully carrying out his work, including trips to Central  Asia, ever since his appointment.    For the chiefs of the major divisions, Nobuichi Kitajima  (1970) is the chief of the Planning Division, which can be  called the secretariat of the Economic Cooperation Bureau. He is  one of the few foreign service officers in MOFA who came from  Keio University, but he has melded into the ministry so well  that officers in the ministry who do not know from what  university he came are surprised and say, "Did he come from Keio  University?" In the days of his former job as chief of the First  International Organizations Division of the Economic Affairs  Bureau, he worked hard on arrangements for the Uruguay Round and  was deeply trusted by Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe (at the  time).    The chief of the Technical Cooperation Division is Mitsuo  Sakaba (1972). Due to joining the ministry from Yokohama City  University, it seems that human relations were difficult for him  at first. However, he is deeply trusted by his subordinates for  his quiet and refined style of work. In addition, Shigekazu Sato  (1973) is chief of the Loan Aid Division and Masahito Kodera  (1975) is chief of the Grant Aid Division. On the occasion of  the visit to China by the emperor and empress, Kodera  contributed to its success by working devotedly behind the  scenes as senior administrative officer of the China Division in  the Asian Affairs Bureau.  <H5>  Treaties Bureau </H5>   The bureau director is Minoru Tanba (1961). The director of  the Treaties Bureau has important jobs such as responding in the  Budget Committees of both the House of Councilors and the House  of Representatives and attending conferences with Russia, with  whom a peace treaty has not been concluded.    Tanba is extremely popular with the LDP opposition party and  therefore it looks like that he need not to worry about being  bullied by "the strongest opposition party in history."    He is an expert on Russia and previously has been known as a  hardliner on Russian policy, but recently, he has a touch of  consideration for the U.S. and European position of support for  Yeltsin and much more flexible.    The councilor is Hiroharu Koike (1965), who is working at  the home ministry for the first time in a long time, after  serving as a minister of the Japanese Government mission at the  United Nations.    The lineup of division chiefs are Ichiro Komatsu (1971),  chief of the Treaties Division; Kenjiro Moji (1974), chief of  the International Conventions Division; and Tetsuo Ito (1972),  chief of the Legal Affairs Division.  <H5>  International Information Bureau </H5>   The bureau director is Haruhiko Shibuya (1962). He slid over  horizontally from the position of director of the United Nations  Bureau, which was abolished along with the inauguration of the  General Foreign Policy Bureau.    Previously, as councilor of the Asian Affairs Bureau at the  time when the crew of the Fujiyama Maru No. 18 was released by  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), he  traveled together with Ichiro Ozawa (currently acting secretary  general of the Shinseito) to take charge of the crewmembers in  Pyongyang. When the special plane landed at Haneda, the  television [broadcast] that was relayed showed Shibuya who was  mistaken for a released crewmember.    He has many fans at MOFA with his polite manner and honest  personality that are not common in a foreign service officer.    The councilor is Kiyohiko Nanao (1965). It previously seemed  that his specialty field was economic foreign policy, but since  serving as a minister to South Korea, he also has become strong  in the political field.    The division chiefs are Makoto Mizutani (1970), chief of the  International Information Division; Akio Suda (1970), chief of  the First Analysis Division; and Hiroyuki Kishino (1974), chief  of the Second Analysis Division.  <H5>  Other </H5>   The chief of the Cultural Affairs Department is Takayuki  Kimura (1961). The weight occupied by cultural exchange in  Japanese foreign affairs has been increasing year by year, but  actual results steadily have been produced in diverse fields  such as Japanese language education abroad, cooperation for  Japanese research, introduction of Japanese culture abroad, and  cooperation in the preservation of cultural heritage.    Assisting Kimura and substantially working on cultural  foreign policy are the three, Councilor Takashi Nakamoto (1965),  Osamu Shiozaki (1972), chief of the First Cultural Affairs  Division, and Nobutaka Shinomiya (1973), chief of the Second  Cultural Affairs Division.    Nakamoto has served as private secretary to director of the  Secretariat, Takao Fujinami (at the time) and is one of the  hopeful leading foreign service officers with expectations for  the future.    Appreciation for the existence of the Consular and  Emigration  Affairs Department is increasing more and more along with  Japanese living and traveling abroad. There also should be some  people among the general public who have been assisted by the  department once or twice.    Chief of the department is Yoshihisa Ara (1961) and the  counselor is Norio Hattori (1967). Previously at the time when  there were many hijacking incidents by the Japanese Red Army,  the counselor of the Consular and Emigration Affairs Department  was appointed under careful instruction beforehand about the  possibility of being exchanged for hostages.    Speaking of that, Ryohei Murata, the current ambassador to  Germany, had experience in that post. He remembers the episode  on the occasion of the Kuala Lumpur incident when he was  exchanged for hostages and passed the time by solving crossword  puzzles in the aircraft together with the enemy, the Japanese  Red Army.    In the same department is the Foreign Nationals Affairs  Division whose workload has expanded in both quality and  quantity with the rapid increase of foreigners coming into Japan  recently. The experts from Division Chief Akio Egawa (1974) and  on down are tackling the surge of visa applications.    An organization that is substantially the same as a  department is the Arms Control and Scientific Affairs Councilor  Organization. The head is Akira Hayashi (1963), and the  counselor is Yoshitaka Kawamura (1967) who was transferred from  the Asian Affairs Bureau.    There are two divisions and two offices in the organization.  The chief of the Arms Control and Disarmament Division is  Takeshi Nakane (1973), and the chief of the Scientific Affairs  and Nuclear Energy Division is Yukihisa Amano (1971). Waiting  for Nakane is the issue of creating the draft for the nuclear  test ban treaty, etc.    Chief of the International Social Cooperation Department is  Kojiro Takano (1963). In his days as chief of the General  Affairs Division of the Japan International Cooperation Agency  (JICA), he directly faced the incident of the murder of a JICA  expert by antigovernment guerrillas in Peru, and his memories of  skillfully dealing with the difficult problem are fresh.    In his new post, he handles highly contemporary problems  such  as UN administration and finance, human rights, refugees, drugs,  and wildlife protection. It probably should be viewed as facing  a chance to make further strides.    The counselor is Itaru Umezu (1967), who has had experience  as the consul in New York. For division chiefs, Yuji Kumamaru  (1974) is chief of the United Nations Administration Division  and originally was an expert on China. Chief of the Human Rights  and Refugee Division is Toshio Kunikata (1975), and chief of the  Global Scale Problems Division is Toshiki Kanamori. Kanamori is  a temporary transfer from the Finance Ministry. His proficient  language capability gives him the advantage.    In addition, the councilor in charge of inspection is Takao  Kawakami (1960). He is the former director of the Economic  Cooperation Bureau, but the opinion is strong that he will be  appointed chief of the Cabinet Foreign Policy Councilors'  Office some day.    The ambassador in charge of international trade is Nobutoshi  Akao (1960). He bears the heavy responsibility for reaching an  agreement within the year in the Uruguay Round.    The ambassador in charge of negotiations on normalizing  relations between Japan and North Korea is Tetsuya Endo (1957).  He is a classmate of Vice Minister Saito and also is in charge  of Asian Pacific cooperation. Japan-North Korea negotiations  never have been held since Endo became in charge of them,  and it is not certain whether or not he will be able to put a  period to the last postwar disposition of Japan. In so far as  North Korea has been awkward as a negotiation partner, it seems  that he has faced his crucial moment as a foreign service  officer.    As director of the Foreign Service Training Institute,  Shintaro Yamashita (1957) is in charge of training young foreign  service officers. As general guidance officer, Yuji Miyamoto  (1968) helps Yamashita.    Among the foreign service officers temporarily transferred  to  other ministries or agencies, Sakutaro Tanino (1959) is the  chief of the Cabinet Councilors' Office on External Affairs. He  is an expert on China, has obtained overwhelming support from  the China school within the ministry, and many have anticipated  that he will be appointed deputy vice minister for foreign  affairs after Saito is promoted to vice minister.    Hisami Kurokochi (1957), who is known as the oldest forceful  foreign officer, serves as the chief of the House of  Representatives Committee on the Foreign Affairs Research Office.    The second secretary general of the International Peace  Cooperation Headquarters is Katsunari Suzuki (1961), the  previous director of the Information Analysis, Research, and  Planning Bureau. He immediately made an inspection tour of the  scene in Cambodia. Yoshiyuki Sadaoka (1973) is the counselor for  the International Peace Cooperation Headquarters and supports  Suzuki.    In addition, Kazuyuki Hiraoka (1953) is the director of the  state guest house, Kiyoshi Kadotani (1948) is the lord  chamberlain of the household, Azusa Hayashi (1968) is chief of  Police Headquarters, Iwate Prefecture, and Masaji Takahashi  (1960) is director of the Immigration Bureau, Ministry of  Justice.    The president of JICA is Kensuke Yanagiya (1948). He is  famous for taking a part in the nuptials of the Crown Prince and  Masako. JICA director Makoto Watanabe (1958) soon will return to  the home ministry and is scheduled to be appointed the post of  Chief of Protocol.    Also from MOFA are Shinichiro Asao (1950), director of the  Japan Foundation, and Toshijiro Nakashima (1948), Supreme Court  justice.  <H5>  Overseas Establishments </H5>   Finally, let's mention the major ambassadors among the  foreign service officers who are serving in overseas  establishments.    In the Asia Pacific region, Toshio Goto (1953) is in South  Korea, and Michihiko Kunihiro (1954) is in China. Goto has been  a consul in South Korea in the past, has served as director of  the Asian Affairs Bureau, and is most suitable as ambassador to  South Korea.    Kimio Fujita in Indonesia and Hiroaki Fujii in Thailand both  passed the foreign service officer exam in 1955, and are fellow  rivals. Along with Koji Watanabe, ambassador to Italy in the  same 1955 group, they are called the triumvirate of vice  minister candidates. In Australia Kazutoshi Hasegawa (1956) who  served as private secretary to Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone  (at the time).    In the North American region, Takakazu Kuriyama (1953) is in  the United States. It was rumored that Hisashi Owada, previous  administrative vice minister for foreign affairs, would be  appointed ambassador to the United States and it seems that  Kuriyama has difficulty doing the job, but he will continue  until at least the end of 1994. Noboru Nakahira (1953) is in  Canada. In his previous appointment, he served as ambassador in  charge of Japan-North Korea negotiations.    Turning an eye to the European region, Sumio Edamura (1951)  is in Russia. He will retire after the visit to Japan by  President Yeltsin in October and Koji Watanabe will take his  place. Hiroshi Kitamura (1952) is in Great Britain, Atsuhiko  Yatabe (1951) is in France, and Ryohei Murata (1951) is in  Germany.    In the Middle East and African region, Taizo Watanabe (1956)  is in Egypt, Hiroshi Ota (1959) is in Saudi Arabia, and Takeshi  Ohara (1960) is in Iran.    In charge of international agencies, Yoshio Hatano (1952) is  at the United Nations, Yoshitomo Tanaka (1955) is at the  Disarmament Conference, and Yoshiyasu Sato (1957) is at the  Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. Sato is  from Hitotsubashi University. He is strongly trusted by his  schoolmate, former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, and if  Foreign Minister Watanabe had continued on, it is said that he  would have been appointed vice minister instead of Saito.    Among these ambassadors, Kitamura and Hatano are scheduled  to  be replaced in the near future, and the personnel changes for  successors probably will be a topic of conversation.</p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> HARVESTS HEALTHY AT COMMUNITY GARDEN  </P> <P> Just yards from busy, six-lane Telephone Road in east Ventura, nestled next to  a barranca and tucked in behind brick walls, lies a peaceful, verdant tribute  to Mother Nature and cooperative gardening.  </P> <P> It's the city of Ventura's Cornucopia Community Garden, a two-acre parcel  situated on an Edison Co. easement just east of Johnson Drive.  </P> <P> For $40 for six months, gardeners can lease an 18- by 25-foot plot, either  organic or non-organic. The fee covers trash and water service, the use of some  tools, as well as a monthly gardening newsletter published by the city's  recreation department, regular meetings featuring guest speakers, and an artful  gardening manual full of tips and advice.  </P> <P> Robert Barnum, 61, of Ventura rents two adjacent organic plots. A veteran  junior high school band leader, Barnum signed up for his gardens in November  after a long-awaited retirement trip with his wife.  </P> <P> His plots are two of the more productive in the garden, with peas, onions,  beans and carrots sharing space with corn, potatoes and lettuce.  </P> <P> "We've been eating broccoli like mad," Barnum said on a recent afternoon as he  surveyed his efforts. "I've been giving away cabbage, and we have enough  spinach to freeze."  </P> <P> He attributes his garden's success to his daily visits to weed, water and  harvest, and he reaps rewards beyond the bounty of the fresh vegetables that he  takes home.  </P> <P> "My health has always been good," he said, "but it's better now because of  gardening. I have a passion for it. I almost think I would've been better off  as an organic farmer instead of a music teacher."  </P> <P> Ray Hendricks, 60, makes a regular commute from Channel Islands Harbor, where  he lives on his sailboat, to care for his plants.  </P> <P> Indeed, the community garden seems to be a haven for condominium and apartment  dwellers who have precious little room for a garden.  </P> <P> "I like it here," Hendricks said while taking a break from turning over soil  with a spade. "I like the sun, and my co-workers enjoy the tomatoes I bring in.  </P> <P> "And it's nice to sweat once in a while," he added.  </P> <P> As for watering the gardens in a city where a rationing program is soon to  begin, recreation Supervisor Beth Cohen said no one has determined how to  reduce the amount of water used by the gardeners by the mandated 20%.  </P> <P> "We might end up cutting back on the number of plots we rent, or asking people  to voluntarily cut back on the amount of water they use," she said. "But I  don't think there are many drought-tolerant vegetables."  </P> <P> Water problems notwithstanding, the city expects to rent nearly all of the  plots this spring. Of the 69 available in the northern section, nearly half are  taken. KAREN McKEAN  </P></p>

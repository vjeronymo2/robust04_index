			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Peter de Graaf and Wio Joustra: "Netherlands and </F> Belgian Navies To Integrate"]    [Excerpts] The Hague/Brussels -- The Navies of the  Netherlands and Belgium are going to strengthen their  cooperation. In the near future, there will be talk of an all  but complete operational integration of the most important  surface ships of the two navies.    The frigates and minehunters of both countries will then, in  practice, comprise a single navy, although control of the ships  will remain in national hands. The command center for the joint  fleet will be in Den Helder, manned by military personnel from  both countries. [passage omitted]    In The Hague there was talk Tuesday [26 April] that this was  similar to the German-Netherlands Army Corps to be set up in  Muenster. This corps will comprise two German divisions and one  Netherlands division. The difference is that the  German-Netherlands Corps will be under a revolving command. The  Netherlands Navy commander will continue to be the primary  person responsible for the joint navy with Belgium. [passage  omitted]    The cooperation is designed mainly to produce military  budget  savings. The Netherlands Navy will have to reduce its personnel  nearly 30 percent by the year 2000. With a total budget  reduction of 18 percent since 1989 and considering that the  Navy's budget accounts for some 20 percent of the overall  defense budget, it is clear that there have been major savings  in this branch of the Armed Forces over the past five years.</p>

The communique, reported by Otavio Mulembe, Voice of  the Resistance of the Black Cockerel journalist, says that the  Luanda government has used SU-25 aircraft to bomb the area,  killing three people -- two children and a woman. Dozens  civilians were seriously affected by gases coming from the  explosion.    The communique also reveals that People's Armed Forces for  the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] personnel, estimated at four  infantry brigades and one motorized brigade, have begun yet  another offensive to capture the city of Uige. The document  says there are two groups, one moving along the right bank of  Benge River through Nambuangongo, and the second is following  the left bank of Benge River, passing through Ndalatando and  Ucua with the intention of going to Uige. The patriotic and  revolutionary FALA military command in the area alerts the  international community and the United Nations to the danger  such adventure may represent to Angola, and particularly to its  negotiating process.    The communique stresses that FALA is ready to adhere  scrupulously to the unilateral cease-fire, but will never accept  provocations, wherever they come from. It appeals to the  residents to remain vigilant and calm, because FALA knows how to  defend the people.</p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Jobs: Plan to make executive moves safer - Enterprising insurance man developing policy to cover against risks of changing employers TO judge by the times the same disaster is reported by readers, it is a serious risk to any executive job-changer. Take for instance the finance manager who generously wishes the offending outfit as well as himself to remain anonymous. Rather than move out of London with his existing employer in 1989, he decided to take advantage of the still active executive market and change companies. Soon he was signed up as group accountant at the headquarters of an international group. Whereupon, he says: 'There were two surprises awaiting me on the day I started the job. Firstly, two thirds of it were being done by someone else who was due to retire at the end of nine months. Secondly, there was no desk to spare in the whole office and one had to be bought. This arrived after two months during which I had use of a small table between two secretaries. I rode out these difficulties without making any issue of them. 'However it became apparent as time went on that I had been misled, and after five months I felt compelled to raise the matter with my superior . . . .' The upshot, as so often, was that he was asked to resign, which he did only to find the market cold. And although the group paid for counselling, he's still jobless. 'I would not wish these experiences on anybody,' he adds, 'except possibly those who bestowed them upon me' Amen to that] But while I know of many other cases where the employer looks to be solely at fault, in most the responsibility is less clear. Some were the result of sudden insolvency which was as much a surprise to the firm's recruiters as to the recruit. In others, usually attributed to 'irreconcilable differences', the blame is presumably shared. A knock-on effect is that awareness of such disasters deters underused talents from moving, especially in a recession. Hence the risk plays a part, albeit minor, in inhibiting recovery. So what - except murmuring 'Goodness, how sad' - is anyone doing about it? Well, one who's trying is Peter Bedford of Fenchurch Insurance Brokers, thanks to an initiative by headhunter John Courtis. In league with an underwriter at Lloyd's of London, Mr Bedford is evolving an insurance policy covering the dangers described. True, individuals can thrash out their own protection with intending employers, he says. But that usually entails nit-picking by lawyers for each side, consuming time as well as money creamed off by the legal fat cats. By contrast, the 'executive recruit's guarantee option' would have a standard form. Employers who offered it, either freely or on demand by a chosen candidate, would pay a premium covering up to two years salary or so. The current idea is a premium of 2 per cent of salary times years of contract for each of three types of risk: redundancy, insolvency and the aforesaid irreconcilable differences. But the insurer could refuse cover for any one of them, if so minded. As the scheme is still very much in embryo, Peter Bedford would rather not be contacted about it as yet (he's on holiday for the next week or two, anyway). But I promise to report on developments in due course. AS it happens, besides news of insurance against disaster, I can today offer a faint sign of hope. It appears in the underlying table which shows the state of demand for managers and higher-ranked specialists in the United Kingdom, as gauged by the MSL International consultancy's three-monthly counts of executive jobs advertised in national journals. That is not to say there is anything but gloom in the overall figures in the lower part of the table. The latest total is by far the lowest for any 12 months to September 30, not only since 1987-88, but in all the 33 years MSL has been keeping check. The quarterly tallies below the total show that the rate of decline, as measured by the corresponding three months of 1991, quickened again between April-June and July-September just gone. Bleakness also prevails in the separate counts, not listed in the table, which the consultancy makes of advertised openings in four sectors of industry. All are at their lowest on record for any 12 months to September 30. High-tech companies' tally fell below four digits for the first time to 967 as against a high of 6,151 in 1984-85. The peak of 4,367 reached by energy and associated industries in the same year, is down to 1,025. Food, drink and tobacco companies have fallen to 511 from a 1984-85 high of 1,150, and retailing to 482 compared with 1,145 four years ago. But look in the upper part of the table, which shows the 12-monthly counts for different sorts of executive work. Although seven of the eight admittedly also show further declines, we do see the first single year-on-year rise since 1988-89. Moreover, it is in the sales and marketing category which in ages past has proved a lead indicator of movements in the market as a whole. Not too much should be made of it, because it is a category which has been singularly depressed. But the mere fact that it has rebounded is more reason for cheer than the Jobs column has seen for a long time.</p>

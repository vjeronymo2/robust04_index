			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Abu Dhabi to hold BCCI trial: Preliminary fraud charges laid against former bank executives ABU DHABI has laid preliminary fraud charges against 14 former executives of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and intends to hold a formal trial in the emirate. In the first press interview given by the Abu Dhabi majority shareholders in BCCI since the bank was closed in July 1991, Mr Ahmed al-Sayegh, one of the officials investigating the affair, said yesterday that Abu Dhabi intended to give all the former BCCI officers it had detained a fair trial. Formal charges have yet to be laid against the former executives and discussions are still being held about three others detained in the emirate. Mr al-Sayegh said Abu Dhabi would seek to pursue individuals whom it believed had defrauded the state. 'We are going to go after everybody who has conned us,' he said. He assured depositors that the emirate would honour the compensation agreement it had negotiated with Touche Ross, the bank's liquidator. Mr al-Sayegh also promised that Abu Dhabi intended to take a tough stance in civil actions against third parties. He said it was fully committed to suing Price Waterhouse, BCCI's auditor, which the majority shareholders believed did not keep them adequately informed about the bank's problems. Abu Dhabi has told Lord Justice Bingham, whose report into the regulation of BCCI is expected to be published next month, that Price Waterhouse was involved in a conflict of interest in accepting various roles in the investigation of the bank. Mr al-Sayegh said Price Waterhouse was serving in four different capacities  - as adviser on the restructuring plan for BCCI, in the investigation into allegations of fraud, as auditor to BCCI, and in its capacity as the reporting accountant to the Bank of England. Price Waterhouse said yesterday it felt confident it could defend any conflict of interest accusations. It said its membership of the restructuring and investigation committees was with the consent and approval of Abu Dhabi. Its reporting duties to the Bank of England had been fully understood by the Abu Dhabi officials then involved. US prosecutors asked a federal judge yesterday to postpone the trial of Mr Clark Clifford, former defence secretary, so that New York prosecutors could try him first on charges that he took bribes and lied to banking regulators, Reuter reports from Washington. The request ended a battle between federal and New York prosecutors over which jurisdiction would first try Mr Clifford  - a former adviser to several US presidents - and his law partner Mr Robert Altman. The two have been accused of accepting bribes to hide BCCI's illegal ownership of First American, Washington's biggest bank, before BCCI was shut last year. Abu Dhabi defends its actions, Page 7</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Combined Onslaught by Opposition"; all quotation </F> marks as published]    [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 21. The recent price hike saw the  Opposition in full cry today as Parliament began its Budget  session with a boycott of the President's address by the  National Front and Left parties, and a BJP-led (Bharatiya Janata  Party) walkout in both Houses. The Opposition leaders, cutting  across party lines, accused the Government of attempting to  "bypass" Parliament by raising prices on the eve of the Budget.    After the NF-Left (National Front) alliance had set the ball  rolling in the morning by staying away from the President, Dr.  Shankar Dayal Sharma's address in the Central Hall of  Parliament, the BJP launched the second offensive when the two  Houses later met separately. The walkout in the Lok Sabha was  led by the leader of the Opposition, Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee,  and by his counterpart, Mr. Sikander Bakht, in the Rajya Sabha.    The Government was clearly on the defensive, as the  Opposition repeatedly charged it with "lowering" the dignity of  Parliament and of rendering the Budget presentation  "meaningless." Some Congress(I) members in both the Houses tried  bravely to take on the Opposition, but quickly retreated in the  face of a sharp counter-attack.    The "action" began as soon as members returned to their  respective Houses after the joint sitting. In the Lok Sabha, Mr.  Vajpayee rose to protest against the price hikes immediately  after the House had made obituary references to its five former  members who died recently, and the Prime Minister had introduced  the two new Ministers -- Mr. Ram Lakhan Singh Yadav and Dr. C.  Silvera.    `Budget rendered meaningless': Mr. Vajpayee  pointed out that the Budget presentation had a certain  "sanctity" about it, and the people waited for it with a sense  of anticipation. By raising prices of a wide range of essential  commodities, a few weeks before the Budget, the Government had  rendered the Budget "meaningless."    Charging the Government with having committed an  impropriety,  Mr. Vajpayee urged the Speaker, Mr. Shivraj Patil, to pull up  the Government. What the Government had done amounted to an  "insult" to Parliament, he argued, insisting on a ruling from  the Speaker and warning the Treasury benches that the Opposition  would not let them get away with it. The ruling party may have  managed a majority in the House, but this did not mean that it  could ignore Parliament.</p>

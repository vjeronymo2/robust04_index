			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / People: New chairmen in insurance Sir Christopher Benson, the property developer, is to become the new chairman of Sun Alliance, one of the country's biggest insurance companies. Sir Christopher, now 59, takes over from Henry Lambert, who will retire at the company's agm next month. Lambert, who is 67, has been a director since 1972 and chairman for the past eight years - a period of mixed fortunes for the group. Sun Alliance saw spectacular growth in its financial strength in the late 1980s, as a result of the boom in the UK equity and property markets, to which the group was heavily committed as an investor. More recently, however, the company has been hit badly by losses from mortgage indemnity insurance as a result of the slump in the housing market. Sir Christopher, who has been a director since 1988 and who recently retired as chairman of MEPC, the property group, retains his chairmanships of Boots and The Housing Corporation, and less happily, his membership of the Lloyd's insurance market, where, like many other Names, he has been hard hit recently.</p>

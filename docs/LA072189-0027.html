			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> The work of died-in-the-wool formalists has proven the old adage that if you  plumb structure carefully enough, some deeper reality is revealed.  Australian-born photographer Grant Mudford says that his work is designed to  take one subject and thoroughly examine its formal features in a controlled  setting. He applied this strategy to earlier abstractions of urban architecture  and now scores another coup in a current suite of structurally exact  black-and-white photo portraits of Los Angeles artists.  </P> <P> Mudford paid his dues for many years working as a professional photographer and  the technical acumen garnered in the real world pays off. For each finished  portrait, he shoots several hundred views of the same frontal bust pose, then  lets a perfectionist eye scrutinize negatives for the best one. Designing his  own elaborate equipment, positioning his enlarger a great distance from a wide  blank wall where huge photo paper has been mounted, Mudford is able to blow up  small, precise negatives and end up with crisp, nearly 5-foot images. Using a  fine-grain photo paper and controlling depth of field, he records his stark mug  shots (that is really what they remind us of) with every mole, blemish, wrinkle  and furrowed brow writ large.  </P> <P> Artist subjects wore what they wished (bare-chested John Boskovich wears a  cross and an earring) and Mudford toyed with a limited number of variables --  background, clothing and hair -- to pictorially organize and exaggerate the  penetrating stares of some of Los Angeles' innovators. There's Mike Kelley in  shoulder-length jet-black hair, a puffy-faced Chris Burden whose glint looks  boyishly edgy. Lean and assiduous as his formidable abstractions, Roy Dowell  looks out from the dark geometry of his vest, and the handsome face of Renee  Petropoulos peeks out from the exotic headgear she donned for the sitting.

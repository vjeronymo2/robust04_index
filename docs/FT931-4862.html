			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: FNFC requests banks to extend agreements FIRST NATIONAL Finance Corporation, the consumer credit group, has written to its 120 banks - to which it owes Pounds 1.3bn - asking them to extend or maintain lending agreements while the group's funding is determined. FNFC is in default on its loans because of what it decribes as 'trivial' and 'technical' breaches of agreements, of which it has more than 100. Mr Martin Mays-Smith, chairman, said the default was not on payment obligations: 'We have always paid interest and continue to do so. The only thing that is significant is that the banks have a legal right to immediate repayment.' FNFC is asking the banks to waive the breaches - which are to do with infringements of bans on guarantees between parent and subsidiaries - and to maintain facilities. This includes extending the expiry date on about Pounds 250m of loans, due this month, in the group's main subsidiary, First National Bank. Yesterday the group was composing a letter to shareholders which also deals with changes in circumstances since a Pounds 45.8m rights issue of convertible preference shares was announced on January 15. The issue was necessary to repair a capital base weakened by two years of heavy losses. The breaches of banking agreements were not disclosed at the time even though most were known about by management and Kleinwort Benson, its merchant bank. It was decided they were not important because they were 'old, technical and expected to be remedied in the short-term,' as one advisers put it yesterday. The breaches have prevented Pounds 160m being raised through the securitisation of unsecured home improvement loans. This was planned for the first half of this year, the rights issue document said. The impression was given at the time of the issue that Pounds 100m of new term finance would be made available. This has not come to fruition either. Mr Mays-Smith said on Friday that some banks in one of the syndicates were 'fussing a bit'. Some of the overseas lenders were under pressure to reduce their UK exposure. As he faces a period of intense negotiations with the banks, he anticipates there will again be 'a few on the periphery who will cause trouble. 'There are occasions when a militant minority stop something sensible being done, but that's not very often.' As well as seeking waivers of breaches and extension of facilities, the discussions hope to condense the 100-plus agreements into three - one for the parent and one for each of the main subsidiaries. Management consultants will check internal controls on who can write what into documents, to avoid the contradictions that ed to the breaches. The share price, which rose to 80p last month, was 57p.

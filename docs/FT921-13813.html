			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Soviet officers call for a united army: Two students die in protest over food price rises as defence minister warns of chaos DISGRUNTLED Soviet army officers emerged yesterday as a political force in their own right. They demanded that the unity of the armed forces be preserved in spite of the break-up of the USSR. Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the defence minister and commander in chief, described the armed forces as 'our last barrier against disintegration'. His warning came as the drastic economic reforms in the republics of the former Soviet Union claimed their first victims yesterday. Two students were reported by Tass news agency to have been killed in the Uzbek capital Tashkent when a protest over the sharp price rises that followed the freeing of state prices turned violent. Marshal Shaposhnikov, warning of dire consequences if the future of the army was not settled quickly, said: 'The course of events has reached the border beyond which lie feuding, chaos and national if not global tragedy.' He was addressing a meeting of 5,000 officers in Moscow, the first such conference since the break-up of the Soviet Union. The meeting voted to set up a co-ordinating council to represent the officers at talks with leaders of the new Commonwealth of Independent States. President Boris Yeltsin appealed to the officers to 'help preserve civic calm'. He said: 'It is easy enough to start a fire. It is far more difficult to extinguish it.' Mr Yeltsin also announced that Russia was taking over the armed forces stationed in non-commonwealth republics - the Baltics and Georgia. The proceeds of arms sales would go to finance officers' welfare and personnel costs. The military officers voted unanimously to appeal to the Commonwealth leaders to retain a single armed force and to refrain from unilateral actions until an overall solution is found. Commonwealth leaders have put off a decision on the future of the military until a summit meeting in Minsk on February 14. The conference was called in response to republican leaders' difficulties in agreeing what to do about the armed forces. Broadcast live on television, the delegates from all over the former Soviet Union angrily vented demands for better living standards and an end to attempts by republics to dismantle the 3m-strong army. Ukraine's decision to make officers and men swear an oath of allegiance to the newly-independent state, along with its attempts to take over the Black Sea fleet, have been a particular source of anger. The assembly also saw the political comeback of Colonel Viktor Alksnis, the arch-conservative former Communist who led a persistent campaign against the break-up of the Soviet Union. The popular colonel is to be a member of the officer's co-ordinating council. Prices burden, Page 2</p>

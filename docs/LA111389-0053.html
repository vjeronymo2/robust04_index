			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> PONTY OVERCOMES VIOLIN'S LIMITS -- BUT NOT THOSE OF HIS REPERTOIRE  </P> <P> The violin seems an unlikely instrument to front a fusion band. The  amplification required to put it on equal sonic footing with electric guitars,  keyboards and tightly miked drum kits causes a loss of the instrument's  characteristic woody timbres and dynamic range. In short, wiring a violin cuts  into its expressive capabilities.  </P> <P> Electric violinist Jean-Luc Ponty largely overcame these challenges Friday,  playing a bright-blue instrument in front of an enthusiastic crowd at the  Celebrity Theatre of Anaheim. In a program that matched originals dating back  into the '70s with a fair sampling of material from his recently released  "Storytelling," Ponty painted cool landscapes with deft phrasing, gliding  portamento effects and the occasional electronic gimmickry while his supporting  quartet cruised behind.  </P> <P> But that does not mean the evening was without problems. No matter which Ponty  period it came from, the music showed little diversity over the course of this  long performance. As the tales unfolded one after another, it became apparent  that the emphasis was on setting rather than plot. Too many of the numbers  washed back and forth between chords, recalling such moody seascapes as  Debussy's "La Mer" and Rachmaninoff's "Isle of the Dead."  </P> <P> Others featured Ponty scaling his way over predictable riffs to high-pitched  vistas where, like the bear who went over the mountain, he discovered nothing  more than the other side.  </P> <P> The performance's effect was much like that from a drive across the prairie  states. Initially, one is impressed with the distance to the horizon and the  vast blue sky. But then a certain boredom sets in as the unchanging scenery  stretches on and on.  </P> <P> This does not mean that Ponty has embraced the mellow moods and blind optimism  of the New Age. Though the chord changes in his music may be as infrequent, the  general mood was more involved, with frenzied string solos sailing over  minor-key riffs. This was music with a big beat, thanks to drummer Rayford  Griffin, with Ponty's own lyrical ways as the romantic focus of interest.  </P> <P> The most interesting compositions heard on this evening were the most recent.  "In the Fast Lane" used electronic gloss and hard-driving timekeeping from  Griffin to provide Ponty with a chance to show speed as well as sensitivity.  "After the Storm," with Ponty taking a turn on keyboards, featured a furious  introduction before guitarist Jamie Glaser's screaming solo.  </P> <P> The band, whose members can all be heard on "Storytelling," was generally  competent, if not as tight as heard on the recording. Bassist Baron Browne  showed plenty of muscle, but lacked crispness. Glaser adeptly provided rhythmic  chordal backing while his sound carried a head-shaking metallic glint. Wally  Minko's keyboard support was on the money, and his solos showed a lot of  harmonic smarts. But, ironically, his acoustic excursions lost a lot of impact  because of poor reproduction, the piano sounding tinny and distant during a  moving duet between himself and Ponty entitled "Eulogy for Oscar Romero."  </P> <P> For his part, Ponty constructed beautifully melodic solos without becoming  indulgent. It is obvious that he has the skills to convey high drama on the  violin, even if the volume levels required for this type of music cut into the  instrument's expressiveness. With more varied material, Ponty could be leading  one of the better electric jazz bands around.  </P></p>

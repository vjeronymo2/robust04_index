			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Business Travel: The risk of going that extra mile - What might happen if all air passengers tried to cash in their offers at once Free airline seats are a perk for the frequent air traveller. But visions of aircraft full of passengers flying for free are beginning to trouble the airlines. How could the airlines cope? Might the cost force them to renege on their free-flight offers, or close down the frequent-flyer programme entirely? Frequent-flyer schemes are designed to make passengers loyal to a particular airline. They are awarded points - Air Miles in British Airways' case, for example - when they fly. The points can be accumulated and eventually cashed in for free tickets. Concern has focused particularly on the BA programme. The fear is that the scheme's 3.5m members could swamp the airline's flights if all those eligible requested their free tickets at once. Such worries are not with-out foundation. During the 1980s, some US carriers, such as Pan Am, offered ever greater frequent-flyer incentives to passengers. Eventually, holders of free tickets displaced genuine fare payers, hastening Pan Am's descent into bankruptcy. BA, which started its scheme in 1988, says this cannot happen today. At worst, it concedes, scheme members might not be able to book seats on their first choice of flight. This is already the case for 2 per cent of people asking for free tickets. The airline is confident nothing will go wrong, because it controls the number of tickets given away on each flight. It and many other airlines have computer programmes that predict how full the flight will be. The results are used to forecast demand, plan capacity and allocate seats to frequent-flyer programme members and to other incentive schemes, such as that run through the UK food retailer, J. Sainsbury. The principle is simple, says BA: 'We do not give away any seats we think we can sell.' In its last full year, BA had a 'load factor' - the average proportion of seats filled on its flights - of 66 per cent, a figure that historically is high for any airline. The remaining 34 per cent of seats on its 240 aircraft are available to be offered in incentive schemes. Last year, Air Miles travellers accounted for only about 5 per cent of these spare seats. Even if all 2m air miles accumulated by scheme members and not yet redeemed were cashed in this year, this would only take 10 per cent of the unused capacity. Much of this spare capacity, however, is on flights to less popular destinations. The seat you want on a flight to the city where you are doing business might be unavailable. There are three busy periods when all seats are likely to be taken by fare-payers: the first and last flights of the days to business destinations such as Paris and Brussels; the first and last flights of the week to long-haul business destinations such as New York and Hong Kong; and peak holiday times such as July and August and Christmas. You may get a free seat on one of these flights, says BA, but it is 'likely to be more difficult'. Some of this is in the small print of the frequent-flyer scheme rules, as are other restrictions such as expiry dates on air miles awarded. But as seasoned business travellers must already have suspected, when faced with the choice of pleasing applicants for free tickets or passengers proffering ready cash, any airline is going to take the money.</p>

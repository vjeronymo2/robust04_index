			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OAKLAND ATHLETICS  </P> <P> Regarding "Brains, Bats and Big Bucks," by Mark A. Stein (Aug. 26).  </P> <P> I'm just curious about the "big bucks" that Jose Canseco and Rickey Henderson  got paid for the article written about them, considering that for their  autographs they charge their fans a fee of $22 (Canseco) and $20 (Henderson).  All the media hype will probably raise their fees. The rich get richer, and the  stupid pay.  </P> <P> VIRGINIA TUCKER  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

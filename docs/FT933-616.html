			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Goldsmiths cuts losses by 42% Tight cost controls, reduced interest charges and an improvement in sales and margins helped Goldsmiths Group, the retail jeweller, cut losses from Pounds 1.88m to Pounds 1.1m for the six months to August 28. Turnover was up from Pounds 18.3m to Pounds 19.7m. 'We are seeing a distinct improvement at the top end of the market,' said Mr Jurek Piasecki, chairman. 'This is particularly so in the south-east which is currently 16 per cent up on the corresponding period last year.' Directors have decided to pass the interim dividend and will review the final once the outcome for the year, which is strongly dependent on the Christmas market, is known. Losses per share were reduced to 3.35p (5.74p).</p>

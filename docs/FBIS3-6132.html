The film "Turn" shows imperishable feats performed by the  dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in the ideological field by  proclaiming the programme of modelling the whole society on the  chuche idea on February 19, 1974, and bringing about a new turn  in the party's ideological work.    "Embraced in the Bosom of Great Love" shows Yi In-mo living  a  happy life with great glory, highly praised by people at home  and abroad as the incarnation of faith and will, after returning  home.    Yi In-mo goes round significant places of the socialist  homeland which made a signal development, keenly feeling the  benevolence of the party and the leader, solicitude of the  socialist system and the love of the revolutionary comrades. He  says our leader, our party and our country were the best and he  is now in an "Earthly Paradise."    "Long Live the Great Rural Theses" and "Yongsan-ri Undergoes  Changes" represent the looks of the countryside that has changed  beyond recognition thanks to the great socialist rural theses  and the happiness of the people. "Intimate Feelings of Kinship"  vividly depicts the true appearance of Korean-style socialism in  which all the people form a big harmonious family and help and  lead each other forward.    Among the newly released documentary films are also  "Self-Reliance Is the Spirit of Korea," "Masters of Forests" and  "Respected People" which introduce the noble spiritual world and  beautiful traits of honest-minded people who have devoted their  all to the country, the people, the society, the collective and  the revolutionary comrades, doing what the party wants.</p>

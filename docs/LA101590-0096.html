			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC NOTES  </P> <P> As Vietnam's relations with the West slowly improve, Japanese investors and  traders are cautiously returning to a country that they have shunned for 15  years. A spokesman for the trading firm Toyomenka Kaisha, which is building a  factory in Vietnam to make glue, said: "It has become easier to start a  business in Vietnam with less foreign pressure.  </P> <P> The economy is revitalizing. Labor costs are cheap and raw materials  plentiful." In dealing with Vietnam, most Japanese firms have been using front  companies while concealing their own names. But as the political climate  improves, more and more are throwing off the disguise. Official Vietnamese  figures show that Japan was the fourth-biggest foreign investor this year, with  $71 million in six projects, after France, Britain and Belgium. The Japan  External Trade Organization, a semi-governmental agency, said Vietnam still had  a long way to go before it became an attractive investment because it was  handicapped by poor roads and inadequate power supply.  </P></p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Appointments: BAe plays its Gulf card British Aerospace is strengthening its firepower in its battles with the Ministry of Defence by securing the services of Air Chief Marshal Sir Patrick Hine, the overall commander of British forces in last year's war against Iraq. Faced with cutbacks in military orders and increased competition, the company is playing its Gulf card - the goodwill gained through the role its products and support personnel played in the campaign - for all it is worth. 'Paddy' Hine, who ran the UK command bunker at High Wycombe, retired from his post at RAF Strike Command in August. He actually began work at BAe's Strand headquarters in January, but his appointment as military adviser has only now been made public. He succeeds another Air Chief Marshal, Sir David Evans, who retires at the end of the month. He is one of the few Gulf commanders not writing a book about the war - that is, he says, not while he is working for BAe. The book he is thinking of would be critical of some aspects of the handling of the campaign. Since the MoD is BAe's chief customer, he believes 'it is better left for the time being'. He sees his job principally as helping BAe deal with the ministry, using his experience of how it works and thinks. At 59, he foresees four to six years at most in the job. 'It depends if my face fits,' he says. ***** Coutts &amp; Co, NatWest's upmarket private banking business, continues to reshuffle its senior management team. Jack Willson, aged 56, has become senior manager of Coutt's city office at 15 Lombard Street. He joined Coutts in 1952 and has spent the past 14 years managing one of its branches in the Strand. He replaces Christopher Rashbrook, aged 53, who is retiring after 36 years with the bank. ***** J HENRY SCHRODER WAGG &amp; CO has increased its tally of directors to 67 by appointing Rupert Birch, Sriram Chari, Peter Hennessey, Arnaud Limal and The Hon Nicholas Smith. Clive Boothman and Peter Wolton are to be directors of Schroder Investment Management. Elizabeth Goldhill is appointed first vice-president of Schroder Capital Management International Inc and Ltd.</p>

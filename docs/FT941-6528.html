			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Raglan issue increases portfolio Raglan Property Trust, the property development and investment company, is reinvesting the bulk of the proceeds from its recent rights issue in the Pounds 16.5m acquisition of a portfolio of retail and office properties. Raglan announced a 2-for-1 rights issue in November, raising Pounds 19m for 'selective property investment'. The new portfolio has a broad spread of locations, and offers an initial yield of more than 9 per cent. The company is emerging from four years of losses. Raglan now has a portfolio of properties with a book value of about Pounds 50m, while net debt is approximately Pounds 22m. The management said it would be happy with a higher level of gearing. It aims to build up its rental portfolio, providing cash to channel into its core property development. This is a 223,000 sq ft site in Banbury, which will be developed into a town centre shopping mall.</p>

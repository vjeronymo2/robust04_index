			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFICIT: 'WHY NO OUTRAGE?'  </P> <P> The editorial deplored the lack of "outrage" regarding the truly staggering  deficits the Administration has incurred.  </P> <P> It is an outrage that in times of peace we run such deficits. It is an outrage  that in times of economic properity we run such deficits. It is an outrage that  the Administration has used this device to lead the populace into a false sense  of security. It is an outrage that no one seems to be outraged about this, that  few voices call out.  </P> <P> In the past decade the United States has evolved from the world's leading  creditor nation to the world's leading debtor nation. If the consequences of  this condition are as serious as I imagine, I think the damage to our society  will far outweigh any suffered in past wars, and that the political historians  of the next generation could label this outrage as treason.  </P> <P> WILL CONNELL  </P> <P> Glendora  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AQMD'S HEARING BOARD CHAIRMAN STEPPING DOWN  </P> <P> Harold V. Brown abruptly resigned Thursday as chairman of the South Coast Air  Quality Management District hearing board, declaring that he wanted "to get rid  of some of the hassles."  </P> <P> Mark Abramowitz, a member of the five-member panel and a former leader of the  Venice-based Coalition for Clean Air, was elected to succeed Brown effective  Jan. 1.  </P> <P> Abramowitz will serve through June 30.  </P> <P> The hearing board, whose members are appointed by the AQMD's governing board,  is a quasi-judicial body that rules on polluters' appeals of district staff  decisions.  </P> <P> Lately, there have been complaints that the board has fallen behind schedule in  issuing decisions and has not been evenhanded in its rulings.  </P> <P> "We don't move our (agenda) very well. I think a lot of people see me as  someone who can move the agenda. People also need to be given swift justice and  there has been some concern they haven't gotten that," Abramowitz said.  </P> <P> Brown, 72, a retired occupational health specialist who was first appointed to  the hearing panel in 1985, said he was tired of dealing with "motions, counter  motions, objections, the vagueness of the law."  </P> <P> Abramowitz told fellow board members after his unanimous election that he  intended to "sit down and look at concerns procedural about our operations.  </P> <P> "I want to ensure that everybody who comes before the board is going to be  assured of a very fair hearing -- as they always have. They will have the  benefit of my full attention," Abramowitz said.  </P> <P> In 1984, Abramowitz successfully sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  to require it to disapprove the AQMD's clean air plan. Abramowitz argued that  the plan failed to guarantee that the region could comply with federal clean  air standards.  </P></p>

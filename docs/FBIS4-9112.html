			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 21 (AFP) -- A convoy of 100 UN  troops and 41 medical personnel left Sarajevo Thursday for the  battered Moslem enclave of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia, UNPROFOR  spokesman Major Rob Annink said. The convoy, including French,  British and Ukrainian troops, would attempt to enter the  enclave, where 65,000 are under Serbian attack, if the fighting  there was not too intense, Annink said.</p>

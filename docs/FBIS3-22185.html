The minister for environment, Mr. Kamalnath, says  India is opposed to any absolute specifications for conservation  of forests which are a community asset. Addressing a round  table discussion organized by the UN Environment Program and  UNCTAD [United Nations Conference on Trade and Development] in  Geneva, he termed the efforts to put environmental barriers on  trade as green imperialism. Mr. Kamalnath said any move for  global (?ecological) system amounts to legitimizing  extraterritorial interference. He called for a moratorium on  linking trade with environment unless it impinges clearly on  collective ecological security.</p>

Dr. al-Agha said that those steps are in no way sufficient  and do not represent serious measures vis-a-vis the size of the  tragedy that has taken place. He added that the release of a  few hundred prisoners has no connection with any serious steps,  especially as the prison term of most of those prisoners was  about to end.    As for the Palestinian leadership's stance toward the  painful  massacre and the steps that it has taken, Dr. al-Agha said that  the Palestinian leadership's response is somewhat acceptable and  is epitomized by suspending the talks until two basic conditions  are met. They are:    1. Placing the settlements issue as a top priority on the  agenda and, ultimately, evacuating the settlements and disarming  the settlers.    2. Imposing international protection, with UN supervision,  in the occupied territories to ensure that the Palestinians live  in peace and security.</p>

Not less than  180,000 signatures must be raised for the referendum to go ahead.    A session of the Kazan branch of the ITTIFAK Tatar party of  national independence has expelled from its membership Flera  Zaynullina, party secretary, who recently was awarded the title  of "Valorous Daughter of the Tatar People." Observers believe  that one of the reasons for this was her statement at the World  Assembly of Turkic People (Washington, 2 through 5 December  1993) which abounded in attacks on Russians and representatives  of other ethnic groups living in the republic.    Meanwhile the first Russia-wide Tatar newspaper, BERDEMLEK  (Unity), founded by the Tatarstan Government and ROSSIYSKAYA  GAZETA, has been launched; this is the first ethnic publication  in the Russian Federation with nationwide status (circulation  over 1 million copies). BERDEMLEK will come out in Russian once  a week as a supplement to ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA and will be  distributed in all regions of the Russian Federation with the  view to give objective coverage of events in Tatarstan.</p>

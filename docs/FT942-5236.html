			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Working Life: Mind games - Reading matter Today is June 6, and here is your homily for the day. 'Expand your perspective by expanding your mind. Vizualize in rich detail. Involve as many emotions and feelings as possible.' There are plenty more where that one came from, 364 to be exact, one for every day of the year in a handy pocket-sized volume that promises to help executives through life's difficult moments. Self help books for managers are two a penny, but Daily Reflections for Highly Effective People is a little unusual. Most have the virtue of offering clear guidance - do x, y, z, they say, and you'll be successful. By contrast, this book is so obscure that the reader may find it hard to decipher the 'daily reflections', let alone find a way of incorporating them into the working day. 'Anything less than Win/Win in an interdependent reality is a poor second best that will have impact in the long-term relationship', the book preaches for September 8. What on earth does that mean? It would be tempting conclude that you can publish any old rubbish these days so long as you claim on the dust jacket that it will make managers more successful. However, 3m people can't be wrong. At least that number, from the US to China to Germany, own a copy of author Dr Stephen R Covey's most famous work, 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. This said all you needed to do was to acquire seven habits - including 'begin with the end in mind' and 'be proactive' - and the world would be your oyster. The latest work is aimed at the further millions out there for whom the earlier one was too long and heavy. It promises to provide the same 'holistic sense of personal effectiveness and purpose' in a more succinct format. And those of us who doubt its worth, we must need the book most. Dr Covey would no doubt tell us that we are sadly lacking that win/win habit. Daily Reflections for Highly Effective People, By Stephen R Covey. Simon &amp; Schuster, 369pp, Pounds 4.99.</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Pinault set to buy Credit Lyonnais' stake in Fnac Credit Lyonnais, the French state-owned bank, is set to sell a controlling stake in Fnac, France's leading books and music retailer which has a stock market capitalisation of about FFr3bn (Dollars 557m). The buyer is expected to be Mr Francois Pinault, who controls Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, the distribution and retailing group. Credit Lyonnais confirmed that Artemis, the holding company, through which the Pinault family controls Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, is involved in negotiations. An announcement should be made shortly, it said. The sale of Fnac represents part of the recovery strategy at Credit Lyonnais, which suffered net losses of FFr6.9bn last year. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman, has said he is seeking to dispose of about FFr20bn worth of assets over the next two years in an attempt to consolidate the bank's activities and raise capital. The sale of the 64.6 per cent stake in Fnac, which is held through its Altus Finance subsidiary, could raise up to FFr1.9bn, according to industry analysts. Credit Lyonnais's decision to sell control of Fnac is also the latest step in the turbulent history of the books and music chain, which was founded in 1954 and has grown into one of France's largest retail groups with annual sales of just under FFr9bn and about 50 stores. Last year, GMF, the troubled insurance group, sold control of Fnac to a consortium comprising subsidiaries of Credit Lyonnais and Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the communications, utilities and construction group. At the time, Mr Pinault and several of Europe's largest retail groups - including Kingfisher of the UK, Bertelsmann of Germany, and Havas of France - expressed an interest in acquiring Fnac. The disposal planned by Credit Lyonnais is complicated by pre-emption rights held by Generale des Eaux, which holds 34 per cent of the shares in Fnac through its subsidiary, Compagnie Immobiliere du Phenix. Generale des Eaux has one month to decide whether to seek to acquire Fnac itself, keep its shares or sell to the successful bidder. The sale of Fnac may also be referred to the French privatisation commission. Mr Pinault, who has long sought to acquire Fnac, has this year been engaged in controversy surrounding an offer to buy out minority shareholders in La Redoute, the group mail order subsidiary. Some minority shareholders rejected the terms of the offer, which was finally approved in May. The attraction of Fnac has increased following its return to profits growth in the first half of 1993-94. In the six months ended February, it recorded net profits of FFr60.6m, compared with FFr50.5m a year ago. See Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / International Company News: Full speed ahead for IBM and Bull - The rationale behind the computer groups' accord Engineers from Groupe Bull, the French computer manufacturer, will begin to take up residence at International Business Machines' computer design centre in Austin, Texas, within the next few days. Their arrival will be the first and most controversial consequence of the technological and marketing agreement concluded recently between the two computer makers. In Austin, the Bull team will work with IBM and its partners Apple Computers and Motorola on the design of microchips planned to be at the heart of tomorrow's personal computers. Bull will have a unique window into the future of computer technology. While almost every important detail of last week's agreement has yet to be spelled out in detail - the size of the equity stake IBM has agreed to take in Bull, for example, or the annual value of Bull's orders for IBM's small disk drives - both companies appreciate the need for speed if they are to make the most of their initiative. Within months, Bull will be selling IBM mid-range computers badged with Bull's green tree logo; by the end of the year, the cabinets will be Bull's but the chips at the heart of the system will still be IBM. The new understanding between IBM, the world's largest computer maker, and Bull, state-owned and losing money heavily, began as a search for a straightforward technology agreement. Bull needed a source of a new technology called 'reduced instruction set computing (risc)' available only from US suppliers - IBM, Hewlett Packard (HP), Digital Equipment, Sun Microsystems and Mips. It elected to choose between IBM and HP. IBM was looking for a partner to licence its risc technology to increase manufacturing volumes and improve distribution. In the past year it has struck oem (original equipment manufacturer) deals with Wang of the US for personal computers and mid-range machines and with Siemens of Germany for memory chips. The deal with Bull, however, has grown into a complex, two-way relationship which will have far-reaching consequences for the world computer industry. 'Bull's position as a viable vendor has received a much needed boost' the Gartner Group, a well-regard-ed US consultancy said, immediately following the deal. Risc technology was invented by IBM. It makes possible powerful but low cost computer systems through simple silicon chip design in combination with complex software. It is seen as the technology of choice for mid-range computers and, increasingly, personal computers. Typically, risc computers run the Unix operating system, developed by AT&amp;T and set to become the industry standard for small and medium computers. The key to making profits from risc computers, as for personal computers, is high volume and efficient distribution. Mr Bob Dies, director-general, products and systems, IBM Europe, and his opposite number at Bull, Mr Michel Bloch, managed the burden of the negotiations. Mr Michael Armstrong, head of IBM world trade, and Mr Francis Lorentz, Bull chairman and chief executive handled the final stages. The French government, as Bull's majority shareholder, gave its approval to Mr Lorentz's desire to seal a deal with IBM: 'We did not know we had been selected until Mrs Cresson, the prime minister, announced it' Mr Dies said. IBM lost money for the first time in 1991 and has put in place a profound restructuring strategy to restore profitability. There was little to choose between the risc technology on offer from IBM and HP in the view of Bull's experts. Why then did Mr Lorentz opt for IBM? He gave six reasons. IBM would be prepared to take a large number, perhaps 100,000, of portable computers a year from Bull subsidiary Zenith Data Systems to sell under its own label. There was the possibility of creating a separate, global, printed circuit board business based on Bull's manufacturing facilities at Angers, France, and Boston in the US. Bull would take the lead in developing powerful networks of risc processors, an advanced technology called 'symmetrical multiprocessing (smp)'. IBM would benefit from being able to save resources it would otherwise have to pour into its own smp project. A computation of the profit and loss account over four years for each of the potential partners came out in IBM's favour. He believed that software houses - whose application programs can make or break a hardware supplier - would be more encouraged to write for IBM designs than for HP. He was concerned about speculation, however absurd, that Hitachi, the Japanese electronics giant, might launch a takeover bid for HP. HP licences its own version of risc to Hitachi, which builds workstations based around it. The agreement transforms Bull's credibility but as the Gartner Group points out, its future is dependent on the delivery of the products. Gartner believes there is only a 75 per cent chance of success in the symmetrical multiprocessor development. Michael Armstrong, led final stages of deal for IBM</p>

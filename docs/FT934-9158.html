			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Unigate brightens Half-year profits from Unigate provided the only bright spot in a food manufacturing sector undermined by a broker's gloomy forecasts. Smith New Court predicted a further deterioration in trading conditions in reiterating its 'underweight' stance. Unigate's figures were at the top end of market forecasts, although there were some one-off benefits and specialists said underlying growth levels reflected the increasingly difficult environment. The shares, however, responded positively, advancing 6 to 371p. Analysts left their full-year forecasts largely unchanged. In its latest note, Smith attributes its negative stance to pricing pressures from powerful supermarket chains and the disappearance of food price inflation. It said its earnings growth forecast for the sector of around 8 per cent was likely to be dramatically reduced if supermarket price discounting became a permanent fixture.

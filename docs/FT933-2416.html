			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Three steps to success - Unit Trusts / Gartmore British Growth A NEW person in charge always likes to make a fresh start. When Duncan Trinder took over the running of the Gartmore British Growth fund in June 1989, he says he stood back and asked himself what holders would want a unit trust to provide. He decided there were three main factors: the ability consistently to outperform the FT-A All-Share; to provide liquidity by investing in marketable stocks; and for the manager to perform serious, in-depth research on individual shares. 'The only way of achieving all three objectives,' says Trinder, 'was to concentrate on a restrictive list of around 200 large companies. Choosing the right large companies can produce outperformance, large company stocks provide liquidity and a restrictive list allows you to conduct in-depth research.' Trinder says he cut the number of holdings in the fund down from 90 to 25 stocks. 'Management of this trust is very much a stock-picking exercise. In no way is this an index fund.' This certainly makes sense from Gartmore's point of view; it already has a low-cost trust (no initial charge, annual charge 0.5 per cent) which tracks the All-Share. There is no magic formula to successful investment, says Trinder. But he adds: 'Ever since I've been involved in the stock market, it has been sector-driven. Every industry has a cycle, which is dependent on too much or too little capacity. When capacity is short, pricing is strong and profitability is strong.' Accordingly, he tries to find stocks that can benefit from the cycle and that have a below-average market rating and an above-average dividend yield. He says he is more of a value than a growth investor. 'I don't like paying high price-earnings ratios and I don't get emotionally involved with stocks. If the p/e is high and you feel the position could deteriorate, you should sell the stock.' As an example of his style, he cites the reasons for buying shares in GEC, his largest holding which forms 8 per cent of the fund. When he first bought stock, GEC shares were on a price-earnings ratio of only 75 per cent of market average and on a high yield. The company had conservative accounting policies, scope for margin improvement and alliances with major companies such as Siemens. The shares have risen from 185p at the time of his first purchase to around 340p today. Apart from GEC, the rest of Trinder's top 10 stocks are: Prudential, Hanson, George Wimpey, BICC, BPB, Great Universal Stores, Cable &amp; Wireless, Lonrho and Reed International. The list shows a greater concentration on capital goods stocks. 'Capital goods companies will perform a lot better in the 1990s,' he says. 'Consumers worldwide will be frightened of spending the sort of money they spent in the 1980s. They will not be prepared to pay high prices and will look for value.' While unemployment remains high, Trinder feels governments will be forced to pursue Keynesian policies and spend money on infrastructure. 'Even where governments are in budget deficit, they will not cut back on capital projects,' he argues. 'Furthermore, low growth, low inflation and low interest rates will be conducive to capital formation.' As a result, Trinder believes the margins of consumer companies will fall, while those of capital goods companies will rise. So far Trinder's methods have been successful. The British Growth trust is fourth (out of 116 funds) in the UK Equity Growth sector, with a return of 111.86 per cent (offer-to-bid with income reinvested. Source: Micropal). Over three years, the performance is also impressive, with growth of 68 per cent placing the fund 14th out of 136 funds. Only over the past year has the relative performance dropped, with British Growth placed 75th out of 144 funds (albeit still recording a healthy 36.8 per cent return). This, argues Trinder, is because of the outperformance of smaller companies since the start of 1993. The FT Small-Cap index rose 31.1 per cent between January 1 and September 10 and the FT-SE 100 Index was up 6.7 per cent. Trinder is unrepentant. 'If I went into smaller companies, I'd have to buy lots of them as the fund grew. The fund would lose its discipline.' He believes his focused strategy will enable him to beat the All-Share over the long run. Charges. The initial charge is 5.25 per cent and the annual charge is 1.5 per cent. For those buying the trust in Pep form, however, the initial charge is just 2 per cent; there are then exit charges of 3 per cent in year one, 2 per cent in year two and 1 per cent in year three. The bid-offer spread inside the Pep is 3.5 per cent; outside the Pep it is 6.49 per cent. The yield is 1.3 per cent - not a fund for income-seekers. Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000 or Pounds 50 for Peps.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: SecPac provisions leap to Dollars 2.6bn SECURITY PACIFIC, the loss-making Los Angeles-based bank that is being merged into the Bank of America, yesterday unveiled an 80.3 per cent leap in 1991 bad debt provisions, to Dollars 2.6bn. The bank also suffered a 74.6 per cent jump in 1991 loan write-offs, to Dollars 1.4bn. SecPac revealed, as expected, a 1991 loss of Dollars 774.5m, a sharp deterioration from the Dollars 161.3m net profit recorded in 1990. The bank's fourth-quarter loss was Dollars 409.2m, compared with a loss of Dollars 357.6m in the same period of 1990. Mr Robert Smith, the chairman of SecPac, blamed much of the deficit on the state of the California economy. He repeated a statement last week that Bank of America had advised him the losses would not affect the planned merger. On Wall street yesterday, SecPac's share price was marked  7/8 lower to Dollars 32 5/8 . Shawmut, another bank that yesterday reported a 1991 loss, saw its share price marked down by Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 9 7/8 . The Connecticut-based Shawmut, which last week abandoned merger talks with the Bank of Boston, lost Dollars 170.7m in 1991, against a Dollars 133m loss in 1990. The fourth quarter saw a tiny net profit of Dollars 2.4m, against a Dollars 215.7m loss in the last quarter of 1990. MR Ralph MacDonald, a co-head of global corporate finance at Bankers Trust, resigned unexpectedly yesterday. Mr George Vojta, the other co-head of the corporate finance business, was named a vice-chairman, while Mr Eugene Shanks was named president.</p>

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / International Bonds: Brussels' investment plans push EIB to centre-stage TO POLITICIANS, it means putting people back to work. To the capital markets, it means a greater demand for finance - and to other borrowers, particularly companies, it could mean higher borrowing costs. Last week, politicians in Brussels proposed huge extra investment in infrastructure projects across the European Community as a way of reviving the flagging economies of member states. They also tentatively suggested how such a package could be financed: through the European Investment Bank, the EC states' development bank, which is already the biggest borrower on the international capital markets. With considerable competition for funds expected in the international markets next year - in part from the states which are the EIB's shareholders  -any such programme would push up costs for all borrowers. EC states seem unwilling to fund new projects directly. With growing budget deficits to finance, and a widening gap between their current fiscal positions and what they would have to achieve to meet the Maastricht convergence criteria, the emphasis is on fiscal restraint. A desire to take the pressure off domestic bond markets - and to rebuild depleted reserves - has already driven a number of European sovereign borrowers into the international bond markets, and more are expected. That leaves the EIB holding centre-stage in any new growth programme, although its chairman, Mr Ernst-Gunther Broder, cautioned last week against expecting too much, too soon. For a start, he said, the EIB is putting more effort into its credit appraisal process: it no longer has the guarantees of member states to back it, and so is more aware of the need to avoid losses and build reserves. Also, the EIB typically lends only around a quarter of the amount needed for any project. It waits for projects to be brought to it, and expects them to be largely financed commercially first. So any pick-up in lending depends mainly on the promoters of particular projects. There are other reasons why the EIB's presence in the markets may not pick up dramatically. It is considering issuing guarantees to commercial banks to encourage them to lend in some cases, rather than lending directly itself, says Mr Broder. Bankers welcomed the idea last week: they currently have no exposure to the EIB, and would be happy to take on such a credit risk. Should the bank need to borrow more from the bond market, there is no theoretical limit to the amount it could raise, says Mr Broder. Its capital base was doubled in size at the beginning of last year, and most of this capital remains unused. Also, the EIB's AAA-rating and sovereign shareholders make it one of the top credits around. The effects of any sharp upturn in EIB borrowing are not easy to predict, either on the bank's own borrowing costs or those of other customers of the Eurobond market. That is partly due to the bank's borrowing strategy in the past. While other large borrowers have turned in recent years to ever-bigger bond issues, the EIB has remained close to its Euromarket roots: issuing smaller amounts in a range of currencies in deals often aimed at retail investors. Until two months ago, this was not surprising. The withholding tax privilege accorded to supranational agencies like the EIB by Italy made it cheaper to issue bonds to Italian investors. With the tax advantage now scrapped, that has changed. Two approaches are now possible. The EIB could continue with its opportunistic strategy, trying to keep borrowing costs as low as possible in the short term; or it could set out to establish bigger, benchmark issues in an attempt to build a new following among a wider range of institutional investors. It seems initially to be following the first route, reaching into a wider range of markets to find opportunities to borrow cheaply. The bank raised Dollars 200m in the US earlier this month, its first drawing under a Dollars 750m medium-term note facility, an EIB official says - its first venture into the domestic US market for some time. It is also looking at borrowing in a wider range of European currencies: the Belgian franc, the Luxembourg franc and the Dutch guilder are all under-used, the official says. All of this is to make up in part for the disruption of the Ecu market, which provided 18 per cent of the bank's new funds last year. However, the EIB adds that the Ecu could still be one of its most important currencies: 'It could easily come back. We think we could do something in the near future.' This apparent determination to follow its familiar borrowing strategy follows what the EIB says was something of a surprise this autumn: the loss of the withholding tax privilege has had only a small effect on its borrowing costs. A short-dated dollar issue launched last month cost only 'a few basis points' more than a similar issue in March, even though yield spreads in the market generally have widened. Should the bank change its mind and move into the US market, it could find itself paying much more. Its bonds would be priced against those of the World Bank, says one US banker: 'They haven't had to do that for a long time.' But if the bank stays in the Euromarkets, any extra borrowing would make life more difficult for other issuers. If a crunch develops, it will not be the EIB that is crowded out of the market. As one London banker says: 'There is going to be stiff competition for funds in 1993, there's no doubt about it. But the ones who will be squeezed out will be the corporates.'</p>

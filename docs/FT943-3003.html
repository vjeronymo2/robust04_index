			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Inventory growth falls US business inventories grew more slowly in July than expected, offering some evidence that the economy may be moving to a slower pace of growth without an abrupt downturn in output, George Graham writes from Washington. The Commerce Department said inventories rose by 0.3 per cent in July, the fourth month of increase in succession but a much slower rate than the average 0.7 per cent a month recorded in the second quarter. Most financial market economists had predicted they would continue at that rate. Although businesses have been increasing stockpiles this year, inventory-to-sales ratios have been very low. In July, inventories rose to represent 1.42 months of sales, still a level at which retail sales would be expected to feed through into new orders. At the same time, a regional survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia showed manufacturing activity continuing to expand this month, despite some signs of weakening in shorter delivery times and lower unfilled orders.</p>

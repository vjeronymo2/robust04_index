			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Quotation marks as received] </F>   [Text] Warsaw, May 4 -- Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy during a  Wednesday meeting with diplomats to mark the 203 anniversary of  the May 3rd constitution said that the "Polish parliament is  very actively trying to build and co-create, in concert with the  government and the president, solid Polish-foreign relations."  Oleksy said that democratic parliaments as the representatives  of societies bring nations closer together via their contacts."  He also invited diplomats to a Sejm debate devoted to Polish  foreign policy, which will take place on May 12.    Oleksy pointed out that the Polish "parliament, in its  international activity, is an important part of the state's  foreign policy and at the same time it implements this policy."  Oleksy stressed that the processes of market and democratic  reforms in Poland will be continued irrevocably and added that  there is a political agreement on this matter.    "Poland has chosen a decisive Euro-Atlantic course in which  she sees its strategic security and interests," stated Oleksy  and added that this, however, does not lead to the restriction  of Poland's strivings for building good relations with  extra-European countries."    Dean of the diplomatc corps Papal Nuncio Archbishop Jozef  Kowalczyk wished that parliamentarians adopt a constitution  which would meet the expectations of the entire modern society  ... and which would grow to be an inspiration for other  generations and people, as the May 3rd contitution had once  been."</p>

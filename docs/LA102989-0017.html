			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENDPAPERS: WOMEN SLEUTHS AND THE RISE OF THE WHYDUNIT  </P> <P> The tidings at this year's Bouchercon, a recently concluded annual encampment  of mystery writers and mystery lovers, was not simply that the mystery field is  burgeoning (nearly 1,500 titles in 1988, according to a tabulation by the Drood  Review of Mystery in Boston). The news within the news, so to speak, was that  women are not only writing mysteries, they are writing mysteries with female  protagonists.  </P> <P> In his history of crime fiction, "Mortal Consequences," Julian Symons  identifies Ann Katharine Green as the first American woman to write a detective  novel, "The Leavenworth Case," in 1878. Green's father was a criminal attorney  and her research was near at hand. Among the English pioneers was F. Tennyson  Jesse, a grandniece of Lord Alfred. She wrote a series of stories about an  amateur detector named Solange Fontaine.  </P> <P> In modern times, women have had an importance in the field quite  disproportionate to their numbers. Any popularity poll of mystery writers in  the 20th Century would surely put Agatha Christie at the top, with Dorothy L.  Sayers, Margery Allingham, Josephine Tey and Ngaio Marsh high on the list. P.  D. James, Ruth Rendell, Martha Grimes, Amanda Cross, Antonia Fraser, Dorothy  Salisbury Davis (honored here at Bouchercon) and Mary Higgins Clark might lead  a list of active writers.  </P> <P> Yet in the reading if not in the writing, the mystery was taken to be a man's  game. Although she later invented Jane Marple and the husband-and-wife team of  Tommy and Tuppence Beresford, Agatha Christie established her fame and her  readership with Hercule Poirot (whom she later found exasperatingly tiresome).  Sayers' creature was the archly mannered Lord Peter Wimsey, and while his wife  Harriet Vane received increasing attention and was by no means a stereotyped,  reactive figure, the series was essentially all Wimsey. Allingham spent more  than 30 years with the deceptively vacuous Albert Campion (now emerging on  television). Ngaio Marsh's man was Roderick (Rory) Alleyn. P. D. James  generally writes about Adam Dalgliesh, with just one outing thus far for a  woman, Cordelia Gray, in "An Unsuitable Job for a Woman."  </P> <P> Rendell's series characters are Inspector Wexford and his sidekick Mike Burden.  Grimes has given us Richard Jury. And so it has gone.  </P> <P> But the job is no longer thought unsuitable for women. In England, Amanda  Fraser broke the pattern decisively with her Jemima Shore, a television  personality who is an inadvertent sleuth but a clever one and who is as well  the very model of the liberated woman, with a married lover to whom she is not  subservient.  </P> <P> Now the United States, where Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler established  a whole genre, has a commanding lead in generating a new genre, or a co-genre,  in which remarkable, non-traditional women, often professional private eyes,  work as crime-solvers in a style and milieu about as far as you can get from  Nancy Drew.  </P> <P> The nearest Drew equivalent, though only in the limited sense of being a  well-mannered lady, would have to be Amanda Cross' Prof. Kate Fansler, an  academic whose work-life presumably echoes that of Carolyn Heilbrun, the  Columbia professor for whom Cross is the nom-de-crime.  </P> <P> Nancy Pickard's Jennifer Cain is not a private eye but runs a civic foundation  in a small Eastern city, a position from which she has no trouble stumbling  onto greedy developers and other wellsprings of crime.  </P> <P> But Fansler and Cain are anomalies. The new norm is the female private eye who,  without sacrificing sensitivity, is in many details quite the same as her male  forebears. The incomes tend to range from low to non-existent (one sleeps on  the floor of her office). The investigating ladies endure many a beating, and  they are as familiar with the dark, mean streets as ever Philip Marlowe or Sam  Spade was. Above all, they are no less dedicated to discovering truth and  seeing justice done, whether within the law or outside it.  </P> <P> Sara Paretsky's V. I. Warshawkski was once a lawyer in the public defender's  office. She is now a Chicago PI (private investigator, of course) whose cases  run a gamut of hot social issues, from industrial pollution to incompetent  medicine.  </P> <P> At a panel discussion called "After Equality -- What?," Paretsky, who began  writing after she earned a Ph.D. at the University of Chicago, said: "I'm sick  of our being called women writers instead of just writers."  </P> <P> She was asked if the new fictional women were too tough. " 'Are the women  tough?' is a tough question," Paretsky said. "I've been re-reading all of  Chandler. Marlowe is so alone. I. V. has connections. She can be weak and  wounded and need help. In our society, tough means you're alone, and when you  think about it, that's pretty sick."  </P> <P> Sue Grafton of Santa Barbara writes about Kinsey Millhone, a private eye who  first appeared in " 'A' Is for Alibi" in 1982 and has been working her way  through the alphabet. Millhone could have had coffee with Ross Macdonald's Lew  Archer, so similar is their milieu and the kind of personal, impassioned crime  they encounter.  </P> <P> Marcia Muller's Sharon McCone is a private investigator for a San Francisco law  firm. Somewhat less well-defined than Millhone so far, she is a comparable  mixture of sensibility and toughness and her detecting is not done from an  armchair.  </P> <P> Now as always, there seems no more fertile turf for the private eye than  California. During Bouchercon, St. Martin's Press and the Private Eye Writers  of America presented the fourth Best First Private Eye Novel award -- $10,000  and publication by St. Martin's. It went -- for the fourth time -- to a  Californian, Gar Anthony Haywood, whose "Fear of the Dark" will be published  next year. The third winner, Karen Kijewski, is a former English teacher now  tending bar in Citrus Heights to support her writing habit. Her heroine in the  recently published "Walk" is Kat Colorado, a PI specializing in the corporate  jungle, where she takes many a hard knock.  </P> <P> A well-reviewed 1988 novel was "Donato &amp; Daughter" by Jack Early, about a  weary NYPD detective who is outranked by and alienated from his daughter, an  NYPD lieutenant. "Early," it was disclosed at Bouchercon, was in fact Sandra  Scoppettone, who thought the pseudonym went better with a first-person male  narrator. Her next book, Scoppettone told an audience, will be under her own  byline and feature a lesbian detective. The dominance of male characters in  crime fiction is eroding fast.  </P> <P> The changing patterns in crime fiction are nicely symbolized by a new group  called Sisters in Crime, which took form at a breakfast meeting at Bouchercon  three years ago and now has 400 members, from writers to publishers. Organized  by Sara Paretsky, the group agitates for equal review space for women writers  (a sore point) and against gratuitous violence toward women in mysteries and  all other fiction forms.  </P> <P> The organization tabulated three years of crime-novel reviews in the New York  Times and found only 14% of the books were by women. The Drood Review of  Mystery made its own count of the 1988 mystery output. The journal found that  of 1,487 titles published (or which came to their attention), 1,065 were  written by men, 358 by women (a few others were by mixed teams or authors not  identifiable by gender). The 3-1 ratio turned out to be the same ratio in which  Drood itself reviewed books by men and women.  </P> <P> (A rough count of the reviews in 24 monthly editions of "Bloody Sunday" in this  newspaper showed the same ratio, 131 books by men, 45 by women, just about 3 to  1.)  </P> <P> Why women should have such an affinity to mysteries as both readers and writers  is a lively question. Prof. B. J. Rahn of Hunter College, who teaches a course  in crime fiction by women and who conducted a penetrating interview with Ruth  Rendell at Bouchercon, noted some of the possible answers in a recent magazine  piece.  </P> <P> "Women," Rahn said in an interview, "are way out in front when it comes to the  whydunit." They are themselves sensitive, she said, and they have insights into  the deep emotions that can lead to acts of sudden rage or slow revenge.  </P> <P> P. D. James, Rahn wrote, has observed that women "have a keen eye for the  commonplace details used in constructing clues and spotting inconsistencies in  suspects' stories."  </P> <P> That women do the most reading is no surprise, says Rahn. "It's been that way  for 200 years. They had the leisure to read. The novel was written for them,  and of course the novel was not then thought to be real literature."  </P> <P> It also may be that the leisure to write (or the traditional inability to find  satisfying work in a male-dominated world) helped initially to explain the  presence and the prestige of women in crime fiction.  </P> <P> In the postwar years, Rahn has concluded, women have pioneered in the whydunit,  taking the mystery from an intricate puzzle to a full-blown novel. "They have  mastered the form with ease, wit and charm."  </P> <P> Bouchercon, named after the late mystery writer-critic-anthologist Anthony  Boucher, who preferred the name to his own William Anthony Parker White, this  year had as honored guests Simon Brett, Ruth Rendell, Dorothy Salisbury Davis,  the veteran editor Joan Kahn and H. R. F. Keating. The film of Keating's  Inspector Ghote novel, "The Perfect Murder," was shown. It has no American  distribution, although with all else it is a vivid look at present-day Bombay.  This year's event, the 20th, drew about 250 writers, of whom half were women,  and 750 fans, the clear majority of them women, as if to confirm tangibly what  the surveys have been showing.  </P> <P> At the panel on "After Equality -- What?" the participants agreed that crime  fiction still was regarded as an inferior, stepchild literary form. Did they  care? Panelists and audience in unison shouted a reverberating "No!"  </P></p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: India reins back its sugar exports THE Indian government has decided for the moment not to export the full 525,000 tonnes of sugar which it sanctioned last month. Even though there is a huge surplus, the caretaker government headed by Mr Chandra Shekhar has accepted the industry's suggestion to restrict the export to 225,000 tonnes for the time being. The decision to withhold export has been taken in view of the prevailing depressed sugar price in the world market, according to Mr Om Dhanuka, spokesman for the Indian Sugar Mills Association. The Indian Sugar and General Industry Export Import Corporation, the trading arm of the industry, is still looking for buyers for 50,000 unsold tonnes out of the 225,000 tonnes. Whether India will finally export 525,000 tonnes will be decided by the new government to be formed following the elections later this month. The Indian sugar industry had produced 10.04m tonnes of sugar by mid-April, compared with 9.12m tonnes in the corresponding period last season. Experts believe total production in the current season, ending September, could be 12m tonnes, against actual production of 11m tonnes last year. If production touches 12m tonnes, the total availability in the current season will be 14.2m tonnes, when brought-forward stocks are included. Domestic demand will at the most be 10.6m tonnes. When the industry's stock was taken recently, it was found that 328 mills were still engaged in cane crushing as on April 15 last, against 289 mills on the corresponding day of the previous season. Mr Dhanuka said: 'There is still plenty of cane in the field and a good number of mills in north and west India will remain operational till June when monsoon sets in full might.' India's cane production in 1990-91 is estimated at 233.45m tonnes, compared with 222.62m tonnes last year.</p>

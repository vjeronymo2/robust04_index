			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRISONERS CON THE LONELY WITH HUGE PEN PAL SCAMS  </P> <P> David Paul Hammer was a prisoner at Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester a  few years ago when he bragged to a reporter for an alternative magazine that he  had received at least $176,000 from 1,500 to 2,000 people he had duped into  sending him money.  </P> <P> "The trick is making them fall in love with you through letters and on the  phone," Hammer told the Los Angeles-based magazine, the Advocate. "And I mean  people who are lonely are so willing and vulnerable because they're reaching  out and they're wanting something."  </P> <P> Across the country, prisoners' ploys to acquire and psychologically manipulate  pen pals -- frequently homosexual men -- have resulted in the loss of millions  of dollars and countless broken dreams over the past 15 years, authorities say.  </P> <P> But now, the stakes have risen as pen pal scams have figured in the murders of  four gay men, three in Mississippi and one in New York, who had been writing to  the murder suspects when they were behind bars.  </P> <P> On Sunday in San Clemente, former Indiana inmate Keith Eugene Goodman and two  associates were arrested in separate SWAT team raids on suspicion of stalking  Goodman's prison pen pals and killing them after committing robberies.  </P> <P> Goodman, 30, walked out of state prison with thousands of dollars from pen pals  whom he had apparently persuaded to send money, said New York State Police  investigator Richard J. Kadien.  </P> <P> One of Goodman's suspected victims, Harold Williams, 60, found shot to death  Dec. 17 in his Upstate New York home, had apparently paid a $500 phone bill  accumulated answering collect calls from Goodman. He had also sent Goodman a  total of $300 while they wrote each other.  </P> <P> For long-term, maximum security inmates with time on their hands and nothing to  lose, "scamming" outsiders is probably the most popular and lucrative of all  prison "businesses," including the sale of illegal drugs, said Annette Viator,  chief legal counsel for the Louisiana Department of Corrections.  </P> <P> Investigators have conservatively estimated that 10% of the 5,500 inmates at  Angola Penitentiary in Louisiana, with or without outside contacts, have taken  in more than $1 million in a recent three-year period.  </P> <P> Homosexuals, sometimes vulnerable to blackmail and unlikely to file complaints,  are the primary target of such scams, she said, followed by religious people  who want to help the less fortunate, and lonely subscribers to singles  magazines carrying personal ads.  </P> <P> Some inmates also subscribe to metropolitan newspapers to contact people listed  in divorce or real estate transactions. "Inmates who are truly looking to scam  a large number of people leave no stone unturned for a source," Viator said.  </P> <P> Typical victims include a 67-year-old Orange County widow who spent $3,000 and  sold her home to bankroll a prisoner who said he needed to pay off legal fees,  according to Viator. In Canada, a homosexual high-ranking aide to a Canadian  Parliament official lost $30,000 to pen pals who blackmailed him, then informed  his boss about his homosexuality anyway.  </P> <P> Viator said that many people are surprised to learn that the dupes are often  intelligent professionals. "They're not stupid. They're just very trusting."  </P> <P> The cons are "chameleons," she said. "It's amazing how they know how to fit  their identify to a person who needs them. If you're a homosexual, they'll say,  'So am I.' If you're a lonely old man, they'll say, 'I'm a young girl who never  had a family.' "  </P> <P> For example, an ad reading "Be My Summer Lover," placed last year in the  Advocate, was signed only "Eddie." An established Santa Cruz professional, just  jilted by his gay lover, picked up the magazine and replied. It resulted, he  said, in an emotional and financial nightmare.  </P> <P> As the man found out later, after voluntarily sending "Eddie" $17,200, his pen  pal was not the "cuddly, shy" 23-year-old Texan he claimed to be. Instead he  was a 43-year-old convicted murderer, spending his time in a Louisiana prison  bilking money from emotionally vulnerable people.  </P> <P> "Often minorities feel we're all in this together," said the 55-year-old Santa  Cruz man who asked not to be identified. "Here was this gay young man. I'm gay.  When (one feels) the majority is out to get you, minorities protect one  another. I adopted a father or protector role.  </P> <P> "I started out sending him money to get out of trouble, to get him out here to  California, then to post bonds as he kept getting in 'trouble.'  </P> <P> "By the time I realized I had no more money, I had borrowed up to the hilt."  </P> <P> A lawyer he had contacted to help "Eddie" instead made him realize that he had  been duped. After the initial embarrassment, he said, he was relieved. "What I  could not handle was thinking that this kid is going to go to prison and get  raped because I couldn't help him anymore."  </P> <P> The man now has a civil suit pending against "Eddie."  </P> <P> Viator says the scams are difficult to stop, partly because overburdened and  under-funded prosecutors are unwilling to spend time and money to charge and  try prisoners already serving life sentences.  </P> <P> In addition, authorities cited the relative ease of raising bogus money orders  -- the nation's single-largest prison scam.  </P> <P> One scheme known to investigators as the Parchman Money Order Scam has waxed  and waned at the Mississippi Penitentiary in Parchman for 15 years, said Mike  Hesse, Memphis, Tenn., postal inspector whose jurisdiction includes the prison.  </P> <P> In 1987, about 60 prisoners there were involved in a bogus money order scheme  soliciting pen pals through personal ads in magazines.  </P> <P> Typically, authorities said, an inmate writes to his victim saying he is in  prison because he made a mistake, is serving a short jail sentence and is  financially secure. Then the letters become more intimate with the inmate  asking for the pen-pal's phone number and starting to call collect.  </P> <P> Usually, the prisoner will talk about relocating near the victim to begin a  sincere relationship and then send his pen pal a $1 or $5 money order, altered  in the prison press shop to read $100 or $500. Believing the prisoner to be an  innocent victim, needing money for attorney fees or other reasons, the pen pals  will help smuggle the cash in.  </P> <P> Once the inmate feels he has bilked the victims as long as he can, the  relationship is ended.  </P> <P> In 1985, postal investigators found more than 3,500 money orders at the  Mississippi prison with an altered value of $1.6 million. In 1989, the value  was $1.4 million, of which $400,000 was recovered -- from the victims  themselves.  </P> <P> Brian Kennedy, Los Angeles area director of Prison Fellowship Ministries, a  Christian organization founded by Watergate figure Charles Colson, said he  warns many well-meaning pen pal volunteers against giving their addresses to  prisoners.  </P> <P> A recent episode of the comedy television show "Golden Girls" dealt with a  surprise visit from a prison pen pal with whom one of the women characters had  carried on a torrid correspondence, figuring that he was safely guarded. Such  episodes can occur in real life and are far from funny, authorities say.  </P> <P> Kennedy said that some prisoners "prey on well-meaning volunteers to do a  number of things -- to get them money, to do special favors, make contacts in  the community for them, send in special items for them. Sometimes they  intimidate the volunteer. 'If you don't do what I ask you, I'll do this or  that, hurt your family.' It's rare, but it happens."  </P> <P> Kennedy said he trains pen pals to communicate clearly that they want nothing  more than a friendly relationship by mail and not to respond to sexual  propositions.  </P> <P> The most vulnerable are gullible people who think they understand an inmate's  mentality, he said. "I'm real scared for people like that," he said.  </P> <P> The Advocate accepts personal ads from prisoners but also prints periodic  warnings against bogus ads and scams.  </P> <P> On the other hand, some prisoners complain about pen pals writing them, then  cutting off contact abruptly, said Mike Riegle, office manager for the Gay  Community News, an 8,000-circulation publication that goes to 600 prisoners and  carries a Prisoners Seeking Friends column.  </P> <P> Despite negative experiences, he encourages prison correspondence. "Any kind of  contact they can maintain to make them feel like a human being is crucial,"  said Riegle.  </P> <P> In some cases, authorities have transferred scammers to other prisons in an  attempt to break up gangs, but attempts to stop scams have had spotty results.  </P> <P> At Parchman, prison officials agreed to take away conjugal visits of scammers  and place them in a special lockup, Hesse said. "The money order problem went  down to zero." But inmates petitioned a federal court in Jackson, Miss.,  claiming that they were receiving punishment without being charged with a  crime.  </P> <P> When officials could not prove their claims, they were forced to release them  and the problem "skyrocketed," Hesse said.  </P> <P> Viator said the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office have also investigated the  scams, but no charges have resulted.  </P> <P> In an attempt to crush the scams, Angola last year initiated a so-called Scam  Tier -- a special row for inmates convicted by an in-house review board of  scamming. On the row, the only communications they are allowed are monitored by  prison officials.  </P> <P> Nearly all the 20 inmates on Scam Tier have joined a class-action suit, now  pending before a federal judge, claiming that the privacy of their  attorney-client relationships has been violated.  </P> <P> Though a lower court magistrate has already ruled in favor of the inmates,  Viator said she is not fighting a losing battle.  </P> <P> "If we lose, I'll take it to the court of appeals. Even though the right to  attorney-client privilege is important, other things can outweigh it."  </P> <P> CRY FOR HELP -- Suspect's desperate phone call helped break murder case. A25  </P></p>

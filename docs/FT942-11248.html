			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Receivers sell off Lancer Boss: Deal with Jungheinrich of Germany secures 700 UK jobs The future of Lancer Boss was finally resolved when administrative receivers to the last big UK-owned producer of lift trucks yesterday announced they had sold the business to Germany's Jungheinrich. The deal, which was welcomed by managers and employees at Boss, ends one of the most extraordinary receiverships in UK corporate history. It secures the future of 700 jobs at Boss factories in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire. Terms were not disclosed, but it is understood Jungheinrich paid about Pounds 18m, excluding debtors, for the Lancer Boss Group and associated companies in the UK, Ireland and Austria. The deal follows intense negotiations involving Grant Thornton, the accountants who were appointed administrative receivers on April 8, and the three bidders. Jungheinrich, based in Hamburg, was persuaded to raise its bid 'very significantly', outbidding Terex of the US and a proposed management buy-in. Mr Allan Griffiths, a partner at Grant Thornton and one of the administrative receivers, said the price paid by Jungheinrich was 'at the very top end of our estimates'. He would not say how much Boss's banks, led by National Westminster, would receive, but said they were pleased with the deal. Lancer Boss called in the receivers after German banks withdrew support from Steinbock Boss, the UK company's big German unit, prompting it to call in a German receiver. The case quickly highlighted the difficulties of selling a group with borrowings and operations in different European countries when there are no standard European insolvency rules. Mr Griffiths said yesterday that there would have been more international interest in Lancer Boss if he had been able to sell the UK and German sides of the business together. Jungheinrich bought Steinbock Boss from its German receiver on April 14. Mr Griffiths warned that a split receivership could occur again, especially with medium-sized UK companies whose European operations were financed locally, and said he would be sending a report to the Department of Trade and Industry on the lessons learned from the affair. Jungheinrich was considered the leading contender for Lancer Boss after its purchase of Steinbock Boss. Mr Bob Bischof, chairman of Jungheinrich (GB), defended his company's role in the affair against industry accusations of a 'conspiracy' against Lancer Boss. He claimed the combined price paid by Jungheinrich for Lancer Boss and Steinbock Boss was virtually the same as it had offered before the receivership.

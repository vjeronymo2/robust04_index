			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / International Company News: Bancario San Paolo in operational shake-up ITALY'S banking sector could be set for further rationalisation with signs that Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, the country's biggest bank in terms of assets, may merge operations of its two big regional banking subsidiaries into the parent. The news comes with an admission by the bank, which floated 20 per cent of its shares last year, that it is also considering changing its articles of association to allow a majority of its equity to be listed. San Paolo is one of six big Italian banks, formally owned by charitable institutions, which are closely associated with the public sector. So far, only two have listed their shares, and none has gone beyond floating a minority of its equity capital. The bank's board last week took the first step to incorporating its big Banco Lariano and Banca Provinciale Lombarda subsidiaries by commissioning a study to consider the effects of their merger with the parent company. The move has been mooted before, but it is the first time the bank has taken firm action to pursue it further. Banco Lariano, based in Como and 85 per cent owned by San Paolo, has assets of L18,805bn (Dollars 12.6bn). Assets of Bergamo-based Banca Provinciale Lombarda, which is 70 per cent owned, totalled L17,397bn at end-1992. San Paolo itself has total assets of L150,613bn. Incorporation of the subsidiaries could provide considerable tax and cost savings. However, the move has always been rejected on the grounds that it would risk alienating clients.</p>

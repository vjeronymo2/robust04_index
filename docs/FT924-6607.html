			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Wassall expects gearing to rise above 50% if bid is successful WASSALL, the mini-conglomerate run by former Hanson executives, expects its gearing to rise to above 50 per cent if it wins its Pounds 94.3m hostile bid for Evode, the chemical and plastics group. Although its intends to finance the offer through a rights issue, which will raise Pounds 103m, Wassall said it might have to pay a further Dollars 43m (Pounds 28.4m) for Evode's unlisted redeemable preference shares. Wassall has offered 80p in cash for every Evode ordinary share, valuing the ordinary capital at Pounds 58.2m. There is a share alternative on the basis of one Wassall ordinary for every 180p being paid to a maximum of 16.2m shares. The preference shares are held by US West, one of the US 'baby Bell' telecommunication companies and GE Capital, an investment subsidiary of General Electric, the diversified US holding company. The two companies have the right to ask for immediate repayment on a change of Evode's ownership. Mr Christopher Miller, Wassall's chief executive, said that since the unlisted preference shares have a high coupon of 13 per cent, US West and GE Capital may not want to force repayment. The shares can be redeemed from 1996. Nonetheless, Wassall has 'facilities in place' to repay the Dollars 43m if it wins control of Evode. It also estimates that Evode has bank debt of about Pounds 35m. Mr Andrew Simon, Evode's chairman, would not disclose the company's debt, but said it had substantial borrowing facilities which were more than enough to fund its needs. Mr Miller retorted: 'Is it prudent for Evode to be borrowing more. How will they repay that debt?' Mr Simon said: 'I take grave exception that Wassall made no effort to contact me before the morning of the offer and then did not even ask for a meeting.'</p>

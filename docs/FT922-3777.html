			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / International Company News: S Africa banks cautious on UK THE ANNOUNCEMENT by the South African Standard Bank group that it has obtained a UK banking licence will not necessarily lead to a flood of similar applications from other South African banks. Although the banking community is enjoying the greater business freedom allowed by the country's political rehabilitation, the new possibilities this opens up are being assessed cautiously. Mr Piet Badenhorst, chief executive of ABSA, South Africa's largest banking group, is known to be of the view that obtaining a banking licence in London is not a high priority. An ABSA spokesman says London is a very crowded market, and also one perceived as being heavily controlled by the status quo in the City. He says an ABSA operation there is still some way off. The group's sheer size, however, may hasten the process. Mr Badenhorst said at a recent presentation that they were attracting new corporate clients because of their size, and because corporations wanted to spread their exposure. If these clients required an overseas service, ABSA would clearly provide it. Mr Viv Bartlett, senior general manager at First National Bank (FNB), said they were examining options in relation to London and would be making a decision 'in the not too distant future'. He said the primary focus of offshore operations would be in assisting corporate investors with their trade-flows and foreign exchange dealing operations. Mr Bartlett said obtaining a UK banking licence - the one issued to Standard was the first to a South African bank since 1985 - should not be a problem. 'Since the political changes, the signals out of London have been that we would be warmly received.' Mr Bartlett said an application was being processed for an FNB branch in Zurich, while they were submitting an application for a separate deposit taking company licence in Hong Kong. A disincentive to making a 'bricks and mortar' investment abroad is the high cost because offshore purchases have to be financed through the financial rand mechanism. No Nedcor Bank spokesman was available for comment.</p>

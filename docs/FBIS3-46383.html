			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "A Central Leader Says Competition Should Be </F> Introduced to Foreign Trade to Break Monopoly"]    [Text] Beijing, 22 Jan (TA KUNG PAO)--A central leader  recently said that monopolies in foreign trade should be  replaced with competition. This year, the problem of unfair  competition between foreign trade enterprises should be solved.  In the future, individuals will be allowed to engage in foreign  trade, but this cannot be effected for the time being.    The leader said that there is no overheating in foreign  trade. As long as the market exists and goods can be sold at a  good profit, the more are sold, the better. Reform in the  foreign trade system will break monopolies and decentralize  management power. In 1988, provincial trade companies received  foreign trade powers. In 1990, the problem of unequal  competition between localities was solved. In 1994, the problem  of unequal competition between enterprises should be solved.  Foreign trade should move from monopoly to competition. Export  subsidies should be stopped. As a result, China's foreign trade  will rank in a more advanced position in the world. Finally,  foreign trade will be conducted by business groups, and small  foreign trade companies are just transitional forms. Eventually,  there will be a number of large corporations, like those in  Japan.    The leader said that conditions should be created for an  export agency system. Foreign trade companies should be  gradually turned into productive enterprises with fixed bases.  Action should be started from improving the variety of  products, and the integration of foreign trade with industrial  and agricultural production should be promoted. Some people  asked why individuals are not allowed to engage in foreign  trade. This may be effected in the future, but this is still  impossible for the time being. Joint-stock companies with  shares held by workers inside enterprises can be established,  because this is an effective way to invigorate state-owned  foreign trade enterprises.</p>

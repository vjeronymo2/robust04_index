			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (18): A mutually beneficial link with China / Profile of Hierro Peru A STUNNED silence descended on the makeshift auction room in Lima's mines ministry when privatisation officials announced the winning bid for Hierro Peru, the ailing iron producer, last November. The Shougang Corporation of the People's Republic of China had offered almost six times the base price. Adding in long-standing company debts and a Dollars 150m investment commitment, the Chinese were paying about Dollars 312m for an operation most observers considered ready for the scrap-heap. Reactions varied from the incredulity of rival bidders (a consortium of prominent Chilean, Japanese and Mexican steel producers) to the nervousness of Peruvian economic liberals. It was hardly appropriate, they felt, for the first big sell-off to go to communist buyers. Others were convinced that the Chinese had got their sums wrong, and had failed to appreciate the disastrous state of the company. 'Absolutely untrue,' says a senior Shougang official. 'We knew exactly what we were buying, all the problems. It was a question of opportunity cost. China needs iron and here we could buy a deposit with huge reserves and an immediate outlet to the sea. Few iron mines in the world can compare with Marcona.' Now, nine months after taking control of their new investment, Shougang managers are happy. A Dollars 35m loss in 1992 has already turned into a small profit. Output in the first half of 1993 was two and a half times higher than the same period last year, although, at 2.43m long tons of concentrate, still well below current installed capacity. Productivity figures have improved sharply - from 156 tonnes per worker per month last year to 325 tonnes now. Production costs have been slashed by 60 per cent in six months, partly as a result of workforce reductions - from 3,300 to 1,700. Shipments are leaving on time. Equipment and administrative systems are being overhauled. It is a sharp about-turn in Hierro Peru's fortunes. From 1953 until its expropriation by the Peruvian state in 1972, the rich deposits were the property of the US-owned Marcona Mining Company. Since then, under first military, then civilian governments, output and installed capacity both inexorably declined. Output peaked in 1970, when 9.7m tonnes of concentrates were produced, mostly shipped to Asian buyers. By 1990, it had slumped by more than two-thirds. Shougang has already embarked on new investment - in the second half of 1993 it will top Dollars 37m. Much will go on new shovels and drills for the mine, rebuilding stocks of essential spare parts and a modern communications system. Wharf facilities at the deep water port of San Nicolas (one of the best on the Pacific coast of Latin America, and an important company asset) are being upgraded. Future plans are ambitious. They include raising output to 5m long tons this year, to 7.5m next year; 10m by 1995. Total investment of around Dollars 150m will be needed to expand current installed capacity. Low-profile company officials are reluctant to reveal longer-term plans, although there is talk of constructing a steel plant on site and, later, a factory to manufacture Chinese-designed tractors for export to other Latin American countries. Shougang could also be interested in buying Siderperu, the state-owned steelworks and, eventually, developing the country's other big iron deposits of Huancabamba, in the eastern jungle. There is good news, too, on the labour front. Workers who survived the swingeing job cuts appear to have adapted swiftly to their new Chinese managers. 'After the long, no-hope years of falling production, we're glad to be in work,' said one local miner. Colleagues agreed, praising initiatives such as a new consumer co-operative which offers basic goods to workers at cost. Shougang seems bent on bringing self-sufficiency to the 23,000-inhabitant community of San Juan de Marcona, off the beaten track and traditionally dependent on the Hierro Peru operation. Two small trawlers have been imported from China to provide fresh fish for locals and agricultural and livestock projects are under way. Company officials say these small beginnings could lead to export ventures in fishmeal (China is Peru's big customer) and agro-industrial products, probably asparagus. At present, all the evidence suggests that the Shougang venture is a success for both Peru and its Chinese purchasers. 'We're really just like any Western industrial company in that we want to make profits,' says a senior Shougang official. 'But perhaps our great respect for our human resources is a peculiarity. It is certainly fundamental for Shougang.'</p>

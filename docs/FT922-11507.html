			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: American Barrick improves 49% AMERICAN Barrick, the Toronto-based gold producer, has credited active hedging and rising output from its flagship Goldstrike mine in Nevada for a 49 per cent jump in first-quarter earnings. In spite of the sagging bullion price, Barrick lifted earnings to USDollars 23.2m, or 16 cents a share, from Dollars 15.6m, or 11 cents, in the first quarter of 1991. Revenues climbed to Dollars 81.5m from Dollars 73m. The company said that it was raising its annual dividend to 13 cents a share from 11 cents. Barrick has hedged its output until the end of 1994 at an average price of Dollars 425 an ounce. This was the price it received in the first quarter, in spite of the average Comex price of Dollars 351. Production from the five mines in which Barrick has an interest grew to 202,505 ounces from 171,980 ounces. Almost the entire increase was due to a 38 per cent rise in output from Goldstrike. Barrick said that Goldstrike's production would continue to rise in the second half. It expects total 1992 output to be about 1.2m ounces.</p>

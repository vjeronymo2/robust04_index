			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, Jan 26 (AFP) -- The UN's deputy disarmament  chief on Wednesday wound up a "very productive" mission here to  discuss long term monitoring of Iraq's weapons programme.    American Charles Duelfer, deputy head of the UN Special  Commission (UNSCOM) disarming Iraq under Gulf War ceasefire  resolutions, spent five days here preparing next week's visit by  his boss Rolf Ekeus.    "The discussions have been very productive" on implementing  Security Council Resolution 715, which orders long term  monitoring of Iraq's weapons programme, Duelfer said as he left  for New York via Cyprus.    The surveillance programme is the next UN step following the  destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction after the Gulf  war of January-February 1991.    Ekeus arrives next Wednesday to discuss long-term  monitoring,  but has said he is unlikely to recommend a lifting of sanctions  before the end of the year.    Iraq has been lobbying hard for an end to the embargo  imposed  after the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.    Duelfer had talks with General 'Amr Rashid, head of the  military industrialisation organisation, and visited several  military sites.    Setting up the monitoring "is a complicated procedure which  will require the sustained efforts of both the government of  Iraq and UNSCOM" he said.    "Iraq has provided additional detailed information on  facilities which we are evaluating."    His talks here covered details of the monitoring, including  inspections, sensors and cameras.    Iraq agreed to the surveillance in November after rejecting  it for three years.    "Significant progress has beenb made and much remains to be  done" Duelfer added.    A team of 16 inspectors led by Russian Nikita Smidovitch  arrived with Duelfer on Friday for a 10 day inspection mission.</p>

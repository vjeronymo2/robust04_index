			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Letter: Budget - impressive conjuring trick and real PEP picture (1) Sir, Norman Lamont must be congratulated on the skill with which he has increased the effective burden of tax on corporate dividends while presenting his proposals as a possible 'solution' to the problems of Advance Corporation Tax for which the Confederation of British Industry and others have lobbied hard and long. His two proposals are: (a) to reduce the rate of ACT from 25 per cent to 22.5 per cent from April 5 1993 and 20 per cent from April 5 1994; and (b) to introduce a scheme for 'foreign income dividends' (FID) whereby dividends can be paid effectively without ACT if they are paid out of foreign income on which no UK corporation tax is paid. These proposals are described as giving the corporate sector a cash flow benefit of Pounds 2bn, reducing the surplus ACT problem by Pounds 300m and at the same time raising revenue from 1995-96 onwards by Pounds 1bn. It would be good news indeed if such benefits arise. A closer examination, however, reveals that it is not that easy. By reducing the rate of ACT which can be recovered from the company's own liability to corporation tax this stroke of the pen reduces the gross income of the shareholders and, if the shareholders insist on their income being restored by payment of higher dividends, the Pounds 2bn of cash flow benefits will disappear and reappear as a Pounds 1bn cost. Commonsense would seem to indicate that the market will downgrade companies which do not make up the difference. Much the same point can be made about the FID proposal. A company paying an FID can claim back the ACT paid on the FID but the recipient shareholder will get no credit. The pension and other exempt funds which dominate the market can now recover this credit. They will not appreciate companies which pay FIDs unless additional dividends are paid to make up the lost credit. In this event the benefits of paying FIDs disappear. These are impressive conjuring tricks. The truth is that by reducing the rate of ACT by 5 per cent the chancellor has increased the tax on shareholders and their companies by the same amount. He has reduced the amount of the company's tax liability that can be used as a credit by the shareholders. It is all done by mirrors.

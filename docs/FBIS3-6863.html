Vietnam's state bank governor welcomed the idea during Wichit's  visit to the country last week.    Wichit Suphinit, central bank governor, said Vietnam banks  are specialized in industries and lack financial expertise to  cope with international investors flooding into the country.    Its specialist banks are involved with foreign trade,  industrial development, construction and agriculture.    The Thai central bank must first help Vietnam convert its  banks into commercial facilities through the four-year training  programmes it is offering the country's financial sector, said  Wichit. Upcoming commercial banks will then be able to institute  local and foreign loans to help bolster the country's economy,  he added.    Under the programmes, Thailand will receive Vietnamese  banking officials for training in finance and stock market  development.    Vietnamese banks will be assisted in drafting banking  regulations for loans, cheque clearing, promissory note  issuance, bond issuance, loan repayments and share certificate  transactions, said Wichit.    The programmes will also address bankruptcy law, he added.    Wichit does not foresee Vietnamese banks as a threat to  Thailand's finance sector once they acquire commercial exposure.    "Thai banks still have to accomplish many things for further  development. For example, our form filings have to be upgraded  to meet the European standards."    Although Vietnam's banks will not pose competition for Thai  banks, they will encourage our institutions to develop further,  stressed Dr Som Chatusiphithak president of Thai Bankers  Association.    Vietnam, a promising investment area due to its abundant  resources and low wage labour, recently launched several schemes  to develop its financial sector. Aside from bank development,  the country is planning a stock exchange for next year.    Vietnam alone may not be able to set up an exchange due to  high investment required for the entity. Formation of the  bourse, however, would help large companies raise cheap funds,  said Wichit.    Prior to the bourse's establishment, Vietnam should upgrade  its private and public organizations to meet listing  qualifications. The country is currently drafting stock exchange  regulations.    A developed banking industry will support exchange  procedures  through loans to companies. As a result, companies will improve  performance and qualify for listing.    The central banker earlier said Vietnamese firms will be  given listings on the Stock Exchange of Thailand if they meet  requirements of the Thai bourse and the Securities and Exchange  Commission. However, Wichit does not expect the Vietnamese  exchange will encourage fund shifts from Thailand to Vietnam.    Vietnam has applied for a seat in the Association of  Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Wichit dismissed the  possibility that Asean's economic growth will drop once the  country is admitted.    Once Vietnam is an Asean member, Thailand will have an edge  over other Asean members due to the cultural and geographical  proximity.</p>

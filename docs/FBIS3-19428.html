Finnish trade politicians and Finnish industry can now  look forward to resuming work within the mixed Finnish-Russian  economic commission. One of the first tasks of the new  commission will be to review the impact of possible Finnish EU  membership on bilateral trade relations between Finland and  Russia. Prime Minister Chernomyrdin assured journalists,  however, that Russia's attitude to Finnish membership of the EU  is frankly positive, but he stressed the importance of  safeguarding bilateral relations in trade and industry despite  possible Finnish membership.    Economic issues also dominated talks between Prime Ministers  Esko Aho and Chernomyrdin. Aho stated that he was pleased to  see that the mixed economic committee can resume its work. This  will make it possible to resolve several practical problems.  Aho and Chernomyrdin also discussed Finnish participation in  Russian industrial projects, especially in the raw-materials  sector. Natural gas and cooperation in this area was a subject  of great interest, according to Aho. The only incident at  Friday's [11 March] news conference arose when a journalist  asked whether Russia wishes to alter the border fixed by the  Paris treaty after World War II. Russia's Ambassador to Finland  Yuriy Deryabin had to stand up and explain to Chernomyrdin what  he had meant by his statements about the Paris treaty, whereupon  Chernomyrdin made the point that discussing cooperation in the  neighboring border areas is more important than changing borders.  <H5>  Weapons as Partial Payment </H5>   One of the agreements signed on Friday concerns supplies of  Russian arms in payment for a debt of about 500 million Markka,  which has been on a special Bank of Finland account since the  time of the bilateral clearing trade. The account was  established at a time when the trade imbalance was critical,  with the intention of allowing the Soviet Union to amortize it  by small installments. But the account is still there. Aho  thinks that weapons supplies are an excellent idea and that they  can also be discussed as a means of repaying other debts.    At his meeting with the representatives of Finnish industry,  Chernomyrdin stated that the worst crisis in trade was now over.  The volume of trade has begun to rise, but there are still  Finnish claims worth 6 billion Markka dating back to the  bilateral clearing trade. Of that amount the industry has  nearly 0.5 billion Markka worth of claims without any collateral.    Russian foreign debts are great, Chernomyrdin said, but he  pointed out that, although 6 billion Markka is a large amount,  it is still only a fraction of the total Russian debt. This  issue has therefore not been given priority treatment.    "We have begun to pay back our debt through weapons supplies  as a means of reimbursing the debt on the special account. This  is a first step and Finland will get its money back, although  negotiations for any remaining outstanding credits will be take  place through other channels." Finland will negotiate  state-guaranteed credits together with other Western countries  at the so-called Paris Club, whereas Western banks will  negotiate their claims jointly via the London Club.  <H5>  The New and Old Mixed Commission </H5>   Participating in the meeting with representatives of  industry  was Russian Foreign Trade Minister Oleg Davidov, who has been  appointed chairman of the Russian half of the mixed economic  commission. The nature of the commission has changed since the  Soviet period, but it is still regarded as an important  discussion forum. It has, however, not been able to work  effectively while being without a Russian chairman for a longer  period. Prime Minister Aho hopes that the commission will now  be able to resolve some open trade questions. Chernomyrdin  assured journalists that economic reform in Russia will continue  and that Russia is planning to modify and facilitate its foreign  trade while safeguarding Russian interests in both import and  export. The problems are still great, but the direction is  right, the prime minister stated. He added that there are plans  for several industrial projects in which a need for  Finnish-Russian cooperation may arise.  <H5>  Many Plans </H5>   Representatives of Finnish enterprises presented their own  plans on cooperation during a meeting with Chernomyrdin lasting  over an hour. Metra discussed its diesel engine plant in St.  Petersburg, which is nearing completion and which the company  wants to see operational as soon as possible. Rautaruukki  touched on the prospects of delivering the remainder of  Trabstech's special wagons to Russia, and Outokumpu put forward  its views on metallurgical cooperation on the Kola peninsula.  Valmet has new plans for cooperation in the vehicle component  sector in St. Petersburg.  <H5>  Several Agreements </H5>   During the first day of his visit, the Russian prime  minister  met with President Ahtisaari, whom he briefed on Russia's  economic and political situation. Friday also saw the signing  of four bilateral agreements. One of them is to allow frontier  crossing at other than official crossing points for purposes of  trade and transport. Then there is an agreement on cooperation  between the two countries' customs administrations to prevent  customs violations. Two other agreements concern fish and  cooperation in post and telecommunication services.    Today Chernomyrdin is to visit Neste, the state-owned energy  company, to witness the signing of several natural gas  agreements, including one on increased deliveries of natural gas  to Finland.</p>

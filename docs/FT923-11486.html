			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Italian companies face credit rating scrutiny THE CREDIT standing of Italy's two biggest state holding companies was yesterday put under review for a possible downgrade by Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the two leading international rating agencies. The scrutiny of ENI and IRI marks the latest sign of concern in the international financial community over the break-up of Efim, another Italian state holding company. Italian authorities have said that Efim and its subsidiaries will not service their debts for up to two years while the group's assets are sold off. 'That happening to one of the leading holding companies has to make you ask about the others,' said an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's. Both credit rating agencies said their review was prompted by the Italian government's moves to restructure the state's industrial holdings, as well as the deferral of interest payments by Efim. IRI and ENI have the highest credit ratings from the two agencies for their short-term debt, neither have long-term debt ratings. The ratings are in the names of their fund-raising arms, Cofiri International and ENI International Bank. Standard &amp; Poor's said it may downgrade its ratings of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro and Banco di Napoli, and it has switched the outlook of Banco Commerciale Italiana, from stable to negative. Moody's said in early June that it may downgrade Italy's state debt. Standard &amp; Poor's yesterday reaffirmed its ratings for the republic. IRI, the main state holding company, and ENI, the oil concern, have both been converted into joint stock companies in preparation for possible privatisation.</p>

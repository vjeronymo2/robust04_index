			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen rebounds against dollar THE YEN performed strongly against the dollar in Friday's Asian and European trading despite the dramatic intervention by the US Federal Reserve in support of its currency the previous day, writes James Blitz. The US authorities' intervention pushed the dollar to a high of Y106.70 at about 8 o'clock on Thursday evening in London. But the yen drifted up again afterwards, and, when Tokyo opened on Friday morning, profit taking had pushed the Japanese currency to a Tokyo close of around Y104.30. The yen also gained from comments made by Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the Japanese trade minister, who said there was no bilateral agreement between his country and the US to counter the fall in the dollar/yen exchange rate. European traders tried and failed to push the currency below the 104 level yesterday. But there was no further intervention from the US authorities when New York opened, and, at the close in London, the yen was at Y104.85 from a previous Y104.15. The lack of intervention could not be read as any change of view in the US on the yen. Thursday had seen a classic demonstration of short-term currency intervention, but the US authorities would have lacked the element of surprise yesterday. Mr David Cocker, chief economist at Chemical Bank, said that Monday's Tokyo trading would decide where, and how fast, the yen goes next. 'Japanese exporters will mull over events at the weekend,' he said. 'They will be under pressure to sell dollars now in the belief that they may get fewer yen for them if they wait.' In Europe, the main focus was on comments by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank's President-elect, who said that a strong D-Mark could hamper Germany's exporters. Dealers have long been of the view that Mr Tietmeyer would take a softer approach to the need for a strong D-Mark than the current president, Mr Helmut Schlesinger. The comments led to a softening of the German currency across the board, although dealers may be mistaken if they think that the cut in German interest rates will come quickly. The French franc closed at FFr3.478 against the D-Mark from a previous FFr3.495. The Danish krone was little changed on the day closing at around DKr4.0760 against the German currency. Sterling was caught in tight ranges, little affected by trade figures which showed that Britain's visible trade gap with non-European Community countries widened in July. The pound ended down  1/4 pfennig at DM2.5375. The dollar closed at DM1.6800 from a previous DM1.6865.</p>

			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH TO END CAPITAL GAINS FIGHT IF U.S. DEFAULT LOOMS  </P> <P> The Bush Administration will abandon its proposed capital-gains tax cut if  faced with the threat of the government's defaulting on its loans, a Treasury  Department official said today.  </P> <P> "If it were literally a choice between capital gains and default, obviously  Treasury would not allow default," Undersecretary Robert R. Glauber told a  House Ways and Means subcommittee.  </P> <P> Glauber responded only after considerable prodding by Democratic members of the  oversight subcommittee. They fear that efforts by Senate Republicans to add a  capital-gains cut to a bill extending the government's borrowing authority  could jeopardize that bill and push the government toward default next week.  </P> <P> Meantime, President Bush told a news conference, "I plan to fight for my  position" favoring a capital-gains tax cut. "It's something that's good for  growth . . . investment . . . jobs," he said.  </P> <P> Capital gains are profits from the sales of investments such as real estate and  securities. They are now taxed at the same rate as other income. A House-passed  bill, which Bush endorses, would create a lower rate for capital gains for 2  1/4 years and then permanently adjust the tax system so that gains caused  solely by inflation were not taxed.  </P> <P> Capital gains has become the dominant issue before Congress. Bush's push for  the tax cut against opposition of Democratic leaders has blocked action on a  $16-billion deficit-reduction bill, on legislation to boost aid to Poland and  Hungary and on the measure raising the government's debt ceiling.  </P></p>

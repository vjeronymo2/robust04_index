Durban police spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo said eyewitnesses  saw a red bakkie carrying armed men into the township, about  15km north of Empangeni, at about 4am.    "They opened fire at two different bus stops, killing six  people and injuring seven. The victims were shot at random."    The attackers were armed with AK-47 rifles, 9mm pistols and  shotguns, said Maj Naidoo. The attack comes amid heightened  political tension in the volatile northern Natal region and  ahead of a visit to the University of Zululand by African  National Congress President Nelson Mandela, who will address  supporters there on Saturday.</p>

			<p>920803 FT  03 AUG 92 / Farmers attack EC wheat move: Millions in subsidies at risk BRITISH farmers have strongly criticised a European Community decision that will deprive them of wheat subsidies worth millions of pounds. EC officials working on reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) decided during the weekend that from November 1993 only wheat used to make bread will be eligible for subsidies. Wheat used for animal feed, which represents about 80 per cent of the UK crop (some 13.5m tonnes), will no longer be eligible. In the past, both categories of wheat would be bought and stored by the EC if the market price fell below a certain level. 'It was an irrational decision,' the National Farmers' Union (NFU) said. The union believes that the impact on British farmers will depend on the market price of wheat, 'but it means the safety net is not there, as we would have liked'. Last year about 20m tonnes of grain fell into the net, of which a significant proportion was British wheat. The NFU said it was also angered by the UK government's failure to back its farmers by seeking a more relaxed rule on the moisture content of British wheat, as other member states have done. UK wheat must contain only 14.5 per cent moisture, while other EC countries have won the case for a 15 per cent limit. 'The two things together make a nonsense of the idea of a level playing field,' the NFU said. The Ministry of Agriculture said yesterday that British feed wheat would still be bought by the EC if its price fell 5 per cent below the price of bread wheat. It said: 'There is still a safety net. We haven't needed to rely on intervention in this country before now because the price of wheat hasn't been that weak.' The NFU said it would continue to press for changes to the new regime. Although the government had negotiated a good deal for UK farmers overall, it said, it could have won more concessions when it came to the detail of CAP reforms.</p>

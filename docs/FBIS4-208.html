			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unsigned editorial] </F>   [Text] As the tragic Angolan situation has taught us, the  formation of a truly national army before the elections is a  basic condition for the peace process to anchor at the port of  democracy with no problems.    In Luanda, this aspect was taken lightly by the United  Nations, which, a few days before elections were held, hurriedly  "decreed" the existence of a single armed forces and the  disbanding of troops of the warring factions. This was  something that only existed on paper because in practice, as  everybody knew, both the MPLA [Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola] and UNITA [National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola] kept the "crack units" of their  respective military forces in place, as a precaution for what  could come afterward.    What did "come" afterward was an armed conflict of  consequences even more serious than the previous ones, with  FAPLA [People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola] and  FALA [Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola] emerging on the  ground better equipped than ever before.    It was a new and bloody civil war that shattered, as if it  were a soap bubble, the fragile and theoretical "intention" of a  single national army that Unavem [UN Angola Verification  Mission] decided to bring about at full steam.    Thus, before one debates the reasons that one or the other  of  the contenders on the Atlantic coast gave to resume the mutual  slaughter, we will have to attribute to the UN's criminal  precipitation and hasty "washing of hands" the main  responsibility for the bloodbath that continues in a country  once again deprived of a future of progress and peace.    Meanwhile, in Mozambique, the United States, the Unomoz [UN  Operations in Mozambique], and the government are together  traveling down a "path of disaster," similar in all aspects to  the one traveled in Angola. Taking advantage of its status as  the only superpower, Washington insists that elections ought to  be held in October, alleging lack of "patience" and resources to  finance the process, while shrugging its shoulders about the  possibility of pushing Mozambicans to a pre-electoral abyss.  The United Nations is servilely attuned to that rationale,  closing its eyes both to the facts and the government's sabotage  of the process, while keeping itself busy arranging and  rearranging timetables -- in fact manipulating the lives of  millions of Mozambicans as if they were mere pawns in a chess  game.    The government is sticking to the "scheduled delay" in  confining its forces, hindering the emergence of the FADM  [Mozambique Defense Armed Forces], and giving strong indications  that it is forming a "stand-by army" that would be on hand in  case of an electoral defeat. This very serious violation of the  AGP [General Peace Accord] and this true blow to the prospects  of future peace and democracy is still being taken lightly by  Unomoz, which, right now, might have visualized an FADM suitable  for passing out parades on public holidays as sufficiently good  for backward Mozambicans for the sake of the sacrosanct  adherence to timetables.    The rest can be neglected -- the prospects of the loss of a  few more thousands of lives and the continued existence of  various armies in tandem with a national army that is still on  the drawing board. What matters is to adhere to the dogma  originating from the "U.S. boss," as inspired on its "promising"  Somalia adventure. which was like a bull in a china shop.    Aware of Frelimo's [Mozambique Liberation Front] methods and  "tricks," we know too well the government's hidden intentions in  delaying the confinement of its troops: to secure the practical  neutralization of Renamo Defense Force's soldiers while keeping  in place its army's "elite" units. Afterward, it would be just  a matter of using any violation of the AGP as a pretext to  annihilate what is left of Renamo, and then return to the good  old days of a single party to which half a dozen of smaller  tamed political groupings would lend a "democratic" and  "pluralist" facade.    This frightening return to the past is, however, something  which we will oppose with all the means at our disposal,  regardless of where the pressure may come from.</p>

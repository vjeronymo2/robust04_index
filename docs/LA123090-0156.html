			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEPOSITION: KIMBLE GOT MONEY, TOO;  </P> <P> LOYOLA: ATTORNEY FOR GATHERS FAMILY SAYS PLAYER ALSO RECEIVED FUNDS FROM ALBERT  GERSTEN.  </P> <P> Bruce Fagel, the attorney for the family of Hank Gathers, said Saturday that  Loyola Marymount University officials not only knew Gathers was receiving  improper cash payments when he was on a basketball scholarship to the school,  but they encouraged the "deal" by ignoring it. Speaking from Hawaii, where he  is vacationing, Fagel also implicated Bo Kimble, saying that Gathers' mother,  Lucille, saw Kimble receive money from Albert Gersten, the booster she says  also gave money to her son.  </P> <P> "In Lucille Gathers' testimony, in her deposition, she says she saw Albert  Gersten going around a dinner table after a game, peeling off money and giving  it to the players," Fagel said, adding that Lucille told him the incident  occurred after an NCAA tournament game in 1989.  </P> <P> "She said she saw Gersten give money to Hank and to Bo, but then the attorneys  started going down the list of players, asking Mrs. Gathers who else received  the money, and she wouldn't identify any others."  </P> <P> Fagel said Lucille Gathers' testimony was taken in connection with a wrongful  death suit filed by Gathers' family against Loyola and 13 other defendants.  </P> <P> Kimble, reached at the Los Angeles Airport, said he would not comment on the  allegation. "I have been advised by my attorney not to give a comment because  of pending litigation," Kimble said upon returning from the Clippers' game  Saturday in Salt Lake City.  </P> <P> Fagel was reacting to a Times story, reported Thursday, which quoted from  depositions. His statement Saturday came from additional information from other  depositions.  </P> <P> The Times reported Thursday that Lucille Gathers testified under oath that she  received $2,000 in cash from her son, plus gifts, while he was attending  Loyola. She said Gathers bought the gifts with money he received from Gersten,  a Loyola Marymount alumnus and Beverly Hills real estate developer. Gersten is  the main contributor to the university gymnasium, named for his father.  </P> <P> He has previously denied allegations that he gave Gathers money. Gersten could  not be reached Saturday.  </P> <P> Such gifts to a player are violations of NCAA rules, and if the accusations  found are true, Loyola will face penalties by the NCAA and the West Coast  Conference, Loyola's league.  </P> <P> Gathers collapsed March 4 at Gersten Pavilion while playing in a conference  tournament game and was pronounced dead 1 hour 40 minutes later. An autopsy  determined the cause of death to be cardiomyopathy, a heart disorder.  </P> <P> Gathers' mother, brothers Derrick and Charles, and an aunt, Carol Livingston,  filed a $32.5-million suit claiming negligence, conspiracy and wrongful death.  The suit has been consolidated with another filed by Gathers' 6-year-old son,  Aaron Crump.  </P> <P> Fagel seeks to prove that Lucille Gathers was being supported by her son to sue  for wrongful death, the strongest cause of his suit. A motion to decide the  issue will be heard in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Jan. 17.  </P> <P> Saturday, Fagel issued a statement on behalf of the family in response to The  Times report, saying:  </P> <P> ". . . The family does not accuse Albert Gersten of doing anything except being  Hank's friend and helping the Gathers family survive financially before Hank's  death.  </P> <P> "After Hank's death, both Gersten and his wife were there to provide moral  support for the family. . . .  </P> <P> "Al Gersten did nothing wrong then or now. The real villains in this story are  not Lucille or Hank for accepting money or Al Gersten for giving it, but rather  Loyola for encouraging a deal involving Hank Gathers, then reaping all the  benefits of that deal. And now they are trying to deny the existence of a deal  which flies in the face of all the facts which are known about Hank Gathers  life."  </P> <P> Fagel said the "deal" was a way to keep Gathers in school instead of turning  professional after his junior season, in which he led the nation in scoring and  rebounding.  </P> <P> "There was no written contract, but Hank knew that his mother's disability  payments (for hepatitis) were about to run out, and that his statistics in his  junior year would put him in the top 10 in the NBA draft," Fagel said. "His mom  wanted him to stay in school to get his degree, but Hank also wanted to take  care of himself and his family.  </P> <P> "So then Gathers decides to stay in school, and the next thing he moves into a  $1,100 a month apartment of which he pays the entire rent. He gets a brand new  car and has enough cash to do his thing, and if that meant going to the (horse)  track then he could, and he has enough money to take care of his mother. And  there are several components to this deal that clearly had to involve people  beyond Gersten and (then head coach Paul) Westhead."  </P> <P> Fagel said that Westhead, in his deposition, denied knowing anything about  Gathers receiving money from Gersten. "But I think that is the reason Westhead  left the school, because he knew what was coming down and he didn't want to  bear the brunt of an NCAA investigation," Fagel said.  </P> <P> Westhead left Loyola to become coach of the Denver Nuggets of the NBA. "I knew  nothing of what he was talking about (the alleged payments)," Westhead said  Saturday from Washington, where the Nuggets played the Bullets. "His  assumptions (that an NCAA investigation played a part in his leaving Loyola for  the Nuggets) are erroneous. Beyond that, I have no comment."  </P> <P> In his senior year, Gathers drove a new Mercury Cougar leased from Southwest  Leasing and Rental Company in Los Angeles. It was returned to that company in  July by Derrick Gathers, Gathers brother.  </P> <P> "The car was co-signed by a business associate of Al Gersten, who had no  affiliation with Loyola, but had no reason to co-sign other than that he was  close to Gersten," Fagel said.  </P> <P> Brian Quinn, Loyola's athletic director, has repeatedly denied the allegations  and said he was satisfied with Gathers' explanation that he obtained his new  car by getting a loan from a friend in Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Quinn said Saturday: "Hank wanted to live off campus and he received the  stipend for room and board (around $600), and that is normal. A lot of our  athletes want to live off campus. It sounds to me that Mr. Fagel wants to try  the case in the newspaper instead of the court system. Let this go and be  decided through the proper legal system."  </P> <P> For Loyola's basketball program, that legal system is the NCAA, which has not  commented specifically on the case. Fagel and Lucille Gathers say that Derrick  Gathers also received money directly from Gersten.  </P> <P> "In Derrick's deposition testimony, he says that he used to go to Gersten's  house with Hank to pick up money," Fagel said. "At first, Derrick said Hank  would go upstairs and return with the money, and they would leave. Then Gersten  became comfortable with Derrick and would hand Hank the money in front of him.  After a while, Derrick said Gersten would give him cash, too."  </P> <P> It is not clear if Cal State Northridge, which Derrick attended on a basketball  scholarship, could be penalized by the NCAA if Gersten gave money to him  directly or indirectly. Northridge is filing a report to the NCAA.  </P> <P> What is clear is that penalties Loyola might face have nothing to do with the  suit the Gathers' family is pursuing.  </P> <P> ". . . The family does not consider NCAA rules to be appropriate under these  conditions," Fagel said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Jim Hodges contributed to this story.  </P></p>

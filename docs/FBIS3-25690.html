			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mohamed Abdullatif, adviser to General </F> Mohamed Farah Aidid, by Perry Kretz; place and date not given:  "`Our People Are Tired of War'"]    [Text] [Kretz] What do you think about the German troop  withdrawal?    [Abdullatif] We want all troops, irrespective of their  nationality, to leave our country. This military intervention  under the smokescreen of the UN operation has brought even more  instability to our country after years of civil war. Everyone  involved carries the same responsibility, including the Germans.    [Kretz] Will a new civil war erupt?    [Abdullatif] Our people are tired of war. We want to bring  about stability and achieve peace without foreign assistance.    [Kretz] How should that happen?    [Abdullatif] We will work to disarm ourselves and create a  new administration. Then, other countries could also help us.  Disarmament should not involve violence. There should also be  no more military conflicts between the two big clans, General  Aidid's Habargidir and clan leader Ali Mahdi's Abgal.    [Kretz] Would Aidid be prepared to assume the post of  president?    [Abdullatif] If he is called upon do so, he will. In the  end, he is a prominent person, and it was he who chased the  former dictator Barre out of the country. However, we will not  resort to weapons and democratic elections will be held.    [Kretz] Don't you need foreign assistance to rebuild the  country?    [Abdullatif] We have established contacts with other African  countries that will assist us in reconstruction. We would like  Germany to be the first European country that we will visit. We  told that to the German ambassador in Nairobi, and we would  welcome German assistance. The Germans are always welcome in  Somalia. The condition is that they do not come in uniforms.</p>

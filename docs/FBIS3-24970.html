			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review section of the "Focus on Africa" </F> program]    [Text] We start the day with a story that has been on the  front pages of several Nigerian papers. Here is the headline of  GUARDIAN: Obasanjo and Buhari List Leadership Ills. Yes, both  former military rulers--one who gave power up to a democratic  government and one who took power back again--have condemned the  new regime of Sani Abacha.    The GUARDIAN reports thus: General Buhari suggested the  removal of all those responsible for the economic and political  malaise from leadership positions, and Gen. Obasanjo advocated a  nonmilitary national government to tackle Nigeria's political,  economic, and social ills. But there isn't just the military  who get the blame. Gen. Obasanjo accused Nigerians of being  accomplices by their silence, saying that if only six  responsible, principled, and respected persons nationwide had  rallied, then this harrowing experience might have been avoided.  Presumably, [words indistinct] when you take the two former  leaders into account. Anyway, Gen. Buhari agreed. He said: It  is time for the return of reason. Decent people should no  longer leave matters in the hands of irresponsible elements.</p>

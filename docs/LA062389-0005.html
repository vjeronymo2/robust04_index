			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALANCING ACT  </P> <P> Pondering its response to the repression and brutality inflicted by the Chinese  government on its own people this month, the Bush Administration found itself  confronting a sad and familiar dilemma. American moral values and political  principles demanded that official outrage should be not just expressed but  tangibly acted upon. The question, as always, was how to do that without, in  the process, doing harm to the Chinese people, with whom this country has no  quarrel, and without jeopardizing the future of a delicate and important  country-to-country relationship. In the end the Administration was no better  able to find a satisfactory answer than any of its predecessors were in similar  situations.  </P> <P> What it has done is take the minimum responsive steps that circumstances  required. It postponed further high-level bilateral government and military  meetings. It suspended sales of certain military and other equipment. It said  it would try to get international financial institutions to defer acting on  pending loan applications from China. And that was pretty much that. Postpone,  suspend, defer: There is nothing irrevocable about any of these actions, and,  as a practical matter, nothing very effective, either. No bridges were burned  by the careful U.S. response, but neither did it stay the heavy hand of  repression in China.  </P> <P> To say this isn't to suggest that the Administration necessarily could have  done better. Some in Congress have been quick to denounce a perceived timidity  and even cravenness on the Administration's part, but their criticisms have  stopped well short of proposing feasible alternative actions. What, in fact,  could have been done? To have brought to bear the full arsenal of commercial,  trade and diplomatic sanctions would surely have hurt China's economy, but the  heaviest pain would have been felt by its people. At the same time, efforts to  impose major sanctions would only have been seized upon by those Chinese  leaders who oppose closer ties with the outside world as a vindication of their  autarkic and isolationist views.  </P> <P> What kind of China does the United States want to see? Clearly it's in  long-term American interests to have a China that is politically stable,  steadily prospering, more closely integrated in the world community and  governed by moderate and humane leaders. It is this sense of what the future  could bring that above all has guided the measured U.S. response to recent  events. The additional hope, of course, is that there will be room in such a  China for far more individual freedom and far more respect for human rights.  It's proper -- indeed, imperative -- for the United States and other democratic  countries to continue expressing that hope. It's no less imperative that the  democracies go on condemning in the clearest and strongest words all efforts by  the present Chinese regime to crush that hope.  </P></p>

"This is a justifiable claim  giving expression to the aspirations of his people," said  Conservative Party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg.    Signing himself as transitional Volksraad [National  Assembly]  president, Dr Hartzenberg said in a statement on Tuesday the  interim constitution did not accommodate such expression and  therefore offered no lasting political solutions for South  Africa. "The Afrikaner nation's demand for freedom and  self-determination in its own republic with its own constitution  is also a justifiable claim which needs to be addressed," Dr  Hartzenberg said.    These demands would have to be accommodated in a future  constitutional dispensation for peace and prosperity.</p>

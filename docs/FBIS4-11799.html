			<p>BFN     [Text] A support rally for the Jewish settlers in Hebron  and Qiryat Arba' ended in Qiryat Arba' a short time ago. Our  correspondent Gil Litman reports that many thousands of people  participated in the rally, among them the heads of the Knesset  opposition factions and Knesset members [MK's]. The organizers  distributed registration cards urging participants to defend  Hebron if a decision is taken to evacuate Jews from the city.  Border policemen prevented several young Kakh supporters from  hoisting Kakh flags during the rally.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 1600 GMT 31 March,  reporting on the Qiryat Arba' rally, adds the following: "MK  Ari'el Sharon, who addressed the massive rally, said that as far  as he is concerned, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres is no longer  the foreign minister of the Jewish state, but rather the foreign  minister of the state of Palestine. According to Sharon the  Israeli Government is not a Jewish and Zionist government, and  as far as he is concerned, Shim'on Peres -- who is returning the  Gaza Strip and Jericho to 'Arafat -- can stay there with the  head of the PLO." "MK Binyamin Netanyahu called on the audience  to oppose the evacuation of Jews from Hebron by all legal means  possible. MK Refa'el Eytan demanded that the government hold  elections prior to such a move."]</p>

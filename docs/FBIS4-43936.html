			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 22 (AFP) -- French rail workers  protesting job cuts went on strike on Wednesday [22 June],  seriously disrupting train services across most of the country.    High-speed trains serving the south and west of the country  were hit, with one train in three running between Paris, Lyon  and Marseille, and one train in two working Atlantic routes.    But the high-speed service linking Paris with Lille in the  north was not affected.    Regular mainline services were also severely hit in the  western, south-western and south-eastern regions, but operated  normally in the north and east. Suburban Paris services were cut  by a third or a half.    Railway workers are protesting plans by the state-owned SNCF  rail company to cut 5,900 jobs in 1994, after doing away with  6,000 jobs in the previous year. The strikers, who began their  action Tuesday night, go back to work on Thursday morning.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / World Trade News: SNCF to buy 100 diesel units SNCF, the French state-owned railway system, is to buy 100 diesel locomotives, in a deal worth FFr2.5bn (Dollars 470m), from GEC-Alsthom Anglo-French engineering group. Under the terms of the deal announced yesterday, which could rise to 250 diesel units, France's regional councils are to assure the financing of the building of the locomotives. The state is to give a subsidy of FFr80m for the first 100 units. SNCF will finance part of the research and launch costs for an amount of FFr211m. The order will come as a relief to GEC-Alsthom, which is jointly owned by Alcatel Alsthom of France and GEC of the UK. SNCF has long delayed the order for new diesel locomotives, contributing to a decision to restructure and cut jobs at the joint venture's transport division earlier this year. The diesel units, which will each comprise one motor wagon and one trailer, are likely to be built at GEC-Alsthom's plant in La Rochelle in western France. The first locomotive is due to be delivered in 1997, with the rest of the order staggered until 2000. While the contract is a significant order, it is not the largest of its kind to be received by GEC-Alsthom. Orders for the high-speed trains a grande vitesse have sometimes represented more than twice as much.</p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Monks says tide has turned decisively for unions The tide 'turned decisively towards trade unionism' in 1994 and 1995 will be 'crucial' for its continuing renewal, Mr John Monks, Trades Union Congress general secretary, says today in his new year message. He says that unions must adopt four priorities for action in 1995: To win the argument for a new legal system of representation and recognition for all British workers. To press home the case for minimum wage legislation to protect the low-paid. To develop partnership relations with employers on a wider basis. To make the case that competitiveness and performance at work depend crucially on good training, career development and job security rather than deregulation and insecurity. Mr Monks also points to a wide range of issues on which he says unions have made a comeback during the past year. These include 'significant victories' to prevent Post Office privatisation and government-imposed cuts in the level of criminal injuries compensation. Mr Monks also points to the breakthrough in the European social agenda, in spite of the government's opt-out from the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty. He also draws comfort from a report by the Tory-dominated Commons employment committee which recognised that unions had a positive role to play. 'Its language was light years away from the rhetoric of the 'enemy within' and crude hostility to unions of the 1980s,' he said. Mr Monks added that the standing of unions had never been higher than it was now among the public, while job insecurity and concern over top executive pay rises had heightened the attraction of belonging to a trade union. In his new year message Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, said union negotiators should seek a guarantee that workers should share in the success of the companies they worked for with pay rises that matched those being taken by chief executives. He said: 'We have to break this cycle of only rewarding the bosses and shareholders for increased productivity and profitability. Workers should share success as well.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Eastern Europe -- Parliament </F> Approves EU Contribution to EBRD's "Nuclear Safety" Account"; as  released by Brussels Textline database]    [Text] Reinforcing nuclear safety in the countries of  Eastern Europe is a matter of great importance to the European  Parliament, which has followed its rapporteur Mr. Adam (Soc, UK)  and approved the Council's proposal of contributing 20 million  Ecus to the "nuclear safety" account set up with the European  Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). In his report,  Mr. Adam states that the first operations done in this area by  the EBRD in Bulgaria and Lithuania seem to meet EP criteria.  The next operations in Russia are a test of the EBRD's strategy  and are therefore to be closely monitored by the Community  institutions. The sums in question were included in the 1993  budget but were not committed because there was no legal base.  They are included in the 1994 budget as a token entry, and if  the 1993 appropriations are to be used this year, a decision  will have to be made before the end of March.    The EP wants the operations in question to be included in a  strategic and safety action plan negotiated with the beneficiary  countries (which should respect the main international  agreements of security) and the interested countries to be  endowed with an independent body responsible for safety. It  also called for the early closure of the plants the least safe.  During the debate, Mr. Bettini (Greens, It) criticized the  report, calling for large-scale reconversion to "clean" energy,  as Mr. Shevardnadze himself had proposed for all of Georgia's  energy.</p>

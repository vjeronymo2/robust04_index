			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / International Company News: Thyssen units to merge operations THE management boards of Thyssen, Germany's biggest steelmaker, and its steel-making subsidiaries Thyssen Stahl and Thyssen Edelstahlwerke, yesterday gave their blessing to a merger of the activities of the two operations. A brief announcement said the move was unanimously approved as 'the appropriate answer to the current profit situation and to the likely market development'. The move follows several years of losses at Thyssen Edelstahl, the special steels manufacturer, and inconclusive negotiations with Krupp, the rival steelmaker, over a proposal for co-operation in special steel manufacture. Results are to be produced at both subsidiaries later this month. Thyssen Edelstahl lost DM176m (Dollars 110m) on turnover of DM3.9bn in 1990, while Thyssen Stahl saw a 16 per cent drop in profits on turnover of DM10.5bn. Both have been hit by low world prices and demand, and most recently by the slowdown in the German metalworking and engineering industries. The company statement said the merger plans would now be discussed with the group's employees, before coming for a final decision to the supervisory boards of the companies in June.</p>

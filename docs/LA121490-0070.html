			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LINDSAY'S STEPSON APPOINTED GUARDIAN OF COUNCILMAN'S ESTATE  </P> <P> The stepson of ailing Los Angeles City Councilman Gilbert Lindsay was appointed  temporary conservator of his estate Thursday, an action that sets the stage for  a lawsuit to reclaim the elderly councilman's property from his former  girlfriend.  </P> <P> During a brief proceeding in Superior Court, a new allegation emerged that the  woman, Juanda Chauncie, 39, obtained $65,000 from Lindsay's bank account at  Broadway Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn.  </P> <P> Lindsay, 90, has been hospitalized since he suffered a stroke Sept. 2 and  remains partially paralyzed and unable to speak.  </P> <P> In court papers filed Thursday, Herbert Howard, the stepson, said that  Lindsay's condition is deteriorating and he has no one to provide for him or  give consent for his medical care.  </P> <P> "We fear that unless he has a conservator appointed immediately, it will result  in a loss" to Lindsay and his estate, the papers said.  </P> <P> Contacted by telephone at her home Thursday evening, Chauncie hung up on a  reporter.  </P> <P> The Times reported last month that over the last two years, Chauncie has  obtained a financial interest in much of Lindsay's real estate and is  attempting to evict an elderly couple from a house Lindsay had rented to them  for 20 years.  </P> <P> Attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., who drew up Lindsay's will and now represents  his stepson, said he intends to file a lawsuit within the next few days to  reclaim that house and other property.  </P> <P> Because Chauncie is attempting to sell the house Lindsay rented to the couple,  "it is important that a lawsuit be filed immediately . . . to stop the sale,"  Cochran said.  </P> <P> The temporary conservatorship, which was approved by Superior Court  Commissioner Ann Stodden, gives Howard authority over Lindsay's estate so that  he can file the lawsuit, Cochran said. Neither Chauncie nor her attorney  attended the court proceeding, Cochran said. A full hearing on the matter was  set for Jan. 14.  </P> <P> Cochran said he is now investigating the circumstances under which Chauncie  obtained not only the property, but also the $65,000. He said he did not know  how Chauncie had gained access to the money. Cochran added that he is still  calculating the total value of Lindsay's estate.  </P> <P> Until 18 months ago, Lindsay owned three houses on East 52nd Place and at least  two commercial lots in Los Angeles. But now, records show, the only piece of  property he owns by himself is his modest home in South-Central Los Angeles.  </P></p>

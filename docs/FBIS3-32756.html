Lage Davila arrived in Santa Fe de Bogota on Wednesday when  he held his first meeting with President Cesar Gaviria, Foreign  Minister Nohemi Sanin, and other senior officials of Colombia's  economic sector.    Today he referred to the statement by a lieutenant of Pablo  Escobar who pointed to Castro as an alleged participant in the  drug trafficking of the Medellin cocaine cartel's gunned-down  capo. Lage said that the discovery of Escobar's secret  documents and tapes, which were confiscated by the authorities  following his death in Medellin on 2 December and in which Raul  Castro is accused of being an accomplice of drug trafficking,  "is an offense to Cuba." Escobar's secret documents were  revealed on Monday by the QAP television newscast. QAP aired a  cassette in which Escobar's lieutenant, known as David, accused  the Cuban president's brother of being an accomplice by having  cooperated in covering up drug-trafficking operations.    Lage Davila reiterated today that Raul Castro "enjoys great  prestige and affection from the Cuban people" and he indicated  that such accusations might be the work of "manipulation by the  enemies of the revolution" who have tried to implicate the  island in the scourge of drug trafficking. He emphasized that  "the Cuban revolution has maintained unyielding ethical and  moral values throughout its history. Neither drug trafficking  nor corruption, that is why we do not have the least concern  with that," he stressed.    During his visit to Santa Fe de Bogota, the Cuban Council of  State vice president also held meetings with Agriculture  Minister Jose Ocampo and directors of the National Planning  Department. Today, he will hold meetings with Foreign Trade  Minister Juan Manuel Santos, Health Minister Juan Luis Londono,  and Economic Development Minister Mauricio Cardenas. At the  Colombian Foreign Ministry, he will analyze the documents on the  composition of the joint Colombian-Cuban commission, the  creation of which will be signed in Havana between 16 and 18  February.    Lage Davila, who returns to Cuba tonight, explained that  with  the opening to foreign capital, there are no restrictions on  investment, especially in areas in which infrastructure already  exists and good results can be obtained in the short term. He  stressed that in Colombia's specific case, tourism and the  pharmaceutical industry open doors to new sectors susceptible to  awakening interest among Colombian-Cuban businessmen. Regarding  Cuba's foreign debt to Colombia, he said it will be canceled  gradually with Cuban pharmaceutical exports.    He said Cuba is looking toward the Caribbean and Latin  America, where it is seeking to diversify the offer of Cuban  products. He also said his country is ready for more difficult  moments as a result of the U.S. blockade.    Cuba and Colombia renewed diplomatic relations in October  after a more than 12-year suspension. The Colombian Government  of then President Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala had broken relations  after it was reported that the Cuban Government was lending  training and support to the Colombian guerrillas.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bavarian Minister-President Edmund Stoiber </F> by Gerhard Plott; place and date not given: "Bavarian Criticism  of Brussels Centralism"]    [Excerpts] [Plott] You have sharply criticized Bonn's  European policy and have described Chancellor Helmut Kohl as a  "European illusionist." What would your European policy look  like?    [Stoiber] Germany is basically pursuing a very good and  responsible European policy. It has to be made clear to people  that the European Union [EU] is a community for peace. Yet, in  the almost 40 years of the history of the EU there have also  been bureaucratic and misguided centralist developments, which  is what I criticized. Unfortunately, those who criticize  certain structures of the EU are deliberately misinterpreted --  as if one were an anti- European. Yet, no responsible  politician can be anti-European. I am calling for more  transparency, more subsidiarity....    [Plott] ...as was laid down in Maastricht.    [Stoiber] Yes, but it also has to be put into practice. The  problem is the deficit in democratic transparency of the Council  of Ministers, the complacency of the Commission, which is  absolutely detached from opinionmaking in the Parliament and  control by the Parliament; the strict regulations that even  determine whether or not people are permitted to swim in the  Isar River -- everything is being decided in Brussels. There  are many things that we do not need, things that increasingly  annoy the people, who then, based on this annoyance, question  Europe in general. That must be avoided. We must fight against  this annoyance, try to change things, and take people along with  Europe. Otherwise, we will drive them into the hands of the  anti-Europeans.    [Plott] How do you explain that Heiner Geissler, who is  deputy chairman of the Christian Democratic Union  [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] Bundestag Group, accused you  of high treason?    [Stoiber] I no longer take Geissler politically seriously.    [Plott] It has been said again and again that you are trying  to return to the nation state.    [Stoiber] That is wrong. I want to make clear that this  Europe is absolutely unable to progress without nation states  and without the nations' feeling of belonging together. A  nation state would constitute a piece of centralism and would  end national characteristic features, which would destroy Europe.    People are always insinuating that I want the nation state  as  such, based on the experience of the past. Yet I am thinking  further than that. Those who underestimate the cohesive  strength of the nation today and think that this strength could  be replaced by Europe will be in for a nasty surprise. Thus,  our Europe can only be one of nations and regions, a  confederation of states.    [Plott] Could one say that the Germans are becoming  unreliable fellows in European policy because they are seeking  the right to resign from the confederation?    [Stoiber] No, I have never asked for that. All I did was to  point out the difference between a federal state and a  confederation. One cannot resign from a federal state, whereas  from a confederation of states one can. Besides, the Federal  Constitutional Court put it in exactly the same way. [passage  omitted]    [Plott] Will Austria manage to enter the EU in time?    [Stoiber] I hope so, and I hope that the EU will show  greater understanding for Austria's cause. We have greatly  emphasized the need for Germany to support Austria's position in  the negotiations. For us, Austria's accession is of vital  importance.    The problems in the sphere of agriculture can be solved. The  most difficult issue will certainly be the transit agreement.  However, I think that a settlement can be found that is  acceptable for all sides.    [Plott] Would you recommend that the Austrians vote "yes" in  a referendum?    [Stoiber] Yes, by all means. Austria can progress for its  own good only when its ties with the neighboring countries  become closer and closer. [passage omitted]</p>

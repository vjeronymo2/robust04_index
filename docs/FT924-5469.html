			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: Government to delay setting share price THE French government is awaiting a rise in the depressed Paris stock market in the next few weeks before setting the price for the partial privatisation of Rhone-Poulenc, the state-owned chemicals and pharmaceuticals group. Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said that the government was showing confidence in the stock market's 'great capacity to appreciate' by giving the go-ahead for the sale of at least 6m Rhone-Poulenc shares, 10.6 per cent of the total. The international offer for sale will take place before February on a date to depend on stock market conditions, the finance ministry announced earlier, as carried in late editions of yesterday's FT. Of the total, 2.7m shares will be on offer in France, at least 1m will be offered in the US and 1.7m will be placed on other international markets. The remaining 600,000 shares, 10 per cent of the total being sold, will be reserved for group employees, at a 10 per cent discount to the offer price. French commercial banks Societe Generale and Banque Indosuez will manage the French share sale, while the US shares will be handled by Morgan Stanley. As a result of the sale and the enfranchisement of non-voting shareholders, the government's direct voting stake will drop from 77.5 per cent to around 45 per cent. However, the public sector will still have a majority, thanks to stakes held by Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank, and AGF, a state insurer. The government has reserved the right to sell more shares if required. The finance ministry confirmed that, following the sale, the government will offer to exchange Rhone-Poulenc preferred investment certificates and participating shares series A - two kinds of non-voting stock - into ordinary voting shares, at a rate of one for one.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nampula Governor Alfredo Gamito today accused the  Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] of still looking for  trouble by trying to expand the so-called areas under its  control, while launching frequent incursions into  government-administered areas where it detains people,  particularly members of the ruling Frelimo [Mozambique  Liberation Front] Party. Gamito said this while presenting a  provincial government report to President of the Republic  Joaquim Chissano.    Gamito said Afonso Dhlakama's men have been harassing those  they arrest. The governor said when faced with this situation,  the agencies established under the terms of the Rome peace  accord say the matter is the responsibility of the Mozambican  police because those actions are carried out by people wearing  civilian clothes, though it is known that they are Renamo  soldiers. Gamito noted that the police lack the means to  resolve such issues.    In his report, which was presented at an expanded meeting of  the Nampula provincial government, Gamito said Renamo's  relations with government agencies have been marked by  arrogance, clashes, and hostilities. He said but for the  provincial government's reconciliatory and reasonable posture,  the forces of law and order would have already opened police  files and initiated lawsuits.    Alfredo Gamito accused civil servants, workers, and vagrants  with a criminal record of also adopting an attitude marked by  arrogance, clashes and hostilities, and of being disrespectful.  Turning to the advisers appointed by Renamo, Gamito said they  also adopt the same attitude in dealing with him. The  provincial governor said he has serious doubts whether something  positive will be accomplished with the advisers or even if  Renamo intends to do something in areas it claims to control.  Gamito questioned whether Renamo's administration is not a mere  figment of its imagination. Governor Gamito said what one finds  in Nampula Province are military bases and the respective areas  of influence with captive residents, most of whom are not  originally from those areas.    Turning to his relations with other political parties,  Alfredo Gamito said they are constructive and characterized by  mutual respect, particularly with Maximo Dias' Mozambican  Nationalist Movement, and Carlos Reis' Mozambican National Union.    Gazmito added: That is the type of exhausting relationship  that we have been experiencing, but they will not be able to  wear us down.    The president of the republic is apparently pleased with the  political activities the Frelimo Party has been carrying out in  Nampula, judging by the thousands upon thousands of people who  welcomed him this morning. This afternoon, Chissano met with  the Frelimo Party's Provincial Committee.    A well known Nampula journalist said even if Frelimo loses  the legislative election in that province, Chissano will  definitely win the presidential election. One will be able to  gauge the electorate's mood during the rallies Chissano intends  to hold in the cities of Nampula and Nacala, as well as in the  capitals of Malema, Lalaua, and Namapa Districts. From what we  have so far seen in the city of Nampula, Chissano's adversaries  in the October presidential election will have to work very  hard. His opponents have not yet started campaigning, which  makes local analysts feel that a presidential candidate like  Arouca is naive and ignorant of the local situation when he  raises important issues in the press, but that does not say  anything to potential voters who do not have money to buy food,  let alone newspapers.    At this morning's meeting of the provincial government,  Gamito gave a detailed account of the socioeconomic situation in  the province.</p>

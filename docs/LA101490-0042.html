			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THROUGH TWO WINDOWS  </P> <P> Comforting, in its way, how, wherever you may be,  </P> <P> The effect's so much the same -- walking in Rome,  </P> <P> say, or Reykjavik, or one of those rust-red  </P> <P> Missouri rivertowns where we all were born and grew,  </P> <P> you merely glance right up into somebody's home,  </P> <P> catching the sky, out back, through two  </P> <P> sets of windows, and are in a sense home free:  </P> <P> free of everywhere you've lived, everything you've read.  </P> <P> It's a tinted sky -- as if by the lives bound like a book  </P> <P> between its panes -- and so not quite the one  </P> <P> you're standing under. No wonder, then, these odd un-  </P> <P> sorted feelings of exclusion and remorse . . .  </P> <P> all a small price to pay for any look  </P> <P> at the roof of another world, of course.  </P></p>

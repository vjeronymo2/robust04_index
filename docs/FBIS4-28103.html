			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- The House of Representatives  on Wednesday [8 June] approved a 73.08 trillion yen budget for  fiscal 1994, 70 days overdue and three months after it was  tabled in the Diet.    The passage of the bill at the lower house plenary session  followed approval of the fiscal budget for the year that started  in April by the Budget Committee of the lower house.    The ruling coalition, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and  new party Sakigake [Harbinger] voted for the bill, which was  immediately sent to the House of Councillors.    Since the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the largest  opposition bloc, plans no filibuster in the upper house, the  budget is expected to become law in late June.    Diet debate on the budget, which was submitted to parliament  on March 4, has been delayed due to a political squabble over  former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's dubious financial  deals in the past. Hosokawa stepped down in April amid the  turmoil.    The budget bill remained shelved for 80 days in the lower  house Budget Committee before it was approved after 13 days of  discussion.    The nation's full spending plan includes 5.47 trillion yen  in  cuts in income and residential taxes to stimulate the economy.    Despite tight fiscal conditions, expenditures for public  works projects were also increased by a brisk 4.0 percent.    Public works spending accounts for nearly 9 trillion yen of  the 40.85 trillion yen general operating expenditures, the core  part of the budget including most outlays other than debt  serving costs and tax allocations to local governments.    Defense spending, in contrast, was raised by a scant 0.9  percent to 4.68 trillion yen.    Government operations in the current fiscal year has been  financed by an 11.05 trillion yen stopgap budget that became law  on April 1.    The temporary budget will be incorporated into the full  budget.</p>

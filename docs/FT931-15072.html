			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Iceland EEA bid Iceland's President Vigdis Finnbogadottir yesterday signed a law which paves the way for the country to join the European Economic Area (EEA). writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. The move follows parliamentary approval for the decision - by 33 votes to 23 with seven abstentions - on Tuesday night. Iceland, which is a member of the European Free Trade Association (Efta) joins Sweden, Finland, Norway and Austria in seeking to join the EEA, a trade pact grouping EC and Efta countries. It is not seeking to join the EC, partly because of worries over fishing policy.</p>

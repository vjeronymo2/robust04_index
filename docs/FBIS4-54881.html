			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] While world attention has been focused  on developments around the UN-proclaimed safe area of Gorazde,  Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat political leaders have been  engaged in negotiations to fill leadership positions in their  newly established federation. The deadline for electing the  federation's government is drawing near: According to the  federation's constitution, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly is  supposed to reach a decision by 30 April at the latest.    Following three meetings of high-ranking representatives of  the Bosnian Muslim and Croat sides, the Presidential Council of  the Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna blamed the Bosnian Muslims  for a failure to reach a political agreement on the nationality  of the federation's future president, vice president, and prime  minister, accusing the Muslims of an "absolute lack of interest  and readiness" to discuss these issues, Zagreb Radio reported on  26 April.    Describing a 23 April "working meeting" between Bosnian  Croat  and Muslim delegations in Sarajevo, the Belgrade news agency  TANJUG stated the same day that the two sides had failed to  reach an agreement on the future federation president. Citing a  Croatian Radio report, TANJUG said that each side had given  "legal and political" justifications for its candidate. Although  the Croat side wanted a Croat as the first president of the  federation, it was prepared to yield to the Muslims on the  condition that Haris Silajdzic were nominated instead of the  proposed Muslim leader, Alija Izetbegovic. Izetbegovic,  president of Bosnia-Herzegovina, was proposed as candidate for  federation president by "deputies of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Assembly" and by the regional, executive, and main committees of  the Party of Democratic Action [SDA] on 8 April, which cited  "moral and political reasons that are clear to all members and  supporters of our party," according to Sarajevo Radio on 12  April.    The Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] of  Bosnia-Herzegovina  and the Croatian deputies' club in the Assembly have put forward  as their presidential candidate Kresimir Zubak, chairman of the  Presidency of the Croatian Republic of Herceg-Bosna. In an  interview published in the 2-4 April issue of the Zagreb daily  VECERNJI LIST, Zubak said that "we have not only a political,  but also a constitutional right" to elect a Croat to the post of  president because, according to the constitution, the president  cannot be elected from the same people twice in succession, and  "over the past several years this function has been performed by  a member of the Muslim people, namely Alija Izetbegovic."    The Croatian National Council [HNV] of Bosnia-Herzegovina  has  nominated Dr. Ivo Komsic as its presidential candidate.  According to a statement published in the 15 April issue of the  Zagreb daily VJESNIK, Dr. Komsic has met every criterion for  "election to this most responsible post" and has proven his  determination, ability, and readiness "to implement the spirit  and the letter of the new constitution" with his "overall work  and personal contribution" in preparing the Washington agreement  and later the constitution.    An article in the 5 April issue of the Belgrade daily BORBA  observes that Bosnian reporters accredited to Zagreb see  Kresimir Zubak as Croatian President Tudjman's choice for  president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation, adding that at  the same time "the government in Zagreb does not oppose Haris  Silajdzic in some leadership position." The BORBA article also  mentions other presidential candidates whose names are  circulating in Sarajevo, such as Komsic, Vlado Pandzic, and  Stjepan Kljuic, noting that their political views on the future  of Bosnia-Herzegovina are supposed to be closer to Croatian  Assembly President Stipe Mesic's than to Tudjman's.    A 13 April VJESNIK article points out that, in accordance  with the constitution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, the  federation president cannot be chosen by the "simple process" of  the Assembly voting on nominated candidates. The governments of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Herceg-Bosna must agree upon a single  candidate to be presented to the Assembly. To be elected, the  candidate must then get the majority of votes of both the Croat  and Bosnian Muslim representatives. The paper predicts that such  an election will "obviously" entail difficulties.</p>

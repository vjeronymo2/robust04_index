			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Portillo hints at end to universal state pension A CLEAR hint that a future Conservative government might phase out the universal state pension yesterday reopened the debate in Mr John Major's government about the future of the welfare state. Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, warned that on present trends the growth of welfare provision would 'crush' the wealth-creating sectors of the economy. In an interview on BBC Television, the rightwing cabinet minister called also for a greater role for private-sector insurance companies in assuming responsibilities now accepted by the government. Asked about reports that the government wanted to cut the social security budget by obliging home-owners to take out mortgage indemnity insurance, he said: 'I don't believe that the state should be in the business of offering individuals insurance that they could get in the outside world and I think that is one of the areas where we have got to move.' Mr Portillo said the government must seek to tilt back the balance between state and individual responsibility for the well-being of the old. He was careful to stress that the 'entitlements' to state pensions already built up by individuals at work could never be swept away. The government is committed to preserving universal pensions during the present parliament. But he offered a clear hint that those at the beginning of their working careers should be expected to make private provision for their old age. Referring to the expected increase of pensioners to 13m or 14m during the early 21st century, he said: 'I don't think the state can be there to do everything.' Mr Portillo, developing the theme of greater individual responsibility he set out at the Conservative party conference earlier this month, suggested that the reform during the 1980s of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme could be a model for more radical change. He gave implicit backing to the idea that individuals might opt out of the basic state pension as they can now do from Serps. On the National Health Service, the chief secretary said the state would find it impossible to keep up with 'infinite' demand. He said that the government must not be 'dogmatic' about the line between public and private provision. Mr Portillo's remarks drew an immediate attack from Labour which accused him of seeking to undermine the welfare state. Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary, said: 'The crisis that the Conservatives have created in the public finances is now being used as an excuse to press on with their long-term objective of dismantling the welfare state.'

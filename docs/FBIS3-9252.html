			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A meeting of the presidents, vice presidents, and  other representatives of the Social Democracy Party of Romania  [PDSR] branches from 16 counties in Transylvania and Banat took  place in Cluj-Napoca today. The meeting was attended by PDSR  Executive President Adrian Nastase, other members of the Central  Executive Bureau of this political group, members of the  governments, and PDSR senators and deputies.    At a news conference after the meeting, Adrian Nastase said  that the PDSR meeting is indicative of the party's concern with  Transylvania and its problems. He emphasized that his party has  its own position on the issue of national and interethnic  relations. After enumerating certain conclusions he has reached  during his discussions with the economic managers in the county  and with the command of the 4th Army of Transylvania, Adrian  Nastase referred to the meeting's main message, which is that  the PDSR wants to enhance its positions throughout the country,  including in Transylvania, thus rejecting regional approaches to  solving problems and favoring the promotion of a policy in  accordance with the norms of social- democracy and with the  requirements of our country's geostrategic environment.    Adrian Nastase said that Transylvania's problems should be  tackled from an angle indicative of the fact that, generally  speaking, it is up to the country's government to find solutions  to these problems, while the political parties should not play a  mediating role. Selective and biased historism should be  replaced by European standards, while the governmental and state  dimension should play a greater role in tackling Transylvania's  problems.    Adrian Nastase said that PDSR's image should be improved and  its identity as a party clearly brought to the fore. In  conclusion, he said that it is important to unequivocally define  the relationship between the PDSR and the Democratic Union of  Hungarians in Romania [UDMR], particularly since there are  certain UDMR positions that are incompatible with the country's  Constitution and we are faced with a certain ambiguity promoted  by this party.    After his speech, Adrian Nastase answered the questions of  journalists for more than an hour. Among the issues raised, we  would like to mention the following: the local relations between  the PDSR and other parties, particularly the UDMR and the  Romanian National Unity Party [PUNR]; the discussions conducted  by the ruling party with the opposition parties and with the  parties of the governmental arch; and the problems facing the  young generation and ways and means for their resolution.    Answering a question about early elections, Nastase said  that  PDSR considers them a mistake, since they would block the  economic and political mechanisms, something which would have  serious consequences at the domestic and foreign level, our  correspondent Adriana Olteanu reports.</p>

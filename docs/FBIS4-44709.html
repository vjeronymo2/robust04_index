			<p>CSO     [Text] Bonn--German manufacturers are asking the Bonn  government to allocate an extra 570 million German marks [DM]  for development of the European combat plane (Eurofighter),  announced state secretary Jorg Schonbohm 13 April.    The government, Schonbohm added before the parliamentary  defense committee, is prepared to negotiate an additional DM160  million for project modifications and extension of the fighter's  development phase. On the other hand, it has rejected all other  requests, including adjustments for inflation.    Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom agreed to  develop the Eurofighter 2000 in late 1992, as a (30-percent)  less costly alternative to the initially planned European  Fighter Aircraft (EFA). They also agreed to postpone the  aircraft's production phase. The German defense minister already  spurned several manufacturer requests for additional funding  last year.    The government wants to reach an agreement on the question  with participating firms by the end of May, and inform the lower  house of parliament, the Bundestag, of the outcome before  summer. A Eurofighter prototype made its maiden flight on 27  March, over one year behind schedule. Its official presentation  is slated for 4 May. Germany is underwriting one-third of the  project's cost.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Milan Janicina, minister for privatization </F> and the administration of national property, by Ivan Podstupka;  place and date not given: "Enterprises Are Avoiding  Privatization"]    [Text] There is no doubt that privatization is at the  center of the transformation of the economy. After the rapid  start in 1992, its tempo slowed down, and preferences for  individual methods changed. The current government stresses  that all of the privatization methods will be used and that they  will be equal. However, this contradicts the statement provided  by Milan Janicina, the Slovak Republic's minister for the  administration and privatization of national property, that  direct sales will be used only in specific cases.    [Janicina] I meant putting standard and nonstandard methods  on an equal footing. The coupon method is nonstandard, and  there are three standard methods: public auction, public  tender, and sale to a person designated in advance--that is,  direct sales. Public tender is transparent, but direct sales  were, are, and will be a subject for speculation. This is why  we want to restrict it, but we cannot entirely avoid it. All of  the cases so far have involved enterprises in bad economic  situations. We can either launch bankruptcy proceedings against  them, or a prospective buyer will emerge who will pledge to  revive the enterprise. The second case is more advantageous.  Moreover, budget-funded organizations cannot be liquidated. We  have to sell them and also consider the system of installments.  A different case would be to sell it to a solvent foreign  investor. The National Property Fund has obligations and needs  money, and a public tender can take several months. We do not  want to push direct sales into the background, but, within the  standard methods, we want to use them only in justified cases.    [Podstupka] There will be a second wave of coupon  privatization. It will not be easy to raise 88 billion  [korunas] worth of property....    [Janicina] We are short of 37 billion. I believe that we  have time until the end of July to reach this volume. So far,  health facilities, half of the agricultural enterprises, and  some of the Ministry of the Economy's enterprises have not been  included. We are counting on 17 billion worth of property in  energy-generating and gas enterprises, despite the fact that,  according to Minister Magvasi, the privatization of the  energy-generating and gas industry should be organized in a  separate law.    [Podstupka] The positions of your ministry and the Ministry  of the Economy differ. Is it possible to overcome this  difference?    [Janicina] I believe that the difference is not as great as  they say. There are two extreme opinions. According to the  first one, the privatization of the energy-generating and gas  industry means the virtual disintegration of the state, while  the other points to the example of the well-functioning British  private energy-generating and gas industry. It is possible to  agree with Minister Magvasi that our state is young, and  intervention has to be done carefully. This is why  privatization should be implemented gradually. Enterprises  should be transformed into large shareholding companies, which  would then establish branch subsidiaries.    [Podstupka] It is expected that state-owned shareholders'  companies will be anchored in the law....    [Janicina] I have the feeling that this would be a step  backward, a turn toward socialist privatization. We have to  make clear what state ownership participation is. As far as I  know, a certain respectable legal firm is preparing a draft of  this law for the Ministry of the Economy. It is slowly getting  into a legislative and legal shakeup. In no case will this be  easy. The strategic interest of the state can be secured if the  National Property Fund has the controlling volume of shares.  However, the National Property Fund was drafted as a certain  catalyst of privatization and, after privatization is completed,  should wither away. There are fears that it could become a kind  of superministry, a super planning commission, and, moreover, an  entrepreneurial subject with enormous assets. This is a great  danger. This is why it is possible to abolish the National  Property Fund at a certain stage of transformation by  transferring the shares securing strategic interests of the  state to a state body--the Ministry of the Economy, in this  case. I would like to comment here that, on the part of the  Ministry of the Economy of the Slovak Republic, we can feel the  residue of what used to be the "ministerial" attitude: We are  big, and we must control.    [Podstupka] Why are some of these enterprises being  privatized by the coupon method? The state is being deprived of  certain income.    [Janicina] Simply to improve the average quality of shares  that are in coupon privatization. We cannot give only garbage  to the people. The previous government believed the coupon  method was marginal. They were to pick the raisins from the  cake to sell them, and the rest, which no one wanted, would be  put into coupon privatization. This is not what we want. In  the policy statement, the government pledged also to offer  prospering enterprises in coupon privatization, so we have to  fulfill it.    [Podstupka] The second wave of coupon privatization will  begin in the fall--that is, after the elections. Could a change  in political power slow it down, change it, or stop it?    [Janicina] It could theoretically happen that a government  that is completely against coupon privatization would assume  power. Such a government would have problems because it would  discredit itself at home and abroad. It is certain that, if  that government had 90 deputies in parliament, it could order  anything, even a return to socialism. In that case, I would  fear for the fate of coupon privatization.    [Podstupka] Is the Privatization Ministry, after all of the  changes and reorganizations, prepared for the second wave of  coupon privatization?    [Janicina] I believe it is, as regards the personnel. We  have certain problems with founding ministries, particularly  regarding coordination with privatized enterprises. Some  enterprises are doing everything to avoid privatization. They  do not cooperate when completing ownership-related legal  documents, particularly referring to real estate. We must  overcome this. I have issued an order that every enterprise  that is 60-percent prepared must go ahead with privatization.  It will be transformed into a shareholding company, and,  according to Section 15 of the law on large-scale privatization,  the concomitant rights will be transferred onto it.    [Podstupka] Is cooperation with the National Property Fund  all right?    [Janicina] Coordination could be better, but we cannot  complain. It would be better if we had personnel connection  between the National Property Fund management and the ministry.  Not on the ministerial level, but it would be good if we  returned to the situation where the deputy minister was the  chairman of the National Property Fund Presidium.    [Podstupka] What will be the fate of the enterprises whose  decision about direct sale, made by the previous government, was  abolished by the current government?    [Janicina] Developments will tell us whether they will be  sold directly or by public tender. One sale has already been  made--the sale of the Nuclear Power Station Research Institute.  It was sold to the same people to whom it had been sold under  Meciar's government. The project was only completed by missing  data. Despite the fact that my resistance to the Employees'  Stock Ownership Plan for Companies is known, in this case I had  no objections. Only 5 percent will go to the management, and  the rest to other employees.</p>

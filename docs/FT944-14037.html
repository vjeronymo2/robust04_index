			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Singaporeans buy BS stake Scotts Holdings, the Singapore-based property group, has bought the Kerman family's stake in BS Group, the property and leisure company formerly known as Bristol Scotts. Its acquisition of 26.97 per cent of the share capital is the culmination of a long and acrimonious attempt by non-family shareholders to oust the Kermans from BS. In August, Mr Anthony Kerman was deposed as chairman and replaced by Sir Ian Rankin. Mr Kerman, his brother Nicholas and their father Isidore, who has had a large stake in the company since before the second world war, remain directors. But Mr Bryan Burletson, representing Scotts Holdings, said yesterday an agreement of the acquisition was that the Kermans would stand down. He said Scotts would seek board representation. Sir Ian was not involved in Scotts' negotiations with the Kermans. He previously made it clear he would not welcome a transfer of the entire Kerman stake to Scotts because he sought a wider and institutional shareholding. Scotts is quoted on the Singapore stock exchange but is controlled by the Jumabhoy family. Mr Burletson, former chairman and chief executive of Clayform Properties, said he was a friend and business partner of the Jumabhoys. For the past two years they had been looking for a UK company in which to invest. 'We alighted on BS as an interesting company. It had a very good base from which it could expand rapidly.' Scotts is buying 24.88 per cent of the voting shares and all of the non-voting shares in BS. The consideration is 188p a share or Pounds 3.1m. In addition, Mr Burletson said a legal dispute over the ownership of a further 11 per cent of the shares had been settled. Part of these would go to Scotts which, together with other shares it had agreed to buy, would bring its holding to 29.9 per cent. 'We are not interested in making a full bid,' Mr Burletson said. 'We will bring expertise and funding which can only be of enormous benefit to BS, bearing in mind there has been an internal dispute which has completely stultified the company.' BS returned to the black this year for the first time since 1988, with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 429,000 for the six months to June 30.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 21 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  hinted Saturday [21 May] he may consider an opposition proposal  that his minority cabinet resign immediately after the state  budget passes the Diet.    "It is one idea," Hata said.    Hata told reporters that he will meet or talk over the  telephone with Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social  Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan], the  second largest opposition party, who made the suggestion earlier  in the day.    Meanwhile, chief cabinet secretary Hiroshi Kumagai told  reporters that the cabinet will take Kubo's proposal seriously.    Kubo, in a meeting in China with Japanese reporters  traveling  with him, said that the Hata cabinet should resign en masse soon  after the fiscal 1994 budget bills are approved by the Diet, and  before the opposition camp submits a no-confidence motion.    Kubo said the SDP may seek a no-confidence vote if Hata  refuses to step down. The possibility of an SDP no-confidence  motion would be "very high" if the Hata cabinet does not resign  en masse, he said.</p>

The fine  weather over France did not make for a large-scale turnout.  Some 58 percent of those eligible actually cast a vote, as  opposed to 60.40 percent on 20 March, the rural population  showing itself to be considerably more "civic minded" than urban  voters    However, more than two-thirds of the seats remained in very  tight run-off situations (1,372 as opposed to 2,028 in mainland  France and the overseas territories): Just 21 were fought for  by a single candidate, 132 by three candidates, six by four  candidates, and one by five candidates (Molieres in the  Tarn-et-Garonne department), all the rest being head-to-head  confrontations.    This second round, moreover, was not, far from it, without  political significance, even after a first round which had  indicated better than any opinion poll the current balance of  power between the moderate right (44.59 percent) and the left  (40.40 percent), and the National Front with 9.7 percent and the  ecologists with just 3.5 percent. The majority therefore did a  little better than in the first round (44.2 percent) of the  legislative elections of March 1993. That allowed Edouard  Balladur to say yesterday that "confidence in the government and  its majority had been confirmed." The Socialists and other  parties on the Left, with 29 percent of the vote, garnered five  points less than in the previous local elections of 1988, but  won back nine points over their disastrous result at the  legislative elections.    The stakes of the second round, over and above the seats  that  were being fought, was the control of several regional councils.  The Right, which had already held 75 of these councils, hoped it  could win another three or four. Its gains (only the Creuse  region) were more modest... The Left, which had held just 29  regional councils (including Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne  held by the Communist party), had several departments in its  sights. It thus won the Dordogne, the island of Reunion, and  the Gironde.    Vaucluse and Upper Corsica stayed with the Right, while Tam,  Cotes d'Armor, and the territory of Belfort all went to the Left.    In addition to these direct stakes, there were what could  termed the particular centers of interest of this second round:  the fate of various political personalities (Bernard Tapie in  Marseilles, Jean-Louis Bianco in Digne, Olivier Stern in Vire,  Jean-Marie Bockel in Mulhouse, who were all elected; while  Elisabeth Guigou in Avignon, Maurice Arreckx in Toulon, Brice  Lalonde in Dinard, Jean-Francois Poncet in Laplume were  beaten...), the solidity of the Right-Left "republican front"  against the National Front [FN] (especially in Provence; Cote  d'Azur; Dreux, where Marie-France Stirbois beat the outgoing  Socialist; and in Creil, where Ernest Cheniere, the FN-backed  Rally for the Republic [RPR] man, was beaten), the internal  competition within the moderate right (the French Democratic  Union, UDF, and the RPR were in opposition in some 20  constituencies), etc.    Moreover, beyond the stakes and these centers of particular  interest, this second round of local elections gave an initial  indication of the results of next year's municipal elections.  Everyone thinks spontaneity in Marseilles (Bernard Tapie fully  intends continuing this "love story"), but in many other towns,  mostly held by the Left, the majorities are fragile or unsure:  Bourgas, Gueret, Valence, Thionville, Mulhouse, etc.    In the first round you choose, in the second round you  eliminate. This old adage of the two-round majority-based  electoral systems has once again been confirmed. The voter who,  on 20 March, had voted essentially from political motives, as  closely as possible to his convictions and wishes, did not  hesitate yesterday to vote for personalities, with the clear aim  of knocking out those candidates he felt furthest from. This  behavior is traditionally adopted by the parties of the Left.  This is the celebrated "republican discipline" which, beginning  with the evening of the first round, consists of standing down  in favor of the candidate on one's own side who is better  placed. Generally speaking, this principle has been respected,  with fewer than 12 "smudgers." This undoubtedly explains the  beginning of the recovery confirmed yesterday.    Such acts of "spontaneous standing down" do not come as  naturally to the Right. Competition between the RPR and UDF has  not always made it possible to avoid breaches, which has not  been without consequences at times, either for the fate of a  constitutency or for the fate of a presidency of a regional  council.    These cases of disciplinary violations are most often to be  appreciated as a function of the local context, the personality  of the candidates who have remained, and what can be called  small-town feuds. However, they must also be examined in the  light of a not insignificant amplifying factor: The attitude of  those who, in the first round, voted for National Front  candidates.    Although it was present in only 92 constituencies in the  second round (less than one out of 14), the National Front had a  noticeable effect on the vote. By holding a space in 41  "three-candidate" contests, these candidates allowed the Left in  some places to either keep a seat or gain one. In those  constituencies where it was no longer represented, its  first-round electors did not all transfer their votes to a  candidate of the Right.    The hardening of the National Front was not completely  unforeseen: Its score in the first round only allowed it to  hope for a very small number of victories, i.e., less than five.  So it had to make its presence felt some other way!</p>

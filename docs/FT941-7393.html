			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Inflation index to form new Brazilian currency Brazil is next week expected to announce the first steps towards a new currency to replace the inflation-plagued cruzeiro real. The move is part of an economic stabilisation plan launched by Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the finance minister, aimed at tackling Brazil's annual inflation of about 2,500 per cent. Mr Cardoso is to launch the Unidade Real de Valor (URV), an inflation index which will eventually form the basis of a new currency. Brazil uses several indices to adjust prices and salaries regularly for inflation. But they measure past inflation and often add to present expectations of price rises. The government hopes its new index will eliminate such 'inertial' inflation by stressing current rather than past price rises. The value of the URV, linked to the US dollar, will be announced daily by the central bank. The government hopes that businesses will quickly switch from using cruzeiros to URVs and that the country will be able to move entirely to the new unit later this year. The government has yet to explain many of the details of the new unit or whether its adoption will be compulsory. Workers groups are concerned that salaries will be converted into URVs on unfavourable terms, leading to a sudden fall in purchasing power. Uncertainty about the government's intentions contributed to a sell-off on the stock market, down more than 7 per cent at one stage yesterday. It was blamed on rumours - which were denied - that the government was planning temporarily to block foreign capital inflows. Foreign investors have helped push the market to record levels this year.</p>

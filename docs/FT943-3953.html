			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Housing groups may be given credit ratings The largest and strongest housing associations rank with larger property investment companies and middle-ranking building societies as investment opportunities, says a report published today by a credit-rating organisation. IBCA says that credit rating would give the larger, soundly financed associations ratings in the single-A range. Such ratings would make it easier for them to raise private finance to top up government grants for building low-cost housing. However, it warns that the attractiveness of associations to investors could be reduced by further cuts in government grants or by significant reductions in housing benefit. Mr Jonathan Aitken, chief secretary to the Treasury, warned last week that he would target housing benefit in the autumn public-expenditure round after steep rises in the bill over recent years. Housing benefit helps low-income households pay their rent, and is seen by investors as underpinning associations' income streams. Attempting to reduce the benefit at the same time as cutting grants is likely to produce severe strains in the sector, it says. The Housing Corporation, the quango that distributes government grant to associations, estimates that associations will need to raise Pounds 7bn on the capital markets over the next three years. Those which achieved investment-grade ratings would be able to draw on a much wider investor base and cut the cost of borrowing. IBCA says that it would be prepared to rate associations and also the debenture issues undertaken by groups of associations. While the sector is closely regulated by the Housing Corporation, this would not protect creditors in all circumstances, according to IBCA. There is also a danger that greater competition for government grants - or fears that grants may be harder to get in the future - will lead associations into uneconomic development.

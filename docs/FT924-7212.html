			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Ex-Bupa staff challenge court move A COMPANY formed by redundant staff of Bupa, Britain's largest private healthcare group, will this week seek to overturn a court order secured by their former employer, Alan Pike writes. First Choice Health launched its Pure Health Plan - described as offering 'enhanced private medical cover for competitive premiums' - on November 2. The following day, Bupa obtained a High Court order allowing it to search the new company's offices. A statement from First Choice Health yesterday said that its offices in London, Beckenham and Bradford were raided simultaneously by Bupa on November 4 'to search for evidence to substantiate suspicions by Bupa that First Choice Health had been acting in breach of confidentiality in obtaining business'. It added that Bupa's suspicions were groundless, and that it was applying to have the court order overturned. It would also seek costs and damages for interference with its business. Bupa confirmed that it had obtained the order 'to prevent misuse of Bupa confidential information'.</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> 147-UNIT CONDO PROJECT APPROVED  </P> <P> The City Council this week approved the construction of a 147-condominium  project in the Santiago Hills area of east Orange.  </P> <P> The condominiums, ranging in size from 1,780 to 2,526 square feet, will be  built on 11 acres northeast of the intersection of White Oak Ridge and Old Camp  Road.  </P> <P> The two-story condominiums will be built above garages that are partially below  ground level. A spokesman for Pulte Home Corp. of Newport Beach said  construction is scheduled to begin next fall and be completed in about two  years.  </P> <P> Although there was no formal objection to the plan, resident Bob Bennyhoff said  he is concerned that the condominiums, in effect, will be three-story buildings  in an area that has a two-story limit.  </P> <P> "It's cheating, legal cheating," he said.  </P> <P> But Jack McGee, director of community development, said the buildings qualify  as two-story structures under the city's building code.  </P></p>

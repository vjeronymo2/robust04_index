			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Party Views on Hungary's NATO </F> Membership -- Do You Approve of Hungary's NATO Membership  Request? If You Do, When Will This Issue Be Timely, and Which  Forum Should Decide on Entering It?"]    [Text] Gyula Thurmer, Workers' Party: The  Workers' Party does not approve of Hungary's membership in NATO;  in fact, it opposes it in any form. In Parliament, we will  propose that Hungary leave the Partnership for Peace program and  send home the AWACS planes and all foreign soldiers who are  stationed in Hungary. The NATO issue will have to be taken to a  referendum immediately after the May elections.    Zsolt Rajkai, United Smallholders Party: We  approve of Hungary's intention of gaining NATO membership. Our  NATO membership is a timely issue already now. Hungary's  sovereignty has two possibilities, either neutrality or  membership in a military bloc. Obviously, it is not enough for a  country to declare its neutrality; worldwide guarantees are also  needed for this. However, this is not a well-founded hope.  Therefore, it is our vital interest to belong to a military  bloc. At the same time, we would consider a pan- European  military cooperation agreement ideal. In addition to NATO  membership, our efforts are directed toward this.    Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, Alliance of Free Democrats  [SZDSZ]: For the SZDSZ, Hungary's NATO membership is a  strategic goal. It is our vital interest to integrate ourselves  organically in the European and Euro-Atlantic organizations.  NATO is not exclusively a defense organization, it is also a  forum for security policy and foreign policy coordination. Our  membership is also important for the reason that, in addition to  the European member states, it also ensures links with the  United States and Canada.    A period of preparations is needed for full membership and  the Partnership for Peace program is a good opportunity for  this. We would like to achieve full membership in a few years'  time.    We do not think a referendum on our membership is vitally  important; however, we will not reject it if there is a broad  demand for this in society.    Lajos Horvath, Hungarian Justice and Life Party  [MIEP]: Yes, the MIEP approves of Hungary's request for  NATO membership. This would bring significant political,  economic, and military advantages for Hungary. It would mean a  much quicker access to the various orgnizations of the world,  and the extension of the NATO umbrella over Hungary. Due to  Hungary's economic and military political situation, all these  are clearly needed. At the same time, we have to recognize the  fact that NATO membership would have all kinds of consequences,  and meeting the various requirements would entail much sacrifice  from the people. For this reason, only a referendum can decide  this issue. The time: as soon as possible. However, full  membership is only a desirable goal at the moment, and before  this can be achieved, we have to concentrate on building a  strong economy and a combat-worthy army.    Ferenc Inotay, Christian Democratic People's  Party:    1. I approve of and agree with Hungary's membership in NATO.  Effectively, Hungary's security is not guaranteed by anything  other than a promise to help, on the level of sympathy. Our  NATO membership will document the 1,000-year-old fact that  Hungary is part of the Western Christian world. For the peoples  of the Carpathian basin, NATO membership will result in reducing  tensions (that have been simmering underground since the end of  World War I), and in creating peace in the minds of people of  various native languages and nationalities. NATO membership  will also ensure technical development for Hungary both in the  military and in the civilian production spheres.    2. To the timeliness, my answer is that it would have  already been good yesterday, but today is not too late, either.  NATO membership is not attractive for the remaining domestic  leadership or that in the neighboring countries which was  brought up on Soviet world-dominating ideas; therefore, these  leaders do all they can to delay it as much as possible or  cancel it altogether. It is also urgent to achieve NATO  membership to nullify this influence and make it impossible.  The revival of the imperial and power attitude in Russia, which  endangers us as well as NATO, can speed up the approval of our  NATO membership and can make it cheaper. Due to our  geopolitical situation, our membership will also be in the  interest of NATO. If we cannot bear the financial burdens of an  early NATO membership, NATO might take on these financial  burdens in the form of aid, and turn it into the financing of a  NATO interest, which will make this more likely.    3. Hungary's NATO membership is a decision of great  importance and a commitment that will determine our future for a  long time; therefore, it can only be decided in a general  referendum.    Szabolcs Baross, Republic Party: At the moment,  all European and transatlantic organizations and institutions  are in a state of flux. For us, there is no alternative to the  European Community as an economic integration. However, in the  view of the Republic Party, out of the security policy  organizations -- NATO and the Western European Union -- it would  be too soon to institutionalize our contacts with either of  them. Rather, we should concentrate on establishing our ability  as soon as possible to link to the already existing  organizations and the possibly emerging new cooperations.    In our view, membership in the big integrations is a major  issue that requires a referendum.    Zoltan Kiraly, Social Democratic Party of Hungary:  For the country's security, the most important task is to  improve and deepen the economic, political, and cultural links  with the neighboring countries and the states of the  Central-Eastern European region in a broader sense, and where  this is not possible, continuously to handle the conflict.    In our view, relations with NATO are an important element of  Hungarian security policy, but we reject all such attempts that  would suggest the shifting of responsibility to somewhere else,  in other words, attempts that "seek protection from others"  instead of trying to solve the undoubtedly complicated problems.    It is timely to establish political and professional  contacts  with NATO, but not membership. A referendum will have to decide  on membership.</p>

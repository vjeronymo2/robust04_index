In his turn, V. Birkavs stressed that Latvia is going  through  a difficult, transitional period in its development now. It is  made even more complicated by difficulties in its relations with  Russia. Nevertheless, the head of the Latvian Government said,  the people of the Latvian Republic believe in the prospects for  democratic development in the country and hope for the support  of other nations. Latvia has firmly declared its intent to  gradually become a member of the European Union and to join  international security structures. In this connection, the  prime minister of Latvia asked the Netherlands for support.    Today, the sides signed two agreements -- on avoiding dual  taxation and on protecting investments. V. Birkavs expressed  the hope that even more important bilateral economic agreements  would be drawn up soon.</p>

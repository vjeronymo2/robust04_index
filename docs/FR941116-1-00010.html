The proposed regulation would require State highway agencies (SHA) to establish and administer VE programs; it outlines minimum VE program requirements and provides guidance in establishing, administering, and monitoring a VE program. This proposed regulation is considered necessary to implement 23 U.S.C. 106(d), which provides that, in such cases as the Secretary deems advisable, the Secretary may require a value engineering or other cost reduction analysis of plans, specifications, and estimates for proposed projects on any Federal-aid highway.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before January 17, 1995.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit written and signed comments to the Federal Highway Administration, HCC&hyph;10, FHWA Docket No. 94&hyph;12, Room 4232, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, D.C. 20590.

This document solicits public comments regarding the VE requirements being considered by the FHWA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1991, the Congress required the FHWA to study its VE program. Section 1091 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, Public Law 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914 (Dec 18, 1991), required the Secretary of Transportation to ``study the effectiveness and benefits of value engineering review programs applied to Federal-aid highway projects,'' and to ``report to Congress on the results of the study *&blank;*&blank;* including recommendations on how value engineering could be utilized and improved in Federal-aid highway projects.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA's evaluation of the effectiveness of its VE program, as described in a report submitted to Congress in June 1993, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  concluded that the application of VE in the development of highway projects has the potential to result in substantial cost savings without adversely affecting any of the highway projects' design, aesthetics, or construction standards while assuring that environmental and ecological goals are maintained. During the study made to prepare this report, the FHWA examined VE data covering fiscal year (FY) 1988 to FY 1991 and found that only a limited number of States had active and effective VE programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Value Engineering on Federal-aid Projects,'' a report to Congress by the Secretary of Transportation is available for inspection and copying as prescribed in 49 CFR part 7 appendix D. A copy is in the file for FHWA Docket No. 94&hyph;12.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The study found that FHWA's policy of the past 20 years of promoting VE through education, encouragement, and technical assistance has had limited success in persuading all States to implement VE programs on a continuing basis. This finding is despite overwhelming evidence that VE can be a very effective way to improve projects and control costs from States with active VE programs. The FHWA has, therefore, concluded that in order to improve the effectiveness of the VE program nationwide, all States need to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have active VE programs. As a result, the FHWA proposes to require the use of VE in all States on selected Federal-aid highway projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / US taxation legislator denies allegations of postal embezzlement MR DAN Rostenkowski, the most powerful tax legislator in the US Congress, broke his silence this weekend to defend himself against allegations of embezzlement. He had made no comment all week after Mr Robert Rota, former head of the post office at the House of Representatives, pleaded guilty to charges of helping two congressmen to embezzle money through his office. Mr Rota identified only Congressmen A and B in his plea, but the dates and amounts of payments listed in documents filed with the court match payments made to Mr Rostenkowski, a Chicago Democrat, and to Mr Joe Kolter, a Pennsylvania Democrat, these being detailed in earlier public documents. On Saturday, however, Mr Rostenkowski hired new lawyers to defend himself and called a news conference on Capitol Hill to deny 'the many unfair, false and baseless allegations that have been made recently about me.' Mr Rostenkowski went on: 'I am presumed to be innocent. I have been charged with nothing. But, most importantly, I am in fact innocent of any wrongdoing.' Mr Robert Bennett, who will now handle Mr Rostenkowski's defence in tandem with Mr Carl Rauh, has defended clients such as Mr Casper Weinberger, former defence secretary, and Mr Robert Altman, now on trial in New York in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International case. As chairman of the House Ways and Means committee, Mr Rostenkowski holds sway over all tax legislation in Congress. He and Senator Pat Moynihan, chairman of the Senate finance committee, are the key negotiators in the effort to craft a bill that would reconcile the different budgets recently passed by the House and the Senate. Mr Rostenkowski is one of the very few powerful Democrats in Comgress who has shown any willingness to help President Bill Clinton get his economic programme passed. The chairman is leading the search for a compromise on energy taxation that would take into account the Senate's rejection of a broad tax levied on the thermal content of all forms of energy, but would raise more money than the simple petrol tax of 4.3 cents a gallon voted by the Senate. Having failed to win Senate negotiators over to the idea of adding a utilities tax to the petrol tax, Mr Rostenkowski is now proposing to lift the petrol tax in stages to 9 cents a gallon. Congressional aides expect a final agreement at 6 to 7 cents a gallon; White House officials appear to have accepted that.</p>

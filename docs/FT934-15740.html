			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Fashion: A small degree of formality - Nigel Spivey checks out the sartorial students in the class of '93 STUDENTS IN the class of '93 are smarter than their predecessors. That is broadly the consensus from High Table, though it requires immediate qualification. Senior dons can remember beyond the sartorially-disastrous 1960s to an age when the suit and tie were not hallmarks of the prig or the fogey but normal student uniform. Cambridge town had a rich weave of gentlemen's outfitters, whose very names evoked a certain style. One can readily imagine what sort of clothes would come out of a shop called Bodger's. But Bodger's is gone, and so too the concept of the 'young gentleman'. Elderly dons may bemoan the loss, but townsfolk tend not to regret the passing of all the associated snobbery. Certainly today's undergraduates are better presented than they were in my time. Then it was not unusual for characters to slouch into a lecture-room wearing only a black plastic binliner (and a torn binliner at that). It was the eve of Margaret Thatcher's first election victory: and punk flourished in all its reckless plumage. A decade and a half of Conservatism has dampened the spirit of adventure, though some residual traces of punk survive. I have a soft spot for a tiny tribe called the Goths, who specialise in entirely black garments and cascades of pewter jewellery worn over shockingly pallid skin. Then there is Grunge: a sort of gaudy drabness, if that makes sense, which is favoured by what little remains of the student activist movement. It features clumpy, cushion-soled footwear, vaguely ethnic skirts and drapes, and beaded neo-hippy hairstyles. At its best Grunge seems like a glorious plundering of a dressing-up box; at its worst, the wearer looks the sort who probably ought to be arrested on sight. Categorisation of degree choices by external appearance is still possible. The Heavy Metal or Tolkien T-shirt worn over chronically-hunched shoulders invariably indicates the male computer scientist. And the fragrant assemblage of boots, jodhpurs, hacking jacket and Florentine silk scarf can only belong to a female art historian. However, the prevalent style is easily described by those dons who have visited American Ivy League universities: 'Preppy', a generally sporty look which simply requires loafers or deck-shoes at the base, designer jeans in the middle, and something loose fitting on top. Oh, and a suntan. Simple, and studiously casual, but not cheap, as anyone who has ventured to gain a suntan or buy a pair of Timberlands will know. Preppy is not a look that can be cobbled together from the Oxfam charity shops. But it is significant that Oxfam shops in many university towns now specialise in selling almost pristine formal evening wear. The generation of the 1950s which bequeathed its ball gowns and dinner jackets to Oxfam must be gratified to see their adoption by Thatcher's proteges. Smart casual may be the order of the day, but smart formal has made a remarkable return for the night. Bodger's may have gone, but blue-blooded elegance is not dead.</p>

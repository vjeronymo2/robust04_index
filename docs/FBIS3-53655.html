			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Moti Bassok: "A Shot Aimed at Three </F> Directions"]    [Text] Just when the U.S. peace delegation in Israel was  trying to convince the top security echelon and the general  public that the new al-Asad is interested in real peace, the  prime minister yesterday surprised the political establishment  with his suggestion to hold a referendum.    Rabin's initiative is directed at three targets: Hafiz  al-Asad, the United States, and Israeli public opinion. The  message to al-Asad is simple: We heard from the Americans that  you are under pressure and would like to achieve peace this  year. If this is so, you had better moderate your demands,  otherwise we will have to appeal to Israeli public opinion,  which would lengthen the process. The Americans told us you are  familiar with the Israeli political scene. You are certainly  aware of the massive opposition among the Israeli public to any  concession on the Golan Heights, and certainly to the total  concession you are demanding.    The message to the U.S. president and secretary of state is  unequivocal: The Sinai withdrawal precedent, UN Resolutions 242  and 338, and mainly the tough Syrian position, could force  Israel to concede the entire Golan Heights contrary to vital  security interests. This is a difficult, exceptional,  sensitive, and complicated issue. Such an issue obliges every  prime minister in any democracy to seek the public's opinion.  The public could give Syria a negative answer. If you -- like  us -- fear such an answer, you can make good use of your direct  channel to al-Asad.    Rabin's message to the Israeli public is this: I understand  you and will try to get the best deal for you. Let me work  quietly; stop demonstrating. I got your message. We will try  to get the best possible peace agreement, but eventually we will  leave the decision in your hands.</p>

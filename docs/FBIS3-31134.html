			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Stevan Cordas: "Ultimatum -- An Introduction </F> Into Aggression"; "pool" item]    [Text] Belgrade, Feb 10 (TANJUG) -- Without a clear and  separate decision of the Security Council NATO air strikes on  artillery positions around Sarajevo would constitute an  aggression on Bosnia, which was recognised as a sovereign state  by the very countries who are members of the alliance,  diplomatic circles in Belgrade stated concerning the ultimatum  endorsed by the North Atlantic Council in Brussels on Wednesday.    NATO threatened to use air power against Bosnian Serbs if  they did not withdraw their heavy artillery to 20 kilometers  from the center of Sarajevo within ten days. At the same time,  NATO called for the Moslem heavy artillery to be placed under  the control of the U.N.    The same circles quote Chapter Seven of the UN Charter which  clearly states that actions, like those supported by the North  Atlantic Council, could be undertaken only in the event of  aggression of one state against another and if they jeopardize  peace and security in the world.    Civil war is therefore not mentioned in this case and the  international community has determined that the conflict that  has been raging between the local Serbs, Croats and Moslems in  the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina for almost  two years is a civil war.    If the UN Charter was to be observed to the letter NATO  could  be declared an aggressor against whom the international  community would have to take decisive actions because, according  to numerous world analysts, the use of air strikes on positions  around Sarajevo could jeopardize peace and international  stability.    By taking these decisions NATO has not only addressed an  ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs but has also shown its readiness  for retaliation. The UN Charter, however, does not recognize  retaliation as justified and describes it as aggression.    As far as the ultimatum is concerned, the Belgrade  diplomatic  circles consider that it is in fact a form of planned political  pressure on the Bosnian Serbs ahead of the fresh round of peace  talks due to start Thursday afternoon.    The NATO officials' interpretation of the three Security  Council Resolutions 824, 836 and 844, which according to them  provide sufficient legal foundations for action without Security  Council approval, is not accepted in Belgrade. Belgrade points  to the possibility of an arbitrary interpretation of these  resolutions due to their generalized content.    At the same time Belgrade recalls the official positions of  the two permanent members of the Security council, Russia and  China, which are opposed to air strikes.    Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin said in  Moscow Thursday that the NATO ultimatum could not be accepted  and said that it is not NATO's job to take such a decision,  especially not about the use of force.    How NATO will act remains to be seen.    It is nevertheless clear that NATO has decided to adopt a  high-risk policy which was confirmed by Boris Yeltsin's  spokesman Anatoliy Kraskov who quoted the Russian president's  warning in Moscow Wednesday that medicine should not be worse  than the malady.</p>

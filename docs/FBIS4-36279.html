			<p>BFN     [Text] Qatari Television last night carried an interview  with Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, member of the Presidential  Council. In the interview al-Zandani expressed the Yemeni  people's appreciation for the State of Qatar and the brotherly  people who proved that they support the right, principles, and  unity of Yemen. He said the Yemeni people will never forget this  noble and fraternal position of our brothers in Qatar.    The brother Presidential Council member said that countries  which respect their pledges and agreements, maintain their  credibility, and are eager to preserve security and peace are  the ones that supported Yemeni unity, and continue to adopt the  same position.    On the allegations that what is going on in Yemen is a  sectarian conflict, Shaykh al-Zandani explained that the Yemenis  are one people with one religion, and that there are no sects in  Yemen. He said our people lived under the brotherhood of Islam  for more than 1,000 years and that colonialism was responsible  for dividing the country. As for the sectarian or racial calls,  they have been incited by the secessionists in the Socialist  Party with the aim of dismantling the unity of the Yemeni people.    He said we consider these calls as having foreign political  motives and that they are paid for in order to terminate unity,  but the secessionists only reaped disappointment. Our Yemeni  people and all their groups and governorates are standing  against the clique that rebelled against our people and carried  weapons in their faces to incite a rift.    On the Security Council resolution, he said the government  appreciates the resolution and announced that it will deal with  the resolution in a positive manner, and will cooperate with the  international envoy and the fact-finding mission. He said we  are satisfied because the Security Council resolution has  tackled the problem as a united political entity that is the  Republic of Yemen, and we hope that the United Nations will be  able to understand what is going on in Yemen.</p>

			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SAN GABRIEL;  </P> <P> SEARCHING FOR ILLEGAL SIGNS  </P> <P> City officials on the lookout for illegal business signs are conducting a  street-by-street review to track them down.  </P> <P> Authorities estimate that as many as two out of every five signs in San Gabriel  violate city standards.  </P> <P> As part of a five-month review process, owners of businesses with offending  signs are being notified and asked to make changes.  </P> <P> Last May, the City Council revised its sign regulations in hopes of achieving  greater uniformity and better aesthetics. Roof signs, pole signs and animated  signs were outlawed.  </P> <P> Code enforcement officer Anthony Estrada said an earlier survey of the city's  1,821 signs found that more than 700 violated the law. Seventy signs had been  abandoned.  </P> <P> Estrada said the city is first trying a cooperative approach. "We're trying to  work with people," he said. "We're not trying to lay down the heavy arm of the  law."  </P> <P> But, he warned, for owners who don't change illegal signs, "there will come a  time, in a month or two, when we may declare some of these signs as public  nuisances."  </P></p>

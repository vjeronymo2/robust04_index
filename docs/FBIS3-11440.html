			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Daniel Oliva, attorney for the family of </F> Jean Paul Genie, by unidentified reporter; from the "Five  O'Clock Sharp" newscast]    [Text] [Reporter] Dr. Oliva what is the status of the  Genie case after General Humberto Ortega appeared before the  military [word indistinct]? Go ahead, Doctor.    [Oliva] Gen. Humberto Ortega arrived in the Judge Advocate's  office today to testify [declaracion indagatoria], that is, he  was considered to be a suspect [reo]. We expected Gen. Ortega  to deny the charges or try to refute them with some kind of  evidence. We never expected him to use this kind of sophistry.  He claimed that he could not remember events or dates and that  he knew nothing about other events because he had only learned  that a young man named Jean Paul Genie had died during an attack  by armed men at 2047 on 28 October. Gen. Ortega claimed that at  0800 on 29 October he had already organized a commission  comprised of high-ranking Army officers to conduct an  investigation.    This commission was only created because someone had already  said that the general's motorcade was the only one involved in  the case. This commission did not allow any authority --  civilian or military, that is, the police -- to enter Complex  003 to conduct investigations. This commission acted as a  retaining wall to prevent any data at Complex 003 from appearing  on a police report. [words indistinct] when he was asked whether  Colonel [name indistinct] informed him in the commission's  report that the log book, which contain information on the  arrivals and departures of Renegade jeeps at Complex 003 and  that there was a time entry that left no doubt that the  motorcade could not have been at the site of the events.    That log book, however, was incinerated, and Gen. Ortega  does  not know that this book was incinerated even today. We did not  expect this. This is unheard-of. Who could believe that they  destroyed a book that contains the evidence, and that the  parties that would have benefited from that evidence authorized  its destruction.    Obviously, all these negative aspects contribute to  reinforcing the presumption that all the accused, that is, the  members of the motorcade and Humberto Ortega, are guilty. After  testifying, Gen. Ortega was obviously considered a suspect, and  a provisional arrest warrant was issued for him. This warrant,  however, was replaced with house arrest. In other words, Gen.  Ortega is under arrest in his house for 10 days or until the  sentence is handed down.    [Reporter] Dr. Oliva, in view of this house arrest for Gen.  Ortega, can he continue as Army chief?    [Oliva] No, no, impossible.    He has already said he would place himself at the disposal  of the Attorney General's Office, which ordered his arrest. The  Attorney General's Office has ordered Gen. Ortega to remain at  his residence, with the limitations facing every arrested  criminal.    [Reporter] What is next in this process [proceso] against  Ortega?    [Oliva] Many witnesses have yet to testify. Many of them  have not appeared in court or have not been located.  Undoubtedly, we were unable to locate certain witnesses,  because they are afraid, went into hiding. Others fear giving a  deposition in which they will adversely affect such powerful a  man.    [Reporter] What is your opinion on the person who is  handling  this process at the military inspector's office?    [Oliva] Hello? Hello?    [Reporter] What is your opinion or view on the person who is  working at the military inspector's office on this process which  began today and lasted more than five hours?    [Oliva] So far the prosecutors have simply handled the  proceedings of the corresponding questions and answers. It  cannot be said these officials have violated the law. The basic  thing is to wait for the Attorney General's Office to write its  final report and issue its judgment, to see whether the accused  are sent to prison or the case against them is dismissed.    [Reporter] Can this provisional arrest of Ortega be  indefinite? What is the situation?    [Oliva] No. This arrest cannot last for more than 10 days.  If after 10 days the investigation has not been completed,  Ortega will be ordered released on bail. If the report has been  completed, a definite ruling will be issued.    [Reporter] What is the situation of the Inter-American Human  Rights Commission in the Genie case?    [Oliva] They are waiting to learn if legal provisions or  human rights are being violated in this process; in case this is  true, they will naturally sanction not only the Nicaraguan  Government but will issue an opinion stating clearly the  responsibility of the accused.</p>

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Outlook for jobs improves sharply A strong improvement in job prospects is reported today in Manpower UK's latest survey, with a marked recovery in London. Only the north-east region estimates any decrease in employment prospects in the next three months. The most positive growth in new job expectations is in the east Midlands, followed by western England and East Anglia. London records the best level of job prospects for four years. The survey shows a significant increase in the employment trend in manufacturing, with a strong showing in vehicle manufacture, and electrical and electronic engineering. Net jobs growth is also predicted in private-sector and public-sector construction, insurance, hotels and catering, and retail distribution. Only five sectors are expected to record a net fall in job prospects - energy and water services, local government, healthcare, banking and textile manufacture. Ms Lilian Bennett, head of Manpower UK, said yesterday: 'It is encouraging to see the improved trend of the first quarter is continuing and the survey confirms our experience in the marketplace.' The survey is based on responses from more than 2,100 leading employers. About 22 per cent of them forecast job increases and 12 per cent job losses, resulting in a 10 per cent positive net balance.

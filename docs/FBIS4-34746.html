			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 22 Jun (PL) -- Addressing attendees of a  conference, which closed today, sponsored by the British  publishing house THE ECONOMIST, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina invited those countries that had the courage to vote  against the U.S. embargo to invest in Cuba.    The minister, who said Cuba "works with determination,"  admitted the U.S. Administration "does what it can rather than  what it wants" regarding Cuba, and he characterized this  government as being less aggressive than that of its Republican  predecessors.    Mentioning the critical economic situation, Robaina said  there is nothing more tense or a greater challenge in Cuba today  than a housewife trying to prepare breakfast, lunch, and dinner  for her family. He said the country is living and changing,  however.    Robaina said those of the new generation, which includes  half  the Cuban population, have their goals and desires, but they  dream with their feet firmly planted on the ground. "Twice we  removed forms of government and mechanisms that did not conform  to our reality. We have had this experience for the second  time." He said he hopes the changes will be implemented as  rapidly as possible "because we Cubans are the most interested  in eliminating shortages."    Robaina told the more than 170 businessmen and bankers  attending the event that Cuba "is not interested in other people  sharing their views but, rather, in these views being considered  when Cuba is discussed." He added: "Most of those who invest in  Cuba are neither for nor against our economic model, but they  are tired of hearing predictions that the Cuban Government will  collapse, predictions which do not happen."    Robaina also said: "The mere fact that you are present here  and helping us look at our situation from a different angle is  an indication of the changes and credibility of our project.  You are already part of that miracle."    The participants of the event will attended a reception  tonight, offered by the Cuban Government.</p>

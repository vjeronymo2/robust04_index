			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Leading Article: The French referendum IN HIS long and remarkable career, Francois Mitterrand can never have taken a gamble more important, or more daring, than the referendum on the Maastricht treaty. If the 'oui' vote wins, and particularly if that victory is by a large margin, ratification will at least be relaunched, though the treaty will remain far from safe harbour. If it is to be 'non', the Maastricht treaty will have been sunk, with incalculable consequences for the future of Europe. If the president's ambition was merely to discomfort his conservative opponents, it was a grievous fault and grievously does he - and France  - seem likely to answer for it. But the referendum had a higher justification and a nobler purpose. The Maastricht treaty did, indeed, need to be reaffirmed by one of Europe's great nations if it was to regain the momentum lost when the Danes voted against it last June. Such a reaffirmation may not now be forthcoming. Some might view that possible outcome as simply a sad result of Mr Mitterrand's hubris and the periodic French impulse towards regicide. But all of Europe's leaders would bear more responsibility for a 'non' than that. The case that they needed to make was that the European Union would underpin prosperity and security in the new Europe. Unfortunately, perhaps unfairly, failures in the former Yugoslavia have identified the EC too closely with a lack of security. Equally, because of the ERM, many Europeans have come to associate the EC with deflation rather than prosperity. Errors have been made, both outside the treaty and within the treaty itself. But the errors are not large enough to justify its downfall. The Maastricht treaty is the culmination of 40 years of European construction. It is certainly the culmination of 10 years of successful efforts to relaunch the EC and of four years of particularly intense discussion of economic and monetary union. Rejection by France, one of the two central pillars of the EC, would bring that forward march to an abrupt halt, for years, possibly forever. It could lead to a relapse into unbridled nationalism and even to disintegration of the EC. In the short term, financial markets would be shaken. The ERM would come under still greater strain. Interest rates, both short and long term, would diverge and realignments might become inescapable. Those who put their trust in the prospects for Emu would have to reconsider their plans. Countries such as Italy and Spain, for example, which have made convergence on Emu the centre-piece of their macroeconomic policies, would find themselves adrift. Even the almost completed single market would look more doubtful. Everything would have to be reconsidered: management of the relations of other European states with Germany, the EC's monetary regime, the prospects for enlargement and the EC's relations with the rest of the world. Worse, all these would have to be re-examined at a time of slow growth and more than just nascent xenophobia. The Maastricht treaty is flawed. But the alternative would surely be far worse. This is why the referendum matters. It is why the FT intends to devote a special effort to covering it. It is also why this newspaper, in keeping with its traditional support for the integration of Europe, hopes the French will vote yes. But it does so subject to two provisos. First, the EC should not proceed as if nothing had happened, even if the Maastricht treaty were ratified. The EC must be particularly cautious if the treaty receives no more than a small positive affirmation. Subsidiarity must become a living reality, not just a slogan. The convergence criteria will have to be implemented with tact and discretion. No timetable for convergence towards Emu must be allowed to override economic common sense. And, more immediately, if currency adjustments are required, so be it. Second, the downfall of the Maastricht treaty, should that occur, must not be allowed to mark finis to all that Europe has achieved in the postwar era. The loss of this treaty would be a misfortune. To allow it to lead to the collapse of the EC or even to an outbreak of mutual recrimination and disorder would be worse than folly. The French referendum is inescapably important. But rejection does not have to be a disaster.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Video group to develop Dollars 1bn park Blockbuster Entertainment yesterday said it was forming a Blockbuster Park division as part of the group's transformation from a video rental company to a full-scale entertainment conglomerate, writes Richard Tomkins. The division's first project will be the development of the Dollars 1bn Blockbuster Park, a sports and entertainment complex that the group wants to build on a 2,500-acre site near Fort Lauderdale in Florida. If the project goes ahead, one function of the complex will be to serve as a home to two sports teams owned by Mr Wayne Huizenga, Blockbuster's chairman  -the Florida Panthers, an ice hockey team, and the Florida Marlins, a baseball team. At one end of the complex will be a 20,000-seat hockey arena for the Panthers and at the other a 45,000 to 50,000-seat baseball stadium for the Marlins. In between an entertainment village will feature restaurants, shops and a theme park. Broadcast facilities, a film and television production studio, a 15- to 20-screen cinema, virtual reality entertainment, a sports museum, a golf course and a hotel are also planned for the site. Blockbuster already owns 1,800 acres of the site - mainly scrubby marshland straddling the Broward and Dade county lines. However, the project has to overcome environmental objections and win approval from the planning authorities before it can go ahead.</p>

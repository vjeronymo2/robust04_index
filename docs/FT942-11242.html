			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Boost for Bank of Scotland's purchase plan Bank of Scotland yesterday affirmed its interest in buying a building society to improve its deposit base as it disclosed that it had more than doubled annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 268.7m, against Pounds 125.3m. Mr Bruce Pattullo, the governor, said that it was among banks examining the possibility of buying a society. But it was not involved in discussions at the moment, and was 'ambivalent' about the benefits of a purchase. Mr Pattullo said that in contrast to Lloyds' proposed Pounds 1.8bn purchase of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, the bank believed the main advantage would be it could strengthen its balance sheet by increasing deposits. The bank, which a year ago set a target limit of 5 per cent asset growth for the year to February 28 in order to maintain its capital ratios, said that assets had grown by 6 per cent as it expanded its market share of bank lending. Operating profits before provisions for bad and doubtful debts rose 19 per cent to Pounds 580.2m, against Pounds 487.9m. The specific provisions charge fell 22 per cent to Pounds 283.8m, which Mr Pattullo said was 'less than we would have liked'. General provisions for anticipated bad debts which have not been identified were increased by Pounds 30.1m, including a Pounds 20.1m discretionary charge. Mr Pattullo said that this was for reasons of prudence, and 'not in order to smooth profits'. The main upset was at its Bank of Wales subsidiary, which recorded a pre-tax loss of Pounds 4.8m because of problems at its motor finance arm. Mr Pattullo said it had found further bad debts after changing provisioning methods. Margins rose, helped by a Pounds 500m increase to Pounds 5.4bn in its mortgage portfolio, and more high margin personal lending. The bank's liabilities were strengthened by a rise in funds held in customer accounts for the first time in eight years. Non-interest income, an area in which the bank has traditionally been regarded as weak, increased by 18 per cent to Pounds 364.5m. Some Pounds 147m of this came from fees and commissions income from branches, which rose by 52 per cent. The tier 1 ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets remained at 5.8 per cent despite the asset growth, and a 10.5 per cent increase in the dividend to 5.05p, against 4.57p. This figure includes a proposed final dividend of 3.18p. Operating costs rose 8 per cent to Pounds 541m, against Pounds 500.3m, although the ratio of costs to income fell from 50.6 per cent to 48.6 per cent. Staff numbers have fallen 10 per cent from their 1989 peak through natural wastage. Mr Pattullo said that internal generation of capital meant that the bank would now be able 'comfortably' to finance asset growth of up to 10 per cent this year. The bank's ordinary shares closed 5p up at 188p. Lex, Page 20</p>

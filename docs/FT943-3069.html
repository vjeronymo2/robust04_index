			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Gains for Swiss franc Continued uncertainty about the outcome of next month's German national elections yesterday helped the Swiss franc to its strongest level since October 1991, writes Philip Gawith. Investors seeking exposure to core European currencies, but wanting to lighten their D-Mark holdings, drove the franc to a London close of SFr0.83, from SFr0.834 on Tuesday, against the D-Mark. Elsewhere in Europe, though, the D-Mark was generally firmer on declining expectations of another round of rate cuts. Against the escudo and peseta it finished at Es102.2 from Es101.9 and at Pta83.12 from Pta82.92. In spite of firmer than expected retail sales figures, and rumours of central bank intervention, the dollar closed lower at DM1.5374 from DM1.5493 and at Y98.875 from Y99.045. But in New York it picked up to end at DM1.5416 and Y99.20. Sterling finished firmer against the dollar, but down against the D-Mark, with the trade weighted index unchanged at 79.2. Although the Swiss economy is benefiting from good growth and inflation performances, analysts said the main engine behind the recent appreciation was rising political uncertainty in Germany. Markets are now nervous about whether Chancellor Kohl and his alliance partners will win sufficient support in next month's elections to continue governing without having to enter a grand coalition. The D-Mark had recently been bid up following renewed discussion of a multi-tier Europe. But investors, concerned that their exposure to Germany had become overweight, have recently been diversifying into the franc. Some observers believe the Swiss franc is vulnerable to a downside correction, possibly aided by a cut in central bank rates. The central bank has recently been very accommodating in its money market operations, with a three-month money bid rate of 3.93 per cent. Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior international economist at UBS, said this might indicate central bank concern at the impact of exchange rate appreciation on exporters. He said technical charts suggested that if the franc appreciated through SFr0.8230, it might well revisit the 1990 levels of around SFr0.8130. The higher than expected UK retail price index, which rose 2.4 per cent in the year to August, unsettled the short end of the interest rate market, raising fears of a further tightening of monetary policy. The December short sterling contract traded some 48,000 lots to end 14 basis points down at 93.23, and prices fell across the length of the yield curve. Analysts said the figures had undermined, in some quarters, the view that Monday's 50 basis-point rise in interest rates had been a pre-emptive strike against inflation. Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at broker GNI, said there was a 'disturbing bear market psychology' afield, and added that investors were using the futures market to hedge cash positions. Futures prices were reflecting this selling pressure, rather than a market view of likely interest rates. Mr Phillips said the market was looking for another 50 basis-point rise in rates before Christmas, rather than the 100 basis points the December contract is discounting. In its daily operations the Bank of England provided UK money markets with late assistance of Pounds 40m after forecasting a Pounds 200m shortage. It did not operate in the morning or afternoon rounds. Overnight money traded between 4 1/4 and 6 1/4 per cent. Three-month sterling LIBOR was unchanged at 5 13/16 per cent. Currency markets appeared to have taken a more positive view of Monday's monetary tightening. Mr Avinash Persaud, currency strategist at JP Morgan in London, said there was now a prospect of sterling decoupling from the dollar. Earlier in the year, sterling had tracked the dollar rather than the D-Mark, with the market taking the UK policy background - an early pick-up in growth, concerns about inflation and a deteriorating current account - as more similar to the US than Europe. But Monday's rate move, he added, had gone some way to overcoming market scepticism about the authorities' willingness to take the necessary steps to combat inflation. Other factors lending support to the pound were potential D-Mark weakness, ahead of the elections; and relative bond market stability, meaning that there was less incentive to take refuge in the D-Mark. There is little expectation of a shift in German interest rates at today's Bundesbank council meeting. Ms Phyllis Reed, fixed income strategist at BZW, said that while she expected a further cut in rates, the Bank would probably wait for a suitable peg to hang it on - probably in the form of an improved set of money supply figures. The repo rate also looks unlikely to move, following comments from Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, the Bundesbank deputy president. He said the current money supply situation could not justify cutting the repo rate to 4.8 per cent, from 4.85 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> NASA / CLOSE CALL;  </P> <P> BUSH LETS SPACE AGENCY REMAIN IN ORBIT, SCRUBS EXTERNAL REVIEW  </P> <P> The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has quietly survived a crisis  that insiders say could have devastated the agency, destroying morale and  driving out its most talented managers and scientists.  </P> <P> The problem for NASA came when both congressional critics and the staff of the  National Space Council, which is chaired by Vice President Dan Quayle,  privately urged a sweeping investigation of alleged mismanagement at the space  agency.  </P> <P> President Bush last week forcefully rejected the calls. Instead of ordering an  outside investigation of NASA's current problems with the space shuttle, the  Hubble telescope and the proposed orbiting space station, Bush took a far more  modest step: He asked NASA Administrator Richard H. Truly to appoint a panel to  review the agency's long-term goals.  </P> <P> BACKGROUND: Speculation that a major investigation was forthcoming had been fed  by a recent story in the weekly trade newspaper Space News. According to the  article, Bush planned a massive NASA reorganization and a fundamental review of  the nation's space priorities. The article also said that the President blamed  current NASA management -- rather than faulty technology or overambitious goals  -- for the agency's troubles.  </P> <P> The story was broadcast by two television networks, which also reported that  Truly was considering resigning over the apparent vote of no confidence by the  White House.  </P> <P> NASA officials were quickly assured by the White House that the story was  groundless. NASA executives became convinced that the tale originated with the  staff of the National Space Council, which has clashed with senior NASA  managers over who should have primacy in setting Administration space policy.  </P> <P> The space council is an interagency group including Truly, several Cabinet  members, Budget Director Richard G. Darman, White House Chief of Staff John H.  Sununu and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. It is chaired by Quayle  and has a staff of about a dozen professionals ensconced in the Old Executive  Office Building adjacent to the White House.  </P> <P> "That's the only group to benefit; they were the perpetrator of a lot of this,"  said a senior NASA official, who insisted on anonymity. "They're searching  desperately for a role."  </P> <P> That role could have been dramatically enhanced had the White House created --  under the aegis of the space council -- a new high-level panel to investigate  all aspects of current and future NASA operations.  </P> <P> "Bush realized that NASA couldn't stand another investigation" following the  massive shake-up of the agency after the Challenger disaster, the senior NASA  official said. "It would end the agency."  </P> <P> ROLE DENIED: A space council official, who asked not to be named, insisted that  the trade newspaper story had not originated there and that the council staff  was not aiming to "take over" NASA. Despite disagreements with agency managers  over a number of space programs, the official said, the space council supports  the overall management of NASA.  </P> <P> Quayle himself met with Truly last week and declared afterward that the  Administration has "complete confidence" in the NASA administrator and  dismissed rampant speculation that the White House would launch a major probe  of the space agency.  </P> <P> "There is no White House investigation of NASA, nor will there be one. We've  got a challenge to move this space program forward, which we will," the vice  president said.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Quayle announced that veteran aerospace executive Norman R.  Augustine, former head of Martin Marietta Corp., had been selected to head an  independent committee that will review the space agency and report to Truly.  </P> <P> PROBLEMS MOUNT: Meanwhile, NASA's problems continued to mount -- a hydrogen  leak delaying the planned flight of the Atlantis space shuttle was disclosed  Wednesday -- and NASA critics were openly skeptical of the agency's planned  internal review.  </P> <P> "The real question now is, is the organization performing up to standards that  could and should be expected? I feel it's not," said John Logsdon, director of  the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University here. "They should  be looking at the whole organization, its structure and way of doing business  and whether they are appropriate for the missions proposed for the next decade  and beyond."  </P></p>

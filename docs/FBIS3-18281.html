As head of the Police Intelligence Service, PET,  the country's justice minister holds a powerful tool in his  hands. The secret police have the right to watch, monitor, and  register the citizen's slightest movements to a degree unmatched  by any other state institution. The parameters for the  service's work are described in a highly confidential set of  rules dating from 1953 and now ripe for retirement, but it is  the minister who decides on the details of which political  groups the service is to spend its time on.    [POLITIKEN] It is said that a minister for justice can  easily  misuse the Police Intelligence Service if he is determined to do  so. For example, he can use the PET to spy on his or the  government's political opponents. Is this true?    [Olsen] I have never attempted to do so, nor would I ever  dream of doing so. If one wants to do away with one's  opponents, then there are far better ways of going about it. Is  it possible? I do not think the present head of the PET would  allow it. Nor do I think that the heads of department in the  Justice Ministry or the commissioner of police would allow it.  If I insisted on trying to persuade them, then the right thing  for them to do would be to go to the Prime Minister and report  me.    [POLITIKEN] What do you use the PET for?    [Olsen] I use the PET to ensure that democracy is not so  tolerant that it lets power slip into the hands of the  intolerant. It is the PET's job to watch external and internal  enemies. It is the latter who are the most interesting,  following the shift in the international situation.    [POLITIKEN] Of what benefit is the PET to the public?    [Olsen] The benefit is that democracy is protected. There is  a borderline between tolerance and naivete that must not be  crossed. There are at the moment right-wing groups that were  left-wing groups, as we saw in Norrebro after the EC vote on 18  May last year. We have to monitor these extreme groups. They  have the right to express themselves as they wish, but the  moment more militant action takes place, we have to keep an eye  on them. In order to ensure that things remain reasonably  peaceful, we have to nip this type of action in the bud.  <H5>  Monitoring the PET </H5>   [POLITIKEN] As justice minister you have ultimate  responsibility for the PET. You are, in fact, the only one  outside the service who has access to details of the PET's work.  What do you do in order to ensure that you know enough about  the activities of the PET? What do you do to keep control of  the PET?    [Olsen] You cannot have a service like this without there  being a considerable degree of self-control, that is,  self-control by the employees. I cannot run around checking on  the PET. I receive 200 letters a day, I give interviews to the  press, I attend meetings and so forth. I have a great many  things to do.    [POLITIKEN] Which is tantamount to saying that the  monitoring  of the PET is, to a great extent, carried out by the PET itself?    [Olsen] Yes, that is true. The same thing applies everywhere  in the public administration. As a minister, you cannot keep an  eye on everything. But if anything happens that should not  happen, then you have to go into it and do something about it.    [POLITIKEN] But that implies that you hear about it.    [Olsen] And that is why we have a fairly free press.    [POLITIKEN] So it is up to the press to check on the PET?    [Olsen] It is up to the press and the employees within the  PET. Obviously the PET could not live with a reputation like the  KGB's. There must be support for and confidence in the methods  used by the PET, and if an employee oversteps the rules, that is  grounds for dismissal.    [POLITIKEN] Is the self-control so careful that you dare  place your head on the block and say that the intelligence  service has no chance of taking you for a ride?    [Olsen] I shall never be happy at the thought of laying my  head on any block. Not even a journalist's.  <H5>  The Threat Comes From the Forces of the Right </H5>   [POLITIKEN] How can the PET work according to a set of rules  that is 41 years old and that came into being when the Cold War  was at its coldest. The world and the threat assessment picture  have changed a good deal since then, after all.    [Olsen] That is why we are also considering changing the  rules, so that we spend more time watching internal enemies than  we do external ones.    [POLITIKEN] Where do the threats against the Danish state  come from today?    [Olsen] You have organized forces of the extreme right, you  see nazism spreading outside our borders. At the moment we are  experiencing pressure from Germany, which regards us as being so  open and democratic that we may become a haven for German Nazi  and right-wing forces. They can direct operations from here.  We see, too, that a number of Danish Nazis have quite good  links with the German forces of the right. Those are things we  have to keep an eye on.    [POLITIKEN] Would it be fair to say that, whereas 20 to 30  years ago it was the left wing that was fanatical, it is now the  right wing?    [Olsen] I have to admit that at the moment I am more afraid  of the right wing than I am of the left.  <H5>  Necessary Secrets </H5>   [POLITIKEN] Why does the PET's operating mandate have to  remain a secret?    [Olsen] The people who come under the scrutiny of the PET  must not be aware of it.    [POLITIKEN] When the mandate is secret, the inevitable  impression is that it authorizes the PET to do things that are  just inside or even in breach of the rules and laws that  otherwise apply to police work.    [Olsen] That is not the way it is. It is simply a question  of those people whom the PET "looks after" not needing to know  too much.    [POLITIKEN] Is there actually anything in the operating  mandate stating what people and which groups the PET is to  monitor?    [Olsen] So far as I remember there is nothing about that.  But apart from that I cannot say what is written in the  mandate. If I could, there would be no reason to keep it secret.    [POLITIKEN] When a 41-year-old operating mandate has been in  use for so many years, it must be worded very generally. So it  must be up to the justice minister at any given time to flesh  out the bones -- to direct the PET's current work. How have you  altered the course of the PET?    [Olsen] It is true that the minister can flesh out the bones  with some general measures. But he is obliged to leave a good  deal to the experts in policing matters. My message to the PET  at the beginning of my career as justice minister was about the  intelligence service needing to pay more attention to the  enemies from within.    [POLITIKEN] Does it make any difference to the PET whether  there is a conservative or a social democratic justice minister?    [Olsen] I do not honestly think so.    [POLITIKEN] Is that because the PET is first and foremost an  operation run by civil servants?    [Olsen] No, it is because it is a question of defending  democracy, and the conservatives want to do that just as much as  we do.    [POLITIKEN] In common with the parliamentary control  committee and the PET chief Birgitte Stampe, you are in favor of  greater openness concerning the PET. What does "greater  openness" mean?    [Olsen] It does not mean revealing secrets, but clearing up  misunderstandings. I think, for example, that we can certainly  talk about the current threat assessment picture. I think we  can also certainly talk about the budget for the PET. Why keep  it a secret, when the number of employees can be seen in the  Annual Police Report? In other words: considerably more  openness than we have today.    [POLITIKEN] Do you think the PET deserves to be taken  seriously by the public so long as everything to do with the  service is kept secret?    [Olsen] I believe that the public likes the secrecy. While  we are faced with these revolutionary groups, these people who  refuse to acknowledge democratic rules of play, then we need to  keep an eye on them. Confronted by highly organized crime, we  need to do something about it. Often it takes place unobserved.  But clearly it must happen according to proper rules of play.  As far as the PET is concerned, we have to leave things to it,  but at the end of the day I am the one who decides what is to be  done and what may be made public.  <H5>  PET Given a Long Lead </H5>   [POLITIKEN] One of the most serious attacks against state  security -- against democracy -- took place after the EC  referendum 18 May last year. On that occasion the Copenhagen  police were caught unawares, because the PET had not foreseen  the riots in Norrebro. Why have you not asked for an  investigation into the role of the PET in this case, in the same  way as the role of the Copenhagen Police Force is being  investigated by the attorney general?    [Olsen] Yes, but the Attorney General's investigation also  includes the work of the PET. I have also wondered myself why  it was that the PET was unable to foresee that catastrophic  situation which developed during the evening and night. The PET  ought to know about this sort of thing beforehand. On the other  hand, the PET cannot have a spy on every corner. We would be a  police state. So there will conceivably be some things that the  PET does not know. I am afraid that if we have too much  surveillance, we will also see an escalation. You have to  restrict yourself when it comes to things like telephone  bugging. Denmark must not become a society of eavesdroppers.  But it goes without saying that the PET made a mistake in not  foreseeing the disturbances in Norrebro. It is now the job of  the attorney general to assess how serious a mistake it was.  When we have heard from him, then it will be up to me as  justice minister to consider whether changes are necessary in  the PET's working methods.    [POLITIKEN] How can the PET be justified in having up to  12,000 people registered on suspicion of antistate activity when  virtually nobody is ever accused and brought to trial?    [Olsen] Well, if they were all to be accused and tried, then  something would be wrong. In surveillance terms, you always  have to monitor far more people than you can bring charges  against.    [POLITIKEN] Your own control body -- the Wamberg Committee  with Chief Administrative Officer Bodil Panild, Senior Archivist  Hans Christian Bjerg, Solicitor Niels Fisch-Thomsen, and  Publisher Kurt Fromberg -- has to approve all registrations of  Danish citizens. But what about the 200,000 or so foreign  nationals permanently resident in Denmark? Is there nobody to  check any registrations made of them?    [Olsen] I have not thought about that question, and so I  cannot answer it.    [POLITIKEN] Where is the line drawn for how much  run-of-the-mill crime the PET can allow itself to close its eyes  to in the attempt to uncover something bigger and more serious  -- for example, a Dane collaborating with the intelligence  service of an Eastern country or a terrorist organization in the  Middle East?    [Olsen] That rests entirely on police assessment. But it is  my view that the PET should have a fairly long leash.    [POLITIKEN] In spite of what you have said in this  interview,  as an ordinary person one gets the impression that nobody -- not  even the changing justice ministers -- ever call the PET to  account for what the intelligence service does. Is it right  that, in a democratic society, the PET should have such free  rein?    [Olsen] The fact is that it is not the justice minister who  calls the PET to order. If anything goes wrong in the PET, it  is the justice minister's responsibility. That is the way it is.</p>

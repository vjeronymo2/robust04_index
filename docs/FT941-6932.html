			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Arts: Danger is the spur at the Kirov Opera - Max Loppert talks to Valery Gergiev, whose passionate energy is keeping the operatic tradition of St Petersburg alive Valery Gergiev, chief conductor and artistic administrator of the Kirov Opera of St Petersburg, sits in one of the ornately stuccoed side-offices of the Maryinsky Theatre, cradling a can of beer and reflecting on the urgency of his mission. It is late; he has already conducted a Rimsky-Korsakov opera and the dress rehearsal of an about-to-open new Rimsky-Korsakov production, let alone all the organisational confabs that seem to fill his every minute in between. But plainly Gergiev's energy-supply equals his passion for the task of keeping the Kirov Opera alive and kicking. Of the difficulty of that task he is in no doubt. 'This is a terrible time for the country. Many parts of this city are in a very bad state. We have to show that there is at least one reason for people to have pride in St Petersburg.' Few of the world's leading opera companies convey a greater sense of do-or-die importance in their commitment, or manage to forge ahead in conditions apparently so comprehensively unfavourable to progress. In the week of the Kirov's Rimsky-Korsakov in the 20th Century Festival the rouble dropped from 1,450 to 1,600 to the dollar. This was, of course, not an isolated fall. Remember the Chinese curse - 'may you live in interesting times'? In this sense these are indeed interesting times for the country, most of whose cultural institutions are engaged in the simple attempt at survival. At the Kirov Opera, the difference is that living dangerously has proved a spur, not a bar, to artistic vitality. State support, now down to about 20 per cent of company budget, pays only for salaries - and, Gergiev says, 'they are low, far too low'. Box-office revenue is not a serious consideration: although foreigners pay dollar prices for tickets, up to Dollars 45 for best seats, top level for locals is only 5,000 roubles. This reflects Gergiev's concern to keep in touch with his 'real' public: 'We are not going to punish the people of Russia who love opera. They already have many things unavailable, even food, and are living from day to day.' Money for productions must be found from other sources. The main one is the contract Gergiev and the Kirov Opera have fixed with Philips, which has led to a superb stream of Russian discs. The Philips connection is crucial, and highly demanding. During the festival live concert recordings and non-live operatic ones were taking up every spare second of Gergiev's time. Foreign tours - never with easy-sell Boris and Onegin schedules but always with material genuinely reflecting the company's current preoccupations - have become a regular feature. The Friends of the Kirov, a British organisation (president: Placido Domingo, who sang a Kirov Otello last year) that has sprung up alongside Gergiev's London link with the Royal Philharmonic, is already enthusiastically spreading the word about the company; other friends' groups are planned in other cities. Meanwhile, the Kirov Opera operates on a knife-edge. The company has no press officer and very little in the way of permanently attached artistic direction; Gergiev's right-hand man also plays oboe in the orchestra and teaches at the Conservatory. As a leading British opera-house administrator visiting the festival wryly put it, 'This certainly all gives one pause about how many people you actually need to run an opera house]'. But so skeletal an administrative complement does not lend itself to quick decision-making: according to a Western opera-house boss trying to co-ordinate the future acquisition of one of the Kirov's Rimsky-Korsakov productions, hanging around for meetings whose conclusions must then be re-confirmed with other outposts of the Maryinsky bureaucracy, is a draining one: 'What this company needs is just one good business manager]'. What it does have, instead, is the extraordinary Gergiev, a 'one-man powerhouse who can make anything sound possible' according to a recent Opera profile. He came into the job five-and-a-half years ago, at the age of 35. New freedoms were opening up; 'never before', he says, 'had we felt power like that - suddenly we felt strong, all 400 or 500 artists'. Not a native Petersburger - he was born in Moscow and grew up in the Caucasus - he came to the city as a student; and its glorious musical tradition, as exemplified by the Philharmonic Orchestra, the Conservatory and the Maryinsky, have inspired his own musical gifts. The preservation of that tradition, at least the operatic part, is now the torch he carries. But Gergiev's is no hidebound version of preservation: continual renewal and reclamation (such as the restoration in Tchaikovsky's Iolanta and Rimsky-Korsakov's Kitezh of all textual references to Christianity long censored in the Soviet era) are its characterising features. He has invited in production talent from the West - Graham Vick, David Freeman, Tim Hopkins, Brigitte Fassbaender - while resisting the notion that fashionably interventionist Western staging styles should be sought for everything. A handful of his top singers have moved westwards; more numerous are the ones such as Galina Gorchakova and Olga Borodina, blossoming world stars who keep homes in the city and their Kirov links alive by, inter alia, trying out new roles under Gergiev's care. The bait of the Philips Kirov recordings is evidently a succulent one. Above all, his artistic policy is to re-examine the St Petersburg inheritance and spark vital new connections. The Prokofiev, Mussorgsky and Rimsky festivals have all been undertaken in this light; next year's large-scale survey of the 'Russian' Stravinsky - a Petersburg composer whose towering stature is still not conclusively established in Russia - will continue the process. New operas are being commissioned. And so the work goes on: round the clock, it appears. Can it all last? Gergiev wisely evades all future speculation, preferring to close our midnight conversation with a ruefully humorous observation: 'If everyone in Russia could work as hard as we have done here in the last five years, there would be no economic problems]'.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / US in 'cash for clunkers' pollution plan THE US plans to introduce an innovative system to allow industrial polluters to meet environmental standards not by reducing their own emissions, but by buying up and scrapping heavily polluting old cars. Companies which bought such cars would be able to offset the amount of pollution savings against the requirements imposed on them to reduce their own emissions. The proposed system, known to the administration as 'mobile/stationary emission source trading' and to the layman as 'cash for clunkers,' provides a way of introducing market forces into efforts to improve the environment, instead of imposing detailed 'command-and-control' regulations. This kind of market-based environmental protection has been advocated by the OECD. The Environmental Protection Agency is to set up a scale of emission credits for different models of car, based on their level of pollution and likely future lifespan. Mr Richard Morgenstern, an administrator at the agency, said cars built before 1980represented only 38 per cent of the cars on the road in the US but produced 86 per cent of vehicle carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. 'The dirtiest 6 per cent of cars on the road emit 50 per cent of the hydrocarbons.' The administration withheld a proposal to couple this measure with a plan to weaken fuel efficiency standards for cars using reformulated petrol, which produces lower levels of hydrocarbons. Carmakers are obliged to meet an average fuel efficiency standard of 27.5 miles per US gallon.</p>

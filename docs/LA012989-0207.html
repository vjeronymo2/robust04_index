			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OFFICER NEARLY RUN DOWN; DRIVER HELD  </P> <P> A Santa Ana man was arrested after trying to run down a Westminster motorcycle  patrolman during a chase, authorities said Saturday.  </P> <P> Westminster Police Sgt. Larry Russell said the incident began around 8:45 p.m.  Friday when a car driven by Jose Manuel Najarra Herrera, 21, was spotted  speeding in the area of Bushard Street and McFadden Avenue.  </P> <P> Russell said that Herrera failed to stop for police and that a chase began,  covering a 4-mile area through commercial and residential areas in Westminster  and Garden Grove.  </P> <P> Herrera ran at least four stop signs and traffic lights before he entered a  residential area in Garden Grove, Russell said.  </P> <P> "At that point, the suspect turned his car around and tried to flee again,  aiming his car at a police motorcycle," he said. The patrolman hopped off his  motorcycle before Herrera's car slammed into it, police said.  </P> <P> The patrolman fired two shots at the suspect's car. Both hit the car, but  Herrera was not wounded, Russell said.  </P> <P> Herrera was stopped two blocks away and arrested. He was arrested on suspicion  of assault with a deadly weapon, evading arrest and driving under the influence  of alcohol. He was treated and released for minor injuries at Humana Hospital  in Westminster and later taken to Orange County Jail, where bail was set at  $25,000.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The deputy commander general of the NPFL [National  Patriotic Front of Liberia] 2d Brigade, General Patrick Walker,  says the Liberia Peace Council [LPC] is planning an attack on  NPFL positions in Grand Bassa County. Speaking to reporters  recently, Gen. Walker said more than 60 LPC fighters were  discovered in the Firestone area planning to attack NPFL  positions in Harbel District in Grand Bassa. He said AFL [Armed  Forces of Liberia] personnel at Firestone are masterminding the  planned attack. General Walker is, meanwhile, urging civilians  in the area not to panic as the situation is under control. At  the same time, the Liberia Peace Council has been accused of  killing relief personnel in southeast Liberia. The  International Action Against Hunger based in Monrovia says the  LPC killed two MSF [Medecins sans Frontieres] personnel recently  in the southeast. It says the killing of the relief personnel  by the LPC poses danger to relief organizations operating in the  area. A spokesman for the group says the killing of the relief  personnel has tampered with delivery of humanitarian assistance  to thousands of people in that region.</p>

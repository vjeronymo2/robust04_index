			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Observer: UNEPotism Reverting to the subject of the peculiar ways of UN agencies, could the United Nations Environment Programme not have looked a little further before awarding its annual Dollars 200,000 environment prize to Mostafa Tolba, UNEP's executive director from 1976 until his retirement last year? Tolba's successor, Canadian Elizabeth Dowdeswell, apparently expressed reservations about the choice of this year's prize-winner. However, she was unable to persuade the selection committee, nominated during Tolba's reign, to reverse its decision. A UNEP press release said Tolba had been honoured for going 'far beyond the call of duty in his commitment, dedication and contributions to the environment'. Tolba does have some feathers in his cap - notably the Montreal Protocol for the protection of the ozone layer. Back in his native Cairo, Tolba expressed neither surprise nor embarrassment at UNEP's decision to top up his pension with such a generous award. He plans to use the money to establish a National Centre for Environment and Development in Egypt. No prizes for guessing who is likely to be president.</p>

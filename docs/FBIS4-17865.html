			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 27 TASS -- Chairman of the North  Atlantic Assembly of the NATO Parliament, Loic Bouvard, said at  a meeting with the Chairman of the Russian Federation [title as  received], Vladimir Shumeyko, on Wednesday that lasting peace in  Europe is impossible without Russia.    Bouvard pointed out that during his visit to Russia and  meetings with Russian lawmakers he realised that the attitude of  Russian parliamentarians to the Partnership for Peace Programme  was not unequivocal. In his opinion, this can be accounted for  by internal, rather than external political reasons. Bouvard  pointed out that he was prepared to explain the situation in the  NATO Parliament.    The speaker of the Federation Council believes that the  attitude to this problem in Russia and, in particular,  statements made by politicians depend on the availability of  information. Shumeyko suggested that the lack of information  about developments in Yugoslavia affected the attitude of the  Russian people. Shumeyko pointed out that many people find the  problem of joining the NATO programme difficult because only  yesterday, NATO was Russia's adversary. "However, this problem  is in the process of settlement," Shumeyko said.</p>

His comment follows last night's announcement by  the Freedom Alliance that it won't make any more concessions in  negotiations with the ANC [African National Congress] and the  government. Mr. Meyer told television news that the alliance  had communicated to him today to facilitate further discussions,  but its inflexibility might make a settlement impossible.    [Begin Meyer recording] It's a question of how do you  negotiate. Do you negotiate to ensure a settlement at the end  which provides a win-win situation, or do you want a win-lose  situation? I'm afraid that is not attainable under these  circumstances, and in the end I believe what we need to get  clarity on from the Freedom Alliance is whether they are, in  fact, wanting a solution that could lead to an inclusive  settlement.

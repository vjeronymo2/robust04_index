			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NO SELLOUT IN U.S.-JAPANESE F-16 DEAL, CARLUCCI ASSERTS  </P> <P> Former Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci told a congressional panel today  that the Pentagon did not sell out U.S. economic interests in agreeing to  transfer to Japan technology for building an advanced version of the F-16  fighter.  </P> <P> "It is my judgment that the FSX represents a good deal for Japan, a good deal  for the United States and an excellent deal for the U.S.-Japan security and  industrial relationship," Carlucci told a Senate Armed Services subcommittee.  </P> <P> He asserted that "in the end, much of the criticism of the FSX deal reflects an  irrational fear of Japan's technological prowess."  </P> <P> Under the deal, St. Louis-based General Dynamics would join forces with Japan's  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to co-develop and co-produce a next-generation  fighter, called the FSX, for deployment by Japan in the late 1990s.  </P> <P> Proponents argue that the agreement represents the best deal the United States  could negotiate in the face of Japanese opposition to buying F-16s directly  from the United States. They say the deal will serve to promote beneficial  technology transfer in both directions while generating income and jobs for  U.S. industry.  </P> <P> Critics, however, contend that the arrangement amounts to a giveaway of  advanced technology that Japan may use to help propel its civilian aircraft  industry into head-to-head competition with the United States in the world  market.  </P> <P> In the face of congressional criticism, the Bush Administration has been  conducting an interagency review of the FSX deal before sending the agreement  to Capitol Hill.  </P></p>

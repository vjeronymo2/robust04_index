			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / UK Company News: A branch less fruitful than expected - Bids are invited for Meyna, PPI's Turkish offshoot CREDITORS of Polly Peck International should say goodbye to any lingering hope of significant cash remittances from Meyna, the company's Turkish fruit and packaging subsidiary. Figures contained in a confidential 'information memorandum' sent to prospective buyers, reveal a company currently turning over barely a fifth of the sales reported in PPI's consolidated accounts before the group went into administration in October 1990 owing banks and other creditors Pounds 1.13bn. Whatever may have been the impression in the City of Meyna's contribution to PPI's reported profits of Pounds 107m from its near and Middle East operations - out of a group total of Pounds 161m - Meyna would now appear to be a medium-sized business, with negligible exports, and about a 5 per cent share of a highly competitive local market. The decision to invite bids ends one of the more frustrating chapters in a 27-month administration to recover the Turkish assets of the UK-based fruit and electronics group. According to Coopers &amp; Lybrand, one of the two UK accountancy firms in charge of the administration, Meyna is being sold on the basis of the company's own unaudited management and tax accounts - figures which have not been 'independently verified,' the memorandum says. 'We're confident the numbers on which the sale is being made give a fair picture of the group,' said Mr Stuart Smith, the Coopers partner in charge of disposal of the Turkish companies, who said the administrators hoped to be in a position to conclude the sale in a few weeks. As early as May 1991, the administrators warned that Meyna's trading performance as reported in Polly Peck's accounts 'may be significantly overstated.' However, it is unlikely that many of PPI's 23,000 creditors envisaged quite the magnitude of the discrepancy. Meyna incurred net losses - after general and administrative expenses - in 1990, 1991, and the nine months to September 1992. In contrast, the administrators had established from records at Polly Peck's London headquarters that Meyna had reported revenues of TL578bn (Pounds 140m) and trading profits of TL195bn for the first six months of 1990. The local management accounts reveal a much more modest performance. For the whole of 1990 Meyna's sales totalled TL251bn for a gross profit of just TL13bn. Equally modest, the group's assets were valued at TL129bn (Pounds 31m). This is hard to match with Turkish Treasury figures which show Meyna as the second largest UK capital investment - Vestel, PPI's Istanbul electronics subsidiary, being the largest. Turkish fruit traders, however, were always clear about the size of Meyna. 'If Meyna stopped producing tomorrow it would have absolutely no effect on the market here,' said the owner of one of largest fruit companies. 'I think they'll get a very rude shock when they try to sell the group,' said another competitor. Bids are invited for Meyna, the group's fresh fruit arm, Meysin, a fruit concentrate business, and Unipac, a small corrugated box factory at Adana, the only subsidiary currently reporting profits. Mr Fahri Gorgulu, the company's chief executive and former head of the Turkish police, confirmed that Meysan, a sunflower oil refiner, Kaynak, a wholesaler, and Niksar, PPI's bottled water plant, had been sold to Mr Sudi Ozkan, a local casino owner. Because of the share structure and inter-company balances, only part of the proceeds have been remitted to PPI - the balance was reinvested in the Meyna group. However, the deal is not expected to generate a large sum. Meysan has little in the way of assets, while Kaynak has ceased operations in Ankara, Adana and Izmir. 'What we have left are the Meysan sites at Adana and Mersin and the three other packing houses. It's a conventional marketing and auctioning operation,' said Mr Smith. The administrators are talking to 'a number of interested parties'. Their preference is to sell the whole operation, but they will consider the sale of individual units. However, their efforts to sell could be hampered by current market conditions. The fruit sector is currently awash with excess capacity, following last year's sale of two state-owned fruit juice companies - Meysu and Guneysu. Traders say there may be interest from a business downstream, but here the government's planned share offering in Sek, its dairy corporation, could dampen enthusiasm. Meyna may have some of the most modern facilities in Turkey, but there is unlikely to be much additional value put on Meyna's brand names - Fresh, its fruit juice, being its best known. Moreover, the properties, while close to the citrus groves, are far from the apple, peach, apricot and cherry regions, an important consideration when fruit businesses are trying to diversify product lines to maximise factory utility rates. Given that the company is suffering losses, one London analyst suggested it was doubtful any buyer would pay more than net asset value and 'in fact more likely a discount to net asset value.' Meyna's net asset value was put at TL194bn in 1991. Certainly, there has been an impact on the balance sheet. Already, banks are restricting credit lines, while suppliers demand cash payment. As a result, the group is now working on a contract basis, no longer buying fruit on its own account. Meyna has been forced to sell one of its five packing houses and another was closed. The Unipac cardboard box facility at Adana is working at about 50 per cent capacity. Since the administration, the fresh produce operation has withdrawn from trading in pulses, raisins and nuts. The administrators say they are marketing the companies on the basis of their present trading performance. Anything else would be 'entering the area of the unknown'. However, a buyer may find it difficult to make an assessment of the group's potential, without figures for the period prior to the administration, which Meyna's management has declined to provide.</p>

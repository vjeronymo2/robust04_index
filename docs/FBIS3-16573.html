Opposition and Majority Differ on  Republic's Fundamental Law"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Zenon Poznyak, leader of the  parliamentary opposition Belarus National Front, commenting in  an exclusive interview to your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent  on the adoption of the Constitution, stated: "This Constitution  has been passed only to introduce a presidential system designed  for one specific person, Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich; and  for one political action, presidential elections. Other than  this, the Constitution is not going to work in a normal way;  neither will the presidential system of government, because it  does not provide for balanced relations between local  authorities and the Supreme Soviet, between the president and  the Supreme Soviet, between the executive and judicial powers.  The Constitution has been designed to suit a totalitarian  regime and the specific figure of Kebich, who actually has the  Supreme Soviet in his hands now. It is designed to give Kebich  absolute power in a legitimate way. Should another president  come along, he would not be able to do anything in this  unbalanced system, and would be drawn into conflict with the  Supreme Soviet and local authorities.    Members of the parliamentary majority naturally see the  adoption of the Constitution quite differently. Nikolay  Skorigin, adviser to the prime minister and coordinator of the  most influential "Belarus" parliamentary group, referred in an  interview for your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent to the  above accusations: "This is simply ridiculous. How could the  Constitution have been designed over two and a half years for  one person? All the more so because no one can be dead sure of  who is going to be elected first president of the Republic of  Belarus."    "From the legal point of view, the passing of the  Constitution is a foundation for the state's entire legal base,  and from the political point of view, it is a legal guarantee of  ensuring stability in the state. We have managed to cross the  Rubicon from the old Constitution, which was a brake on creating  a rule-of-law state, to the new Constitution without a single  drop of blood having been shed. This is a great victory for  what seems to be a virtually inefficient parliament." This is  the opinion of Dmitriy Bulakhov, chairman of the parliamentary  commission on legislation.

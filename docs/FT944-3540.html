			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Council to study new road network The possibility of improving links between the motorway network, West Cumbria and Barrow-in-Furness is to be further investigated by Cumbria County Council, in spite of environmental difficulties and an estimated Pounds 500m cost for the route enhancement under consideration. The county's economy and environment committee yesterday rejected the idea of a new Pounds 800m route crossing Morecambe Bay and the Solway Firth. But it decided to engage consultants to look further at a different option, comprising crossings of the Kent, Leven and Duddon estuaries in south Cumbria and a dual carriageway from the M6 in Lancashire to Workington.</p>

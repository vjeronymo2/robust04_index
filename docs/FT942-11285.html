			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Management: Cross-border victory, national casualty How time flies. Four years ago a government affairs executive from a big American multinational was heard complaining about a nagging problem. How could the company tell governments, without causing a storm, that the changing technology and economics of its industry were undermining its ability - and that of many competitors - to remain a 'good corporate citizen'? To be specific, how could it convince seemingly deaf officials that slower market growth, plus the scope for greater cross-border economies of scale within Europe and across the globe, would soon make it impossible for many multinationals to maintain a balance of activities between countries? Put bluntly, they would soon need to develop products in only one or two European countries, and to make them in just a handful. There would have to be some painful relocations. Today even the deafest government official is all too aware of the problem. The arrival of the single European market has combined with recession and greater global competition to force company after company to reconfigure its network of activities. For understandable but misguided reasons, the relocation of existing factory work tends to grab more headlines than the reconfiguration of higher value-added activities - such as research, design and engineering - on which future businesses depend. In the last fortnight there have been several such moves. One of the most widely publicised was LIG's transfer of condom manufacture from Britain to Italy and Spain. Moulinex also announced the shift of kettle-making from the UK to its native France. But the two most significant decisions came from Texas Instruments, the US electronics group, and from Ford. As part of a 're-engineering' of its operations which involves creating a small number of European 'business centres', TI is to shut its long-established plant near London. It also plans to transfer two of its four highest-technology development teams in the UK to Germany and France. A smaller number of engineers will move in the reverse direction to join one of the other UK teams. Even more sweeping is Ford's merger of its North American and European vehicle operations, which have always worked separately. Europe will become the global product development and management centre for small and medium-sized cars, while America takes the rest. In one sense the TI and Ford changes are the latest examples of a now standard 1990s phenomenon: the migration of multinationals away from geographic structures towards global ones. Because of the circumstances of its industry and its corporate history, Ford is a generation ahead of TI and many other companies in this process; it is moving from regional to global, while they shift from national to regional. But in other ways, the moves by TI and Ford challenge conventional wisdom about how multinationals should operate. Take TI first. Other large US multinationals, such as 3M and Hewlett-Packard, have been able to abandon country-based structures without affecting the scope and depth of their operations in major European nations. Units in France, Germany, Italy, the UK and elsewhere have been given regional or global responsibility for particular businesses and product lines. Their manufacturing and product development have been reinforced, not reduced. Sadly, 3M and HP are in the minority. TI's problem, and that of most other US and European companies, is that their range of activities in Europe is not broad enough, or breakable into sufficiently small units, to be spread evenly across the region. Nor has TI been growing fast enough to emulate 3M and HP. But this does not explain its need to move two teams of engineers out of the UK. The one being moved to Germany was too small to stand alone. But this is not true of the other. TI says it decided that the British team, which works on digital signal processing for use in multimedia and information highways, should be brought together to create 'synergy' with a similar group in France. Nice was the best location, even though it is further than southern England from TI's main European customers. But why co-locate the groups at all? Why, in these electronic days, could they not be kept in different locations, able to communicate with each other at will? Given all the complexities of developing new products, co-location is always ideal. But in order to tap skills around the world and to be responsive to market differences, networks of far-flung specialists often have to work together. Such networks are supposed to be one of the hallmarks of the modern multinational. Which brings us to Ford. Unlike TI, it is retaining, at least for now, its existing European design, development and engineering centres - in Germany and Britain. The financial and political costs of merging them would be high. But it has admitted in the past that it suffers a cost penalty from having two centres in the same region. Its new global managers will be hunting hard for productivity increases in engineering. Ford could also decide in a few years' time to shift responsibility for some small cars to Mazda, its Japanese affiliate - a step which was mooted a few years ago. So, although Ford has always tried harder than most to be a good European corporate citizen, it may yet have to bring itself to concentrate most of its engineering in either Germany or Britain. Other companies - and countries - will be watching with more than a modicum of self-interest its struggle to organise more productively across borders without creating national casualties.</p>

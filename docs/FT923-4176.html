			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Survey of Mobile Communications (9): Dragons are still hungry - Asia ASIA'S appetite for mobile communications verges on the insatiable. According to a recent study by the London-based telecommunications consultancy, CIT Research, the 1991 market for mobile services and equipment in just eight countries in the Asia Pacific region was worth around Dollars 9bn. By 2001, the company forecasts that the value of the same business in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand will grow to around Dollars 28bn, with some countries in this group clocking up annual mobile market growth rates in three figures. The reasons for such phenomenal expansion differ from location to location. Some countries in the region have buoyant economies and are growing at between 5 and 10 per cent annually. Others possess tremendous growth potential. In both cases, demand for telecommunications service and equipment of all kinds is building rapidly and, as is generally acknowledged, mobile technology is at the cutting edge of the global telecommunications industry. Competition is an important factor in some markets, particularly in Hong Kong, where there are four different nominated cellular operators, and Japan, where around 40 paging operators compete for customers with the incumbent carrier Nippon Telegraph and Telephone. However, competition is not a unique spur to expansion. As CIT points out, the South Korean paging market, which probably is the fastest growing in the world, is operated as a monopoly. A third explanation for Asia's enthusiasm for mobile communications is that, for the most part, local operators do not have huge investments in wireline networks which need to be amortised over a period of years. They can, instead, exploit new mobile radio technology to increase subscriber access to modern telecommunications facilities. A cellular service jointly launched by the Ho Chi Minh Post and Telecommunications Administration and Singapore Telecom International in Vietnam is a case in point. 'The pace of economic activity in Vietnam has stepped up to the extent that the telephone infrastructure is inadequate to meet the demand from business,' says Mr Philip Low, Singapore Telecom's marketing manager for the project. 'We decided to fill the vacuum by providing mobile telephone services for businessmen who are constantly on the move here.' Analogue cellular telephone systems are spearheading the region's mobile voice revolution. Pyramid Research of the US calculates that developing countries in Asia will increase their cellular subscriber populations from a mere 615,000 in 1990 to 3.3m in 1993. But this is small beer compared to the industrialised nations in the region. Japan's current 1.25m cellular users are forecast to increase to anywhere between 9m and 14m by the early years of the next decade. Although systems of US origin have tended to dominate Asia's analogue cellular markets, the switch to digital has created an important opening for Europe's GSM. This opportunity has come about in part because GSM is commercially the most mature digital cellular system in the world today. Meanwhile, the existence of a number of different and incompatible digital and analogue follow-on systems in the US has not been particularly helpful to the export prospects of that country's mobile industry. So far, GSM has been selected for implementation in Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Singapore. Trial systems have been supplied to China, the Philippines and Taiwan, and India recently announced its aim of granting GSM concessions for the cities of Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi and Madras. Interest in the European system has also been voiced by Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. But GSM will not have the field to itself. A number of local operators have decided to wait for a North American digital cellular solution, and Japan is now starting to promote its own digital system in the region. The Japanese Digital Cellular (JDC) system is less well developed than GSM, and will not enter commercial service much before 1994. However, big non-Japanese manufacturers, such as Motorola and Sweden's Ericsson, have included JDC in their portfolios and Japanese vendors have an unrivalled reputation for commercialising technology in the type of mass consumer markets that digital cellular is intended to address. If cellular telephony is making headlines, paging is already the most pervasive, not to say audible, mobile communications service in the Asia Pacific region. CIT Research says that there are over 8.2m wide area pagers in the eight countries it surveyed and forecasts that this number will rise to 13m by 2001. In some countries pagers have already achieved the ubiquity of mass market consumer durables. In others, pagers are regarded as fashion accessories: the main target for paging vendors in Hong Kong is the 16- to 20-year age group. Hong Kong and Singapore have Asia's highest pager penetration rates with, respectively, 152 and 130 receivers for every 1,000 population. The most dynamic market, however, is South Korea where the paging population doubled to 851,000 in 1991. Less glamorous than cellular telephony and less visible than paging, private mobile radio continues to make gains in the Asia Pacific market. The largest market of the eight analysed by CIT Research was Japan, with an installed base of 27m units at the beginning of this year. Trunked networks are becoming important and should dominate terminal sales worth nearly Dollars 930m, at current prices, in 2001. While technologies such as Japan's Personal Handy Phone and the Digital European Cordless Telecommunications system (DECT) are being energetically promoted in the Asia Pacific region, the surprise hit of the cordless sector so far is CT-2 telepoint. In stark contrast to its disappointing start in the UK, and the rather cautious welcome it has received in most other European countries, Asia has taken to the CT-2 wireless payphone service in a big way. Hong Kong has two services and two more have been licensed. Hutchison's Tien Dey Seen service was switched on at the end of March and had signed up around 20,000 subscribers by mid-May. A second service, Chevalier's Bo Bo Tung, went live at the end of May and picked up 4,000 users in a matter of weeks. Mr Neil Montefiori, Chevalier's managing director, promises cordless office switchboards, interactive voice mail linked to paging and two-way calling on his system later this year. Singapore's Callzone CT-2 telepoint service was launched earlier this year to scenes reminiscent of the opening the first MacDonald's hamburger outlet in Moscow. According to Mr Sung Sio Ma, head of Singapore Telecom International's arm, the company's stock of 10,000 CT-2 terminals was sold out in one week and the carrier had to back-peddle on promoting the service further. At the end of May, Callzone customers numbered over 18,000, and Mr Sung was forecasting that CT-2 subscriptions would soon outnumber the island state's 80,000 cellular telephone users. All of this is a far cry from CT-2's muted performance in its region of origin and is something of an embarrassment for the assorted pundits who had already written the obituary of the service. But as Mr John Carrington, director for mobile and new services at Cable and Wireless has remarked, even the great and good are not right all the time: 'I think that the key to telepoint is that, not for the first time, many experts got it wrong. There is a large demand for low cost communications which do not have the full functionality of cellular. Telepoint meets that need and seems set for a bright future.'</p>

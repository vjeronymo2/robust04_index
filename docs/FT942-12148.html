			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Travel: FT Round the World Ski Expedition Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world expedition. They began the year in North America and are now in Europe. Arnie reports: At last - good weather. Early in the week, it was still snowing quite heavily in Alpe d'Huez, allegedly one of the sunniest ski resorts in France. But later, in the spectacular resort of La Grave, we enjoyed a stunning day of bright sunshine and oceans of fresh powder. At Alpe d'Huez, Lucy and I accessed the skiing area from Vaujany - the only people in the 160-person cable car on the way up - and down. With luck, rather than judgment, we keep arriving in ski resorts the day before they close. In Courchevel, Meribel, Les Menuires and Val Thorens we played 'hunt the lift that is working'. Almost a year to the day since the skiing accident which had left him in a wheelchair, Mike Browne, boss of Snow + Rock, arrived in Meribel to ski with us. 'This is the moment I have waited for for a year,' he said. The thought of accompanying the FT's expedition had been one of the chief driving forces in Mike learning to ski again, using a specially adapted ski-bob. He was able to use the button lifts and chairs, and although paralysed from the waist, skied incredibly well using 'outrider' skis with his arms. Mike also delivered, as he had promised to do before his accident, replacements for some of our worn, damaged or lost equipment, including the vital Avocet watch which records vertical feet, and heels for my ski boots, which had been worn down by walking on so many snowless tracks after a day's skiing. Worn heels can become dangerous as they can allow boots to release unexpectedly from bindings - the last thing we need with eight months of skiing still ahead of us. On our last afternoon in the Trois Vallees we were tempted to ski the three couloirs on Courchevel's piste map. My daughter Samantha, who had joined us for a week, had never skied a couloir before, let alone three in one afternoon. Chess No. 1019: 1 Qh7+ Kf8 2 Qxg7+ Kxg7 3 dxc5+ Kf8 4 Rh8+ Ke7 5 Bf6 mate.</p>

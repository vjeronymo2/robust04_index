			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies (SJAC)  has made a survey and submitted a preliminary report on the FY92  sales by the space industry. The total figure for the sales,  which consisted mainly of craft such as launch vehicles and of  software, was &yen;308,007 million, a drop of about 16 percent  from the previous year.    The total of the spacecraft sales was &yen;175,005 million  (an increase of 12 percent over the previous year). The sales of  the H-II launch vehicle, manufactured with local technologies,  dropped to &yen;53,465 million (a 12.6 percent decrease) as it  was nearing its completion. On the other hand, space shuttle and  satellite sales increased by &yen;2,206 million (a 82.4 percent  increase) and &yen;120,034 million (a 37.2 percent increase),  respectively.    Of the total sales of &yen;308,007 million, 85 percent  consisted of domestic sales, and the rest was export. However,  ``30-35 percent of the domestic sales were double-counted''  (SJAC's comment), as they were counted twice in some cases, once  when the government ordered, and again when the principal  contractors issued orders to subcontractors. Therefore, the  actual size of sales is smaller than what appeared in the  statistics.    On the other hand, the ``services provided,'' which are  tabulated separately because of their nature of business,  consisted mainly of leasing business, and the total sales were  &yen;58,740 million. Because of the increasing use of  communication and broadcasting satellites, the sales figure more  than doubled over the previous year.    The survey was done in August of this year, with  questionnaires mailed out to 85 firms involved in space  development; 66 companies responded, and the results were  processed to make the report.</p>

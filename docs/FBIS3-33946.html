			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, Feb 1, INA--THE BAGHDAD OBSERVER said today  that the UN Special Commission expert Charles Duelfer, American,  recently concluded a short visit to Iraq after holding  discussions with the Iraqi officials on the long-term monitoring  of Iraq's weapons. Duelfer also discussed with the Iraqis the  visit of UN Sanctions Commission UNSCOM chief Rolf Ekeus to Iraq  which is expected to start on February 2.    A paper editorial added, however, the main job of Duelfer in  Baghdad was to discuss with Iraqi counterparts a plan set by  UNSCOM to implement the monitoring system of Iraq's weapons.    Duelfer told reporters in Baghdad shortly before his  departure that his talks with the Iraqi side were significant  and many points were clarified.    The editorial further said, Duelfer wanted to tell reporters  that "there is still more to be done", he had made it clear that  the monitoring system needs more time, even more than six  months, the period set by Ekeus six months ago.    But this "more to be done" is not by Iraq, but the UNSCOM.  Iraq has accepted UN Security Council Resolution 715 which is  based on the monitoring svstem. The time is, therefore, needed  by the UN body to implement the technicalities of its resolution  and Iraq has expressed its readiness to provide help and this  was stressed by Duelfer.    The editorial said before the arrival of Duelfer, Rolf Ekeus  said in a press interview that monitoring would take a year to  prove its efficiency. Ekeus, however, had said before that such  a system needs six months to be fixed. Now, he extends that to  one year which means the Security Council would need another  year to think of lifting the trade sanctions on Iraq or not.    However, the Security Council resolutions state that if Iraq  agrees to the monitoring system, the Security Council should  lift the trade sanctions even partially.    It is quiet clear from the statements made by the various UN  officials that the U.S. Administration is dictating the Security  Council what to do in order to prolong the trade sanctions.  This is quiet clear through the recent every two-month  UN-official discussions held by the Security Council members on  the trade sanctions on Iraq. The U.S. and British  representatives' stands were rather firm to prolong the  sanctions while those of France, Russia and China are rather in  favour of lifting them.    Any observer would see clearly how the U.S. is directly  influencing the UN and its organisations. When the six-month  period which was earlier given to Iraq to assess its position  towards the implementation of resolution 715 becomes nearer, the  U.S. extends the period to one year and Ekeus and his aides have  got the message and they started talking about the year time and  there is more to be done and so on.    We hope that this time Ekeus would come to Iraq carrying  UNSCOM's and not U.S. demands because this would only complicate  the situation, the editorial concluded.</p>

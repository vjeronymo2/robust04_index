			<p>BFN     [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis stressed that the Greek  Cypriot side's demilitarization proposal was, is, and will  continue to be on the negotiating table. He added that at the  same time Greece and Cyprus will do everything to safeguard  Cyprus' independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.    The president made this statement this morning at the  Presidential Palace while receiving trainers and students from  the Greek Air Force War School and the Greek Navy Permanent  Officers School, who are on a training trip to Cyprus. Kliridhis  stressed that the joint defense doctrine between Greece and  Cyprus is significant for Cyprus. He said that he is satisfied  because the Greek Navy, Air Force, and Army are present in  Cyprus because the defense doctrine includes all three.</p>

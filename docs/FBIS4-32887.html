			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 28 May (EFE) -- Today, the Venezuelan  Government announced a series of changes in President Rafael  Caldera's cabinet. These changes are designed to improve  coherence in the government team. According to Guillermo  Alvarez, chief of the Central Information Office, the new  development minister will be Alberto Poletto, president of the  Foreign Trade Institute [ICE]. Poletto will continue to be  president of the ICE, and in the future, this office will become  the ministry of industry and commerce.    Luis Carlos Palacios, the current development minister, will  head the Central Office of Coordination and Planning. Palacios  will replace Enzo del Bufalo who, according to the press,  resigned because of serious differences with the other members  of the economic cabinet.    Ciro Zaa, currently minister of urban development, has been  appointed transport and communications minister. Zaa replaces  Cesar Quintini who was accused of not being willing to attack  the corruption spotted in the department by former Deputy  Transport and Communications Minister Rafael Iribarren.    Francisco Gonzalez, currently president of the Urban  Development Fund, will replace Ciro Zaa as the new minister of  urban development. The Urban Development Fund will shortly come  under the Urban Development Ministry.    One of the changes that surprised all the local political  observers took place in the Venezuelan Investment Fund,  responsible for the privatization process. Abdon Vivas Teran,  head of the Venezuelan Investment Fund, has been replaced by  Carlos Bernardez, a former president of the Bank of Venezuela,  the oldest private bank in Venezuela.    The chief of the Central Information Office also announced  that Alfredo Gruber will be the new president of the Venezuelan  Guayana Corporation, the most powerful state-run business group.  Gruber will replace Francisco Layrisse who, a few days ago,  announced that he wishes to return to private practice.    The latest addition to the cabinet, announced today, has  been  the appointment of Pompeyo Marquez, currently a minister without  portfolio, as coordinator for the government's social programs.  The new members of the cabinet will be sworn in on Monday [30  May] and will start to work immediately, Alvarez said.</p>

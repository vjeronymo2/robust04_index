			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report under the "In Brief" rubric] </F>   [Text] Moscow -- In the first three months of 1994, Russia  did not sign a single contract with the main foreign grain  suppliers, the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations advises. Grain imports over the period did not exceed  372,000 tonnes, or only slightly more than 12 percent of the  same period last year. This grain was delivered under 1993  carry-over contracts. In the first quarter of 1994, the amounts  of purchases of many other types of food including meat, white  sugar, and pasta continued to decline.</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Survey of European Airports - Manchester (3): Testing time for new technology has arrived - A look at the nuts and bolts of the new terminal THE BASIC specification of Manchester's new Terminal 2 was simple: it had to be able to take eight fully-laden Boeing 747 jumbo jets, wingtip to wingtip on its apron, and be able to deal with all 4,000 people aboard them if they all arrived or departed together. Translating this into reinforced concrete and the systems to go with it has produced something overwhelming. It cost Pounds 265m. At 1m sq ft, Terminal 2 is one of the largest single buildings in Britain. The whole site area is 1m sq metres, enough for 200 soccer pitches. It contains 35 miles of pipework, enough to stretch to Liverpool, and 125 miles of telecommunications wiring, enough to reach Carlisle; 13,000 cubic metres of concrete were used in the foundations; the 17,000 pieces of structural steelwork it consumed weigh 10,000 tonnes and comprised 1 per cent of the UK production of the same in 1989-90. A normal mix of large and small aircraft using the terminal, would enable 14 of them on the apron at once. The departure areas have more than 3,000 seats. There are nine restaurants, cafes or bars - and 38 blocks of toilets. The view down the length of the building from the inside is 614 metres long. Basically, the terminal has a large central core, with two arms stretched out straight on each side of it. The adjustable bridges to the doors of the aircraft that will use branch off the arms. Each arm has two floors, a lower one for arriving passengers, the upper for those departing, so there is complete segregation. On each floor, moving walkways will minimise the exercise involved in getting between the central core and the gates to the aircraft. Baggage handling and sorting systems are the latest. 'They are fully automatic,' says Mr Howard Shiplee, head of the Amec team which managed the terminal's construction. 'Bar code readers can read the code on a luggage label from any angle, including upside down, with a very high level of success and send it to the appropriate tray. It cost Pounds 48m, but it is state-of-the-art. 'One of our big challenges was that standards change and improve continuously. It's not just equipment, but statutes and regulations. We left as much fitting out as late as possible because we wanted to meet the latest level of technology and regulations. We have done many things at the last minute that we are sure the people who use this terminal will appreciate. About one third of the terminal is taken up with offices and support services. Indeed, it comprises a community in its own right, with its own gas-fired power station and a waste heat recovery system to service the whole airport and take it off the national grid. Airlines have been keen to become users, although British Airways will stay in Manchester's Terminal 1. Most long-haul flights, however, will be at Terminal 2, including those of Air Canada, American Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Delta, Emirates, Gulf Air, Pakistan International, Qantas, Singapore Airlines and South African Airways. Other regular users will be Turkish Airlines, Air Malta, Air 2000, Britannia Airways, Cyprus Airways and Euro Cypria. Between them they will be able to handle 6m passengers a year. Because the terminal has been built to have extra sections built on to one end, it can be expanded to double this figure as demand grows. In spite of these large numbers of potential users, however, it is unlikely they will feel hemmed in. In the central departures area the overall impression is of space, with high ceilings and plenty of floor area. Even Sir Alan Cockshaw, Amec's chairman and an airports veteran in terms of both using them and building them, is moved by it. 'It's beautiful, this. It really is magnificent. There's nothing in Terminal 4 at Heathrow to compare. You just don't get this sort of space in airports generally,' he says. The proof, however, will come when real passengers start using it in large numbers, putting uneven and variable loads on the heating and ventilating system, and experiencing at first hand whether the luggage label bar code readers can do better than those at their supermarkets, which occasionally miss. All has gone well for Terminal 2 so far, thanks to human brains and hands. Making it all work properly when the paying customers are subjecting it to commercial demand, however, will require a different type of management - service. The real test, therefore, starts now.</p>

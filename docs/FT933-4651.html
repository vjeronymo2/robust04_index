			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Recruitment: Time to face up to the final score - Not everybody has the luck to be in a position to look ahead with nary a backward glance 'FORWARD, forward let us range,' urged Tennyson, adding for good measure: 'Let the great world spin for ever down the ringing grooves of change.' And who could fail to admire such a firmly future-orientated policy? Even so, not everyone has the luck to be in a position to look bravely ahead with nary a glance backward. Take for instance the Jobs column's present writer who returns from the summer break today with over a thousand appearances in this corner of the FT behind him, but only 20 more to go before retiring. While that may simply herald welcome relief to you out there who at worst may be fated to read them, it presents somewhat of a problem to me who has to write them. Indeed, having not been in such a situation before, I've spent a few holiday hours wondering what to do about it. True, the 20 columns left to me add up to about 26,000 words still to be penned, which seems more than enough to go on with. So I shall half take Tennyson's advice by discussing any new developments noticeably relevant to highly skilled work, as well as updating the customary reports on surveys of pay and so on. But the words remaining are as little to the near 1 1/2 m already churned out, some of which had a bit of thought behind them. Accordingly, I'll also be casting back in hope of piecing together the odd useful lesson emerging from the past, which in the Jobs column's case is longish. It first appeared in November 1968, although it went absent from January 1970 before returning to start its present run three years later. Whatever Tennyson says, such backward glancing is not only irresistible, but sensible. It's all very well for him to bang on about letting the great world spin for ever etc. But the fact is that neither he nor anyone else could stop it. The best we can do is try to benefit from its future changes by behaving wisely, and hints on how to do so often lie in changes that have happened before. Admittedly, the one that has probably had the widest impact on this column's readership, has taken most effect in only the last few years. It is the scrapping of whole layers of management by numerous employers, in business at any rate, and the ditching of in-house staff furnishing less than central services in favour of buying them in when needed from external concerns. But the portents were surely there to be spotted well in advance. For instance, in 1968 it was the case at least in Britain that young people who did well in the academic system might fairly safely expect to be handed life-long careers. Provided they impressed a university recruiter from a big organisation, and then avoided badly blotching their copybook, they could count on an above-average standard of living until they were dead. Moreover, as some of those so recruited rose to command the then thriving established outfits, it seemed reasonable to suppose that managers with the skills to ensure an ever more prosperous future could be produced by the same means. All that we needed to do was expand the existing higher educational system, and top it off with postgraduate management schools. Yet the flaw in that idea was soon apparent as established organisations began falling by the wayside before the first higher educational expansion was complete. Nor, given the heavier crashes that have accompanied further academic expansions, can we sensibly expect still stronger doses of the same supposed elixir to work henceforth. The problem is to find better ways of identifying and honing effective skills. And since I think past columns have chanced upon some useful clues, I shall try to develop them in the remaining weeks. There will also be more about the Laws of Organisational Stupidity and other related themes. . . but not just yet. FOR the moment I'm turning to one of the aforementioned customary reports on salary surveys, summarised in the table below. As in previous years, the figures are drawn from the most recent cross-Europe study by the Wyatt management consultancy. The full report - which covers 17 countries and of course contains a far greater wealth of data than is given here - is priced at Pounds 1,250 plus VAT. For each of the 10 countries I have listed, the table ranks the directors in charge of the various functional departments by the money value that companies evidently put on them. The basis of the ranking is the gross pay received in cash, salary plus bonuses and so on, of a typical chief executive in the same land: a figure that is given in italics under the country's name, with other currencies converted into sterling at the London closing exchange rates of last Friday. Below that come the various directors, ranked by their gross pay shown as percentages of the pay of their home country's chief. As may be seen, the values apparently placed on the various functions vary considerably, although finance takes pride of place six times out of 10. The differential the chief enjoys over the average for all subordinate directors taken together is highest in Italy, and lowest in the UK.</p>

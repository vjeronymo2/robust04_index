			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: IEA sees more signs of rising oil demand FURTHER SIGNS of an upturn in oil demand are highlighted in this month's report from the International Energy Agency, the west's energy monitoring body, which predicts a 1.5 per cent rise in second-quarter demand among members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. This follows a 1.8 per cent rise in the first quarter, and the estimate has been revised upwards after unexpectedly strong US demand in April. The IEA has raised its US second-quarter consumption growth figure to 2.5 per cent. This is expected to help OECD consumption grow to 37.4m barrels a day, although demand is likely to remain unchanged in Europe and the Pacific. Growing expectations of a tight market in the third quarter have already seen oil prices gain more than Dollars 1.50 a barrel since the decision by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries last month to leave its output ceiling unchanged. Brent crude for July delivery last week breached the Dollars 21-a-barrel barrier for the first time in seven months. It closed yesterday at Dollars 21.07 1/2 , down 17 1/2 cents. In spite of Opec's agreed ceiling of 22.98m barrels a day, IEA estimates its real production as 23.5m b/d in May, in line with a survey by the Reuter news agency last week. However, a report from the magazine Petroleum Intelligence Weekly puts Opec output at 23.81m b/d in May, with increased production from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, although much of the increase was earmarked for storage. Production in the former Soviet Union continued to decline, the IEA says, by around 12 per cent year-on-year, averaging around 9.4m b/d in April, down from 9.5m b/d in March. The decline was most severe in the Russian republic. But exports recovered in April and early May. The IEA says total OECD demand for 1992 is likely to average 38.6m b/d, an increase of 1.5 per cent over 1991, with moderate growth in all regions. World oil demand is forecast to be 67.0m b/d, an increase of 0.6m b/d over 1991. Market analysts at Kleinwort Benson, the London merchant bank and securities group, said the IEA's forecasts supported their view that the price of Brent crude was likely to average Dollars 20 for the year.</p>

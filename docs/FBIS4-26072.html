			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Shi Zilong (0670 1311 7893) entitled "Society's </F> Causes and Countermeasures for Abducting and Trafficking in  Women"]    [Text] Our region is one of the whole country's main  provinces with the inflow of abducted women. Although the  governments at various levels and the departments concerned have  transferred and organized a large number of personnel to deal  special blows to the women abductors and traders on several  occasions, to investigate and arrest human traders, and to  rescue the abducted women, the number of abducted women is still  on a rise.    Through investigations in Qingshuihe County of Ulanqab  League, we discovered that there are deep social backgrounds for  the emergence and development of the criminal activities of  abducting and trafficking in women.    1. Abducting and trafficking in women is a strange embryo  produced by the gigantic transformation of society. Since the  implementation of the production responsibility system in rural  areas, movement in population flow has become more lively.  Particularly, most of the areas with the outflow of population  are mountain areas where economic development is rather  backward, the living environment is very bad, people live a hard  life, and there is a relative surplus in the population. While  these women lack the know-how to enter society, they have the  desire and courage to do so, and have become the main baggage of  human traders. For instance, women from Sichuan comprise the  majority of the women abducted and marketed in Qingshuihe  County, and women from Mianyang area account for two-thirds of  the total from Sichuan. Most of these women were abducted and  sold to Qingshuihe County by swallowing the bait of job,  business, and trip offers.    2. Men in areas where there is an influx of abducted women  have strong desires for marriage. This has weakened society's  attention to the women abduction and marketing activities. Most  areas with the inflow of abducted women are economically  backward areas, with a sparse population, and a wide discrepancy  in the ratio of men and women. For instance, the ratio of men  and women in Qingshuihe County is 115 to 100, with 8,716 more  men than women. Some male adults in this county only rely on  females from other places to resolve their marriage problems.  So, the people maintain that an abducted woman can help offset  the number of bachelors. This kind of normal marriage desire  weakens the people's understanding about and attention to the  criminal activities of abducting and trafficking in women.  Under such circumstances, it is difficult to form a social  foundation under which all the people deal blows to women  abductors and traders.    3. The extremely complicated situation enhances the  difficulties in dealing blows to human abductors and traders.  By the end of 1992, 1,880 women from other parts of the country  flowed into Qingshuihe County. Of them, 1,107 women were  volunteers, 756 were abducted and trafficked in, and 17 ganged  up with the swindlers to engage in women abduction and trading  activities. Besides, there are a countless number of women who  have escaped after being abducted and trafficked in. It is thus  clear that of the incoming population from another places, there  are both lawful marriage partners and women that have been  abducted and trafficked in. Simultaneously, there are swindling  activities. Such circumstances have objectively brought  difficulties to the law enforcement departments in fixing the  nature of the cases. Particularly, it is more difficult to  punish the human traders who have escaped with unlawful gains  before the women abduction and trading cases are exposed.    4. Buying and marketing marriage partners becomes the  hotbed of abduction and trading of women. The buying and  marketing of marriage partners is extremely popular in areas  where there is an influx of abducted women. Money becomes the  basic condition for marriage. A man in the rural areas of  Qingshuihe County needs to spend over 10,000 yuan in cash gifts  to marry a woman. Therefore, it is very attractive in some  poverty-stricken areas to buy an abducted woman with four to  five thousand yuan. Some people are even willing to run the  risk of losing both women and money, of being punished by laws,  to buy abducted women. High incomes also encourage human  traders to defy laws and ceaselessly engage themselves in  criminal activities.    Therefore, we maintain that dealing blows to the criminal  activities of abducting and trading in women requires systematic  engineering. We should mobilize all social forces to deal blows  to these activities.    1. We should be determined to resolutely uproot the soil of  abducting and trading in women and buying and marketing marriage  partners. The party committees and governments at various  levels should put the elimination of the remnants of feudalism,  such as in the buying and marketing marriage partners, onto  their work agenda, regard it as an important content of the  spiritual civilization of rural areas, and conscientiously  attend to the basic work relating to attacking women abductors  and traders. Simultaneously, we should upgrade the quality of  the young people in rural areas in line with the rural areas'  education on culture, sciences, technologies, and laws. We  should not only have the people in rural areas understand that  purchasing abducted women is a criminal activity, but also make  them respect the personal rights and interests of the women and  to seek a lofty, civilized family life.    2. We should further draw a clear line of demarcation  between  guilt and nonguilt to enhance the effectiveness of the attack  against criminals. Specifically speaking, we should draw a  clear line of demarcation between normal marriage with  nonnatives and crimes of human abduction and trade, between  marriages of normal matchmaking and crimes of human abduction  and trade, between abduction and trading and swindling in  partnership, and between women who are willing to stay and those  who are being forced to stay and dare not ask for rescue. In  line with the trend of an increasing number of nonnative women  in areas where there is an influx in population, we should adopt  the principle of coordinating persuasion with punishment to deal  blows to the criminal activities of abducting and trading in  women. The matchmakers who act as go-betweens in introducing  marriage partners, either on a voluntary basis or through  complete formalities, are allowed to ask for appropriate amounts  of service charges. However, those who abduct and trade in  women, gang up with one another to engage in swindling  activities, and force women to engage in criminal activities,  must not be tolerated but should resolutely be attacked.    3. We should develop the economy and strengthen the setup of  democracy and legal system. This is the final way for solving  the problems of abducting and trading in women.</p>

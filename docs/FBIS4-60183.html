			<p>BFN     [Text] The Yemeni Unionist Grouping Party has announced  its rejection of the criminal al-Bid's proclamation of  secession, calling it a catastrophe for the homeland. Brother  'Umar al-Jawi, secretary general of the party, in a statement  carried by AFP, termed al-Bid's secessionist decision a  dangerous and catastrophic move.    Meanwhile, the Democratic Nasirite Party, the National  Democratic Front, and the Socialist Nationalist Party, today  came out strongly against the traitor al-Bid's declaration of  secession. They emphasized that a rabid, bloody gang within the  ranks of the Socialist Party afflicted with megalomania has no  business determining the fate of the Yemeni people. They  described this gang as a spiteful group with a black history of  scheming against our people.    A joint statement issued by the three parties today said  they, along with all the worthy and good Yemeni citizens, stand  for keeping the Yemeni unity intact and take the side of its  defenders. They place themselves, the statement added, at the  disposal of the unionist leadership to defend the gains of the  homeland -- unity and democracy.    Yemeni unity was made possible by the will of the entire  people of the country and their sacrifices and struggles. The  statement said the people will adhere to their unity for all  time and urged all the honest and good forces to chase the  secessionist gang and keep it from realizing a separatist scheme  funded from across the border -- not even on a single inch of  Yemeni territory. The three parties called on unionists and  good citizens to give every support to the unionist leadership  to safeguard this splendid, historic achievement.    Meanwhile, the three parties have cabled the brother  chairman  and members of the Presidential Council about their strong  condemnation of al-Bid's secessionist move. Along with all our  Yemeni people, the cable read, we are on your side as a symbol  of unity and democracy and national sovereignty and legality.</p>

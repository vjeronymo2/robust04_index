			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Meyer's warning on margins hits shares Shares in Meyer fell 11 per cent yesterday as the building products group accompanied its half-year results with a warning that pressure on margins and a slowdown in sales cast a shadow over current trading. Pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of September were 44 per cent ahead at Pounds 27.4m (Pounds 19m), helped by a Pounds 1.1m contribution from property disposals, and in line with market expectations. However, the 4.2p maintained dividend disappointed analysts, some of whom were forecasting a 10 per cent increase. Mr John Dobby, chief executive, said that the dividend payment was an attempt to redress the balance between the interim and the final, which had traditionally split one third to two thirds. 'The dividend payment is not a reflection of our performance.' Group turnover rose 11 per cent to Pounds 669.3m (Pounds 600.8m). Earnings per share advanced 27 per cent to 14.4p (11.3p). The shares closed down 44p at 359p. Operating profits from the Jewson division rose 27 per cent to Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 10.3m) on sales 14 per cent ahead at Pounds 245.4m (Pounds 215.1m). Bulk sales were buoyant, although these were subject to lower margins. The repairs, maintenance and improvement market, which has traditionally provided the basis for Jewson's earnings growth, was subdued. Profits from forest products rose 13 per cent to Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 8.6m) on sales 15 per cent ahead at Pounds 219m (Pounds 190.4m). There was also an improved contribution from the Dutch division of Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 6.2m), while the German business contributed Pounds 500,0000 (Pounds 300,000). Since September, the group had experienced a slowdown in sales growth brought about chiefly by the rise in interest rates and the consequent effect on the housing market, according to Mr Dobby. There were also raw materials pricing pressures which were being passed on but increasingly facing resistance from the beleaguered building trade. He added that given the current difficult trading environment, the group would concentrate its efforts on improving 'operational efficiencies.' COMMENT Meyer's management did little yesterday to discourage the downbeat assessment of the group's prospects. Pricing pressures at Jewson, the group's biggest earner, look likely to continue as it fights to maintain market share by increasing its lower margin bulk sales. Profits for 1995-96 are forecast to fall in a range between Pounds 60m and Pounds 65m, giving earnings of some 33.5p and a p/e of 10.5 times. This compares poorly with rivals Travis Perkins (11.8 times) and Wolseley (12.2 times) - a position Meyer has traditionally found itself in. Worth a hold, but the sector as a whole is likely to remain in the doldrums.</p>

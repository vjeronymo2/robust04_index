Nilsson's theory is described, and its limitations  discussed. The main role in this model is played by the concept  of possibility distribution and a method of determining the  distribution from a single knowledge base. This enables one to  include a consideration of subjective and inexact expert  information. The general properties of this model are studied.  The complexity of calculating the possibility distribution  increases exponentially with the size of the knowledge base .  Moreover, one may only use a small part of the knowledge base or  only some of the deductions from a portion of the knowledge  base. This method is therefore inefficient for large knowledge  bases. Semantic aspects of the logic are studied and form the  basis for efficient approximate methods of calculating  possibility distributions. The model of fuzzy probabilistic  logic is actually a family of different logics; aspects common  to the entire family are studied. References 3 (Western).</p>

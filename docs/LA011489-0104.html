			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> STARR PREFERS TO WATCH, WAIT IN PLANNING NFL FRANCHISE IN BALTIMORE  </P> <P> Taking an aggressive posture relative to eventually owning and directing a new  professional football team in Baltimore isn't in the game plan of former Green  Bay quarterback Bart Starr. In the parlance of the sport, he and his associates  are playing it soft. They are waiting and watching before making any kind of a  commitment.  </P> <P> Starr and at least one interested partner, John Colbrunn, will be here Monday  to huddle with the Maryland Sports Advisory Commission. On two previous trips,  Starr, a much-respected Hall of Fame member, has met with Gov. William Donald  Schaefer. They've come to know and like each other.  </P> <P> Putting a franchise in Baltimore, if and when the National Football League  gives the green light for expansion, is of considerable concern to Starr. But  he's not going to offer anything definitive on the matter. It's all a question  of timing.  </P> <P> "We are merely sharing information with friends in what we know about the  possibility of the league eventually adding new teams," Starr said. Then, three  more times he reiterated the same words: "We are merely sharing information."  </P> <P> But, obviously, Starr and those with him are impressed with Baltimore. "I've  always felt that way," he said. "I played there enough to know the enthusiasm  of the people and visited in the off-season to know what it's like. There's an  electricity that is obvious to an outsider. I have respect for the fans and for  Baltimore. They deserve a franchise."  </P> <P> Pressed to express a personal thought on where Baltimore would rank while in  expansion competition with other challengers, such as Oakland, St. Louis,  Jacksonville and Memphis, he quickly answered: "At the top of the list."  </P> <P> On a visit to Baltimore in mid-June, when he came here at the invitation of a  friend, Phyllis Brotman, president of Image Dynamics Inc., Starr asked his  longtime rival on the field and the opponent he admired more than any other,  fellow Hall of Famer John Unitas, to spend some time with him.  </P> <P> Again, no promises were made but it's a natural to link Starr and Unitas. Is it  his hope if Baltimore has a future for Starr that Unitas would be included with  him? "Very much so," he answered. Then a pause . . . followed by "if we are  fortunate enough to be selected."  </P> <P> There's no way Starr is going to speak out prematurely, issue bold statements  or endanger the good will and progress that has been made in what, up to now,  has been a passive exploration of what is still a nebulous situation.  </P> <P> He did say that in his group, which also includes Tom Stoen, whom he describes  as "the most honest man I have ever known"; Joe Foss, a World War II Medal of  Honor winner, later governor of North Dakota and the first commissioner of the  American Football League; and Willie Davis, a former Packer teammate who is one  of the most successful black business leaders in the nation.  </P> <P> Starr is looking forward to a return to Baltimore. But when asked to talk about  the franchise possibility, he is cautious and concerned, realizing there's no  point in offering bold predictions.  </P></p>

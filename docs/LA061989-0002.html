			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Scientists have for the first time found high levels of ozone and acid rain  over thousands of miles of virgin rain forests of Central Africa, the New York  Times said in a report from Freiburg, West Germany. It said the discovery by  separate teams of scientists from France and West Germany was particularly  alarming because the pollution exists throughout the year and is comparable to  levels found in industrialized Europe and North America. The scientists said  the pollution is largely caused by fires set by farmers and herdsmen to clear  shrubs and to stimulate the growth of crops and grass.  </P></p>

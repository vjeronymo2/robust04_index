These teachers from high  schools in the public sector, who had been on strike since 24  November to back demands for better salaries, were hit by the  measure after their supervisors reported their "irregular  absence." On 23 January, 73 other high school teachers were  dismissed for similar reasons. The previous day, the government  had issued a recruitment notice to cope with the possible  refusal of teachers to resume work.</p>

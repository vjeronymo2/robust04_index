			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OIL SPILL OFF ALASKA CONTINUES TO DISRUPT SALMON FISHING  </P> <P> Drew Sparlin has been spending his days in a 40-foot boat on the choppy waters  of Cook Inlet, doing something hundreds of other commercial fishermen in this  part of Alaska can only think about this year.  </P> <P> He's been fishing.  </P> <P> Sparlin's boat, the Lady Lee, is one of a half-dozen vessels leaving the  fishing port of Kenai every day in search of migrating salmon -- and globs of  floating oil -- as part of a test to see how much oil is in the fishing grounds  of Central Cook Inlet.  </P> <P> Until this week, Sparlin had found only fish. But that changed Wednesday  afternoon, when he discovered a series of foamy, rust-brown streaks of floating  oil in an area scheduled to be opened for fishing later in the week. As a  result, another salmon opening was canceled.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Spill Causes Havoc  </P> <P> More than three months after the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince William  Sound, causing the biggest oil spill in the nation's history, oil in Alaska  waters continues to cause havoc in the state's billion-dollar salmon fishery.  </P> <P> The first two weeks in July would normally be the peak period for commercial  fishing in dozens of areas along the south central Alaska coastline. Five  different species of salmon migrate by the millions from the Pacific Ocean to  the freshwater streams of their birth, and the bays and passages of Prince  William Sound, Kodiak Island, Cook Inlet and the Alaska Peninsula are normally  filled with fishing vessels and floating processing ships.  </P> <P> But because of lingering oil, only a few of the fishing grounds in this part of  Alaska have been opened this summer by state fishing authorities. Others have  either been closed for the season or indefinitely delayed. The places range  from bays in Prince William Sound where oil still coats the beaches to remote  regions as far as 500 miles away where wisps of oily sheen have been seen.  </P> <P> There have been no reports of oil contaminated fish. Oil floats and fish swim  beneath the surface of the water, avoiding it. Yet state officials and the  fishing industry, fearing that even the hint of oiled salmon will taint  Alaska's reputation for pristine-quality seafood, have instituted a so-called  "zero-tolerance" policy, banning all fishing in places where even small amounts  of oil are detected.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Find Streaks, Tar Balls  </P> <P> What he and others have found, more than 200 miles from where the tanker  grounded, has not been huge amounts of pollution. Instead, they have found  occasional foamy streaks of emulsified oil known as mousse, and hard, black tar  balls that have evolved from the crude oil that spilled March 24.  </P> <P> "It's all so scattered you can't go out and pick it up or skim it up," said  Sparlin, who has fished for salmon and herring for 24 years. "People don't know  what to do. In this district alone there's 600 boats. You've got a couple  thousand people, just right here, sitting and doing nothing. No one knows what  to expect . . . everybody's disgusted."  </P> <P> The Exxon spill came at a time when record salmon catches were expected in many  places. In areas beyond the oil's reach, such as Bristol Bay or in southeast  Alaska, fishing has been stronger than ever this year, and fish from those  areas are being airlifted by the ton to canneries in this region. No one is  sure how much of the season can be salvaged in the areas affected by oil, but  hopes are growing dimmer as the days pass and new seasons are delayed.  </P> <P> In Kodiak, 250 miles south of Prince William Sound, hundreds of boats are  docked in the harbor, their crews awaiting the latest word on which areas will  be opened. Earlier this week, only three of 52 fishing districts were open  there. Fishermen are afraid to leave town because of the possibility of a  sudden opening, but there has been little fishing since the first closure a  month ago.  </P> <P> "You see people walking around kind of going crazy" said Rhonda Ellingson,  whose husband, Rick, began netting salmon off southern Kodiak Island last week  after a three-week delay. "There's nothing to do. You're supposed to be out  fishing making money, and instead they're living on a tied-up seine boat with  five other guys and not knowing when they're going out."  </P> <P> Exxon has agreed to pay fishermen for any documented losses. And some of them  have gone on the Exxon payroll, renting out their boats for shore clean-up  jobs, or like Sparlin, participating in test fisheries with state biologists  and Exxon claims adjusters on board. But many fishermen are skeptical that  Exxon will pay the full amount of their losses. In Cook Inlet, fishermen  grumble that they are still awaiting settlements from a smaller tanker spill  two summers ago.  </P> <P> David Hulen, a staff writer for the Anchorage Daily News, filed this story for  The Times.  </P></p>

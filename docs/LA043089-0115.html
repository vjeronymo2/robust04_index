			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRUISE VIEWS: ALASKA STILL A BUSY STOP  </P> <P> Despite last month's tragic Alaska oil spill, none of the nine ships scheduled  to sail through the Gulf this summer has changed itineraries.  </P> <P> Only nine of the 19 ships heading north will be sailing in Prince William Sound  and the Gulf of Alaska. The other 10 will cruise the Inside Passage between  Vancouver and pristine Glacier Bay, more than 400 miles from the spill area and  in the opposite direction to the prevailing oil flow.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prince William Sound  </P> <P> The first cruise ship scheduled to reach the Gulf this season is Regency  Cruises' Regent Sun, sailing from Vancouver on May 14. The Regent Sun and  sister ship Regent Sea cross Prince William Sound on northbound seven-day  itineraries and call at Valdez on the reverse southbound sailings.  </P> <P> "A few passengers have called and asked how it might affect their cruise," said  marketing vice president Jennifer Urquhart, "but we've had no cancellations.  They're worried about the environmental impact, but not afraid it will ruin the  cruise. . . . I think they're concerned whether they'll see the ecological  damage."  </P> <P> Urquhart said Regency is in constant touch with Valdez. "While we're very  concerned about the ecological damage, it's not impacting our plans at all,"  she said. "We could change and go to other ports, but our commitment to Valdez  came about because people want to see the oil pipeline."  </P> <P> Cunard's Sagafjord, which pioneered the Gulf of Alaska itinerary five years  ago, will see no changes in its 10- and 11-day Route of the Glaciers  itineraries that cross Prince William Sound and the Kenai fiords and call at  Valdez and Seward.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Travel Advisory  </P> <P> "The ship won't be there until the second week in June," said Cunard  spokeswoman Susan Alpert. "There's been no travel advisory against cruise ships  coming into the (Valdez) area. We wouldn't want to go up there if it were going  to damage the ship. And our passengers are not going to be in the water or on  shore at any of the islands."  </P> <P> On the other hand, Jim Sano, general manager of Innerasia Expeditions in San  Francisco, says his company's little 10-passenger boat Discovery, which sails  from Cordova in the eastern end of Prince William Sound, has had some  cancellations, including a group from the Cincinnati Museum of Natural History  who elected to wait for another year for their Alaskan wilderness cruise.  </P> <P> "Prior to the oil spill, our season was completely sold out, but we had some  cancellations afterward, due to the media (coverage)," Sano says.  </P> <P> "It's hard to persuade some passengers that the whole sound is not covered in  oil. We usually land on beaches and dig for clams and fish for salmon. The  people who canceled were significantly worried that these sorts of experiences  would be spoiled."  </P> <P> But Sano said that Mike Wiedmer of the Alaska Fish and Game Department reported  no influence on the wildlife along the Discovery's itinerary.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Spill Has Drifted  </P> <P> "The spill has drifted southwest out of the sound, and our cruises operate on  the eastern end of the sound, so we're not affected," Sano said. "Since our  ship carries only 10 passengers, we can pretty easily maneuver around and get  to places the big ships cannot."  </P> <P> Discovery captain Chuck Irvine recently flew over the vessel's normal route,  and Stephen Johnson, a 40-year resident of Cordova who works with Innerasia,  went ashore to check on the island beaches where the boat usually lands.  Neither saw any damage on the eastern side of the sound, Sano said.  </P> <P> "But," he added, "I think if you were to go up to the west side you'd see  considerable environmental impact."  </P> <P> A spokeswoman at San Francisco-based World Explorer Cruises said its ship  Universe will continue to Valdez on all of its sailings.  </P> <P> "We may try to get someone from the Coast Guard or an environmental group to  come on board there and speak to the passengers about the effect of the spill  on the community," she said.  </P> <P> "Also, I have a feeling people may be curious to see for themselves what this  biggest spill in the United States is like."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Line Keeps Schedule  </P> <P> After firsthand investigations, a team from Seattle-based Holland America  decided not to change any of the scheduled seven-day sailings of its flagship  Rotterdam between Vancouver and Seward, all of which call briefly at Valdez.  </P> <P> "We made a trip up there last week to check it out," said a spokesman. "We flew  over the face of Columbia Glacier and up College Fjord. There's nothing there;  (the oil) didn't go in there. You can't see anything until Seward, and that  should be cleared up by the beginning of the season. But environmentally it's  awful."  </P> <P> He said Holland America Westours and its employees have contributed $100,000  toward wildlife rescue efforts.  </P> <P> Skinner added that his company has had very few cancellations, probably no more  than the normal fallout for any season.  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based Princess Cruises, with three ships scheduled to cruise the  Gulf of Alaska and the Columbia Glacier area, will also stay with its published  itineraries for the summer.  </P> <P> "There's no interruption to shipping," said vice president Max Hall. "We adhere  to what the Coast Guard tells us, and we haven't heard anything from the Coast  Guard, pilots or port authorities, even from the port of Valdez, so we assume  everything will be normal."  </P> <P> For last-minute updates on Alaska cruises, call these numbers:  </P> <P> Cunard, toll-free (800) 528-6723; Holland America, (800) 426-0327; Innerasia,  (415) 922-0448; Princess, (800) 421-0522; Regency, (800) 457-5566, and World  Explorer, (800) 854-3835.  </P> <P> Lines sailing only the Inside Passage are Admiral, (800) 327-0271; Costa, (800)  477-6877; Royal Viking, (800) 422-8000; Special Expeditions, (800) 762-0003,  and TravAlaska, (800) 426-7702.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> In other cruise news, Aloha Pacific's Monterey, tied up at at a pier in  Honolulu since March 4 in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization filing, began  cruising again April 22. The nine-month-old line and its U.S. flagship were  bailed out with $1.7 million in operating expenses, mostly from Pacifico  Creative Services, a tour wholesale affiliate of Japan Creative Tours (JALPAK)  and a subsidiary of Japan Air Lines, and Sequoia Ventures, an affiliate of  Bechtel Investments.  </P> <P> The court is reviewing a proposed $12-million reorganization plan that provides  for a new company, S. S. Monterey Management Co. Inc., to be the general  managing partner. There is also an agreement under negotiation for a U.S. hotel  company (Radisson) to take over the hotel management and an affiliated tour  company (Carlson Travel Group) to take over marketing for the ship.  </P> <P> Passengers who had booked cruises canceled during the bankruptcy proceedings  will be offered special packages.  </P></p>

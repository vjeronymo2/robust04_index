The NESAVISIMAYA GAZETA daily reports about a regular round  of talks between representatives of major factions in the state  duma and a candidacy for its chairman. Mikhail Lapshin, leader  of the Agrarian Party, said in an interview with ITAR-TASS that  if "no consensus is reached on the nomination of a candidate to  the post of the duma speaker satisfying to all, then deputies'  votes will have to be counted." The newspaper says that this is  precisely what leaders of each of the factions will have to do,  with this procedure expected to be especially painful for the  "Russia's Choice" bloc since it will obviously lack its own  votes to overweight the votes of the Agrarian Party, the Russian  Communist Party and the Liberal Democratic Party.    The results of the elections to the new Russian Parliament  held on December 12 and the victory of the Russian Liberal  Democratic Party led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky was regarded by  many people as a threat posed by Russian fascism, says an  article published by the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. According to the  newspaper, the "Russia's Choice" bloc, having spent twice as  much as the Liberal Democratic Party and having bought much more  air time on television than the Russian Liberal Democratic  Party, has lost to Zhirinovsky the elections by party blocs and  managed to level the situation thanks to those constituencies  which cast ballots for individual candidates rather than for  party blocs."    "All this gives ground to believe that by doing so Russian  electors, in fact, have denied confidence to Russian President  Boris Yeltsin and the government which after the elections  becomes the government of the minority," the article says.  Acording to the article, millions of electors voted not for  fascism or fascists, but rather for clear-cut politics".    Forecasting the development of the situation in the new  Russian Parliament, the article says that "at present,  representatives of some parties and blocs renounced cooperation  with the Liberal Democratic Party which is "fraught with  distabilisation in parliament and sharp increase of the role and  powers of the president."    As for economic problems, the article says that neither of  political parties which won seats in parliament has a clear-cut  and comprehensive economic programme and one can say with  certainty that neither the state duma, nor the federation  council will deal with the economics now, leaving it for the  government to attend to."    The RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA daily carries an intreview with  ex-Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. Commenting on the  development of the economic situation in Russia, Gorbachev said  that nowadays, Russia needs politics uniting people rather than  splitting the country. As for the victory won in the elections  by the Liberal Democratic Party, Gorbachev described its leader,  Vladimir Zhirinovsky, as a splendid actor, adding that " it very  important to fund out who directs him and who backs him up."    "Undoubtedly, his capabilities were appreciated and will be  made use of in future, but I do not see the need for launching  an anti- fascist movement in Russia. Are we going to accuse of  fascism people who voted for Zhirinovsky? By the way, the  Constitution would not have been approved without these people's  votes," Gorbachev said.    An article published by the SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA today also  denies that there is a need to create the so-called  "anti-fascist front". The article says that the idea of creating  this front is obviously directed against "triumphant elections  held by the Liberal Democratic Party led by Zhirinovsky, and,  consequently, against the free will of electors which makes up  the basis of democracy."    The TRUD daily focuses on the results of 1993 discussed from  different points of view by prominent Russian philosopher  Alexander Tsipko and an economist and state duma deputy, Vasily  Selyunin. Tsipko pointed out that in 1993 he was disappointed in  what was going on in Russia, adding that "neither the truth, no  democracy and the market itself were any good to a Soviet man."    Selyunin expressed a different opinion, pointing out that in  1993, an end was put to dual power in Russia and the living  standards began to gradually improve which is seen from the fact  that the consumption of food has increased approximately by ten  per cent. "We have saved our economy which many former soviet  republics failed to do," Selyunin said.    The PRAVDA daily writes in its economic forecast for 1994  that the living standards of the population will further  decline. "In 1994, approximately 33 per cent of the Russian  people will have an average income per capita less than the  minimum subsistence level," the newspaper said.    The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper published the results of a  sociological poll. The majority of respondents believe that  life has stabilised and 13 per cent of respondents even said  that their life improved over the past year.</p>

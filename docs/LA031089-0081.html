			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: JOKES ABOUT 'THE GARV' SOUR PARTY FOR ATHLETES  </P> <P> It sounded like a swell idea: male and female athletes from high schools  throughout San Diego County honored at a fancy banquet, with professional  football players handing out the awards.  </P> <P> But jokes about Steve Garvey's paternity problems and other mildly suggestive  jibes by San Diego Charger Billy Ray Smith and former Chargers Kellen Winslow  and Hank Bauer left at least some of the parents and school officials  embarrassed and angry.  </P> <P> Among those who were upset were the father of a girl receiving an award for her  volleyball prowess and a San Diego high school principal who wishes she hadn't  been invited.  </P> <P> "The locker-room humor got going and they couldn't stop it," said John Deavers,  student government adviser at Poway High School. "That would be all right for a  Rotary or Kiwanis meeting but not for a banquet with teen-agers. These guys are  supposed to be role models."  </P> <P> Winslow asked a girl if she knew Garvey; Bauer wondered aloud how the male  coaches react to having "gorgeous" young girls on campus, and Smith said Garvey  should "lay off or cut it out."  </P> <P> Former television sportscaster Mike Smith, whose video company, Image  Producers, sponsored last week's banquet at the waterfront Marriott Hotel, says  he is sorry that people were upset. The objectionable stuff began when the  jocks departed from their prepared scripts and started to ad-lib.  </P> <P> "The comments were out of place, and I hope people know we had no control over  what the presenters would say," Smith said. "When we have something like this  again, we'll sit down and talk about what is acceptable for a high school  audience."  </P> <P> Bauer, a radio sportscaster, said he is "ticked off" that anyone could  interpret his comment as improper. He said he was merely trying to compliment  the girls on their looks.  </P> <P> Billy Ray Smith said his Garvey joke was a "feeble attempt at humor" and that  "I'll be the first to apologize if anyone was offended." But he added that the  adults should realize that the students are about to enter college, where they  will hear much stronger stuff.  </P> <P> Winslow did not return several messages left with his answering service.  </P> <P> </P> <P> One Pop and You're Out  </P> <P> School officials in San Marcos have taken a tough stand against the latest rage  on campus: small firecracker-like packages called "poppers," wrapped in tinfoil  and sold at swap meets and in Tijuana.  </P> <P> So far, 15 students have been expelled for possessing the illegal explosive  devices and will not be readmitted until next fall, at the earliest. (The  students are eligible to attend a county-run school for pupils with discipline  problems or apply to other school districts.)  </P> <P> San Marcos School Supt. Mac Bernd this week sent a note to all parents warning  that there will be zero tolerance for poppers.  </P> <P> The San Marcos response contrasts sharply with that of the San Diego school  system, where students caught with poppers merely have them confiscated and are  asked not to bring any more to campus, according to security chief Alex Rascon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Street-Smart Scalpers  </P> <P> Tickets for Neil Diamond's April 17 concert at the Sports Arena sold out within  two hours, but somehow, as always, the scalpers and brokers have plenty of  tickets to sell, at a tidy profit.  </P> <P> Two ticket hustlers hired 20-odd street people to sleep near the box office at  the downtown Civic Theatre to be ready when sales began at 10 a.m. Monday. One  of the two passed out cookies and sang off-key renditions of Diamond songs to  keep the recruits focused on the task.  </P> <P> As each street person approached the head of the line, he was slipped enough  money for six tickets (the maximum allowed) at $20 each, plus a couple of bucks  for his effort. Some were unsteady on their feet, others had the bruised faces  that come with urban outdoor living.  </P> <P> "One was so drunk he could barely stand," said one box-office employee, adding  that she has seen nothing like the transients-as-proxies scheme in her 12  years. Usually, the scalpers and brokers hire college kids, she said.  </P></p>

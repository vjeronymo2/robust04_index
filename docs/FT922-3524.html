			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / People: Amec's house of cards Malcolm Hawe, architect of Amec's rapid expansion into housebuilding and the company's biggest individual shareholder, has resigned as chairman of the company's loss-making housing and property business. The departure of 53-year-old Hawe comes a couple of months after Amec itself reported a loss as a result of a need to take a Pounds 60m exceptional provision against its land and property values. In common with many construction companies Amec, had increased its exposure to property and housebuilding just at the wrong time. Analysts suggested that his departure confirms that Amec intends to withdraw from the housing business. Hawe, a quantity surveyor, joined Amec in 1986 when the group joined forces with his housebuilding company to form Fairclough Homes. In 1989 he was appointed to the main board following the 'remarkably successful development' of Fairclough Homes. In addition to being rewarded with a boardroom seat, Hawe also emerged as a major shareholder because Amec issued paper to buy his company. At one stage he owned 6.85m Amec shares. However, he has been a steady seller of Amec stock and according to the last annual report his stake had fallen to 2m. John Early, Amec's 46-year-old finance director, is taking over Hawe's responsibilities and will continue to be responsible for directing Amec's strategic development throughout Europe and for overseeing the rationalisation of Amec's US activities. Simon Batey, Early's 39-year-old deputy, is taking over from Early as group finance director.</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / CBI warns on pay policy in public sector PUBLIC SECTOR pay policy will fail unless ministers focus on the size of the sector's total wage bill next year, rather than on the level of individual settlements, the Confederation of British Industry warned yesterday. The CBI will not recommend a ceiling for pay rises for next year until nearer this year's December Budget, but Mr Howard Davies, its director-general, said the figure was unlikely to be higher than the government's 1.5 per cent public-sector ceiling for the current year. Mr Davies said the government's approach to controlling pay was unsustainable and risked collapse if the economy improved. He said the approach could only work for a year, or perhaps two, before pay structure and relativity problems emerged. 'The government should start to look at the kind of disciplines the private sector has had to live with. While pay discipline is well under control at the moment, there is no reason to say it will not accelerate without changes in approach'. Mr Davies said public-sector pay policies were 'easier to start than to finish' and stressed that ministers must soon consider extending and revising pay restraint strategy if recent progress on pay was not to be sacrificed. The CBI's intervention reflects growing concern among pay experts that the line on pay will be hard to hold next year and that pay deals will try to catch up on earlier, low settlements. The organisation, which is enjoying renewed influence in Whitehall, is also stepping up efforts to maintain downward pressure on private-sector pay - year-on-year settlements in manufacturing are running at 3.1 per cent - and to curb unit labour costs. Mr Davies acknowledged that a total pay bill strategy in the public sector would be more difficult to implement but said it would prove more effective and more likely to resist upward pressures on pay levels. He said the Treasury was nervous about a switch in focus which would give more flexibility at local level. Leaders of the 49,000-strong Fire Brigades Union will today meet local authority employers and are expected to be told that they will receive a 1.5 per cent pay rise.</p>

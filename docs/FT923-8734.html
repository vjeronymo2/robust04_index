			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Brazilian protesters call for impeachment of Collor ABOUT 20,000 demonstrators gathered in the centre of Sao Paulo at the weekend to call for the impeachment of Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello, Reuter reports from Sao Paulo. They carried banners reading 'Impeachment Now' and 'Collor Out', in what was the first large demonstration against Mr Collor since a government scandal erupted in May. The president is fending off corruption charges after some of his top aides were accused of running an influence peddling ring, from which Mr Collor allegedly profited. The demonstration was led by Mr Luis Ignacio 'Lula' da Silva, head of the radical Workers' party (PT), one of the main opposition groups, Senator Eduardo Suplicy, also of the PT, members of other opposition parties and union heads.</p>

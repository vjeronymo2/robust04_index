"Russia adheres to the principle of dual citizenship, which  in recent years has become a reality," the commission's  proposals read. "To have it legally fixed, relevant bilateral  agreements must be concluded."    The commission claims that "dual citizenship doesn't  preclude  the formation of new states or violate their sovereignty," and  emphasizes that the proposed measures "are not aimed at  interference in the domestic affairs" of the Baltic states. The  Baltic states' legislation, however, does not provide for dual  citizenship.    According to the commission's proposals, Russia must also  strive for the preservation of Russian as "the language of  inter-ethnic communication" in the entire information space of  the former Soviet Union.    The commission said its proposals are due to the fact that  "hundreds of thousands of people in Latvia, Lithuania and  Estonia have been deprived of citizenship, which causes  infringement of their right to vote and the right to ownership,  and even puts in question their right to live in those  countries." The commission expressed concern that "disregard of  human rights may give rise to social and political conflicts."    "In recognizing the newly independent states formed on the  basis of former Soviet republics, Russia expected the  legislation of those countries to meet international legal  standards," the commission stated.    The Baltic states' policies stem from a different principle.  Having restored their independence after the 50-year occupation,  Latvia and Estonia reinstituted also the principle of hereditary  citizenship. Lithuania, whose territory underwent considerable  changes in the course of World War II, chose the so-called zero  option of citizenship, under which all persons residing in the  country are eligible for its citizenship.</p>

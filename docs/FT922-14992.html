			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: Sita sets up services company AN international air transport consortium is launching a commercial telecommunications services company to provide value-added network services to industries ranging from leisure to financial services. The Socie'te' Internationale de Te'le'communications Aeronautiques (Sita), a non-profit-making organisation of 460 member companies from the airline, aerospace and related industries, is investing about Dollars 20m over the next four to five years in Scitor, a wholly owned UK-based subsidiary. Scitor, which will provide services, such as reservation systems for hotels and sales systems for multinationals, aims for revenues of Dollars 100m by 1998. It has already won orders worth Dollars 40m from 250 companies including Hilton International and Budget Rent A Car. Value-added network services are the fastest growing sector of Europe's information services industry with revenues forecast to increase from Dollars 3.8bn last year to over Dollars 10bn in 1995, according to BIS Strategic Decisions, the market research company. PHILIPS, the Dutch electonics group, is launching Compact Disc Interactive (CD-I), a multi-media home entertainment system, in the UK earlier than planned in an effort to speed up the product's penetration of international markets. CD-I combines audio, video, text, animation and graphics on a compact disc. It is one of three products which Philips is counting on to boost its depressed consumer electronics business. The other two are digital compact disc, scheduled to be launched in the autumn and high definition TV. The Dutch group has invested a significant amount in developing CD-I and the software for the system which allows the user to manipulate the material on the televsion screen. The difficulty in marketing CD-I is that, unlike compact discs, which have easily recognisable advantages, CD-I is an entirely new concept so that Philips needs to educate consumers about its merits. The UK launch has been brought forward from September when it was initially scheduled to be introduced into EC markets.</p>

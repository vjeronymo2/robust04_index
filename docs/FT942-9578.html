			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: 3i takes off - New issues The flotation of 3i, the UK's largest venture capital supplier, as an investment trust is now firmly on the launch pad, writes Richard Gourlay. The group said a quarter of the shares it is selling in the planned summer flotation are likely to be made available for private investors. The high street banks and the Bank of England, which own 3i, are likely to sell only about a third of the equity for about Pounds 500m. Details are still scarce ahead of the publication of a pathfinder prospectus later this month and the public offer by the end of June. But the price is likely to be based on a discount to the net asset value due to be published with annual results later this month. The flotation will be not only the largest but one of the most interesting new issues available to private investors this year. 3i will provide one of the few ways for individuals to invest in a relatively liquid way in a well-diversified portfolio of unlisted companies. The group provides equity, debt and mezzanine finance to unquoted companies seeking expansion capital, funds for management buy-outs and buy-ins, and start-ups. Earlier this year, 3i also started managing and investing funds provided by other financial institutions. This will increasingly provide 3i with fees, raising its return on assets.                             *      *      * Investors are being offered another slice of London property. But the unusual feature of the intermediaries' offer for shares in CLS Holdings is that those interested can buy in at 15 per cent below the estimated value of the company, writes Simon Davies. CLS is a property investment concern with a 10-year track record. Run by the two Mortstedt brothers, who switched from Swedish to British properties early in the 1980s, it made an astute call on the market in 1989 and was able to gear up investment at lower prices last year. The company is offering 45.04m new shares at 111p, representing 46 per cent of the company, at a value of Pounds 50m. But a maximum of half of these shares are on offer through intermediaries. The shares offer a notional yield of 5.5 per cent at the issue price. Most of the company's properties are within the M25 and are forecast to provide net rental income of Pounds 25m in the present year. Pre-tax profits should reach Pounds 8m. The issue is sponsored by UBS and Apax partners and applications must be in by noon on May 23. Trading should start on May 27.</p>

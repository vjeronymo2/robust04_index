			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Text] Government Minister Arnoldo Ortiz Moscoso announced  this Wednesday that the security measures to be adopted on 30  January for the referendum do not include the presence of  security personnel inside voting centers.    The minister also condemned Tuesday night's attack in  Guatemala City, which included the use of so-called leaflet  bombs [bombas panfleteras]. Ortiz Moscoso said there are ways  to express opposition to the referendum without resorting to  violence.    The government minister explained that he was unable to give  further details on the overall security measures to be used on  30 January during the referendum.    [Begin recording] [Ortiz] Basically, we expect to carry out  very thorough, respectful, nonaggressive, but sufficiently  energetic security measures around the voting centers. The  objective is to see that people can cast their votes in total  confidence. Security inside the voting centers will be the  responsibility of officials appointed by the electoral tribunal.  There will be no armed military, national police, or finance  police personnel inside the voting centers. These measures have  worked before and have been acknowledged internationally.    [Unidentified reporter] [Question indistinct]?    [Ortiz] Yes, that is not our responsibility. To settle that  matter it is necessary to resort to the electoral law. A  summons was duly issued by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which  adopted it as a rule for those days. In other words, security  will be guaranteed 24 hours prior to the referendum and  throughout the day on which the voting is scheduled to take  place. As far as we are concerned [words indistinct].    [Reporter] [Question indistinct]?    [Ortiz] No, it is very difficult identify anyone in  particular. However, it is easy to infer that we are talking  about people or organizations intent on blocking the internal  pacification process. They are determined to prevent the  Guatemalan people from experimenting with a mechanism like the  referendum, which has never been used in Guatemala. The  authorities and the Government Ministry in particular believe  that the methods these groups are willing to use are not only  reprehensible but unjustified. As I told the media a fews days,  there is no sense in resorting to bombs, even it is was merely a  pamphlet bomb, to try to convince the population to vote for,  against, or not at all in the referendum. The media are  available to any group wishing to express their opposition in a  democratic manner. It really makes no sense. We could  understand it somewhat if there were restrictions on freedom of  expression. [Words indistinct] not only because freedom of  expression is guaranteed, but also because the media has their  own initiatives, which no one seeks to limit. The media can  interview anyone they wish. For these groups to resort to  methods such as these merely to frighten the people is  depressing and reprehensible. [end recording]</p>

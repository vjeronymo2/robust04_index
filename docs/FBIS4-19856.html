			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Norbert Lepszy article: "Incompetent, at Odds With Each </F> Other, and Ineffective Politically"]    [Text] How the Republikaner and the DVU [German People's  Union] behave in concrete practice, especially at the district,  land, and European levels, has not been examined in a thorough,  systematic and comparative manner until now. A first attempt  has been made by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. In December  1993, the foundation published its results in the form of a  study.    Although the DVU was included to provide a comprehensive  picture, the study focused on the Republikaner and their  activities in assemblies at the district, land, and European  levels. Whereas the DVU clearly falls into the right-wing  extremist category, cannot be taken seriously, and is  incompetent, the Republikaner merit more serious attention.  <H5>  Analysis </H5>   The Republikaner are a populist, radical right-wing party  with no clear dividing line separating them from right-wing  extremism, especially in those areas in which a hostility toward  foreigners, racism, and gut nationalism come to the fore in  party agitation and propaganda. The main question of the  research was to establish the Republikaner's political ability,  their "manner of conducting disputes," and substantive and  personnel competence in parliament. It was self-evident that  consideration would be given to the three land parliaments to  which radical right-wing and right-wing extremist parties had  been elected -- Bremen, Schleswig-Holstein (DVU), and  Baden-Wuerttemberg -- as well as the European Parliament  (Republikaner). In selecting towns and districts, the following  criteria were considered: the Republikaner share of the vote,  achieving a regional balance, and a comparison of town and  country.    On the basis of these considerations, the following areas  were chosen: the city of Hannover, the district of Hannover,  Duesseldorf, Cologne, the district of Rheingau-Taunus,  Heidenheim, Pforzheim, Augsburg, and Rosenheim. In only a few  isolated cases were other examples -- mostly similar and  parallel cases -- considered. In those towns and districts,  numerous conversations were conducted with representatives of  parties and journalists, extensive material connected with  parliamentary work was examined and collected, and the local  press was assessed.    The survey of the Republikaner in district and municipal  assemblies revealed the party's weaknesses at that level.  Internal party organizational structures -- although they may  differ from region to region -- have been barely developed. In  quite a number of districts, they were to unable to take up the  seats they had obtained, because of a severe lack of candidates.  The elected representatives, some of whom have a right-wing  extremist past, mainly lack political experience or competence  in local politics. The focus of their work -- with some  exceptions -- is not on dealing intensively with difficult local  issues, but on constantly propagating the general populist  slogans, prejudices, and affectations that make up Republikaner  ideology.  <H5>  Issues Concerning Foreigners </H5>   The Republikaner are not a local level party from the point  of view of the way in which they were formed and their key  national, programmatic policies. Until now, they have not  possessed fixed local policy concepts, but have only propagated  stances on individual issues in their strongholds. However,  those often fail to be linked to programmatic ideas at the  federal level. The greatest exception is the only element that  holds the Republikaner together: the question of foreigners and  asylum. It is a cause and catalyst that runs like a thread  through all policy levels -- from local policy to European  policy -- in the desperate effort to link it to all political  problems. So far, the party has not developed a stance of its  own at the local level and the accompanying ability to deal with  and solve matters in any particular policy area or field or even  with regard to individual problems. In most of the towns and  districts that were examined, the work of Republikaner groups  clearly concentrated on policy on foreigners and asylum, whereas  the classic topics of local politics were secondary as a result  of a lack of competence.  <H5>  Propaganda </H5>   Thus, at all levels of representation, most Republikaner  groupings have remained a "single issue party." That also  applies to the Baden-Wuerttemberg Landtag, in which the  Republikaner have held 15 seats since April 1992. In many  assembles, they operate according to the same simple pattern:  Almost all issues on which they have expressed a view are in  some way -- indirectly or often polemically -- connected with  the question of foreigners and asylum. Their patent solution for  all problems, extending from economic and social policy to  policy on the environment, policy on political and economic  systems, is to seal off Germany from foreigners. In the case of  the Republikaner, all policy ends up in the blind alley of  nationalist isolation.    This concentration on policy on foreigners and asylum is  particularly evident in agitation and propaganda at the  "grass-roots level," that is, in direct appeals to the  population. The Republikaner agitation and propaganda work is  inseparably linked to their work in parliament. To a large  extent, those who work as party agitators are the same people  who are represented in parliament. Frequently, particularly  polemical group motions or questions are circulated as pamphlets  for propaganda in the streets. These examples show that the  Republikaner, despite their repeated efforts to achieve  recognition from the "established" parties and democratic  respectability, do not shrink from the defamation of their  political opponents and minority groups and the oblique  spreading of fear and aggression. That is why at the local  level, they already rule themselves out for any form of  cooperation.    There have repeatedly been disputes among Republikaner and  DVU groupings at various levels of representation. Internal  quarrels, disputes, and disagreements often determine the image  of radical right-wing and right-wing extremist parties.  According to a study conducted by the Southwest Radio, of the  136 Republikaner groups in assemblies, 63 have either completely  or partially fallen apart, and of the 402 office holders at the  district level, only 289 remain. These findings were completely  confirmed by what the Konrad Adenauer Foundation found in  numerous towns and districts (for example, Duesseldorf, Cologne,  Pforzheim, and Augsburg), at the land level (Bremen and  Schleswig-Holstein), and especially in the European Parliament.  There, Franz Schoenhuber is the only remaining Republikaner (of  the original six), but as a deputy without a group. Like his  former colleagues in the "Technical Group of the European  Right," Schoenhuber frequently shines in concrete parliamentary  work, especially commission work, by virtue of his absence.  <H5>  No Dialogue </H5>   The radical right-wing, right-wing extremist parties still  lack a firm base in society. There is hardly any contact, let  alone dialogue, between parties and voters. Parties and groups  maintain few contacts with social groups and associations.  Contacts with the administration, which are so important for  local-level political work, are underdeveloped. The  shortcomings do not help make up for the lack of experience and  knowledge and insufficient competence on the part of elected  representatives.    The conclusion is that those who vote for parties such as  the  Republikaner or the DVU cannot count on personnel continuity and  organizational stability in those parties and groups. The voter  does not opt for a specific political program or even a minimum  ability to solve problems. Right-wing extremist and radical  right-wing parties are still unable to act effectively and  pursue politics under conditions of parliamentary democracy.</p>

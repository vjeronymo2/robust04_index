			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRANK LAUSCHE; OHIO GOVERNOR, SENATOR  </P> <P> Frank J. Lausche, the son of Slovakian immigrants who emerged from the ethnic  neighborhoods of Cleveland to become a dominant and durable figure on the  political scene for 40 years, died Saturday.  </P> <P> The conservative Democrat who served as a judge and mayor in his native city  before becoming a five-term Ohio governor and two-term U.S. senator was 94.  </P> <P> He died at the Slovene Home for the Aged in Cleveland where he had been  admitted two months ago, said his sister-in-law, Antonia Lausche.  </P> <P> One of 10 children of a steel worker father who died when he was only 13, young  Lausche earned his first pennies lighting gas street lamps and acting as a  court interpreter for his fellow Slovenians who came from a land now part of  Yugoslavia.  </P> <P> He studied for a career in law, received a degree in 1920 from John Marshall  School of Law -- where he ranked second in his class -- and quickly became  known as one of Cleveland's better trial lawyers.  </P> <P> Lausche's courtroom popularity encouraged him to make his first political race,  an unsuccessful bid for the Ohio House in 1922 and then a second losing  campaign for the Ohio Senate two years later.  </P> <P> In 1932 he was appointed judge of the Cleveland Municipal Court and in 1941  became mayor of that city, a position he held until his election in 1944 to the  first of five terms as governor.  </P> <P> He was the only governor in Ohio's history to be elected that many times.  </P> <P> As mayor he was credited with establishing Cleveland's city-owned transit  system and setting up committees that dealt with labor, health, transportation  and Cleveland's growing racial problems.  </P> <P> Although a Democrat, Lausche earned a reputation as an independent who often  ignored party positions and consistently proved popular among independents and  Republican voters.  </P> <P> He was called a "sturdy independent" who favored right-to-work legislation and  sponsored a $336-million turnpike across Ohio while creating a resources  department that directed the planting of 27 million trees.  </P> <P> Faced with a new Ohio law that prevented any governor from serving more than  two successive terms, Lausche turned to the U.S. Senate where he was elected in  1956 and reelected in 1962.  </P> <P> He served on the Senate Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee, the Foreign  Relations Committee and as chairman of the Far Eastern Affairs subcommittee of  the Foreign Relations Committee.  </P> <P> Lausche's lengthy political career ended in 1968 with his defeat -- due mostly  to a long-running feud with organized labor -- in the Democratic primary for  reelection to a third term in the Senate.  </P> <P> "He had a beautiful, wonderful life. We're sorry he didn't live long enough to  see Slovenia become an independent country," said his sister-in-law. "They're  part of Yugoslavia right now, but they're fighting for independence."  </P> <P> Lausche is survived by a sister, Josephine Lausche Welf, 95, who also lives at  the Slovene Home, and three sisters-in-law. His wife, Jane, died in 1981.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Improvisations by the President's </F> Press Secretary"]    [Text] At a briefing held yesterday at the Kremlin,  Vyacheslav Kostikov, the president of the Russian Federation's  press secretary, remarked that--as a result of the publication  by NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA of an item concerning the imminent  resignation of Sergey Filatov, administrative chief of the  president of the Russian Federation--an "impression has been  created that NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA lacks genuine sources of  information and is, therefore, engaging in improvisation.  "Filatov was, is, and will remain in a test period as one of the  president's closest staff associates, and there can be no talk  of his resignation," said Mr. Kostikov, as reported by the  POSTFACTUM news agency. Let us merely note that the information  concerning Filatov's resignation as a matter which has already  been decided was reported to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA by persons  whose names we do not wish to publish. But allow us to assure  our readers and the president's press secretary himself that--by  their rank within the presidential hierarchy--they are higher  than Mr. Kostikov and, therefore, better informed than he is.</p>

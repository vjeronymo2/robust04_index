			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporters Lo Ping (5012 0393) and Li Tzu-ching </F> (7812 5261 0079): "Deng and Chen Have a Secret Talk in  Hangzhou"]    [Text] Have you ever heard of any person with three eyes,  except for the one in the "Tales of Chinese Gods and Deities"?    "Yes, I have," said a writer in Beijing in a satiric tone.  Nowadays, some people have three eyes, with one eye looking at  money, another looking at Deng, and the other looking at Chen.    The reason Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun have become the focus  of attention is that the contradictions between them always have  a great influence on the general situation. Another reason is  that if one of them dies, the general situation will be more  greatly affected. People believe both will greatly affect the  money they have earned and the way they are earning their money.    Thee two heads, who rarely meet, recently met in Hangzhou,  but the meeting has been kept secret; only a small circle of top  leaders have been informed.  <H3>  Wan Li, Bo Yibo, and Yang Dezhong Were Present at the  Deng-Chen Meeting </H3>   Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun had their meeting on 8 January.  They usually meet once or twice every year. This was proposed  by the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee  in early November 1989 after Deng resigned his post as chairman  of the Central Military Commission. They usually have their  meetings in Shanghai or Hangzhou. After arriving in Hangzhou by  special train on 8 January and having talks with Chen Yun, Deng  Xiaoping returned to Shanghai on 10 January. Wan Li, Bo Yibo,  and Yang Dezhong were present at the Deng-Chen meeting.    On 13 January, Wu Bangguo, member of the Political Bureau of  the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the Shanghai  Municipal CPC Committee, conveyed the spirit of the Deng-Chen  meeting at a meeting of the standing committee of the municipal  CPC committee, in accordance with a document issued by the  Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee entitled "The Common  Views and Proposals of Comrades Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun on  the Current Internal and External Situations."  <H3>  "The People's Bearing Capacity Should Not Be Neglected When  Working Out Measures for Economic Reform" </H3>   Wu Bangguo said: During their recent meeting, Comrades Deng  Xiaoping and Chen Yun discussed the current internal and  external situations, especially the internal situation, each  giving his views. They held basically identical views on a  series of issues. Both held that it is necessary to make a full  appraisal of the people's bearing capacity so that it is not  neglected when working out measures for economic reform; that it  is necessary to regard strengthening party building as a very  important task at present and to attach great importance to  political and ideological work (to which less attention has been  paid); that it is necessary to continue carrying out the work of  opposing corruption, encouraging the honest performance of  official duties, and removing obstacles; that, in light of the  fact that such poisonous influences as money worship and the  mentality of putting money first, are seriously affecting the  people's thinking and socialist morality, the leading cadres  must set a good example for the people and learn what the  grass-roots cadres and common people are thinking, what they  want to resolve, and what they have the greatest complaints  about; that social and political stability will continue to be  crucial matters for the next five to 10 years; and that the  sovereignty and security of the state should be put first at all  times.    Both the document of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat  and the relayed report by Wu Bangguo said Deng and Chen had  "basically identical views" on some issues, but not "entirely  identical views." On what issues did they hold "basically  nonidentical views" then? They said nothing about this, but Bo  Yibo disclosed it.    At a forum of retired veteran cadres on 13 January, Bo Yibo  disclosed the differences between Deng and Chen during their  meeting.  <H5>  Bo Yibo Discloses Differences Between Deng and Chen </H5>   Bo Yibo said: Comrade Xiaoping and Revered Comrade Chen  [xiao ping tong zhi he chen lao 1420 1627 0681 1807 0735 7115  5071] had a meeting. They talked for about two hours and had  lunch together. Their talks at the luncheon were also about the  current situation. Deng Xiaoping stressed that reform and  development should not stop and that people should have no  doubts about the correctness of the policy simply because some  problems had emerged. The problem is that the central and  provincial leading bodies must remain clear-headed. The pace of  development should not slow down, or China will lag behind. At  present, the leaders should further emancipate their minds.  They must rid their brains of the word "fear," and shake off  the trammels of book worship within the party. Xiaoping said  that some problems do exist among some local leading cadres,  such as local departmentalism and local sectarianism. The main  reason is that they do not fully understand and comprehend the  spirit of the central authorities' line, policies, and  principles.  <H5>  Chen Yun's Five Criticisms Against Deng </H5>   Bo Yibo continued: Our revered Comrade Chen stressed the  necessity of absolute steadiness, saying that it would be a  miracle if a healthy economic growth rate of seven percent could  be preserved. At present, it is necessary to sum up some major  and common problems in reform and opening up, and to study and  resolve them one by one. He pointed out that in the current  stage, conviction, morality, and style within the party are the  crucial problems of the whole party and nation. Local  departmentalism and local sectarianism, which exist to a serious  extent throughout the country, have weakened the leadership and  authority of the central authorities. Our revered Comrade Chen  also pointed out that emancipation of the mind does not mean  advocating and publicizing the spirit of "forcing a way forward"  in disregard of our national conditions, the scientific spirit  of seeking truth from facts. or laws, systems, and discipline.  He pointed out that China should try to put an end to the  passive state in Sino-U.S. trade and overcome right-opportunism  in its U.S. policy. It should draw lessons from the fact that  Britain has flatly violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration  and the agreements reached between the two governments; China  should adopt more resolute measures, including new decisions.    In fact, Chen Yun was criticizing Deng Xiaoping in the  following five fields: First, unsteadiness in reform; second,  excessive economic growth; third, no summary of work; fourth,  "three violations" in the practice of emancipating the mind  advocated by Deng, that is, disregarding national conditions,  scientific spirit, and laws and systems; and fifth, right  deviation toward the United States.  <H5>  Chen Yun: "Once Leftism Is Criticized, Rightism Appears" </H5>   Moreover, on another occasion, Chen Yun pointed out that  rightism had appeared after "criticizing leftism," and  sometimes, the criticism of leftism was wrong.    During a meeting with Li Lanqing at the beginning of  January,  Chen Yun said: In our work today, it is particularly necessary  to pay attention to social stability and remaining cool-headed.  I still want to pour some cold water on hotheadedness. There  will be trouble if turbulence is aroused because of our improper  policies and measures and because of continuous infiltration,  subversion, and propaganda by the United States. He also  pointed out: It is necessary to exercise control over commodity  prices and inflation, and to continue to do a good job in  opposing corruption and building a clean government. It is  necessary to carry out necessary political study and moral  education. "What I am really worrying about is the practice of  stressing one tendency to the neglect of another, such as  stressing criticism of leftism to the neglect of the emergence  of rightism. Sometimes certain correct practices are criticized  and abandoned as expressions of the leftist tendency; this is a  dangerous trend. I often remind some comrades among the central  authorities that the phenomenon of one tendency concealing  another has often appeared in the party's policies and practical  work, but we have failed to draw lessons from it."    During his meeting with Chen Yun, Deng Xiaoping stressed the  necessity of "shaking off the trammels of book worship within  the party." Did he refer to the trend of book worship in Chen  Yun? One point is clear, that is, Chen Yun believed that Deng  Xiaoping was not entirely correct in "criticizing leftism" (in  fact, Deng only proposed to "prevent leftism"), because by  "criticizing leftism," "rightism" had been encouraged. We can  be sure of this. Another point we are sure of is that the  differences between Deng and Chen are differences in principle.  It seems that their contradictions are unsolvable.</p>

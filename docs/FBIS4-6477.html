			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- More than 70 members  of 20 organisations under the "Kanto Council of the Great Japan  Patriots Union", a rightwing organisation in Japan, on April 19  kicked up a row against the General Association of Korean  Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) in front of the Korean hall where  the central headquarters of Chongnyon is housed, and the Tokyo  head office of the Korean Bank and the Tonghae Trading Company,  Ltd., according to a KNS report from Tokyo.    The rightwing gangsters riding in 30 loudspeaker cars  committed rowdyism, letting loose an ugly torrent of words such  as "Chongnyon, get out of Japan" and "North Korea, immediately  stop nuclear threat to Japan".    This provocation came at a time when the Japanese  reactionary  authorities were zealously joining the U.S. imperialists and the  South Korean puppet clique in the anti-DPRK nuclear rackets. It  can never be considered to be an accidental or isolated incident.    Chongnyon and the Korean residents in Japan are sternly  denouncing this exceptional provocation, regarding it as an  offspring of the Japanese authorities' hostile policy toward the  DPRK and the anti-Chongnyon moves, not a self-determined act of  rightwing gangsters.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that his remarks  on the evacuation of settlements on the Golan Heights in  exchange for peace also expressed his position in general with  regard to Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. The prime  minister spoke after leaving a convention of the Shinuy  [Democratic Movement for Change] movement, in which he also  noted that the reports he received from Bucharest and Cairo  indicate progress in the negotiations with the Palestinians.  Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports:    [Begin recording] [Nir] The prime minister said that the  reports he received yesterday from Foreign Minister Peres in  Bucharest and Major General Amnon Shahaq in Cairo indicate  progress. He does not know whether concluding the negotiations  will take one, two, or five weeks; however, he said, we are  moving closer to the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First  agreement.    Rabin said his position with regard to the evacuation of  settlements on the Golan Heights in exchange for peace also  reflects his position in general with regard to Judaea, Samaria,  and the Gaza Strip. Rabin asserted that his statements are  unconnected to the negotiations with Syria; however, when  referring to the Golan Heights, Rabin used the term Syrian soil.    [Rabin] I was asked a question on the issue of evacuating  settlements. I replied that we would not move settlements out  of security considerations -- not in the Gaza Strip, not in  Judaea and Samaria, and not on the Golan Heights. For peace,  however, we will be prepared to evacuate settlements. There is  a precedent for this: We evacuated all the settlements from the  Sinai Peninsula and we tore down Yamit. I believe that these  actions were justified at the time, and there is no reason not  to do the same today. At the beginning of my remarks, I  reiterated that our main struggle in the negotiations with Syria  is how to avoid repeating the same price we paid for peace with  Egypt -- in other words, to avoid having to implement a full  withdrawal from every square inch of Syrian soil we conquered  and having to uproot every vestige of Israeli presence in the  territory conquered from Syria.    [Nir] Rabin was asked whether there was any connection  between the timing of his announcement and the negotiations with  Syria.    [Rabin] If you read interviews with me that were conducted  in the past, you will see that I said that although I would not  evacuate settlements for security, I would evacuate them in  exchange for peace. Yesterday, I replied to a question on the  issue of settlement evacuation which a Golan Heights settler  happened to ask. My reply reflected my general position with  regard to the Gaza Strip, Judaea and Samaria, and the Golan  Heights.    [Nir] Rabin was speaking upon leaving a convention of Shinuy  veterans marking the movement's 20th anniversary. [end  recording]</p>

			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: ONE PLAY GAVE NEW YORK 2 HITS  </P> <P> An event that led to sports and theater history took place 69 years ago today.  </P> <P> On Jan. 3, 1920, Harry Frazee, owner of the Boston Red Sox, sold  pitcher-outfielder Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees for $125,000 plus a  $350,000 loan.  </P> <P> Everyone knows that Ruth became the most legendary baseball player of all-time  and turned the Yankees into the game's most successful franchise.  </P> <P> What a lot of people don't know is that Frazee used the loan to turn the play  "No, No, Nanette" into a hit on Broadway.  </P> <P> There has been plenty written and said about several Soviet hockey and  basketball stars coming to play in the United States and Canada, but according  to James H. Jackson of the Baltimore Sun, defenseman Kevin Lowe of the Edmonton  Oilers wouldn't mind playing in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "It would be one heck of an experience to be the first athlete from North  America to play over there," Lowe said. "It's not a gimmick. I'd like to go out  of curiosity of their politics, their society, their life style.  </P> <P> "I've heard people say I'm crazy. I think it would be an 8-to-10 month  commitment out of my life, but I've made a lot of commitments to the game to be  the best player I possibly could be. I wouldn't want to be at the end of my  career when I did it. I'd want to be competitive."  </P> <P> The Miami Heat lost the first 17 games of its first season before beating the  Clippers, but things began looking up last week when it won two straight.  </P> <P> Said forward Pat Cummings: "We started to walk with our first two wins -- now  we're starting to ride our bicycle."  </P> <P> Add Heat: During the exhibition season, Miami forward Scott Hastings said to a  trainer for his former team, the Atlanta Hawks: "I'm scared. I think I'm the  best player here."  </P> <P> Hastings was slightly off. He's last on the Heat with a 3.8-scoring average.  </P> <P> Last add Heat: Despite the team's nickname and locale, the Heat is cold. No  Miami player is shooting 50% from the field and the team average is 43.3%.  </P> <P> Coach Bill Walsh of the San Francisco 49ers called one of the National Football  League's rarely used plays when he had Mike Cofer try a free kick on the last  play of the first half in Sunday's 34-9 playoff victory over the Minnesota  Vikings.  </P> <P> The kick was set up when Walsh had John Taylor call for a fair catch at  midfield on a Minnesota punt. Cofer then missed badly on a field-goal attempt  from there.  </P> <P> "I've always wanted as a coach to try that," Walsh told reporters with a smile.  "It was sort of fun -- until we kicked it and then everybody ran in."  </P> <P> Quotebook  </P> <P> Coach Mike Ditka of the Chicago Bears, responding when asked if his next heart  attack might come on the sidelines: "I'm going to make it. And if I don't then  I'll tell you what, it's going to be earth-shattering, with the coach dying on  the sideline."  </P></p>

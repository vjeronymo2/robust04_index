			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Voters tuned in - Ballot Box Here, perhaps, is one of the biggest electoral surprises. Voters are far from bored by the television coverage and are not switching off. The newly available Broadcasting Audience Research Bureau (BARB) figures for the first full week of the campaign show modestly increased audiences for some news bulletins, while current-affairs programmes are holding on to respectable audiences. The biggest increases are for news bulletins at lunch and teatime. The BBC's One O'Clock News had an average audience of 4.3m, compared with the 1991 average of 3.8m. ITN's 12.30 news held steady at 2.4m. The BBC's Six O'Clock News was marginally up - 7.6m versus 7.4m  - but ITN's News at 5.40 rose from a 5.6m average to 6.2m. Viewers' patience for politics, however, seems to flag as the evening wears on. The BBC's Nine O'Clock News - very much the flagship  - is down from 7.2m last year to 6.4m, and ITN News at Ten is down significantly more - from 6.7m to 5.3m. Newsnight and Channel 4 are holding their own around the 1m mark. In the battle between the BBC and ITV, it looks at present like a hung BARB, with the BBC perhaps slightly in front.</p>

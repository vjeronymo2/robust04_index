The agreement, reached at a  joint government-party meeting held on Tuesday, is considered a  change from Seoul's policy against imports of Japanese culture,  especially music and films.    Culture and Sports Minister Yi Min-sop represented the  government at the joint meeting, while Rep. Paek Nam-chi spoke  for the party in his capacity as chief policy coordinator.  Emerging from the meeting, Paek said President Kim Yong-sam  would not say anything about opening the arts market to Japan  during his summit with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Tokyo  next month. Opening the arts market to Japan is not a matter of  consideration in view of the national sentiment against the  Japanese today, he added.    "But we've agreed that the nation should make all necessary  preparations for the inflow of Japanese arts to ride the  internationalization and market opening trends," he said.    The government and the ruling party also agreed to demolish  the former Japanese colonial government building in Seoul as  scheduled, though this has drawn both praise and criticism from  the public.</p>

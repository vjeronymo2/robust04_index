			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Pension scheme attacks compensation proposal: Electricity fund threatens to quit trade body THE UK's second biggest pension fund, the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme, has threatened to resign from the National Association of Pension Funds. The fund vigorously disapproves of the trade association's support for a compulsory compensation scheme for occupational pension funds. In a strongly worded letter to NAPF, Mr Mike Cannan, chief executive of the electricity scheme, said: 'There is widespread dismay that the NAPF would appear to have problems in identifying whose interests it should be representing. This issue has, in our view, greatly undermined the standing of the NAPF.' Mr Cannan said that, if the proposals were not withdrawn, the association's council should propose a motion of confidence at the next annual general meeting to prove its support among the membership. The 25-strong council is elected from the membership of the association, a voluntary body which represents the UK pensions industry. The dispute follows the establishment of the government's Pension Law Review Committee, chaired by Professor Roy Goode, after frauds committed by the late Mr Robert Maxwell came to light. The Goode committee sent out a questionnaire in September with 81 detailed questions for the pensions industry, and invited responses by December 15. The association prepared its own response, and sent it to members to gauge their reactions. It is the association's proposal for a compulsory compensation scheme which has angered the electricity fund, which has Pounds 10bn in assets and covers employees of the power generation and distribution industry. The association wants the pensions industry to pay compensation to fund members however a shortfall in an individual pension fund occurred. In his letter, Mr Cannan argued: 'To propound a view that the compensation scheme should meet a shortfall in pension benefits irrespective of the reason for that shortfall, and for the cost of any shortfall to be met by levies on occupational schemes is fundamentally flawed from an employer/trustee viewpoint.' The electricity scheme wants any pension compensation scheme to be funded by a combination of professional indemnity insurance, the existing Investors' Compensation Scheme (run under the Financial Services Act) and the government. The liability of occupational pension schemes would be strictly limited. Mr Mike Brown, director of information services at the association, said it was considering members' responses. 'There is a lot of support for the view that there should be a compensation scheme, but some members do not want to go as far as the council,' he said. Pensions charter group launched, Page 8</p>

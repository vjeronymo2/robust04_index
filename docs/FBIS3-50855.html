			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Magnolia Ruiz from the "TV Today" newscast] </F>   [Text] Attention, we have a last minute report. Today in  Juanchaco on the Pacific Coast, one of the gringo Marines who  arrived to build a little school said in a statement for the "TV  Today" newscast that this territory in Malaga Bay belongs to  them; in other words, that it is U.S. territory.    The 150 U.S. Southern Command soldiers are supposedly here  to  build a little school and a health center. Today, whatever the  reason for their arrival, it is not the most important issue.  Now the presence of the gringos has prompted various serious  opinions that have divided island residents. Some strongly  reject it, while others believe they should be given the  opportunity to show their generous, unselfish intentions so  people can trust them. Still others defend them by saying that  at last good luck has come to Juanchaco to bring progress to the  island.    [Begin recording] [Ruiz] Are you happy with the arrival of  the gringo soldiers?    [Unidentified woman] Yes, I am happy, because they are here  to help the people.    [Ruiz] How do they treat you?    [Woman] Very well. [end recording]    While area residents are trying to decide their position and  focus on the benefits the gringos will bring for the children in  education and health, the U.S. Marines know very well what they  are doing. As sure of themselves as Peter in his own house,  they transported a large amount of material by trucks down bumpy  Juanchaco roads and began working.    In addition, today they decided that they definitely need an  area in Colombian territory that belongs to them. The only  requirement that could be added to the existing restrictions  upon entering that territory would be asking Colombians to show  a passport in their own country.    [Begin unidentified Colombian soldier recording] The area  over there is not ours, it is their camp [words indistinct].  [end recording]    This spot where a Colombian Infantry marine is posted marks  the limits between Colombia and U.S. territory that have been  traced, limiting access to the media.</p>

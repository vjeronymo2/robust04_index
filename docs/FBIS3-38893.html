			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Renato Caprile report: "End of High-Risk Mission"] </F>   [Text] Rome -- It has certainly been no picnic. This can  be testified by the blood spilled so far: 10 deaths and some 40  wounded. However, the worst could be around the corner. The  final weeks of the Italian mission in Somalia promise to be very  risky indeed.    [Senate Speaker] Spadolini has understood this and has asked  for a rapid end to a match that started off badly, "without any  particular willingness on our part," and got worse, "involving a  diplomatic relationship -- including the United Nations -- that  was always tense and painful." For some time now Defense  Minister Fabbri has been echoing these sentiments. Some  objective consideration is called for, independently of the fact  that the day before yesterday 29-year-old Giulio Ruzzi lost his  life there: Operation Restore Hope has not untied any of the  knots in the Somalia crisis.    According to a report from the UN security forces, General  Aidid is actually planning a major attack against the UN troops  once the Westerners have left. His main enemy, Ali Mahdi -- the  interim president whose men control the area around Balad --  would like to get back the hundreds of pounds of old guns that  were seized from him by the Italians, since he is convinced that  after 31 March he will have to defend himself -- with arms --  against his eternal enemies.    General Carmine Fiore, the commander of Ibis 2 confirmed  from  Balad that the danger was real.    "I have a problem admitting," he said on the telephone,  "that  the days between now and 31 March could be tough days." Indeed,  this was predicted. Nevertheless, we were not expecting an  attack of the kind which took place Sunday [6 February] and  which cost the life of one of our men, but we did know that it  would be tough. With the Somalis you must always be on your  guard.    [Caprile] General, why this ambush along the Imperial Road?    [Fiore] I have been given an explanation. A dozen families  all belonging to the same clan -- the Abgal, which is also Ali  Mahdi's clan -- live in that area. Recently, a district  commissioner (a sort of governor -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note)  was elected who appears to be favoring those in his family a bit  too much. So where do we come in? Some people got it into  their heads that we have sided with that man. That is why they  shot at us on Sunday.    [Caprile] What do you intend to do now?    [Fiore] I have convened the heads of these families for a  meeting tomorrow: I want to make it clear once and for all  where things stand. I hope to succeed. But I repeat: With the  Somalis you can never tell.    [Caprile] What will happen in Somalia once you have left?    [Fiore] If I had been asked that question a week ago I would  have been able to give an optimistic reply. Now, I am decidedly  pessimistic. I am not saying that things will end up badly, but  I fail to see -- no matter how you look at it -- how things can  be put back together. It is nothing more than a squalid  struggle for power.    [Caprile] How is the morale among the troops?    [Fiore] Great, despite everything. They are well-trained men  who are used to this kind of stress. [Fiore interview ends]    From Fiore we move on to Bruno Loi, the former Italian  commander in Somalia, who was often targeted by Butrus-Ghali for  his "attempts" to find a political solution to the Somalia  puzzle. He has made a list of all the mistakes,  underestimations, and omissions that can be blamed on the United  Nations in the management of Operation Restore Hope. According  to the commander of the Lightning Force, the most serious  mistake was "believing, in bad faith, that the Italians cheated  and that they wanted to increase their prestige for who knows  what purpose."    According to the general, the fact that someone at UN  Headquarters thought that the Italians were "stacking the deck"  was a "mistake" caused by jealousy about our successes, as well  as by the need to maintain specific interests in the region.  The list of UN gaffes, which is signed by Loi, begins with the  fact that "it did not believe in the mediation capability of  Italy, which has had a presence in that area for about a  century." Another disastrous decision was to occupy only the  southern part of the country, thus allowing the warlords to  continue increasing their war arsenals in the center and north.    According to Loi, the mission command is also responsible  for  "failing to fully exploit the element of surprise to disarm  armed gangs." Initially, too much credit was given to General  Aidid, thus failing to comply with the requirement of  impartiality. The same Aidid was then "excessively demonized,"  when it became clear that he could not be a reliable ally.  According to Loi, when the decision was made to carry out  reprisals for the damage done by his militia, Aidid's political  image was blurred and the "wildly delivered blows" against him  ensured that he was reassessed as a genuine hero.    Other UN mistakes denounced by Loi were: believing that only  the leaders of the political factions were reliable  interlocutors; failing to take account of the fact that the  model of democracy proposed to the Somalis was in the Western  mold and could therefore cannot be exported to that environment;  and the fact that no provisions were made for the country's  economic reconstruction. Loi also accused the United Nations of  creating an excessively bureaucratic military command and of  putting together contingents that were too different and  therefore unmanageable.    One final mistake was the reprisal for the massacre of the  Pakistanis in June 1993. "We have never been against the use of  force, but between a slap in the face and the atomic bomb there  are a great many intermediate degrees of force that could be  used effectively."</p>

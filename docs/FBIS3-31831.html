			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Slobodan Jankovic from Pale] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] A meeting of the Commission  for Cooperation with the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] began  at Sarajevo Airport at 1100. Nikola Koljevic, vice president of  the Srpska republic, set off to the meeting armed with several  proposals regarding the opening of Sarajevo and the  normalization of life in both parts of the city. The proposals  in question concern the so-called blue roads leading toward  Sarajevo, which would be controlled by the peace forces, and the  free departure of civilians from the city, primarily Serbs who  since the beginning of the war have been hostages of the Muslim  authorities. The outcome of this meeting is awaited impatiently,  and it will depend to a great extent on the Muslim side's  position.</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WEEMS ERA AT HARBOR OPENS WITH 26-6 WIN  </P> <P> Harbor College opened its football season with an impressive 26-6 victory over  Victor Valley in Coach Don Weems' debut.  </P> <P> The Seahawks, starting a mostly freshman lineup, took a 7-0 first-quarter lead  when Casey Causey returned an interception 18 yards for the score.  </P> <P> The run-oriented Harbor offense, efficiently guided by quarterback Christian  Capper, got untracked in the second quarter. Bill Harris, who had a 101-yard  kickoff return nullified by a penalty, capped a drive with a six-yard scoring  run. Later in the quarter, Camron Pitcher broke away on a 40-yard scoring run.  With kicker Jose Rocha adding two points-after, Harbor took a 20-0 lead at  halftime.  </P> <P> Harbor built its advantage to 26-0 in the fourth quarter on a 10-yard run by  Phillip Robbins before Victor Valley (1-1) finally got on the scoreboard.  Kicking with a brisk wind, the home team's Kevin Bryant booted a pair of  56-yard field goals for all the points.  </P> <P> The victory matched Harbor's total for last year and came in the school's only  nonconference game. The Seahawks open Western States Conference play Saturday  at Santa Monica College, where Weems previously coached.  </P> <P> College action Saturday: At Portland, Ore., before a crowd of 1,157, the  second-ranked University of Portland defeated Loyola Marymount, 4-1, in a West  Coast Conference soccer game. The Lions, 1-5 overall and 0-2 in the WCC, were  trailing 2-0 at halftime but pulled to within 2-1 on Jan Klein's unassisted  goal at 49 minutes. However, Portland answered with a goal at 55:40 and scored  again later.  </P> <P> The Lions managed only five shots on goal, while Portland had 28. However,  Loyola goalie Alex Poli recorded six saves to keep the game close.  </P> <P> Loyola plays a nonconference game today at Oregon State before returning to Los  Angeles.  </P></p>

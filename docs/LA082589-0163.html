			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> APPLIANCE SALES DECLINE, GE TO LAY OFF 800  </P> <P> General Electric Co. said today that its appliance group, faced with declining  sales, will lay off at least 800 workers.  </P> <P> GE Group Executive Roger Schipke said in an interview that the permanent  layoffs will be spread through the giant conglomerate's appliance operations  from now through October.  </P> <P> The greatest impact, he said, would be at GE's big manufacturing plant in  Louisville, Ky. The Louisville complex, which produces laundry equipment and  refrigerators, is GE's headquarters for major appliances.  </P> <P> "We have to go further in cutting costs than we ever dreamed we'd have to in a  short period of time," Schipke said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unsold Appliances  </P> <P> He said GE has a warehouse full of unsold appliances at the Louisville complex  and "we even have some in public warehouses."  </P> <P> GE's action comes after major layoff announcements at Eastman Kodak &amp; Co.  and Campbell Soup Co.  </P> <P> Kodak said Wednesday that it would cut 4,500 jobs, or around 3% of its work  force. Campbell on Thursday said that it would slash 2,800 jobs, or nearly 6%  of its staff.  </P> <P> The precise number of job cuts at GE will not be known until this month's sales  figures are in, Schipke said. But the figures "look weaker than July's," he  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Union Workers on List  </P> <P> Among the 800 to lose their jobs, 500 will be union workers and the remainder  will be salaried staff.  </P> <P> The Louisville appliance complex has 12,800 workers, 9,000 of whom are union  employees. In 1973, a peak year for appliance sales, total employment at  Louisville was 23,000.  </P> <P> The Fairfield, Conn.-based GE has a staff of about 298,000.  </P> <P> Although the company is involved in aircraft engines, aerospace, plastics,  medical systems and broadcasting through its National Broadcasting Co.  subsidiary, the name GE represents household appliances to many consumers.  </P> <P> GE last May said it would phase out 400 jobs in oven-range production at  Louisville in the next few years.  </P></p>

At a 50-minute joint press conference held today with  Yeltsin  in the press center of Russian Foreign Ministry, Clinton said  the the U.S. was ready to "work on some joint projects" with  Russia.    One thing discussed in this Moscow summit was another aid  package totalling 2.5 billion U.S. dollars to Russia and other  former Soviet-bloc republics, Clinton said, adding that 70  percent of the finacial support earlier promised in the  Vancouver aid package is ready for delivery.    He said he was especially happy about President Yeltsin's  unyielding stance to press on reforms in Russia, adding he and  Yeltsin had discussed a number of ways for the U.S. and the  world community to promote Russia's reforms.    When asked if he will drop his "shock therapy" policy,  Yeltsin gave an immediate "no," adding "the reform will continue  to be implemented in a resolute way."    Clinton said Washington was ready to help Moscow to lessen  social hardships that appeared in the "shock therapy" reform  process. This year, the U.S. Government will approve funds to  shore up small private-run businesses in Russia and will  accelerate the founding of a new fund for Russia's large-scale  enterprises.    The U.S. commerce secretary will visit Moscow with a group  of  top executives from major U.S. companies on a trade mission to  Russia next March, he said.    Clinton said he convinced Yeltsin of the "Partnership for  Peace" idea in their last three rounds of talks.    Looking back on his past legs of European tour, Clinton said  he hope his trip could help the construction of a new European  security framework on the basis of free economy, common  allegiance to democracy and mutual respect for territorial  integrity.    Clinton said he was envisaging an highly integrated Europe,  both politically, economically and from the point of security.    Clinton said he will again meet with Yeltsin during the G-7  summit in Naples, Italy, next July and Yeltsin will visit  Washington this fall.</p>

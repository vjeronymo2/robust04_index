			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Jizhou (3769 3444 3166): "What Does the </F> PBC Change From `Looking for Subsistence' To `Being Given  Subsistence' Illustrate?--A Brief Discussion of the PBC's New  Financial Management System"]    [Text] The People's Bank of China [PBC] has completely  reformed its financial system in 1994, the key items of which  are eliminating profit retention, being exempt from the payment  of all taxes, and practicing an independent financial-budget  management system. Using a not necessarily completely fitting  metaphor, it is much as if the PBC's situation has changed  suddenly from its past "looking for subsistence" to "being given  subsistence" by the state. Why have we conducted this reform?  This has become a matter of great concern to those within and  outside of the PBC system.    A financial system in the final analysis is a product of an  economic system. A particular economic system is bound to  produce a corresponding financial system. And a particular  financial system is also bound to reflect the inherent laws and  demands of a particular economic system. Since 1984, the PBC has  begun to exercise the special functions of a central bank, no  longer concurrently handling industrial and commercial credit  business. But its financial system has been essentially one of  financial insurance, with its spending characterized by cost  management and overall expense-rate management, and its profit  distribution by the profit-retention system, with tax payment  according to law, as well as setting aside of credit funds.  This means that on one hand, the PBC has had to endeavor to  explore ways to establish a new central banking system and  exercise its particular functions, while on the other having to  do all possible to consider ways to resolve its own "livelihood"  and subsistence problems. As the PBC, as the central bank, has  long been subject to a relative shortage of all funds, it has  been hard for it to meet reform needs and normal expenditures  for business development and functional activities. But as our  banking reform has intensified, it is now clear that the major  functions of our reformed PBC are to formulate and apply  monetary policy, preserving currency stability, and to exercise  strict oversight of financial institutions, ensuring the safe  and effective operation of our banking system. So it was  imperative that we reform our former financial-insurance  financial system, by establishing an independent  financial-budget management system that differs from both our  fiscal budget and our administrative institution budget, to  reflect the relative independence of our central bank. As to  future central bank functions, basic currency handling authority  and credit scope regulation authority will be concentrated in  the head office, while branches will be responsible for  financial oversight, investigation of statistics, management of  the treasury, foreign exchange control, inter-branch clearing,  cash allocation, and interim position adjustment. With PBC  revenue concentrated mostly in the head office, and spending  mostly by branches, it will be only a uniform budget-management  system that will essentially better resolve the PBC's financial  revenue and expenditure problems.    The old PBC's financial sources were mainly profit  retention.  In other words, the next year's spending by the PBC depended  mainly on its current year's revenue. In recent years, as  capital construction has expanded, and new business, such as  securities and capital lending, have developed, all costs have  grown faster, causing great spending pressure. This has  objectively spurred the central bank, particularly branches at  all levels, to strive for more profits, by doing all possible to  diversify and develop new funding sources. This state of "the  central bank not acting like a central bank, and specialized  banks not acting like specialized banks," was undoubtedly  exceptionally adverse to the central bank doing a good job of  financial macroeconomic regulation and control, as well as not  contributing to honest administration. Thus, instituting the  new budget system, with the clear division of revenue and  expenditures into "two lines" with no links, so that proper  earnings are recouped and proper expenditures are rationally  met, can eliminate the PBC's tendency to strive for profits,  enabling it to better focus its main energies on implementing  monetary policy, to bring its financial macroeconomic regulation  and control function into full play.    As to the financial systems of central banks in certain  developed countries, while they may differ somewhat, what they  all have in common is central bank independence. Our new  financial system not only draws on overseas central bank  financial systems, but also reflects China's central banking  features and needs. In addition, we have also paid attention to  the relations among all parties, instituting a central bank  financial system that conforms to international practice while  being suited to China's particular conditions.    Our new financial management system is one of "uniform  budgeting, graded management, independent accounting, and  centralized responsibility for profits and losses." Our  fundamental principles for implementing this financial system  were mainly the two of practicing an independent  financial-budget management system and ensuring all  expenditures. Meanwhile, we considered that PBC profits are a  key component of state revenue and, under current conditions of  state revenue difficulties, PBC spending needs to be strictly  controlled and managed. So our formulation of the PBC  financial system and its future financial management had to  consider the following areas: 1) it had to reflect the PBC's  independent budget-management authority, with all financial  revenue and expenditure budgeting being examined and approved by  the head office; 2) it had to conform to PBC features, with  spending meeting the rational needs of normal business  development; 3) it had to tighten revenue control, with revenue  being recouped according to provision, and no arbitrary  reduction of revenue or concession of profits, to ensure state  revenue growth; 4) it had to observe state financial laws and  regulations, with a rigorous financial management system,  advocacy of the spirit of hard work, industry, and thrift,  strict control of budgets, economy in all spending, and  subjection to state revenue and auditing financial oversight.    The PBC's independent budget-management system is a new  model  and new system, the outcome of intensified banking reform. As  this reform is wide in scope, with a heavy workload, and quite  heavy technical demands and many meticulous management tasks, so  that many historical leftovers cannot be resolved at once, it  needs to be carried out positively and safely. We now  especially need to guard against the two tendencies of drawing  up too large budgets and easing revenue control, by doing a good  job of dovetailing the old and new systems, to prevent  unnecessary losses due to management mistakes. We need to  understand that our new financial system is absolutely not  merely to resolve the PBC's "subsistence" problems, nor is it a  replay of the "iron ricebowl" system. It shows that China's  central bank has begun to mature, with a stronger macroeconomic  regulation and control capability, while also being a brand new  yardstick, with new standards for starting an overall, accurate,  and specific investigation of the work and management levels of  the central bank at all levels. So implementing the new  financial system is not a matter merely for the leadership or  the accounting sector, but rather will require the joint efforts  of those throughout the PBC at all levels.</p>

			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Healthcare reforms hit drug sales in European markets Drugs sales in Europe's seven largest markets fell sharply in dollar terms last year after widescale healthcare reforms. Europe's five largest markets - Germany, France, Italy, the UK and Spain - have all announced or enacted reforms over the last 15 months. Sales in the seven largest markets, which include Belgium and the Netherlands, fell from Dollars 51.6bn (Pounds 34.6bn) in 1992 to Dollars 45.97bn last year, according to IMS International, a market research group. In the German market, Europe's biggest, sales dropped to Dollars 12.66bn from Dollars 14.82bn in 1992 - a fall of 9 per cent in local currencies. Italy, the third largest market, also declined, from Dollars 11.06bn to Dollars 8.45bn. The rate of sales growth fell in every therapeutic category in Europe. The cardiovascular market, which expanded at 7 per cent in 1992, grew only 2 per cent last year to Dollars 10.13bn. The growth rate for treatments for alimentary and metabolism disorders, the second most important category, also fell, down from 8 per cent in 1992 to only 1 per cent last year. The anti-infectives market which include anti-virals, antibiotics and anti-fungal drugs, posted the strongest growth, up 8 per cent last year compared with 9 per cent in 1992. Meanwhile, the US market, the world's largest, expanded only 5 per cent from Dollars 42.95bn to Dollars 45.22bn. Companies operating there have suffered from both political pressure aimed at moderating price rises and the negotiating of discounts by bulk purchasers. The Canadian market grew by 7 per cent in local currency, and rose from Dollars 3.5bn to Dollars 3.514bn measured in US dollars. The Japanese pharmacy market - excluding hospitals - increased by 6 per cent in yen terms, up from Dollars 16.6bn in 1992 to Dollars 20.2bn last year. But the Japanese ministry of health and welfare is implementing a 6.6 per cent price cut and other reforms aimed at limiting drugs spend-ing. Sales of cardiovascular drugs in the 10 largest markets - the US, Canada, Japan and the seven European countries - rose by only 1 per cent in local currency value, although in dollar terms they actually fell from Dollars 21.98bn to Dollars 21.2bn. Among the largest categories, anti-infectives were the best performers, up from Dollars 11.02bn to Dollars 11.7bn, a rise 9 per cent in local currencies. Worst performing were musculo-skeletal treatments - mostly anti-rheumatics. This was the only category to register a year-on-year local currency decline in the 10 markets. Sales fell by 1 per cent, as a series of patents expiring around the world undermined the market, which dropped from Dollars 7.13bn to Dollars 6.91bn.</p>

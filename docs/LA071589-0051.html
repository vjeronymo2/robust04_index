			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CONTROVERSY OVER MAPPLETHORPE'S ART  </P> <P> Times writer Allan Parachini misses the point about the controversy surrounding  the works of the late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe ("Arousing Art," July  11).  </P> <P> Ancient Greek sculptors did not use my tax money to create their art; Mr.  Mapplethorpe did. Using public money for what is a very private matter -- art  -- is bound to run into difficulties.  </P> <P> Bullwhips protruding from buttocks (as in a Mapplethorpe self-portrait) are, to  most, more offensive than the bestial detail of a mythical creature!  </P> <P> In addition, Mr. Mapplethorpe was primarily a photographer, and the status of  photography as art is still a point of contention among many aestheticians.  </P> <P> But all of this only serves to illustrate that public money should not be spent  on art or religion -- for the same reason -- and that the National Endowment  for the Arts has no more right to exist in this nation than would a "National  Endowment for Religion."  </P> <P> If the state endowed any religion with taxpayers' money, it would be asking  certain individuals to subsidize and promote what they consider to be offensive  or evil.  </P> <P> The only reason for a program such as the National Endowment for the Arts is to  extort money from unwilling contributors in order to subsidize projects that  would not be subsidized voluntarily.  </P> <P> Therefore, such a program cannot, by its own nature, "represent" American  interests but only serve a few Washingtonian highbrows' appetites for art-world  prestige and power.  </P> <P> CASEY FAHY  </P> <P> La Canada  </P></p>

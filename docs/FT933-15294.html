			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Technology: Through the language barrier - Worth Watching Japanese is one of the world's most complex languages, so transmitting information in Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana - the three alphabets - on to a trading screen poses a challenge for users of financial information systems. However, one of Japan's big banks is now operating with a new version of Fist, the dealing room system, which can recognise characters in Japanese. It is used in the bank's new equities trading division. Developed by Kapiti of the UK, Fist can be converted into other languages such as Arabic and Cyrillic. Also, among European languages, it will recognise unusual characters (as in Swedish), French accents and cedillas and German umlauts. The company claims Fist is the only trading system with such multi-lingual capabilities. Kapiti: UK, 0753 573244</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Steady close after an erratic session CITY analysts took a generally favourable view of trading figures announced yesterday by several leading British companies, and the stock market closed firmly after a session overshadowed by caution ahead of next week's UK Budget. The final hour of business saw shares moving ahead in spite of a dull start in New York, where the Dow Industrial Average was 12 points off in London trading hours. A new cut in repurchase rates by the Bundesbank encouraged UK investors. The FT-SE 100 Index traced an erratic pattern, with a fall of 5.5 points transformed into a net gain of nearly 12 by mid-morning. With most of the day's list of company results then in the market, share prices moved around overnight levels, losing heart for a while before turning upwards again at the close. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 at 2,956.7 for a rise of 6.8. Chart specialists were happy to see the 2,850 line held but sounded a little less confident that the 3,000 mark can be attained before the UK chancellor delivers his Budget on Tuesday. Trading volumes remained high, although the day's Seaq-reported total of 686.2m shares contrasted with 783.1m on Tuesday, when retail business was worth Pounds 1.53bn. Non-Footsie business returned to more average levels yesterday, at around 63 per cent of overall trading. However, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index slipped by 1.4 to 3,117.8. The search for further signs of economic recovery found some encouragement from company reports. Both BAT Industries and Cadbury-Schweppes did well after profits announcements. The stock market is now scanning company statements eagerly and, although prepared to be told that profits were hard to make last year, responds readily to indications that the clouds are lifting. Vickers, the defence and luxury car manufacturer, gained ground following results and news of a Pounds 60.5m rights issue. The much-heralded flow of rights issues has, so far, proved less threatening for share prices than was feared only two weeks ago. Reductions in some interest rates in Belgium and the Netherlands also encouraged investors, but suggestions that the Bundesbank might make a further move downwards found little credence among London strategists. Both marketmaking firms and fund managers have begun to consolidate trading positions ahead of the UK Budget. Analysts are in general agreement that the chancellor will disclose some fiscal tightening measures. Some believe that the apparent fragility of the economic recovery will keep such tightening to a minimum, and are of the view that harder measures may be held back until December. However, the market is counting on a further cut in base rates, if not on Budget Day, then very soon afterwards. Another firm performance by sterling yesterday buttressed confidence in the City's expectations of a Budget rate cut. The London Stock Exchange announced yesterday that, following the quarterly review of components of the FT-SE 100-share Index, Asda will join the index and WH Smith will be removed.

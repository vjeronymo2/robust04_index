			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian </F> delegation, by Sha'ul Menashe in Cairo; date not given; from the  "With the Midday Events" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Menashe] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, what is the current  status of the negotiations?    [Sha'th] We are in the final days before the signing of an  agreement and before the beginning of the withdrawal and entry  of the Palestinian police force. In these final days, there is  much and continuous work that should be done by all committees,  and we are working seriously on this. We are aware that in  these final days we should complete the work so that  implementation can begin. In fact, implementation has actually  begun. A withdrawal has begun and this is clear to all our  people everywhere. Deportees are returning to shoulder specific  responsibilities within the upcoming Palestinian administration.  Preparations are being made for the entry of the vanguards of  the Palestinian police. God willing, we will complete  preparations for implementing this agreement as soon as possible.    [Menashe] Final question. Do you believe that the deployment  of the Palestinian forces in the first stage should guarantee  security for the Palestinian people in the territories after the  departure of the Israeli forces?    [Sha'th] Undoubtedly. First, the Palestinian forces will  enter before the withdrawal of the Israeli forces. The Israeli  forces will then withdraw, and the Palestinian forces will  become fully responsible for security.    [Menashe] When will the Palestinian forces be armed?    [Sha'th] The Palestinian forces will be armed upon their  entry, but their security responsibility will begin when the  Israeli forces withdraw.    [Menashe] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you very much.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / World Trade News: Amec to set up joint venture with China Amec, the UK construction group, has agreed to set up a joint venture which will build petrochemical, oil and gas production facilities in China. The company's process engineering subsidiary yesterday signed an exclusive memorandum of understanding with Chinese Offshore Industrial Corporation, a state-owned shipbuilding group. The two companies are finalising joint-venture terms. The agreement covers construction of on-shore petrochemical plants as well as off-shore oil and gas production facilities for use in China. The deal will also enable the joint venture to build advanced deep-water floating production vessels in China for sale worldwide. Amec will contribute half the venture's costs. In return for enhancing its strategic position in the Chinese market, Amec will transfer technology for management of projects and engineering design. Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman, said: 'Although technology transfer was an issue, it was clear that many key skills and abilities already exist in our partner's organisation.' The venture will develop a joint facility at Huang Pu shipyard in Guangzhou province in southern China, capable of building modules of up to 5,000 tonnes each. COIC also has the ability to build large floating production platforms at a 300,000-tonne dry dock in north-east China. Amec is already building accommodation modules in partnership with COIC for Phillips Petroleum platforms in the South China Sea. Amec is one of Britain's biggest manufacturers and service providers for the UK oil and gas industries. Demand for North Sea off-shore platforms for has fallen sharply in the past 18 months. Amec has been seeking to use its technology to expand abroad.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Prestwick Airport to be sold BAA, the airports operator, has agreed to sell Prestwick Airport in south-west Scotland. The airport will be ultimately owned largely by a consortium of local authorities and businessmen chaired by Mr George Younger, the Conservative MP for Ayr. Under a deal completed yesterday BAA will sell the airport to British Aerospace, which manufactures civilian aircraft at Prestwick. BAe will sell the airport facilities to Ayrshire Community Airport Project (Acap) but retain the freehold of the runways, which it will lease to Acap. BAA has wanted to sell Prestwick ever since the government removed its monopoly on long-haul passenger flights from Scotland. Airlines using Prestwick immediately moved their operations to Glasgow. Last year Prestwick lost Pounds 4.8m on revenue of Pounds 5.1m. Mr Younger said staff would have to be cut from 80 to 55. Employees of PIK, the operating company to be formed by Acap, would be expected to accept job-sharing, multi-skilling and flexibility. Former BAA staff would be given priority in the allocation of posts. Mr Younger said Prestwick would build on its airfreight business. It would then hope to re-establish its charter business. He said he expected PIK to make a profit in its first year. BAe became involved in the transaction because it needed to safeguard Prestwick's runway to maintain its manufacturing operation making the Jetstream passenger aircraft. It also operates a flying school at Prestwick. Under the deal it will acquire the freehold to its own plant at the airport. If BAe ended manufacturing at Prestwick, Acap would have first refusal on the sale of runway. The cost is not being disclosed, although Acap said it was paying a 'substantial seven-figure sum'. Kyle and Carrick district council, the local authority, is providing Pounds 1.5m for the purchase of the airport and taking a stake in Acap.</p>

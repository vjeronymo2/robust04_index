Dr. S.P. Kohli, Deputy Director General, Ministry of Health  told the first international conference of the Indian  Association of Alliative Care here that cancer is no longer a  problem of developed countries but a matter of concern for  developing countries also.    She said the problem had acquired greater magnitude due to  an  increase in life expectancy resulting in a greater ratio of old  people in the population, increase in population, improved life  style as well as modernisation.    In India, breast, cervix and uterus cancer was most common  in  women while men were more prone to mouth, larynx and lung cancer.    These types of cancer were tobacco-related and could be  prevented by proper education, creating awareness and stopping  tobacco intake.    Lung cancer was nearly nine times more common in smokers  than  in non-smokers, Dr. Kohli said.    Considering this, the Union Government had chalked out a  plan  of action for prevention of cancer at an early stage, prevention  of tobacco intake in any form, early diagnosis of cancer  specially in cervic, breast and mouth.    She said that it was most unfortunate that most of the  cancer  patients in India reported at a very advanced stage in hospitals  and regional cancer centres, rendering the therapy ineffective.    She suggested that since there were more advanced cancer  cases in India, Palliative therapy should be provided to such  patients effectively.    In India, 30 percent of the cancer cases could not be  treated  with active therapy and "we could provide only palliative  therapy in such cases," Dr. Kohli said.    Cancer pain is not an imitable part of cancer, contrary to  common belief. Little is done to alleviate pain simply due to  inadequacy of medical education in cancer pain therapy, she said.    Medical students were taught to treat cancer but not cancer  pain. She suggested introduction of pain relief and palliative  care education at undergraduate and post-graduate teaching level.    The Union Government had started producing oral morphine in  collaboration with the World Health Organisation directly to 10  identified regional cancer centres. There was a proposal to  provide oral morphine to other teaching government medical  institutions, too.    She said that morphine was the cheapest and most effective  pain killer in cancer. Pain could be minimised in 80 to 98  percent of cancer cases if right drug in right dose and at right  time was given, she said.</p>

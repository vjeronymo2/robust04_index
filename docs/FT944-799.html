			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / UK Company News: London Securities disposes of its largest asset for Pounds 5m London Securities, the property company which is being wound down under a voluntary arrangement with its creditors, has sold its largest asset, Mill Ride Golf Club in Berkshire, for Pounds 5m. The proceeds will be paid to Barclays, which financed the development and is owed Pounds 15m, including rolled-up interest. The disposal came on the eve of today's extraordinary meeting at which shareholders will be asked to approve a deal which will pass control to Mr Michael Ashcroft, the Bermuda-based businessman who runs the ADT car auctions and security group, and Mr Jacques Gaston Murray. Under the terms of the deal London will buy a Pounds 17.6m property portfolio from Nu-Swift, the former fire extinguisher company taken private by Mr Ashcroft and Mr Murray earlier this year. Nu-Swift already owns 29 per cent of London. If the deal is approved, it will reduce its holding to 75 per cent through a placing in order to maintain the company's Stock Exchange listing. The deal will effectively give Mr Ashcroft and Mr Murray control of a quoted property company.</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Domestic boost for Renault RENAULT, the French state-owned car maker, sold 2m cars and light commercial vehicles last year, a 6.7 per cent increase on the previous year and the highest figure since 1983. Mr Patrick Faure, commercial director, attributed most of the improvement to a strong rise in sales in France, where Renault increased its market share nearly 3 points to 29.6 per cent, overtaking its private-sector rival Peugeot. French car registrations overall grew by 3.7 per cent last year to 2.1m, due to a surge in demand in December, according to the French car makers' committee (CCFA). Renault increased its share of the European car market from 10 per cent to 10.7 per cent. Its European sales rose by 5.7 per cent in a market down by 1 per cent, making it one of the few producers, along with VAG and Opel, to increase sales in the region for two consecutive years. Renault's sales fell slightly in the depressed German market, although the Clio and R19 remained the two most popular foreign models there. Sales also fell in Italy, as the lira's devaluation hit price competitiveness. The French group managed to shrug off the impact of sterling's devaluation and increase car sales to Britain by 14.5 per cent.</p>

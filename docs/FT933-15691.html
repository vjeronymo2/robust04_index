			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Raglan Property to consolidate shares RAGLAN PROPERTY Trust, the property investor and developer, is proposing to consolidate its share capital in line with intentions expressed at the time of the capital restructuring announced in March. As then indicated, the aim is to reduce the spread between the bid and offer price as a proportion of the share price. The proposed consolidation is on the basis of 1-for-25 existing 1p shares. A consequence will be that shareholders with fewer than 25 shares in the company will cease to be shareholders. As these represent only 0.01 per cent of the company's capital but a significant proportion of the number of shareholders, Raglan expects to make net savings in ongoing administration costs. There will be a a scrip issue of warrants to subscribe for new shares on the basis of one warrant for every 10 new shares held. They will enable the holder to subscribe for new shares at 30p per share at any time up to December 31 1995. It is expected that trading in the new shares and warrants will begin on August 2. Following the warrants issue and assuming full exercise, Landswell Holdings, Century City International, Mr Keith Holman and Mr Alan Fosler, deemed to be acting in concert, will hold about 11.1m new shares, representing 33.6 per cent of the enlarged issued capital. An extraordinary meeting on April 15 agreed to waive any requirement that any member of the concert party should make a general offer to shareholders.</p>

			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Sport: Gloucester glory fades into crisis - Rugby Union / John Hopkins chronicles the decline of a club that has failed to keep pace with progress and faces relegation DOWN the years, watching Gloucester play rugby at home has offered several pleasures. They nearly always won at their beloved ground, Kingsholm, and it is so close to the city centre. When covering a match there, the routine is to park in the cattle market or near the cathedral, lunch at Moran's, and then stroll to Kingsholm to see the elver-eaters consume another hapless victim. Sadly, though, this last ingredient has not been available this season. Moran's flourishes, the cathedral remains a brooding presence and the spectators are as partisan as ever. But Gloucester, for years one of the strongest clubs in England, are in crisis. In the Courage leagues, the first half of which ended last Saturday, Gloucester have tumbled to a position perilously close to the relegation zone of the first division. The division is being shrunk to 10 teams next season so four of 13 members will be relegated this year. At the start of the season, the clubs that seemed the likeliest relegation candidates were West Hartlepool and London Scottish, which had come up from the second division; Rugby, which had just avoided going down; and Bristol or London Irish. You would never have thought of Gloucester as being in danger. After all, last season they were semi-finalists in the Cup and finished fourth in the league. Yet, the unthinkable has happened. They have played six matches in the league and won only two, the second being the victory over Saracens at Kingsholm one week ago. They have four points and are equal ninth with another surprising struggler, Orrell. Last season, Orrell finished second in the league, level on points with Bath, the champions. Now, they and Gloucester hover just two points ahead of West Hartlepool, Saracens and Rugby. Tenth place means relegation. The troubles at Gloucester began last summer when 12 men, including England star Mike Teague, left to join rival clubs. Undoubtedly, some of them were poached, attracted by offers of a better job, a car, money, or some other inducement. Gloucester officials refuse to dirty their hands in what they regard as a rather grubby trade. Theirs is a one-sport city and there have always been plenty of good local players from which to choose. When Gloucester faced Leicester recently, every player was born within 10 miles of the cathedral. 'We will not break the rules,' says Keith Richardson, the club coach. 'If the RFU change the rules then that is a different matter but, at the moment, we abide by the present rules. If we do not run a centre of local excellence, who will? Somebody has to. If others have different systems, it is up to them. It would be a tragedy for rugby union if a club like Gloucester were stuffed by this sort of thing because the worst kind of people would then be in the driving seat.' Gloucester's style of play has, however, been rendered out of date by the new laws. They have always played to their forwards; but forward dominated drives, moving upfield in 20-yard surges, do not work now because if the forwards are stopped and do not release the ball quickly, then a scrum is awarded to the defending side. If there is one scene that sums up everything about Gloucester rugby club, its style of play and its supporters, it is this. Picture a night of stygian gloom at Kingsholm with rain slashing across the pitch. Gloucester win a ruck or a line-out and the ball moves to the stand-off, who hoists a steepling kick. From the 10,000 spectators comes a roar of 'Glaw-ster, Glaw-ster'. Meanwhile, all the forwards and many of the backs converge on the man who is trying to catch the ball. 'Gloucester used to be a club you measured yourself against,' says Tony Russ, the coach of Leicester. 'If you went to Kingsholm and won, that was a mark of a reasonable side. But that is no longer the case.' At times like these, of course, everything that happens is for the worse. Gloucester could have beaten Leicester in September. In spite of having a player sent off, they fought back from 8-22 to 21-22. Against Wasps a couple of weeks later, they had territorial superiority, only to lose 14-9. In fact, they lost each of their league matches by one score. To cap it all, in beating Saracens they lost Marcus Hannaford, their scrum-half, to a wild punch. They do not have a reserve. It never rains, it pours. Even at their best, Gloucester were far from all-conquering away from home. At Kingsholm, however, they were well-nigh unbeatable. So, although those losses at Leicester and Wasps hurt, they were as nothing compared with the home defeat by West Hartlepool, which had lost all its previous league games. There were signs of a revival when, first, Welsh club Pontypool and then South Africa's Transvaal province were defeated. Drastic team changes lay behind these victories. Out went the entire front row - including Peter Jones, who had played for Scotland last season - and in came the front row from the second team, the United. The team that beat Saracens showed seven changes from the team defeated by West Hartlepool. When the leagues started in English rugby, they increased the pressure on first-class clubs. With this season's change in the structure of the leagues, which means that four clubs go down to the second division, the pressure is increased even more. Thus, Gloucester look vulnerable. 'We have always said here that as long as we can keep our own players, then we do not need to worry,' says Peter Ford, the chairman. 'But we lost 12 in the close season. It may be time to change our policy.' The leagues start again on January 9 and, in the second half of the season, Gloucester face London Irish, Northampton and Bristol away and Bath, Orrell and Harlequins at Kingsholm. They need to win two and probably three of these games - otherwise, they will be relegated. This does not bear thinking about. But it could happen if they are unable to come to terms with the modern game - both its playing and its administration.</p>

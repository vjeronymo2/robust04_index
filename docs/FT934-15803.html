			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / International Company News: Valenciana sale sparks 42.5% increase at Aker AKER, the Norwegian cement and offshore technology group, announced a 42.5 per cent jump in profits after financial items to NKr526m (Dollars 74m) for the first eight months, against NKr369m in the same period last year. This term's figure was flattered by a NKr702m exceptional gain stemming mainly from the sale of the group's stake in Valenciana, the Spanish cement producer. The group said results for the full year would be 'considerably better' than the NKr368m profit of last year. Operating revenues in the first eight months were NKr11.86bn, compared with NKr11.49bn. The group swung to an operating profit of NKr518m from a NKr93m loss and it cut its financial expenses by NKr159m to NKr89m. Cement and building materials saw sales slip to NKr3.92bn from NKr3.96bn, but the division made a profit after financial items of NKr191m, after a NKr53m loss. Oil and gas technology was also back in profit, with a NKr343m surplus compared with a NKr193m loss.</p>

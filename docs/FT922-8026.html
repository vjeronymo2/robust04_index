			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / People: Wright steps into Municipal breach Brian Wright, the former group executive director of the UK's biggest insurer, Sun Alliance, is to help Municipal Mutual find a buyer for its general insurance business. Municipal, which is owned by its policyholders and insures nine out of ten local authorities, announced last week that it was seeking to transfer its non-life business after two years of heavy losses. Its former group chief executive Andrew Maclean left the group last week and Wright, who recently retired after a successful career at Sun Alliance, has agreed to step in to steer the group through potentially complex negotiations and will act as chief executive while these negotiations take place. As many as four companies - including a number of continental European players - are said to be interested in Municipal's business, which amounts to about 3 per cent of the UK non-life market. ***** Desmond Fitzgerald, chief executive of Mathews, Mulcahy &amp; Sutherland, md of Marsh &amp; McLennan Inc and a member of the executive committee of Bowring Marsh &amp; McLennan Ltd, has been appointed to the board of MARSH &amp; McLENNAN EUROPE. ***** Paul Crayk is appointed a divisional director of SBJ REGIS LOW. ***** Silvio Caflisch, senior vice-president of Winterthur, has been appointed chairman of PROVIDENT LIFE. ***** Richard Boggis-Rolfe has been appointed to the board of BNB RESOURCES.</p>

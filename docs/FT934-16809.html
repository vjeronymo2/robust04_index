			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Clinton insists US will complete Somali task PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday insisted the US would 'complete our mission' in Somalia, despite the deaths of at least 12 US soldiers in a battle in Mogadishu on Sunday night between UN troops and militias loyal to Gen Mohammed Aideed, Somalia's rebel warlord. US officials said a number of American troops were also missing. Mr Les Aspin, defence secretary, warned that the US expected humanitarian treatment of a helicopter crewman shot down over Mogadishu. President Clinton stressed that if any harm came to captured Americans, US and not UN forces would respond unilaterally. The president said the US still planned to hand over its mission in Somalia to other nations, and urged the UN to step up efforts to re-establish a political structure in the country. 'Meanwhile, be sure we will do whatever is necessary to protect our own forces and complete our mission.' Mr Aspin said the US was sending four tanks, 14 Bradley fighting vehicles, two AC-130 gunships, replacement helicopters and about 200 extra troops to Somalia 'to prevent the return of anarchy and famine'. One Malaysian UN peacekeeper was also killed in Sunday's battle, the fiercest clash since the UN military took command of Somalia in May. US officials said 'one or two' top aides to Gen Aideed had been captured. The International Committee of the Red Cross counted 500 Somali wounded in Mogadishu's three hospitals. Journalists said they saw truck-loads of corpses being driven from around the Bakara market where the battle raged until dawn. UN military officials said they had captured 24 of Gen Aideed's militiamen. Hostile Somalis dragged the corpses of two US soldiers through the streets of Mogadishu in a display of anti-US and anti-UN sentiment which is becoming more entrenched as the death toll rises. Leaders of both parties in the US Congress yesterday stepped up their demands for the US to withdraw from Somalia. 'Enough Americans have died,' said Senator Robert Dole, leader of the Republican minority in the Senate, in a call backed by Senator Robert Byrd, the senior Democrat who presides over most government spending. Although members of Congress last week dropped an attempt to force Mr Clinton to justify the continued US military presence in Somalia, in the face of a threatened presidential veto, they retaliated by stripping funding for peacekeeping operations from a defence spending bill. 'If the US. . . pulls out its troops, then other countries which have sent troops to Somalia are unlikely to remain committed to the UN operation,' Mr Terence Lyons, a policy director at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said. Even scaling down US military involvement would debilitate the UN mission.</p>

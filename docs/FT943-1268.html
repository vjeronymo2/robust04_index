			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / How to spend it: Ermenegildo Zegna expands London business ERMENEGILDO ZEGNA, the Italian menswear company, has for some years had a seriously sophisticated shop in Bond Street purveying its own high quality menswear. This week it opens another shop in Covent Garden (42, Shelton Street, London WC2) with the younger, slightly less formal man in mind. While the Bond Street shop concentrates on the more structured, 'sartorial' lines, in Covent Garden there is a beautifully relaxed line of what Zegna calls its 'soft collection'. Zegna defines soft as 'wearing pants in cotton or Donegal, mixing them with a nonchalant, easy checked or windowpane jackets' or soft could be an 'updated jacket, unstructured with lowered shoulders and shirt sleeves.' The picture above shows exactly what 'soft' is all about - that Italian gift for combining garments to create an air of understated chic. It has nothing to do with skimping on quality. All the fabrics are designed and manufactured by Zegna. It has everything to do with attitude, with wanting to wear more relaxed, more comfortable clothes. Aiming at the younger man, the new shop will have slightly lower prices  - wool suits will average about Pounds 550, jackets start at Pounds 395.</p>

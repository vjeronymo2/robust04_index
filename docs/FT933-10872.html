			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Exxon accused over explosion in Hong Kong EXXON of the US and China Light and Power, the Hong Kong utility company, have been accused of withholding crucial information from a Hong Kong government investigation into an explosion at their jointly-owned Castle Peak power station. The allegations were made in a USDollars 125m (Pounds 83.8m) legal action filed in Texas. They are alleged to have removed 'vital evidence from the scene of the explosion', and to have held back a detailed internal report which had suggested 'inadequate and improper maintenance and training' at the plant. The explosion of two hydrogen cylinders at the plant last August killed two workers. A coroner's verdict of accidental death was given, but the latest allegations could lead to a reopening of the inquest. Mr John Leigh, CLP's company secretary, said yesterday in an official statement that the allegations were 'without merit'. However, he said the Castle Peak Power Company (Capco), which is 60 per cent owned by Exxon and 40 per cent by CLP, intended to consult the attorney-general. The lawsuit has been filed in Alice, Texas, by Mr Michael Ford, a Hong Kong-based barrister who represented Capco at the coroner's inquest. Mr Ford is suing Capco and five Exxon group companies, claiming damage to his reputation, loss of income and emotional distress after he was dismissed during the inquest. If successful, this could trigger further legal action by the widows of the two men who died in the accident. Mr Ford alleges he was instructed to hold back relevant material from the inquest. After refusing to comply he was dismissed in such a manner as to 'create the impression that the plaintiff had been removed because of incompetence, dishonesty or unethical behaviour'. CLP has responded by seeking an injunction in Hong Kong to prevent Mr Ford disclosing confidential information obtained while he was representing the company. China Light and Power is the monopoly supplier of electricity to Kowloon and the New Territories of Hong Kong. Exxon owns 60 per cent of the company's four power stations in the colony.</p>

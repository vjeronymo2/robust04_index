			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] It was revealed that based on an initial study by  our military, the unidentified submarine our Navy monitored is  believed to be a Chinese Communist (R-Class) submarine.  However, informed sources said unless a submarine is forced to  expose its identity or surface above water, no country would  admit ownership. Because our military did not force it to  expose itself, its identity cannot be confirmed as yet.    It was also learned that yesterday a National Defense  Ministry [NDM] official pointed out that an incident like this  would not lead to a tense situation in the Taiwan Strait.  Defense Minister Sun Chen also said that because the Chinese  Communists have a large number of submarines and these  submarines could not simply stay in their bases, their  activities along our coast can be expected. Lieutenant General  (Chou Ching-hung), chief of staff of the Navy, yesterday also  told reporters at the Legislative Yuan that there have been  frequent submarine activities in the Taiwan Strait. (Lin  Yu-fang), director of Tamkang University Institute for Strategic  Studies, said that the Navy's success in pinning down an  intelligence-gathering submarine proves that the Navy's  antisubmarine system is capable of coping with the Chinese  Communists' submarine activities and that our purchase of  submarines from other countries to strengthen our naval power  remains crucial to security in the Taiwan Strait. Our reporter  Liu Yu-mei has this report:    [Begin recording] [Liu] The NDM has confirmed that in the  course of the Han Kuang military exercise, which involved both  air and naval forces, a Chinese Communist submarine approached  in an attempt to gather military intelligence. Our Navy sent  S-2T and S70C antisubmarine helicopters and warships to pursue  and block its way for as long as two days. Finally, they opened  an exit to let the Chinese Communist submarine go.    (Li Yu-fang), director of the Tamkang University Institute  for Strategic Studies, said: Although the Control Yuan a few  days ago approved the censure of NDM officials involved in the  purchase of S- 2T's, the submarine incident indicated that our  antisubmarine system can indeed monitor Chinese Communist  submarines and that it demonstrated our military's capability to  deal with any crisis.    [(Li Yu-fang)] Our response and action during this incident  are truly praiseworthy. First, from a purely military point of  view, we were capable of pinning down the Chinese Communist  submarine. In addition, we were able to react quickly and lay  siege to it. What we want is not war but military stability in  the Taiwan Strait. If we were to pin it down indefinitely, the  Chinese Communists would most likely send other submarines or  even aircraft to rescue it. In that case, clashes would be  difficult to avoid. Thus, we let the Chinese Communists learn a  lesson and then resolved the crisis to avoid a clash.    [Liu] Regarding the two sides' military strength, the  Chinese  Communists have publicly claimed that it has more than 90  submarines. However, the number of those that could be used in  combat was generally believed to be around 40. However, this  number is still far greater than what we have today. Purchasing  submarines from other countries will remain crucial to security  in the Taiwan Strait.    [(Li Yu-fang)] I believe this incident is important in  (words  indistinct) military clashes in the Taiwan Strait. It would not  be easy for the Chinese Communists to launch an all-out war  against Taiwan as soon as war starts. The most important thing  for them is to seal off the Taiwan Strait. [words indistinct]    (Lin Cheng-i), a researcher at the Academia Sinica, hoped  that we would publish information regarding Chinese Communist  activities in the Taiwan Strait.

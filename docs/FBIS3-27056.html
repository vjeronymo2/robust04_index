U.S. President Bill Clinton, followed by French President  Francois Mitterrand and British Prime Minister John Major, were  all around appealing to King Fahd for better chances for their  own countries.    Behind the heavy lobbying was the hot rivalry for survival  prominently between American aircraft makers, Boeing and  McDonnell Douglas, and Airbus Industries, owned by four European  countries.    Like his counterparts abroad, Clinton, though busy with  health care reform and crime fighting at home, still has a new  role to play: the salesman-in-chief for corporate America.    In announcing Saudi Arabia's purchase of American planes  worth nearly six billion U.S. dollars here today, Clinton made  good on his promise to strive for more and fair trade  opportunities for U.S. firms.    "We worked hard on this, and we will continue to work hard  at  home and abroad to help our people thrive in the global  economy," Clinton said at a hastily arranged White House  ceremony this morning.    Flanked by Frank Shrontz, chairman of Boeing company, and  John McDonnell, chairman of McDonnell Douglas Corp., the  President said he was proud to be called the salesman-in-chief  of corporate America.    According to Commerce Secretary Ron Brown today, who visited  Saudi Arabia twice late last year to discuss potential plane  sales to Riyadh, President Clinton called King Fahd on the phone  in person last year.    "I have talked with the President many times on this issue,"  Brown said. "He was very familiar with everything that we were  doing."    In selling 50 airplanes to Saudi Arabia, the U.S. is  expected  to keep nearly 200,000 high-paying, high-tech jobs in the two  companies, and in United Technologies Inc. and General Electric  Co., makers of aircraft engines.    Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, the first and third largest  aircraft makers, are competing with the European Airbus  consortium, the producer of one in every four of the world's  commercial airplanes.    In the Seattle-based Boeing company, commercial jetliner  deliveries dropped from 440 in 1991 to 300 last year, while its  profit margin -- the net income as a percentage of the total  sales, was pared down from 5.3 percent to 4.6 percent.    The overall earning of the Long Beach, California-based  McDonnell Douglas Corp. is up thanks to increasing demand for  key military planes like C-17 transport aircraft and F-15  fighters. But as far as commercial aircraft were concerned, the  firm had more orders canceled than won in 1993.    The two companies, which have a combined workforce of  150,000  are still cutting hands. The total employment in U.S. civil  aircraft industry stands at some 250,000, down nearly one third  from the peak level in 1991.    The plight, observers noted, explains how dependent  corporate  America has become on foreign sales in the wake of defense  conversion and their own fat cutting.    A year ago, President Clinton, in his first major foreign  trade policy speech, pledged that his government would be more  than aggressive in assisting American companies abroad in order  to make them "compete, not retreat."    In the national export strategy unveiled late last year, the  administration promised to help boost the exports of key  industries like auto, telecommunications, petroleum, banking and  insurance services.    The Commerce Department, meanwhile, is listing 10 countries  as key emerging markets for American products and preparing  specifically targeted export strategies.    According to government officials, every billion dollars of  exports means 20,000 new jobs at home. The new deal with Saudi  Arabia is 15 percent of the annual U.S. exports of commercial  aircraft.    The administration is also eyeing the profitable phone  markets in Saudi Arabia, which plans to put in 1.5 million more  phone lines, willing to help AT&amp;T against Siemens of Germany  in  winning four billion dollars worth contracts.    "If there are two or three or four American companies  competing against foreign competitors, we're going to support  all of them," Secretary Brown said. "We're not going to choose  among or between American companies."</p>

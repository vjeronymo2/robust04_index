			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Arts: Why artists were drawn to Dieppe - William Packer reviews the Brighton Festival's principle exhibition THE BRIGHTON Festival, feeling itself perceived as principally a festival of music, has this year given its programme of exhibitions a particular emphasis. Rendez-vous a Dieppe is its principal offering, a celebration, as its sub-title puts it, of the town and its artists from Turner to Braque. Admirably put together by John Willet, an English art-historian who lives just outside Dieppe, it indeed answers that deceptively simple brief, and the essentially uncurious visitor may pass happily down that chronology, indulged at each point by particular yet often unfamiliar examples of the highest quality. Its true substance is quite as much in social as art-historical, its subject the strong link established over more than a century, by way of Newhaven, between the two opposing and yet so very different popular watering-places that face each other across the Channel. But important though Brighton has long remained to the English, as an occasional resort - raffish, bracing, above all accessible - it has never drawn to it a community of artists. Individuals may have come and gone, but there was never a group, a Brighton school, an artists' colony. The serious creative traffic was always passing through, and for the most part one way. Quite why one town should become a hive and focus of creative energy and another not is always an open question. It is not simply by a quality of the picturesque, for both France and England have quaint and historic towns, all still quite artist-free in any proper art-historical sense. The artist may well stop for a while en route, but soon passes on, a few studies made, perhaps, a canvas filled, but nothing more and never again. It takes a Venice or a Paris to establish the interest permanently. Where a collective habit does form, such election seems always arbitrary and temporary, a creature of chance and circumstance. Dieppe was always a special case, but even Dieppe's moment has come and gone, with few easels now among the tourists. For the French painters at a certain time, the harbours, cliffs and wide skies of the western Normandy coast were obviously attractive, but no more so than anywhere else within easy reach of Paris. The Seine valley soon drew Monet to the sea, for example, and Braque came to live a little along the coast at Varengeville; but even so, for the Frenchman, there was always the South. For the English, however, France is the South, and Dieppe the first town of the South and the great escape. For so many of us simply to be in France is enough. In days of slower travel the temptation to draw breath after the crossing, to stay a day or two and look around, was even stronger than it is now. An artist might take a house and studio perhaps, find himself staying longer than ever he planned, show his work to others who might well come over and take a house - and stay rather longer than planned . . . It is thus hardly remarkable that of the artists associated with Dieppe, rather more are English than French, nor that of the French, some such as Helleu and Blanche, should have had close English connections. Most particular of all, it was Sickert who came and stayed, and by virtue of his commanding authority among them, persuaded so many of his fellows and disciples to follow him. In earlier years, such painters as Turner and Bonington came over and passed through: between the wars, Ben Nicholson and Christopher Wood came over to sit at the feet of Braque: but of them all, the Sickert battalions at the turn of the century were those who made Dieppe most their own. Here they all are, the Camden Townites, Gilman, Ginner and Spencer Gore, the fin-de siecle aesthetes, Conder and Beardsley, Ben's father William Nicholson who is at the very least as significant a painter as his son, and William Rothenstein, and Whistler, and Fergusson, and Matthew Smith. From Delacroix and Daubigny to Monet and Pissarro to Braque and Gauguin, the French are properly celebrated, but this remains, by its very nature and emphasis, a gratifyingly English exhibition.

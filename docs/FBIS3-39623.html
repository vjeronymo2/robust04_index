			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lurdes Ferreira: "Risks and Defects of </F> Portuguese Economy"]    [Excerpts] "Dependence on subsidies" is a refuge without a  future: If Portuguese entrepreneurs do not prepare themselves,  Portugal runs the risk of becoming a subcontractor for the  benefit of its European partners. This is the clear warning  delivered by a study by Luis Barata of the central planning  department of the state secretariat for regional planning and  development published last week. The study details the risks and  defects of industrial specialization in the Portuguese economy.    The study also presents a number of disquieting conclusions  on the future of some industries with regard to specialization.  For instance, it emphasizes the probability that industries such  as textiles, electronic components, and pharmaceuticals will  witness the deterioration of their industrial specialization in  the medium term.    The scenario is no more encouraging for metallurgy,  armaments, telecommunications, and machine tools, given  increasing competitiveness. In addition, the horizon is clearly  unfavorable for data processing equipment, cereals, organic  chemistry, base minerals, optics, and photography.    On the basis of indicators culled from the end of the 1980's  and the beginning of the 1990's, the author argues that Portugal  "continues to present a weak industrial structure" at a time  when specialization is seen as the name of the game. [passage  omitted]    According to the study, the recent evolution of the nation's  industries "has not brought significant changes to its basic  characteristics, maintaining an imbalance in which the textile  and forestry sectors have a disproportionate weight."    The fragile aspects of the Portuguese economy are also  defined: a weak industrial infrastructure that is too polarized,  be it by regions or by sectors, and rests on the "old,  superseded" standard of cheap labor. Therefore, new methods of  production, improved quality, and the establishment of a good  image are considered decisive for those sectors in which the  Portuguese economy traditionally maintains comparative  advantages: textiles and clothing, ceramics, wines, and forestry  products. [passage omitted]    The foreseeable trend for the three large categories in  which  the author divides the Portuguese economy (internationally  specialized, dependent and relatively self-sufficient) are as  follows: in the activities that were specialized in the past,  there are good prospects for beverages, leather and footwear,  canned fruits and vegetables, and consumer electronics, because  of previous investments [passage omitted].    For dependent industries, increasing specialization is  foreseen in six fields: electrical equipment of various types,  aeronautics, nonferrous metals, transportation and public works  equipment, and oleaginous products.    Strangely, the study maintains that specialization in the  production of auto parts will tend to stagnate. Despite the  increased auto production foreseen for this sector--mainly  because of the Ford-Volkswagen project--the study believes that  "imports will tend to increase unless companies furnishing both  products for the Portuguese market and a majority percentage for  direct export establish themselves in Portugal."    For the relatively self-sufficient industries, there are  positive prospects for industrial electrical equipment,  ceramics, cement/stone, commercial vehicles, nonferrous metals,  furniture, light vehicles, plastics, and boiler equipment. In  spite of positive signs for the future of these activities, the  study warns that real results depend on the evolution of the  Portuguese and Spanish economies, contrary to the other two  groups, where problems are of a "European, or even world  dimension."</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Technology: Essential tool for the home worker - Worth Watching Working from home has meant a surge over the past year in the use of domestic facsimile machines in the US, according to the latest report from BIS Strategic Decisions. Of those people questioned who operated a business from home, 47 per cent had bought their fax machine in the past year. Of the respondents who took work home from the office, 89 per cent said their machines had been purchased in the last 12 months. The report, User Requirements for Home Facsimile Product, concludes that need, rather than falling prices, has proven the driving force behind the purchases.

A Wisma Putra (Foreign Ministry) official said the ceremony  was conducted upon recommendation by Dr. Mahathir, who picked  the idea during his recent visit to Europe.    During his four-day visit, President Alija would also be  meeting the Bosnian community here and having a dialogue with  ambassadors from members of the Organisation of International  Conference countries.

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Israeli health move deepens coalition rift A special session of Israel's cabinet yesterday approved a controversial health insurance proposal, deepening rifts in a fragile coalition government. Approval of the health insurance compromise will force the resignation of Mr Haim Ramon, health minister. By a 9-5 majority, the Labour-led cabinet backed a compromise endorsed by the Labour convention on Sunday, rather than opting for a bill put forward by Mr Ramon which would have separated the trade union movement from health-care contributions. Mr Ramon's bill also called for all insurance contributions to be collected by the National Insurance Institute rather than the Kupat Holim Clalit, the health-care arm of the trade union federation. The Labour convention compromise, endorsed by the cabinet, maintains the link between the trade union and the Kupat Holim, leaving the Kupat Holim with 50 per cent of the insurance dues. Mr Ramon and the four cabinet ministers from the left-wing Meretz party opposed the compromise move. After the vote Mr Ramon, a popular figure among the young reform generation of the Labour party, said he would resign at next Sunday's cabinet meeting. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin is anxious to retain Mr Ramon and is trying to persuade him to stay, possibly as minister without portfolio. The health insurance compromise is unpopular in the country and could be voted down in the Knesset (parliament), threatening the government and its peace platform. Mr Binyamin Netanyahu, leader of the opposition Likud, said his party would oppose the compromise and vote for Mr Ramon's original bill. If Mr Ramon leaves the government, it would weaken the coalition, already enfeebled after the ultra-orthodox Shas party left the coalition last year after charges of corruption were brought against two Shas ministers. The internal difficulties came as Mr Yoel Singer, legal adviser to the Foreign Ministry, was due back in Israel from Switzerland to present a draft Israeli-PLO agreement to Mr Rabin. The draft was hammered out in Switzerland between Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman. Israeli officials said the main obstacles to a final agreement to implement Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho had been largely agreed in Switzerland but some details remained unresolved. Mr Rabin has apparently taken a tougher position on control over border crossings and the size of the Jericho area than his foreign minister. Mr Said Kamal, the PLO envoy to Egypt, yesterday confirmed the details of the Peres-Arafat compromise and said: 'Rabin has the final word now and reaching agreement depends on his approval of the compromise reached between Peres and Arafat.' A drafting team from both sides will meet in Cairo this week before Mr Peres and Mr Arafat meet on Sunday in the Egyptian capital, where they could initial the agreement.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Bags Full of Ganja Found"] </F>   [Text] Nearly 700 pounds of ganja wrapped in burlap bags  for distribution was found in the brush at an East End beach  Friday afternoon at 2 p.m.    Police said the actual weight of the drug came to 697.5  pounds. The ganja was contained in 23 separate bags that were  marked `Jamaica' on the outside said a police source.    The ganja appeared to be professionally packaged and  intended  for transhipment to another destination, most likely the U.S.,  he said.    Drugs Squad Superintendent Trevor Cutts could not be reached  for comment on the discovery. In the past, Mr. Cutts has said  the large amounts of ganja found on Cayman beaches indicate the  islands are being used to ship drugs from Jamaica and Honduras  to the U.S. through Miami.    Travellers from Grand Cayman are seldom detained and  searched  when clearing Customs at Miami International Airport.</p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLACING THE BLAME FOR A LACK OF MORAL FIBER  </P> <P> I agree wholeheartedly with Josephson. But he forgot to mention one other  reason (for young people's lack of ethics) besides parents, teachers and  employers: television.  </P> <P> I blame TV for lots of things, including crime and murder. Children see all  these shows with killings and shootings, and they become desensitized and think  it's no big deal to shoot somebody.  </P> <P> BRIGITTE CHRISTE  </P> <P> Calabasas  </P></p>

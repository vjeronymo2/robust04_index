Taking part are 220  delegates from 66 regions of Russia.    They intend to discuss the draft of a party program and the  results of the elections to the Federal Assembly, amend the  rules and elect the steering bodies, and work out the party's  strategy and tactics for local elections.    In his speech on the party program, its leader Sergey  Shakhray declared that his party is "a national conservative  organization, respecting such traditional values as state,  family, property, and morality." In his words, the party aims  at keeping Russia as a state by recognizing the economic,  political, and cultural diversity of its regions.    Shakhray proposed endorsing only "the framework of the  program" at this stage and to finalize it at the 2d Congress,  planned for the spring this year. Before that the program could  be explained in the party's regional branches.    As a delegate has revealed to Interfax, the money for the  forum have come "from the party fund and from the commercial  structures, sharing the party's goals and tasks."</p>

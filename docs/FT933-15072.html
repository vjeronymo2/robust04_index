			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Utilities boosted by regulator RELIEF greeted the first report from the director-general of Electricity Supply on price controls and shares in the regional electricity companies saw healthy gains. The industry had feared the regulator would come down heavier on the measurement of generating costs and comment on the levels of dividends. The Recs' reporting season, just ended, saw a 'dividend race' develop as the companies revealed hefty increases with Southern turning in a winning 17.6 per cent rise. The market was also pleased by the new pricing formula having feared a figure of four instead of the two allocated. Among the rises yesterday, London put on 14 to 499p, Seeboard 15 to 525p, Midlands 13 to 508p and Southern 7 to 504p. Mr Angelos Anastasiou at Panmure Gordon said: 'After the recent strong showing by the shares, the upside from here may be limited, but there's no reason for them to go down.' One of the other beneficiaries of the report was the water sector where hopes of similar treatment from Ofwat combined with strong yield support to see solid advances. Among these, Anglian added 11 to 495p, Severn Trent 12 to 475p with 2.3m traded and Thames 13 to 490p.</p>

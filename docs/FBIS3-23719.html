			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kazakh </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant-Colonel Kakimkhan Quttybayev, senior </F> officer of the Republic of Kazakhstan Internal Military Press  Center: "The Many Hopes of Kazakhs Living in China."]    [Text] Since the independence of our country we have  achieved many things. One of them is that [some of] our kindred,  living in foreign countries, have returned home. We have also  opened paths of communications and relationships with some  [others]. Due to such possibilities, I returned to the Ile  Kazakh Autonomous Oblast in the Chinese People's Republic. In  fact, seeing with my own eyes was better than hearing about  things there. In order to make known to people what came to mind  there, I have written this article. I acquainted myself somewhat  with the living conditions of our kinsmen in a neighboring  country. Most were involved with individual enterprise. One  receives gain according to how one works. The results are in  one's own hands. They are dependent upon one another. There is  no disorder. They began to move along that favorable road at the  end of the 1970s. It is no secret that up until that time they  witnessed unheard of things and suffered repeated difficulties,  and we witnessed how they, exhausted, took weak steps towards a  new life. Most of the marks of great suffering are still not  wiped from their hearts.    However, the Kazakh people who have survived all that and  have left their suffering behind them, are not bad off today.  There are sufficient numbers of rich Kazakhs raising large herds  of horses and other fat livestock. Each person does the best  they can. There are no limits to livestock raising and each  raises as many as he can. The amount of land available for use  decreases with each passing year. By law each person is to  receive 2 mu of land. How is the term mu to be understood? I  asked. In your terms there are 16 mu to a hectare. Thus eight  persons must be fed from the products of a hectare of land. That  is very little land.    We are not made to suffer difficulty. Products of animal  husbandry are numerous. We have our summer pastures and our  winter pastures. They are unsuited for growing grain; they are  mountain defiles and sloping areas. However, they are  exceptional places for raising livestock. There are many places  where the richest, most nourishing grass is abundant, thus,  answered Qudaybergen Sarsenbayuly, a thirty-three-year-old  relative of mine serving as a leader. Qudaybergen, after a  pause, contined: if one sows seed in the proper time in the new  lands and takes care of the crop, it will be completely adequate  for no one even if harvested without loss. If one is inattentive  and lazy, you will not have enough food no matter what, and you  will be dependent on someone else.    ...The dazzling crops around us waved like the ocean. The  grains of wheat growing without weeds excited us involuntarily.  Economical use and respect for the land had become a good  tradition. At the time of the spring sowing and during the  autumn harvest they are incomparable. However, they provide  nothing whatever during the rest of the time. The festivals and  the visiting go on during those times.    During the years you see the good and the bad as a leading  official (equivalent to the combined jobs of sovkhoz director  and of a party organization secretary). What do you think of the  current way of life? I asked again.    Indeed, when I came on the scene it was a time of want and  of  poverty. The difficulty was not just mine, the entire people  were suffering. Alas, our Kazakhs were in a sorry state! We were  suffering completely intolerable difficulties. God willing, now  the character of life has changed and things are easy for the  people.    In front of us there were more than a hundred horses and  cattle and nearly a thousand smaller livestock. I think that our  present way of life is good. It is a time when each person  believes in his own honest labor. No one is trying to cheat or  intimidate us. I now have nearly 70 horses and cattle, and  something like 300 smaller livestock. Other than income [tax]  paid to the government, I have no other loss. However, I was  unable to get all of my livestock safely through the winter  without loss. I know what the problem was. There is no one who  can order me to increase my livestock to a thousand or to  decrease their numbers. For that reason, I bought 30 head of  horses and cattle and as many smaller livestock as I needed. One  sets one's own level of profit. I see my labor solely in terms  of productivity. Under the old system I herded the government's  livestock, and for this purpose the government had to provide  enclosures, hay, and a monthly salary. Transportation was given  to the officials set over me, and I had to pay them a monthly  salary. That is all gone today. The government expends no funds  whatever for me. I myself prepare food for the livestock and  build enclosures. He paused as if he was thinking about  something else.    Your situation is good. Your children have shoes, you have a  livelihood. People notice when people are living well. A person  still has his hopes. What is your hope now? I asked very  directly.    Indeed there is no one without his hopes. One thing, which  is  not just my hope but the hope of all Kazakhs, is returning to  the homeland. If we can face Mecca [to pray] on the soil of our  ancestors, all our hopes will be fulfilled. Thus saying, he  stopped abruptly, his eyes filled with tears, and he wept loudly  before finishing his words. The people, collected at the head of  the table, went on droning a song mixed with tears as if  approving of the words of some aqsaqal [Kazakh elder]. The songs  were beautiful, the words pleasant. They are sufficient  testimony to the longing for the homeland. The questions coming  from all directions, the words of cheer pronounced to our  kinsmen moved us profoundly. One was confused by the number of  people invited without ceremony into their houses as guests.  They went and got eighty-six-year-old aqsaqal Nesipbay mentioned  at one point in the conversation. He was born in Taldyqorghan  oblast, Sarqant Rayon, the present Energiya Kolkhoz. Calling to  mind his country and the place where he had grown up, he wept  loudly. He read a poem of 50 verses dedicated to President  Nazarbayev and to the independence of our country and set many  questions in motion. He was in service as an old man, and had  seen a great deal of life. He was an aqsaqal capable of making  an impression with words. He listened to some, and others  listened to him. He said: We are not looking for land. If the  two countries come to an agreement, we will move on our own and  will have our own resources to return to our country. The  education of all of us, old and young, has been his work. Work  has raised us all. We will not cause the government any  difficulty. We promise that we will flourish through our own  labor. All we need is a place with water. Farming and livestock  raising, those are our traditional occupations. We have no great  interest in technology. What we believe in is the power of our  own knowledge, he said, summarizing what was in the minds of  many. All joined in these words. It had been some time since the  law limiting childbirth had gone into force in China. Chinese  women could give birth to one child, Uighur women up to two,  Kazakh women up to four. The law was one thing. In connection  with the law, it appeared that reduction in female births among  the Chinese was leading to uncertain attitudes. Harm to our  demographic numbers will be observed in the future with the  implementation of the Internationalist policy. The Muslim people  in China thought this aspect [of Chinese policy] a great danger.  Everyone agreed that for a period of 10-15 years there has been  no pressure or harm whatever inflicted on us. However, the  future of our children's children will be restricted. Life  itself has shown them this. During the middle 1960s there was  little movement in the territory of the Ile Kazakh Autonomous  Republic, but now the times are different. With each passing  year the number of people in the interior areas is tilting in  favor the Chinese, and the land is growing narrow, he said. In  some areas Muslim graveyards have been completely destroyed and  large villages build over the top. Thus, all these  manifestations were greatly disturbing our kinsmen in China.    The independence of the Republic was a great joy for them.  If  they did not rejoice more than we, they rejoiced no less. All  those who came brought livestock for slaughtering. They were  agreeable and wished us happiness. Their hope is that Kazakhstan  prospers; that the dispersed Kazakhs will be able to return to  their native land; and that they be allowed to walk in their  native country. In this connection several words of complaint  were uttered unintentionally. They said: We are all happy that  relations between the two countries have been placed on a good  basis. For some unknown reason it is extremely difficult to  establish connections with our own country. The Chinese pass  quickly. They get their documents in good order in no more than  a month. We, on the other hand, get frozen in the ice, and it  takes two-three years. And, if we do anything wrong, that is the  end of it. Thus, our longing for our country becomes grief. Our  attempts do not go forward. In truth, there are those of our  countrymen who find their way going back and forth. However, if  we compare their numbers to those of the Chinese, it is one ear  of wheat in the barley [a drop in the bucket]. For the Chinese  it is nothing special if 50-60 million go to Kazakhstan and then  return. In their [the Chinese Kazakhs] view, there is great  danger in the growth of Chinese numbers in Kazakhstan, and it  seems that in three-four years there will be pressure to turn  Kazakhstan into their [the Chinese] country. They [the Chinese]  are a people who love to work, who endure hunger, and who do not  care about where they live or sleep. If we do not stop the flood  coming to Kazakhstan now, there is no doubt that they will  overcome us in 10-15 years. Our kinsmen in the Ile Kazakh  Autonomous Oblast and the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Rayon are  now suffering this. They greatly emphasized one thing. Those who  come exhausted and hungry recover and begin to get rich in  one-two years. Leaving other things aside, the broad steppes,  the rivers, and the lakes would be very convenient for them. The  wild game and birds, the small animals of the rivers and lakes,  all the various kinds of plants (weed or not) will be put to use  by them without distinction. The steppe and the high snowy  mountains will be ideal for them. For that reason, we must be  very careful about this.    There is nothing wrong with how they speak. They have kept  the Kazakh language pure. The art of the aytys [poets contest]  among them is amazing. Courteous young women and men use words  correctly, and reply to each other with clever expressions. When  they sing to one another it makes you want to listen and listen.  The young people never passed directly in front of the old man.  Whatever the circumstances, the place of honor belongs to the  old man. The dedication of sisters and daughters-in-law, in  particular, to the good of the adult males is completely natural.    The policy for taking them into the Army is altogether  different than with us. That is to say, the population is so  large that only three-four persons among the inhabitants of a  rayon enter the Army. Thus, there are quite a number competing  for these positions, and the ones with the most potential are  accepted.    To draw some final conclusions, it is difficult to express  in  words the love of our Kazakh kinsmen in the Chinese Peoples  Republic for Kazakhstan, their pride and faith in the future.  They rejoice in our achievements and grieve with us in our  failures. In addition to this, they are a people of genuineness  and good intentions who place peace above everything. The  primary hope is to return to their homeland. Ready to use every  opportunity, thinking that their hopes are near fulfillment,  they comfort one another as they send me on my way. May your  hopes be fulfilled, I said returning home.</p>

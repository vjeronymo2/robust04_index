			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / World Trade News: US investors join the east European goldrush - German links with the Midwest have helped win American investment in the former communist bloc AS THE realisation dawns on US companies that the Cold War is truly over, eastern Europe is drawing some of America's largest investing commitments. Americans were not immediately interested as eastern Europe was first developing its bent for capitalism, but, since the break-up of the Soviet Union, they have 'rushed forward' to become the largest investor in the former east bloc, says Mr Mark Dixon, editor of East European Investment Magazine, the New York-based publication that tracks US investment. The disclosed value of US investments in the area in the last quarter of 1991 and the first quarter of 1992 was more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1bn), Mr Dixon adds. But that does not include US investment in east Germany, where, since the privatisation agency Treuhand has concentrated efforts on the US, investment has grown apace. US investment in east Germany stands at over Dollars 1bn, making the US the third largest investor in terms of the value of commitments, including 46 transactions with 32 US companies. Some 120 other companies have set up operations in east Germany through franchises, branch offices or production facilities on greenfield sites. Treuhand's New York office, which opened last November and is its largest outside Germany, has helped more than 200 US companies identify suitable possible acquisitions and led more than 40 of these into serious negotiations. About half of those who reach advanced talks are expected to complete investments. In competing with east European countries for investment dollars, Mr Christoph Urban, head of Treuhand's New York office and a 20-year veteran of Siemens, emphasises Germany's stable social-political environment and strong currency, that Dollars 100bn is being pumped into east German infrastructure, and Treuhand's available subsidies. East Germany, Mr Urban says, is 'a back-door entry' for those who want a foothold in east European markets. US companies that have made investments through Treuhand say their motivation was to capture markets in eastern Europe as well as east Germany. For example, while having plants in the Netherlands and France, Minneapolis-based Medtronic, the world's largest maker of heart pace-makers, acquired the east German pace-maker company Tur, which had supplied the product to the east bloc. Yet, while Treuhand is credited generally with fulfilling its promises and handling negotiations well, US companies say bumps can develop along the way. An official at Illinois Tool Works said that, while Treuhand responded quickly to its initial interest, the agency took 'a long time to come up with a signable agreement'. Only after the company pulled a few political strings in west Germany did it acquire Treuhand's full attention. But it was now happy with its deal. Similarly, Daniel Industries of Houston, a leading maker of metering equipment for gas and oil, found delays when it came to Treuhand clearing up ownership of the land on which its desired acquisition sits and clarifying incentives, particularly regarding training. Other investors have confronted problems, though none apparently so difficult that they have abandoned negotiations. Mr Urban and the others trawling for US investment are especially drawn to the Midwest, the nation's industrial heartland. Key Midwestern industries such as car manufacture, with their extensive supply chains and sophisticated machine tools, are of particular interest to countries seeking to gain industrial strength. Treuhand is also attracted to the Midwest because of the region's large number of German descendants. 'There are strong German links,' Mr Urban says. 'It is said there are 900 German-rooted companies in the Mid-west.' A similar association has been vital for Poland's attraction of US investment. Poland led all its former eastern European allies in attracting US investment during the last quarter of 1991 and the first quarter of 1992. While a detailed breakdown of US outflows to Poland is not available, investment experts believe a sizeable amount comes from Polish Americans, about 1m of them in the Chicago area.</p>

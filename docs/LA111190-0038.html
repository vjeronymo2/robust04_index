			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHE HELPS SOVIET EMIGRES SAY NYET TO OVEREATING  </P> <P> On a recent trip to a local Alpha Beta, 66-year-old Klara Leviant surveyed the  dairy section with surprise. "You mean you can buy cottagecheese?" she marveled  in her native Russian. "I've always made it!"  </P> <P> Leviant, who moved to the United States from the Ukraine about five months ago  and now lives in West Hollywood, was one of several Soviet women taking a tour  of the supermarket under the direction of Klava Cousin, a West Hollywood  registered dietitian. It was a field trip of sorts, offered as part of the  weekly nutrition classes that Cousin, herself a native of Moscow, conducts  exclusively for Soviet Jewish emigres.  </P> <P> During the hour, Cousin, 34, led her charges up and down the aisles, showing  them how to interpret product labels that can be confusing even to consumers  with an excellent command of English, and making recommendations for low-fat  and low-cholesterol foods.  </P> <P> Afterward, Leviant told Cousin that the market was "like a jungle." She had  never seen so much food in her entire life, she added -- not even during 28  years working as a secretary to a Ukrainian inspector of foods and other  products.  </P> <P> The excursion served to illustrate the twofold need that prompted Cousin to  begin her classes several years ago. As a dietitian and native speaker of  Russian, she was uniquely qualified to impart nutritional counsel to fellow  Soviets, most of whom were referred by physicians because of such problems as  obesity, hypertension and diabetes. Second, she could use the classes to  provide an informal education about the American lifestyle, and to help the new  immigrants adjust to their new land.  </P> <P> She draws her student-clients from the estimated 60,000 Soviet Jews who now  make the Los Angeles area their home, with the largest concentrations found in  Hollywood and West Hollywood. About 3,500 have arrived in the last two years,  and 2,000 more are expected in 1991.  </P> <P> "Food isn't just eating -- it's the culture," Cousin said. "It's how you adapt.  If you don't know what something is, you don't touch it. The supermarket tour,  for instance, goes beyond food -- after they take it, there's more  understanding, they start speaking English more."  </P> <P> Cousin, who came to the United States in 1975, married Los Angeles Philharmonic  bass player Jack Cousin five years later and worked as an exercise instructor,  hairdresser and cosmetologist before earning her degree in nutrition in 1985  from Cal State Los Angeles. At the Wednesday afternoon classes for the Soviet  emigres, she draws on her own experiences.  </P> <P> "It took me so long before I started to work toward my degree because I had no  guidance, no one to tell me what to do," she recalled. "I had misconceptions  about college -- people said it was too much money. So now I tell my clients:  Don't wait, go to college or take other courses, learn. Don't stay home with a  Russian paper or radio. Go out, have activities, go to the senior citizens  center. Integrate."  </P> <P> In one recent class, conducted in a mixture of English and Russian, Cousin  focused on the cereal food group. Another class concentrated on meats. She  showed her students how to weigh and measure, cautioned them against misleading  television commercials, and dispelled misconceptions, such as one woman's  belief that bathing twice daily would eliminate excess pounds.  </P> <P> Several clients have a common reason for attending: an almost immediate weight  gain upon arriving from a country where food staples are hard to come by. "When  I first came here, I gained 10 pounds because there were so many foods here,  and I said, 'I'd like this and this and this.' When I'd go to the supermarket,  I'd take everything," recalled Marina Palov, 32, a now-svelte child  psychologist from Leningrad who moved to Hollywood six months ago with her  husband and daughter. Chemical engineer Adele Gordon, 65, joined the class  because of her hypertension, but she experienced a similar weight gain when she  left Moscow two years ago to live with her married son and his family in Los  Angeles. "It was a very, very bad time in Moscow -- there was no meat, cheese  or sausage, and I'd stay in line for two hours for what food there was. I was  amazed at the variety of foods here." Her favorites? "Cereal with milk, turkey  breast and ice cream."  </P> <P> Cousin takes into account food's strong psychological connotations when  deciding upon each client's diet. Of Palov, for instance, she said, "I wouldn't  put her on a liquid diet -- she was deprived enough in Leningrad." But she  allowed 25-year-old Eren Ryaboy to take a medically supervised liquid  supplement. Ryaboy, who has a word processing job in Los Angeles, endured  classmates' teasing and other feelings of displacement when she first moved to  the United States from Kiev as an 11-year-old. She has since become an American  citizen and considers herself thoroughly adjusted to this country's big-city  life.  </P> <P> Even so, Ryaboy, like most of her more recently arrived classmates, socializes  mainly with fellow Soviets. "My husband and I are still connected to the Old  Country," she said.  </P> <P> "Maybe it's unfair to say this," she observed, "but the ones who came here a  long time ago, we feel we are on a higher level than the people who have just  come -- we have houses and careers. The new ones look at us like we're total  jerks -- they think it's harder for them to adjust than it was for us, but it  isn't. They think that money in America falls from the sky, that we didn't have  to work hard for it. Even within families, people don't understand each other  about this."  </P> <P> An informal poll among the class as to the highs and lows of life in Los  Angeles, Soviet-style, revealed a consensus: Like most Angelenos, they all  dislike the smog and crime, but they love the temperate climate and the lack of  discrimination against Jews.  </P> <P> Even those recently arrived have lost no time picking up some American habits.  Luba Popok, fresh from the Ukraine and attending her first nutrition class, had  earlier shyly declined an interview because, she said, she did not speak  English. But when a question about the best thing about L.A. was directed to  the room at large -- in English -- Popok was the first to reply -- also in  English:  </P> <P> "Television," she said.  </P></p>

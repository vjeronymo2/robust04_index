			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Braer report calls for urgent action on shipping: Inquiry finds significant incidence of human error A call for urgent action to cut the chance of human error in shipping and reduce the danger of pollution of the seas was made in an official report published yesterday. Lord Donaldson's inquiry into the prevention of shipping pollution, launched after the sinking of the oil tanker Braer, has made more than 100 recommendations for improved safety procedures. The Braer, a Liberian-registered tanker, spilled 85,000 tonnes of Norwegian oil into the sea off Shetland in January 1993 after sea water entered its diesel tanks and caused engine failure. Responding to the report, Safer Ships, Cleaner Seas, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, announced plans to shame shipowners into raising standards by publishing a monthly list of sub-standard ships calling at UK ports, detailing the names of vessels, their defects, flags and owners. Lord Donaldson and his inquiry team said they 'were surprised and alarmed at the number of potentially serious incidents which took place during the course of the inquiry . . . Although none resulted in major pollution, it was largely a matter of chance that they did not'. The report identified human failings as the cause of virtually all accidental pollution from ships, and said the best preventative measure was improved maintenance and operation standards. Its recommendations include: A tougher system for inspecting ships arriving in port. An increase in the number of tugs around the UK coastline. Improved sharing of information between charterers, insurers, shipping agents and regulatory bodies on the standards of ships and fleets. Substandard ships would then have difficulty finding cargoes and increase their insurance premiums. Better identification of ships at sea by painting their international radio call sign on their sides and decks. The creation of Marine Environmental High Risk Areas, a small number of areas which are both environmentally sensitive and on busy shipping routes. The inquiry said these measures would cost about Pounds 10m with the bill to be shared by the government and shipowners. Mr Frank Dobson, Labour transport spokesman, called for the North Sea states to bring in tough new regulations to enforce better standards because of the failure of the 'flag states' to act. Numast, the ships' officers union, said it was concerned that planned cutbacks at the department of transport's marine safety agency would undermine the inquiry's recommendations.

			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / International Company News: Decision day for Etam shareholders SHAREHOLDERS in Etam, the 250-store women's fashion chain, will today decide whether to accept a tender offer for shares which could lead to a bid valuing the group at about Pounds 120m. The offer of up to 185p per share has been made by Oceana Investment Corporation, a vehicle for the Lewis family which runs the 700-store Foschini chain in South Africa. Oceana already owns a 6.6 per cent stake and could take that to 25.1 per cent. Mr Michael Lewis, a director of Oceana and Foschini, said his organisation was considering making an offer for the whole group, but wanted to gauge shareholder opinion at the maximum price of 185p. The offer is for up to 12.1m shares, 18.5 per cent of the equity, and the outcome depends on the number of shares tendered. At less than 3.2m, the offer will be withdrawn; between 3.2m and 12.1m, the shares will be bought at 185p. Oversubscription will lead to a striking price: shares tendered below it will be bought at that price; tenders at the striking level will be scaled back and those above it will be rejected. Oceana would use this response to put pressure on the Etam board to come to an agreement. Some analysts have recommended that shareholders tender because they believe it will take at least two years for the shares to reach 185p on fundamentals. The offer price compares with 87p in January and 176p on Friday, and is 25 times the earnings recently announced for 1990-91. Gartmore Investment Management, the largest institutional holder, increased its stake from 11.1 to 12.3 per cent on Friday and is unlikely to tender. Mr Vivian Balzalgette, a director, said: 'Oceana has highlighted the investment potential.'</p>

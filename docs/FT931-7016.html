			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / In sight of the summit: Richard Waters says that the current bull run in the world's main bond markets could lose momentum The bull market in bonds around the world has taken a further, dizzying turn in the past fortnight. Bond prices have soared, pushing yields down to levels not seen for more than two decades in the US and UK markets. The Japanese bond market has risen to heights not touched for more than 25 years, save for a three-month interlude in the 1980s. Is this bull market about to run out of steam, or is the world economy as weak as the buyers of bonds seem to believe? Most market observers believe the top of the market may soon be reached. 'We're not there yet - but we're much closer to it than we have been for a long time,' says Mr Gordon Johns, a managing director with Kemper Investment Management, the US fund management company. The argument for buying bonds rests on the economic slump that has afflicted industrialised nations. Without economic growth, companies cannot generate the higher profits and pay the bigger dividends that make investors buy equities. Also, with the slowdown encouraging governments in Japan and the US to cut short-term interest rates to historic lows, investors have had little incentive to leave cash in short-term deposits with banks or in money-market instruments. Result: a rush into bonds. The US bond market has led the surge. The market's bell-wether, the 30-year bond (known as the 'long bond'), hit its highest level since the early 1970s at the start of this week. The yield on the bond tumbled below 7 per cent, encouraged by the economic plan announced by President Bill Clinton in his state of the union address last week. The romance between Mr Clinton and the bond market has been remarkable. Last autumn, the prospect of a Democratic victory in the presidential election for the first time in 17 years seemed a bond investors' nightmare. The market feared the incoming president would bring in measures to stimulate the economy, in the process stoking up inflation and adding to the US fiscal deficit. Mr Clinton's tax-raising and deficit-reducing plan has eased those fears. In the past week, the yield on the long bond has fallen from 7.12 per cent to 6.82 per cent. This suggests a high level of confidence in an untried president, whose ability to push through a tough economic package is still uncertain. The leap in bond prices in Japan has been equally marked. Last summer, the yield on the benchmark government bond No 145 stood comfortably above 5 per cent. An admission by the authorities that the real economy was slowing down sharply after the collapse in property and share prices since the end of the 1980s forced the yield down to 4.5 per cent by the turn of the year. Earlier this week, the yield fell below 4 per cent. The rise of the yen has provoked fears that Japanese exports will become less competitive, further undermining the country's manufacturing sector. Finance minister Mr Yoshiro Hayashi said earlier this week that another reduction in the country's discount rate - cut to just 2.5 per cent earlier this month - could follow. The buying spree in part reflects disillusionment with equities. The Nikkei average is stuck at about 17,000, less than half its peak in 1989, and investors have little confidence that share prices will rise soon. As a result, they have channelled money into bonds. That contrasts with the 1980s bull market, when Japanese bonds rose with the stock market. 'This time, it's the sort of buying you get in a slump,' says Mr Stephen Lewis, an economist at London Bond Broking Company. 'Bonds are simply the least bad investment.' By comparison, Europe's bond market rally seems almost sedate. Nevertheless, the yield on long-dated UK government bonds (gilts) fell below 8 1/2 per cent a fortnight ago, its lowest level since the early 1970s. Can these price rises be sustained? At least three factors suggest that the bond markets are entering testing times, and that further gains depend on a break with recent investment trends. First, real (after-inflation) yields stand at low levels by recent standards. The average real yield of the three main bond markets (the US, Japan and Germany) dropped from 4.6 per cent two years ago to just 2.9 per cent at the start of this year, according to Kemper Investment Management. During the 1980s, real yields averaged 4 per cent. This suggests either that bond investors expect inflation rates to fall further, or that they think the threat of resurgent inflation has receded and are prepared to accept lower real returns. It may be a return to the pre-1970s investment landscape. Before the oil shocks of that decade knocked confidence in low-inflation growth, real returns were noticeably lower (in the 1960s, they averaged 3 per cent). Even on this yardstick, though, the main bond markets have reached testing levels. The second factor restraining bond prices is the relationship be-tween equity and bond yields. The pattern in the UK in the 1980s was for bonds to yield more than twice the level of equities, reflecting the way anticipated inflation benefits equity investors while hitting bond markets. The ratio of bond to equity yields has now fallen below two. In the US, meanwhile, bonds yield about 4 percentage points more than equities, roughly the level they have held for the past three or four years. Bond prices will only rise further if this relationship shifts. That could be about to happen, according to observers such as Mr Lewis. He argues that investors in the US have overly optimistic expectations of earnings growth in US companies as the economy comes out of recession. As their hopes are disappointed, he expects a switch from equities into bonds. However, he adds that this would give only a limited extra lease of life to the bond market because of the historically low level of yields. The third shadow over the bond markets comes from the large overhang of bonds that governments around the world will have to sell this year. Members of the G7 group of leading industrial nations are expected to raise more than Pounds 500bn between them to finance the large budget deficits that have resulted from economic downturn. Borrowing needs of several European countries threaten to outpace the capacity of their domestic bond markets, forcing them to the international bond (Eurobond) market for money. Italy, Sweden and Finland have borrowed internationally this year. This competition for capital could prevent long-term interest rates falling, limiting further gains in bond prices. The combination of these factors is prompting investors to review their exposure to bonds. 'The case for being bullish on bonds is nowhere near as clear as it has been,' says Mr Johns of Kemper Investment Management. Nevertheless, there may still be areas of growth. Markets in Europe where currencies are still tied to the exchange rate mechanism should offer the best hope. High German interest rates have kept European bond yields higher than they would otherwise have been given the slowdown in the European economy. Further easing of the Bundesbank's monetary policy - provided it does not imply a relaxation of Germany's anti-inflationary stance - can only be good for bonds. However, even here prices could have risen too far, too fast. With financial markets anticipating a quick fall in German short-term interest rates, 10-year bonds have fallen sharply this year, nudging below 7 per cent 10 days ago. For the other big markets, the market peak seems even closer. There may be little current risk of an inflationary spiral, sending bond prices crashing. But the world economy will need to take a further lurch towards the abyss if the bull market in bonds is to maintain its recent momentum.</p>

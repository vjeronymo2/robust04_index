			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: German economy Western Germany's inflation rate of 4.5 per cent in April may well prove higher again than the UK's. But on an underlying basis the picture looks rather different. Exclude mortgage payments, which distort the UK headline figure, and the British rate for March is 5.7 per cent. Exclude fuel, which has distorted the German figure since last July's temporary tax increases, and the underlying rate for that country becomes 3.6 per cent. That would seem a clear reason why the UK still needs an interest rate differential - unless, of course, the underlying rates were expected to converge in the foreseeable future. Germany's headline rate will fall sharply in July when the oil taxes drop out of the equation, but the underlying rate looks sticky, not least because wage pressures have pushed service sector inflation up to 5.6 per cent. Not all the 9.7 per cent growth in German money supply reflects distortions arising from unification and D-Mark use by former east bloc countries. German unit labour costs rose at an annual rate of 7.7 per cent in the final quarter of last year: those in the UK were up 4.5 per cent in the three months to February. That largely reflects the UK's lead position in the cycle, however. It is hard to see the underlying rates actually crossing over this year. If they did, there would scarcely be scope for lower UK interest rates, since Germany's would doubtless be higher than they are today.</p>

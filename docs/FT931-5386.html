			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Bonuses cut again WITH-PROFITS pay-outs were cut again this week as four more life companies announced bonuses for the year, writes John Authers. Ten-year pay-outs were cut substantially, while 25-year maturity values - the term most often used for endowment mortgages - were less affected, reflecting the higher proportionate impact which the last few years of mediocre investment performance have had on shorter term policies. Pay-outs include two elements added on to a guaranteed 'sum assured' - reversionary bonuses, added each year, and terminal bonuses, added only when the policy matures. Reversionary bonuses tend to reflect anticipated future returns and have largely withstood cuts thus far, but the pattern for terminal bonuses is more mixed. AXA Equity &amp; Law, which announced a cut in reversionary bonuses in January, has now altered terminal bonuses. Depending on when the policy was started, some terminal bonuses have decreased slightly and others have increased. Assuming monthly premiums of Pounds 30 were paid on an endowment policy started by a 29-year-old man, ten-year pay-outs are cut by 7.3 per cent from Pounds 7,263 to Pounds 6,732, while 25-year maturities fall by 2.6 per cent from Pounds 62,426 to Pounds 60,777. Eagle Star Life made greater cuts, of 12.7 per cent from Pounds 6,896 to Pounds 6,019 for ten-year pay-outs, and of 2.7 per cent from Pounds 61,910 to Pounds 60,188 for 25-year pay-outs. Not all these cuts were because of bonus reductions. In 1983, Eagle Star raised the premiums needed to cover the guaranteed sum assured, which accounts for part of the ten-year pay-out adjustment. Equitable Life cut ten-year endowment pay-outs by 7.6 per cent from Pounds 7,811 to Pounds 7,217, and 25-year pay-outs from Pounds 53,444 to Pounds 53,067. Sun Life cut ten-year pay-outs by 8 per cent from Pounds 7,029 to Pounds 6,467; 25-year pay-outs remained unchanged at Pounds 47,575.</p>

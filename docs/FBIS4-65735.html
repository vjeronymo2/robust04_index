			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Olivier Provost: "Does It Cost Too Much To </F> Defend France?"]    [Text] Less money for guns, and more for weapons to fight  AIDS: That was the phrase sung during an anti-AIDS television  event in response to the money which France spends on defense.  Apart from that, a terse statement from the Ecology Generation  wondered about, among other things, "the government's indulgence  of the arms industry's pressure groups." Setting aside these  discordant notes, public opinion did not react to the 613.118  billion current francs [Fr], which represent Fr658 billion in  constant francs based on an annual inflation rate of 2 percent,  provided for in the military programming law covering the  1995-2000 period. That is half of France's total annual budget.    Should one conclude from this that the French are losing  interest in the issue and that, above certain amounts (the Fr20  billion for the recapitalization of Air France seemed to strike  home a lot more), we are wandering out in the realm of the  abstract? Or does it mean, as some optimistic elected  representatives allege, that as a result of the Bosnian and  Somalian interventions, the French understand completely the  importance of having an optimal national defense and  intervention capacity? The elected representatives hardly  reacted either. Next Tuesday [24 May] evening, and probably  Wednesday too, they are supposed to debate the text. This  presentation is to be preceded by a speech by Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur. The vote itself, as is the case with  important texts, will not take place until a week later.  However, the outcome is already known. It will be positive.    The military planning law could even be marked by the seal  of  consensus. The RPR [Rally for the Republic] -- except for a few  grumblers like Jacques Baumel -- and the UDF [French Democratic  Union] will obviously vote in favor. The Communists will vote  against, as is traditional. The Socialists will vote "yes"  under pressure from President Francois Mitterrand, who will let  it be understood that he is the main instigator behind the text  which he supposedly managed to get "accepted" by the government.    The 1995-2000 military planning law should therefore be  widely adopted, but not necessarily applied, because it has no  legitimacy in terms of substance. At Bercy [Finance Ministry],  they always have trouble getting used to the idea that the  government and the elected representatives are going to commit  themselves to spending over a period of six years.    Budget experts are "completely prepared to take with one  hand  what was given with the other," one deputy commented. It was  with some reluctance that the Finance Ministry agreed to an  annual increase of .5 percent in defense spending -- and even,  beginning in 1998, of 1.5 percent if the economic recovery and  the cost reductions for arms programs materialize -- while the  law on controlling spending calls for each ministry to receive  .5 percent less per year. However, Budget Minister Nicolas  Sarkozy indeed realized that, since Balladur's arrival at the  Matignon [office of the prime minister], the prime minister has  favored [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard with each volley  between the Finance and the Defense ministries. This is a  political choice since Defense was favored in the prime  minister's first speech on general policy. It is also a  politician's choice: His defense minister is also the honorary  president of the Republican Party, which is the UDF's strike  force, and a source of hoped-for support in the 1995  presidential elections, even if it means promising "Leo" the  prime ministership and painting a glowing picture of support  for the presidential elections in 2002.    The 1993 interim budget, the 1994 budget, the financing of  external operations: The Finance Ministry had to defer to the  Defense Ministry, but is not losing anything by waiting. In the  past, the moral validity alone of a programming law did never  withstand annual budget cuts. According to Francois Leotard,  the difference would only be 4.9 percent, but this calculation  is based on the initial finance law. According to a calculation  currently being made in Parliament, after the budget audit, the  gap would reach 20 to 25 percent. The elected representatives  regret seeing their vote in favor of a programming law scorned  by these little cuts based on the principle of the "Huron  curve." That is the name for the financial mechanism whose  program authorization curve starts at a very high level, but  which is systematically being eroded at the lower levels  representing payment credits, or the money that is actually  allocated.    Despite everything, in the year 2000, France will have the  most modern fighter aircraft in the world, the Rafale; a  missile-launching nuclear submarine which can rival those made  by Russia and the United States; a nuclear propulsion aircraft  carrier in a class that only Washington has; an armored division  of Leclerc combat tanks, the newest in Europe; and helicopters,  satellites, missiles. Everything will be new and high-tech. Is  this a stroke of genius or a stroke of madness? It is, first of  all, a sort of "concatenation" logic. The kind that, in the  eighties, first under the Right and then under the Left, made  France simultaneously launch a renewal of all its major armament  programs. Total cost: Fr700 billion!    Not to mention the fact that at the same time we had to  continue equipping our troops with the existing equipment, which  is not included in the total. By the early nineties, it was too  late to stop these major programs. The industrial and social  risk had become too great. Squaring the circle meant keeping  the programs while making savings. The 1995-2000 programming  law tried this tack by encouraging the manufacture of equipment,  by counting on cost reductions of 2 percent, and by postponing  or staggering future programs, since there could be no question  of rewriting the "concatenation" logic. Why 2-percent cost  reductions? Quite simply because there were those among  Francois Leotard's staff who thought they could "fit things in"  over the six-year period with an annual growth of 2.5 percent.  However, such a growth rate is inconceivable at a time when the  Matignon is asking all its ministers to economize. The  .5-percent increase was only won after applying a lot of  pressure that irritated more than just one person at the  Matignon. Two percent was still needed to make the operation  succeed, hence the objective of productivity gains.    The worst thing is that all this is just not enough. So far,  bearing in mind the Fr700 billion that has to be found, the  various governments have always "passed the bucket." Preceding  programming laws definitely provided for a slight progression,  but they did not show the necessary and substantial increases in  spending to finance the actual project cost in the subsequent  years (up 5 percent, up 10 percent, up 12 percent). This is a  time bomb left behind; and one which the planning law for  1995-2000 has not completely defused.    In six years, France will therefore have top quality arms.  There are plenty of geopolitical reasons for this: The  celebrated "peace dividends," mentioned by Laurent Fabius  following the fall of the Berlin Wall, have given way to a great  many fears. Is France at risk of one day being hit by a nuclear  missile from Ukraine? From Belarus? A SCUD from Algeria? A  chemical bomb from the Balkans? Not to mention the threat of  terrorism, nuclear proliferation, etc.    The white paper, which was drawn up just before the  programming law, reviews all possible crises. France must  therefore combine maintaining its deterrent force with  developing its capacity to project its forces via helicopters,  future troop transport aircraft, landing craft, and even Cruise  missiles. It is a sort of compromise between Desert Storm and  the Cold War, an attempt to, at a price, maintain the armaments  industry with its 230,000 employees throughout France and its  technological skills, which are often the best in Europe.    However, the main reason for these Fr613 billion over six  years may lie elsewhere. France has a seat on the Security  Council and is fighting to get its voice heard everywhere in the  worldwide diplomatic chorus, starting in Bosnia, where it has  more soldiers than other nations, to Cambodia. "It is not the  Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] that allows France to keep this  place," an RPR senator said with regard to these strategic  questions, "it is the weight of its Army, its capacity,  independent of the United States, to intervene militarily.  Without its Armed Forces, France would be relegated to the rank  of second-class nation." So Paris has every reason in the world  to put more than Fr600 billion into this programming law:  political consensus, disinterest -- but not hostility -- from  public opinion, a geostrategic key, the industrial and social  imperative, and technological necessity.    This will remain true until the next annual budget debate.  Even in the government, they will then realize that one Leclerc  tank costs Fr30 million, one fully equipped Rafale fighter plane  Fr588 million, and a nuclear aircraft carrier Fr17 billion. How  many schools, kilometers of freeway, or how much AIDS research  could all that buy? Questions of choice and priority, or even  of demagogy will inevitably arise throughout the six years  covered by the programming law.</p>

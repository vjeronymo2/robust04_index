			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Costain to pay Hanson Dollars 5m compensation fee COSTAIN, the construction group, is required to pay a Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.2m) compensation fee to Hanson after it cancelled an agreement to sell its Australian coal-mining business to Peabody, a Hanson subsidiary. According to a circular to Costain shareholders, the payment is a termination fee and liquidated damages agreed with Peabody in the event that sale was not completed. Costain cancelled the agreement to sell the mining business for Dollars 200m after it received a Dollars 245m offer from Altus Finance. The payment is not linked with the legal dispute between Costain and Peabody concerning abandonment of the deal. Peabody, which began legal action in the US on November 10 is alleging Costain sought the offer from Altus and breached its agreement by negotiating with Altus. On November 16, Costain started proceedings in London against Peabody, seeking a declaration that it was entitled to negotiate with Altus. The shareholders' circular also revealed that the company's net debt at October 30 has increased from Pounds 172.4m to Pounds 340.4m since the end of 1991. A substantial part of this increase resulted from refinancing of the group's share of borrowings of Spitalfields Holdings, the joint venture company owned by Costain, BICC and London &amp; Edinburgh Trust. This resulted in Pounds 56.1m of borrowings coming onto the group's balance sheet.</p>

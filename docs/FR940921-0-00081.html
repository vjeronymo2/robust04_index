			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 25. Section 86.094&hyph;24 of subpart A is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(5), (a)(6) introductory text, (a)(12), (a)(13) introductory text, (a)(14) introductory text and (a)(15), by removing ``; and'' from the end of paragraph (a)(13)(i) and adding a period in its place, and by adding paragraphs (a)(6)(iv) and (a)(13)(iii), to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;86.094&hyph;24  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Test vehicles and engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks covered by an application for certification will be divided into groupings (e.g., by fuel type) which are expected to have similar evaporative emission characteristics throughout their useful life. Each group of vehicles with similar evaporative emission characteristics shall be defined as a separate evaporative emission family.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) For light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks to be classed in the same evaporative emission family, vehicles must be similar with respect to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iv) Fuel type.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (12) Vehicles powered by heavy-duty engines covered by an application for certification and using fuels for which there is an applicable evaporative emission standard will be divided into groupings of vehicles on the basis of physical features, including fuel type, which are expected to affect evaporative emissions. Each group of vehicles with similar features shall be defined as a separate evaporative emission family.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (13) For vehicles equipped with heavy-duty engines using fuels for which there are applicable evaporative emission standards to be classed in the same evaporative emission family, vehicles must be identical with respect to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii) Fuel type.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (14) For vehicles equipped with heavy-duty engines using fuels for which there are applicable evaporative emission standards to be classed in the same evaporative emission control system family, vehicles must be identical with respect to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (15) Where vehicles equipped with heavy-duty engines using fuels for which there are applicable evaporative emission standards and which cannot be divided into evaporative emission family-control system combinations based on the criteria listed above, the Administrator will establish evaporative emission family-control system combinations for those vehicles based on features most related to their evaporative emission characteristics.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

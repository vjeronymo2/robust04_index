			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> THE DROUGHT RATIONING;  </P> <P> STUDY SHOWS HOW TO END WATER SHORTAGE  </P> <P> The city of Ventura's strict water rationing policy could be relaxed as early  as next January if a plan to tap into unused ground-water supplies goes as  scheduled, city officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> A city-commissioned study on short-term water sources shows that the city could  make up its 4,000 acre-foot water shortfall by purchasing water from the Alta  Mutual Water Co. and from an agricultural well, and by adding a well to its  golf course reservoir on the east end of the city.  </P> <P> Officials said the new water will allow them to lift the building moratorium  and the limits on daily water consumption imposed in April after a four-year  drought dried up the Ventura River, which used to be the east end's main  source.  </P> <P> "I think that we can lift the water rationing restrictions by January of 1991,"  Mayor Richard Francis said Tuesday. "That may be optimistic, but I like  optimism."  </P> <P> City Manager John Baker added, "There might be some relaxation of the water  rationing. But it depends on the rainfall and the timing of these new water  sources being available."  </P> <P> Glenn McPherson from Boyle Engineering Corp. told the council Monday that its  recently completed study showed that the Ventura River's 4,000 acre-foot  shortfall could be made up by the end of the year.  </P> <P> By then, he said, the city could be operating a new golf course well that would  yield 2,000 acre-feet of water a year, and it could be connected to an Alta  Mutual well yielding 2,400 acre-feet a year and an agricultural well yielding  400 acre-feet a year.  </P> <P> "And these are conservative estimates," McPherson told the council. "We could  probably come up with more water." An acre-foot of water typically takes care  of the yearly water needs of a family of four.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Cathy Bean, a member of the city's ad-hoc water committee that is  responsible for overseeing the water study, said the results are encouraging.  </P> <P> "We would probably ease the restrictions on water use and allow some  development," she said. The water rationing ordinance imposed a moratorium on  all new water hookups in the city, bringing development to a virtual  standstill.  </P> <P> Vice Mayor Donald Villeneuve, who is also an ad-hoc water committee member,  said he would wait for the early spring rainfall before relaxing restrictions.  </P> <P> "If we have a normal rain season, then it would be reasonable to relax the  ordinance, but we wouldn't do it until April," he said.  </P> <P> However, city officials cautioned that the Boyle study only identifies  emergency short-term supplies and that some conservation efforts will have to  continue until the city adopts a permanent, long-term solution such as hooking  up to the State Water Project or building a desalination plant. Either project  would take years to complete.  </P> <P> "The danger with this report is that people might seize on it in the most  optimistic fashion and say 'We're home free,' " Villeneuve said.  </P> <P> Other city officials, still concerned with overdrafting Ventura's depleted  aquifers, said they would oppose any significant changes in the water  ordinance.  </P> <P> "I would only support a minimal relaxation of the ordinance when the new water  becomes available," Councilman Todd Collart said. "I would still try to  maintain a basic threshold of 294 gallons a day for single-family homes and 196  gallons for multifamily homes."  </P> <P> But the city could liberalize by allowing more exemptions for water users who  can demonstrate that water rationing is causing them undue hardship.  </P> <P> Councilman John McWherter said he would oppose any easing of water use  restrictions until the city's long-term problems are resolved.  </P> <P> "Until we replenish our aquifers, I would certainly not vote for lifting any  water restrictions," he said.  </P> <P> "The good news is that the water crisis is not going to get worse, not that the  crisis is over."  </P></p>

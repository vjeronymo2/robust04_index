			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR  </P> <P> In your editorial describing Gen. Maxwell Thurman's congressional testimony on  the Salvadoran war ("The General Lays It on the Line," Feb. 12), one sentence  jumps out as absolutely absurd. After citing military assessments that, despite  massive U.S. military aid, the Salvadoran war is at a stalemate and cannot be  won, you conclude: "That's why, when Congress votes to renew that aid -- as it  is likely to do very soon -- it must add conditions . . . to let Cristiani  negotiate peace."  </P> <P> Can someone please explain how renewing military aid leads to peace?  </P> <P> Ten years ago, Archbishop Oscar Romero wrote to President Carter pleading not  to send military aid to his country. His letter was ignored. In 10 years this  country has sent $4 billion and what has it bought? A stalemated war. Romero's  assassination. Continued military attacks on civilians. Generals beyond the  control of civilian and judicial authority. More dead priests.  </P> <P> If President Bush wants to strengthen the hand of his friend Cristiani, the  best way is to cut off military aid and to place strict conditions on other  aid. I bet I'm not the only one who can think of better uses for $1 million per  day right here in Los Angeles. Let the Salvadoran generals find someone else to  buy their bullets and bombs.  </P> <P> CHRISTINE BERARDO  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BAND DIRECTOR A LONG WAY FROM THUNDER BAY  </P> <P> So, just how did a Jewish kid like Paul Shaffer from decidedly un-hip Thunder  Bay, Ontario, Canada, become one of the hippest cats in America?  </P> <P> As the lovable nebbish who is David Letterman's band director on "Late Night"  tells it, it was the drifting of radio airwaves across the border from the  United States to Canada.  </P> <P> "There was nothing much going on for a kid at that time, except for a lot of  cold, bad weather. When I discovered that I could tune into American radio  stations after dark, this was the hippest thing to me. It sort of saved my  life."  </P> <P> Specifically, Shaffer, who has headed Letterman's four-piece band for the eight  years that "Late Night" has been on the air, said the music from stations in  Chicago and Little Rock, Ark., were instrumental in his musical appreciation.  After playing keyboards with local nightclub bands in Thunder Bay, Shaffer  landed a job playing piano in the Broadway musical, "The Magic Show."  </P> <P> Howard Shore, then musical director of "Saturday Night Live," hired Shaffer to  play in the show's band. He also saw some acting time on "SNL," doing an  impersonation of music impresario Don Kirchner and acting as accompanist in  Bill Murray's lounge singer numbers.  </P> <P> Shaffer served as music director for "The Blues Brothers" band for their  national tour and two albums. He has also recorded with artists as diverse as  Diana Ross, Yoko Ono and Bonnie Tyler, as well as serving as co-writer of the  Weather Girls' "It's Raining Men." But it is clear that Shaffer's largest share  of fame has been derived as Letterman's second banana, a role he clearly  relishes. "I'm pretty realistic. It's not a musical show. It's not my show,  where I could show off my band. We've all had a pretty gratifying experience."  </P> <P> Indeed. Shaffer's first solo album, "Coast to Coast," a sort of tour of  American popular musical styles, has done well, and the "Late Night" theme,  which Shaffer included on the album reluctantly, has been nominated for a  Grammy award.  </P> <P> David Letterman is profiled in today's Calendar, F1.  </P></p>

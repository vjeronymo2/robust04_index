			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Arthur Wood rises to Pounds 119,000 Arthur Wood &amp; Son (Longport), maker of earthenware, beakers and terracotta teapots, reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 76,882 to Pounds 119,134 for the year to end-December. The improvement was achieved on turnover up by 6.9 per cent to Pounds 3.58m (Pounds 3.34m) and was struck after a fall in net interest receivable to Pounds 11,964 (Pounds 25,387) and abortive takeover costs of Pounds 69,100. Mr Anthony Wood, chairman, said the main feature of the past six months had been the very strong growth in export sales, which had increased by 48.6 per cent from Pounds 498,511 to Pounds 740,895, representing 20.7 per cent (14.9 per cent) of total sales. Disappointingly, the home market had remained flat, he said. Earnings per share emerged at 4.9p (2.79p) and the single dividend for the year is doubled to 3p.</p>

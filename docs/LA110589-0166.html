			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAINTING PERESTROIKA;  </P> <P> 10 + 10: CONTEMPORARY SOVIET AND AMERICAN PAINTERS EDITED BY VIKTOR MISLANO,  JOHN E. BOWLT ET AL (HARRY N. ABRAMS/AURORA PUBLISHERS, LENINGRAD, IN  ASSOCIATION WITH THE MODERN ART MUSEUM OF FORT WORTH: $39.95; 170 PP.,  ILLUSTRATED; 0-810901668-1)  </P> <P> 10 + 10 does not always add up to 20! Here is a case where the sum is much  greater. The catalogue "10 + 10: Contemporary Soviet and American Painters" is  more than a new publishing project for American and Soviet cultural  cooperation, more than back-up material for the exhibition that started its  intercultural tour in May this year at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth.  This is an invaluable book on the most recent trends in American and Soviet  painting, displaying only artwork by painters under 40.  </P> <P> Assembling the show and catalogue in both Russian and English, the large,  Soviet-American team of exhibition directors, curators, catalogue editors,  translators and painters (10 Americans, 10 Soviets) is, regrettably, too  numerous to mention by name. The entire intercultural venture is described in  penetrating essays by Viktor Mislano, curator of art at Moscow's Pushkin  Museum, and John E. Bowlt, a professor of Slavic Studies at USC and one of  America's top experts on avant-garde Russian art.  </P> <P> A first glance at this attractive catalogue leaves one wondering whether the  reader's attention will be as symmetrical as the American and Soviet paintings.  For one obvious reason, the American painters surely are at a disadvantage.  While Americans know little about new Soviet painting (indeed, the same could  be said, until very recently, of the Soviets!), they will be especially drawn  to the Russian paintings for the way they turn our few preconceived notions  inside out. These cliches range from ugly Socialist Realism (with its  trademark, the gigantic working couple armed with their inevitable props, the  hammer and sickle) to the Russian avant-garde, as yet unsurpassed (with its  trademark, Malevic's famed black square).  </P> <P> A second glance at the catalogue and the biographies of represented artists  enhances first impressions. The Soviet painters are more aggressive, more  impassioned in texts they have written to accompany their paintings, while the  American writing is more subdued. At first it seems as if the Americans are  playing the cordial hosts, doing everything they can to make their guests feel  at home and do their best. But in all fairness, the literary expressiveness of  the young Soviet painters is as much a reflection of a traditional culture  dominated by the Word as it is an expression of the artists' youthful  verbosity. Whatever the case, these texts are intriguing and often crucial to  an understanding of the paintings.  </P> <P> Yurii Albert, author of the "manifesto" paintings "I Am Not Jasper Johns" and  "I Am Not Baselitz," feels that "the place of each work of art is defined by  its correspondence to other works." Vladimir Mironenko insists, within the  Soviet context, on the uniqueness of recent Soviet art ("A new Soviet  civilization has come into being"). Andrei Roiter works with signs ("In trying  to express my sense of time I make use of an 'alphabet' of topical signs,  structuring a sort of pseudo-universal plastic language").  </P> <P> The word "sign" appears frequently, used as well by Anatolii Zhuravlev  ("Everything -- or almost everything -- is a sign, a symbol, or a system of  signs"). Konstantin Zvezdochetov, a true child of the postmodern age,  demonstrates a self-deprecating exhibitionism and a talent for mystification  ("I, Konstantin Zvezdochetov, am a member of a secret organization, the Black  Faculty").  </P> <P> A third glance at the artwork displayed in the catalogue destroys all  preconceptions and brings one to the startling conclusion that artistic  discoveries and dialogue in the two countries are remarkably similar despite  geographical distances and disparities between cultures and political systems.  If someone were to switch the signatures under many of these paintings, the  reader might find it hard to pinpoint the "Soviet" or "American" qualities of  each piece. How could this be so after the isolation that has shrouded Soviet  art for so many years? Is Moscow slated to become a new metropolis in the art  world?  </P> <P> The paintings of the young Soviet painters come from an alternative,  underground culture that has been evolving for several decades in opposition to  official culture, gaining cultural legitimacy only two or three years back.  Returning to the tradition of the Russian avant-garde, yet rejecting it,  imitating Western models while repudiating them, Soviet alternative culture has  survived in a state of isolation bereft of markets, shows, museum status -- and  in the process it has forged an artistic language all its own.  </P> <P> In constant defiance of ruling aesthetic and ideological norms, the collective  underground life of painters, writers and artists ultimately produced truly  original artistic forms, genres, directions, groups, poetics ("soc-art,"  "apt-art," "conceptualist actions") and artistic figures such as Ilya Kabakov,  Erik Bulatov and Komar and Melamid.  </P> <P> By the '70s, these artists had mastered soc-art, their own, authentic voice.  The youngest Soviet artists absorbed the soc-art aesthetic, ranging in their  approach from a more "literary" version (Bulatov, Kabakov) to the  political-grotesque (Komar and Melamid), the political poster (Alexander  Kossolapov, who signs Lenin's name as author of the slogan "Coca-Cola Is the  Real Thing") and intermedia.  </P> <P> Because of their new voice, young Soviet artists are now able to articulate the  ideological context of everyday life, participating in the international  artistic community on an equal footing with artists from other countries. This  allows us to compare Vladimir Mironenko and Peter Halley, Alexei Sundukov and  April Gornik, Yurii Albert and Mark Tansey, Leonid Purygin and David Bates,  Konstantin Zvezdochetov and Annette Lemieux. The only unanswered question is  whether their similarity is one of resemblance or of difference, whether  Vladimir Mironenko is right in saying, "I would like to know how our enormous  country, existing, as it were, in a different dimension, fits in with what is  happening in the rest of the world. What kind of art can it produce? One  bearing only a superficial resemblance to art created in the West, its content  is by now completely different. This is not a continuation of the Russian  avant-garde traditions of the turn of the century. It is already something new,  purely Soviet in origin and intent."  </P> <P> Whatever the case, here is my advice: See for yourself how 10 + 10 add up,  catch the show while it is open in San Francisco, Buffalo, Milwaukee or  Washington, where the American tour of "10 + 10" ends in June, 1990.  </P> <P> If you can't see it then, don't miss it in Moscow, Tbilisi or Leningrad, where  the show finally will close in November of 1990. If all else fails, at least  you should order the catalogue. Come to think of it, order it anyway. "It's the  real thing," in Lenin's immortal words.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISH REPORT: OUTDOORS;  </P> <P> 'BIRD MONTH' AT LAKE CACHUMA  </P> <P> With intermittent strong winds and water levels fluctuating, freshwater fishing  is hit and miss in some Southland waters, but there are alternatives.  </P> <P> Lyle Lape says February is "bird month" at Lake Cachuma, north of Santa  Barbara, with tours scheduled Wednesday through Sunday to see bald eagles,  Canada geese and osprey. Reservations: (805) 508-2460.  </P> <P> Despite a low water level, there also are plenty of fish in the lake, without  many anglers.  </P> <P> LAKE CACHUMA -- With water low, launching ramp away from marina tackle shop, so  top bass anglers not reporting. Heavy plant of 5,700 half-pound trout last  week. Low pressure. Catfish slow.  </P> <P> LAKE PIRU -- Trout fishing best bet, trolling red core line or monofilament 18  to 20 feet deep, using anything in a rainbow lure pattern. Still-fishing in San  Felicia Cove is good, using Velveeta. Bass slow. Catfish active by dam, fishing  deep with mackerel.  </P> <P> PUDDINGSTONE RESERVOIR -- Lures best for trout -- Super Dupers and crappie  jigs, smoked silver flake. Most trout in sailboat-swim area. Roy Eves of San  Dimas caught 20- and 32-pound carp on corn. Bass in deep water.  </P> <P> LAKE MEAD -- Still catching a few stripers on frozen anchovies in Gypsum Wash,  otherwise slow.  </P> <P> LAKE HAVASU -- Spotty. Most stripers 40 to 60 feet deep, but will go for frozen  anchovies or live shad, vertical jigging with Hopkins spoon.  </P> <P> BULLHEAD CITY -- Some trout biting in the river on Power Bait, a few stripers  on lake with Sassy Shad Rat-L-Trap.  </P> <P> SALTON SEA -- Trolling on north shore with Thin Fin lures in afternoon good for  corvina averaging seven pounds. Croaker picking up at Bombay Beach, also  talapia on Johnson Creek, with nightcrawlers.  </P> <P> LAKE CASITAS -- Bass spotty, but Andy Wahrenbrock, La Crescenta, caught a 12  1/2-pounder on a crawdad. Catfish steady and good, going for mackerel at 30  feet. Leonard Gibson, Oak View, caught one 12 pounds, 3 ounces. Trollers  getting nice trout at 10 feet, with Power Bait and Needlefish lures. A few  crappie, including one of 3 1/4 pounds caught by Jim Hollis, Ojai, on a  mini-jig.  </P> <P> LAKE CASTAIC -- Gene L. George, Granada Hills, six-pound bass with plastic worm  on upper lake from boat.  </P> <P> IRVINE LAKE -- Mark Valencia, Tustin, had five trout totaling 10 pounds, using  Rooster Tail. Jaime Duenas, Santa Ana, took a 5 1/2-pound trout on Power Bait,  on west shore. Samuel Liebmann, Corona, took two three-pound trout on old  crocodile lure. Best spots are west shore, Sierra Cove and along buoy line.  </P> <P> LAKE SKINNER -- Looking better as water level rises, allowing Ramp 2 to open.  Water temperature cooling but northern largemouth bass still active. Onessis  Timoteo, Glendale, caught a four-pounder with a nightcrawler at spillway. Jerry  Allen, Huntington Beach, got a 7 3/4- and 3.2-pounders using a jig and pork  rind in second cove from marina. Trout hitting salmon eggs and Power Bait.  </P> <P> LAKE SILVERWOOD -- Lots of largemouths, and Ken East, San Bernardino, took a  20-pound striper with homemade lures by dam. Crews building fish habitat  structures on shore while water down, but new influx will bring level up.  </P> <P> PYRAMID LAKE -- Bob Chertcoff, Los Angeles, caught a 17-pound striper, using a  Big Mac. Alan Wensman, Long Beach, had stripers of 8 1/4 and 10 1/2, with  nightcrawlers on two-pound test line in marina. Hugo Arana, Panorama City, had  a 3 1/3-pound largemouth on nightcrawler. Lots of limits of trout.  </P> <P> LAKE PERRIS -- Pressure light as lake refills. Bass are nearly 60 feet deep  near inlet, feeding on nutrients coming in. Some bass to 15-inch minimum.  </P></p>

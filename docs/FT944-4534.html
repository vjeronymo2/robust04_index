			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Japan advised to buy US aircraft A Japanese defence panel has recommended that the government buy nine US-made aircraft, costing Y30bn (Dollars 300m), despite objections from French and Canadian competitors. If the government follows the panel's advice, this will fuel foreign allegations that Japan's tradition of buying most of its military hardware from the US reflects a desire to reduce trade tensions rather than open its defence market to the best bid. The multipurpose aircraft are for transporting senior air force staff and supporting military exercises. Ministers had planned to choose this week, but remain divided, for both political and technical reasons, over the merits of the rival aircraft - the US Gulfstream, the French Dassault Falcon 900 and Canada's Challenger 601. The previous coalition government had decided to buy the Gulfstream, but the Liberal Democratic party demanded a review after taking power in June. A letter from Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, urging Japan to consider the Falcon 900, gave the new government another reason to review the decision. Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, minister for international trade and industry, who takes a tough line on US trade relations, is one influence in the review. Another is Mr Yohei Kono, foreign minister, who suggests the order be split between the US and French suppliers. The panel of three private sector military experts was set up in an attempt to defuse foreign criticisms of procurement decisions. The panel's report said the Gulfstream performed better and was cheaper to maintain while the purchase prices of the Gulfstream and Falcon were similar. It said the Canadian Challenger did not satisfy technical requirements for take-off, but Mr Donald Campbell, Canadian ambassador to Japan, disputed this.</p>

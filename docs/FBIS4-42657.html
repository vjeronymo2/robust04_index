			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial by Bjorn Mansson: "Risks Posed by New </F> Presidential Role"]    [Text] The presidency requires a certain authority that the  officeholder should safeguard in order to guarantee the  confidence capital that he may need, Bjorn Mansson writes in a  commentary on an editorial that appeared in HELSINGIN SANOMAT  yesterday. He also discusses President Ahtisaari's travel  schedule.    Yesterday our colleague, HELSINGIN SANOMAT (HS), discussed  the risks and problems that may be associated with President  Martti Ahtisaari's view of the presidential role (see press  excerpt above).    HS is right in questioning the very basis for this view;  that  the fact that the president is now elected directly by the  people fundamentally alters his role and his exercise of power.    Under the new election method a president must  receive over half the votes in the second round of voting.  However, Ahtisaari received only a quarter of the votes in the  first "open" round, which can be compared with the fact that  Mauno Koivisto's electoral candidates received 43 percent in  1982 and that Koivisto won almost 50 percent of the direct votes  in 1988!    Nor can Ahtisaari's "popular" mandate be regarded as  stronger  than that of Urho Kekkonen in 1968, for example, when his  election alliance gathered two-thirds of the votes -- not to  mention 1978, when they got over 80 percent!    On the other hand, there is nothing intrinsically wrong in  President Ahtisaari getting out among the people once a month  through visits to various parts of the country, even if the  arrangement smacks of a "royal tour" and of allowing the people  to "petition the highest authority," which belongs historically  to the time of the monarchy.    But there is an inherent risk in this system that the  citizens will get the mistaken idea that the president will set  things right as long as he becomes acquainted with everyday  problems out among the people.    Another risk, that exaggerated populism may damage the  president's authority, is being discussed in the United States,  where President Bill Clinton has gone in for similar "town  meetings" with voters around the country.    However, HS confuses the ideas somewhat when the paper  appears to argue that domestic trips as such lead the president  to take more stands and answer questions. Of course the  president can take such stands and provide answers no matter  where he is -- for example, at regular news conferences, which  are an inherent part of an open democracy.    On the other hand, HS is right in saying that it will be  difficult in the long run if the president intervenes too much  in controversial domestic policy issues. If he does there is a  clear risk that he will no longer be able to stand above the  parties and daily politics in the way the presidential role  requires.    Therefore a certain restraint can be recommended, simply to  enable the president to safeguard the confidence capital he may  need in times of real national crisis.    However, we should not emulate HS and rule out the  possibility that, for example, the national aid package for the  European Union (EU) agreement may develop into an  issue where the president could play a certain role in creating  a national consensus.    But HS is right in saying that the president could be more  careful about selecting the forums in which he appears. HS is  obviously thinking of the MTV program where Ahtisaari was  confronted with some totally disrespectful questions. However,  that concerned fulfilling a somewhat spontaneous promise from  the election campaign.    Here another parallel could be drawn with President Clinton  who had to answer a question about what kind of underpants he  wears on a TV program.    The presidency implies a certain authority that the  officeholder should safeguard.    Furthermore, foreign policy is and will remain the  president's most important domain. At present there is nothing  to criticize, aside from the initially somewhat varied  explanations of the notorious bandage incident [reference to  minor injury sustained] in Stockholm.    It was natural that the first state visit would be to  Sweden.  Two neighboring countries are still awaiting their turn; Russia  and Estonia.    The fact that Ahtisaari visited Iceland, the other Republic  in the Nordic group, before the remaining monarchies has its  natural explanation in the celebration of the 50th anniversary  of Iceland's independence.    That the remaining neighbor, Norway, will have to wait until  October, after Denmark in September, is undoubtedly more than  "made up for" by the fact that Ahtisaari has relatives in Norway.    The upcoming trip to South Africa for the inauguration of  its  new president, Nelson Mandela, is also quite justified. Finland  has every reason to highlight its presence at the historic event  when South Africa's international isolation is definitively  ended.    Moreover, the trip certainly fits the picture of a president  with an international, in fact global, orientation. Ahtisaari  has every reason to maintain the personal relations with a state  that could play a leading role on the African continent that he  formed during the time he was in Namibia.    And even though in general the prime minister should  represent us at EU summit meetings in the future if we become a  member, it is quite fitting that the president should also  attend the summit on Corfu at which our EU agreement will be  signed this summer.</p>

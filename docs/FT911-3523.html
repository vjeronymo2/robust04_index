			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / BBC to shed 720 network TV jobs THE BBC is to shed 720 jobs from its network television operation in London this year as part of its cost-cutting programme and the need to source a higher proportion of programming from independent producers. The job losses, affecting nearly one in 10 network television employees, are intended to save Pounds 14.5m a year. The BBC needs a Pounds 25m cut in the costs of its network television operation by 1993. The scheme involves closing two of the BBC's best-known studios: Television Theatre, the Edwardian variety hall on Shepherd's Bush Green where the Wogan chat show is filmed; and Lime Grove, where arts and current affairs programmes, including the Late Show, are produced. The BBC plans to shed as many jobs as possible through early retirement and freezing recruitment but some redundancies will be unavoidable. The job losses will be concentrated in programme resource departments such as design and graphics, but will also affect administration. The Funding the Future plan is designed to save Pounds 75m across its operations by 1993. The BBC recently announced more than 100 job losses in news and current affairs and 114 in engineering. The cuts in network TV, one of the largest parts of the BBC employing 7,750 of its 25,000 staff, employees, are also a reflection not only of Funding the Future but of the need to satisfy government demands to commission more independent programming. The cuts also reflect a government demand that the ITV network and the BBC must source at least 25 per cent of programmes from independent producers from 1993. Mr Will Wyatt, managing director designate of BBC Network Television, said yesterday that the job losses were the result of a 'double squeeze' on the division.</p>

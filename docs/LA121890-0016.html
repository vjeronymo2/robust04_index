			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES: PS GROUP REMOVES HURDLE FOR BERKSHIRE STOCK PURCHASE  </P> <P> PS Group has modified its anti-takeover defense to clear the way for Berkshire  Hathaway Inc. to acquire up to 45% of the San Diego-based company.  </P> <P> Omaha, Neb.  </P> <P> -based Berkshire Hathaway, which serves in part as an investment vehicle for  investor Warren E. Buffet, now owns 22.1% of PS Group's shares.  </P> <P> PS Group's board of directors on Friday modified corporate bylaws that  prohibited Buffet from acquiring more than 22.5% of PS Group's shares.  </P> <P> However, Berkshire Hathaway, which has indicated that it will seek additional  PS Group shares, won't be able to acquire more than 25% of PS Group's common  shares until after the Federal Trade Commission reviews possible antitrust  considerations.  </P> <P> According to a prepared statement released by PS Group, Berkshire Hathaway's  future acquisitions of the company's shares "will depend on price, market  conditions, availability of funds and Berkshire's evaluation of other  investment opportunities."  </P> <P> Berkshire, which holds large shares in Capital Cities/ABC Inc., Washington Post  Co., GEICO Corp. and other companies, is known to be a largely passive  investor. Buffet has agreed not to sell his PS Group shares to a hostile  bidder, not to wage a proxy contest to oust PS Group's board and not to oppose  the company's board, according to PS Group Vice President Larry Guske.  </P> <P> PS Group is an aircraft leasing and holding company that owns controlling  interests in USTravel Systems Inc., a travel management company, and Recontek  Inc., which recycles metallic hazardous wastes.  </P></p>

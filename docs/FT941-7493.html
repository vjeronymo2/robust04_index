			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Wembley's asset sales expected soon Wembley, the greyhound track operator and owner of the famous London stadium, is expected to sell two of its largest assets this week to comply with a banking deadline to cut borrowings by Pounds 40m, writes Tim Burt. Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman, is understood to be completing negotiations in the US to dispose of the Lincoln Greyhound track in Rhode Island and Pacer Cats, the computer ticketing company. The sale of Pacer Cats, which produces and services ticket computer systems in North America and Europe, is expected to raise about Pounds 20m, taking the disposal programme within 5 per cent of the total repayments due by March 31. Although the moves will significantly reduce Wembley's net debt - put at Pounds 139m at the interim stage last year - lenders, led by Barclays, have also demanded repayment of a further Pounds 10m by the end of the year. Concerned at gearing levels, which touched almost 80 per cent last year, the banks are expected to force more disposals. Industry analysts yesterday predicted that the group would have to sell some of its remaining greyhound tracks in Britain and the US. 'There are more disposals to come. Even if Wembley meets the bank deadlines they will still be quite highly geared,' said one analyst. Speaking from the US, Sir Brian admitted: 'The group is just treading water. Until we finish the disposals programme we cannot embrace new business plans.' Those plans centre on developing its arena management business and signing new advertising contracts for its flagship asset, Wembley stadium. Moves to sign new advertising deals have, however, prompted a row with the Football Association, which has a 20-year contract with Wembley to stage all of its major domestic soccer fixtures and international matches at the north London site. Under the contract, signed in 1982, Wembley receives between 25 and 32 per cent of ticket sales and 25 per cent of television revenue, but retains complete control of perimeter advertising. The FA, which wants to renegotiate the agreement, has been angered by a deal signed by Wembley last month with Sports and Outdoor Media, the international advertising agency which already handles the Melbourne Cricket Ground and Lord's. Mr Tim Crow, sales director at the agency, said it hoped to sign advertising agreements with 10 international corporations, which would be designated 'official sponsors' for all events at Wembley. 'In perimeter advertising, nothing like this has yet been achieved in the UK. We're not selling soccer, we're selling Wembley stadium,' he said. The FA, which is in arbitration with Wembley, is understood to regard the scheme as a threat to its own plans to win new sponsors for English football.</p>

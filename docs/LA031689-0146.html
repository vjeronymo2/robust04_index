			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRUSTEE'S FOES SUBMIT SIGNATURES FOR RECALL VOTE  </P> <P> Organizers of a recall effort aimed at Oxnard School District trustee Jack  Fowler said they had collected enough signatures by Tuesday's deadline to force  an election.  </P> <P> The group, which includes parents and teachers, has given Ventura County  election officials petitions bearing 8,400 to 9,000 signatures, at least 1,000  more than required to force a recall election, organizers said.  </P> <P> "If everything holds, we've got him," said Mark Prim, a junior high school  teacher and an official in the Oxnard Educators Assn.  </P> <P> The teachers union, which represents the district's 486 teachers, spearheaded  the recall after becoming deadlocked with the district in contract negotiations  late last year.  </P> <P> Union members characterized Fowler, who has been on the board for 15 years, as  a domineering and insensitive trustee who manipulates the board.  </P> <P> They hoped to advance their cause in December by revealing that Fowler, who  oversees the district's finances, had filed for personal bankruptcy earlier in  the year to relieve $126,000 in debts. They said it showed that he was  financially irresponsible.  </P> <P> The recall effort got a big boost two weeks ago when Fowler supported an  unpopular plan to dismantle court-ordered busing in the district and gradually  return its students to neighborhood schools. The board voted 3 to 2 to end the  busing. The recall campaign grew quickly thereafter, with 4,000 signatures  gathered last weekend alone.  </P> <P> Fowler complained Wednesday that organizers capitalized unfairly on the vote.  </P> <P> "Rather than debate the integration issue on its merits, they made an emotional  issue of it and whipped it into a hysterical thing," he said.  </P> <P> County election officials were working Wednesday to confirm that the petitions  contained at least 7,322 signatures, the minimum required to force a recall  election, said Ruth Schelper, assistant registrar of voters.  </P> <P> If that minimum is reached, election officials will begin the laborious task of  checking to determine whether each signature belongs to a registered voter  living within the Oxnard School District, a 15-school elementary-level district  that includes most of Oxnard and some parts of Port Hueneme.  </P></p>

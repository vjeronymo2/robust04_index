			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ravil Mustafin report: "Meeting in the Ministry of </F> Defense"]    [Text] On 30 May Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian  Federation minister of defense, held a meeting with Michaela  Geiger, parliamentary state secretary of the FRG Ministry of  Defense in the Bundestag. Pavel Grachev noted that Russia's  proposals on the NATO "Partnership for Peace" program were  greeted with understanding among practically all the  participants in the talks during the recent visit by the head of  the Russian military department to the NATO headquarters in  Brussels. Only certain details remain to be elaborated. Russia  will be able to join the "Partnership for Peace" program within  two or three weeks, P. Grachev noted. But for this to happen,  Western countries should study these proposals and draw up a  document through diplomatic channels which would express  agreement with Russia's proposals.    The Russian defense minister's optimism is also connected  with the fact that when he was in Brussels, Pavel Grachev "saw  support for the Russian proposals on the part of FRG Defense  Minister Volker Ruehe." "The greater the country the more they  understand us," the head of the Russian military department  noted. Unfortunately, unlike the ministers of defense of NATO  countries, from whom Pavel Grachev perceived support and "a good  attitude toward me and toward Russia," to use his own words, the  CIS countries do not always display understanding toward the  problems facing Moscow.</p>

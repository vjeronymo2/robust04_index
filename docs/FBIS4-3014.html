			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] Premier Lien Chan has blamed Washington for making  what he billed as selective, unfair, and unjust decision by  singling out Taiwan as its first target of trade sanction under  the Pelly amendment for inadequate wildlife protection.    It is the first time that Taiwan has been hit with trade  sanctions of any kind from any nation. Lien told lawmakers that  this is a selective action running counter to fair and just  principle as well as ignoring the concerted effort the ROC  [Republic of China] Government and people have made in  ecological and wildlife protection. Lien's reaction came a  couple of hours after U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the  measure to subject Taiwan to sanctions on the grounds that the  island failed to satisfactorily end illegal commerce in rhino  horns and tiger parts.    The ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed its deep  regret  and dissatisfaction with the U.S. Government's obviously unfair  and unjust sanction of the ROC, it said.</p>

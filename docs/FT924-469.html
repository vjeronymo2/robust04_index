			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: US economy Yesterday's 0.2 per cent rise in US personal incomes may have disappointed the equity market slightly, but special factors were at work. Most recent economic data confirm that a modest but well-founded recovery is under way, and the US economy is likely to grow by around 2.5 per cent in 1993. That may well be enough to prevent President-elect Clinton from launching a large fiscal recovery package. US Treasury bond yields, which have declined since the election, may fall further as the prospect of increased supply fades. However, economic growth may not be enough to cut unemployment much. With wage pressures low and commodity prices weak, inflation is likely to remain subdued. A background of growth, low inflation and falling bond yields is tailor made for a bull market in equities. And while the narrowly-based Dow Jones Industrials index has been held back by laggards like IBM, the broader Standard &amp; Poors Composite index has made new highs in the past week. The good run appears to have momentum, and there is evidence of small investors moving money from bond to equity funds. Overseas fund managers may also increase their low weightings in US stocks. But such flow-of-funds arguments are slippery, and the market may be approaching a peak. Many high-quality stocks are now on high ratings, and there is increasing turnover in new issues. The S&amp;P now sells at 16 times the most optimistic estimates of 1993 corporate earnings. In the absence of a boom, it is unlikely to push much higher.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The German foreign minister went into the  negotiations on Norway's membership of the European Union  optimistically. Shortly before midnight, however, an annoyed  Klaus Kinkel had to announce the breakdown of the unsuccessful  talks. His colleagues had worked on a compromise proposal on  the fish issue in long, tough negotiations with the Norwegians.  The Spaniards were to be given higher catch quotas in the  future. But Madrid was unyielding.    [Begin recording] [Kinkel] The failure to resolve the fish  issue is Spain's responsibility, and to a lesser extent  Portugal's, but basically Spain's. We had put together a  package -- the presidency, the Commission, and the Europeans, we  Germans in particular -- we negotiated the issue bilaterally  with Norway. The package didn't go far enough for the  Spaniards. Great Britain was mainly responsible for the failure  to reach agreement on majorities as it saw no possibility for  agreement.    [Unidentified correspondent] Over the last few weeks the  impression has arisen that the Spaniards are resisting Norway's  membership in principle. Do you think this impression is  justified?    [Kinkel] No, I don't think this impression is justified. The  Spaniards want Norway to join. They have their internal  problems with the fish issue -- we have to understand that. On  the other hand, I didn't really understand today why they had to  exhaust this issue in such detail. In my opinion a solution  should have been possible. No, Spain wants them to join but it  will get a bit more difficult now. And Spain has to move now.  [end recording]</p>

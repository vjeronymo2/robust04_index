			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TRIAL OF NAVY PETTY OFFICER ACCUSED OF MURDER BEGINS  </P> <P> Jurors heard opening arguments Tuesday in the murder trial of Robert William  Nydegger, a Navy petty officer charged with killing his roommate and stuffing  the body into a refrigerator in the back yard of their Imperial Beach house.  </P> <P> Nydegger, 43, is charged with murdering 39-year-old Timothy Cudd with a lethal  dose of the antihistamine known in its over-the-counter form as Benadryl.  </P> <P> Nydegger is also charged with four counts of forgery stemming from the alleged  use of four of Cudd's checks. He is accused of passing or attempting to pass  checks worth $3,431.  </P> <P> In his opening statement to the jury, Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Amador outlined  the circumstantial evidence -- including Nydegger's apparent attempted suicide  with Benadryl and the discovery of Cudd's checkbook in Nydegger's desk -- which  he said point to Nydegger's guilt.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Charles Bumer insisted during his opening statement that  Cudd's death was a suicide.  </P> <P> Cudd was afflicted with Huntington's chorea, a debilitating nerve disorder that  had begun to affect his movement. Bumer also said that Cudd was suffering from  the same psychiatric disorder affecting Nydegger -- post-trauma stress  syndrome, a condition Bumer said resulted from their service in Vietnam.  </P> <P> Bumer admitted that Nydegger "may have behaved strangely" or in an "irrational"  manner by attempting to hide the body, but contended that was because of his  own mental illness.  </P> <P> The trial is expected to last about four weeks.  </P></p>

At least in the way  it is transmitted (through the air). This important detail had  created widespread panic among the people. Among the medical  community, though, there is calm although the basic tools for  responding do not exist. Thus far quickly eradicating the  epidemic remains uncertain.    Ever since this epidemic spread in the wilaya of Tizi-Ouzou,  there has been a combat-like commotion among local public-health  authorities. Six people have died, a total of 140 people have  been hospitalized, and there were as many cases of healthy  carriers, it was reported at the University Hospital Center.  Besides, the state of alert is always maintained.    However at the "Antidiphtheria Combat Committee," which had  been set up as soon as the epidemic appeared, they are clear  about it. For them, the situation has just about been brought  under control. It should be mentioned that this  multidisciplinary group made of up experts continues to meet  each Sunday to get updated on the situation.    It has been pointed out that the first case of diphtheria  was  reported in Ath Zmenzer, a rural community of 11,000 located  about 10 km from the town of Tizi-Ouzou. A young ninth grade  student died and several people were infected. Not only had the  news shaken village residents it had also produced major panic.  The rush to get vaccinated was indescribable. The small  treatment room could clearly not satisfy everyone. The doctor at  the health center, who only works mornings (?), and was  overwhelmed, had to push the panic-stricken crowd back.    Because of the confusion between antidiphtheria vaccines and  DWTP (diphtheria, whopping cough, tetanus, and poliomyelitis),  several people ran to private pharmacies (because public-sector  pharmacies did not sell them) to buy some.  <H5>  Limited Vaccination </H5>   After the death of this teenager, only some members of his  family were vaccinated, it was said. As to the grade school he  attended, it would appear matters were not taken seriously. One  teacher recalled: "The day the vaccination team arrived at our  school, only the dead boy's class was vaccinated and the teacher  who was in class at the exact time they arrived."    Several months later, the wait was still on. Among all of  the  staff and all the students, the panic was continuous.    Dr. Bourbia, the main leader in the antidiphtheria fight,  stated that: "a real panic arose around the vaccination in  Tizi-Ouzou. Of course, even if the vaccines are available, you  cannot vaccinate an entire population. People need to understand  that you can only vaccinate [text illegible], such as the family  or classmates where school children are involved."    In fact, these vaccination "criteria" are not followed, as  we  have just seen. Is this an isolated case? Don't be too sure of  it! The people's vaccination coverage is far from satisfying the  required standards. This epidemic revealed all.    At Draa Ben Khedda, a medium-sized city, the situation is  more dramatic. It is Sunday, 30 January, and the time is 1000.  At the city's polyclinic, many people are waiting. Parents are  anxious. A middle-aged woman carrying a baby in her arms  exclaims: "I have come for my baby's second vaccination and they  have just told me there isn't any."    A nurse would add that: "We are out of our supply of DWTP  and  we have been for 10 days. We are expecting a delivery of vaccine  any day now." Given this situation, parents had to buy it for  106 Algerian dinars. For their part, pharmacists pointed out  that all the vaccines were gone and that their orders would not  be filled until the end of February. In every corner of the  wilaya of Tizi-Ouzou, the diphtheria epidemic is still a primary  discussion topic.    For their part, public-health officials are reassuring. They  say that of the 140 cases of diphtheria, there were few typical  cases, and that the number of new cases is clearly declining.  According to these same officials, the patients are responding  well, "despite the lack of serum and the insufficiency of  vaccines." In addition, we would point out that the Nedir  Mohamed Hospital made available 30 beds from their infectious  diseases unit and 40 beds from their psychiatric unit. So every  possible agency was requisitioned and nine patients were  transferred to the El-Kettar Hospital in Algiers. Furthermore,  it was revealed that the individuals affected are, generally  speaking, between the ages of 10 and 15 who were poorly  vaccinated or not at all. As to the origin of this epidemic, a  source in the medical community stated that the population of  the wilaya of Tizi-Ouzou was infected by a citizen of the wilaya  of Bouira who was reported to have stayed in the south of  Algeria (a region supposedly infected by peoples of the Sahara).    It should be noted that the affected areas are the most  remote (Azzefoun, Ain El-Hammam, Draa El-Mizan). In these very  remote areas, the people are very far away from health services.  One country doctor said that he had not been aware of the  existence of diphtheria in his area until after the burial of  one patient.    Well, now! Even the medical community is caught unawares.  For  some, [diphtheria] is basically a childhood disease.  Furthermore, it is said that there exists another viral illness  (infectious mononucleosis) that has the same symptoms as  diphtheria.    Upper respiratory ailments (influenza, colds, angina) make  it  difficult to diagnose positive diphtheria cases, they go on to  say. In the case of Dr. Bourbia, he has to wait until the end of  the winter, which would bring its share of upper respiratory  illnesses, to isolate the diphtheria cases and hope to eradicate  it once and for all. But, when you are dealing with an epidemic,  no one can predict how it will develop. Several questions remain.    How did we get to this point? Was vaccination coverage  correct? At school, is the vaccination certificate  systematically required? Have the public-health officials  assumed their responsibilities to force parents to vaccinate  their children who were born at home?    Diphtheria is a contagious, deadly illness. You can be a  healthy carrier and transmit the disease to anybody who is  unvaccinated. In other words, the lives of many of us are in  danger.</p>

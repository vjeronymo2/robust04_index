			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jelena Radovanov on a news conference by </F> Vladislav Jovanovic after talks with Douglas Hogg, minister of  state at the British Foreign Office, in Belgrade on 4 May --  recorded]    [Text] [Radovanov] Assessing today's talks with President  Milosevic, Douglas Hogg said that they spoke about very  important aspects of the crisis in Bosnia and proposals to halt  the armed clashes, as well as proposals for a peaceful solution  to the crisis in Bosnia. We also discussed the UNPA [UN  Protected Areas] in Croatia, Mr. Hogg said. We did not discuss  Brcko, since our talks did not go into details. I agree with  increasing the number of military observers in the northern part  of Bosnia, Hogg said. I did not arrive with a concrete plan, he  said, but I did come with two important messages. The first one  is the vital importance of an unconditional cease-fire, and the  other one is the recognition of the importance of an overall  peace solution for Bosnia, to be based on the partition of the  territory on the basis of 49 percent to 51 percent. As you  know, this has been under discussion, Hogg said. Hogg also said  that there would be no alleviation of the sanctions until the  war was over and until the peace plan was implemented.    This is how FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic  assessed  the talks between Douglas Hogg and President Milosevic:    [Jovanovic] You see, these talks referred to the topics that  Mr. Hogg mentioned, that is, the situation in Bosnia and the  negotiations with Krajina, and the situation in Kosovo was also  mentioned. We focused on the most current issues. The minister  has already mentioned that it was the work of the contact group  that was the most important, then the need to conclude an  agreement on the cease-fire. We also discussed the great need  and the common interest in negotiations for a political  solution. We agreed that the work of the contact group was very  important and that there was a need for an immediate cessation  of hostilities. The political negotiations have to follow  immediately afterwards. There was not much talk about details.  Mr. Hogg mentioned that there was a need for a 51 percent to 49  percent division. That is not a problem that should halt  negotiations and the cease-fire at the moment.    On the other hand, we pointed to the problem of the  sanctions  that are an absolute problem, which are not only the generator  of the crisis and other problems but also a main obstacle to the  implementation of any political solution, be it for Bosnia or  Krajina, or the Yugoslav space in general. We found the common  ground there that it was vital to remove obstacles on one party  to the implementation of the future political solution.  However, we could not discuss when and how, because as the  minister pointed out, the common stand of the Western countries  is that for the time being -- until the peace agreement is  reached on Bosnia-Herzegovina -- there can be no talk about the  lifting of the sanctions.    However, we pointed out that the sanctions were a form of  hostilities that relate to the entire Serbian nations, not just  to us in Yugoslavia, and that parallel to the cessation of  hostilities in Bosnia-Herzegovina it was necessary to refer to  the need to end other forms of hostilities. The sanctions are  one of these. The media war and the one-sided approach by the  international community to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and  the Yugoslav crisis in general is another form of hostility. It  is impossible to stop military hostilities and maintain the  economic and propaganda pressure, as well as psychological and  other forms of hostilities.    We believe that after these talks that all those who are  interested in peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the crisis in  Yugoslavia will better understand the need for one revised  approach to the Bosnian and the Yugoslav crisis -- which is to  remove the unequal treatment of the participants in the Yugoslav  crisis, and particularly the biased approach -- that this would  provide a quick movement forward toward peace and the  stabilization of the entire situation in the Balkans.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Record paid for royal porcelain: Saleroom A pair of Louis XVI ormolu-mounted Chinese porcelain ewers supplied to Marie-Antoinette at Versailles and hidden during the revolution, fetched Pounds 1,046,500 at Christie's yesterday, a record for any French decorative art. The violet Kangxi porcelain vessels, 48cm high and bearing exceptional quality gilt-bronze goat's-head and Bacchic masks, swan-tipped spouts and scrolling handles, were attributed to the bronzier Pierre Gouthiere, and were sold by the Trustees of the Luton Hoo Foundation. Celadon porcelains with flamboyant Louis XV mounts, also from Luton Hoo, also exceeded expectations, as did a sumptuous red and turquoise flambe-glazed vase and cover which realised Pounds 298,500. An auction record for a carpet - Pounds 1,321,500 - was set for a Louis XV Savonnerie carpet emblazoned with the royal arms of France. La Fondation Napoleon paid Pounds 62,000 for Bonaparte's necessaire dentaire, an amboyna box with a chilling array of gold and steel tools, reputedly acquired by Baron Nathaniel de Rothschild's grandfather from a soldier who took it from Napoleon's baggage at the battle of Waterloo. The sale totalled Pounds 6,143,420 with 96 per cent sold.</p>

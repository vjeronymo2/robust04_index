			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: John Lewis interim profit falls to Pounds 16.4m INTERIM profits at John Lewis Partnership, the employee-owned department store and supermarket group, fell for the fifth successive year, in spite of a better than expected performance from the Waitrose chain. Pre-tax profits for the six months to July 31 were Pounds 16.4m, down from Pounds 18.2m. Last year's figure was restated downwards from Pounds 20.2m, after John Lewis was advised by its actuaries in the second half that it should increase its pension contributions. That increased first-half pension costs from Pounds 5.7m for the first half of 1992 to Pounds 7.7m this time. A further increase in pension costs this year to Pounds 8.7m accounted for much of the fall in trading profit, after pension costs, to Pounds 28.5m from Pounds 30.3m. First-half taxable profits at the group have collapsed from more than Pounds 50.8m in 1988, although the rate of decline slowed this year. The group, which has 22 department stores and 105 Waitrose supermarkets, has been hit hard by recession, and by increasing competition, especially in the grocery market. Waitrose has been hampered by its refusal to trade on Sundays and its slowness in introducing new technology, and has expanded less rapidly than its competitors because of its inability to raise capital on the stock market. Mr Stuart Hampson, chairman, said that any fall in the bottom line was unwelcome. However, the decline of only Pounds 0.8m in trading profits before pension costs showed how successful the group had been in containing costs and boosting sales. Group turnover increased from Pounds 1.09bn to Pounds 1.13bn. Sales increased 6 per cent to Pounds 532.5m in the department stores. Sales at Waitrose increased 1 per cent to Pounds 577.3m, in contrast to the fall that had been forecast, but profits were hit by one-off costs associated with improving the distribution network and introducing scanning in the stores. Sales in the wholesaling and manufacturing division fell 11 per cent to Pounds 17.6m. Mr Hampson warned that the second half would be 'challenging', but trading in the last six weeks had exceeded estimates.</p>

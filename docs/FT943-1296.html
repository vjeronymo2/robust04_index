			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / As They Say In Europe: Does British philosophy exist? - Why the death of intellectual Sir Karl Popper made news abroad Taking up from where we left off last week - the inadequate intellectual agility of the English - we see the same phenomenon highlighted in an important story this week. Sir Karl Popper died a week ago: he was, according to the Nobel prizewinner, Sir Peter Medawar, the greatest philosopher of science 'who has ever lived'. His work extended beyond that area, but for the British his death was a matter largely for the obituary pages. On the continent Popper's death was news. Like most British intellectuals of his generation, Sir Karl was born in Vienna in the first decade of the century. He left for New Zealand initially, to avoid the Nazis. He was a member of the famous Vienna Circle which gave logical positivism and the verification principle to an unsuspecting world. To British journalists, the verification principle is a tool employed by a ruthless management in any crackdown on expense claims. To continentals the mere mention of such matters provides the occasion for a flashy display of intellectual skills. Few there would admit any deficiency in their acquaintance with the course of 20th century philosophy. This was nowhere better illustrated than in Vienna itself. Among the massive tributes paid to Popper, the article by Pia Maria Plechl, a leading local columnist and luminary, in Die Presse, stood out. She opened with an alleged quotation from the philosopher, which, in one formulation, concerned a black man searching for a black hat in a black cellar. A fruitless search might have led him to conclude, 'It's really not there.' Popper had shown the world that the correct response was, 'Maybe it's really not there.' Maybe the commuter on the rush-hour tram from Grinzing understands this sort of thing but it left me puzzled. Why does the man have to be black, for example? In Vienna, Popper mixed with the logical positivists. Another noted philosopher, A J Ayer, when asked on television why he had ceased to be a logical positivist, replied: 'Because it was all rubbish.' This statement caused a sensation in the British philosophical community which speculated for some years on its exact meaning. In southern Europe television dominated many of the Popper-inspired stories. The reporters there wisely kept to philosophies they could understand. Sunday's La Stampa pretended it was really interested in Popper's seminal work of 1945, The Open Society and its Enemies, but did not take long to get round to his view that television was the real enemy of democracy and that it encouraged violence among the young. El Pais on Monday was so entranced with this topic that it left Popper to its television critic, who, under the headline, 'Popper No' said he did not like the man. 'I do not want the dogmatism of the anti-dogmatists, and I do not like those who not only believe the US model is the least worst of all possible models but usually believe it's the best.' The writer went on to argue: 'The attribution of crime to television is a matter for minor popular psychologists.' But the adjacent listings showed Popper was right: la Ley de Los Angeles (LA Law) jostled with bull-fighting and westerns for the attention of the Spanish public that evening. An editorial, entitled 'Popper's Hour', appeared on the front of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. In Paris, Liberation devoted a page and a half to the great man - 'We lose Popper'. They both grandly noted how he had been able to translate the principle of fallibilism from science to philosophy. This roughly states that nothing can prove a theory to be absolutely true, because something might come along that falsifies it, but only one thing needs to go wrong for it to be proved false. This is the philosophical version of Murphy's law and has certain compelling qualities. But the fallibility principle must presumably apply to the theory that watching television makes you violent. And equally to the theory that watching television does not make you violent? (As you will gather, I did not emerge from my philosophy finals covered with glory.) It was probably the Frankfurter Allgemeine that produced the most impressive testimony as to Popper's influence: 'He played a significant role in the westernisation of the Federal Republic.' This had happened because the former chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, had discovered him early on and then helped push his Social Democratic Party away from dogmatic Marxism. I cannot believe that it is usual for the death of a philosopher to make such an impact on European commentators. Nor that there has in recent years been a such a man who has spoken from beyond the grave in so many voices. And in so many languages, apart from English that is.

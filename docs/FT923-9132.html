			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / TV gains access to Scots courts SCOTTISH courts are to become the first in the UK to admit television cameras, it was announced yesterday. Lord Hope, the Lord President, who is head of the Scottish judiciary, yesterday said he was in favour of TV cameras covering criminal and civil appeal hearings. The historic decision was welcomed by advocates and solicitors in Scotland, and by broadcasting organisations. In London, the Bar Council  - the barristers' ruling body - said the decision should be emulated in England and Wales. Lord Hope said the introduction of television cameras would require 'detailed investigation and experiment', and no date could be given for when it would begin. Scotland has a separate legal system from that of England and Wales, where a law of 1925 bans photography in court. Lord Hope said it was likely that court proceedings could be televised 'without undue interference'. Parliament was televised and there was 'sufficient support within the judiciary and the legal profession in Scotland' for the introduction of TV cameras. Under Lord Hope's decision, neither criminal nor civil trials may be televised while they are in progress because of 'risks to the administration of justice'. But they may be filmed for later broadcast for documentary and educational purposes, provided all parties agreed and the presiding judge approved the final product before it was broadcast. The televising of appeal hearings would be subject to the approval of the presiding judge. Ceremonies in courtrooms could be televised and pictures of judges would be allowed for archive purposes, but without sound. Lord Hope said it was in the public interest that people should know how justice was administered. TV cameras are allowed in criminal trials in the US. In 1989, the English Bar Council recommended that pilot projects of televising courts be introduced and sponsored a private member's bill that would have amended the law accordingly.</p>

Nadezhdin: ``Criminal Business''] </F>   [Text] It is a well-known fact that the road to Hell is  paved with good intentions. Alas, this simple truth is often  forgotten -- especially when misfortune enters our life and we  are sparing no resources trying to help ourselves or our loved  ones. And hospital physicians are often forced to ask a  patient's relatives to give blood. The shortage of blood and  blood substitutes has immediately spawned a criminal business.  Street dealers very boldly selling both albumin and plasma have  appeared in Moscow in great numbers. Beware of buying similar  preparations from so-called ``unestablished individuals.''  Laboratory studies of the blood substitutes demonstrate that  they have been isolated from the blood of animals, and  transfusion of these substitutes into a human may cause death.    If necessary, use the following opportunity. Come to the  Blood Transfusion Center and donate your own blood. In exchange,  you will receive the very same quantity of the necessary blood  group.</p>

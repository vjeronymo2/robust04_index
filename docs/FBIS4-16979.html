			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- Having on the whole  supported the draft civic concord agreement, the Democratic  Russia Movement and the Socialist Workers Party have at the same  time addressed to the presidential administration several  complaints against this document, expected to be signed on April  28.    In its statement, the Democratic Russia Movement calls for  the deletion from the draft agreement of the thesis banning the  use of assessments of the events of August 1991 and of  September-October 1993 "as a pretext for deepening the  confrontation". The movement's coordination council regards  this thesis as "unacceptable". This view is shared by Valeriya  Novodvorskaya, leader of the Russian Democratic Union.  Interviewed by ITAR-TASS, the eminent human rights defender  said: "How will the democrats be able to look into the eyes of  the people, whom they had urged to man the barricades, if such a  dubious ban is adopted?".    The supporters of Democratic Russia want some declarative  commitments to be deleted from the text of the agreement and a  clearer delimitation of responsibilities for the fulfilment of  the memorandum terms.    Chairman of the Socialist Workers Party Lyudmila Vartazarova  moves to delete from the draft agreement paragraphs duplicating  the Russian Constitution or contradicting it in the part  relating to the observance of human rights. Moreover,  Vartazarova warns against "the discreditation of the very idea  of national concord by rash and unconsidered actions". She  suggests a procedure for the document's broad public discussion.</p>

			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A SIEGE OF FIRE;  </P> <P> EMERGENCY DECLARATIONS MAY TRIGGER FEDERAL HELP  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian declared a state of emergency Friday in San Bernardino  and Riverside counties, triggering a variety of state assistance ranging from  tax relief to low-interest loans for those who suffered damage and loss in  fires that have ravaged Southern California this week.  </P> <P> Beyond what the state can offer, the declarations pave the way for President  Bush to declare stricken regions as national disaster areas and pour in federal  resources to help affected residents, officials said.  </P> <P> The governor on Thursday had issued emergency proclamations for Santa Barbara  and Glendale disaster areas.  </P> <P> "The main reason we wanted the declaration is so that the president can declare  a federal disaster area as soon as possible," said John Passerello, assistant  director of the state Office of Emergency Services. "We can't get federal funds  for rebuilding and temporary housing until the President does that."  </P> <P> Deukmejian has written to the President requesting the federal declaration and  the White House is expected to reach a decision today or Sunday, Passerello  said. An emergency aid center staffed by the Federal Emergency Management  Agency, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies is set to begin  operating at 8 a.m. today in Goleta.  </P> <P> The governor's declaration also allows him to tap the state's reserve set up  for economic uncertainties to help the areas hardest hit by the fires.  Deukmejian has insisted on maintaining a billion-dollar reserve in the state  budget, of which up to $40 million can be used for disasters.  </P> <P> However, only $19 million remains in the disaster fund and it is unclear  whether it will be replenished, according to the Department of Finance. The  state fiscal year ends Saturday, and lawmakers have not yet passed a new budget  for the 1990-91 fiscal year. Some legislators oppose Deukmejian's request that  they approve another billion-dollar reserve for next year.  </P> <P> State officials say no state emergency money has been required yet in Santa  Barbara or Glendale. But they added that the funds may soon be needed, because  the local governments fighting the blaze may soon turn to the state for help.  </P> <P> Among the other impacts of Deukmejian's emergency declaration:  </P> <P> The state's mutual aid system, which requires local firefighters from other  parts of the state to help combat the blaze, has been activated. This was  already starting to happen before the governor's declaration, but his move  ensures that the state's full firefighting resources can be deployed.  </P> <P> The state will provide property tax relief for damaged or destroyed private  property. Homeowners will be able to rebuild their residences and still be  taxed at the old property tax rate.  </P> <P> In the absence of other assistance such as insurance, the state will provide  low-interest loans to help rebuild homes damaged or destroyed in the blaze.  </P></p>

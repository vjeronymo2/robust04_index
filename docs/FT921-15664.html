			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Bush in Japan: Quayle still faces tough fight for credibility - The past continues to dog Bush's deputy DAN QUAYLE, US vice-president, carefully set about business as usual yesterday in the wake of President George Bush's collapse in Tokyo. He spent a few hours in his White House office before leaving for a campaign trip to New Hampshire, which will hold the first primary election of the year next month. Mr Quayle defines his role in Mr Bush's re-election team as the campaign's pit bull terrier, assigned to confront head-on the conservative challengers for the Republican party's nomination. That he is allowed to campaign at all is a measure of the ground he has regained since his disastrous showing in the days after Mr Bush picked him to be his running mate in the 1988 election. Successful campaigns in Indiana for election to the House of Representatives and then the Senate had not accustomed him to hostile press questioning, and Mr Quayle himself concedes that he lost control. Mr Quayle thought the onslaught would die away after the election. It did not. The vice-president remained the butt of every satirist, building his own legend with a new string of blunders and spawning a vast Quayle joke industry. Over the last year, however, the image of the vice-president as a pampered featherbrain has undergone considerable revision. In what is widely acknowledged as a difficult role with few defined functions, Mr Quayle has managed to make a number of initiatives. His special field has been deregulation, as chairman of the president's council on competitiveness. Assessments of his success as a deregulator are mixed. Some right-wing groups complain that the Bush administration has added new layers of red tape. Other critics contend that his well-publicised initiatives to curb America's litigation addiction by reforming the civil justice system or to speed up the Food and Drug Administration's procedures for approving new medicines have, for the most part, simply repackaged measures that were already being implemented. Perhaps the best testimony to his effectiveness, however, is the fierce hostility that several congressional committees are now showing to his competitiveness council. At the same time, Mr Quayle is increasingly considered as a bona fide spokesman for the right-wing of the Republican party within the predominantly pragmatic Bush administration. Mr Quayle's press clippings, too, have changed markedly for the better. Mr David Broder, the Washington Post's senior political writer, and Mr Robert Woodward, its well-known investigative reporter, are publishing this week a seven-part reassessment of his career. They depict an ambitious politician who, far from being plucked from obscurity, in fact conducted a skilful, low-key campaign for the vice-presidency; and their judgments appear for the most part to reflect favourably on Mr Quayle. But the vice-president's problems lie less with Mr Broder and his ilk than with Mr Jay Leno or Mr David Letterman, the late-night television comedians whose jokes have done much to create the Quayle legend. While Mr Quayle's stock has undoubtedly risen in Washington, it is less clear that the rest of the country has forgotten the disastrous, if arguably unfair, first impression he made in 1988. A Gallup poll in November showed that three quarters of those questioned had no greater confidence in Mr Quayle as a leader after seeing him in office for three years. Only 37 per cent thought him qualified to be president, against 53 per cent who found him unqualified. Even among Republican voters, 32 per cent believed Mr Bush should choose another running mate for the 1992 election. Few votes are decided on the basis of the vice-presidential nominee, and a few months ago, with President Bush coasting in the polls, the unfavourable perception of Mr Quayle might not have mattered. But with the president's collapse in Tokyo reawakening concerns about Mr Bush's health, Mr Quayle has much to do to turn himself into an electoral asset.</p>

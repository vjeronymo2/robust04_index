			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Yachtsmen to help fight drug trafficking Members of the Royal Yachting Association are to be recruited to help Customs and Excise in anti-drugs operations by reporting suspicious vessels at sea. Other sailors, ferry companies and airlines have already agreed to take part in monitoring isolated stretches of coast as part of the Anti-Drugs Alliance. Yachtsmen are being asked to report vessels outside shipping lanes, high-speed powerboats far from shore or cargo transfers at sea. Reports from one ferry company last year led to seven drugs seizures. The association is to sign a memorandum of understanding with Customs and Excise at the London Boat Show at Earls Court today.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Lowndes Lambert pays up to Pounds 1.9m for specialist broker LOWNDES LAMBERT, the insurance broker which was floated last year, has acquired Crowley Colosso Holdings, which owns a fine arts and jewellery specialist broker. The initial consideration is Pounds 1.4m, comprising Pounds 697,000 in cash and the issue to the vendors of 253,455 new Lowndes shares. Further consideration in shares or cash to a cap of Pounds 1.9m will be paid in proportion to any brokerage income during the next two financial years to October in excess of the most recent year's earned brokerage fees till last June. Mr Richard Shaw, Lowndes' chairman, said he would be surprised if the additional payments exceeded half of the capped limit. The accounts for Colosso for the year to June 30 1991 showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 53,000 on turnover of Pounds 1.37m. The new shares will rank equally with existing shares, and the vendors have pledged not to dispose of them for 12 months after completion.</p>

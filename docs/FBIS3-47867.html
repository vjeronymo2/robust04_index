			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 19 January Morning </F> Edition]    [Text] The Japanese Government will present the U.S.  Government this week with new concessionary proposals, including  a revamp of the current tender system, for the government  procurement sector which is the subject of discussion at  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks.    The government, which had insisted that more than 130,000  SDR  (special drawing rights; approximately 20.15 million yen) worth  of government procurement be subject to bids, has decided to  lower that figure to 100,000 SDR (approximately 15.5 million  yen). The government also has decided to extend the  announcement period of bids on the OFFICIAL GAZETTE by 10-20  days.    Another decision is the adoption of a new system under which  the government briefs foreign and domestic firms on its outline  procurement plans prior to publishing them in the OFFICIAL  GAZETTE. In this way, the government has decided to accept most  U.S. demands in a bid to break the stalemate in the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks.    One of the priority sectors at the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks is procurement of medical instruments and  telecommunications equipment. The government intends to ask for  U.S. concessions by presenting its own concessionary proposals  at a working-level meeting on medical instruments scheduled in  Tokyo on 18 and 19 January, and at a working-level meeting on  telecommunications equipment due to be held in Washington on 22  January.    According to the concessionary proposals, more than 100,000  SDR worth of medical instruments and telecommunications  equipment would be subject to bid. The Japanese Government has  so far insisted on running announcements for medical instruments  and telecommunications equipment for 40 days in the OFFICIAL  GAZETTE, but has decided to extend this to 50 days.    However, it has decided to keep the current 40-day period  unchanged for such widely used medical items as X-ray machines,  though extend the period to 60 days for specialist medical  instruments which require longer to develop.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Court move on Nigerian bank's debt THE High Court has appointed a receiver to recover the Dollars 250,000 (Pounds 145,000) balance of a Dollars 2.7m debt owed by Mercantile Bank of Nigeria, a leading Nigerian bank. Last December the court made a sequestration order against the bank for its contempt of court in failing to disclose its assets. The disclosure order was made when Minerva Securities (CI), a Channel Islands commodity trader, sought to enforce a Dollars 1,254,977 judgment against Mercantile in 1982. The writ of sequestration was discharged in January when Mercantile Bank made disclosure. Minerva has since recovered the bulk of the Dollars 2.7m it is owed. The judgment was based on a 1978 letter of undertaking by Mercantile Bank to pay Dollars 1,254,977 in exchange for the release of shipping documents. Lengthy litigation followed in Nigeria when Mercantile challenged the judgment, ending in February last year when the Nigerian Supreme Court set aside an Appeal Court ruling nullifying the judgment. The receiver is Mr Geoffrey Holroyd, of Wheawill and Sudworth, the accountancy firm.</p>

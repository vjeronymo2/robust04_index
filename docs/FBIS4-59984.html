			<p>BFN     [Text] A number of foreign correspondents yesterday  visited al-'Anad Base and viewed the fortifications and military  equipment and vehicles captured by the forces of Constitutional  legitimacy when they took control of the base the day before  yesterday.    BBC radio correspondent (Simon Angerma), who visited the  base, said in a report aired by the radio today that he saw some  tanks of the forces of legitimacy deployed within the perimeter  of the base. He also noted that the antiaircraft guns repulsed  several air raids launched by aircraft of the forces of apostasy  and secession over the area and forced them to flee.    The BBC correspondent added that a large number of the rebel  troops withdrew from the base. He also said he saw the wreckage  of a helicopter downed near the base entrance and the charred  corpses of the two pilots.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO - Social Democratic Party (SDP)  [SDPJ] Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said Thursday his party may  withdraw its ministers from the coalition cabinet of Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa unless he drops a plan to introduce a  new 7 percent indirect tax, tentatively named a national welfare  tax.    "We may withdraw" the six ministers from Hosokawa's  21-member  cabinet, Murayama told a hurriedly arranged news conference in  the early hours of Thursday morning in response to a reporter's  question on how the SDP would respond if Hosokawa did not change  his mind.    If the SDP quits the coalition, the Hosokawa cabinet may  have  to resign en bloc, political sources said.    Murayama blasted Hosokawa for waging a disinformation  campaign in order to implement what he said would amount to a  virtual raise in the rate of the current 3 percent consumption  tax.    "Even if the prime minister says Japan needs the new tax to  cope with an increased welfare outlay for our rapidly aging  society, the proposed new tax is tantamount to a consumption tax  hike in essence," he said.    He made the statements over an hour after Hosokawa announced  that his coalition government has decided to introduce the  "national welfare tax" to offset revenue shortfalls stemming  from a 6 trillion yen tax cut.    Hosokawa told a news conference the government wants to  introduce the new tax from April 1, 1997.    "The new tax will be introduced to finance the large cost of  building up the social infrastructure, improving the people's  living environment and financing growing welfare expenditures,"  Hosokawa said.    Murayama said the new indirect tax on sales of most goods  and  services might dampen consumer spending, saying, "judging from  the current recession, it is not wise to introduce such a new  tax."    "I told the prime minister that his administration should  include wording in the new tax legislation that would obligate  the government to use all the revenue from the new tax for  expenditures related to welfare," he said.    "However, the premier turned a deaf ear to our party's  request," he said.    "With the introduction of the new tax, the administration  would only have changed the name of the consumption tax and the  revenue, in actuality, will end up being spent for the general  account of the state budget," he said.    The Japanese public will never accept the government's  argument that the new tax is necessary unless it explains why it  needs to introduce such a tax by stating concrete figures and  the items of outlays related to welfare which the tax will  finance, he said.</p>

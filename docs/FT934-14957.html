			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / BR clears way for leasing market THE government yesterday moved to allay fears over the future of British Rail's West Coast main line services after Network SouthEast won a year-long battle for new trains which are to be financed under an innovative Pounds 150m leasing deal. The deal ends speculation over how BR would use a special leasing concession announced in last year's Autumn Statement, and will benefit up to 125,000 London commuters. It opens the way for the creation of a leasing market for rolling stock and also safeguards for a year the jobs of more than 1,000 workers at ABB Transportation's York works, where the new trains will be built. InterCity's West Coast main line had been vying with Network SouthEast for new trains, but BR has decided to use the concession to lease 41 new four-coach Networker Express trains for Great Northern and Kent Coast services. Existing Great Northern trains will be switched to the London, Tilbury &amp; Southend line. The announcement was criticised by opposition parties. Mr Nick Harvey, Liberal Democrat transport spokesman, welcomed the investment in Network SouthEast but said the future of the West Coast main line was now in question. Mr Roger Freeman, minister for public transport, said BR's decision did not reflect any doubts over the importance of the West Coat line. He said he was prepared to consider subsidising services on the line - even after it is franchised in 1995 or 1996 - as part of rail privatisation. He also stressed that the West Coast line's rolling stock would be replaced. He said the Department of Transport and the Treasury wanted to discuss with GEC Alsthom, the engineering group, its 'interesting new ideas' on leasing. The Anglo-French group's bid to build 11 InterCity 225 trains had been judged too expensive.</p>

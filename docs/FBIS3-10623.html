Through this document, which is normally used when one is in  the middle of negotiations or to discuss political subjects,  Brazil is already consulting Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay  about their disposition to extend the trade liberation system to  other countries in the region like the Andean Pact (Venezuela,  Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia) or individual partners  like Chile. This suggestion will be discussed on 9 March during  a Mercosur meeting in Buenos Aires.    Ever since it was launched last October and presented as a  proposal during the Aladi [Latin American Integration  Association] meeting in February, the proposal has been  discussed openly (and apparently well received) by the  governments of Colombia and Venezuela. The argument for the  proposal is that Mercosur must be open and not exclude anyone  and that, if discussed within a legal framework similar to the  European Common Market, the solution of commercial issues among  South American countries will allow a rapid increase in trade.    The Brazilian Government's proposal is to create a free  trade  zone that will be ruled by the principle of promoting the  liberalization of "substantially all trade" [preceding three  words in English], an expression used by GATT: It includes all  products in general, excluding only those regarded as sensitive  by two parties. The Brazilian proposal covers an estimated 80  percent of goods and services.    According to the explanation Brazilian Foreign Minister  Celso  Amorim gave those attending the ALADI meeting, ALCSA's objective  would be to rapidly free trade between the region's countries in  a period of not more than 10 years, between 1995 and 2005.  "According to the Brazilian proposal, the ALCSA agreements  would basically consist of programs for direct, automatic, and  progressive tax reductions and cover substantive trade areas.  In our opinion, tax reductions must necessarily take place in  differentiated deadlines and paces that must be in keeping with  the degree of economic development. We also believe free trade  talks should be focused on merchandise and the tariff and  non-tariff fields," Amorim said then, adding that negotiations  would thus become more agile and the accords would be approved  in order to allow the liberalization of trade starting in  January 1995.    Brazil, for example, could negotiate specific agreements  alone where its Mercosur partners do not have direct interests.    The Brazilian Government believes its proposal will be  accepted because it simply extends to other partners a practice  used constantly during the GATT Uruguay Round negotiations,  where Brazil upheld the principle of accepting or rejecting  proposals by other countries only after consulting its Mercosur  partners.    The proposal also aims at repeating, with other countries  and  groups in the region, the Mercosur "miracle" that allowed the  country to increase by three-fold its exports to the region  between 1990 and 1993. Itamaraty believes the key to Mercosur's  success lies in the decision to give up discussing the tariff  issue product by product for a broader direct tariff reduction.  What remains to be done now is to broaden the area of action  and reap the benefits.    At dawn on 6 March, during the program "Critica &amp;  Autocritica" ["Criticism and Self-Criticism"] (produced by  GAZETA MERCANTIL and aired by Television Bandeirantes), Foreign  Minister Celso Amorim said: "South America is the priority  issue of Brazil's foreign policy." If South America had a  geopolitical importance in the past, according to the foreign  minister, it now also has an economic importance: Brazilian  trade with the region (including Mexico) already represents 25  percent of its total trade, which is equivalent to the trade  with the entire European Union and more than the 20 percent  trade with the United States and 16 percent with the Asian and  Pacific countries.    Brazil, unlike Argentina, does not intend to reveal any  intention to join NAFTA, the free trade agreement between the  United States, Canada, and Mexico. Last week Argentine  President Carlos Menem announced that in June he will begin  negotiations in this direction. During the "Critica &amp;  Autocritica" program, Foreign Minister Amorim clearly stated  that the Brazilian Government regards the Argentine Government's  initiative as a political initiative. Technically, he  explained, any negotiation for a Mercosur member to join NAFTA  should be carried out by the four Mercosur member countries,  according to the "Four Plus One" principle.    The foreign minister again insisted that there is no  disagreement with Argentina. Even the recent increase of  Argentine military expenditures with the purchase of weapons  (particularly the Skyhawk aircraft from the United States) --  which according to Argentina is to replace old equipment -- did  not cause any concern. Amorim commented that "if rivalry did  exist we would have not reached a nuclear agreement," referring  to the four-party, all-encompassing nuclear safeguard agreement  between Brazil, Argentina, the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for  Accounting and Control (ABACC), and the International Atomic  Energy Agency, an agreement for mutual control signed in 1991 in  Vienna and approved in early February by the Brazilian Senate.    This same agreement, which sets the ground for a better  relationship with Argentina as well as Germany, may have played  an important role, according to Celso Amorim, in solving  problems on another front, bilateral relations with the United  States.    Expressions of greater confidence in the country, such as  that by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who last week  suspended U.S. investigations regarding Brazil under the  so-called Super 301 law after acknowledging the Brazilian  commitment to approve its intellectual property protection draft  bill, represent a more broad-minded tendency, the foreign  minister believes.    "The United States wants the Brazilian economy to be  successful. It is the largest Latin America country, with which  the United States has the greatest trade volume after Mexico,  and where U.S. exports have increased significantly," Amorim  commented.    The fact that Brazil is trying to stabilize its economy also  had its impact on this change of attitude by the United States,  which gave signs that commercials sanctions would be applied  until a few days before the final decision. The minister said:  "The effort to stabilize the Brazilian economy was decisive."</p>

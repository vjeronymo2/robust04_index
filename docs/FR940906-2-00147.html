For example, agency personnel shall presume that an applicant can benefit from vocational rehabilitation services unless they can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the applicant is incapable of benefiting from vocational rehabilitation services in terms of an employment outcome. If an individual with a disability is dissatisfied with an eligibility determination or other decisions affecting the nature, scope, onset, duration, or other conditions of services, the applicant or recipient is entitled to a fair hearing before an impartial hearing officer under section 102(d) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An impartial hearing officer is defined in section 7(28) of the Act. Among the qualifications, the impartial hearing officer must have is knowledge of the delivery of vocational rehabilitation services, the State plan for rehabilitation services, and the Federal and State regulations governing the provision of services. Hearing officers are required in section 102(d)(2)(C) of the Act to be qualified to perform their official duties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One problem in training hearing officers is that there is a lack of an organized and accessible information base of hearing decisions and appeals such as is commonly found in our judicial system. Those compilations relate hearing decisions to State administrative case law, encourage the use of precedent in hearing decisions, provide evaluative data to State agencies on policies and practices that require revision or remediation, and provide information for use by the Federal Government in its monitoring responsibilities. A digest of hearing decisions and appeals, if published nationally, would also be of great benefit to multiple agencies, constituent groups, and Client Assistance Programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary intends to make an award with a project period of up to 36 months. The Secretary expects that the materials developed under this project would be used by projects funded under the State Vocational Rehabilitation Unit In-Service Training program, the Rehabilitation Continuing Education Program, and the Client Assistance Program training projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Priority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The project must_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Provide seminars and workshops for impartial hearing officers that address the many changes in due process requirements in the Act, including_(1) The rights and remedies for people with disabilities seeking services under Title I of the Act; and (2) The conduct of impartial hearings;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Develop model materials and decision compilations (including, if appropriate, computer-accessed compilations) for in-State and national dissemination of information on hearing decisions and appeals; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Provide training that is national in scope and training approaches and materials that, when replicated and adapted, are suited to train State rehabilitation agency staff and Client Assistance Program staff who have significant involvement with hearings and hearing officers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Applicable Program Regulations:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 34 CFR Part 390. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Program Authority:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 29 U.S.C. 774.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Training of Interpreters for Individuals Who are Deaf and Individuals Who are Deaf-Blind <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Purpose of Program:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this program is to assist in providing a sufficient number of skilled interpreters throughout the country for employment in public and private agencies, schools, and other service-providing institutions to meet the communication needs of individuals who are deaf and individuals who are deaf-blind by_(1) Training manual, tactile, oral, and cued speech interpreters; (2) Ensuring the maintenance of the skills of interpreters; and (3) Providing opportunities for interpreters to raise their level of competence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> For Further Information Contact:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Victor Galloway, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW., room 3228, Switzer Building, Washington, DC 20202&hyph;2736.

Each project has the discretion to provide training for interpreters for these two disability populations to the extent, and in the specific communication modes, appropriate to the needs of these populations in the geographical area to be served by the project. To participate in major life activities, increased numbers of individuals who are deaf-blind require skilled interpreting services. Interpreting for individuals who are deaf-blind is an intensive, one-to-one exercise, requiring significant skill. Expertise in the training of interpreters for individuals who are deaf-blind needs to be developed and made available to the field. A national project is needed that will give primary focus to training interpreters for individuals who are deaf-blind to better enable regional projects supported under this program to meet the communication needs of individuals who are deaf-blind. A national project is also needed to assist in improving the training of interpreters for individuals who are deaf.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

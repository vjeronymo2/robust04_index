			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Jobless up in Latin America Job growth in Latin America and the Caribbean cannot absorb the rapidly expanding labour supply in the region and unemployment is expected to rise slightly this year, the International Labour Organisation says. An ILO study on the impact of economic adjustment programmes from 1990 to 1993 in the region says unemployment is expected to reach 6.5 per cent this year, compared with 6 per cent in the period studied. Growth in the labour supply is estimated at 3.3 per cent this year because of a rise in the urban workforce, while jobs are projected to grow by 2.7 per cent.</p>

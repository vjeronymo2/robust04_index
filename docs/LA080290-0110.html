			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> L.A. COUNTY DEPUTY CHARGED IN SHOOTING;  </P> <P> CRIME: A COSTA MESA MAN WHOSE CAR BUMPED THE OFF-DUTY OFFICER'S MOTORCYCLE  ALLEGEDLY WAS CHASED AND SHOT.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy has been charged with assault for  allegedly chasing down a Costa Mesa man and shooting him after the two men were  involved in a traffic accident.  </P> <P> Gregory Cook, 40, faces a maximum 12-year prison term if he is convicted of the  charge filed against him Tuesday by the Orange County district attorney's  office.  </P> <P> Cook was charged with one count of assault, along with two special allegations  of using a firearm and inflicting great bodily injury, said Deputy Dist. Atty.  Clyde Von Der Ahe. Assault carries a maximum four-year term, but the special  allegations increase the possible penalty to 12 years, Von Der Ahe said.  </P> <P> Cook, who became a sheriff's deputy in 1977, had been working as a court  bailiff in a downtown Los Angeles courthouse until recently, but he was  reassigned to an administration job pending the outcome of the criminal case  against him, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Sgt. Katie Campbell.  </P> <P> The charges against Cook spring from an incident on the evening of April 28, a  Saturday, when he was off duty and riding a motorcycle in Long Beach. Reginald  Lamont Payne of Costa Mesa was driving a car on Westminster Avenue near  Studebaker Road when he hit the back of Cook's motorcycle.  </P> <P> Payne's lawyer, Gregory Silver, said Cook swung into Payne's lane suddenly and  Payne swerved to avoid him, but he still clipped Cook's motorcycle.  </P> <P> Angry, Cook pulled up alongside Payne at a traffic light and shouted a racial  epithet, then screamed that he was a police officer and that he had a gun but  displayed no police identification, Silver said.  </P> <P> When Cook reached into his left jacket pocket, Payne became frightened and took  off, triggering a chase into Seal Beach, Silver said.  </P> <P> Thinking that maybe Cook really was a police officer, Payne slowed down and  pulled into a lighted parking lot at the Rockwell International complex on Seal  Beach Boulevard, Silver said. When Cook caught up to him, Payne asked how he  could be sure Cook was an officer, but Cook shoved him against his car and  screamed at him, Silver said.  </P> <P> Payne broke free and began running, with Cook in pursuit on his motorcycle,  Silver said. A Rockwell security guard saw Cook chasing Payne on his cycle with  his revolver drawn and heard him fire five shots, Silver said. As Payne tried  to climb a fence, Cook fired, hitting Payne in the foot and the leg.  </P> <P> Silver said Cook's conduct violates Sheriff's Department policy, which forbids  use of a firearm when stopping someone for a misdemeanor charge. He said the  clash demonstrates that Cook is unsuitable for police work.  </P> <P> "What we had here was a minor traffic incident which unfortunately escalated  into what could have been a fatal shooting, all as a result of an individual  who never should have been carrying a gun in the first place," Silver said.  </P> <P> Silver said he plans to file a federal lawsuit against Cook, Los Angeles  County, the Board of Supervisors and Sheriff Sherman Block, alleging assault  and battery, negligence and deprivation of Payne's civil rights.  </P></p>

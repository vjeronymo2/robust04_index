			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> 1.2. Purpose of This Report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The purpose of this document is to: (1) articulate a view of neurotoxicity that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scientists generally hold in common today and (2) draw upon this understanding to compose,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as was done here by senior scientists from a number of Federal agencies, a series of general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principles that can be used to establish general guidelines for assessing neurotoxicity risk. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not the intent of this report to provide specific directives to agencies with respect to their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> own approach for neurotoxicity risk assessment. This document is intended to provide the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scientific basis for the development of a cogent strategy for neurotoxicology risk assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as needed by each agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of present gaps in understanding, the principles contained in this document  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are based on the best judgment of those involved in writing this document, as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements of what is generally accepted as fact. There has been, however, an attempt to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distinguish where possible between the different types of information presented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The principles contained in this document can serve as the basis for consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory neurotoxicology guidelines that the Federal agencies can tailor to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the legislative acts they are charged to implement. This document should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> viewed broadly as part of an ongoing process within the Federal Government to periodically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> update and review the current scientific understanding and regulatory utility of neurotoxicity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This document is the result of the combined efforts of senior scientists from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following Federal health-related units, operating under the direction of the Office of Science  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Technology Policy (OSTP):  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=4 --> Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consumer Product Safety Commission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Agriculture (USDA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Defense (DoD)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Protection Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR), FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Institutes of Health (NIH)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Toxicology Program (NTP)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> 1.3. Context of This Report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> This document was prepared in light of a decision-making process used by many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory agencies pertaining to the assessment of neurotoxicity risks posed by chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agents. The scientific basis for such assessment can be best understood by examining the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision-making process in some detail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Risk can be thought of as being composed of two aspects, each of which can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed by science, i.e., hazard and exposure assessment. Although other definitions have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been used historically, this document conforms to present usage. Hazard generally refers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the toxicity of a substance and is deduced from a wide array of data, including those from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> epidemiological studies or controlled clinical trials in humans, short- and long-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicological studies in animals, and studies of mechanistic information and structure-activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationships. Exposure generally refers to the amount of a substance with which people  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> come in contact. The risk in a quantitative risk assessment is estimated by considering the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results of the exposure and hazard assessments. As either the hazard or exposure approaches  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zero, the risk also approaches zero.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a first step in assessing the neurotoxic risk associated with the use of a particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical substance, the qualitative evidence that a given chemical substance is likely to be a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> human neurotoxicant must be evaluated. In this step, as in the whole process, a number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumptions and approximations must be made in order to deal with inherent limitations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found in the existing data bases. Then, estimates of human exposure and distribution of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposures likely to be encountered in the population are made. In the absence of dose- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response relationships in humans, one or more methods for estimating the dose-response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship including doses below those generally used experimentally must also be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated. Finally, the exposure assessment is combined with the dose-response relationship  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to generate an estimate of risk. The various ways in which these steps are conducted and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combined and their attendant uncertainties constitute what is generally referred to as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``neurotoxicity risk assessment.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some legislation calls for action in the presence of any risk. Other forms of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legislation use the concept of unreasonable risk, defined in some acts as a condition in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the risks outweigh the benefits. A spectrum of regulatory responses, from simply informing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the public of a risk through restricted use to a complete ban, may be available to bring the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risks and benefits into appropriate balance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This document does not perform a risk assessment nor does it suggest that one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method of neurotoxicology risk assessment is better than another. Rather, it attempts to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review the science of chemical neurotoxicology and develops from this review a set of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general principles. It is not a comprehensive review nor a document written for the lay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public; this document is a semitechnical review that evaluates the impact of scientific findings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the last decade on general assumptions or principles important to risk assessment. This is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on the belief that elucidation of the basic mechanisms underlying neurotoxicity and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identification of neurotoxic agents and conditions, when coupled to research aimed at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identifying and characterizing the problems caused by such agents, should provide the best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scientific bases for making sound and reasonable judgments. These overlapping approaches  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to evaluating the problems of neurotoxicology should form a strong foundation for decision-making.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> 1.4. Content of This Report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Including the Introduction (chapter 1), this document contains six chapters. Chapter 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides an overview of the discipline of neurotoxicology. It is important to understand the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scope of the problem as it relates to neurotoxicology, including: (1) Definitions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neurotoxicity and adverse effect, (2) examples of neurotoxicity and incidents of exposure,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (3) Federal response to neurotoxicology. Chapter 2 also discusses the basic principles of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicology that apply generally to the evaluation of neurotoxicity. Issues such as dose,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure, target site, and the intended use of the chemical are discussed, as are principles of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pharmacodynamics, chemical interactions, and the concept of threshold. Chapter 2 also lays  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the neurobiological basis for understanding how and where chemicals can affect the nervous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system and provides examples of such chemical types. Finally, chapter 2 discusses special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerations for neurotoxicology including the issue of susceptible populations, the blood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brain barrier, and the limited capability of the nervous system to repair following chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insult.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chapter 3 examines methods for assessing human neurotoxicity. Neurologic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluations, neuropsychological testing, and applicability of methods used in clinical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluations and case studies are discussed in this chapter. Epidemiologic study designs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endpoints, and methods are also discussed, as well as problems of causal inference and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications and limitations of epidemiologic and field study methods for risk assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chapter 3 also describes human laboratory exposure studies, including methods for assessing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neurobehavioral function, self-report methods for assessing subjective states, and a number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other methodological issues. This chapter also discusses the comparability of human and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> animal laboratory methods and special considerations in human neurotoxicity assessments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chapter 4 assesses methods for evaluating animal neurotoxicity. Discussed in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chapter is the role that animal models play in the assessment of chemicals for neurotoxicity,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the validity of animal models, and experimental design considerations in animal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neurotoxicological studies. Also included in this chapter is a discussion of tier-testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approaches in chemical evaluations. Specific endpoints used in animal neurotoxicological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> studies are also discussed, including methods for neurobehavioral, neurophysiological,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neuroanatomical, and neurochemical assessments. Developmental neurotoxicology and in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vitro neurotoxicology are also described in this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chapter 5 of this document discusses principles of neurotoxicity risk assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This chapter evaluates the generic assumptions in neurotoxicity risk assessment, ending with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a discussion of uncertainty reduction and identification of knowledge gaps.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chapter 6 is a general summary of the material presented in the first five chapters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

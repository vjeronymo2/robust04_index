			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Emerging Markets: Tel Aviv declines against a rosy background - The Emerging Investor The figures make depressing reading. The Tel Aviv stock exchange has been declining steadily for the past five months and at the end of last week the general share index stood at 185.45 - a slight improvement on the previous week's 20-month trough of 176.21, but still far from its mid-January height of 258.36. The index yesterday closed at 189.21. In May alone, the average investor lost 27 per cent on share dealings and, that same month, companies traded on the exchange lost Shk37bn (about Dollars 12bn) in paper value. Although most of the day to day falls have been minor, the cumulative effect has analysts comparing the decline to crashes in years past. Particular comparisons are drawn with October 1983, when revelations of an illegal bank share manipulation sent shares into free fall, losing by as much as 90 per cent of their value. Yet the spring and early summer of 1994 have seen no hint of any similar widespread stock market scandal. And, in contrast to other past rapid market declines, the economy is generally in buoyant shape. Prof Jacob Frenkel, the governor of the Bank of Israel, has predicted 5 per cent growth in the economy this year, with 8 per cent growth in exports and unemployment levels falling from 10 per cent to 8.5 per cent. So with such an apparently rosy economic background, why is the stock market plunging? And why is investor confidence so low when the exchange has attracted an estimated Dollars 2.5bn in foreign investment, which increased tenfold between 1988 and 1993, and rose 25.5 per cent in 1993? A group of economists on the Knesset Finance Committee Capital Markets Subcommittee has attempted to find explanations. Mr Sam Bronfeld, the director of the Tel Aviv stock exchange, asserted that the non-appearance of an anticipated 'peace dividend' following the Israeli-PLO agreement on limited autonomy for the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area of the West Bank was a significant factor. The market had risen on hopes of accelerated growth and massive new investment following last September's White House signing of the framework peace accords. But it was now falling amid realisation that such investment was slow in coming. Analysts have also pinned some blame on the crisis surrounding Kupat Holim Clalit, Israel's largest health insurance fund, now on the brink of collapse with debts of Shk1.2bn. Only a few large pharmaceutical companies have so far been directly affected. But hundreds of private companies that supply the health fund are now braced for a blow, and the economy as a whole will be asked to share the burden. While these factors may have played some part perhaps a more significant cause has been the disappointing first quarter results reported by many companies. Dozens of companies held back from issuing their results until the final deadline two weeks ago, and almost across the board there were reports of falling turnovers and declining profits. Excuses were many and various. They included falling prices worldwide (in the case of the giant Israel Chemicals concern, for example); on increased competition (which hit the Tempo beer and soft drinks company, marketer of Pepsi in Israel); on shekel-dollar exchange rate fluctuations unfavourable to exporters; on staff salary increases stemming from good company performances last year; and on the falls on the stock exchange itself, where many companies had invested surplus funds. Mr Yair Sidel, who reports on the Tel Aviv stock exchange for Israel Radio, said that the instability of the market had now reduced foreign investment to a minimum and led to the scuppering of plans by a leading French bank to set up a multi-million dollar fund to invest in the exchange. The Israeli bond market has escaped the worst of the falls, with the big Israeli banks among the chief purchasers. But the stock exchange malaise has now spread to the New York exchange, where about 50 Israeli companies are traded. The New York-traded Israeli shares began slipping after the Hebron mosque massacre on February 25, said Mr Howard Sterling, managing director of Corporate Finance at Oscar Gruss investment brokers in Tel Aviv. 'Seeing the falls in Tel Aviv, the Americans simply followed suit,' he said. But, he added, the 'selling frenzy' has eased off a little in the past three weeks. 'Share values have fallen to the point where people are starting to buy again,' he said, 'and the forecasts are good. The fundamentals are positive. Israel's high-tech prospects are as good as Silicon Valley's were in the 1970s.' Analysts are hoping that the Tel Aviv exchange will now follow that faint lead from New York. The Bank of Israel is also trying to restore stability with new regulations limiting how much credit banks may offer customers to finance stock market investment. Mr Moshe Mandelbaum, the former Bank of Israel governor, asserted on June 8 that the market had probably now reached its lowest point. And, said Mr Amiram Sivan, chief executive officer of Bank Hapoalim, Israel's biggest bank, 'there is no economic reason for the falling share prices.' But unless there is a sustained rally, said Mr Yerah Nissan, deputy managing director of Bank Hamizrahi, a real crisis of faith could develop, bringing panic selling. That kind of crisis would have deep implications for the government's already slow-moving privatisation programme. Indeed, when only last week the government announced plans to sell 51 per cent of its holding in El Al, the national airline, the first question analysts asked was whether the offer would find subscribers in the declining Israeli market. Most analysts are agreed on one thing: the market and the economic atmosphere overall could benefit from a firmer display of financial management by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and his government. Mr Avraham Shochat, the finance minister, and Mr Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, the housing minister, are widely criticised for their failure to halt the soaring house prices which are fuelling inflation. In a week that included an Israeli air strike against Hizbollah guerrillas in Lebanon and numerous crises stemming from the Palestinian autonomy accord, Israel's newspapers consistently featured the stock market falls as front page news. Yet when Mr Shochat was asked to comment on the market slump he merely replied that, yes, 'there is a crisis on the stock exchange. But the economy is really moving, and eventually the stock exchange will adjust itself to the economy, not the other way around.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                          3/6/94                                          Dollars  Week on week change Stock                          Country   close    Dollars        %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cukurova Elektrik               Turkey   0.2047   0.0634      33.73 Guney Biracilik                 Turkey   0.9414   0.2227      30.99 Eregli Demir Ve Celik           Turkey   0.1759   0.0383      27.84 Doktas                          Turkey   0.4475   0.0959      27.25 Banco De Brasil (Pfd)           Brazil   0.0189   0.0037      24.22 Koc Holding                     Turkey   0.6173   0.1127      22.33 Otosan                          Turkey   1.7593   0.2914      19.85 Ege Biracilik                   Turkey   2.4383   0.3893      19.00 Koc Yatrim                      Turkey   1.0957   0.1630      17.47 Companhia Cervejaria Brahma     Brazil   0.2595   0.0329      14.52  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Athens, April 11, IRNA -- Two western insurance  companies were targets of bomb attacks in the Greek capital  during the early hours of Monday. The Greek urban guerrilla  group `17 November' claimed credit for the attacks against the  U.S. firm 'Aleco' and the Dutch 'National Nederlande' both  situated on the busy Kifissias Avenue in the suburb of Maroussi.    The group used a rocket to hit the building housing `Aleco'  and placed a time-bomb in the other nearby building in which  National Nederlande was to move in. The explosions caused  material damages but nobody was hurt.    An anonymous caller told the Greek private radio station  `Sky' that `17 November' was taking responsibility for the  attacks. He also claimed that the group had placed a bazooka on  a British aircraft carrier ten days ago. The carrier `Ark  Royal' docked in the port of Piraeus since 28 March is to leave  the harbour Monday. The caller did not give any further  information and the Greek police have denied any knowledge of  the incident.    It was the fifteenth rocket attack by `17 November'. The 3.5  inch rockets had been stolen by the group from military depots  in the past.</p>

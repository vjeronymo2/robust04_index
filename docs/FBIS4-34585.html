			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Patricia Almaraz] </F>   [Text] As of today the Bolivian Labor Federation (COB) will  begin a new period that will not merely be a continuation of the  present. According to what was observed, the big difference is  that the COB no longer has the support of the miners, its  political guidelines are linked to those of the current  government and are without structural changes.    After 10 days of meetings, the 10th COB Congress concluded  early on the morning of 10 June in the city of Tarija. The  expectations of its members and of the government itself were  focused on that congress, awaiting the consolidation or  rejection of the theories of change and organizational and  internal adjustments to the COB.    But the reorganization did not take place, and the congress  ratified the COB as a "classist and labor" union organization  that recognizes the importance of those who do not earn a wage,  receives them as important allies, admits their numerical  importance, while the political and ideological lines are  established by the proletariat.    Unlike in previous years, the COB will be led by a union  leader and guided by a political document which follows that  ideological trend: Oscar Salas of the Democratic Socialist  Alternative (ASD).    For the first time in its history, the COB will not have the  support of one of the most important sectors: the miners. The  COB executive secretary, who was reelected, said this will  surely weaken the organization a bit.    Opposed to this idea, the most radical within the union  claim  the result of the congress could increase a polarization of  positions at the grassroots in the absence of a board that  represents the demands of all members.    In an unusual form of election, Salas and the executive  committee that will accompany him during the next two years were  elected by designation of each of the sectors and not by the  congress, which is the top union authority.    The designation of Executive Secretary Oscar Salas and of  Finance Secretary Carlos Camargo was established after they left  the congress; the installation of the new union board was held  in absence of the top leader and half of the congress  participants.    The organization of the executive committee which will be  led  by Oscar Salas does -- as he himself admitted -- strongly favor  parties of the government coalition, 50 percent in total. Among  them are leaders of the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary  Movement], of the MBL [Free Bolivia Movement], and of the UCS  [Solidarity Civic Union], while the rest comprises the ASD, Eje  Pachacuti [Pachacuti Axis Movement], Comunero, Condepa  [Conscience of the Fatherland], MIR [Movement of the  Revolutionary Left], FRI [Revolutionary Front of the Left], POR  [Revolutionary Workers Party], and the PIE [expansion unknown]  of the Filemon Escobar trend.    Salas said this has little importance because during the  previous administration the COB was fully controlled by the  Patriotic Accord.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Amal Sa'd: "For First Time, Real Jobs for </F> Graduates; Youth Still `Anxious' Over Government Employment,  Preferring It to Private Employment; Looking for Stability,  Family Aspect, and Insurance, Graduates Say Yes to Government  Employment; Appointment of 55,000 Graduates to Government  Apparatus to Meet Actual Needs at Work Sites; Conversion  Training and Amendment of Labor Laws Are Essential for Stable  Labor Market"]    [Text] Within the context of the government policy to  create real work opportunities for the youth, the Ministry of  Manpower announced that it has agreed to hire 55,000 college and  high school graduates who have graduated since 1983 in an effort  to break the unemployment siege from which youth suffer. Are  there actual specialized positions and jobs awaiting these youth  or will the appointees turn into more of the masked unemployed  with which ministries and government agencies abound? Is there  demand for appointment? How will the appointees be treated in  terms of salaries and social allowances? How did the youth spend  the recent years before their turn to be appointed arrived?  <H5>  Appointment to Real Jobs </H5>   Muhammad Amin Mahfuz, general director of employment at the  Ministry of Manpower, has said, "For the first time, this year  we are following a new policy of appointment to real jobs in  order to meet actual needs. Youth with high school diplomas will  be appointed according to grade point average and those with  college degrees, according to general evaluation. Unlike what  happened in past years, not all graduates of the same year will  be appointed, because this system has proved to be a failure and  because it has resulted in masked unemployment that saddles the  government with enormous financial burdens, with nothing  produced in return. This year, there is an actual need to make a  total of 54,066 appointments in order to meet the shortage in a  number of government agencies, including the Ministry of  Education, al-Azhar, local government agencies, the Ministries  of Health, Social Affairs, and Agriculture, the Public Book  Authority, and the Higher Youth and Sports Council. The Ministry  is committed to making these appointments by the end of April.  The Domestic Employment Department has prepared its plan to  complete the appointment of graduates from among the graduates  of 1983 to 1993. Different levels of qualification are required  from the classes graduating in different years. [High school and  college level] qualifications are required of 1983 graduates.  College degrees are required of 1984 graduates (like this year's  main class). From the years 1985 to 1993, honors graduates are  needed.    "For example, graduates of Islamic law colleges, law  schools,  arts sections, documentation, and library sections from 1984 to  1993 [will be appointed]. Graduates of 1992 were appointed last  year, and 1993 graduates, as well as graduates from previous  years who haven't been given jobs, will be appointed this year.  Graduates of English, Arabic, French, and other language  sections and of al-Azhar colleges from 1984 to 1992 will also be  appointed. The required number of appointees from each  educational level will be selected according to specialization  and from the year entitled to appointment, and then from  subsequent years."  <H5>  New Unemployment </H5>   "Even though this new system will, as Muhammad Mahfuz says,  eliminate the masked unemployment phenomenon because it calls  for appointment to meet actual needs, it may lead to  unemployment among graduates of colleges which aren't in demand,  such as schools of arts and oriental language schools. This  requires correction of the educational direction (as a long-term  plan) to make it compatible with the market's actual needs and  to give the new generations skills that enable them to work for  themselves on the one hand and, on the other hand, to create new  venues for the appointment of these graduates in small projects.    "This correction also requires focusing on the role of  conversion training to divert employees toward truly productive  jobs and to create private sector associations so each  association will appoint its own members, solve their problems,  conduct feasibility studies for their projects, and train them.  There is no doubt that the ministry has a role to play in  drafting plans for projects to be undertaken by graduates. A  conversion training plan (for a two-month training course) has  been prepared with the Ministry of Education for graduates of  psychology, philosophy, and oriental languages so they will be  trained on documentation and library tasks and will work as  librarians. No plan has been drawn up yet for graduates of other  theoretical colleges and high schools. However, there is an  urgent need for such a plan, especially when we learn that high  school graduates represent 75 percent of the unemployed  [graduates] generally. College graduates represent just 12  percent and graduates with above high school diplomas represent  the remaining 13 percent. We must note here, as the general  director of internal employment has said, that vocational  conversion training must be compatible with every group of  graduates independently. Else, we must enhance the qualification  level of the graduates of each group within their own  specialization so as to make them compatible with the private  sector's needs.    "As for the financial position of the graduates who are to  be  appointed, they will collect the established salaries, namely  64.80 [pounds] as a basic salary for college graduates and 51.30  pounds as a basic salary for graduates with high school  diplomas. Social and periodic allowances will be certainly added  to these salaries. Law No. 47 of 1978 will apply to the  appointees and they will be granted legal seniority as of 1  February 1994, giving them the full opportunity to receive their  first allowance as of 1 July 1995."  <H5>  Demand for Appointment </H5>   As to the degree of demand for these appointments, Mahmud  'Askar, chairman of the section for appointment of graduates  with a business diploma at the Ministry of Manpower, has said  that there is an extremely strong demand for the jobs and that  some of the applicants are unemployed and others are actually  employed in the private sector but wish to either combine this  employment with government employment or to completely give up  the former and take up the latter. Some of the applicants even  avoid making insurance payments of their own volition and avoid  insuring themselves while employed in the private sector so as  to get the opportunity for government employment when their turn  comes. It is well known that an insured private-sector worker is  totally excluded from government employment. Moreover, we do not  exaggerate if we assert that some groups, especially  self-employed free professionals, avoid insuring themselves so  as to get an opportunity to work for the government and then to  carry on with their self-employment after official work hours.    'Askar went on to add that all applications will be checked  by computer at the Ministry of Social Affairs to verify whether  applicants are or are not actually employed, so vacant positions  will be filled by the unemployed and not by people who wish to  combine two jobs.  <H5>  Youths' Opinion </H5>   We had to interview a sampling of the youth who have applied  for appointment, especially 1983 or 1984 graduates who have  spent nearly 10 years awaiting a letter from the Ministry of  Manpower and who have been forced to take up jobs totally  unrelated to their specializations. To begin, we assert that  clinging to government employment has been the basic thread  binding all graduates we have interviewed. However, their  justifications and their wishes vary in this regard. Some wish  to give up their private sector work altogether and others wish  to combine it with government employment.    'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Atiyah Muhammad, who got a BS in chemistry in  1984, works as a railroad conductor. He has said, "My wages from  my work amount to 200 pounds monthly because I get additional  wages for fines that I collect. I know that my government salary  will not amount to one-half this sum. However, I wish to work in  my field of specialization, which I love, and I am prepared to  give up my current job for its sake."    Layla Mahmud al-Qirabi, who got a licence [equivalent of MA]  in English literature in 1989, works as a switch operator at a  major hotel and earns 350 pounds monthly. She wishes to work as  a teacher, and she is willing to accept a salary that will not  exceed 86 pounds under any circumstance. She has said, "I have  to sacrifice the big salary from my current job because this job  requires me to work evening and morning shifts, which isn't  convenient to me as a wife and a mother. I am looking for  government work that ensures me comfort, regular work hours, and  maternity leave."    Ramzi Judah 'Abd-al-Baqi, who got a business diploma in  1983,  is a citizen of al-Sharqiyah Governorate. He has been unable to  work in his governorate due to the lack of employment  opportunities there. So, he came to Cairo and worked at a  restaurant and confectionery. When his turn to be appointed by  the Ministry of Manpower came, he did not hesitate to apply and  to express his willingness to leave his current job, which pays  him 300 pounds monthly. Ramzi justifies his willingness by  pointing out that his work is extremely demanding and that he  works 12-15 hours daily. Moreover, he feels that the job is  unstable and insecure and he fears that the business owner may  terminate his contract at any moment.  <H5>  Family Appearance </H5>   Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Sa'idi, who obtained a business  diploma  in 1983 and who works as a tile layer, has said, "I hate this  job. I have been forced to work in it in order to spend on my  needs. I collect 20 pounds daily or 600 pounds monthly. But now  I wish to work in my field of specialization so as to preserve  proper family and social appearances."    Mujdi Mahmud, who received a BA in commerce and business  management in 1984 and who works as a teacher at a private  school, wishes to be appointed by the Ministry of Manpower so he  can get his full due, in terms of promotion, allowances, and the  right to do rotations, plus wages for the entire year. In his  current position, Mahmud gets no salary for the school summer  vacation months.    Nabil Khalifah, a French language graduate in 1985, works as  a security officer at a major five-star hotel. He has said, "I  don't wish to give up my current job, in which my work ends at  0600. I can then go to my government job and secure a reasonable  monthly salary with which to face the high cost of living.  Moreover, government jobs are stable."    Samir Fadil 'Abd-al-Jawad, who got a BS in geology in 1984  and who works as a typist at a private company, has said, "I  wish to work in the government in the morning and then carry on  with my current job after the official work hours because this  job is a source of livelihood for me and my family. This is, in  any case, better than going abroad."  <H5>  Problem of Laws </H5>   Dr. 'Izzah Karim, a sociologist at the National Social and  Criminal Research Center, has said, "In the youth's mind,  employment in the private or public sector has a specific  significance and specific logic that are based on the Egyptian  society's laws and circumstances. The pursuit of government jobs  started with the inception of the 1952 revolution and with  application of the socialist system. This system strengthens the  government sector with laws that regulate it and ensure a stable  monthly salary, insurance, and pensions in case of sickness or  death. These laws do not permit the dismissal of a worker except  under extreme circumstances, and they do not require full and  conditional productivity. These guarantees motivate the youth to  seek government employment. This is in contrast with the private  sector whose regulations cause the youth constant anxiety, even  though this sector's wages are high. But the wage may be  unstable and may depend on profit. Moreover, the assurances that  the private sector worker gets may not be enough to make this  worker feel secure about his future and old age. Therefore,  youth cannot be blamed if they are determined to pursue  government employment.    "As for combining private and government employment, it can  be excusable despite its numerous demerits--most significant of  which is that the worker is required to exert a redoubled effort  which could damage his health and cause him to be delinquent in  performing his duties to himself, his family, and his society.  Another demerit is that this worker denies other unemployed  people the opportunity for real employment at a time when we are  experiencing high unemployment. If we view this matter more  logically, we can perhaps find an excuse for youth who do not  wish to tackle the difficult task of balancing a rewarding  income from the private sector on the one hand with security and  stability from government employment on the other hand."  <H5>  Wasteful Spending </H5>   Here, Dr. 'Izzah Karim raises another point connected with  the same issue, namely the years spent by the youth while  waiting for appointment. These years are either spent in true  unemployment--and there is no doubt that 10 years of  unemployment are sure to destroy the youth educationally and  psychologically and to turn them into a time bomb threatening to  explode at any moment because the youth feel intellectually  empty and unable to contribute to society--or spent in a job  totally unrelated to the youth's specialization and field of  studies. Even though this is less harmful than complete  unemployment, it is still an enormous problem because it  represents money spent wastefully by the government. This is a  problem because it means that all the money spent on the student  throughout the various phases of education goes to waste and no  benefit is derived from this spending. Moreover, the worker  [graduate student] works in a job he does not like, to which he  does not belong, that does not satisfy his identity, and that  afflicts him with psychological diseases that make him want to  retaliate against society. This is definitely a problem of a  government that grants high school certificates and that does  not create work opportunities to absorb people with such  certificates, despite the numerous work opportunities in Egypt.  We should keep in mind that we live on just 4 percent of Egypt's  area and that the other 96 percent remains unproductive and  absorbs no manpower. Thus, the problem lies in the poor  population distribution and not in population growth.    Finally, the sociologist at the National Social Research  Center offers a prescription to overcome this crisis that Egypt  experiences annually. She says that the solution lies in two  things: first, have the government begin drafting public sector  laws that protect this sector's labor at all levels so people  will seek employment in the sector seriously and more  courageously. The problem is a problem of laws and not of the  nature of work in the sector.    Second, attention must not be confined to the overcrowded  mother governorates but must be directed to the new governorates  that are capable of absorbing the youth's capabilities and that  can employ the youth and enable him to achieve immense  productivity far from the government sector.</p>

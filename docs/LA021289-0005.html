			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> After watching the newly extended "Home" program, I've decided to express my  opinion. I am disappointed as to how it has changed. Those things that made the  show a success just aren't there anymore, such as the information on improving  one's home or creative ideas for one's hobbies. Seems as if "Home" has become  just another talk show. Also, Sandy Hill was a wonderful hostess and I think  Cristina Ferrare should have stayed on "AM."  </P> <P> Elizabeth Sanchez, Norwalk  </P></p>

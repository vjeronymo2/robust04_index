			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ST. JOSEPH LEAVES TRAUMA CARE SETUP  </P> <P> St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank withdrew from Los Angeles County's trauma  network Monday, leaving officials from nearby hospitals fearing an increase in  the number of critically ill patients they must treat.  </P> <P> "We're not adding any more staff to handle the expected increase, but  psychologically we're gearing up," said John McConnellogue, director of  Northridge Hospital Medical Center's emergency department.  </P> <P> St. Joseph officials announced in April that they were dropping out of the  network because of a lack of funds.  </P> <P> "We will no longer have a general surgeon on duty 24 hours a day like before,"  a St. Joseph spokeswoman said. "But we will still have a full basic emergency  department."  </P> <P> Ten of 23 hospitals have dropped out of the county's trauma care network since  it was formed in 1984.  </P></p>

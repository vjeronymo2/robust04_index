			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Technology: A model range - CD-Roms are making life easier for a number of businesses At its Face of 1994 competition at the Grosvenor House last week, Storm Management became the first UK model agency to put its portfolio on CD-Roms, small plastic discs on which vast amounts of information can be stored and retrieved. The CD-Roms, which showed 250 models (six images of each), together with some video clips, were given 'a tremendous response' by the photographers and casting directors present, according to Simon Chambers, a Storm director. Instead of thumbing through a bulky catalogue, Storm's clients are now able to search the database looking for models that meet a particular criteria such as height or hair colour. Moreover, the CD-Rom is cheaper to mail than Storm's glossy brochure, allowing the agency to send out quarterly updates. The model catalogue is one example of the way in which CD-Rom technology is making inroads into business. An expanding range of business CD-Rom titles are being produced by companies for their own use and by external publishers. Many large companies now have CD-Rom libraries which stock annual reports, newspapers, legal information, market research and reference works, as well as producing their own discs for marketing or training purposes. Although specialist discs can cost thousands of pounds, prices can be less than Pounds 1 a disc for companies printing them in large volumes. Within businesses the potential for CD-Roms is most likely to be seen in sales departments, which are keen to exploit the ability to combine text, video, sound and graphics. 'Sales people are clamouring for multimedia presentation tools,' says Todd Harris, editor-in-chief of CD-Rom World, a magazine based in Westport, Connecticut. Training departments are also enthusiastic users of CD-Roms. For example, in April 1993, Abbey National, the UK building society, replaced computer-based training with CD-Rom training packages because of their stronger visual impact and their interactivity. Hyster Europe, the forklift truck distributor, has distributed training information on CD-Rom to dealers throughout Europe. It found that even small workshops were prepared to invest in the hardware to use the discs. 'There was far less resistance than we initially expected,' says Roy Jackson, dealer support co-ordinator. CD-Rom technology also allows companies to present vast amounts of information in a manageable and revisable form. Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, uses quarterly-updated CD-Roms to alert its staff to changes in accounting and legal regulations throughout the world. Many companies are putting their technical manuals on CD-Rom. The RAC has invested Pounds 500,000 in storing its patrol teams' technical manuals on CD-Rom using Panasonic 'electronic book' players. The discs, which replace 30m sheets of paper a year, are able to store extra information, including local car dealerships and members' entitlements. Because patrols no longer have to carry bulky manuals, they are able to fit in an extra part or passenger into a car. Pilot trials suggest also that the electronic books are easier to use, allowing patrols to fix more faults at the roadside. The proliferation of CD-Rom titles is also fuelled by publishers. Mecklermedia, a publisher based in London and Westport, Connecticut, which produces a directory, CD-Roms in Print, calculates that the number of published titles has reached nearly 6,000, up from 3,500 last year. Many of these titles use the immense storage capacity of CD-Roms to accommodate large databases, telephone directories and mailing lists on a single disc, which makes them a useful tool for direct marketers. Training packages are also popular, with titles such as the New Dynamics of Winning and The Secrets of Executive Success. Another category of CD-Roms are those which provide graphics to help with desktop publishing and business presentations. Detailed information on companies and industries is also available - for a price. For example, Kompass UK, with details on 140,000 top companies, costs Pounds 4,200. Pira International, the UK paper and packaging industry's research association, has launched a disc that includes market statistics, company profiles and new products for Pounds 2,570 a year. Many of these CD-Rom titles run on Windows or Macintosh, which are relatively easy to use. However, many discs aimed at the business market are known as 'professional' CDs, which often have complicated command structures. Some discs have limited access, either in the number of times it is used or the length of time it can be used. The number of available titles is likely to increase as CD-Rom players are more widely used. At present, only 7 per cent of PCs installed have CD-Rom players, according to Primary Research, a New York-based company. 'Although the total number of CD-Roms is small, we expect to see an explosion in their number,' says Harris. The surge in the amount of information available from CD-Roms and on-line information services is giving businesses quicker and easier access to more information than ever before. But at the same time, it is making the task of sifting and filtering the data more acute. 'People are beginning to feel distressed by the volume of data sources available to them. The major challenge now is managing the provision of information,' says Toby Stephens, a senior manager at Price Waterhouse's technology group.</p>

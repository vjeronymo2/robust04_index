			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / UN meeting on N Korea reactor rods The US, South Korea and Japan will consult tomorrow at the United Nations to discuss their response to North Korea's refusal to allow full international inspection of its nuclear programme. North Korea has so far failed to comply with a statement issued by the UN Security Council on Monday urging it to stop removing spent fuel rods from its 5MW reactor. The International Atomic Energy Agency wants to select and examine the spent nuclear fuel to determine whether North Korea has diverted plutonium from the reactor for its suspected nuclear weapons programme. In an apparent show of force, North Korea on Tuesday conducted a test launch of a domestic version of the Chinese-designed Silkworm anti-ship missile. Meanwhile, South Korean armed forces were placed on a routine high state of alert following the departure of President Kim Young-sam on a week-long visit to Russia and Uzbekistan. North Korea may be within days of completing the removal of the fuel rods and ending any chance of the IAEA conducting an independent analysis of them to trace past nuclear activities. The US has warned if North Korea passes this threshold, its negotiations with Pyongyang will be broken off and Washington will ask the UN Security Council for economic sanctions against the North. The North has warned that sanctions would be considered 'an act of war'. The IAEA on Tuesday urged North Korea to accept 'technical options which might still at this late stage of discharge. . . preserve the agency's ability to verify the history of the (reactor's) core.' The IAEA rejected North Korea's proposed procedures to select and store the fuel rods for later examination, explaining that it 'would not enable the agency to identify' where the rods had been located in the reactor core. 'Without such identification, future measurements (of the fuel rods) would be meaningless and the agency's ability to verify non-diversion would be lost,' it said. North Korea is putting the discharged fuel rods into a storage tank 'after writing the location and serial numbers on the rods, with monitoring cameras operating', a North Korean diplomat was quoted as saying in Vienna. The IAEA will be able to examine the fuel rods once North Korea and the US conclude a package deal on diplomatic normalisation and economic aid, he added. North Korea is refusing the IAEA's demands because it claims a special status under the nuclear safeguards treaty since it has only 'suspended' its threatened withdrawal from the treaty last year.</p>

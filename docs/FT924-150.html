			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Leslie Wise founder dies MR LESLIE WISE, executive chairman and founder of the eponymous textile and women's wear group, has died. Mr Wise, who was in his 70s, died on December 26. It is likely that a non-executive chairman will be appointed in his stead. For the past 10 years the Leicester-based group has, in effect, been run by Mr Wise's son, Neil, who is chief executive, and Mr John Gowers, managing direc-tor. The Leslie Wise Group, which came to the stock market in 1958 as Rudkin &amp; Laundon, supplies women's wear to retailers such as Burton and Etam as well as merchanting textiles. In July, it announced a 12 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.51m on turnover 25 per cent ahead to Pounds 22.8m.</p>

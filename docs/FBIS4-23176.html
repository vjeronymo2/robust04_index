			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 27 SAPA -- The PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] housing and local government  ministry said on Friday [27 May] it had noted with great concern  the alarming upsurge in land occupations in the province. The  areas affected included Vanderbijlpark, Johannesburg, Nancefield  and Randburg, the ministry said in a statement. "The ministry  recognises the deprivations of the past and the shortages of  houses for the majority in the PWV region. But it is of the  view that such campaigns were aimed at the previous government,  which closed all avenues of addressing basic and fundamental  demands of our people."    A new situation had developed in the country. A government  elected on the basis of the will of the people was now firmly in  power, and it had stated publicly its commitment to the  Reconstruction and Development Programme which would ensure the  basic demands of the people were met. "The ministry, with the  private sector, is in a process of developing a programme aimed  at alleviating the housing shortage in our province. In this  regard, the (provincial) government has committed itself to  providing 150,000 housing units in this current financial year."    The ministry believed continued occupations might lead to  unnecessary tensions, fuel animosities and create a climate  conducive for third force elements to exploit and undermine  programmes of the democratic government. "The ministry will  organise an urgent meeting with all interested parties to seek  ways and means of resolving the current impasse and to ensure  the development of a people-centred programme to alleviate the  problem. In this context, the ministry appeals for a moratorium  on new land occupations pending the outcome of such  consultations. The ministry will also hold urgent discussions  with the Transvaal provincial administration to ensure an end to  the harassment of our people."</p>

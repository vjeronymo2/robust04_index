			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Pick 'n Pay ahead 10% at R93m in tough trading PICK 'n Pay Stores, South Africa's largest supermarket chain, yesterday posted a 10 per cent rise in net profits to R93m (Dollars 29.3m) for the year to February 1993, from R84.4m the year before, Reuter reports from Cape Town. Earnings per share advanced to 59.3 cents from 53.9 cents - taking account of a two-for-one share split last November. The directors have recommended a final dividend of 26.25 cents a share, making 33.5 cents for the year, against 28.75 cents the previous year. Trading profits moved up to R146.2m, from R131.2m, on turnover R510,000 ahead at R6.42bn. After net interest income of R13.9m, against R3.4m, and investment income of R1.2m, compared with R11.2m, pre-tax profits emerged R22.3m higher at R161.3m. Tax took R68.3m, compared with R54.6m. The group expects tough trading conditions for at least another year but is confident it can show continued earnings growth, AP-DJ reports. Mr Raymond Ackerman, chairman and chief executive said a staff productivity deal was likely and 10 new stores were planned. A 4 per cent rise in South Africa's value added tax could depress consumer spending briefly, but inflation was falling and turnover growth of 8 to 10 per cent would be enough to keep ahead of inflation, rather than the 10 to 15 per cent needed recently.</p>

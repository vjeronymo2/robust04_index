In reaction to  media reports, the IDF spokesman wants to make it clear that the  IDF command in Judaea and Samaria has not approved the march,  slated to be conducted under the slogan "All Israel Is Hebron,"  and that the IDF will not safeguard it. It was also decided to  prevent entry into Hebron on the day of the march to anybody who  is not a town resident.    The body of a person suspected of collaboration with Israel,  Muhammad 'Ali Abu-'Ata, 28, a resident of the Rimal  neighborhood, was found near a garbage dump in Gaza. Local  residents told our correspondent Moti Amir that Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement] 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam members murdered him  since he participated in several IDF actions against wanted  Hamas people. According to them, more than six months ago Hamas  members murdered Abu-'Ata's brother for similar reasons.</p>

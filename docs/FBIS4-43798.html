			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi and the delegation  accompanying him arrived in Brussels today. Soon after his  arrival, he held preliminary talks with Belgian officials and  representatives of our community there. Over to Rachida Hamadi  from Brussels:    [Hamadi] Indeed. Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi and the  delegation accompanying him are now continuing their meeting  with our community in Belgium at the Algerian embassy. Mr.  Mokdad Sifi arrived in Belgium at noon today. He met Arab  ambassadors and held his expected meeting with Belgian Prime  Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. The meeting lasted over one hour.  Mr. Dehaene is tipped as the candidate to succeed Jacques  Delors as president of the European Commission.    [Begin Dehaene recording in French with superimposed Arabic  translation] Relations between Belgium and Algeria have always  been good; there have been constant commercial and economic  links. This meeting falls within the framework of efforts aimed  at strengthening these relations. [end recording]    [Hamadi] The purpose of this European tour, which comes on  the eve of the European summit in Corfu and less than one month  before the G-7 summit in Naples, is to bolster European-Algerian  cooperation in various fields, particularly after the agreement  with the IMF and the Paris Club. Observers here point out that  Algeria has invigorated the political and economic reforms by  establishing the Transitional National Council and the National  Economic and Social Council, and has opened the first door to a  market economy. They add that all these facts will give Algeria  a winning card in its international economic dealings.    [Begin Sifi recording] The visit has several objectives. We  will be disseminating information that will enable us to explain  the Algerian Government's efforts in the political and economic  fields. This visit is also aimed at developing and bolstering  support in the political and economic fields. [end recording]  [passage omitted]    The prime minister will leave Belgium tomorrow for Paris on  a  similar mission.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] I think there is a possibility that Lyuben Berov's  statement on cabinet changes, which he is expected to make this  Thursday, will receive greater parliamentary support, Aleksandur  Tomov, leader of the Civic Alliance for the Republic [GOR],  declared after his meeting with Ahmed Dogan, leader of the DPS  [Movement for Rights and Freedoms].    Today we may expect a very important development in the  position of the New Alliance for Democracy [NSD] on approving  the cabinet changes, assuming of course the demands of the  parties making up the NSD are satisfied, Tomov told our reporter  Antoaneta Puncheva. One should not permit any single political  force to dominate the cabinet, Tomov said, because in such a  situation it is certain that the cabinet will fall.    Aleksandur Tomov stated at a news conference held earlier  that the GOR will issue a statement on the government changes  and a statement on the government's intentions at the plenary  session of parliament as soon as they are finally drafted.</p>

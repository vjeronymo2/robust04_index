			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CARTER STILL LOOKING FOR A NEW ADDRESS  </P> <P> He treated all of New York to a mile of smiles during the previous five  seasons. Three months after removing his Mets' uniform for the last time, Gary  Carter presented another face to a select audience. For a few moments, he was  the catcher caught in a cry.  </P> <P> Although the tools of his trade included a mask, Carter never hid behind it.  For better or worse, he laid bare his feelings. Mostly, they were happy. Even  the passing was no worse than bittersweet as he thought of what had been  accomplished.  </P> <P> It was played back for him on Friday as he and his wife, Sandy, were honored by  the Leukemia Society of America during a luncheon at the Garden City Hotel. The  program included a filmed tribute that touched on the highlights of his career  with the Mets, right down to the double in his final at-bat in Shea Stadium in  the last home game of the 1989 season.  </P> <P> "I was fighting back the tears then," Carter recalled. "To see it on film, it  was tough not to let it go. I didn't think I was going to break down." But he  did. Not that anyone seemed to mind. There were a few tears in the audience,  too. A memorable era in Mets' history ended two days after the conclusion of  the season when Keith Hernandez and Carter, Mex and the Kid, were told by  management they would not be invited back.  </P> <P> They were the senior citizens, the co-captains, the acknowledged leaders of the  '86 championship team. The parting was not a shock. After all, both had spent  the major portion of the year on the disabled list and their lucrative,  long-term contracts had expired. Nevertheless, the news hit hard.  </P> <P> "It was so final," Carter recalled. "It was very emotional. I thought back to  all the things that had happened. It was like a marriage, really. I flew home  to Florida on the day after the announcement. It took me a couple of weeks to  get over it."  </P> <P> The man returned to be saluted by the society for which he and his wife have  donated considerable time. He has yet to find gainful employment with another  major-league baseball club, his stated goal, but from his smile it appeared he  had just celebrated a .300 season by signing a five-year contract. It's rarely  been necessary for anyone to tell Gary Carter to keep his chin up.  </P> <P> "I have some leads," he said. "There's nothing definite. I've been working all  winter with a physical therapist and I feel fine. Unless my body tells me I'm  finished, I expect to be back. I think there's a team out there that will be  interested."  </P> <P> Hernandez has signed with the Cleveland Indians, but he doesn't have to squat  on damaged knees. There was a time last season, Carter said, where he couldn't  even bend. But the surgery from which he rushed back late last season has had  time to heal.  </P> <P> Carter did get back into uniform once in Florida and the reaction told him his  skills still are in demand, if only by the people running the Senior  Association. He asked the owner of the West Palm Beach Tropics if he could work  out with the club before a game one night and the man agreed. When he taped an  interview for a local television station in his borrowed Tropics' finery, word  spread around Florida.  </P> <P> He got offers from other clubs seeking his services. Among the callers was Earl  Weaver, who said, "Our owner wants to sign you. And you won't have to play  weekends." It was an offer Carter can and did refuse.  </P> <P> The only affiliation he wants with senior baseball at the moment is the  broadcasting duties he shares with his neighbor, Tommy Hutton. "If I'm healthy  enough," he figured, "I should be able to play major-league baseball."  </P> <P> If the man does make a comeback, it won't be in New York where he began the  second phase of his career with a game-winning home run on Opening Day, 1985,  before a crowd that included Vice President Bush. The VP has moved up and now  Carter has moved on.  </P> <P> He ran down the salaries the Mets are paying to the starting rotation and to a  few other regulars. "And then they have to pay Darryl (Strawberry)," he said.  "Keith and I were the odd guys out."  </P> <P> They also were the old guys who were unable to provide leadership the club was  so sorely lacking last season because they were able to play so little. As  their roles diminished, the attitude of the Mets suffered.  </P> <P> "It's going to be interesting to see who steps forward," Carter said. "Maybe  HoJo. Or Darryl. Kevin (McReynolds) is (too) quiet. And Darryl, if he doesn't  get his new contract, you know how he'll be."  </P> <P> But that's someone else's problem now.  </P></p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Hungary sets sell-off target Hungary's Socialist-led government yesterday approved sweeping changes to privatisation regulations, with the aim of completing the sale of most state companies by the end of its term in 1998. To make administration of privatisation more efficient and less expensive, Mr Laszlo Bekesi, finance minister, said AVU, the state property agency, and AV Rt, the state holding company, would be merged into a single company. Officials said the government would aim for rapid sales rather than restructure companies ahead of privatisation. Sales to cash bidders would be preferred, with revenue generated from the sale of blue chip companies used to pay off state debt. The new strategy envisaged greater use of the country's nascent capital markets, Mr Bekesi said.</p>

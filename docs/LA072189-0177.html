			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. LEADING W. GERMANY 1-0 IN DAVIS CUP SEMIFINAL  </P> <P> Last-minute substitute Brad Gilbert rallied to beat Carl-Uwe Steeb in five sets  today and gave the United States a 1-0 lead over defending champion West  Germany in their Davis Cup semifinal in Munich.  </P> <P> Gilbert, filling in for the injured John McEnroe, downed Steeb 6-2, 2-6, 2-6,  6-4, 6-4 in just under three hours before a subdued capacity crowd of 12,300 at  Olympic Hall.  </P> <P> The victory was crucial for the United States because it means the American  team will gain at least a split on the opening day of the best-of-five-matches  series. With West German ace Boris Becker scheduled to play Andre Agassi in the  second match, the U.S. team needed to win the opener to avoid a possible 0-2  deficit going into Saturday's doubles match.  </P> <P> The winner will play the victor of the Sweden-Yugoslavia semifinal for the  Davis Cup championship in December. The United States has not won the Davis Cup  since 1982 and has not reached the final since 1984.  </P> <P> In Bastad, Sweden, Jonas Svensson and Mats Wilander gave Sweden a commanding  2-0 lead over Yugoslavia in their semifinals after both men won their singles  matches today.  </P> <P> Wilander, ranked fourth in the world, struggled early but then turned it into a  rout as he posted a 7-6, 6-1, 6-0 win over Goran Prpic.  </P> <P> Earlier, Svensson beat teen-ager Goran Ivanisevic 6-4, 7-6, 3-6, 6-4 on the  slow clay.  </P> <P> Sweden, trying to reach the final for the seventh consecutive year, has never  lost a Davis Cup best-of-five-matches series after winning the first two  singles.  </P> <P> Stefan Edberg, who was replaced by Svensson in singles after spraining his  ankle last weekend, and Anders Jarryd are heavily favored to wrap up the  semifinal in Saturday's doubles.  </P> <P> The reverse singles are set for Sunday at this seaside resort in southern  Sweden.  </P></p>

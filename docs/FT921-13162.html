			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Japanese sell dizzy surplus as a short-term spectre - Figures that belie fundamental changes in trade with the US, Europe and Asia THE RETURN of Japan's 1991 trade surplus to the dizzy levels of five years ago gives the impression that the underlying trend remains unchanged in spite of the appreciation of the yen, a flurry of market-opening measures and the surge in foreign direct investment by Japanese companies. But the daunting surplus - at Dollars 78.2bn, not far below the 1986 record of Dollars 82.7bn and a 50 per cent increase on 1990 - reflects fundamental changes in Japan's trading patterns. These include a decrease in the reliance on direct exports to the US market, a fact obscured by the recent heightening of trade tension between the two countries. The trends of last year also highlight the potential for trade friction with the European Community, in coming months, and the likelihood of louder complaints from Asian trading partners, who are experiencing real rises in their bilateral deficits far larger than those on the US deficit with Japan. Last year's figures also reflected China's emergence as a powerful trading economy. Sino-Japanese trade totalled a record Dollars 22.8bn, with exports from Japan rising 40.2 per cent to Dollars 8.6bn, and imports to Japan 18 per cent higher at Dollars 14.2bn, giving China a Dollars 5.6bn bilateral surplus. While Japan's surplus has fallen as a share of total trade volume from 24.6 per cent to 14.2 per cent since 1986, its apparently unchanged value - in current prices - is the most obvious target for foreign criticism and a particularly tempting target for US Congress representatives in an election year. The surplus in trade with the US rose 1.3 per cent last year to Dollars 38.45bn, the first increase in four years. However, as a percentage of bilateral trade volume the surplus has fallen from 46.9 per cent in 1986 to 26.6 per cent last year. One problem is that Japan's imports from the US remain weighted towards commodities, the prices of which have been weak, while machinery of all kinds comprised only 34.2 per cent of the total last year. Washington has sought to narrow the difference by pushing for a stronger yen, but the short-term effect of yen appreciation will be to increase the US dollar value of Japanese exports, widen the surplus and, perhaps, raise trade tension. But in spite of the harsh political environment, Japan's Ministry of Finance continues to suggest that the expansion of the surplus is a 'misunderstanding'. Tokyo argues that 'special factors' are responsible for the 1991 surge and that these factors will be less influential in the coming year. These 'special' conditions, reckoned to account for around 80 per cent of the increase, are: currency fluctuations, the post-Gulf crisis plunge in oil prices, 'unusually' low commodity prices, and the collapse of Japan's financial 'bubble'. But the Bank of Japan admits that these 'special factors' also exaggerated the fall in the surplus from 1987 to 1990, when it bottomed at Dollars 52.1bn. For example, bank officials say luxury good imports were artificially high in the late 1980s, when financial speculation reached a peak. Japanese officials hope that the taste for luxuries will return this year, although imports of art works are likely to remain flat and imported prestige cars now face much tougher competition from Japanese luxury models. Slower demand for luxury goods contributed to the 48 per cent increase to Dollars 27.37bn in the surplus with the EC. Tokyo suggests that another special factor, the rebuilding of the former east Germany, led to an unusual increase, 16 per cent, in exports to Germany. Recession did not undermine European demand for Japanese products, and the stirrings of economic recovery are likely to produce a widening of surpluses. Exports to the UK last year rose 2.2 per cent to Dollars 11bn, while imports from the UK fell 4.1 per cent to Dollars 5bn, also reflecting the weaker demand for luxury goods and imported cars. Japan's exports to Italy rose 11.2 per cent to Dollars 3.8bn, while its imports from Italy declined 9.5 per cent to Dollars 4.5bn. The sharp rises in Japan's exports to south-east Asia follow on from the establishment of manufacturing bases in these countries and the shipping of value-added components to these facilities. Exports to Malaysia rose 38.6 per cent last year, those to Singapore increased 14.1 per cent and to Indonesia by 11.4 per cent. Further to the north, exports to Taiwan rose 18.3 per cent and to South Korea by 15 per cent. Dr Kenneth Courtis, senior economist at Deutsche Bank Capital Markets, said that a large share of Japan's component exports to Asia are for use in products ultimately destined for the US market. He said Asia will again be an important source of export growth this year and that heavy investment at home by Japanese companies has put them in a superior position to take advantage of an upturn in the global economy. Foreign financial houses in Tokyo and Japanese institutions generally predict that the overall surplus will surge in the first quarter, but rise slightly over the whole of this year. They are agreed that the surplus is likely to surpass the 1986 record, and that it will definitely be a source of some political embarrassment for Japan's government. Tokyo trade officials yesterday said they plan to monitor Japanese carmakers' efforts to buy more US vehicles and parts and will report progress to Washington, Reuter writes from Tokyo. Some three quarters of Japan's trade surplus with the US is a product of the sales of Japanese cars and car parts in America.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Andreyev: "`Kravchuk Remains Silent About </F> Us...'"]    [Text]  <H5>  The Situation </H5>   Features in the portrait of Pasha--the new migrant  worker and strikebreaker    "I sold myself for rubles"--my casual fellow-traveler  uttered this phrase on the train with cheerful defiance and  slyness. The word "myself" here has significance--for Pasha, a  young miner from Sverdlovsk in Lugansk Oblast, did not bring  Ukrainian sausage to Russia, but his own hands... Foreign  workers and migrant workers, just like the problems associated  with them, have existed for a long time and continue to exist.  For us, both more or less free movement and the "fresh" state  borders are a new phenomenon. I was interested in this firsthand  information. After all, it is not a question of a single  incident but of a system.    Miners from Ukrainian border towns are applying as whole  crews to work in Russia's mines. No, there are no recruiters  coming here (in any case, not widely), and they are not spending  time on persuasion. The ruble is sufficient agitation; that is,  its real purchasing power in Russia and the appreciable  difference in the rate of exchange, which in Ukraine makes it  possible for owners of rubles to feel more like a white person.  And in the meantime our economy will remain a pathetic  cripple--we will serve on a level with third world countries as  a source of cheap manpower.    Why cheap? No, it has not yet reached the point of paying  Ukrainian miners lower rates. The advantage is in something  else. The more Ukrainian crews there are in Russian mines, the  more stability there is, according to the employers. Since the  ruble is worth more for us, less rubles are required: Ukrainian  crews do not intend to strike, and do not demand wage increases,  in contrast to their Russian colleagues. The presence of  strike-breakers (it is called precisely that), naturally,  assuages the appetites of the locals. But the strike-breakers,  as is known, are not liked... Pasha agrees with this claim.  There have been no disputes yet at the mine where he worked. But  neighboring Ukrainians are beginning to be persecuted a little;  for example, time after time their clothes are cut up when they  leave them in the changing room.    From the standpoint of civilized state concepts, Pasha and  his comrades live a strange life at the coal face. Twice a day,  before the start and at the end of a shift, they cross the state  border. And, therefore, is it possible, strictly speaking, to  apply the term "migrant worker" to them? A migrant worker, after  all, is a temporary or a permanent emigrant. That is, by  transporting his manpower across the border, he is also  transporting the problems associated with the establishment of  an infrastructure that is necessary for his residency, medical  treatment, cultural relaxation, and education and preschool  instruction for his children. In our case, Ukraine is being  transformed into a weekend bedroom area. But the taxes, which  are obliged to go to maintain and develop the infrastructure,  remain in Russia.    It is a strange life. Not only with regard to these global  and state problems, which Pasha came to generate without  realizing it. This is his daily life. After all, a person, no  matter what level of social consciousness he finds himself, is a  political subject of his own country. Pasha has no country. In  no case professing deliberate anti-Ukrainian attitudes, when  talking about prices or the possibility of buying one or another  commodity he absolutely sincerely says about Russia "in our  country," and about Ukraine--"in your country." After all, when  you calculate it, he spends a large part of his time abroad.  Pasha could not answer when the next elections will be held in  Ukraine. In addition, as you know, he has not been deprived of  his right to vote. Some homebred migrant workers skip voting,  thereby helping "the party in power" to wreck the elections. But  some... (For whom will those of them who come to the ballot box  nevertheless vote?)    It also should not be claimed that, in the person of Pasha's  colleagues, Russia has acquired conscientious supporters with  some kind of political course of their own. Except... "Everyone  in our mine is for Zhirinovskiy," Pasha told me, without  explaining very distinctly precisely why. He considers Yeltsin  to be a Mason. Pasha does not know just what a "Mason" is, and  he does not use this term beratingly, but simply thinks it is a  sign of some kind of force. He has an even more original opinion  about all the rest of the Russian authorities. Blushing in a  youthful way, Pasha put it this way: "You understand, they all  love men more."    He reports all these "secrets" with good-natured  indifference. Neither Yeltsin nor any other Russian powers that  be prevent Pasha from earning the rubles that are so necessary.  He heard that starting this year the Russian Government is  imposing some kind of additional tax on mines that employ  foreign manpower. (This is quite logical; after all, emigrants  take jobs from Russian citizens.) Pasha feels the same  indifference toward the president of his own country--he does  not want to either support or reelect him. He also does not  associate his daily problems with him and with possible changes  in Ukrainian policy: "Kravchuk generally remains silent about  us."    The buses sent by Russian mines go through two customs  points  each shift (a deduction is made from the Ukrainian miners' wages  for this service, but the work is profitable, nonetheless).  Customs officials are convinced that they are not dealing with  profiteers or shifty traders: "What do we take with us--a  miner's lunch box and a washcloth and soap?" Well, and just like  real proletariat, the main wealth that they take away from our  country is their manpower. I do not blame their owners for quite  understandable reasons. On top of all of this, Pasha is earning  his rubles the hard way. It does not have to be explained to  anyone who knows the labor of an "underground hostage"--the  miner. Anyone who has not tried it personally has read  government condolences to the families of those who perished at  a mine face, and is familiar with statistics on illnesses. The  working conditions and level of safety of our native Pasha,  alas, have nothing good to distinguish them either in Ukraine or  Russia.    The buses roll along. Such is the reality today, and if  anyone reading this thinks that the whole point is the absence  of barbed wire on the border, he is mistaken. For seven decades  attempts were made to cure us of the desire to live like human  beings with barbed wire and a short leash. If our money becomes  money, if our mines will become less like graves than the  Russian ones, and if in the end another dozen urgent "if's" are  realized that are possible only given radical reformation of the  economy (and this means that people come to power who are  capable of this), Pasha will gladly forego the long trip with  all its attendant consequences: material, civic, and patriotic.    There is also something to think about in light of today's  situation. How to regulate the piratical "semi-export" of our  manpower? How to arrive at a point where the Russian side does  not just skim off the cream but also frees something for the  miserable budget of the miners' settlements where the workers  live and pay taxes to it? In addition, how to function so that  Pasha knows that his native state is "concerned" about him? I  have no answers to these questions--the statesmen should have  the professional answers. If, of course, not all of them feel  like absolute favorites in a country under whose flag they like  to show off at official receptions.</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Unlikely choice aims to co-ordinate help AS energy secretary during the bitter 1984-85 strike in which the government avenged the earlier defeat of the Heath administration by the miners, Lord Walker might not seem an obvious choice as the national figure intended to co-ordinate measures to help the coalfield communities. His appointment rests not on that experience, but on his record as Welsh secretary from 1987 until 1990, when he turned what he had been expected to regard as a dead-end job into a high-profile, one-man inward investment agency. Though the announcement by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, was greeted with sustained laughter from opposition MPs, Lord Walker's long career in business and in politics - he was a millionaire by the time he was 30 and served as an MP for more than 30 years - is a sign of his acumen and ability as an operator. His business activities also mean that he will not be troubled by the confusion over whether his new post is paid. At the start of the year Lord Walker's business interests listed in the Commons register included non-executive directorships at Smith New Court, the investment house, and British Gas, the privatised utility. He was brought into Smith New Court by Sir Michael Richardson, the chairman who is also vice-chairman of NM Rothschild, the government's main adviser on privatisation of British Coal. His reaction yesterday was to emphasise his aim of creating co-operation between all agencies involved in helping mining communities. 'I want to try to do an analysis of the priorities and what tasks are needed to get new commercial and economic activities in the localities,' he said. 'I think there is a need to try to get a good team spirit going between local authorities, government, industry and trade unions.' Even before Lord Walker stood down from his Worcester constituency at the April general election, Mr Heseltine had called on his skills when, as environment secretary, he announced that Lord Walker would lead the planned urban regeneration agency. Wrangles about the remit and the amount of money for the agency (both the scope of the job and the amount of funds available are diminishing) have since soured Lord Walker's relationship with the Department of the Environment, but he remains close to Mr Heseltine, who was once one of his junior ministers. The two share a longstanding belief that governments should work in partnership with industry - a philosophy that Lord Walker was pursuing as trade and industry secretary 20 years ago - and served together in the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher's cabinet for more than five years.</p>

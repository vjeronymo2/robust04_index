			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFI L.A. INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL: CAPSULE REVIEWS  </P> <P> Following are capsule reviews of today's screenings in the American Film  Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex Odeon Century  Plaza Cinemas:  </P> <P> 'War Requiem'  </P> <P> Great Britain, 1988, 85 minutes  </P> <P> 9 p.m.  </P> <P>  In this complex, beautiful, harrowing and utterly demanding film, Derek Jarman  has created a stylized, often surreal visual accompaniment to the Benjamin  Britten oratorio, which was inspired by the work of World War I poet Wilfred  Owen. Told from the perspective of an elderly veteran (Laurence Olivier, in a  poignant, silent cameo), the film re-creates the Great War through archival  clips, vignettes and religious tableaux in an attempt to give meaning to all  those who sacrificed so much for king and country. Jarman, however, moves well  beyond nostalgic patriotism to make a stunningly effective anti-war protest as  the horrors of World War I give way to images of the conflicts that have risen  since "the war to end all wars." RECOMMENDED. -- KEVIN THOMAS  </P></p>

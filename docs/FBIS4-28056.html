			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [First of two-part series by Nanthiya Tangwisuthichit] </F>   [Text] The Mekong Delta, known as the "rice bowl" of  Vietnam, may no longer be able to lay claim to that title if  proposed hydropower plans affect the fertility of the region.    "Damming the Mekong River is like declaring a war with  Vietnam," noted U.S. biologist Dr Tyson Roberts, who has  observed the Mekong ecological system since the 1970s.    If Roberts is correct, then the first battle has already  begun. Recently completed is the l,500-megawatt Manwan Dam, the  first of its kind on the mainstream Lanchang Giang (Mekong  River) in China's southem province of Yunnan.    The 4,200 kilometre Mekong River starts its journey from the  Tibetan Himalayas passing through southwestern China, Burma,  Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and then to Vietnam, where silt carried  down the river and deposited in the area for thousands of years  has formed a large expanse of over four million hectares of land  at the delta.    River dwellers living in Thailand, Laos and Cambodia have  noticed the unusually low water levels during the dry season  since the dam was built. Vietnam, as the last country the  Mekong passes before entering the sea, is no exception.    "We don't have any concrete or clear scientific conclusions  about the unnatural reduction of water in the Mekong. But  farmers at the delta have already noticed that water levels in  the river and connecting canals are lower than they were in  former years," said Dr Le Quang Minh, dean of the Water Resource  and Land Improvement Faculty, Cantho University.    Cantho is the capital of Hau Giang Province, named after the  largest "tail" of the "dragon". In Vietnam the Mekong River is  known as the Nine-tailed Dragon, as the river formerly split  into nine branches at the delta.    Two of the major branches are the Tien Giang and Hau Giang  where webs of thousands of canals have been dug for navigation  and irrigation. Giang comes from a Chinese letter meaning  river. Today the "dragon" has only seven tails as two of them,  Ba Ly and Co Chien, have been filled up with silt deposits.    Crop cultivation and sustainable ways of life in this part  of  the country are made possible by these tails. Over 50 per cent  of rice harvested for local consumption and export are grown in  the delta region. Shortly after economic liberalization in  1986, Vietnam became the world's third largest rice exporter  after the United States and Thailand.    "Engineers have quite a positive perspective about dams, but  I do not. Even though people desire the proposed function of  the dam, I wonder whether it will be operated as it was  designed. The people who designed it are not the same ones as  those who operate it," said Minh.    There are fears that the dam will be operated solely for the  purpose of supplying energy without thought given to the effect  dam operations will have on the delta region.    "If I were the director, and those dams were designed for  generating electricity, I would keep this function as my  priority when operating the dam. In the dry season, I would  retain water to secure operation of the dam."    "It's the same story with the flood," the water management  specialist continued. "If there is a big flood, I don't believe  dam operators would retain the water because it could be risky  for the safety of the dam."    Due to Vietnam's push for development and wealth, supported  by multilateral business and financial agencies, the Vietnamese  government strictly maintains its export-oriented policy.  Agricultural products, especially rice, are produced for export.  High-yield-varieties have been promoted in the delta area.  Irrigation systems, as a result, need to be expanded and  improved upon to catch up to the expansion of plantation areas.    The An Giang and Kien Giang provinces, west of the delta, as  well as Dong Thap province in the East, are in the target areas  of such agricultural development. However, the soil in O.55  million hectares of the area is strongly acidic, 1.05 million  hectares is medium and lightly acidic, 0.15 million hectares is  permanently saline and 0.16 million has high salinity in the dry  season.    The relationship between the soil, water and farming systems  in the Mekong delta is so complicated and fragile that any  changes in the condition of one component needs to be repeatedly  tried and tested before the actual results of the change can be  determined.    The Mekong Committee in 1992 hired the Netherlands  Development Consultancy to plan irrigation improvement of the  acidic areas in the Southwest of the delta. The consultant at  that time planned to divert the water from the Hau Giang River  to lower the acidity levels.    But the plan has not been implemented as detailed studies  are  needed to find out how much water should be wed. Too much water  for irrigation means not enuough water at the mouth of the Hua  Giang to maintain the natural conditions of salinity from the  South China Sea.    While hydro engineers dream to tame the Mekong by  controlling  natural floods and drought, what never seems to be taken into  account is the ecological implications when the natural flow is  disrupted by huge concrete structures such as dams.</p>

Brig. Joseph Henry Smith, commander of security  operations in northern Ghana told a press conference in Tamale,  about 405 miles north of Accra, that security agencies were  searching for more bodies. He said the military was gradually  taking control of the situation and has started disarming the  warring factions.    Brig. Smith said more than 2,000 shot guns have been seized.  He said the number of deaths cannot be estimated because many  people who have been killed in the bush or have died in their  rooms when their villages were burned were yet to be found.  Brig. Smith said a national emergency committee under the  chairmanship of the minister of defence, Mahama Iddrisu, has  been established to bring the ethnic fighting in the region  under control.

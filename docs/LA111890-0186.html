			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'VILLAGE' COVER-UP IS HISTORY LESSON  </P> <P> I read with incredulity of the $16-million Long Beach proposal to disguise oil  derricks as redwood pillars, conceal shabby properties with wave-decorated  walls, attempt to cover street noises with the "music" of a giant whale chime,  and refer to a city of 500,000 as a "village" (Times, Nov. 4). The thought that  kept running through my head was "Potemkin Village."  </P> <P> Over 200 years ago, a powerful Russian leader, charged by Empress Catherine II  with the task of colonizing the Ukrainian Steppes, undertook vast and expensive  developments. As so often happens today, the cost far exceeded projections,  forcing Grigori Potemkin to abandon his ambitious projects halfway to  completion. Then came word that the Empress would be touring the area to view  the wonders he had wrought. 'Twas said that he "disguised the weaknesses" in  his program, giving rise to tales that he had erected artificial villages -- in  truth, mere facades -- to impress the Empress as she swept through the region.  </P> <P> Today, the definition of a Potemkin Village is: "any pretentious facade  designed to cover up shabby or undesirable conditions." History does, indeed,  repeat itself.  </P> <P> JO BENNITT  </P> <P> Cypress  </P></p>

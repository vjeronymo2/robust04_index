			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 27 Mar (INA) -- His Excellency leader  President Saddam Husayn has chaired a joint session of the  Revolution Command Council [RCC] and the Iraq Command of the  Arab Socialist Ba'th Party [ASBP].    The meeting reviewed the visit to New York by an Iraqi  delegation led by Tariq 'Aziz, deputy prime minister and member  of the RCC and the Iraqi Command of the ASBP, and the outcome of  his contacts with the members of the UN Security Council.    After the meeting, an official spokesman made the following  statement:    Our delegation noticed that there are circles in the  Security  Council that may grow into a majority that have begun to sense  the harshness of the blockade to which the Iraqi people are  being subjected. These circles are taking a positive outlook on  Iraq's implementation of the obligations enshrined in Resolution  687. The nations that represent this trend stressed the need  for Rolf Ekeus to present a monthly report to the council about  the Special Commission's relations with Iraq and for this to  lead to the commission setting the beginning and period of what  was called the test in order for the Security Council to move to  the implementation of Paragraph 22, which should not take long.    Some council members mentioned six months as a suitable  period to test the implementation mechanism. Other member  nations wondered why the period could not be a little shorter or  longer to make sure that Ekeus draws up his timetable on clear  and practical grounds rather than be swayed by political goals  that do not meet with the agreement of the council's members who  moved from a new positive position in their approach to this  issue.    This constructive and fair position was shared by France,  Russia, and the PRC, along with other nations like Brazil,  Pakistan, Nigeria, and Rwanda, among others. On the other hand,  the United States and its supporters, or the countries that are  influenced by its analyses and intentions, view things from the  perspective of fabricating excuses to drag out the blockade on  our people and avoid a commitment to a fixed date for  implementing Paragraph 22, which allows Iraq to export its  products, including oil, to the outside world    The conclusion we have drawn is that an important positive  development has occurred in the position of important and  influential circles in the Security Council. This development  requires follow-up and encouragement in order to know for  certain whether or not there is should be serious and imminent  hope for the lifting of the injustice done to Iraq. The next  two months will be important to make clear conclusions in light  of what President Saddam Husayn announced in his address to the  council of ministers on Sunday, 13 March 1994, the first day of  the blessed 'Id al-Fitr. After two months, the ASBP command and  the RCC will be able to make the suitable decisions.    The official spokesman said: On this occasion, we pay  special tribute to the states whose positions were clear in this  direction. These specifically included France, Russia, China,  and Brazil. We appeal to these countries to develop their  positions to become clearer and more influential within the  Security Council and the circles in which they have influence.  While following up all the details of these developments, our  great people will not forget the fair stands of these states and  whoever support this just position. It is obvious that the basis  for the development in the stands of these countries vis-a-vis  Iraq is the firmness and patience of our great people; their  active social, political, and economic life; our people's strong  adherence to their future; and their firm and unshakeable faith  in their nationalism.    The ASBP command and the RCC adopted a series of  instructions  and resolutions to follow up the political and diplomatic move  in the coming period and until the next Security Council review  [of the sanctions on Iraq] in the second half of May.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lagos, Feb 6 (AFP) -- Illegal immigrants from  neighbouring states have flocked into northeastern Nigeria since  the devaluation of the CFA franc on January 11, the NEWS AGENCY  OF NIGERIA (NAN) reported Sunday [6 February]. The agency said  the immigrants have invaded Yola, capital of Adamawa state  following the devaluation, which was accompanied by the pegging  of the Nigerian currency at 22 naira to the dollar.    The Nigerian government decision to peg the currency against  the dollar, announced at the same time as the 1994 budget,  enhanced the value of the naira against the CFA franc, said NAN.  Before the government decision, 1,000 CFA francs could buy 140  naira on the black market. Now they could only buy 65 naira.    NAN said the immigrants were mostly from neighbouring  Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Mali, and mainly old men with wives  and children. It gave no figure for how many people were  involved.    The head of immigration in the state, Aliyu Abdullahi, told  NAN that some of the aliens were also from Algeria and  war-afflicted Sudan.    NAN said the male immigrants had sought employment in  low-paid work such as the construction industry, or as gatemen,  nightwatchmen. Women are trying to work as hairdressers.</p>

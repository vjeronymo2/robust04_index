			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Caracas plan aims to pull inforeign funds The Venezuelan government moved closer at the weekend to implementing a new programme designed to stabilise the economy and pull the nation out of its second year of recession. President Rafael Caldera and his cabinet approved the programme at a special cabinet session on Saturday. However, officials said that details would not be made public until after a series of meetings to be held with representatives of political parties, business, organised labour, the Catholic Church and other groups. The Caldera administration's main goals are to fight inflation by reducing the fiscal deficit. A plank of the policy is to attract new foreign investment especially in petroleum and heavy industry, and to revive the 'strategic role' of the government in the economy. The government aims to increase workers' real purchasing power, and provide social welfare benefits to the nation's poor. The programme is expected to include the following elements: Fiscal action, such as increasing some direct and indirect taxes, improving revenue collection at all levels, and reducing allowable deductions for income taxes. Staggered increases in retail prices of petrol, which now sells at about the equivalent of 13 US cents (8p) per US gallon. These price increases will be accompanied by some type of wage bonus or subsidy to private sector and government workers. Replacing zero-coupon bonds, denominated in Venezuelan currency and issued by the central bank, with US dollar-denominated or dollar-linked instruments backed by Venezuelan oil. The new instruments, to be purchased only with Venezuelan currency, will be used to absorb excess liquidity and should cost the government considerably less than the zero-coupon bonds. Government financial assistance for small businesses, agriculture and tourism. The re-organisation of several ministries. It was not clear whether the government was planning to include one key reform, involving changes in the current system of accumulated severance benefits, in its programme. For years, business in Venezuela has been seeking changes in the system, which creates heavy liabilities for employers. Also, it was not apparent whether the government planned to make any changes in existing controls on prices and foreign exchange transactions, or whether it would restore six constitutional rights suspended on June 27. Under the economic plan, the government hopes to lower inflation from a projected 60 per cent this year to 25 to 30 per cent in 1995. Inflation last year was 46 per cent. For 1995, the administration also hopes to achieve a zero fiscal deficit and to raise non-oil gross domestic product to a positive 3.9 per cent, compared to a projected negative 4.3 per cent this year. President Caldera, who began a five-year term in February, inherited a weak economy and a financial crisis that forced his government to take over 11 commercial banks and provide financial aid to several others. The president has repeatedly said that he rejects the free-market economic policies applied during the previous administration. He has turned to heavy government intervention to tackle Venezuela's economic and financial problems. Despite this position, he is opening the country's oil exploration and production sectors to major international investment, for the first time since the petroleum industry was nationalised in 1976.</p>

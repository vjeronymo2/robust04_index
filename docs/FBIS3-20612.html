			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] In 1993, China's newly installed hydroelectric  capacity set a record (for any single year), breaking the 3  million kilowatt barrier.    Up to 25 December 1993, 12 generators larger than 200MW (and  with a total installed capacity of 3.0225 million kilowatts) had  gone into service. This exceeded the State Plan, which called  for 11 units with a combined capacity of 2.77 million kilowatts.  Added to this are local small and medium hydroelectric  generators, which put China in second place in the world (behind  Brazil) for newly installed hydro capacity, exceeding that of  the United States, the former Soviet Union, and Canada.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, March 11 KYODO -- Ichiro Ozawa, a  close associate of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and a  possible trouble-shooter in the troubled U.S.-Japan ties, will  visit the United States later this month, diplomatic sources  said Friday [11 March].    The sources said Ozawa is tentatively set to arrive in  Washington on March 21.    Ozawa has a reputation for political savvy and has won  admirers on Capitol Hill. He indicated his intention to visit  Washington following the breakdown of trade talks last month  that soured Japan's economic relationship with its U.S. ally.    Japanese diplomatic sources said the itinerary of Ozawa's  trip has yet to be finalized.    Ozawa will probably stay in the U.S. for one week from March  21, meeting congressional leaders and officials in the Clinton  administration. A meeting with President Bill Clinton is also a  possibility, the sources said.    One certainty in Ozawa's trip is a speech to be delivered at  the National Press Club in Washington on March 23, the sources  said.    Ozawa is secretary general of Shinseito (Japan Renewal  Party), one of the seven parties that form the Hosokawa  coalition government but he occupies no formal government  position.    There has been speculation in Tokyo that Ozawa may come to  Washington as Hosokawa's special envoy but Japanese diplomatic  sources say they are unaware of any such decision.    The Japanese Government plans to unveil a package of market-  opening measures by the end of this month and U.S. officials  have said Washington is keeping a close watch on its contents.    Trade talks between the U.S. and Japan broke down on  February  11 after the Japanese Government rejected U.S. demands to set  numerical indicators to measure progress in Japanese imports.    Ozawa raised expectations in Washington of a possible change  of heart in Tokyo with a suggestion that Japan may accept  voluntary targets he characterized as "endeavor indicators" so  long as the U.S. does not take them as binding commitments.    House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt has expressed  interest  in the proposal, telling reporters Thursday he is "absolutely"  comfortable with Ozawa's idea.    Gephardt, who is expected to meet Ozawa, also paid him a  glowing tribute, saying he has found no political leader in  Japan "more forthcoming" than Ozawa.    Ozawa, who wrote a best-seller calling for a restructuring  of  the Japanese political and economic system, also has an admirer  in U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who is fond of  quoting a passage in Ozawa's book encouraging the Japanese to  behave like a "normal country."</p>

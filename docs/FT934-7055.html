			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Monks slams Major Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, yesterday accused the government of ignoring the value of jobs in its call for a return to basic values. He said: 'Mr Major talks a lot about returning to basic values and appears to look back to the 1950s as a model. But he neglects the most important factor in those times - namely that unemployment was at rock bottom and that school leavers . . . had a realistic prospect of a job,' he told the Apex section of the GMB union.</p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Football pools adapt to meet lottery challenge FOOTBALL POOLS operators are adapting their game for the first time for more than 20 years to try to be more competitive with the planned National Lottery, with its top prize of Pounds 1m a week. The three main pools operators - Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters - said yesterday they were changing their scoring system to increase the chances of more big jack-pots. The new points system will separate matches that are drawn 1-1 from other score draws. From February 27, each 1-1 draw will get 3 points, other score draws only 2 1/2 points and no-score draws only 2 points. Both home and away wins will receive 1 1/2 points and the old 1-point level will disappear. Eight of the new 1-1 draws would produce the winning 24 points. 'The changes we have announced today demonstrate the determination of the pools industry to provide a strong competitive response to the challenge posed by the imminent introduction of the National Lottery,' said Mr Malcolm Hughes, managing director of Vernons Pools. Statistical analysis of results suggests that the new scor-ing system will restore frequent big wins and pro-duce at least one jackpot a month. The change does not mean that the pools will be paying out more money overall, unless the large jackpots attract more players. In recent years there has been an increase in the number of score draws leading to fewer jackpots and a larger number of smaller dividends. An additional dividend level is also being introduced as part of yesterday's changes, to provide a wide range of smaller prizes. There are about 12m regular pools players every week and the industry, with 6,500 employees and 70,000 local collectors, had turnover of Pounds 800m in 1991. The pools operators are continuing to lobby for 'a level playing field' in the battle with the National Lottery. Operators claim that unless that happens, two of the big three would go out of business with the loss of thousands of jobs. The pools industry wants to be able to collect coupons from retail outlets, advertise on radio and television, have comparable treatment in the way turnover is treated for tax and donations and roll up prize funds from one week to the next. At the moment, pools prize funds have to be made up from the income received during the same week. The National Lottery Bill is due to have its second reading in the House of Commons later this month.</p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Former minister hits at red tape bill A former Tory defence minister yesterday added his voice to criticism of the government's plans to give itself greater powers to repeal legislation. The de-regulation bill - which was passed with a government majority of 37 at second reading on Tuesday - would allow ministers to repeal primary legislation by statutory order. Speaking in the Commons, Sir Michael Neubert, MP for Romford, delivered a strong warning about the possible consequences of allowing ministers to take too much power in their drive to cut red tape. Sir Michael asked MPs: 'Isn't it less than satisfactory that the only safeguard against ministerial misjudgment in the exercise of delegated powers of de-regulation is the consideration of 90 minutes for statutory instruments which are unamendable by this House?' Replying for the government, Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said that the public would benefit from the removal of 'antique, medieval restrictions which have no place in the modern age'. A number of Tories said they were likely to vote against the government when the bill reached committee stage.</p>

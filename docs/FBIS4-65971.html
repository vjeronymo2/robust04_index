			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ugur Sefkat: "Alliance Between the PKK and </F> Armenians"]    [Text] Ankara--Concrete documentation has been compiled on  the "cooperation between the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK]  and the Armenians." The Turkish Government has known of the  cooperation between the PKK and the Armenians for many years,  but the issue was consistently denied by circles supporting that  organization.    It has been established that PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan  received funds and arms from Armenia through Armenian priests in  Lebanon. Ocalan's links with the Armenian priests have been  documented with photographs. The intelligence units have tried  to document the cooperation between the PKK and the Armenians  for years. They had an opportunity to do so in Bar Ilyas in  al-Biqa' Valley on Tuesday, 3 May. The intelligence units  established that the priests of the Gregorian Church in Lebanon  frequently call on Ocalan, who occasionally travels from Syria  to the small town in al-Biqa' Valley. They took action and  documented the most recent meeting he had with the Armenian  priests by taking their photographs. Ocalan, considering that he  is no longer comfortable in Syria or Lebanon, conferred with his  guests on the possibility of moving to Armenia. The extremist  Dachnak Party in Armenia has occasionally provided the PKK with  funds and arms through the Armenian priests in Lebanon.    Most Armenians are affiliated with the Gregorian Church,  which has close links with the Orthodox faith. Its patriarch  lives in Echmiadzin, which is near Yerevan. The Armenians in  Lebanon have very strong links with Echmiadzin. The church in  Echmiadzin has significant influence with the Armenian  Government.    Armenians reportedly make up a third of the PKK's  4,000-member mountain cadre and the Armenians in Syria play an  effective role in the organization. The commanders of the PKK's  mountain cadres are Armenian. Officials have said that this has  been confirmed by the many uncircumcised militants the security  forces have discovered among the PKK members killed or captured  in operations.  <H5>  Orders To Kill Sakik </H5>   The recent blows the security forces have dealt the PKK have  created confusion among the leading members of the organization.  PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan has instructed his militants to kill  Muslum Durgun, alias Dr. Baran, and Semdin Sakik, alias  Parmaksiz Zeki. Both were among the most important members of  the PKK. Sakik was the provincial commander of what the PKK  calls Amed Province. He has been living in a camp in Danbak,  north of Maku in Iran, since 5 April. Ocalan ordered his  militants to kill Sakik because he criticized his decisions.  Regarding Sakik's case, Ocalan reportedly instructed Cemil  Bayik, commander of the PKK Kurdish People's Liberation Army, as  follows: "Sakik has adopted a defeatist approach. He will pay  for it with his head. Put him before a firing squad."    It was Sakik who ordered a group of PKK militants to kill 33  unarmed soldiers in Bingol Province in 1993. But his remarks to  a group of leading PKK members in the camp in Danbak on 8 May  prompted Ocalan to order his militants to kill him. Sakik  reportedly said: "Insensitive parasites who have a lust for  luxury are as dangerous as the enemy. The cause cannot be  maintained with leaders who fail to establish the enemy's  tactics in the war and who are unable to give accurate and  effective instructions. A wounded man cannot see the outcome of  an action. It is a virtue to decide to withdraw."</p>

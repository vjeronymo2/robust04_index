			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Norwegian ministry accused Norway's finance ministry tried to tamper with an investigation into alleged tax violations by central bank governor Mr Torstein Moland, a key official said yesterday. Mr Jan Gotaas, head of the Oslo Tax Board overseeing the investigation, said a finance ministry official had attempted to change the way Mr Moland and others were being examined for allegedly breaking tax laws. 'I know this from good and reliable sources,' Mr Gotaas, also a justice ministry official and a member of prime minister Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland's Labour party, told Reuters. Mrs Brundtland's government survived a no-confidence vote last May after the opposition attacked its choice of Mr Moland. Tax directorate official Ms Ingrid Tveit yesterday dismissed Mr Gotaas' remarks, saying he had misunderstood a report. The Oslo Tax Directorate is probing the role of Mr Moland and 148 others in K/S Airbus A320, a limited partnership founded in 1990 for financing aircraft purchases. At issue in Mr Moland's case is whether he knew that a stake he held in the partnership was subject to a repurchase agreement at the time he bought it and thus did not qualify for tax breaks. Mr Moland, who has denied wrongdoing, invested NKr75,000 (Pounds 7,000) in the project, claimed tax breaks and sold in 1991.</p>

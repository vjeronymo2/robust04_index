			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Builders face pressure after glass price rise Pilkington, the glass group, is attempting to raise its European prices in a move that could increase pressure on struggling UK construction companies already operating on wafer-thin margins. The group has put up its basic UK glass price by 6 per cent, while its prices in continental Europe have increased by an average of 9 per cent. Pilkington shares rose 5p to 201p on the news. The company wants to recoup some of the price falls of recent years. Its decision is in line with other building-material producers which have increased prices in the past 12 months. Mr Andrew Robb, finance director, said glass prices had fallen by 30 per cent during the past three years. He added: 'We are only trying to recover lost ground.' Although the group has cut costs, the price falls have hit its profits hard. It is the second time in 12 months that the company has tried to raise prices. In February last year it increased prices by 8 per cent only to see the increment eroded as the year progressed. Other UK building-material producers have been more successful in making price rises stick. Producers of structural steel, plasterboard, concrete, cement and some types of bricks have managed to increase prices as manufacturing capacity in these industries has reduced or been rationalised during the recession. Construction companies that have won building contracts at little or no profit margin could find themselves in serious trouble if the cost of carrying out the work increases because of material price rises. In the case of glass, continuing surplus capacity and falling demand in continental Europe has made it more difficult to push through increases. In Germany, in spite of good demand for building glass, prices have fallen by 10 per cent during the past year. Automotive glass volumes have been weak. Mr Robb said capacity utilisation of about 85 per cent in Europe was still too low to ensure price stability. He said it was too early to say whether the price increase would hold. However, the acquisition last year of the glass distribution business of Heywood Williams, which gave Pilkington a 55 per cent share of the UK market, should help in making the price rise stick, he said. Earlier this month Pilkington's US subsidiary Libbey-Owens-Ford raised its flat glass prices, for the third time in a year, by 5 per cent.</p>

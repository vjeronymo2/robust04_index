			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Letter: Cost pressures that will change the shape of the oil industry Sir, I read with interest the Lex column regarding the oil industry (May 11) where the real problem was diagnosed as 'not so much cheap oil as the financial legacy of the late 1980s'. This tells part, but by no means all, of the story. Companies are facing a declining net margin not just because of the restored downward trend in real oil values - which looks set to continue in the 1990s  -but because of rising real costs. These are an equally important part of the profit equation, yet strangely ignored. The industry is facing cost pressures on all sides; upstream, as exploration activity increasingly focuses on frontier, or relatively unexplored, areas; downstream, as product specification standards are tightened to deal with environmental issues. In the US alone, it is estimated that the cost of clean air legislation will amount to some Dollars 40bn between now and 2000. The leading companies will meanwhile continue paying the price of a largely unsuccessful and expensive diversification programme away from oil and gas in the 1980s through an ongoing process of restructuring. For the independents spawned during the boom years, horizontal integration may be the next big step forward in the process of their evolution. The industry's power base, having variously shifted between the owners and developers of the assets over the past 30 years, now seems to be moving towards the consumers. The industry as a whole will survive the trend, though perhaps not in its current form. Christine Baker, Nomura Research Institute, 1 St Martin's-le-Grand, London EC1A 4NP</p>

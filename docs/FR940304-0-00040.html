			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Correlating the narrative diagnosis and the CPT&hyph;4 procedure code is a requirement of the Medicare carrier, and has been a standard requirement for years. It has only been modified by the new physician diagnostic coding requirements. Physicians must now correlate the ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM code, instead of the narrative, to the CPT&hyph;4 code.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that suppliers cannot be required to include diagnostic coding on Part B bills even though they often provide the diagnostic codes identified by the physician on bills for equipment and supplies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We have never required suppliers to include diagnostic coding on their Part B bills. Section 1842(p)(1) of the Act requires physicians, as defined in section 1861(r) of the Act, and subject to limitations concerning the scope of practice by each State and other provisions of title XVIII of the Act, to furnish diagnostic coding. That is, only doctors of medicine or osteopathy, dental surgery or dental medicine, podiatry, optometry, or chiropractic must furnish diagnostic coding. Durable medical equipment suppliers are not included in this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter inquired why his or her carrier included messages in the explanation of the Medicare benefit worksheet regarding both diagnostic coding requirements (ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM) and procedural coding requirements (CPT&hyph;4) since the proposed rule (54 FR 30559, July 21, 1989) stated that there is no current requirement for diagnostic coding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The statement on page 54 FR 30559 referred to the policy before implementation of section 1842(p)(1) of the Act that requires physician diagnostic coding instead of the written narrative that was previously required. We are now conforming the regulations to the previously issued administrative instructions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CPT&hyph;4 coding (part of the HCFA Common Procedural Coding System) describes physician services and supplies, not diagnoses. If either fields 23 or 24c on the form HCFA&hyph;1500 are blank, the carrier will communicate with the physician via the explanation of the Medicare benefit worksheet requesting completion of this information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A commenter asserted that as an incentive all bills or requests for payment without ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM codes should be rejected and that properly coded bills and requests for payment should be expedited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Act specifically provides for denial of payment for a bill submitted by a physician on an assignment-related basis if it does not include the appropriate diagnostic code. For a claim for an item or service not submitted on an assignment-related basis, the Act authorizes the Secretary to impose a civil money penalty, not to exceed $2,000, against a physician seeking payment who knowingly and willfully fails to promptly provide the appropriate diagnostic coding on the bill to the Medicare beneficiary upon the request of the Secretary or a carrier. If the physician knowingly, willfully, and in repeated cases fails, after being notified by the Secretary of the statutorily prescribed obligations, to include the requisite diagnostic codes, the physician may also be subject to administrative sanctions. However, the payment of an unassigned claim may not be prohibited solely because the physician has not furnished the diagnosis codes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We considered, but rejected, the idea of expediting properly coded bills and requests for payment since we do not handle properly coded bills for Part A services in a special manner. Properly coding bills is a standard requirement to receive payment for services. However, payment would occur more quickly for properly coded bills because there would be no need for resubmission because of errors in coding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A clinical laboratory stated that bills and requests for payment with diagnostic coding can be processed electronically at a much lower cost to Medicare than we projected in the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

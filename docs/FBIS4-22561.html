			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladyslav Omelchenko, political analyst: "The </F> Americans Promise to Give, but Hold on Tight"]    [Text] 11 March After returning from an official  visit to Washington, Leonid Kravchuk met with Ukrainian and  foreign reporters. He informed representatives of the mass media  of the results of his negotiations with U.S. President Bill  Clinton.    In Washington, they signed a joint declaration on  strengthening friendship and partnership between Ukraine and the  U.S., as well as a convention to eliminate double taxation and a  number of other important documents. Our president declared that  they will open new, broad opportunities for business partnership  and cooperation. It is very important for the young country that  during the negotiations Bill Clinton affirmed American support  for independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of  Ukraine.    Yet, euphoria from declarations and mutual congratulations  appears to be on the wane. A sober assessment of the package of  agreements from the point of view of Ukraine's interests comes  to the fore, especially of those among them which concern  security, economic stabilization and market reform. This was  confirmed by the presidential press conference, which attracted  a record number of correspondents.    Leonid Kravchuk had to make use of all of his political and  diplomatic talents to come up with answers to a flood of  questions from journalists.    As expected, at the center of attention was concrete  financial assistance from the U.S. The Ukrainian president  returned from his visit with a suitcase full of assurances and  promises. The Americans once again showed that they appreciate  concessions. Once the tripartite declaration had been signed in  Moscow, the promised $300 million assistance for disarmament, as  though by magic, instantly doubled. It became $700 million. One  half of that sum will be earmarked for nuclear disarmament,  while the other half for the implementation of market reform.    Today, this sum means nothing, of course. It is only a drop  in a bucket.    Moreover, will these promised funds be forthcoming? The  Americans, as before, managed to give away their cake and to  hold on to it at the same time. They put many conditions on  their $700 million. Ukraine must first firmly embark on the path  to reform, which has become quite problematic given political  instability and renewed activity by pro-communist forces.  Another condition is that the money will be disbursed if nuclear  weapons are removed from the territory of Ukraine. On this  issue, it appears that there will be no impediments. Leonid  Kravchuk and his team gradually surrender positions on defense  under pressure from Moscow and Washington. Today, our northern  neighbor is effectively in sole possession of the Black Sea  fleet and is trying to turn Sevastopol into a Russian city.    It is hard to comprehend why a great European power would  surrender unilaterally its nuclear weapons, which give it solid  protection, in exchange for nothing but sweet promises. Perhaps  we really do not need those thousands of warheads. A protective  barrier could have been provided by one or two dozen rockets.  Naturally, a space-travelling nation could have found funds for  their upkeep as well as first-class specialists to take care of  rocket launching facilities. Incidentally, if it possessed  nuclear weapons Ukraine would not need to maintain a large  standing army which is currently bleeding our budget white.    There is another amazing thing: why are nuclear weapons  being  removed from Ukraine in such haste? President Kravchuk proudly  informed journalists that the first train transporting 60  warhead already crossed our border.    "Has a single train transporting nuclear fuel for our  nuclear  power plants crossed the border from Russia, as provided for by  the tripartite declaration?" asked one correspondent.    "Not yet," replied the president. This, according to him,  requires more time.    It is a pity that Leonid Kravchuk has already forgotten how  he rushed to transfer tactical weapons to Russia, and has looked  for promised compensation ever since.    These political games are being played at a time when  Russian  nationalists are playing their Crimea card and carry out a rabid  anti-Ukrainian campaign, and when Russia declared that it will  stop supplying natural gas to Ukraine.    Slyly and easily, the two super powers, having joined  forces,  effectively put us on our knees and now dictate the rules of the  game.    From President Kravchuk's responses, I could not figure out  by what physical mechanism American assistance be transferred to  Ukraine. There is concern that it could flow into the pockets of  organized criminal structures. Indeed, a large portion of  humanitarian aid has disappeared. For instance, there are  growing rumors that a large portion of the money promised by  Clinton will be used to buy soy beans from the U.S. Leonid  Kravchuk dismissed this as gossip.    In its previous issue, UKRAYINSKA HAZETA asked Mr. Miller,  the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, to explain to our readers the  system and timing for the transfer of the promised dollars to  Ukraine. For two years, the U.S. has been promising us financial  assistance. But, in reality, it turns out as in a Ukrainian folk  saying: "The lord promised me a warm coat, but his word is  warmer."</p>

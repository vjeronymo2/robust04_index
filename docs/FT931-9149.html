			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Bulletins set to battle price rises: How the Bank and Treasury promote policy THE BANK of England and the Treasury today wheel out the heavy artillery in their joint battle to convince the financial markets that the government will not take risks with inflation by cutting interest rates further. The Bank's 32-page inflation report - to be released as part of its quarterly bulletin giving an overall assessment of economic conditions and monetary statistics - is one of a number of measures designed by Mr Norman Lamont to bolster confidence in economic policy after sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism last September. At the heart of the discussion about monetary policy is the relationship between officials at the Treasury and the Bank. While the chancellor and his officials have the last word on interest rates, they rely on the Bank for advice, particularly about trends in currency markets. The report has been drawn up by a team of Bank officials headed by Mr Mervyn King, economics director, as well as Mr Eddie George, deputy governor of the Bank, who takes over as governor in July. As with all the Bank's official policy documents, the report has been given to Treasury officials for comment. Mr Alan Budd, the Treasury's chief economic adviser, and Mr Robert Culpin, the Treasury's most senior official in charge of monetary affairs, have cast an eye over the details. At the end of last week the report was ready for publication, although neither the Bank or the Treasury was willing to say whether the Bank had changed its draft as a result of Treasury remarks. Not everyone in the City is convinced that the reports will be an unadulterated view of how the Bank sees the inflation possibilities ahead. In the past, the Treasury has often requested changes in Bank bulletins to ensure they say nothing to conflict with the Treasury's own assessment of economic conditions. 'You'd be surprised at the time it has sometimes taken to resolve some of the arguments,' said a former senior Bank official. Until now, the Treasury - as the department having the final say on economic policymaking - has had the last word on any disputes about phrasing of the bulletins. The Bank insists that the procedure on the inflation reports will be different. It will take into account anything the Treasury has to say, but is much less likely than with the bulletins to change wording. A Bank official said: 'We've been given a clear responsibility by Mr Lamont to report on inflation and our repu-tation is on the line.' Sir Douglas Wass, permanent secretary at the Treasury between 1974 and 1982, now chairman of the European arm of the Japanese securities house Nomura, said even if the Bank thought inflation was going to take off it would be unlikely to say so for fear of upsetting markets. 'I look forward to reading the Bank's views on this subject but in the end I think they will say much the same as the Treasury but in a different language,' said Sir Douglas. Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Bank, said: 'The facts are that the officials involved with the inflation report have worked together under all the old arrangements (of consultations over official documents). These institutions aren't going to change their ways just because the chancellor has asked the Bank to produce a new sort of report. I'm not expecting very much.' Observer, Page 17</p>

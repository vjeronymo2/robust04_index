			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondents Viktor Demidenko and Alexey </F> Petrunya]    [Text] Kiev January 20 TASS -- The Antonov scientific and  technical aircraft centre has designed a new air liner, AN-70  transport aircraft, which is to be produced by three former  Soviet republics -- Ukraine, Russia and Kazakhstan.    The rollout ceremony was attended by Presidents Leonid  Kravchuk of Ukraine and Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, who  is currently on an official visit to Ukraine.    According to chief designer Pyotr Balabuyev, the new plane  is  intended for carrying cargoes and equipment by civil aviation  and the air force. The aircraft can carry up to 30-35 tons of  cargoes for a distance up to 4,000-5,000 km at a speed of  750-800 km/h. The first air liners are expected to be put into  service already in 1996.    Experts believe that the new aircraft can replace the  U.S.-made C-130 Hercules and the European-made C-160 Transol  presently used in West European countries.</p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Nikkei at a high as Europe stays quiet The Nikkei 225 benchmark index hit a new high for the year of 20,838.97 yesterday as the volume of shares traded rose to 600m from 523m on Friday. In Europe, London was on holiday and Frankfurt and Paris were subdued, but the Dax index eventually recovered to 2,129.76 in the afternoon from the 2,112.80 it saw at the close of post-bourse trading on Friday. The CAC-40 index closed a fractional 1.84 higher at 2,052.51 in very low turnover. Eurotunnel attracted attention from investors, the shares rising more than 5 per cent, but the buying was said to be technical. Swiss equities saw the reverse of the coin, the SMI blue chip index breaking two resistance lines, at 2,720 and 2,740, before it closed 31.0, or 1.1 per cent, higher at the day's high of 2,742.9. The financial sector enjoyed strong support. In Milan the feature of the session was a strong performance from construction stocks following the government's announcement late on Friday that it was to encourage investment in this sector. In Amsterdam the Aex index advanced slightly to 402.42, with Philips, the electronics group, standing out. European bond markets received little impetus in the absence of US and UK market participants due to holidays. German and French bonds edged cautiously higher in light volume, while the rest of Europe remained little changed from Friday's close. Market participants this week will focus on bond issuance in Germany, France, Italy and Sweden. Moreover, traders will watch the Bundesbank's latest open-market operation tomorrow, seeking confirmation of recent comments from senior Bundesbank officials that the securities repurchase rate still has room to fall, even if official rates are on hold for now. The repo rate currently stands at 5.20 per cent, well above the 4.5 per cent discount rate which acts as a floor for money market rates. Amid continued uncertainty over the US interest rate outlook, European bonds will also continue tracking US Treasuries, where all eyes are on Friday's jobs data for April.

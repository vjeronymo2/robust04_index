			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: First Boston junk bond fund to be relaunched FIRST BOSTON Asset Man- agement is to relaunch its Total Returns junk bond fund to European investors, in the hope that changes in economic and market conditions since last summer have boosted investor interest. The fund, planned to total Dollars 250m, closed at Dollars 51m last September. Fund managers were putting off decisions, as they focused on the Gulf crisis and the decline of the US economy. The First Boston fund focuses on higher-quality paper, usually trading at between 60 per cent and 100 per cent of its par value. Mr Richard Lindquist, high-yield portfolio manager, said the market offers an opportunity for investors which will last only a few years, as companies achieve a greater balance between debt and equity. The First Boston fund, which has another 18 months to run, will close in May. Mr Lindquist said the fund hopes to raise a further Dollars 50m to Dollars 100m. He said a much larger fund would be difficult to manage, because the Dollars 220bn junk bond market has lost much of its liquidity, since the demise of specialist firm Drexel Burnham Lambert early last year.</p>

The Washington summit between Leonid  Kravchuk and Bill Clinton, already postponed twice, is  provisionally scheduled for 12 March. This will be Leonid  Kravchuk's third visit to the United States as Ukraine's Supreme  Council chairman and president.    The head of the government delegation, Ukraine's Economy  Minister Roman Shpek, said in an exclusive interview for UNIAN  before departure: "It is too early yet to speak of the size of  credits to be granted to Ukraine. However, after hard work with  the American side and international financial organizations,  Ukraine can count on a total of $2 billion, including a system  transformation loan (STL), a stand-by credit, and a  rehabilitation loan. It is more important to convince the  American side that Ukraine's leadership realizes the depth of  the crisis processes in Ukraine and, most significantly, has a  political will for reforms."    Roman Shpek said he hopes to convince the Americans of  Ukraine's intentions to pursue market transformations by  fighting hyperinflation, as well as setting up a Ukrainian bank  for reconstruction and development, and a national insurance  company to safeguard investments and credits.    The delegation also includes Ukraine's National Bank  Chairman  Viktor Yushchenko; Deputy Foreign Minister Oleksandr Makarenko;  Deputy Finance Minister Borys Sobolev; Serhiy Osyka, deputy  minister of external economic relations; Anton Buteyko, adviser  to the president of Ukraine for international affairs; Valeriy  Pavlyukov, deputy minister of machine-building,  military-industrial complex and Conversion; and other experts.  According to some reports, Ukraine's Deputy Premier Valentyn  Landyk and Minister of Finance Hryhoriy Pyatachenko dropped out  of the delegation at the last minute under pressure from the  American side.    The program of the visit includes meetings at the U.S.  Congress, the State Department, other departments, the Federal  Reserve Bank, and the IMF and World Bank headquarters. A total  of 20 meetings are planned, Deputy Foreign Minister Oleksandr  Danylenko [name and title as received] told UNIAN, as well as  the initialing of a bilateral agreement preventing double  taxation, and an agreement on promoting and protecting  investments. These agreements are to be signed during Leonid  Kravchuk's visit to Washington.    "At the IMF, we will discuss the preparation of a program  for  STL system transformations, which will become a step toward  receiving a stand-by loan," Roman Shpek told UNIAN. "If the  preparation of the STL program proceeds without delay, the IMF  will hopefully approve the relevant documents in four months.  At the same time, we will negotiate a rehabilitation loan with  the World Bank."    Confidential sources reveal that the success of the visit  will also be crucial with regard to the United States granting  Ukraine a temporary beneficiary status in the generalized system  of preferences which, as a concession in trade relations with  the United States, has not been available to any other CIS  country.</p>

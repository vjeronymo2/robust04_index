			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Off to the circus TEARS rolled down my face as the Olympic opening ceremony in Barcelona pulsed towards its climax last Saturday. Of course it was bread and circuses, an astoundingly expensive show choreographed and paid for by some of the top brains on Earth - Washington, the CIA, Peking, Kodak, Coca-Cola, Reebok - so as to keep our minds off the woes that wrack our planet. But I am a sucker for a circus. 'Look at this, Miss Lee,' I shouted as my executive assistant entered from the garden where she is supervising the erection of a small Greek temple. 'The Spaniards have done us proud. This is mankind at his finest - 21 goosebumps-per-minute in a show costing millions and beamed out to all of us, billions of us little people, sitting in our homes. They are worshipping the old gods. We are reverting to our roots. The planet is going pagan.' Miss Lee was non-committal, but the energy and oomph of the opening ceremony were still paramount in my mind on Thursday when I was summoned to Barcelona by the UK sports minister, who is lurking in a villa high in the hills to the west of the Olympic city. I did not catch his name, but I was sure it was the sports minister because the topic of our meeting was how to handle the Manchester Olympic Games eight years from now, assuming that Manchester, which is somewhere north of London, succeeds in its bid to stage them. The minister was wearing a variety of sports equipment, including streamlined pixie shoes borrowed from the British cycling squad. 'Hurry up, Julian,' he shouted at his secretary as Julian served mineral water. Julian is a taekwondo black belt and a member of the Young Conservatives. 'Right, Michael,' said the sports minister from behind his fencing mask. 'Chop-chop, quickie-lickie. Tell me, in 200 words, how Manchester can trump Barcelona when Britain stages the millennial Olympics in 2000. Forget the tedious sport. What about the opening ceremony? John Major is giving me untold millions to secure the Games for Manchester. He'll want his money's worth. Do you think this drugs business will foul Britain's chances?' 'Certainly not,' I said. 'Drugs are complicated. Who is to say what's what. As for Manchester's opening ceremony, you Tories can score a massive PR coup, for yourselves and for Britain. 'Take sports technology. Britain leads the world. This week's jubilation over Chris Boardman's superbike was not a flash or fluke. I have been talking to the manufacturers. Britain is poised for a golden breakthrough in all Olympic sports. Have you heard about our Stealth javelin? It flies out of the stadium. Or our breakthrough discus? Our leading-edge archery bow or our carbopolyphilla-333 arrows? Our 21st century yachting keels? Our hush-hush rifle with antigrav sights in which Nato is sorely interested? The new British volleyball? Handball? Tennis ball? Boxing glove? Sabre? Swimwear? Hockey stick?' The minister was scribbling furiously; Julian had started to whoop. 'Some of these British inventions are still in pre-production, but others are set to roll. At the Seoul Olympics four years ago, minister, Britain finished 12th out of 160 nations on the medal table. But my projections show that by the time of the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, Britain will be equipped to win 78 per cent of all available medals. Four years after that: 96 per cent. 'This technological majesty must star in the Manchester show. And it is not just sports equipment. There is plenty more to make a fuss about - Britain's achievements down the ages as well as our current renaissance. 'It was Britain that smashed the atom, invented the egg-timer and the roulette wheel. Also the double-boiler. We invented almost everything. Britain leads the space race. We are discovering miracle processes faster than the Japanese. Our wine makers are peerless, our fashion better than Paris's, our film industry eclipsing Hollywood. And what about our songs? 'Norman Lamont is right, you know. He gets a bad press because of his blow-wave. But there are green shoots everywhere. We're not having a recession, just a bit of a pause.' The minister was stupefied. He said: 'Can you stay to dinner?' ''Fraid not,' I said. 'Must catch a plane. Governor Clinton needs me.'</p>

The first batch of the humanitarian cargo to include high-  precision medical equipment and diagnostics instruments will be  sent to Belarusian hospitals in mid-December. The other will be  supplied in Minsk by February 1994.    According to a report of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, the  action will be done within the framework of a 100 million dollar  program of assistance to former Soviet republics.

			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BALTIC AND EASTERN EUROPE  </P> <P> The spate of articles on the Baltic illustrates one more ghost of the Soviet  Union's past that begs excoriation. For 50 years the existence of secret  protocols were denied. Now they are finally acknowledged, but the necessary  conclusions apparently are still too painful for the Soviet Union to admit.  </P> <P> The fact is that the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania never  joined the Soviet Union voluntarily. If Gorbachev is sincere about glasnost, he  should admit the wrongs of his predecessors and let these people go. When the  Balts by the millions are signing petitions demanding independence, when their  respective legislatures are passing resolutions declaring their sovereignty,  and when millions of people join hands in a human chain from Talinn to Vilnius  to demonstrate their solidarity, I think this is a historic opportunity to come  through as a truly great leader by admitting that the Balts were wrongfully  absorbed.  </P> <P> Just as small countries like Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark are peaceful and  useful neighbors amid larger countries, the same can occur in the Baltic  region. Instead of being restless and complaining members of the Soviet Union,  the independence of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia would advance peace and  mutual respect in the region.  </P> <P> ROLAND A.

Speaking at a press conference at South Africa's Ciskei  Embassy in King William's Town, leader of the TEC mission to the  territory, Zam Titus, said the TEC was going to ensure that the  CDF was "brought aboard".    He said the TEC team had no direct communication with the  homeland army. It had spoken to some army representatives at  Bisho stadium earlier on Wednesday, at the rally which was to  have been addressed by former leader Brig Oupa Gqozo. "They  indicated then they wanted to regroup as an army and reassess  their situation and their position."    He said the "CDF situation" was being addressed at a high  level. "But I can't really make any announcement right now.  I'll be contacting a number of eminent leaders in South Africa  tonight on the matter."    He said he did not know who was in charge of the CDF but was  given to understand by the SA Defence Force that they knew.    Earlier, a highly placed source in the Ciskei government  said  he understood that members of the CDF had told Brig Gqozo on  Wednesday afternoon that they wanted him back as head of state.  Asked if this could not be merely to ensure that Brig Gqozo  dealt with their pension problems, he said: "That's not the way  I heard it. The military were cross with the police. It seems  there might be some tension there."</p>

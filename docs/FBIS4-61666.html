			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Cabinet of Ministers has adopted a  resolution -- international and interstate transit rail freight  by the republican railways will be done on the basis of  agreements on international railway goods traffic.    With the aim to ensure that railway traffic costs are paid  in  full on international and interstate routes (in the Commonwealth  of Independent States) and to speed up payments, it was decided  that as of 1 May 1994, international and interstate railway  freight will be in accordance with the agreement on  international railway cargo carriage, which came into force on 1  November 1951. [passage omitted]    In accordance with the existing international practice of  charging, it will be done by a dispatcher of freight at the  station of shipment for the distance from the shipment station  to the border exit railway station of the Republic of  Kazakhstan. For transit freight on the CIS railway routes --  through forwarding agents, which are set up by railways,  juridical bodies, or individuals, irrespective of their form of  ownership. The recipient of shipment is expected to pay for the  distance between the exit railway station of the Republic of  Kazakhstan and the station of designation.    The Ministry of Transport has been instructed to determine a  procedure agreed to by the railway administrations of  neighboring CIS states for applying tariffs and calculating  freight charges for haulage, carried out by residents of  Kazakhstan at railway stations, located on the territory of  Kazakhstan and not belonging to the railways of the Russian  Federation, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan. The ministry is also  expected to elaborate a procedure on applying clauses of an  agreement on shipment documents and on carriage charging costs  on international and interstate routes. Rates of additional tax  will be endorsed in case of exceptional cargo value and a tax on  amends to freight agreements, introduced at the request of a  freight-owner. [passage omitted] Freight rates will be computed  in Swiss francs.    Tariffs for the transit of other state's goods by  Kazakhstan's railways will be in hard currency or any other  agreed currency. Residents of the Republic will pay national  currency -- tenge -- for export-import freight of goods within  Kazakhstan and for the same kind of freight. Nonresidents of  the Republic are expected to pay in Kazakhstan's national  currency or hard currency.    Conversion of hard currency into tenge will be done  according  to the National Bank's of Kazakhstan exchange rate on the day of  payment.    It is established that compulsory sales of currency earnings  received for freight of goods is done after placing them to  railways's hard currency accounts.</p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Letter: Base rate cut to tame markets Sir, Why has the government failed to lower interest rates significantly after achieving a 15 per cent devaluation of sterling? Industrialists accepted reluctantly a 10 per cent base rate as the price for remaining in the ERM when the severity of the recession in the UK required a base rate no greater than America's equivalent, which is only 5 per cent. Having been forced out of the ERM, there should have been an immediate reduction in base rates by as much as 4 percentage points. Sterling might then have fallen further than the 5 per cent it lost in the first few days, but probably not lower than the current level of 15 per cent. Furthermore, a 4-point reduction in mortgage rates would have reduced the retail prices index by 2.6 per cent, going some way to offset the increased cost of raw materials caused by devaluation. The failure to make a large cut in interest rates means that the currency speculators can continue to speculate against sterling knowing that by stages base rates will be reduced and therefore they can expect a one-way downward market in sterling for some time to come. While we cannot 'beat' the currency markets, we can at least understand how they operate and thereby try and have them speculate in our favour rather than against us. This result can still be achieved by a further immediate substantial base rate cut. With a combination of the likelihood of UK base rates thereafter being increased as the economy recovers and German base rates being reduced owing to the gathering recession in Germany, we may expect that in the course of next year sterling will rise and the D-Mark will fall, so that Britain's re-entry into the ERM may become possible. Meanwhile we are suffering the worst of both worlds with depreciated currency and high base rates. Anthony Jacobs, 9 Nottingham Terrace, London NW1 4QB</p>

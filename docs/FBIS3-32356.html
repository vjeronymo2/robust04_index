Although it is true that the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador  did limit itself to telephonically notifying the Foreign  Ministry on the circumstances involving the death of Mr. Diaz  Alvarado, this Ministry hereby states that in no way was it  requested to issue a permit in favor of Maj. Lopez, and in any  case, it is not up to this Ministry to issue said exit permits.    "2. Communication between the Embassy of the United States  of America and the Foreign Ministry was limited to a telephonic  report on the circumstances involving the death of Mr. Diaz  Alvarado the same morning events took place, and that since Maj.  Lopez had diplomatic immunity, the U.S. Embassy committed itself  to put him on trial a per U.S. laws, as stipulated by the Vienna  Convention with respect to diplomatic relations. This Foreign  Ministry has been able to confirm that Maj. Lopez is accredited  as a U.S. diplomat in our country, and as such enjoys diplomatic  immunity. Subsequently, that afternoon the U.S. Embassy once  against contacted the Foreign Ministry to report that Maj. Lopez  had left El Salvador in order to be put at the disposal of U.S.  judicial authorities through a court martial.    "3. This Foreign Ministry in due time requested information  from the U.S. Embassy as well as from the Salvadoran immigration  authorities on the circumstances and procedures used by Maj.  Lopez in abandoning the country.    "4. Due to the fact that explanations provided by the U.S.  Embassy are not sufficiently satisfactory, this Foreign Ministry  has been forced to send a protest note to the U.S. Government  through its embassy, at the same time demanding penalties for  those responsible for breaking El Salvador's immigration and air  transportation laws.    [Issued] San Salvador, 4 Feb 1994."</p>

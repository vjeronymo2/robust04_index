			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Arts: Kurt Equiluz - Recital Kurt Equiluz has for many years been a famous exponent of Bach's oratorios in all the world's important Bach-performing cities. As a Lieder singer he is much less widely known. Tuesday's recital at the Wigmore Hall was his first in London - a remarkable and, indeed, memorable debut in more ways than one. According to the New Grove Dictionary of Opera the Austrian tenor is only a few months short of his 64th birthday, an unusual age for a singer to be confronting new audiences; but it seems Mr Equiluz won many admirers during his recent spell of teaching at the Pears-Britten School in Aldeburgh, who persuaded him that his wares simply had to be displayed further afield. They were absolutely right. Lieder-singing of this kind and quality is unfamiliar. The kind is perhaps not to every taste. Mr Equiluz's instrument is extraordinarily well preserved, and used with a skill that affords in itself a sort of master-class vivant; but it has little flesh left on the tone, juice in the timbre, and therefore allows him little room for expansiveness or physical exultancy. Every line comes out 'light' - but as it is a lightness turned unfailingly to artistic ends, Mr Equiluz's singing of Schubert, Wolf, Joseph Marx and Strauss swiftly moves his audience worlds away from the modern mode of Lieder-listening. He operates with absolute confidence according to the 'less is more' maxim: the slenderness of the sound is allied to the utmost precision of tonal and verbal shading, to a wonderful charm and delicacy in every phrase and sentence. In the opening Schubert songs - 'Liebesbotschaft' and 'Standchen', from the Schwanengesang - one could almost feel the dimensions of an already intimate and welcoming performing space shrinking still further around the voice and the personality. In the best way, the 'domestic' communicative side of Lieder-singing seemed to be re-awakened. Wolf thus treated, Wolf not dressed up with bright interpretative lights and expert cosmetic applications, is a revelation. True, there were a few songs on the programme (properly requiring a greater degree of vocal weight and emotional force than Mr Equiluz could summon; and certainly, the voice was not always treated with the appropriate tact by Margot Fussi's meaty piano-playing. But altogether this was an experience of rare and delightful freshness. I could easily imagine Mr Equiluz becoming a cult figure among London's Lieder-loving public.</p>

With 256M DRAMs, which are expected  to require &yen;100 billion to &yen;200 billion for R&amp;D and a  few times more for mass production, the point is how to make it  possible to produce efficiently while minimizing plant and  manufacturing equipment investments.[.sup]1[/] In general,  this is being attempted by using the same manufacturing  equipment to produce several generations of devices and refining  existing process technology. However, with regard to  quarter-micron devices, limits in manufacturing technology and  processes have already been seen, particularly with multi-layer  wiring.    This report describes the present status of metal CVD  technology for multi-layer wiring and the necessary equipment  configuration for it.  <H5>  Problems in Multi-Layer Wiring </H5>   Table 1 shows the problems to be studied for multi-layer  wiring used with 256M DRAMs.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

Meanwhile, CVD-single-crystal  Al recently developed is attracting attention for its resistance  to wire breakages.[.sup]2[/] High melting point metals such  as W and Cu are expected to be used as wiring materials to  replace Al because these metal atoms hardly cause migration. The  problems studied for blanket W wiring include increased  throughput, particle reduction, stress reduction, and decrease  of resistance. Since the current density increases as the wiring  becomes finer, the generation of Joule heat cannot be  disregarded, with W having a higher resistance than Al. It was  recently found that W with a resistance of about 7 microhm-cm  can be formed into film-by-film fabrication using  diborane.[.sup]3[/] On the other hand, it is essential to use  bond layers to prevent the separation of blanket W and, due to  the physical limit of TiN coverage by sputtering, the CVD of TiN  is being studied in this context. CVD-TiN with high coverage and  low temperature can be used in Al multi-layer wiring and is  expected to be used as plugging technology replacing W. Film  fabrication utilizing hydrazine reduction[.sup]4[/] was also  developed recently. It is expected that composite wiring  technology of CVD-TiN and CVD-W will be used in next-generation  processes. With wiring formation by CVD-Cu,[.sup]5,6[/]  problems include the method of supplying a stable liquid source,  etching, Cu oxidation and so on.    Contact holes and via holes can be plugged with blanket W or  selective W, which are being studied from the viewpoints of  process and cost. Since selective W makes positive use of  chemical differences on the surface, a cleaning process is used  before film fabrication to remove natural-oxide film. Selective  W should guarantee selectivity for a variety of inter-layer  films. Plugging with blanket W, at least three processes, TiN,  blanket W, and etch-back, are necessary so stacked wiring should  be advanced, resulting in a cost disadvantage in the age of 256M  DRAMs where productivity is especially important. Therefore, the  simplest and most effective method may be to use selective W for  plugging, and form multi-layer wiring by sputtered Al.  <H5>  Clustering of Equipment </H5>   To improve the reliability of multi-layer wiring for 256M  DRAMs to a similar or better level than existing devices,  plugging and wiring using CVD films with excellent coverage or  stacked wiring combining CVD film and sputtered film may be  necessary. To fabricate low-resistance contacts, interface  control is important to remove natural-oxide film and  contamination on the contact surface and form a clean surface  with good reproducibility. Particularly, attention should be  paid to residual oxygen or moisture when fabricating Al or Cu  films. From these viewpoints, studies are being conducted into  the combination of sputtering and CVD and into clustered  equipment consisting of several sputtering chambers or CVD  chambers.[.sup]7[/]    Figure 1 [photos not reproduced] shows the effects of  post-processing and continuous processing in selective W film  fabrication.[.sup]8[/] Films can be formed on wafers which  have been transported in vacuum after dry pre-processing, but  cannot with conventional wet pre-processing using  HF/H[.sup]2[/]O. Therefore, selective W must be combined with  dry pre-processing, which can be achieved with clustered  equipment. Figure 2 shows the contact resistance when sputtered  TiN and Al are formed into films continuously in vacuum or  discontinuously (with a period of standing in atmosphere) after  W film fabrication.[.sup]9[/] Contact resistance in the case  of in-vacuum continuous-film formation is lower than that of  standing in the atmosphere between processes. This is because  the W surface is oxidized in the atmosphere in the case of  discontinuous film formation, and shows the effectiveness of  in-vacuum continuous processing.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-21A>           Figure 2. Annealing Temperature Dependence of Contact </FIG>       Figure 3 shows typical examples of multi-layer wiring  processes, those for contact hole plugging and for via hole  plugging.[.sup]10[/] To use the reflow of sputtered Al for  plugging, a three-chamber configuration is required including  the base TiN and annealing chambers. Plugging with selective W  is based on a two-chamber configuration including a  pre-processing chamber. Plugging with blanket W requires four or  five chambers from pre-processing until etch-back so the scale  of clustered equipment becomes large. The etch-back process is  not necessary when blanket W is used directly for wiring. As  seen above, there are several available process combinations,  and it is important for the fabrication of multi-layer wiring to  select low-cost processes which emphasize productivity.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-22A>           Figure 3. Examples of Multi-Layer Wiring Fabrication </FIG>       On the other hand, the implementation of clustered equipment  is an approach for minimizing so-called process dead time by  increasing throughput by means of several identical chambers as  well as composite processes, the number of chambers based on the  processing time of each process. This makes the use of modular  chambers important. Figure 4 shows typical examples of the  layout of the chambers of clustered equipment.[.sup]11[/]   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-22B>           Figure 4. Examples of Chamber Configuration of Clustered </FIG>     <H5>  Advantages of Clustered Equipment, Future Topics </H5>   Table 2 shows the advantages of metal CVD, or generally  speaking, the clustering of wiring equipment, and future topics.  The biggest advantages include the maintenance of the fabricated  film surface with high reproducibility, the prevention of  contamination, and the reduction of processing time.       Table 2. Advantages of Equipment Clustering, Future Topics   Advantages                            Topics   Maintenance of deposited surface      Prevention of cross-contamination  with high reproducibility through     between sputtering and CVD  vacuum transportation   Prevention of foreign matter          General reliability of equipment  adsorption or contamination through  continuous processing   Reduction of processing time          Soft reliability of composite process  required for several processes   Reduction of footprint in clean       Development of several processes as a  room                                  total process   Possibility of combining desired      Reduction of cost  process chambers with a high degree  of freedom                                         Increase of throughput      It is said that more than 80 percent of the defects with 64M  to 256M DRAMs are attributed to particles or metal contamination  on the wafer. Particles and contamination are produced in the  film-fabrication chambers or during wafer transportation and are  influenced by the cleanness of the manufacturing line. In the  future, because the environment of the manufacturing line will  be "super-clean," particles and contamination will mainly be due  to the equipment. It is estimated from the above that more than  90 percent of the drops in yield of 256M DRAM-class products  would be due to particles and contamination.[.sup]12[/] In  consequence, therefore, the problems in the clustering of  equipment will include how to reduce dust production in  individual film fabrication chambers and the transportation  system. Particularly, with blanket W, if bonded layers are  fabricated from sputtered TiN, W film separation from the  periphery may occur depending on the TiN film state and the W  above the susceptor will tend to be the source of particles.  This will be dealt with by the use of uniform TiN film or a  method for prevention of W film formation around the wafer by  adjusting the mechanical clamp of the wafer or the gas flow.  Cleaning equipment is also being studied. On the other hand,  with the combination of the Al sputtering and CVD chambers, the  trend is the use of ultrahigh vacuum. Optimization of the  transportation pressure is necessary from the viewpoints of  cross-contamination and particles. In this way, the clustering  of equipment allows a combination of processes but requires high  system reliability and excellent maintainability. This is  because the increase of equipment size inherently degrades  reliability and, should the equipment fail, the wafer process  itself would be impossible. Therefore, the equipment's  reliability and operation ratio will be important bases for  judging equipment usable with 256M DRAMs.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   Increase in the scale of device integration has made plant  investment so huge that profitability has become questionable.  As a result, 256M DRAMs require rather simplified processes to  reduce production costs. Technology combining plugging with  selective W and sputtered Al is considered suitable for  economical multi-layer wiring fabrication, along with a high  manufacturing equipment operation ratio. On the other hand,  wafer size increase, process composition and film stability  requirements make wafer-level reaction chambers the most  practical and clustered equipment is suitable to use them. While  the selection of processes which are realistic from the  viewpoints of device and cost is necessary to implement the  above, how clustered equipment should be developed has not been  established at present because there are still various proposals  on the chamber configuration to be used. Therefore, to implement  multi-layer wiring for 256M DRAMs at low cost, the equipment  should be implemented based on specific data to prevent  over-specification, while presupposing the use of  high-reliability wiring. To achieve this end, the integration of  process development and equipment development will become more  and more important.  References    1. Kashiwagi, SEMICONDUCTOR WORLD (May 1992) p 115.    2.

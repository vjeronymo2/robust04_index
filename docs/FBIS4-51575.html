			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Feature" by Vansai Tavi-gnan: "Cooperate Appropriately </F> and Effectively in Foreign Investment"]    [Text] Respected listeners: Our party and state have  developed directions, plans, and policies to broaden economic  cooperation and relations with foreign countries. It is a  strategic program aimed at bringing about prosperity for our  multiethnic people as well as building and developing the  country. With the implementation of this line over the past  five to six years, our country has ushered in an era of  switching to the state-regulated market economy mechanism. With  this mechanism, we have advanced toward the achievement of an  economic and cultural structure intended to produce a large  quantity of goods in order to create conditions for an  accumulation of funds to develop the country.    The existing line and the law on the management of foreign  investment have created favorable conditions to attract and  encourage more and more foreigners to invest in Laos. Over the  past five to six years, domestic and foreign businessmen have  been allowed to invest in more than 350 projects in our country.  During the first part of this year alone, the Planning and  Cooperation Committee has given permission for foreign  businessmen to invest in a total of 43 projects in our country  worth $116 million. Of these, 27 projects have a total cost of  less than $1 million, 13 projects have a total cost of $1-5  million, and three projects have a total cost of more than $5  million. Total investment has doubled compared to last year;  last year it was $50 million. It has increased almost four  times over the first year in which foreign businessmen were  allowed to invest in our country. Investments by foreign  businessmen in our country are mainly in the agricultural,  forestry, industrial, and handicrafts fields. They have also  invested in the services, such as in tourism, hotels, and banks.  Most investors in our country come from Thailand, followed by  China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.    To make foreign management and investment efficient and to  provide legal guarantees for the just interests of each side, in  early March the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] National  Assembly endorsed a law on the promotion and management of  foreign investment in Laos. It was an amendment of the old law  on foreign investment, making it more suitable and in conformity  with the current new conditions regarding economic relations and  cooperation with foreign countries. In addition, to increase  investor confidence, the general provisions in Article Three,  Chapter One of the new law on the promotion and management of  foreign investment stipulate that foreign assets and investment  in Laos be fully protected by the laws and regulations of the  LPDR. They may not be requisitioned, confiscated, or  nationalized by the state unless it is necessary to use them in  the public's interest. In that case, foreign investors will be  compensated promptly in a rational and honest manner. All of  this shows that our party and state are pleased to cooperate  with all countries that have the good intentions to achieve  mutual benefit and respect each other's laws.    Although the law on promotion and management of foreign  investment has been amended in recent years as more foreigners  have invested in our country and the total value of investment  has increased, we still have many shortcomings that should be  settled attentively.    An example of such a weak point is that approval for foreign  investors to invest in our country has been authorized in a  hasty manner, without a careful examination or study of the  concrete details. As a result, brokers have taken advantage of  the situation to make contacts for foreign companies to gain  such rights. But when they gain the rights, instead of giving  them to the companies they work for, they sell them to companies  in other countries. This has cost foreign companies many years  before they could begin making investments. Worse still, when  the brokers fail to sell the rights, they do not report the  delay or cancellation of the investment rights to the  authorities. As a result, those who really want to invest in  these projects miss their chance. It has also created  difficulty and confusion in the work sectors concerned.  Approval of various foreign investment projects should be  clearly fixed on the basis of what levels are authorized by the  central level or the provincial level.    Another weak point is the confusion in the management  process. There are too many steps to take and too many  authorities that must sign papers. Moreover, there is a  shortage of cadres working in this branch. The cadres also have  limited knowledge and capability, thus inconveniencing investors.    There is an indication that foreign investment in Laos will  expand in the future. In view of this, in order to cooperate  with foreign countries appropriately and more effectively, it is  necessary to implement the law on promotion and management of  foreign investment even more strictly. The shortcomings must be  quickly settled. Appropriate methods must be studied and put  into actual practice in order to create conveniences for foreign  investors and make them confident that they will obtain  reasonable income that will gain by investing in Laos in  accordance with state laws. In addition, direct investment in  various forms of cooperation by foreign countries must be  promoted. Emphasis must be placed on investment in the  agricultural, forestry, and hydroelectric fields as well as in  the construction of the economic and cultural infrastructure in  order to produce goods for export. Investment in the services  field must also be promoted. This will create the conditions  for an accumulation of assets for the construction and  development of our country to make it stronger with each passing  day.</p>

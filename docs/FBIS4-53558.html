			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata's Cabinet endorsed Friday [20 May] a decision to freeze  hikes in public service charges until the end of the year,  officials said.    The decision comes after a barrage of public criticism over  recent rate hike plans in the midst of a sluggish economy.    Officials said the cabinet decision is intended to stem the  rate increases in domestic telephone charges, rent for public  housing, taxi fares, expressway tolls and fire insurance  premiums.    The cabinet will ask local autonomous bodies not to raise  fees charged for their bus and subway services, they said.    On Tuesday, Hata instructed chief cabinet Secretary Hiroshi  Kumagai and Economic Planning Agency Director General Yoshio  Terasawa to move quickly in putting a freeze on public utility  rates. Many political analysts said the freeze is Hata's  apparent bid to rally public support for his minority government  in the face of attacks from the opposition on his weak political  standing.</p>

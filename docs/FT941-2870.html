			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Haden MacLellan calls for Pounds 13m Haden MacLellan Holdings, the engineering group, yesterday announced a 1-for-4 rights issue to raise about Pounds 13m and 1993 pre-tax profits up from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 4.5m. Haden, with interests including paint finishing systems for the automotive industry and distribution of industrial fasteners and machine tools, wants to strengthen its finances to fund organic growth opportunities. Turnover rose from Pounds 294.2m, including Pounds 18.2m from discontinued activities, to Pounds 309.6m. A lower tax charge of Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 2.1m) left earnings per share at 3.5p (2.6p) and the proposed final dividend is held at 1p, making an unchanged 2p for the year. Mr Harold Cottam, chairman, said the strategic review which he initiated after joining the group in 1992 had established the way forward for the company, and the latest results showed it had achieved its first and most immediate objective of stabilising earnings. Process engineering and services lifted profits from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 3.2m, reflecting a turnround from a loss of Pounds 3.4m to profit of Pounds 1.5m in its restructured North American business. However there was a deeper-than-expected downturn in Europe and a Pounds 500,000 provision for closing the Spanish operation. In manufacturing and distribution, profits dropped from Pounds 4m to Pounds 2.8m. Manufacturing dropped to Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 1.8m), reflecting Pounds 1m of reorganisation costs, and distribution was unchanged at Pounds 2.2m with a good performance in industrial fasteners - identified as a core busienss for future growth - offset by a downturn on the machine tool side. The rights issue is priced at 62p per share, compared with yesterday's closing price of 78p, down 2p, and is fully underwritten by Schroders. De Zoete &amp; Bevan are brokers to the issue. Mr Cottam said the issue would be broadly neutral for shareholders and had received strong support from institutions. COMMENT A modest rights issue makes a good deal of sense. Net cash has fallen from about Pounds 18m at the end of 1991 to a negative Pounds 11.6m in line with the virtual disappearance of advanced payments and even, on occasions, phased payments, in contracting. Yet without the money, topped up over the next few months, perhaps, by about Pounds 7m from selling the Duport foundry business, Haden would clearly be unable to exploit the opportunities from its global leadership in paint finishing systems. Nor would it be able to take full advantage of the reorganisation and refocusing of the past 18 months. Shareholders will be encouraged by the company's intention to resume dividend growth once appropriate cover has been achieved, and, with a modest rise in profits this year as business picks up in the second half, the prospective p/e is between 15 and 16, based on the current shares.</p>

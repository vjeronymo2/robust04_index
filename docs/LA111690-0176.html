			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FAULTED FOR QUAKE PREDICTION, HE NOW SHAKES UP ECONOMISTS  </P> <P> Iben Browning has incurred the wrath of geologists and seismologists for  projecting a 50-50 chance for a major earthquake on the New Madrid Fault zone  in early December.  </P> <P> He may soon be getting in trouble with economists.  </P> <P> During a presentation Thursday to a St. Louis business group, the New Mexico  scientist said it appears that conditions are right for the world to fall into  a depression in 1992.  </P> <P> "For climatological reasons, we will reach the bottom of the depression about  the end of 1992. . . . I expect (it) will be the most severe since 1776, more  severe than the 1930s," Browning said.  </P> <P> Among other things, he said that:  </P> <P> * High tidal forces have affected such things as the size of the wheat crop in  the Soviet Union and the rise of Nazism before World War II.  </P> <P> * Volcanoes cause acid rain, not coal-burning factories and power plants.  </P> <P> * The temperature of ice in Greenland affects the world economy.  </P> <P> One thing he didn't spend much time talking about was his projection that  strong tidal forces could touch off a major earthquake in the Midwest about  Dec. 3. He also had nothing to say about the overwhelming criticism it has  prompted.  </P> <P> "That would be a waste of time. I'd rather just stick to my work," Browning  said.  </P> <P> Although he referred to his projection as a "guesstimate," he said he was  confident in his reasoning.  </P> <P> Earthquake experts say there's a good chance of another quake in the region  eventually but have dismissed Browning's theories.  </P></p>

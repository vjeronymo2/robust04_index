			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Travelling the electronic highway: A Herefordshire town is moving closer to becoming a fully fledged telecentre KINGTON IS wiring up. The small town in Hereford and Worcester is becoming an electronic community under a national pilot scheme to study the impact of new technology on rural areas. The computers and equipment arrived quickly in the town, following its announcement 10 weeks ago that it had secured the scheme. Number Two High Street already has nearly a mile of cable in it. The bow-fronted Georgian building is turning into a telecentre as the focal point of the Kington Connected Community Project. The town's businesses, schools, clubs and tourist information offices are being offered equipment to link them to a local telecommunications network, which in turn is linked to a British Telecommunications service to give them enhanced capacity. The project is being sponsored by government and the private sector. Public-sector backers include the Rural Development Commission, the Department of Trade and Industry, while Apple Computer and BT are providing equipment and cash. They are interested in why the countryside has been slower to grasp the possibilities of the computer than cities. The main steps taken so far have been on the communications side. Sooner than BT had originally planned, Kington is joining the Integrated Services Digital Network or ISDN, a system of telecommunications which can transmit almost instantaneously anything which can go down a line - text, data, voice or image. Mr David Haskins, of BT's group products and services management division, says: 'Kington was due for exchange upgrading in 1994. It's been brought forward a year. ISDN will be available after the upgrading. Normally it comes on demand - you need a minimum of five heavy-duty customers.' There will be 15 lines running into the town - 'an electronic highway into Kington', as Mr Miles Swinburne, the local project manager, puts it. 'We have had to get the telecoms in before we can exploit the computers,' he adds. But these 15 lines will not run to individual BT subscribers. Rather they will run through a central box which can switch the ISDN connections around the community as they are needed - hence the small number of lines. ISDN can be received by BT customers on their existing cable connections. Ascom, the Swiss-owned group, is providing its Ascotel machines for this purpose. Its motive for coming to Kington is that, having recently received the technical approvals for the use of its machines, it wants the machines to be seen at work. Number Two High Street and the planned training centre at Lady Hawkins secondary school are the shop windows. Number Two High Street is alive with plasterers, carpenters and electricians, decorating, cabling and installing under the supervision of Systems Support Networking, a Cambridge company which has volunteered to help. The shop is the obvious link between the connected community project and the public. The conversion is attracting the curious, for which the project organisers are thankful. Interest in a new electronic future for Kington is building up, but is not yet overwhelming. The attendance at the meeting to elect a board for the the company set up to run the project was 80, from a population of more than 2,000. But while there has been little local publicity about the training possibilities, there is nonetheless a steady demand for training. Rothwell Group, the Apple agent which is supplying the computers, has had half-a-dozen of the first potential users, including a shopkeeper and hotelier, along for a one-day introduction. Each of these people will probably have the loan of one of the 30 computers Rothwell has provided. For a community which has seen its traditional farming base eroded, the introduction of the technology should help protect existing community activities and attract new businesses to the area - and convince them that Kington is not as remote as they might think.</p>

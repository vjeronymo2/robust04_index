			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Streamlined school tests published REPLACEMENTS for the national curriculum tests that were boycotted this year by teachers' unions were published yesterday to a divided reaction from teachers. The new tests for 14-year-olds are drastically altered from last year, accommodating complaints about the workload they created for teachers and attacks on their educational validity. Mr Chris Woodhead, chief executive of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, which has replaced the National Curriculum Council and the Schools Examination and Assessment Council, said the tests were 'strong and rigorous'. The tests have been streamlined, with English reduced from three papers lasting four hours to two lasting two hours and 45 minutes. Mathematics and science are both reduced from three one-hour papers to two papers of one hour. According to the Department for Education, the tests confirm the policy of slimming down the curriculum. Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: 'The boycott remains in place. The government has regularly produced estimates of the time the assessment and testing will take. It has always been wrong.' The Association of Teachers and Lecturers was more positive. Ms Gillian Wood, assistant general secretary, gave the tests 'a broad welcome'.</p>

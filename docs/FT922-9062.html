			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Sport: When father knows best - Tennis AS A breed they are by turns villified, appreciated, despised, applauded, pitied and cursed. Oh yes, and sometimes loved - but never understood and seldom given the credit for an atom of intelligence. Those among you who are fathers of teenage daughters will recognise themselves immediately. It is not easy being a father - particularly when your daughter is just an ordinary, fun loving multi-millionaire and the main source of family income. In Rome this week Karoly Seles, whose daughter Monica collects stuffed animals, and Stefano Capriati, whose daughter Jennifer collects records (both the 'youngest-ever' and 'pop' variety) have been suffering in the stands while their breadwinners have battled away on the slow red clay. When I sat watching the two girls play one another on a cement court in the quarter-finals of the Lipton event in Key Biscayne, Florida, seven weeks ago, the two sets of parents - Karoly and Esther, Stefano and Denise - sat at opposite ends of the court surrounded by the usual entourage of coaches, trainers, genuine friends and hangers-on. Before the match I was told by Pavel Slozil, the former Czech Davis Cup player who used to coach Steffi Graf, that his new charge, Capriati, would upset the favourite - in spite of the arguments he was having with Stefano about Jennifer's preparation. How right he was. As the 16-year-old Florida girl, raking the lines with relentless accuracy, inflicted the first defeat of 1992 on Seles I exchanged a smile with Slozil. How lucky, I thought, that Jennifer had the advantage of such sound advice and such an experienced practice opponent. At the far end Karoly and Esther hid their disappointment by sportingly applauding Capriati. The next day Capriati lost decisively to Arantxa Sanchez, a not unexpected result considering this was Jennifer's first tournament for two months. But at least she had recovered her zest for the game after debating at the start of the year (to the family's horror) whether to chuck it all up and resume her interrupted life as a happy, smiling teenager. Just two weeks after Key Biscayne, Jennifer lost unexpectedly in Hilton Head to the Czech Veronika Martinek, ranked 83. That was a bad result. But I'm sure Slozil did not guess what the result would be for him. Dismissal. Stefano, who had ended Jennifer's successful association with last year's coach Tom Gullikson to bring in Slozil four months ago, announced that from now on he would be in charge of the coaching, and the Florida trainer Laurie Schuett would be drafted in to work on Jennifer's puppy fat. Like any corporate chief, Stefano had to slim down his workforce in the middle of a recession. Slozil must have been smiling quietly on Thursday when Jennifer suffered another unexpected defeat in Rome, at the hands of the diminutive 20-year-old South African, Amanda Coetzer, ranked 31. As Stefano is discovering, the pit of parental pain is bottomless. Meanwhile, the irrepressible Seles had bounced back to break another record. By winning the Spanish Open two weeks ago in Barcelona, to claim her 25th career title at 18 years and four months, four months younger than Tracy Austin had been in 1981 when the American reached her quarter century. This was only Monica's 49th tournament whereas it took Austin 71. I hope Karoly bought her another cuddly toy to add to the collection. Chris Evert (another former child prodigy hand-reared by her father) had played one more tournament than Seles when she won her 25th title, and was a full nine months older, while Steffi Graf (also father figured) was eight months older and playing her 78th tournament when she passed the same milestone. Seles's 25 titles took only 217 matches, an average of 8.68 matches per title. Evert's 157 career wins averaged 9.26 matches, Navratilova's average for her 159 successes is 9.54 and Graf's is 9.6 for 63 wins. Whichever way you look at it, Seles is the best player to emerge in the era of Open tennis. She was the youngest winner of a Grand Slam crown in modern times when she beat Graf in Paris in 1990 at the age of 16 years six months (true, Lottie Dod was 15 years 10 months when she won at Wimbledon in 1887 but there were only five challengers that year); she won four Grand Slams in her first nine attempts (Evert's fourth came at her 13th attempt, Graf's at her 17th); and last year, aged 17 years 11 months, Monica became the youngest-ever World Champion. Although Karoly is nominally Monica's coach, all the ground work was done by Nick Bollettieri at his Academy in Bradenton, Florida. He helped the family to emigrate from Yugoslavia after spotting Monica as a 10 year old at the old Sport Goofy event in Orlando. After investing years of time, money and effort in honing her talents and protecting her from too much competition too soon, he was shocked and hurt to be cast aside without a word of thanks. Perhaps Nick should engage Slozil as an extra father figure to hit with the latest prodigy he is developing at Bradenton (yes there is one, but I have promised him not to divulge her name). Then they could both suffer as all fathers should.</p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Moslems blamed for Thai arson attacks THE THAI army has blamed Moslem separatists for a series of arson attacks on Sunday, in which 33 schools in southern Thailand were set on fire. No-one was injured in the fires, which were lit before dawn, but Thai newspapers said at least 12 of the schools were destroyed or seriously damaged. Gen Kitti Rattanachaya, the regional military commander, accused a hard-line faction of the Pattani United Liberation Organisation (Pulo) of having set the fires. 'I was stunned,' Gen Kitti told local journalists. 'I (had) just told the prime minister that the situation in the region was improving.' Thai Moslems, concentrated in the south, make up only about 4 per cent of the country's population. Religious freedom is guaranteed by the constitution, but Moslems frequently complain about the influence of the Buddhist majority, especially in education. Pulo has campaigned sporadically for the secession of Thailand's five southernmost provinces, and was blamed for a bomb explosion at Hat Yai railway station last year. The latest incidents could strain relations between Thailand and Malaysia, since Thai officials say that Pulo activists receive support from Moslem fundamentalists in Kelantan on the Malaysian side of the frontier. Last month, however, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia launched a 'growth triangle' designed to increase cross-border trade and investment between Thailand, Sumatra in Indonesia, and Malaysia.</p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: 94162 48950 00000 I POPPED round to Downing Street for a word with the prime minister last night, to urge him to poke his head just a millifraction above the parapet and to tell us what is happening to this weary, wracked planet. Like you, I am stunned by the swirl of events that are buffeting and harassing us. His manners never change. He is the courtliest soul imaginable. We entered his private sitting room. I sat on a floral sofa. 'Care for some food?' said the prime minister. 'One of the nicest things about this place is that they are happy to serve you anything, whatsoever the time of day.' 'Wonderful,' I said. 'I'd like eggs, bacon, sausages, tomatoes, mushrooms and fried bread, thankyou very much.' As we ate, I broached the subject of my visit. 'It seems to me, prime minister, that the time is fast approaching when you must do or say something - possibly something small: no one is counting on miracles - to relieve the confusion and dread that are stalking the land. 'Everywhere people look they see schism and breakdown. Paralysis of the world economy. Markets shaking and heaving. Europe on the brink. Poor old George Bush. Maastricht and Mitterrand. Wars flaring daily. Saddam still out-tricking us. Turmoil at the BBC. The House of Windsor quaking. The return of Lord Owen. Children rioting and swearing. Lord Beaverbrook insolvent. Some exceptionally dodgy weather. A great pall of horridness. 'If you ask me, prime minister, it is all getting a bit too pre-millennial for my taste: eerie and frightening, the sky a hideous purple, oceans glinting afire, earthquakes and tempests, paganism and metempirics. 'Yet no one is speaking up. You yourself, prime minister, remind me of an incident Paul Theroux writes about in his new travel book, The Happy Isles of Oceania. I happen to have a review copy, courtesy of the Books editor. 'Theroux is in Western Australia, plugging his latest novel. He visits a Perth newspaper. He is escorted to a cubicle where an 18-year-old boy is sitting at a tidy desk. 'Well,' says the boy, 'where shall we begin?' He has read none of Theroux's books. The interview goes nowhere. 'Finally, at the door, the boy asks his only literary question. 'How do you get your characters?' he asks. 'You just think them up?' ''Sometimes I think them up,' replies Theroux. 'And sometimes they appear before my eyes.' 'The trouble is, prime minister, that people are no longer sure whether you are a character they invented, or whether you just appeared. They find it a mystery.' 'It's remarkable you should say that,' said the prime minister, 'because the truth is that we - the world's leaders - are grappling with a genuine mystery at present. 'We seem to have encountered gridlock. Everything has stalled. We think it is pre-millennial. And it seems to involve pi. As you are aware, pi - a circle's circumference divided by its diameter - is a transcendental number. It starts off as 3.14159265 but its decimal places continue for ever - an infinity of decimal places. Or so it was supposed. 'Some scientists, however, have been using extremely powerful computers to see whether pi would eventually yield a pattern of numbers that contained some sort of code, a message from the Creator. All was going swimmingly until six weeks ago when the computers started to produce an endless sequence of noughts. Whereas we used to receive a never-slackening stream of unrelated digits stretching to infinity, all we are getting is zeros. 'Nor is that the end of it. All the Earth's strategic computer programs have thrown in the towel. We ask them the big questions, and out come noughts. I have talked to George about it, to Francois, Helmut, Boris. Everything is gridlocked, everything closing down. There seems to be no way forward. We are sure it is pre-millennial.' 'Are you worried?' 'What's the point of worrying? We are going with the flow, waiting to see what happens.' 'You don't have a plan?' Just then, all the red telephones on the desk started ringing. The prime minister answered one of them and listened very hard. The colour fled from his face. 'I am afraid you will have to excuse me,' he said, dashing for the door. 'If I am not back in 30 minutes, order a pot of tea.'</p>

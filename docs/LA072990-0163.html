			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FIGHTING CHANCE AT STARDOM;  </P> <P> TALENTED DEGRANDIS SETS TIMETABLE FOR SUCCESS AT PRO LEVEL AS A MIDDLEWEIGHT  </P> <P> A boxing quiz: Name a rough and powerful middleweight boxer from Massachusetts  who worked with the famed trainer-manager tandem of Goody and Pat Petronelli.  </P> <P> If you answered Marvelous Marvin Hagler, you are correct.  </P> <P> If your answer was Joey DeGrandis, you also are correct -- and, in all  likelihood, a relative or close personal friend of DeGrandis. Few in boxing  have heard of DeGrandis. But if words mean anything, DeGrandis just might  become a boxing great.  </P> <P> "He has all the tools," said Dan Goossen, president of the Van Nuys-based Ten  Goose Boxing Club, which recently signed the hard-hitting DeGrandis to a  contract. "He has a chin of rock and a very, very hard punch."  </P> <P> And from the boxer himself: "In two years I expect to be ready to fight any  middleweight in the world."  </P> <P> Big talk from a 21-year-old who has fought just once as a professional and was  forced in that bout to go the four-round distance to earn a unanimous decision  over two-fight novice Jason Burrel of Corona. Although Burrel avoided a  knockout, unlike most of DeGrandis' opponents in 26 amateur fights, DeGrandis  showed in that June 26 bout at the Country Club in Reseda that he does indeed  have a chin of stone. And heavy, thudding hands to match.  </P> <P> "Geez, I croaked a lot of guys as an amateur," DeGrandis said, his Boston  accent as thick as chowder. "And I hit this guy Burrel just as hard as any of  'em. And he kept standing. I kept going back to my cawnah after each round  saying to myself, 'What do I have to do to this guy?' He was tough."  </P> <P> DeGrandis quickly learned what many had been telling him: Amateur boxing is as  similar to pro boxing as a fishhook to a left hook. DeGrandis pounded his way  to the New England Golden Gloves championship in 1988 as a middleweight then  stepped up to the light heavyweight division and won the New England  championship again in 1989.  </P> <P> And along the way, he, in his words, croaked most of 'em.  </P> <P> "But the first pro fight was so different," he said. "For one thing, I was so  nervous before it started I was shaking. But once the bell rang I was OK. But  this guy wouldn't go down for nothing. When it was over, it was a great  feeling, though. But I found out that this is the major leagues. These guys are  very serious about boxing. It wasn't always like that against guys in the  amateurs."  </P> <P> DeGrandis will make his second appearance as a pro Tuesday night at the Country  Club when he takes on Orange County's Richard Jones, who will be making his pro  debut, in a scheduled four-round fight. Headlining the card will be Rafael  Ruelas of Arleta, the unbeaten featherweight who will bring an 18-0 record with  15 knockouts into a scheduled 10-rounder against veteran Rosendo Alonso of  Bakersfield (32-24-3).  </P> <P> DeGrandis' trail across the country to the Ten Goose Boxing Club was blazed by  an older brother, John, who cornered Goossen at a fight night at the Country  Club in the spring and told him about Joey, who had worked out for a few months  with the Petronellis at the same gym where they trained Hagler.  </P> <P> "We get this all the time," Goossen said. "Guys coming up to me saying they  fight or their brother fights or their uncle fights. I gave John my business  card and said to call me in two days. Most of the time, that's the last you  hear from them. But he called."  </P> <P> A few weeks later, Joey made the trip, and a meeting with Goossen was arranged.  After learning of DeGrandis' Golden Glove accomplishments, Goossen decided to  give the kid a chance. He sent him to the Ten Goose trainer, Joe Goossen, who  liked what he saw.  </P> <P> "Before anything else, we liked Joey," said Dan Goossen, who signed  International Boxing Federation middleweight champion Michael Nunn and now has  two rising boxing stars, Gabriel and Rafael Ruelas, in his camp. "He is a great  kid, a great person. That's how we size up our prospects first. A man has to be  a good person. We would not, however, waste anyone's time working with a very  nice young man who had no ability to fight."  </P> <P> That ability to fight came early for DeGrandis, one of four brothers in, well,  let's say in an area of South Boston that does not have many back-yard swimming  pools or Porsches parked in the driveways. None, at least, that are legally  owned by the residents.  </P> <P> "My brothers and me, we fought about anything," DeGrandis said. "And I had some  street fights with other guys. I didn't always go looking for a fight. Some  days I didn't want to fight at all. But other days I did."  </P> <P> He turned to ring fighting when he was 16, and DeGrandis found that he liked  that much more.  </P> <P> "I fell in love with the sport immediately," he said. "It was just such a great  challenge to me. I watched Sugar Ray Leonard develop into a great fighter, and  of course there was always Marvin. I met him a few times. Once I had my New  England Golden Gloves championship jacket on and Hagler looked at it and just  smiled."  </P> <P> Smiling, perhaps, at what he knew would be a long, perilous and painful road  ahead for DeGrandis. But it is a road, he said, that he is willing to travel.  </P> <P> "I wasn't always willing to do the work," he said. "I wasn't willing to get in  the best shape. But now, with Joe Goossen, I'm ready. I get up every morning  and run four miles and work hard the rest of the day to get in the best shape.  Joe pushes me, but now I want to do it.  </P> <P> "I'll take my time and let Joe and Dan work with me, and I'll work as hard as I  can. And someday, sooner or later, good things will come to me and this work  will pay off."  </P> <P> In the meantime, it would be wise not to make any unnecessary comments to  DeGrandis about that bit of an accent he has.  </P> <P> "I heah people talking about me," he said. "They say 'Bahston' and all that  stuff. But to me, Californians sound really goofy. All this brand new carrrr  stuff. It's a cah, that's all."  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SECOND HELPINGS / MAX JACOBSON;  </P> <P> SERVICE FASTER, YANKEE FOOD IS MORE AMERICAN  </P> <P> Hans Prager's Yankee Tavern has drawn a large, steady stream of patrons since  the day it opened last year, just plain folks who come for all-American fare  like pot roast, succotash and blueberry cobbler. Now I'm happy to say that any  of the restaurant's opening wrinkles have been totally ironed out.  </P> <P> I enjoyed a delightful dinner there this week; the service was speedier than I  remembered, and the food tasted more American than ever. Maine lobster bisque  is one of the best I've ever tasted -- rich, ruddy and velvety smooth, with  chunks of lobster like sunken treasure on the bottom. A large, tender T-bone  steak comes with perfect onion straws, lightly dredged in flour and crispy as  can be.  </P> <P> There is an excellent stuffed chicken that will remind you of the holiday  season, complete with cranberry relish and a medley of julienned vegetables.  And Monday nights even feature a clambake, with steamers, fresh lobster, boiled  potatoes and corn.  </P> <P> Don't forget about the excellent desserts. The restaurant's strawberry  shortcake, a superbly flaky sweet biscuit with a mountain of berries and fresh  whipped cream, has no equal in the area. Cobblers and cakes are exemplary, too.  </P> <P> The restaurant retains its harbor-side Cape Cod look. The enormous windows and  high-beamed ceiling give the room a lofty, spacious look, and the framed  watercolors of ships and nautical scenes recall a small-town art gallery. Now  Prager has added a champagne brunch on Sundays, featuring such down-home dishes  as silver dollar-size blueberry pancakes with Vermont maple syrup, poached eggs  with grilled ham and cheddar cheese rarebit, and skillet-browned roast beef  hash. The price includes fruit, fresh breads and muffins, and domestic  champagne. I can't wait for Sunday.  </P> <P> * YANKEE TAVERN  </P> <P> * 333 Bayside Drive, Newport Beach  </P> <P> * (714) 675-5333  </P> <P> * Open daily from 5 p.m. to midnight, and Sundays for brunch from 11 a.m.  </P> <P> All major cards  </P></p>

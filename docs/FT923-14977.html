			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Late index-linked selling interrupts Nikkei's rise LATE index-linked selling and profit-taking ahead of the weekend erased early gains, and the Nikkei average closed marginally lower, disappointing investors who had hoped that the index would post its first four-day rise since October last year, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average closed down 39.85 at 16,717.78 but ended 5.7 per cent higher on the week, having risen more than 1,000 points over the previous three days. The index fell to the day's low of 16,617.72 on early profit-taking but moved higher on buying by investment trusts, reaching the day's high of 16,956.06 in the afternoon. Volume fell from 337m shares to 330m. Advances led declines by 613 to 351, with 124 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 1.86 to 1,293.55 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.15 to 1,016.19. Investors were hopeful of an imminent cut in the official discount rate by the Bank of Japan, following a similar move in the US on Thursday. 'Investors are hoping that some decisions on monetary policy will be made during the Bank of Japan's branch manager meeting next week,' said an analyst at Daiwa Securities. With most institutional investors remaining absent from the market, speculative theme stocks led the activity. Taiyo Fishery, which is planning to breed blue-fin tuna, was the most active issue of the day, rising Y30 to Y491. But Nippon Formula Feed, the feedstuff maker which has also been popular for the same reason, fell Y32 to Y740. Investors were discouraged by restrictions on stock lending by Japan Securities Finance, the sole lender of stock for margin trading. Toyama Chemical advanced Y45 to Y765 and Green Cross surged Y149 to Y1,070. The two pharmaceutical companies were reported to be in joint development of an anti-Aids drug. Meanwhile, blue chip high technology issues fell back on profit-taking. Hitachi plunged Y17 to Y780 and Fujitsu Y9 to Y633. Some banks were also lower, with Industrial Bank of Japan down Y20 to Y1,610 and Sumitomo Bank retreating Y30 to Y1,390. In Osaka, the OSE average advanced 242.99 to 19,692.24 in volume of 13.3m shares. Roundup EQUITIES in the Pacific Basin were mixed yesterday, with no panic response to the overnight slide on Wall Street. Markets which moved seemed, indeed, to have stimuli of their own. Bombay was officially re-opened after closing for settlements on Thursday, but brokers refrained from trading. HONG KONG digested the Sun Hung Kai Properties equity funding, which turned out to be a HKDollars 3.3bn share placing, then regained some interest in the afternoon as it anticipated the prime rate cut which came after the close. The Hang Seng index fell 11.89 to 6,061.85, 0.8 per cent lower on the week, after touching a low of 5,985.22 for the day. Turnover dipped to HKDollars 4.10bn from Dollars 4.51bn. Brokers said that the market was worried that other property groups might follow Sun Hung Kai in making cash calls, and put pressure on share prices. MANILA tumbled across the board on heavy selling of Philippine National Bank (PNB) after news of changes in accounting methods at the state-owned bank. The composite index fell 36.41 to 1,477.16, 3.2 per cent lower on the week. Combined volume at Manila's two bourses rose to 3.1bn shares from 2.3bn, but slipped in value from 281m to 190.6m pesos. NEW ZEALAND offered a limited, but still positive, response to the low-key budget delivered by the finance minister, Ms Ruth Richardson, on Thursday night. Shares took their cue from a rally in the bond market and the NZSE-40 index rose 6.88 to 1,541.89, up 0.9 per cent on the week in turnover of about NZDollars 22m. Telecom was a major beneficiary of falling bond yields because of its status as the biggest utility stock; it rose 3 cents to NZDollars 2.11. AUSTRALIA rose a little more on persistent hopes of an interest rate cut. The All-Ordinaries index closed 1.5 higher at 1,663.2, its highest level since June 10 and up 1.3 per cent on the week. Firm gold prices underpinned mining stocks. Turnover slipped to ADollars 183m from ADollars 229m. KUALA LUMPUR returned from Thursday's national holiday, but many Malaysian investors stretched the holiday into a four-day weekend. The KLSE composite index closed off 0.39 at 596.08, fractionally higher on the week. SINGAPORE continued to retreat although modest buying at the close helped lift prices above the intraday lows. The Straits Times Industrials Index was down 7.63 at 1,484.10, down 0.6 per cent on the week. SEOUL dipped to the lowest level in nearly five years as rumours of failured among small businesses weighed on a weak market. The composite index fell 1.08 to 547.20, a fall of 0.9 per cent on the week and the lowest close since January 1988. The index would have fallen further if the stock market stabilisation fund had not bought 1.6m shares in the afternoon.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 28 June (AFP) -- Former Ukrainian premier  Leonid Kuchma, challenging President Leonid Kravchuk in  presidential elections here, will contest the validity of the  first-round election result with an allegation of vote-rigging,  a Kuchma aide said Tuesday [28 June].    Pyotr Lemek accused several local electoral committees of  falsifying votes to give Kravchuk an edge over Kuchma. A press  conference of the central electoral committee scheduled for  1100. (0800 GMT) Tuesday was delayed for several hours.    "Kuchma garnered 34 percent of the votes and Kravchuk 36  percent, and the difference is not eight percentage points as  (Kravchuk) aides maintain," he said.</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Root of the problem THREE YEARS ago I made a claim on my insurance for house subsidence. The insurance experts traced the cause to a large oak tree on adjacent land owned by a petrol company. This company was asked to cut the tree down but countered that the cracks were due to faulty construction. After repair to the house, the insurer paid for a 6ft deep concrete barrier. The land on the outside of the barrier has subsided, leaving a huge gap. Fortunately, no further movement has taken place at the wall of my property. New oaks are growing closer to my fence, and I am worried that these may overcome the barrier. The gap itself is unsightly, and even if it is filled, new ones will develop. I have tried to contact the company to ask it to cut the trees or let me cut them, but the department managing the land is difficult to contact and, in view of the original attitude, I expect no action. Is there something I can do other than taking court action to protect my property? Your only recourse would be to seek an injunction to restrain the continuance of the nuisance caused by the tree roots including, if necessary, an injunction based on the reasonable apprehension that a nuisance will arise in the future. The company can be contacted through its registered office, but unless it proves willing to co-operate, a court order is the only route to achieve what you require. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

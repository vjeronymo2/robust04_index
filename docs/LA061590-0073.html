			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAGUNA BEACH CITY WORKER ACCUSED OF EMBEZZLEMENT  </P> <P> A police sting operation led to the arrest Thursday of a city maintenance  supervisor suspected of siphoning money from city parking meters and change  machines that he emptied and repaired as part of his job, City Manager Kenneth  C. Frank said.  </P> <P> Dan Harris, 40, a Dana Point resident who has supervised the repair of parking  meters and the collection of money from them for about 14 of the 19 years he  has worked for Laguna Beach, was arrested on suspicion of embezzlement and then  released, Frank said.  </P> <P> The arrest took place without incident in the city's motor-vehicle repair shop  shortly after 8 a.m.  </P> <P> Frank would not comment on how much money Harris is suspected of taking.  </P> <P> "At this point we really don't know," he said. "It was a relatively small  amount. There's only so many quarters you can take."  </P> <P> Investigators believe Harris had been taking the money for about a year, he  added.  </P> <P> "We've been investigating him for about a month," Frank said. "We do not  believe that any other employees are involved. . . . (Harris) is cooperating  with police."  </P> <P> Frank said police conducted surveillance of Harris during working hours and  used marked bills and coins "to determine if money was missing."  </P> <P> He declined to say what led authorities to suspect Harris.  </P> <P> Reached at his home, Harris said, "I really don't want to talk to anybody right  now." He said he does not yet have a date for a court appearance and is still  in the process of getting an attorney.  </P> <P> Harris is the supervisor in a three-employee maintenance division. One of the  other two positions is currently unfilled.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Matt Lait and Jeffrey A. Perlman contributed to this story.  </P></p>

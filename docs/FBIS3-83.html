[Buthelezi, in English] We don't think that it's a matter  that's impossible to resolve as such because kingdoms exist in  Africa. There was a kingdom in Uganda -- I think there are four  kingdoms in Uganda, including the most (?northern) part of  Uganda. Kingdoms have been accommodated in the colonialization  period in Africa.

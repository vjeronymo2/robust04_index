So full marks to whoever thought of stressing the point in the latest advertisement for recruits to the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. Seeking to boost the entry in May, which is always smaller than its counterparts in January and September, the ad pictures a human spine with the catch-phrase: '150 jobs. One basic qualification.'

Surprised, Grant Duncan who handles the army account at advertising agency Collett Dickenson Pearce admits that a male spine was intended.

The response was proving quite good, it says, and anyway, 'it just shows our dedication to equal opportunities . . .'</p>

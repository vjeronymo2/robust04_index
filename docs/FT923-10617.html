			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / International Company News: Earnings rise at Placer Pacific PLACER Pacific, the Austra-lian gold mining group, yesterday said net earnings for the half year to June were ADollars 34m (USDollars 25.3m) compared with ADollars 24m in the year-earlier period. It said all the main mines it has an interest in met production targets. Placer, which is 75.8 per cent owned by Placer Dome of Canada, said production from the five top mines climbed to 1.19m oz, of which its share totalled more than 520,000 oz. The average price fell to ADollars 505 per oz from ADollars 524 in the same period last year. Tight controls cut production costs to ADollars 216 an oz from ADollars 258. Newcrest Mining, another Australian gold miner, said higher metal prices and productivity helped it recover from a poor first quarter, although net profits for the June half were down 9 per cent to ADollars 23m. The second quarter contributed ADollars 13m. Sales revenue for the half was ADollars 200m against ADollars 192m. Gold production was 13.1 per cent higher at 371,082 oz. Costs per oz sold were lower at ADollars 379, down from ADollars 382.</p>

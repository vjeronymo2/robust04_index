			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: European banks lift lending share European banks have sharply increased their share of international bank lending, at the expense of US and Japanese competitors, according to the latest survey by the Bank for International Settlements, covering the second half of 1993. The market share of European Union banks reached 45 per cent at the end of 1993, up from 40.6 per cent in 1990 and 34.8 per cent in 1985, while North American banks have seen their share fall from 27.8 per cent at the end of 1985 to 14.7 per cent at the end of 1993. Among EU banks, German banks have the largest market share, with 35 per cent, followed by French and UK institutions with 22 per cent and 16 per cent respectively. The decline of North American banks reflects their retrenchment from international markets, due to problem loans and the deterioration in their credits, and a refocusing on domestic lending. The BIS report also noted a shortening in the maturity profile of bank loans. The proportion of loans up to and including one year, which has increased almost continuously since 1989, breached the 50 per cent mark at the end of 1992, and stood at a record of nearly 54 per cent at the end of 1993. Cross-border claims were relatively static at Dollars 687bn, down slightly from Dollars 689bn in 1992 but up on end-1991 levels. However, the pattern of lending to developed and developing countries has shifted, with a rise of Dollars 33bn in lending to developing countries since the end of 1991. Lending to eastern Europe has fallen from Dollars 92.5bn at end-1992 to Dollars 83.9bn.</p>

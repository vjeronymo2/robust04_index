			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 24 Jun -- The State Duma has decided to meet  in plenary session three times a week during the time remaining  to the parliamentary recess. Until now it has been holding two  plenary sessions a week -- on Wednesdays and Fridays.    Communist Deputy Igor Bratishchev, who put forward the  proposal for an additional sitting, noted the Duma had a lot of  work to complete before deputies went off on their holidays. He  observed that many deputies were neglecting their duties by not  attending the Duma regularly. As an example, he cited his  political opponents in the Russia's Choice group. He claimed  that "30 percent of Yegor Gaydar's supporters do not turn up for  plenary sessions."</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIEWPOINTS;  </P> <P> SHOULD DEFENSE FIRMS SWITCH FROM SWORDS TO PLOWSHARES?;  </P> <P> A MOVE INTO CIVILIAN MARKETS MIGHT SEEM WISE, BUT MANY DOUBT ITS PRACTICALITY.  </P> <P> The recent announcements of major layoffs in Southern California by Hughes  Aircraft and Northrop Corp. illustrate how hard the region can be hit by a  slowdown in military spending. To protect communities against boom-and-bust  economic cycles, peace activists, union leaders and others are urging military  contractors to convert at least some of their production capacity to civilian  use. But would that sort of changeover really be in the nation's best interest?  And are the contractors capable of switching to non-military businesses? Times  researcher Melanie Pickett interviewed various experts on economic conversion.  Excerpts from their comments follow:  </P> <P>  A. Ernest Fitzgerald, author of "The Pentagonists: An Insider's View of Waste,  Mismanagement and Fraud in Defense Spending:"  </P> <P> "I don't know what (else) these guys can do. . . . they've got to be hooked to  the taxpayer's umbilical cord. They've had it so soft for so many years that  it's like taking a bunch of aging jocks who've done nothing but sit around the  bar at the country club and saying, 'Gosh, we're going to put you up against  the L.A. Rams.'  </P> <P> "We don't allow these giant firms to go bankrupt. . . . We have what amounts to  survival of the least fit. I don't see any reason in the world that they'd want  to voluntarily give up that easy life. Why would they? What other customer is  going to adjust your prices, your specifications and schedule to approximate  what you actually do? It's like shooting an arrow at a blank wall and then  drawing a target around it."  </P> <P> Seymour Melman, chairman of the National Commission for Economic Conversion and  Disarmament and a Columbia University professor of industrial engineering:  </P> <P> "As now constituted, there's very little that (military contractors) can move  into. In fact, they are disabled from moving into just about anything. There's  a record of aerospace factories attempting to make something civilian. The Rohr  Co. tried to make the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) trains; Westinghouse  Military Electronics tried to make the electronic control systems for BART;  Grumman tried to make a city bus; Boeing tried to make a trolley car. Every one  of these was a catastrophic failure. Failure in terms of the reliability of  what was produced. And failure financially. . . .  </P> <P> (To remedy that situation, Melman urged passage of the defense economic  adjustment act, a bill proposed by U.S. Rep. Ted Weiss (D-New York) to require  advance notice of major cutbacks at military plants.) "The cornerstone of (the  legislation) is the provision that, as a condition of the contract with the  Pentagon, military-serving factories, bases and laboratories above a given size  -- more than 100 people -- have to establish an alternative-use committee, half  named by the management, half named by the employees. The task of the  alternative-use committee is to produce a complete technical economic plan for  the use of people and facilities when the military work is done. In other  words, Los Alamos would have to set up an alternative use committee and make  proposals as to what the scientists, engineers and technologists in that place  can be working on when the work for the Department of Defense is done.  </P> <P> "Obviously, this isn't going to see light of day on the floor of the Congress  as long as the members of Congress are stuck with military Keynesianism, the  attempt to bring jobs and income to their districts by the military dollar --  but that is obviously running out of steam. The senators from California aren't  going to be able to do a damn thing about the Northrop and Hughes contracts.  The pork-barreling is over . . . because we've run out of resources."  </P> <P> Henry Berkow, executive director of California Unions for a Comprehensive  Mutual Test Ban and Economic Conversion for Jobs, Peace and National Security:  </P> <P> "The cutbacks are affecting the entire economy of the nation, primarily  affecting places like Southern California, Virginia, Texas and even New York. .  . . There's a domino effect to all this. It's not 6,000 workers here and 2,000  there. The layoffs affect the entire economy. . . .  </P> <P> "In the Soviet Union, they are taking the tanks that they've sent back and  they're converting them into plows and other things to use in farming. . . .  They've turned over 2,000 plants from the military to social needs. Now, they  need that, because they've been tied up in this war economy, too. But we need  it here, too. . . . (Contractors) can be producing pretty much anything -- they  can produce machine parts, they can produce new machinery, they can produce  material for bridges. The inner structure of our country is falling apart.  Bridges are falling down, roads are caving in. There is much yet to be done."  </P> <P> Michael Beltramo, a defense industry consultant:  </P> <P> "Even though it's an admirable objective, I don't know how realistic  (conversion) is, given what's going on in China and maybe what's going on in  Russia. I get real skeptical about these people that get the first outbreak of  peace and everybody wants to scrap everything. As a lot of people point out,  we're in a no-growth period, a retrenchment period, in defense, but there's  still a whole lot of business out there. Even when you see the story on Hughes  eliminating 6,000 positions, they talked about doing that by normal attrition.  But there's absolutely going to be a downturn in defense business. No doubt."  </P> <P> Marion Anderson, director of Employment Research Associates, consultants on the  economic impact of government policies:  </P> <P> "A basic concept of conversion and of conversion legislation is that these  people have to be retrained. You do not necessarily have to retrain a factory  worker who can make civilian electronics just as well as he or she can make  military electronics, but if you have a salesman who has dealt only with  generals and colonels, he might very well have to be retrained to deal with  department stores. He or she is going to have to think differently and deal  differently and, in fact, the whole product line has to be geared for something  quite different.  </P> <P> "In the civilian economy, you don't need to produce metals that can bear up  under thousands of degrees of heat, because in most uses in the civilian  economy you don't have thousands of degrees of heat. On the other hand, the  product has to be durable, relatively easy to maintain and it has to be quick  and easy to fix. It also has to be competitive in price. . . .  </P> <P> "There are tremendous capital and infrastructural needs within the United  States, and I have no question but that a number of the military manufacturers  could fill some of it. You have a lot of very talented people, and they could  start working on civilian goods."  </P> <P> California Assemblyman Sam Farr (D-Carmel), chairman of the Assembly Committee  for Economic Development and New Technology:  </P> <P> "What has happened historically in the aerospace industry when one company goes  down is that another one goes up after getting a new contract. There hasn't  been a real major dislocation, but in light of what you're seeing today, for  the first time we may have permanent dislocations the likes of which we haven't  experienced since 1976-1977.  </P> <P> "From a state level, the information we've given, we've been able to warn these  cities about how defense-dependent they've become. What we've not done a very  good job of is on the conversion side of it. Now that you know you're going to  be susceptible to impact, what can you do about it? The closures have been  faster than we've been able to put all our ducks in order."  </P> <P> Lawrence Skantze, retired Air Force general:  </P> <P> "There's a vast majority of the American people who want to feel that the  defense budget is reasonable and will maintain an adequate and strong defense.  I don't think you'd have that same consensus to say 'well now, let's now spend  that on solving pollution or homelessness. . . .' You will never get the  breadth of a consensus for that sort of thing that you can for defense, because  the average person who is a taxpayer, middle income, doing their thing, working  hard, recognizes they need a (national) defense and will support that.  </P> <P> "My experience has been, in the defense industry, there is some very bright,  sharp people and, once challenged with the idea of being competitive outside  the defense industry, I would feel very strongly they could do it."DR, Joe  Crabtree / Los Angeles Times  </P></p>

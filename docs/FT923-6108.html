			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Pounding the floor An eerie silence surrounds the Treasury and the Bank of England as sterling edges closer to its ERM floor. For those who had expected wholesale intervention when the pound breached DM2.80, the quiet is disconcerting. Government tactics seem to be to hold fire until it can see the whites of the speculators' eyes. While this runs counter to received wisdom in the ERM  -continental governments have tended to intervene early and raise interest rates in small steps - the strategy is not without merit. One aim is to let the foreign exchanges do as much of the work as possible. Unless dealers believe devaluation is imminent, they take a large risk in selling sterling short in sight of the ERM floor. The potential profits are small, but the risk of being caught by massive intervention and an interest rate rise is high. Consistent with the strategy of heightening unease, any support the Bank has offered sterling this week has been done very quietly through discreet banks. That said, this is a game of bluff. If the markets take the government on, the intervention and interest rate rises required could be large, and the wait until the French referendum on Maastricht is an eternity to the foreign exchanges. In any event sterling weakness is in large part the product of dollar weakness and mark strength. If that relationship takes another lurch, the Treasury's nice calculations could be blown apart.</p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD QUARTER CLOSES B OF A'S PROFITABLE YEAR  </P> <P> BankAmerica Corp., capping its first profitable year since 1985, on Thursday  reported record earnings for the final quarter of 1988.  </P> <P> The San Francisco-based company -- the nation's third-largest banking  organization and the parent of Bank of America -- said it earned $265 million  in the fourth quarter, up more than fourfold from $60 million in the same  period of 1987.  </P> <P> It was the sixth consecutive profitable quarter for the company, which once  appeared to be in turmoil because of troubled loans, primarily to Third World  countries.  </P> <P> The quarterly results boosted profit for 1988 to $726 million, in sharp  contrast with the previous year's $955-million loss, the company's largest.  </P> <P> Fourth-quarter profit was increased by last year's agreement between Brazil and  its creditor banks on a debt restructuring that ended that country's moratorium  on interest payments. For BankAmerica, the pact brought in back interest  payments totaling $351 million.  </P> <P> The company also cited increased business, reduced operating expenses and low  credit losses.  </P> <P> Don Crowley, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods in San Francisco, said  the results were better than expected and led him to sharply increase his  earnings estimate for 1989.  </P> <P> "Once you take out all the statistical noise in the numbers," Crowley said, the  result reflects "a very solid performance" by a bank with more than adequate  loan-loss reserves.  </P> <P> Wall Street analysts have speculated that BankAmerica, which has not paid a  dividend since recording its first annual loss in 1985, may reinstate it before  the company's annual meeting in April. But Chief Financial Officer Frank Newman  told reporters in San Francisco that he cannot yet say when the dividend will  be resumed.  </P> <P> BankAmerica common stock closed at $19 a share, up 87.5 cents, in trading  Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> Several big New York-based banking companies -- including J. P. Morgan &amp;  Co., Citicorp and Chase Manhattan -- also reported big gains earlier this week  attributed in part to the resumption of payments by Brazil, which had suspended  them from early February, 1987, to the beginning of last year.  </P> <P> On Thursday, however, big banks reported mixed results. Bankers Trust New York  Corp., the nation's ninth-largest banking group, reported fourth-quarter income  of $185.5 million, down from $284.5 million.  </P> <P> It blamed the drop on a $309.9-million decline in foreign exchange and other  trading revenues, which dwarfed its $95-million pretax gain in payments from  Brazil.  </P> <P> But Bank of New York, which last year acquired Irving Bank Corp. to become the  nation's 10th-largest bank organization, said fourth-quarter income rose to  $54.7 million from $45.9 million.  </P></p>

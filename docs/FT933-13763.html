			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Cabinet set to rule on review of councils ENVIRONMENT ministers are finalising revised guidelines for the Banham review of local government in England, following renewed pressure from local authority associations. The cabinet, however, is unlikely to make a decision next week because of Thursday's critical Commons debate on the social chapter of the Maastricht Treaty. Although this makes the precise timing uncertain, clarifying the task of the Banham Commission - which has already recommended creating 24 unitary councils in place of 66 county and district councils - is a priority for the Department of the Environment. Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, told local authority associations: 'Having had the first few proposals, there is sufficient comment for it to be ridiculous for me merely to say we'll go on exactly as we are. I hope to make some announcements very soon indeed.' Mr Gummer could: Speed up the review, which is expected to take another three years. Allow an 'opt-in' approach, where councils must invite Sir John Banham to review their structure. Make clearer the guidelines on balancing the cost of changes with creating local identity for authorities. 'Opting in' could be presented as giving more autonomy to local authorities, and could speed the review's work. But divisions between districts and counties mean ministers' hopes that the commission's work can be accelerated seem forlorn. Districts fear that 'opting in' could be used to halt the review, particularly if a large proportion of local councils or voters have to agree. But the Association of County Councils is opposed to changes in the guidance. 'Opting in' would support its view that there is no need to change the status quo in many areas. Such an approach would be seen by Labour as deeply contentious. Since the commission was a Conservative manifesto commitment, the opposition is unlikely to be able to resist claiming another government U-turn if its review became voluntary. There is more common ground on other ideas to expedite the process, such as adjusting the guidance. Yesterday the review was criticised by the European Policy Forum, which said the commission's work should be redesigned, because the unitary principle would be achieved 'at too high a cost'.

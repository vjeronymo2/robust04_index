			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRYSDALE DOESN'T LIKE UMPIRES BEING HANDY  </P> <P> I found it hard to believe that Don Drysdale, with years of baseball  experience, would make the remark that he has always questioned the right of an  umpire to put his hands on a ballplayer to prevent a scuffle, inasmuch as a  player does not have the right to bodily contact the umpire. Surely Drysdale  should be aware of the difference -- the umpire is expected to maintain order  on the field and if necessary to do so must restrain the player.  </P> <P> And in Drysdale's interview with an umpire after the game, he made a remark  about the umps turning the game over to the players.  </P> <P> I never thought I would miss Ross Porter on TV, but I do.  </P> <P> HERB HEATH, Camarillo  </P></p>

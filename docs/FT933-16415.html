			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Australia is lifted by rise in gold stocks RUMOURS that a new stock futures contract based on a 350 issue price index will replace the Nikkei 225 futures in November prompted a fall in the futures markets and share prices lost ground on arbitrage selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average gave up 303.15, or 1.5 per cent, to 19,621.46, barely changed on the week. The index hit the day's high of 19,932.19 just after the opening, but soon lost ground, falling to the day's low of 19,561.06 during the afternoon session. Volume remained below 300m shares for the eighth consecutive day at 230m shares against 231m. Declines led advances by 685 to 286 with 183 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 12.00 to 1,586.03 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 3.25 to 1201.59. Insolvency at Nikkatsu had already been discounted into share prices, said traders, and had little effect on the market. The movie producer and distributor, which filed for court protection under the bankruptcy law on Thursday, was transferred to the liquidation post yesterday, ahead of its delisting in October. Nikkatsu, a component stock of the Nikkei 225 ,will be replaced by Shionogi, the pharmaceutical company. Nikkatsu came under heavy selling pressure yesterday, and closed at an offered price of Y149. Shionogi gained strongly on heavy buying, closing up Y65 to Y1,050 in active volume. Rohm, the integrated circuit maker, which announced on Wednesday that its US subsidiary had won a patent for flash memory chips, once again failed to trade and closed at a bid price of Y3,210. Broadcasting companies were higher on reports that Fuji Television Network, a leading television and radio network, was planning to list its shares. Tokyo Broadcasting System rose Y20 to Y1,410 and Nippon Television Network gained Y100 to Y19,200. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 155.89 to 21,763.23 in volume of 14.1m shares. Roundup THE rise in the price of bullion provided an impetus to some of the region's markets yesterday. AUSTRALIA moved higher on buying of gold stocks after a sharp increase in the bullion price. The gold index advanced 143 to a new five-and-a-half-year record of 2,104.0 while the All Ordinaries index improved 13.6 to 1,768.9, up 4 per cent on the week. Turnover was strong at Dollars 438.5m. Among gold stocks, Newcrest Mining surged 45 cents to ADollars 4.75 and Plutonic 30 cents to ADollars 6.40. Commonwealth Bank rose 6 cents to ADollars 8.76 ahead of the government's announcement after the close that it will bring forward the sale of a 19 per cent stake. HONG KONG was divided over how to interpret talks between Mr Chris Patten, the governor, and the UK government which took place in London on Thursday. The Hang Seng index put on 12.55 to 7,217.93, a week's gain of 2.9 per cent. Turnover was HKDollars 4.7bn. News that Mr Zhu Rongji, the Chinese vice-premier, had taken on the additional post of governor of China's Central Bank came after the market closed. Some analysts commented that the appointment could mean that China will move to control the sharp growth in bank credit. NEW ZEALAND rose to its highest level since May 1990 in hectic post-budget trading. The NZSE-40 index closed up 12.58 at 1,699.07, a week's rise of 2.6 per cent. Turnover was a strong NZDollars 60.4m. Brokers noted that the rally had been driven by lower domestic interest rates and the fact that no tax changes were proposed in the budget. Fletcher Challenge gained 6 cents to NZDollars 2.92. BANGKOK was stronger on interest in speculative issues. The SET index rose 10.40 to 887.92, down 1 per cent on the week. Turnover was Bt6.95bn.</p>

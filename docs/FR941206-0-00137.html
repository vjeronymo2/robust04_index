			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The applicability of the subpart CC standards has been revised since proposal to specifically exempt from the rule certain tanks surface impoundments, and containers in which the owner or operator has stopped adding hazardous waste. The subpart CC standards do not apply to a tank, surface impoundment, or container that meets either of the following conditions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) No hazardous waste is added to the waste management unit on or after June 5, 1995 (see generally 55 FR 39409, September 27, 1990); or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Addition to hazardous waste to the waste management unit is stopped and the owner or operator has begun implementing or completed closure pursuant to an approved closure plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the applicability of the subpart CC standards has been changed such that the rule is not applicable to any container having a design capacity less than 0.1 m3 (approximately 26 gallons) regardless of the organic content of the hazardous waste handled in the container. In response to comments on the proposed rule, the EPA reviewed the types of small containers commonly used to accumulate and transfer hazardous waste. Considering the small quantity of hazardous waste handled in a sample collection vial, safety can, disposal can, and other types of small containers and the short periods of time that the waste normally remains in one of these containers, the EPA concluded that existing rules for containers having a design capacity less than 0.1 m3 are sufficient to protect human health and the environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the EPA has decided to temporarily defer application of the subpart CC standards to tanks, surface impoundments, and containers managing hazardous wastes under certain special circumstances. For now, the EPA is deferring application of the subpart CC standards to waste management units that are used solely to treat or store hazardous wastes generated on-site from remedial activities required under RCRA corrective action or CERCLA response authorities (or similar State remediation authorities). Also, the EPA is deferring application of the subpart CC standards to waste management units that are used solely to manage radioactive mixed wastes. The EPA's rationale for these deferrals is explained in section VIII.A.1 of this preamble. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. General Standards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For each tank, surface impoundment, or container to which the subpart CC standards apply (referred to here as an ``affected unit''), the owner or operator is required to use the air emission controls specified in the rule except when the hazardous waste placed in an affected unit meets certain conditions. As explained in the following paragraphs, the conditions under which an affected unit is exempted from the air emission control requirements of the subpart CC standards have been revised since proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Waste volatile organic concentration exemption. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under the final subpart CC standards, an affected unit is exempt from the air emission control requirements of the rule if all hazardous waste placed in the unit is determined to have an average volatile organic concentration less than 100 parts per million by weight (ppmw) based on the organic composition of the hazardous waste at the point of waste origination. This waste volatile organic concentration limit incorporates several revisions that have been made by the EPA since proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, the format for the limit has been changed to be the average volatile organic concentration of the hazardous waste on a mass-weighted basis during normal operating conditions for the source or process generating the waste (in contrast to the proposed format of the maximum volatile organic concentration for the hazardous waste never to be exceeded). Averaging periods up to 1 year in duration are allowed for each individual waste stream under the final rule. The procedures for determining the average volatile organic concentration of a waste are explained further under ``Waste Determination Procedures'' in this section and in section VII.A.3 of this preamble. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Mar 23 (ANTARA) -- The North Korean  Government expressed gratitude to Indonesia for its positive  stand regarding its row on nuclear issue with the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    "We express gratitude to the Indonesian Government whose  positive attitude towards our stand on the nuclear issue gives  us some support," North Korean Ambassador to Indonesia Han  Pong-ha said at a press conference here on Wednesday.    Han was responding to President Suharto's recent statement  urging North Korea's conflict with IAEA, particugarly the United  States, to be settled in a peaceful way.    According to the North Korean ambassador, Indonesia, being  the chairman of the Non-aligned Movement, has shown  encouragement in defending the interests of developing countries.    He appreciated Indonesia's opposition towards IAEA's plan to  bring the North Korean nuclear issue to the United Nations  Security Council for its settlement.    Indonesia rejects the idea on the grounds that the issue  should be settled in a dialogue between the country involved and  the IAEA, Ambassador Han said.    The conflict between North Korea and IAEA, particularly with  the United States, began when North Korea rejected earlier the  nuclear international body's inspection team to observe its  nuclear facilities.    North Korea withdrew its Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)  membership on March 1993 but later deferred the withdrawal after  conducting talks with the United States.    Han threatened that his country will withdraw its NPT  membership if the United States continues to break the agreement  signed by both sides in New York last February 25, 1994.    According to Han, under the agreement, the United States,  announced the suspension of the "Team Spirit '94" -- a joint  military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea -- and that  it would set a date of the opening of third round of North  Korea-U.S. talks.    "However, the United States said it would keep the promise  only after the inspection of IAEA had been made satisfactory and  special envoys are exchanged between the North and the South,"  he added.    The ambassador also disclosed that the meeting agreed on  four  steps of simultaneous action for a package solution to the  nuclear issue, including the suspension of the "Team Spirit  '94", resumption of the working level meetings, acceptance of  the IAEA inspection and holding of the third round of U.S.-North  Korea talk.    The ambassador said that North Korea has accepted the IAEA's  inspectors. It has held several rounds of working level  meetings and made every possible efforts for an early exchange  of special envoys.    "But the U.S. side has fulfilled none of its obligations,"  he  said, adding that, "if the U.S. continues to break the  agreement we will withdraw our NPT membership."</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Energy Policy Act of 1992 established the United States Enrichment Corporation as a new Government corporation which generally has responsibility for enriched uranium production at the Portsmouth and Paducah plants, as well as United States marketing rights for enriched uranium produced or blended at those plants. The United States Enrichment Corporation is leasing the plants from the Department of Energy, has signed an agreement for division of responsibilities between the Department and the Corporation at the two plants, and assumed responsibility for enriched uranium production on July 1, 1993. All depleted UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  created beginning July 1, 1993, is the responsibility of the Corporation. Consequently, the proposed Department strategy for depleted UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  management does not include material created after July 1, 1993; however, the Department's decisions on depleted UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  disposition could affect the Corporation's operating plans and policies. The environmental impact statement will include a discussion of the likely impacts of any of the Department's decisions on the Corporation, but cannot commit to a course of action for material controlled by the Corporation without prior agreement. Public comment on the scope of possible actions and agreements is welcome.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A major consequence of the gaseous diffusion process is the accumulation of a significant amount of depleted UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Most of this material is stored at the Paducah and Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plants and at the Oak Ridge Reservation. The total amount of depleted UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  stored at these three sites is approximately 560,000 metric tons. Depleted UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is stored in large steel cylinders holding approximately 14 tons each, stacked two layers high, in large ``yards'' at the sites. The cylinders are inspected regularly to detect and repair any leaks should they occur. About 29,000 cylinders are stored at Paducah, 13,000 at Portsmouth, and 5,000 at Oak Ridge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Potential uses of depleted UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and its chemical constituents include: (1) use of uranium metal in armament manufacture or as metal or oxide-based shielding in the management of radioactive materials, including wastes or spent nuclear fuel; and (2) use of hydrogen fluoride, hydrofluoric acid, and fluorine for commercial industrial processes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose of the Environmental Impact Statement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the environmental impact statement is to evaluate the impacts of alternative strategies for the long-term management and use of depleted UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  stored at the Paducah, Portsmouth, and Oak Ridge sites. Such alternatives would be analyzed for their impacts on the human environment, including risks to public health and safety, occupational health and safety, and effects upon the natural environment. The need for the proposed action arises from changes in various domestic and international factors. These factors include: the changed mission and functions of the Department of Energy programs for nuclear materials production and research; changes brought about by the end of the Cold War; the shift in emphasis mandated by the President's budget requests; and by directives of the Secretary of Energy to reconsider future Department missions, functions, and responsibilities. The unique properties and value of depleted UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , as well as the large volumes in storage, suggest that the evaluation, analysis, and decisions on the fate of this material be made separate from those of other materials in storage or awaiting disposition. The Department has determined that such an action is a major Federal action with potentially significant environmental impacts and requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement in accordance with NEPA. This environmental impact statement will aid in making management decisions on depleted UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by evaluating the environmental impacts of a range of reasonable alternatives, as well as providing a means for a public voice in the decision-making process. The Department is committed to ensuring that the public has a full and complete opportunity to be heard on this matter and is providing this advance notice of intent to that end.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Preliminary Description of Alternatives for Environmental Impact Statement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of Energy requests public input on all relevant aspects of the long-term management and use of depleted UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and potential alternatives. At this time, the Department has no preferred alternative and will consider for inclusion in the environmental impact statement all reasonable alternatives. The following is a discussion about the preliminary list of alternatives for the environmental impact statement that may be modified by additions or deletions; public comment on the range of alternatives is hereby requested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Half way for BP BP's decision to cut costs and its dividend has the feel of necessary but insufficient action. With cash draining from the business at an alarming rate, the board was left with little option. However, the measures announced yesterday will do little more than return cash flow to an even keel next year once the savings from redundancies come through. Any repayment of debt will have to come from asset sales. Those will be very hard to come by, despite BP's good track record in auctioning unwanted companies. The most likely candidates for disposal are in refining and chemicals. With downstream profits under severe pressure, finding buyers, even at fire sale prices, will not be easy, as Lasmo's experience demonstrates. Shell's results show how even financially strong oil companies are suffering. When it comes to deals, the weak can expect no quarter. That leaves very little room for dividend growth to resume from the low base established yesterday. BP's yield is now below that of Shell, reversing the pattern of the 1980s. This makes the share price vulnerable, to say the least. True, American investors have been buying BP because the shares look better value than some domestic producers. But UK institutions are more likely to focus on the relative attractions of Shell. The joker in the pack is the oil price. Any substantial rise in crude, or upturn in the world economy, would bail BP out nicely. That, however, seems a remote possibility. While they wait for their shrunken dividend cheques, shareholders might also ruefully reflect that the man now at the helm, Mr David Simon, was intimately involved in the decision to buy the assets which caused all the trouble.</p>

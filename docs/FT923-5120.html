			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / 'Yes' campaign gaining ground, polls indicate TWO opinion polls yesterday forecast that France would narrowly approve the Maastricht treaty on European union at a referendum this month, as European leaders rallied to support President Francois Mitterrand in his campaign for a 'Yes' vote. Mr Mitterrand, who will tonight take part in his first television debate in four years, has been under growing pressure since opinion polls began to show a majority against the treaty a week ago. Other European leaders, with their own agendas at stake, have begun adding their weight to the 'Yes' campaign. Spanish prime minister Felipe Gonzalez told a rally in Strasbourg last night that Europe must overcome the nationalist drive that unleashed two world wars. German chancellor Helmut Kohl is to make a satellite appearance tonight on French television. The debate between the Socialist president and Mr Philippe Seguin, the most prominent neo-Gaullist opponent of the treaty, will set the tone in the final stage of the referendum campaign, which is balanced on a knife-edge margin between the 'Yes' and 'No' camps. Two polls published yesterday showed a shift in sentiment indicating a small majority for 'Yes'. The BVA/Paris Match poll suggested that 51 per cent of the electorate would support ratification. The same poll last week indicated that exactly the same proportion would vote 'No'. An IPSOS/Le Point poll suggested a 53 per cent majority in favour, against last week's poll which suggested the 'Yes' faction would lose with just 48 per cent. Yesterday's polls support the general trend of this week's surveys, which show growing support for the treaty, although still by a slim margin. Tonight's debate will offer a chance for Mr Mitterrand to salvage his political credibility at a time when his future has been called into question. The anti-Maastricht camp has been trying to turn the referendum into a vote of no confidence in him and the Socialist government. The BVA/Paris Match poll yesterday showed that the president's approval rating has fallen from 35 per cent to 33 per cent in the past month. This means Mr Mitterrand is uncomfortably close to his all-time popularity poll low of 31 per cent on the eve of this spring's regional elections. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the Socialist prime minister whose appointment after the regional elections briefly boosted the president's poll standing, has seen his approval rating fall from 41 per cent to 35 per cent since July. The constitutional court yesterday rejected an appeal by conservative opponents of the treaty, who had been trying to block ratification on constitutional grounds. The French stock market, which was depressed last week by the threat of a negative referendum result, recovered momentum yesterday. The CAC 40 Index ended the day 1.57 per cent higher at 1,700,50.

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / International Company News: Eastman Kodak expects 'difficult' first quarter EASTMAN Kodak, the US photographics group, said it did not expect a recovery in business during the first quarter of this year, Reuter reports from New York. In the annual report, Mr Kay Whitmore, company chairman, said the first quarter 'will be a difficult one for the company'. He said any improvement in the US economy and in Europe would not be perceptible until the second half of 1992. The company said sales in its imaging division during January and February were slightly lower than in the comparable period a year ago. Sales in the information division were down on last year while those in chemicals were level with those posted in the early months of last year. In the health division, good sales gains had been recorded, the company said. For the year as a whole, Kodak said it saw 'moderately higher sales and good gains' in earnings. Mr Whitmore said that recovery in the company results would be more gradual than abrupt. 'Beyond this year, recovery in our business results should be more pronounced,' he said, with rates of return 'superior to those of our peers'. Kodak recently announced a new group of improved Kodak Gold Plus colour negative film for consumers, and plans to launch a new Photo CD system this summer.</p>

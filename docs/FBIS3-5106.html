U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will come to  Tokyo  next week to mend the strained bilateral ties or put further  pressure on Japan to open its markets further.    Christopher's Tokyo visit follows President Bill Clinton's  signing of an executive order to reinstate the super 301  provision of a 1988 trade law giving the President the authority  to retaliate against countries deemed to be engaging in unfair  trade practices.    Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, responding  immediately to the U.S. action, called it "unilateral" and urged  Washington to exercise care in applying super 301.    "Japan wants to resolve the case multilaterally rather than  bilaterally," said Hata, suggesting Japanese readiness to bring  the case to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    Christopher will arrive in Tokyo on Wednesday as part of a  four- nation tour of Asia and Australia. He will meet Hosokawa,  Hata and other Japanese leaders during his three-day stay.    According to a senior State Department official, Christopher  will discuss trade issues with Japanese leaders and warn Japan  of a potential fallout beyond economics.    The secretary of state will play largely a listening role  and  has no plan to make any U.S. proposal on how to resolve trade  disputes with Japan, Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord  said.    Lord said the economic problems afflicting Japan and the  U.S.  "are very serious" and added they could spill over to other  aspects of the bilateral relationship if left unattended.    Clinton, ignoring a Japanese plea, took the super 301 action  after his talks with Hosokawa in Washington last month on a new  trade framework for the two countries collapsed.    The U.S.-proposed framework is aimed at opening Japan's  markets and reducing its huge trade surplus with the United  States by setting specific targets.    The failure of the talks has drastically reduced the number  of Japanese who think Japan-U.S. relations are good.    An ASAHI SHIMBUN newspaper poll released this week said  pollees who consider bilateral ties to be good plunged to a  record low of 20 percent, down from 37 percent two months  earlier.    Those who do not consider relations to be good increased  from  42 percent to 64 percent, the poll found.    Hosokawa will appear in the Diet for three days from Monday  to reply to questions from ruling and opposition legislators on  his administrative policy speech delivered this week.    His political leadership was badly damaged this week as he  failed to shake up his seven-month-old cabinet -- an action  aimed chiefly at dumping Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura.    Political commentators said Hosokawa wanted to get rid of  Takemura because of growing differences in political outlook  between the two, both former prefectural governors whose  relationship was once described as close.    The abortive attempt has left a serious scar and split in  Hosokawa's seven-party coalition between those supporting the  prime minister and those backing Takemura.    Cambodian Prime Ministers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun  Sen are scheduled to visit Tokyo from Wednesday through Saturday  to attend an International Conference on Cambodian  Reconstruction in which the U.S. Secretary of State will also  take part.    The International Committee on Reconstruction of Cambodia  will be held on Thursday and Friday with the participation of 3l  countries and the European Union as well as l2 international  organizations, including the World Bank and the International  Monetary Fund.    Meetings of the Cambodian premiers with Hosokawa and Hata  are  also scheduled, and official Japanese sources said Japan will  offer Cambodia some 9 billion yen in grant aid for fiscal 1994.    Other foreign dignitaries visiting Japan next week include  Xiao Rong, the third daughter of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.    Xiao, who often accompanies her father, will stay in Japan  from Monday to Saturday in connection with a book she wrote  about her father's life. The book was recently translated into  Japanese.    She is a vice president of the China Association for  International Friendly Contacts and a member of the National  People's Congress, China's parliament.    Other events next week include a seminar Japan will host  from  Monday to Friday for 12 former Soviet republics on its measures  on arms control, disarmament and nonproliferation.    It will be the first gathering including all 12 former  Soviet  republics to discuss controls on the export of technology with  military application.    The seminar is designed to help the 12 establish an  effective  export control system to strengthen the nonproliferation of arms.    On the economic front, the Economic Planning Agency will  release a monthly economic report Tuesday.</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: McCain family's public feud intensifies The McCain family is again fighting in public over the future of its Canadian-based frozen foods group, McCain Foods. Earlier this year a New Brunswick judge tried in vain to mediate in the feud between Mr Harrison McCain, 66, and his brother Mr Wallace McCain, 64, co-chief executives and architects of the company's 35-year growth. The shareholders, comprising 30 family members, were to vote on September 13 on a board resolution ousting Mr Wallace McCain. At issue is which branch of the family will eventually assume company leadership. Last week Mr Wallace McCain's sons Michael and Scott, both company directors, went to court to have the resolution overturned. They argued it violated company by-laws and any such change would require a two-thirds boardroom majority. They claimed the Wallace McCain family had been 'excluded from full and meaningful participation in McCain Foods affairs'. Mr Harrison McCain replied swiftly. In a public statement he said the succession issue and whether to take the company public and appoint an outsider as chief executive - as suggested by the judge last summer - should be decided only by the shareholders. 'There is no magic and if shareholders representing a majority of the company's stock want a new chief executive, they will have one,' he said. 'In the McCain family, the shareholders must rule and the will of the majority must be respected.' Mr Andrew McCain, chairman, said the board would fight the lawsuit launched by Mr Wallace McCain's sons but would go ahead with the September 13 directors' meeting.</p>

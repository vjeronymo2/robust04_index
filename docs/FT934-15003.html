			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Left-wing parties form coalition in Poland TWO of Poland's parties with their roots in the communist past said yesterday they intended to form a coalition government following elections on September 19 which failed to produce an outright winner. The Left Democratic Alliance (SLD) and the Polish Peasant Party (PSL) signed a joint statement of their intention yesterday. Together they won 35 per cent of the vote and control 303 seats in the 460-member parliament. They have also proposed Mr Waldemar Pawlak, a 34-year-old farmer and PSL leader, for prime minister. The SLD leader, Mr Aleksander Kwasniewski, said: 'We want a government which will support a strong market economy but which will respect social rights.' He will not join the government but will lead the group's parliamentary caucus. Mr Pawlak and President Lech Walesa met for an hour yesterday evening but issued no statement, a reflection of Mr Walesa's unhappiness with the prospect of a left-leaning government. He is insisting that the SLD, which won the biggest share of seats in the election, should give him three names from which to choose a premier. If he fails to appoint a head of government within two weeks after the first meeting of the lower house, parliament can nominate a prime minister without consulting him. Yesterday, the coalition, in a conciliatory gesture to Mr Walesa, withdrew a proposal to transfer presidential powers over the security services to the government and parliament. This, and the coalition's refusal to accept a reduction in Poland's mass privatisation scheme, caused the Solidarity-rooted Labour Union to withdraw from coalition talks. Mass privatisation, a plan backed by the World Bank, will place the ownership of around 600 state-sector companies with foreign-managed national investment funds and sell the shares in those funds to Poles at a nominal charge.</p>

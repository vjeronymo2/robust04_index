			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Randcoal rises on higher sales of coal and weaker rand HIGHER local and export coal sales and a weaker rand boosted profits at Randcoal, the coal arm of the Rand Mines group, in the six months to end-March. The higher volumes and weaker rand caused turnover to rise by 35 per cent to R766.1m (Dollars 266.9m) while operating profit was 55 per cent higher at R164.8m. Net income more than doubled to R97.1m from R42.2m, but the increased number of shares in issue limited earnings per share growth to 44 per cent, up to 95 cents from 66 cents a share. Mr Allen Cook, chief executive of Randcoal - formerly Witbank Collieries - said 6 cents per share of earnings was due to the first contributions to Randcoal's earnings from Corgroup Investments and Manhattan Syndicate which were acquired last year. Export sales rose 21 per cent to 5.04m tonnes, inland sales were 20 per cent up at 1.63m tonnes and sales to Escom 23 per cent higher at 7.4m tonnes. The overall sales increase of 21.6 per cent mainly reflects the first-time contributions of Corgroup and higher volumes from Douglas Colliery and Welgedacht Exploration. Mr Cook said that the inland market continued to weaken and that sales would have fallen had the company not sold coal to a partner for export. He added that there had been a substantial weakening in the spot price of export steam coal since the beginning of the year. The company's exposure to this was, however, limited as much of its long-term business had already been concluded. Earnings for the second half of the year are expected to be in line with those for the first six months.</p>

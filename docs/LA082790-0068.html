			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOSCOW MUSEUM GETS REAL;  </P> <P> ART: 'THE WAY TO POLITICAL PLURALISM' AT THE MUSEUM OF THE REVOLUTION, ONCE A  SHRINE TO THE BOLSHEVIKS, REVELS IN TALKING ABOUT ONCE-FORBIDDEN SUBJECTS.  </P> <P> Banners proclaiming "Down With the Communist Party" and "Market Economy -- Yes"  now line museum walls long reserved for propaganda about the victory of  Marxist-Leninist ideals in the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution.  </P> <P> A new exhibit, "The Way to Political Pluralism," is on view in the Museum of  the Revolution, which until recently had been the showcase for the Soviet  leader of the day to force his ideas on the children who filed through by the  thousands on school trips.  </P> <P> Topics now on display include the political life of scientist and human rights  campaigner Andrei D. Sakharov, the refugees from ethnic strife across the  country, the fast-growing environmental movement and the drives for  independence in the Baltic republics.  </P> <P> "There is a very stormy political life in our country right now," said Svetlana  V. Lifanova, 45, the historian in charge of exhibit. "Many people do not have  clear ideas of the political forces battling for power.  </P> <P> "We hoped to show them the stormy political life and give people an opportunity  to compare different political platforms and ideas."  </P> <P> Although many of the materials on display here could have brought their owners  seven years in prison for anti-Soviet propaganda not long ago, Lifanova said  the Museum of the Revolution is the obvious place for such an exhibition today.  </P> <P> "Soviet President (Mikhail S.) Gorbachev calls this a revolution -- although it  is a peaceful revolution," she said. "There really is a revolution going on,  especially in the consciousness of the people."  </P> <P> But for museum-goers, such political heresy in a setting that was once a shrine  to the Bolsheviks, their revolution and their party is hugely ironic.  </P> <P> "It's very funny for a Soviet person to see this," said Masha M. Voltenstein, a  physicist, "because we are used to things in museums having absolutely no  connection with reality."  </P> <P> Items on display ranged from the flag of Pamyat, a Russian nationalist group  with anti-Semitic leanings, to ration coupons for sugar and a telegram to the  liberal Inter-Regional Group of Deputies to the national parliament.  </P> <P> "The people are behind you. Down with the 6th Article. Create a party," the  telegram read. Delivered at the Kremlin, the telegram was sent by a Muscovite  to encourage the liberal legislators to delete from the constitution the  article guaranteeing the Communist Party's leading role in the life of the  country.  </P> <P> Once-banned flags, anti-Communist newspapers, platforms of new political  parties and photographs of the most controversial recent events filled the  exhibit, which is scheduled to remain in place for at least four more months.  </P> <P> The exhibit is so up-to-date that it even has materials from July's 28th party  congress, including a political cartoon lampooning the battle between  conservatives and liberals.  </P> <P> In the cartoon, discredited Soviet leaders Josef Stalin and Leonid I. Brezhnev  are standing in front of the Kremlin's Palace of Congresses. Stalin whispers to  Brezhnev, "Our guys still aren't surrendering," in an obvious illusion to the  hard-liners' stubborn refusal to give up power.  </P> <P> The preparation of the exhibit itself shows how much change there has been  since 1987, when the museum was still a custodian of the official line on the  past and curators were prevented from getting their hands on archival material  such as documents about Stalin's victims.  </P> <P> "At last, we don't have to hide anything," said Lifanova, who has worked at the  museum for 21 years. "Before, history was seen through the prism of party  ideology. This is the historic truth we have always dreamed about."  </P> <P> For the exhibit on political pluralism, a group of museum historians gathered  authentic materials of the current political scene. Banners used in recent  demonstrations are on display. Ration coupons were collected from around the  country. Some of the photographs of the recent ethnic clashes were taken by  local residents.  </P> <P> One banner is at the expense of former leader Nikita S. Khrushchev, who often  boasted that the Soviet Union would excel in every imaginable category, both  important and mundane. The banner reads, "We will catch up and overtake America  in the quantity of milk and will catch up with and overtake America in the  quantity of political parties."  </P> <P> The Soviet Union has already achieved that goal: More than 20 new political  parties and organizations were represented at the exhibit alone.  </P> <P> Visitors were visibly affected as they viewed the roll-call vote that spelled  the end of the Communist Party's monopoly, notes legislators had scrawled to  themselves and casual photographs of popular heroes.  </P> <P> "This is really unusual," Igor A. Sviridov, 54, an unemployed metalworker, said  while viewing material on the Ukrainian independence movement. "It's the first  time I've seen many of these things.  </P> <P> "If Lenin were here, he would call Lubyanka and have this closed down and all  those involved thrown in jail," Sviridov said, using the slang name for the  offices of the KGB, the Soviet security police.  </P></p>

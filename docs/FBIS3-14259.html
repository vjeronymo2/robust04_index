Several local and international organizations have expressed  willingness to mediate in the issue. Even the two parties  involved in the conflict have expressed their inclination for  peace. Nevertheless, what are the factors that hinder these  peace efforts from making any headway? Today, it is clear that  the primary reason for this is lack of a clear-cut policy with  the government in adopting suitable measures to resolve the  ethnic conflict.    The ideas expressed by the president in general meetings on  the ethnic conflict are totally contrary to those of the prime  minister. Apart from this, the views expressed by the ministers  also differ.in Three points stated by President D.B. Wijetunge  recently on the minorities issue have drawn our attention. He  says: There is nothing like ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka, but it  is only the menace of terrorism that exists in the country.  Only the majority community people should rule the country  forever and the minority should depend on them. There is no  traditional territory for Tamils in Sri Lanka. The president's  views on the ethnic conflict have been reflected in these  statements.    At the same time, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe has  adopted a different approach to the ethnic conflict. He  projects himself as a person who believes in negotiations to  find a solution to the conflict. It is ludicrous to note that  his invitations to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam [LTTE]  for talks carry different conditions on different occasions.  Thus, besides differing from the views of the president, he  contradicts his own statements.    Third, ministers have been expressing their own views,  either  in favor of or against those of the president and the prime  minister. The official position of the government should be a  combination of all these views, but one can come across only  contradictions here. In other words, their views indicate that  the government does not have any specific or authenticated stand  on the ethnic issue. While taking steps to resolve the ethnic  conflict, it is imperative to form a specific and coordinated  view, at least at the ministerial level.    When the government does not have a specific and unified  stand on the ethnic conflict, the Sinhalese politicians are  offering various kinds of false propaganda on the minorities  issue. This further aggravates the situation in resolving the  issue. As the Sinhalese are given a wrong impression about the  Tamils and their demands, it amplifies the feeling of animosity  and creates a situation which makes it difficult to find a  solution.    Given this situation, the government resorts to military  action to suppress the legitimate aspirations of the minorities.  All the military actions taken by the government in the past  one and a half decades have ended in farce, only leading to the  destruction of the property of the government and the people.  However, these military actions could not destroy the  legitimate aspirations of the people. Today's events indicate  that these aspirations cannot be wiped out by mere military  operations.    The Tamil community in the north has adapted itself to live  amid any kind of threat. Normal activities are being carried  out there despite heavy bombardment and shelling. People are  used to living amid major economic embargo and transport  barriers. In Kilaly, boat service is continuing despite air and  missile attacks. All these things indicate that the Tamils are  not going to submit to any kind of military pressure.    At the same time, the perpetual military pressure and the  conflict have brought major changes to the social fabric of the  Northern Tamils. Once Mahatma Gandhi said: The day when a woman  is able to walk all alone in the streets at midnight can be  regarded as the day of absolute freedom. A volunteer from a  service organization who visited Jaffna recently has said that  such a situation exists only in Jaffna. He has also pointed out  that the crisis situation which existed before 1985 or from  1987-90 has changed, and that a peaceful atmosphere prevails  there now.    All these things indicate that the struggle of the Tamil  people has reached a stage where it is impossible to satisfy the  legitimate aspirations of the people with inconsistent  solutions. At the same time, this issue has gained  international recognition. Human rights and refugee welfare  organizations have also started showing interest in this issue.  The government will have to face an embarrassing situation in  dealing with the pressures being exerted by them. Because, the  norms like fundamental rights, human rights, and the right to  self-determination have gained international acclaim.  Acknowledging these norms will be quite unpleasant for the Sri  Lankan Government. Therefore, the government would prefer to  resolve the issue at home itself rather than taking it to the  international level.    Today, everyone understands the need for holding talks with  the LTTE to resolve the issue. The LTTE theoretician Anton  Balasingham has already stated that the organization is ready  for unconditional talks with the government. Although the  government side speaks of holding talks, this is only lip  service. Ranil Wickremasinghe, who outlined various  preconditions on different occasions, says that the response  should come from Prabhakaran himself and that he should also  participate in the talks. Anton Balasingham and Karikalan would  not have given their personal views to the journalists and  representatives of peace missions who visited Jaffna. They  would not have said anything without the permission of  Prabhakaran. Therefore, the condition insisting on Prabhakaran's  direct participation does not seem to mean anything.    Asking a guerrilla organization to lay down its arms first  and then come to the negotiating table is unprecedented. Past  experiences also will not help create such a situation. For  instance, even during the presence of the Indian peacekeeping  force, the government started installing Sinhalase settlements  in violation of the accord and delayed the establishment of  interim government [as published]. Therefore, all Tamils feel  that it will be suicidal to lay down arms while trusting the  government, which is in the clutches of the Sinhalese racists.    Hence, the process of talks cannot be initiated all of a  sudden. It can be initiated gradually and stage by stage. To  achieve this, good diplomatic skill and political will to solve  the problem is imperative. Those who possessed diplomatic skill  and political will were only able to resolve major global  issues. But, as far as Sri Lanka is concerned, is there anyone  with such qualities?    First of all, the government should admit that there is  ethnic conflict in the country. Second, the government should  realize that this conflict needs a solution and that it should  take appropriate steps to achieve this. Mere invitations for  talks will not be the right initiative to find a solution. In  the past, the government succeeded in hoodwinking Tamil leaders  by holding several negotiations with them. Perhaps the reason  for the government's hesitation to hold negotiations now may be  that it cannot dupe the Tamil leadership any more.</p>

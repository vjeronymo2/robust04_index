			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Business Travel (Update): Hotel alliances The hotel industry will follow airlines in forming alliances to penetrate markets in which they are currently weak, according to Mr Michael Hirst, former chairman of Hilton International. Mr Hirst told a recent conference in New York that international hotel groups would find it difficult to expand in Asian markets by buying individual properties. Building new hotels would also be difficult. Developing a hotel from scratch required at least three years. Hotel groups would thus, he said, have to form alliances with strong regional companies.</p>

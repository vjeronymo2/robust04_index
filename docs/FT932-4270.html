			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Retirement-age women work longer than men ALMOST a quarter of women in Britain are working or looking for jobs up to five years after they have reached state pension age, compared with just 9 per cent of men, according to Department of Employment figures published today. Much of the difference between the sexes is accounted for by the gap in the state pension age - 60 for women and 65 for men. Just 4 per cent of women over the age of 65 are still working. The reason that women commonly continue working may be linked to the fact that far more retired men than women receive pensions. Separate government figures have shown that 69 per cent of retired men aged 65-69 were receiving an occupational pension in 1992, compared with 40 per cent of retired women aged 60-64. The report on the Labour Force Survey figures concludes that the 'decline in labour market participation of older people in Great Britain and in other European countries has slowed down, and, in the case of older women in Great Britain, has been reversed.' Since a similar survey in 1987, there has been an increase in economic activity among women aged 50-59 from 60 per cent to 62 per cent; for those aged 60-64, the figure has risen from 19 per cent to 23 per cent. Among men, there has been a fall since 1987 of those working aged 50-59 from 85 per cent to 84 per cent; the proportion of men aged 60-64 still working fell from 55 per cent to 53 per cent. All the latest Labour Force figures are for spring 1992. Older women are far more likely than men to be working part-time: 66 per cent of women aged 60-64 are part-time workers, compared to 14 per cent of men. Over the age of 65, 83 per cent of women still working are part-time, and 65 per cent of men are part-timers. Older workers, by Jennifer Dibden and Angelika Hibbett, Employment Gazette, June.

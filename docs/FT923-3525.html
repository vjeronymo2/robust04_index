			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Bout of face-saving strikes Ulster talks: The significance of the Democratic Unionists' walkout THE Democratic Unionist party reaffirmed yesterday that it would take no further part in talks on the future of Northern Ireland until the Irish government's constitutional claim over the province was on the negotiating table. The walkout comes as the talks reach a crucial point. After months of preparatory meetings and preliminary skirmishing, the core issues - the Irish Republic's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland and whether the unionists will accept some all-island dimension to an agreed solution - are about to be discussed at the talks. The DUP's withdrawal has cast a shadow over the entire talks process. A plenary session went ahead yesterday without the party. The Ulster Unionist party made clear that it would not be joining the DUP in withdrawing from the process, but would continue in discussions 'with the aim of forcing the Irish government to withdraw its legal claim to the territory of our part of the United Kingdom'. A meeting between the British and Irish governments is scheduled to take place in London today. The apparent impasse in the talks appears to have much to do with the art of face-saving. Any agreement will require concessions from the four political parties and the two governments involved, but all know that a concession made too soon, or too readily, might bring a backlash from their political constituencies, not to mention the paramilitaries, and maybe the end of a political career or two. The week after next, the talks are due to move from Stormont, the seat of government in Northern Ireland, to Dublin. It will be a symbolic moment, and one of great sensitivity for hardline unionists such as the Rev Ian Paisley, the DUP leader, who have consistently cold-shouldered their southern neighbours. Determination to maintain the confidential nature of the talks has caused difficulties with some rank-and-file unionists who feel they are not being kept sufficiently appraised of developments. Some DUP members resigned when Mr Paisley agreed to sit at the same table as Dublin ministers. So when the constitutional issue was placed fourth of a four-item agenda at this week's talks, the DUP apparently felt it was time to spell out more clearly its attitude to the Irish constitutional claim. The fact that Mr Paisley and his deputy, Mr Peter Robinson, left two delegates keeping their seats warm at the table - one of them Mr Paisley's daughter Rhonda - strengthens the view that the fuss may be little more than playing to the loyalist gallery. Once the item is reached on the agenda, the two leaders have hinted that they will be back at the table, but probably only if that point can be reached next week, before the talks move to Dublin. There is little indication yet that Dublin is prepared to meet Mr Paisley's demand on the constitutional issue without something in return from the unionists. The unionists have given no indication publicly or, it seems, within the negotiations, of what reciprocal step they might take. The Irish government insists that its territorial claim is up for negotiation, but also that 'nothing is agreed until everything is agreed'. To make unilateral concessions to the unionists before their arrival in Dublin would be very difficult politically. Few doubt that the Fianna Fail-led coalition would be able to deliver a constitutional change as long the unionists and the British government can make real concessions to protect the interests of the minority community in Northern Ireland. The constitutional change that Mr Paisley is seeking would seem to be within his reach, but he is also under pressure to reveal some of his own negotiating cards at the table. The art of face-saving requires that he does so without appearing to have done so.</p>

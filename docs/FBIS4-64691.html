			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Bjorn Lindahl report: "Carl I. Hagen's Party Splits"] </F>   [Text] Oslo -- Norway's Progress Party split yesterday.  Three of the party's Storting deputies left the party. Another  deputy had already gone his own way and the party deputy  chairman had already resigned.    This means that party leader Carl I. Hagen will have a  Storting group of only six deputies, while the four breakaways  will start to work together.    Compared with New Democracy in Sweden where the party's  founders disappeared and women took over, the reverse is the  case in Norway. Carl I. Hagen, who has been party leader for 16  years, has kicked the women and all the opposition to him out of  the party leadership. He is now being referred to as the "party  owner" in the Norwegian press and has returned to the populism  that characterized the party in the 1989 election when his party  become Norway's third largest and had 22 Storting deputies.    It was after this formidable success that Hagen believed  that  he could build up a more serious party. Young people who had  been attracted into the party because of the radical change it  represented enjoyed rapid careers. However, it turned out that  they had views that could not automatically be reconciled with  those of the older populists in the party: They were in favor  of free immigration, Norwegian EU [European Union] membership,  and the right for homosexuals to marry.    The conflict came to a head at the party congress in  mid-April. Deputy chairman Ellen Wibe resigned when Carl I.  Hagen proposed that the congress should not reach a decision on  Norwegian membership in the EU. However, it was Hagen who won  over the majority of delegates and who demanded blind obedience.    "The walls of the party closed in so much that they made it  very difficult to breathe. If we had not resigned voluntarily,  we would have been thrown out," said Ellen Christiansen, one of  the Storting deputies who has now quit the Progress Party, which  notched up 5 percent of voter sympathies in the most recent  opinion poll.</p>

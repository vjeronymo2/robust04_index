			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: A leaner business that has more bite / A look at Devro, the sausage skin maker which is coming to the market DEVRO International is not a company for the squeamish. This has nothing to do with its performance, which is very good, but rather with its main product - for Devro is one of the world's leading makers of edible sausage skins. Though the company will not acknowledge it, some people find the idea of sausage skins, or casings as the industry calls them, slightly repellent. If such people exist in the investment community their feelings may be tested in the next few weeks, for Devro is planning a flotation on the London Stock Exchange and may come to the market as early as June. Devro is a Scottish company which gained its independence in 1991 via a Pounds 108m management buy-out from Johnson &amp; Johnson, the US healthcare group. With two plants in Scotland and other factories in New Jersey, US, and New South Wales, Australia, it is headquartered in the tiny village of Moodiesburn near Glasgow. The flotation, which Charterhouse, Devro's merchant bankers, says carefully will occur sometime in the coming 12 months, is likely to create a company that 'will just creep into the bottom of the FT 350 index', suggesting a market capitalisation of between Pounds 170m and Pounds 180m. Yesterday Devro announced that it made an operating profit of Pounds 21.8m in the 12 months to December 1992 on turnover of Pounds 82.7m. That compared with an operating profit of Pounds 13.4m on sales of Pounds 53.4m for the 11 months to December 1991. After interest payments of Pounds 9.5m last year Devro made pre-tax profits of Pounds 12.8m against Pounds 6.3m. The global market for edible casings for sausages and other foods is worth about Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn). Devro claims to have 56 per cent of the market for larger casings made of collagen, a protein found in cow hides, whose discovery by medical researchers at Ethicon, the J&amp;J subsidiary, led to the creation of Devro in 1962. 'Devro was always a business apart within J&amp;J,' says Mr Frank De Angeli, Devro's chief executive. Although collagen was not a healthcare product, J&amp;J decided to launch collagen casings on the sausage market. The largest single share - about 30 per cent - of the world sausage casing market is still held by sheep and hog gut, which, Mr De Angeli admits 'may give you a better bite.' Collagen, he says, sells 'on the softness of our bite to the consumer.' Since the 1960s collagen casings have made big inroads into the sausage casing market in several countries, especially the UK, where they have a 75 per cent share. 'The gut market is in a state of gentle erosion worldwide', according to Mr De Angeli. Devro's sales volume has risen by 4 per cent a year over the past 11 years. The advantage of collagen over gut as a sausage casing is that it is produced in regular lengths and lends itself to being used with high speed machin-ery. But gut maintains a large share of the market in Germany and the US where consumers eat a different range of sausages to those in the UK. Devro has a very strong position in the UK sausage market, from which it derived about half its turnover in 1991, with 94 per cent of the collagen casings segment. It also has 40 per cent of the US collagen market and 83 per cent of the Australian market. It is trying to expand in France and Germany, and is developing in Japan and Korea. It also has only three effective competitors in collagen casings, Naturin in Germany, Nippi in Japan and Coria in the US. None has Devro's global marketing capabil-ity. According to research by NatWest Securities, Devro has enough manufacturing capacity to meet demand for the next four to five years, and more than 60 per cent of its costs are fixed, making for a very low marginal cost of production. Partly because Devro did not fit in with J&amp;J's other businesses several attempts were made by its management in the 1980s to buy it out. Eventually an MBO was achieved by Charterhouse which became the main institutional investor. Mr De Angeli, 67, a former main board director of J&amp;J who was not previously involved with Devro, put in money as an institutional investor as well as having a stake as a manager. The other contributors to the company's Pounds 30m of institutional equity include Baring Bros, Citicorp, Clydes dale Bank, County NatWest, Dunedin and Standard Life. The MBO, says Mr De Angeli who, despite his Italian name is British, has 'removed parochialism from Devro.' Under J&amp;J the company's four plants were were run as separate units, 'loosely co-ordinated by J&amp;J' Now there are single finance, marketing and research directors operating from Moodiesburn. 'Looking at it as one business has achieved our ambition of making it more efficient, though there's a lot more travel involved,' says Mr De Angeli. More than half of the company's 930 staff work at the Scottish plants at Moodiesburn and another at Bellshill, Lanarkshire. 'An MBO makes you more lean', Mr De Angeli says. 'You're always worried about the debt (Devro still has senior debt of Pounds 61m) and the covenants you have to keep to.' Very few people have asked me if they can hire more people. We've pulled our horns in and changed our travel policy - I've made a few trips across the Atlantic in economy class.' About 40 middle to junior ranking managers were made redundant last year. Devro engaged Charterhouse and brokers NatWest Wood Mackenzie in October to advise it on flotation. Mr De Angeli stepped down as chairman and was replaced by Mr Leon Allen, formerly chairman and chief executive of Del Monte Foods International. Mr De Angeli expects to lead the company through the flotation and says that he will stay 'as long as the board want me.'</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: French banks to lift property provisions FRENCH banks face another round of high provisions this year because of the precarious state of the property market, according to the Association Francaise des Banques. Mr Dominique Chatillon, chairman of the AFB, warned the French banks in a paper published yesterday that the provisions made for 1991 were 'insufficient' and that they were likely to have to make further substantial write-offs this year. The main problems, said Mr Chatillon, were the high rate of business failures - a situation that some observers suspect could be aggravated by the disruption caused by the current lorry drivers' dispute - and the weak state of the property sec-tor. France's property market, particularly in Paris, has been weak for the past two years. Mr Chatillon said there were signs of a 'very slight improvement' in the residential sector, but commercial property was still in the doldrums. The French banks are significant investors in the property sector and a number of them, notably Paribas, the investment banking group, were forced to make large provisions on property losses last year. The weak state of the property market is also expected to affect French insurance groups which have significant property holdings. At the same time, the banks are under pressure because of the competitive state of the domestic banking market, where margins are coming under pressure.</p>

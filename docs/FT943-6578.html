			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Fed deputy attacks European rate policies: Central banks criticised for not helping to boost jobs European central banks should cut interest rates to reduce unemployment, Mr Alan Blinder, the vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, urged at the weekend in a stinging attack on European monetary policy. At a conference of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Mr Blinder, appointed to the post by President Bill Clinton, singled out European central banks for criticism. 'The job of a central bank is to push the employment rate up to its natural level, but no further. By that criterion, the US is, I believe, extremely close to on target, and the European Union is, I believe, quite far from on target,' he said. Mr Blinder's remarks sparked a clash with Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the German Bundesbank. Mr Tietmeyer said: 'I regard the unemployment in western Germany as very largely being a structural problem. Monetary policy cannot be expected to make an active and direct contribution to a lasting reduction in unemployment.' Mr Blinder's new colleagues at the Fed also appeared uncomfortable with the implication of a less than single-minded devotion to the battle against inflation than has become a creed among central bankers. While arguing that central banks could do nothing to influence the unemployment rate over the long term, Mr Blinder maintained that the purpose of monetary policy should extend beyond the need to lower inflation. This position appeared to contradict remarks made by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, in a speech opening the conference, organised by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, on Friday. Although policymakers around the world agreed, said Mr Greenspan, that persistently high levels of unemployment were costly, 'any tendency to seek a bit of macro policy relief by pushing on the outer limits of monetary policy risks longer-term financial instability'. Mr Greenspan warned that the delay between a monetary policy change and its impact upon the economy was so long that attempts to forecast the economic consequences of interest rate changes were probably doomed to failure. International monetary offi-cials concurred that using unemployment as a target to guide interest rate policy was fraught with the danger of overheating the economy. Mr Blinder's remarks may confirm fears of some analysts who have worried that the Clinton administration might seek to tilt the Fed away from its hawkish line on inflation as seats on the Fed board fell vacant. However, any difference of opinion between the Clinton nominees and the Fed incumbents on the role of the central bank has not caused a rift over US monetary policy. Both Mr Blinder and Ms Janet Yellen, Mr Clinton's other appointment to the Fed, joined other members on August 16 in a unanimous vote to raise interest rates.

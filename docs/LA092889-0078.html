			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPTON SCHOOLS NEAR TEACHER QUOTA DESPITE TURNOVER, HIGHER ROLLS  </P> <P> Officials in the Compton Unified School District say they have filled all but  five teacher vacancies, despite enrollment figures that are running ahead of  previous years and despite the loss of 154 teachers who resigned to take jobs  elsewhere.  </P> <P> "At this point we are in excellent shape," said Thurman C. Johnson, assistant  superintendent in charge of personnel services.  </P> <P> However, Wiley Jones, director of the Compton Education Assn., said the union  is conducting its own survey this week to determine how many classes are being  taught by substitutes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Long-Term Substitutes  </P> <P> "We have teachers that have reported to us that there are still vacancies at  their schools. Some are being filled by day-to-day substitutes, some by  long-term subs," Jones said.  </P> <P> Johnson said long-term substitute teachers have been assigned to five  classrooms while the district continues to interview applicants until it finds  the most qualified people. Two elementary school classes, a middle school class  and two high school classes are being taught by substitutes, he said.  </P> <P> Almost 13% of the district's 1,185-member teaching staff resigned this year.  Three weeks before the start of school Sept. 11, district administrators still  had 70 teaching positions to fill.  </P> <P> The union attributed the resignations to low pay and poor working conditions.  Many of the departing teachers were drawn to jobs in the Los Angeles Unified  School District, where a teacher strike last spring resulted in a pay increase  that would give a veteran Compton teacher who switched to Los Angeles about  $10,000 more a year in salary.  </P> <P> Although their official count will not be taken until Oct. 6, Compton district  officials said student enrollment appears to be up over the last two years. On  the 10th day of school, for example, there were 25,891 students, up from 25,084  a year ago. Enrollment totaled 25,465 on the 10th day of school two years ago.  This year, enrollment has gone up steadily every day of school, officials said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'One of Best Efforts'  </P> <P> Jones said the classroom overcrowding feared by teachers has not occurred.  "It's one of the best efforts the district has ever made," Jones said of the  teacher recruiting and allocation. "The issue is, now can it hire the remaining  teachers it needs to cover the classrooms?"  </P> <P> Johnson says he believes the district will be able to hire the teachers. An  aggressive recruiting effort begun a few years ago by the district is beginning  to bear fruit, he said. "I feel better this year than I have in the past two  years because the quality of the people we're getting is a heck of a lot  better."  </P> <P> The district has advertised heavily across the country for teachers, especially  on college campuses. Like other districts in the area, it has also sent  representatives as far away as Spain, Canada and the Philippines to recruit  teachers.  </P> <P> The Compton district and its teacher union, however, have a turbulent labor  history. There was a bitter strike three years ago, and the teachers and the  district have been at an impasse for weeks over a new contract. The old  contract has expired.  </P> <P> Both sides met with a state mediator Tuesday but no progress was made, Jones  said, adding that the district asked for fact-finding. A three-member panel  will be formed to take testimony from district and teacher union  representatives about wages and the financial resources of the district. The  panel will decide which set of facts are closest to the truth. That process  could take from one to six months, meaning the teachers will continue to work  without a contract, Jones said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 21 Apr (XINHUA) -- At a news conference  this afternoon, Foreign Affairs Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin  answered reporters' questions on the report issued by the  Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons about  Sino-British relations, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua's forthcoming  trip to the United States, and Premier Li Peng's current trip to  four Central Asian countries.    A reporter asked: What is your comment on the report which  the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons  has published on Sino-British relations?    The spokesman replied: On 13 April the Foreign Affairs  Committee of the British House of Commons published a lengthy  report about Sino-British relations. The conclusion of this  report runs totally counter to its professed desire to develop  Sino-British relations.    Disregarding the facts, this report confuses right and wrong  and insists on supporting the erroneous policy of the British  Government on the Hong Kong issue and supporting its continual  confrontation with China, thus fully revealing the British  side's real intention of prolonging its colonial influence in  Hong Kong through creating chaos [zhi zao hun luan 0455 6644  3236 0052] there.    No forces whatsoever can stop the return of Hong Kong to the  motherland. The Chinese Government has the confidence and the  ability to resume exercising sovereignty over Hong Kong as  scheduled, carry out the policy for "one country, two systems,"  implement the basic law, and maintain Hong Kong's long-term  stability and prosperity.    While the report recognizes China's economic success and the  importance of its international role, it makes indiscreet  remarks about China's internal affairs and even attempted to  meddle in them. We would like to remind the authors of this  report that they should have some sense of history and reality.  Today's China is no longer the old China which could be bullied  at will. People will never forget the role Britain played on  the Tibet issue, and we can only hope it will draw lessons from  history and adopt a prudent attitude. Any attempt to create "two  Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" runs counter to the  principles governing the establishment of diplomatic relations  between China and Britain and therefore will meet our firm  opposition.    A reporter asked: What is the purpose of Vice Premier Zou  Jiahua's forthcoming visit to the United States. When will he  make the trip? What will be the main issues to be discussed?  Is China ready to concede on the most-favored-nation status  issue?    The spokesman answered: Vice Premier Zou Jiahua will pay an  official to the United States from 27 April to 8 May at the  invitation of the U.S. Government    Ever since the official meeting between Presidents Jiang  Zemin and Clinton in Seattle last November, bilateral exchanges  and contacts have been increasing at all levels and in all  fields. The main purpose of Vice Premier Zou Jiahua's visit is  to maintain the momentum of high-level exchanges between the two  countries, to enhance understanding, and develop cooperation.  During Vice Premier Zou's visit to the United States, he will  have extensive contacts with U.S. leaders, government officials,  and business personages. He will exchange views with them on  Sino-U.S. ties, Sino-U.S. economic cooperation and trade, and  other issues of common concern, in order to promote the  improvement and development of the two countries' relations [tui  dong liang guo guan xi de jin yi bu gai shan he fa zhan 2236  0520 0357 0948 7070 4762 4104 6651 0001 2975 2395 0810 0735 4099  1455].    A reporter asked: A report says that Premier Li Peng's  current trip to four Central Asian countries aims at contending  with Russia for influence in the countries of the Commonwealth  of Independent States. What is your comment on this?    Wu Jianmin replied: Premier Li Peng's current trip to four  Central Asian countries is to reciprocate the visits paid by  their leaders to China, and the purpose is to enhance mutual  understanding with these countries, promote good neighborliness,  and develop mutually beneficial cooperation. The trip is by no  means directed against [zhen dui 6859 1417] any third country.  The friendly cooperation between China and Russia is developing  steadily in all fields. We want to see that the friendly  relations between Russia and the Central Asian countries, which  are our neighbors and Russia's, will continue to develop.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Siemens to shed 7,000 jobs as profits shrink Siemens, the German electronics and electrical group, yesterday announced it was cutting a further 7,000 jobs this year. The news came alongside confirmation that annual operating profits were likely to fall by between 10 and 15 per cent. Mr Heinrich von Pierer, president and chief executive, said that by the end of September the total workforce would be reduced to 385,000. Additional staff from the inclusion of the Osram Sylvania lighting business in the US had masked a reduction of 13,000 jobs, he told the summer press conference in Prague. While there were 'a number of signs of an upward trend' in the German economy, the improving business climate would not have an impact on the company's results this year, which ends in September, said Mr von Pierer. Although new orders for the eight months to May were up 6 per cent at DM56.7bn (Dollars 35bn) and sales were 3 per cent higher at DM50.4bn, the increase came from foreign business. Domestic orders and sales were down. For Germany in the same period, domestic orders fell 7 per cent to DM22.2bn and sales were down 6 per cent at DM20.8bn. Foreign orders increased 17 per cent to DM34.5bn, while sales were up 11 per cent at DM29.6bn. Foreign business now accounted for more than 60 per cent of Siemens' total operations, up from less than 55 per cent in the last financial year, said Mr von Pierer. This reflected the more rapid advances in America and South-East Asia, compared with Europe. He said that Siemens expected to achieve the orders and sales targets it set itself at the beginning of the year. It anticipated new orders of DM87bn, up from DM84.1bn, and sales of DM84bn, against DM81.6bn. These increases were mostly due to the initial contributions of Osram Sylvania. Net income remained 'under pressure', however, because of continuing price deterioration and weak underlying sales. Mr Karl-Hermann Baumann, chief financial officer, said operating income this year would fall by 10-15 per cent. He added that this would be offset by an extraordinary gain from the sale of the cardiac pacemaker division, which would be included in fourth-quarter figures. Siemens expected to pay an unchanged dividend. 'I think you can say there will not be too much change in either direction,' Mr Baumann said. The group paid DM13 per share in the last financial year.</p>

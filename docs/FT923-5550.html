			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Gardening: Blooming, old-fashioned effort - A garden to visi / Arthur Hellyer revisits Rosemoor in Devon and is surprised and excited at the imaginative planting I HAVE just revisited Rosemoor, the Royal Horticultural Society's new garden at Great Torrington, Devon, two years after its opening and was astonished by the growth of the new planting. It is extensive and brilliant. Rosemoor lies in a well-wooded valley through which the Torridge flows. The B3220 road from Great Torrington to Exeter cuts through the estate. The house and garden are on the east side of that in the upper part of the valley. Since 1989, when Lady Anne Palmer gave the property to the Royal Horticultural Society, a completely new garden has been designed for the large area of land on the other side of the road running almost down to the river. It is being planned for all-season display with great masses of flower colour. Lady Anne's garden is much more restrained in character with many fine trees and shrubs and a peak flower display in May and early June when the rhododendrons and azaleas are at their best. The RHS has built a fine visitor centre just below the road on the west side and this not only contains a shop, restaurant and library but also serves as a focal point for the new garden which lies below and can be overlooked from the paved terraces around the building. Garden design is largely formal with four huge rectangles immediately below the visitor centre, one devoted entirely to shrub and old-fashioned roses, a second to modern roses and the third and fourth called colour theme gardens. These are filled with a miscellany of plants in which hardy herbaceous perennials predominate. Shrubs and annuals are also used. The master plan has been by Elizabeth Banks Associates, but the planting, which is brilliantly successful is almost entirely by Christopher Bailes, the garden's curator. He is also responsible for the planting in formal beds around and immediately below the visitor centre with half-hardy perennials. This is of particular interest to home gardeners. Many may be able to grow some of these plants from summer cuttings or by division and to overwinter them in frames, conservatories or sunny windows. There are wide paths flanked by herbaceous borders and, again, the planting schemes are excellent and the growth superb. Much of the explanation for this fine performance is the fact that every square yard of ground has been double dug in the old fashioned way, 2ft deep, the upper soil well-manured. This is the way all good English gardens were cultivated early this century and it is still the best way. There is a highly original potager, or ornamental fruit and vegetable garden, surrounded by walls on which ornamental gourds grow and with complex wrought iron arches for vines and other climbers. Beside this is a paved herb garden intended especially for the disabled in which the seats have been kept low and the borders built up well above ground level. It was only completed this spring but from the established look of the garden you would never guess. More is on the way. A cottage garden already has its summer house, framed with seasoned oak which is fitted together in the old fashioned way without nails or screws, infilled with wattle and daub and with a thatched roof. The soil will be double-dug this autumn and planted next spring in an easy-going cottage manner without too much thought about clever colour schemes. There is also to be a foliage and plantsman's garden with planing by Christopher Bailes. Already in existence are a long, lavishly planted streamside garden coming down the hill from Lady Anne's garden. The pool in her garden has been filled in and a larger pond and bog garden made. A new lecture wing is to be added to the visitor centre this winter and there is plenty of room outdoors for further development as time and money permits. One of the reasons for the good order and rapid growth in this garden is that about 30 volunteers come and work free in it for a few hours each week, each being given his or her own section and each vying to ensure that theirs is the best.</p>

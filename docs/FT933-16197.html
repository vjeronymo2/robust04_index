			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / International Company News: Securities units are set up by three Japanese banks THREE LEADING Japanese banks, the Industrial Bank of Japan, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and Norinchukin, the agriculture bank, have set up securities subsidiaries, allowed as part of ongoing financial deregulation. The ministry of finance has given banks a greater role in bond markets, while existing securities houses will be allowed to establish trust banking subsidiaries and be given more freedom in foreign exchange dealings. IBJ Securities is capitalised at Y25bn (Dollars 232m) and will have an initial staff of 138, while LTCB Securities is capitalised at Y20bn and will have a staff of 85. Norinchukin Securities has a capital of Y15bn and 42 employees. The banks had prepared several months ago for the establishment of the securities subsidiaries, but were awaiting approval from the finance ministry, which still has great influence over the entry of companies into new markets. The ministry is expected to review deregulation early next year and consider giving permission to a broader range of banks to open subsidiaries. The ministry has also indicated that, after two or three years, banks may be allowed to deal in stocks, although that is opposed by brokers. The new securities subsidiaries are expected to begin trading later this month, and are likely to concentrate on winning new business in the underwriting of straight bonds, increasingly popular among Japanese companies seeking to diversify their sources of funds.</p>

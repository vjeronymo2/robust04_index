			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Fall in underwriting losses helps recovery at Allianz Allianz, Europe's biggest insurance group, staged a stronger-than-expected recovery last year, when pre-tax profits rose 25 per cent to DM2bn (Dollars 1.25bn). Underwriting losses shrank to DM1.2bn from DM1.7bn, while a one-off tax credit related to corporate taxation changes helped hoist net earnings to DM1.46bn from DM860m in 1992, the group reported yesterday. According to Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle, chairman, Allianz hoped to lower the underwriting deficit below DM1bn this year, while premium income growth would be less than 10 per cent after a 20 per cent rise to DM66bn in 1993. The group's premium income was bolstered last year by the first-time consolidation of Deutschen Krankenversicherung, health insurer. The chairman appeared concerned at the continuing weakness of the dollar. Every one pfenning fall in the value of the US currency from its fixing of DM1.7263 on December 31, 1993 would reduce group sales by about DM100m, he said. While the group remained open to further acquisitions, Mr Schulte-Noelle said it would consider only strategically sensible purchases. Negotiations with France's Credit Lyonnais were related only to possible co-operation, he added. There were no plans to take it over or acquire a stake. Allianz wanted to strengthen its distribution in France, Italy, UK and Austria through collaboration with banks. The group had already informed the Austrian government that it wanted to link up with the state-owned Creditanstalt Bankverein, although negotiations were still at an early stage, Mr Schulte-Noelle said. It might be interested in a minority stake, possibly with other partners, if the government would surrender some of its holding. Allianz last month extended its reach in Switzerland when it took a 30 per cent stake in Berner Holding. International business last year accounted for 47.5 per cent of sales compared with 46.8 per cent in 1992, with the American markets contributing almost half of all non-German business, the bank said. Foreign premium income increased to DM31bn from DM26bn, while domestic sales rose to DM34bn from DM29bn.</p>

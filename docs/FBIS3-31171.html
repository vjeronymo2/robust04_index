The meeting, which started on Wednesday (9 February), was  originally expected to deal with the creation of a parliamentary  majority, but it is, in fact, busy with maintaining the unity of  the HZDS.    The meeting was attended by Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik,  Transport Minister Roman Hofbauer, Agriculture Minister Jozef  Baco and Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac today. In addition,  representatives of the Slovak National Party (SNS), the minor  coalition party, were present but when the internal HZDS affairs  were discussed, they left the room.    According to the independent daily NARODNA OBRODA, the  "alternative faction" in the HZDS led by Moravcik and Kovac came  into being on Wednesday. No one has, however, confirmed the  information.    The paper claimed that the 16-deputies-strong faction  advocated the idea of creating a broad government coalition  without participation of party leaders. They consider the  solution to be temporary as they assume early elections called  for early 1995.</p>

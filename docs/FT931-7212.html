			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Jyske Bank in the red but holds payout JYSKE BANK, Denmark's fourth-ranking bank, is holding the annual dividend at 10 per cent after reporting a net loss of DKr919m (Dollars 148.16m) last year against a profit of DKr47m in 1991. Loss provisions increased to DKr1.26bn from DKr873m. A write-off of DKr344m by a Gibraltar subsidiary contributed heavily to the provisions. The second main item in the group's poor performance last year was a loss of DKr25m on the adjustment for the value of the securities portfolio. In 1991, this item yielded a gain of DKr558m. The group slimmed the balance sheet by almost DKr10bn to end the year at DKr53.3bn. The slimming exercise was a factor helping to increase the group's capital adequacy ratio to 11.9 per cent from 11.6 per cent in 1991. The legal minimum last year was 10 per cent. The loss per share last year was DKr128m. The loss was equal to 30.4 per cent of shareholder's equity, which was reduced from DKr3.44bn to DKr2.60bn, the bank said. The group budgets for a profit on its ordinary activities of DKr150mto DKr250m in 1993.</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Major 'wins backing' to slow pace of Emu MR JOHN MAJOR believes he has won support from several other European Community members for moderating the pace of economic and monetary union. After lengthy talks with Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, in London on Tuesday, Mr Major telephoned Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday and then had a working lunch with Mr Michel Rocard, the visiting French premier. Though France is as keen as ever to press ahead, not only with Emu, but with political union, British officials consider that both the German and Spanish governments are now anxious not to rush towards a monetary union before there is greater convergence of EC economies. The views of Germany and Spain are very similar to those of Britain, the officials maintain. The Dutch and Irish are also said to be more or less on the same wavelength as the British. It would therefore be a mistake to expect big developments at the EC summit in Luxembourg next month, they say. Mr Gonzalez said after his talks with Mr Major that 'it would probably be a mistake to come to conclusions too quickly. One would have to wait until December. There are many political reasons for waiting in order to achieve reasonable results from both intergovernmental conferences (on Emu and political union).' Mr Major and Mr Rocard also discussed the prospects for a common European foreign and security policy. According to officials they agreed on the general principle that Europe should play a greater role in defence policy, but that this should not undermine Nato.</p>

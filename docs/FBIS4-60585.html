			<p>BFN     [Text] Pakistan decided to submit a peace plan to Afghan  leaders next week during the reopening of its mission in  Afghanistan. This was stated by Foreign Minister Sardar Asif  Ahmad Ali in Islamabad yesterday. He said the peace plan has  been formulated on the basis of proposals by influential Afghan  leaders, which provides a common basis for establishing peace in  the war- ravaged country of Afghanistan. The foreign minister  said that he will visit Kabul on 25 May for this purpose. He  said that he held talks with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud  al-Faysal, Crown Prince Turki, and leaders of other countries  after receiving requests from Afghan leaders. He said that he  held a similar exchange of views with UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali to secure his assistance in establishing peace in  Afghanistan.    Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali also announced that Pakistan will  establish a mission in (Hayat) and a consulate in Mazar-e  Sharif. This indicates the importance Pakistan attaches to  these places, which link Pakistan with Central Asian countries.</p>

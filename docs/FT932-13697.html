			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Letter: Pressure of time, not boredom, behind short cuts taken by junior auditing staff Sir, Andrew Jack's article about our research into irregular auditing (''Bored' junior auditors take short cuts' April 8) gives a useful picture of our work. We should like to stress, however, that it does not seem to be boredom which is most associated with junior staff taking irregular short cuts, but pressure imposed by time, budgets and/or a perception that particular audit tests are not important. Andrew Jack's report also states that our methods were criticised by 'some academics'. As we recall, the only academic to criticise our methods when our paper was presented at the recent meeting of the British Accounting Association was the director of research of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). There was in fact considerable support for our methods and the credibility of our findings from the official discussant of the paper, experienced social researchers and other members of the substantial audience at the presentation. Readers of our paper will need to make up their own minds about whether we have identified a cause for concern, but we feel it is scarcely credible that alleged biases in design and response would produce evidence of so many junior accountants taking irregular short cuts, if the practice was not in fact common. We hope that, instead of attempting to denigrate the reliability of our findings, firms of accountants and all the accountancy bodies involved in auditing will take our results seriously. (It is unlikely that the behaviour we have described is confined to students and members of ICAEW.) We have offered to work with firms of accountants to investigate further the range of irregular shortcuts taken by staff, an offer which is still open, and we also look to the auditing bodies to support further independent research.

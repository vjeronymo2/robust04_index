			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASADENA TOURNAMENT OF ROSES MARKS ITS CENTENNIAL FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Having been born and raised in Pasadena starting in 1914, I feel I have a right  to complain about the commercialization of so many of the floats in the "modern  day" Tournament of Roses parade. The parade was originally conceived as a happy  and joyful celebration of the coming of the new year; not as a money-making  advertising media for corporations. It is both derading and debasing to the  original concept for these companies to compete for the biggest, the tallest  and the most gaudy float.  </P> <P> Somewhere along the line the Tournament of Roses committee has lost sight of  the original concept -- the personally decorated carriages, automobiles, and  horses. My mother would spend days putting together a wreath and other  decorations for dad's horse which he proudly rode to celebrate the New Year.  </P> <P> WALTER M. DOTY  </P> <P> San Dimas  </P></p>

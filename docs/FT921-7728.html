			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Scandal prompts Austrian move to outlaw insider deals AUSTRIA is likely to make insider trading a criminal offence, despite fears that this will further encroach on citizens' right to hold anonymous bank accounts. Pressure to curb insider trading on the Vienna Stock Exchange has increased sharply since a scandal erupted in December over sales of shares of IGM Robotersysteme in advance of an announcement of a downward revision of the computer group's earnings forecast. At the moment, the only sanctions against insider trading in securities in Austria are those applied by the stock exchange on its members, and it has been easy for offenders to hide behind anonymous bank accounts. Austria is one of the few western countries that still permits people to hold anonymous accounts. The system is mainly used by Austrians to avoid taxes, and many oppose any suggestion that it be eliminated. Nevertheless, the government has been under pressure from the US to do just that, because these accounts are sometimes used by foreign criminals, notably to launder drugs money. Also, to prepare for membership in the European Community, Austria will have to tighten its banking practices to conform with EC requirements. Last month, the Austrian banking community agreed to improve its screening of deposits by foreigners. In the past, banks required identification from foreigners seeking to deposit more than Dollars 200,000. From now on, they will insist on identification of anyone depositing more than the equivalent of ASch200,000 (Dollars 17,237) in any foreign currency. Bankers and government officials say measures are likely to be taken later this year to deter insider trading. First, the authorities will be able to oblige banks and brokers to waive bank secrecy and divulge information about clients' transactions. Second, the stock exchange will require member firms to know the identity of their clients, even if those clients deal from numbered bank accounts. Austrian officials say that even after these changes the ordinary citizen need not worry. He can still hide his savings in an anonymous account.</p>

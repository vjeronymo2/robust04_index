			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 KOREAS OK HIGH-LEVEL TALKS IN MAJOR STEP TOWARD RECONCILIATION  </P> <P> North Korea and South Korea took a major step toward reconciliation Tuesday and  agreed to a historic meeting between their top government leaders.  </P> <P> The talks could be held as early as August, officials said.  </P> <P> Delegates from the two countries met at the border truce village of Panmunjom  and agreed to sign an accord July 26 that would outline a proposed agenda and  procedures for the first meeting of prime ministers.  </P> <P> It would be the first such meeting since the division of the peninsula in 1945  into the Communist north and capitalist south.  </P> <P> In earlier talks, both sides agreed that the summit would be held alternately  in the countries' capitals. Each side would have seven representatives,  including the prime minister and two military delegates.  </P> <P> The breakthrough on a summit came after South Korea accepted North Korea's  proposal to place political and military topics ahead of humanitarian and other  exchanges on the agenda. Seoul had insisted on the opposite.  </P> <P> Tuesday's meeting was the seventh of a series since February, 1989. The talks  had been suspended for five months.  </P> <P> Unlike most dialogue between the countries, Tuesday's was largely free of  acrimony and tension.  </P> <P> South Korea's chief delegate, Song Han Ho, later said he expects no problems in  signing a procedural agreement for the summit. His northern counterpart, Paik  Nam Jun, expressed similar views at a separate news conference.  </P> <P> Song said he hopes the prime ministers' talks will open "a new chapter for  realizing peaceful unification of the peninsula."  </P> <P> "We cannot stick to the logic of the Cold War and ignore changes in the world  any longer," he said.  </P> <P> Paik said Tuesday's accord "marked a new milestone in the history of the  North-South Korea dialogue."  </P> <P> Tuesday's agreement was widely seen as a major breakthrough in that dialogue.  </P> <P> South Korean officials said arms reduction and other measures easing tensions  could be discussed at the prime ministers' meeting as a first step toward  eventual unification.  </P></p>

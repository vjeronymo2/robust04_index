			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Well, Dr. Amos Sawyer used to be the interim  president of Liberia but last year, when a new peace agreement  between the warring factions took effect he had to step down as  part of the deal. However, he has remained in the public eye  and even continues to attract some controversy. Dr. Sawyer  helps to run an organization called the Center for Democratic  Empowerment which analyzes political developments in Liberia and  helps to find solutions to the problems that may arise, but some  people are accusing the organization of setting out to promote  ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire  Monitoring Group], the peacekeeping force which is trying to end  the fighting in Liberia. Well, Cholo Brooks met Dr. Amos Sawyer  in Monrovia and asked him for his response to that accusation.    [Begin recording] [Sawyer] Indeed, we have no qualms about  promoting ECOMOG here for what ECOMOG is doing and what ECOMOG  has done here. Now, we know there are a few warlords that for  their own purposes may play down this effort. The fact that  Monrovia and the refugee camps combined have perhaps two-thirds  of the population of this country is an indication that people  are running to ECOMOG-protected areas and there they find some  security.    [Brooks] Okay, one thing that perhaps worries people or  people always think of is that Amos Sawyer was a one-time  president of the interim government and at that time he was  advocating for lasting peace, and at the same time asking the  people to lay down their arms, but still people are still having  arms and there has been no progress yet.    [Sawyer] We are concerned and saddened by the fact that  there  is not so much progress with respect to disarmament but you see  Liberians have to get deeply involved in this process. We  cannot see disarmament as an activity that involves warlords,  ECOMOG, and UNOMIL [UN Observer Mission in Liberia] and the rest  of the Liberian society stands aside as spectators. Who are to  be disarmed? They are young men but are Liberians. Where have  they come from? They have come from our villages, they are part  of our families, they have been associated with our schools and  our churches and our mosques, and all of these and so the  institutional heads and forces of all of these various  structures should all bring their influence to bear on the  process of disarmament.    [Brooks] Okay, back to the center itself. Is your center  connected with any international institutions?    [Sawyer] We are a new outfit and we intend to go from  strength to strength. We intend to begin (?giving) our modest  resources, looking at the issues that are at hand here. We have  just finished preparing our agenda for Liberia. We are now  consulting with colleagues across this continent, largely in  West Africa and in some related institutions in Europe and the  United States. We are interested in applied research  consultancy on these crucial problems of governance and we will  seek resources from international sources basically to attack  some of these problems and see if we can make some headway.    [Brooks] Okay, Dr. Sawyer, as you know there is a deadline  with regard to elections in September and your organization is  taking part in the coming election. How do you look at the  (?date) set for the election to be held here?    [Sawyer] Well, first let me make some comments here that we  are not going to take part in the election as an institution but  we are very much interested in the development of a responsible  electorate. We believe that at this stage in the development of  Liberia, what we should be trying to come up with during the  first postwar elections here is something of a grand convenant  where a national convenant will be agreed upon by political  parties and leaders so we do not find a "winner-take-all"  situation and that we can move smoothly through the first six  years of the postwar era with all hands on board attacking the  problems of reconciliation and reconstruction.

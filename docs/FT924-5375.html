			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Bank ready to aid European growth THE European Investment Bank is ready to take on a bigger role in financing infrastructure projects in the EC if asked to by European politicians, its president, Mr Ernst-Gunther Broder, said yesterday. He emphasised, however, that it would only take on projects that made economic sense, adding that the bank has recently strengthened its credit appraisal methods. He also warned that it would take 'a year or two' from the time a project was brought to the bank to when money was paid out. Mr Broder's comments, made at a London briefing, follow suggestions from other EIB officials in recent days that the bank would look askance if asked to take a leading role in any emergency growth package to stimulate economic activity in Europe. 'As far as the bank is concerned, we would be prepared to get involved in any scheme to appraise projects,' Mr Broder said. 'If asked, we would increase the speed of financing. We are ready to do this.' He added that the bank, which can lend up to half a project's costs, waits for proposals to be brought to it by member states. Of the big infrastructure projects mentioned in recent days as a way of stimulating growth, he said: 'They are all projects we had on our desks before.' The EIB uses only about half its capital base to support current projects, leaving capacity for substantial extra lending. Given the backing of European member states and its track record, there is no limit on its ability to borrow in the international capital markets, said Mr Broder. He added that the bank would consider in some cases issuing guarantees to commercial banks to back their loans. rather than lending directly itself. The EIB is prepared to provide up to Pounds 100m towards building the Jubilee Line underground extension to London's docklands, officials suggested yesterday. The bank, which has already lent Pounds 100m to Olympia &amp; York, developer of the Canary Wharf project, said it was willing to back the extension to ensure Canary Wharf's future. The bank would lend only to support private backers of the project.</p>

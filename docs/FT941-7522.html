			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / NatWest surges at pre-tax level: Fall in provisions - Trading surplus rises only 9% / 'Going has been tougher' A 30 per cent fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts to Pounds 1.26bn, from Pounds 1.79bn, allowed National Westminster Bank to raise pre-tax profits sharply last year, despite a reduction in income from lending. Britain's second biggest bank showed the pressures on high street banks' lending business, even though non-interest income was boosted by capital markets and foreign exchange trading, as well as by heavy sales of life insurance policies. Although pre-tax profits surged to Pounds 989m from Pounds 367m in 1992, the trading surplus of income over expenses rose by only 9 per cent to Pounds 2.4bn, against Pounds 2.2bn. Lord Alexander, NatWest chairman, said this was achieved through tight management of costs and efforts to diversify sources of income. 'The going has been a lot tougher' in the UK branch banking operations, which returned to a profit of Pounds 180m, compared with a Pounds 137m loss. He anticipated that lending would 'remain subdued for some time.' Net interest income fell by 2 per cent to Pounds 3.68bn, partly because the net interest margin on assets narrowed from 3 per cent to 2.8 per cent. Increased competition for domestic savings contributed to the margin fall. The return on ordinary equity rose to 10.8 per cent, against 3 per cent, although the bank's stated target is 17.5 per cent. Lord Alexander said the return was inadequate. The bank was confident that it could reach its target rate, but it might have to consider reducing that target if UK inflation and interest rates remained low. The most profitable business sector of the bank was NatWest Markets, its corporate and investment banking arm, which made a profit of Pounds 453m, against Pounds 232m. There were record profits in capital markets. NatWest Life, the life insurance subsidiary, contributed Pounds 60m to profits, while Lombard North Central, the assets and personal finance arm, increased profits to Pounds 178m, compared with Pounds 116m for the previous 15 months. Assets weighted by risk fell by Pounds 4.5bn to Pounds 103.4bn because of a lack of lending growth. With retained earnings of Pounds 276m, this helped the ratio of tier one capital to risk-weighted assets to rise from 5.2 to 5.7 per cent. Expenses increased by 2 per cent to Pounds 4.58bn, including a 4 per cent rise in staff costs. This was partly cause by a rise in staff profit-sharing and profit-related pay, despite a net reduction of 3,800 in staff numbers. NatWest raised its total dividend by 6 per cent to 18.5p, after a final payout of 12.1p (11.375p). The increase in the total was less than those made by TSB Group and Lloyds. Earnings per share advanced from 10p to 35p. The shares closed 28.5p down at 503.5p. Lex, Page 26</p>

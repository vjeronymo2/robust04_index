			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Jobs hang on claim of CFC-free refrigerator HUNDREDS of jobs in one of east Germany's most blighted regions are hanging on a company's claim to have developed an environmentally safe refrigerator. DKK Scharfenstein, east Germany's sole producer of refrigerators, claims its 'eco-refrigerator' is a technological breakthrough because its compressor operates with a propane-butane mix instead of the standard chlorofluorocarbons, which damage the ozone layer. However, the company has already been accused of adopting desperate measures with its claimed breakthrough because it faces imminent demise. It lost DM85m (Pounds 29.3m) last year on turnover of DM71m and the Treuhand privatisation agency has appointed a liquidator. Once flourishing sales of refrigerators in west Germany plummeted after monetary union in 1990 and the collapse of the Soviet market for compressors. Mr Franz Wauschkuhn, Treuhand spokesman, said the Treuhand was paying a subsidy of DM50 for each of the 200,000 refrigerators DKK produces annually. DKK would have to cut its 1,900 workforce down to 600 to become profitable, he said. The west German Electro-technical Federation (ZVEI) called the new refrigerator a 'hoax', arguing that the propane-butane mixture was not only inefficient but liable to explode, raising awkward questions of product liability. It also claimed that the refrigerator used 40 per cent more electricity than conventional models. DKK says the gap is only 20 per cent and narrowing. However, Mr Wolfgang Lohbeck, of the Greenpeace environmental organisation, accused an 'unholy alliance' of the west German electro-technical and chemical industries of rejecting an ecologically sound product in order to protect profits. The Treuhand, caught in the middle, said the liquidator had commissioned an expert opinion on the new refrigerator which, if positive, could mean hundreds of saved DKK jobs.</p>

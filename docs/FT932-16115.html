			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Burmah to pay Dollars 48m for ICI lubricants offshoot BURMAH CASTROL, the lubricants, chemicals and fuels group, has agreed to pay Dollars 48.3m (Pounds 31.7m) for Tribol, an ICI subsidiary which makes and markets industrial lubricants internationally. Tribol, which employs about 300 people, has manufacturing plants in the US and Germany. It also has wholly owned operations in Canada, Chile, France, Italy, Mexico and Spain, as well as distributors in 50 other countries. Burmah is funding the acquisition through a placing by Schroders of 4.5m new shares with institutions at 705p. Burmah's shares closed 16p lower at 732p. Burmah said the acquisition was not expected to dilute earnings and would complement the group's existing activities in industrial lubricants. It would fit particularly well with Optimpol, the German speciality grease and lubricants manufacturer it bought in 1990. Tribol was acquired by ICI in 1985 as part of the Beatrice Chemical purchase. It is being sold by Zeneca, ICI's bioscience arm, which is about to be demerged. ICI said: 'While Tribol is a strong business with a good reputation, it was not a strategic business for Zeneca Specialities and should have greater opportunity to flourish within Burmah Castrol.' Tribol had sales of Dollars 53m last year and made pre-tax profits of Dollars 3.7m, which were depressed by exceptional restructuring costs of about Dollars 1.3m. It had net assets of Dollars 21m at the year-end. Burmah said Tribol focused on products for arduous conditions in niche markets. Its main industries were in the mining, automotive, steel, cement and paper sectors. Its principal products were speciality greases, open-gear lubricants, gear oils, and chain and wire lubricants. The industrial speciality lubricants market is worth an estimated Dollars 1bn and is highly fragmented. Burmah said competitors tended to be only regional or nationally oriented, and the acquisition of Tribol would make the group a world leader in this sector.</p>

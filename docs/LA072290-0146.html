			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: FALDO PLAYS SPOILER -- OF GREAT STORIES  </P> <P> It was supposed to be Dempsey-Tunney.  </P> <P> How about Tyson-Spinks?  </P> <P> It was supposed to be the golf equivalent of a battle of the century, a  heavyweight championship fight. In this corner, the Great White Shark,  everybody's favorite, all those teeth and white-on-white hair, the most famous  peroxide blond since Jean Harlow. Mr. Charisma, the flashy slugger from Down  Under, the crowd-pleaser, the knockout artist.  </P> <P> In this corner dour, dark, gloomy Nick Faldo, the guy who looks as if just got  word his house is on fire and his insurance has lapsed. The cautious,  counter-punching, back-pedaling ring general. Nobody's favorite but a hard man  to beat, a hard man to lay a glove on.  </P> <P> It was a one-round knockout, as one-sided as a Joe Louis bum-of-the-month tour.  </P> <P> Mr. Blah gave Mr. Charisma a lesson in heady, canny, strategic play. He knocked  him through the ropes, all over the ring.  </P> <P> If it were really a fight, they would have stopped it. At the 13th hole. No  later. By then, Greg Norman was in no position to defend himself. He was  glassy-eyed, wobbly, out of it. He looked -- and played -- like a guy looking  up at the ring clock hoping for the bell.  </P> <P> Nick Faldo spoiled one of the great stories of the year, one of the great  matchups of golf history. We were looking for Hogan-Snead, Palmer-Nicklaus,  Jones-Sarazen. We got one of the great mismatches of golf history.  </P> <P> Faldo-Norman were supposed to play the two final rounds of this year's British  Open toe-to-toe, trading blows, birdie-for-birdie, eagle-for-eagle.  </P> <P> Instead, it was Secretariat at the Belmont, the Titanic against the iceberg.  </P> <P> Nick Faldo made Round Four of the 1990 British Open a formality.  </P> <P> It won't be a tournament, it'll be a parade -- a recital by the artist. The  great confrontation got sidetracked. Norman couldn't really answer the bell by  the ninth hole. Faldo not only beat him to the punch, he turned him back with  almost contemptuous ease without even looking concerned. By the time he got  through, Norman wasn't even in his twosome for today's final round. He got  shuffled all the way back to a starting time one hour before the leaders. Corey  Pavin, Tim Simpson and Nick Price stood between Norman and Faldo in the  pairings, to say nothing of Frank Nobilo, Paul Broadhurst and Craig Parry, all  of whom shot past Greg.  </P> <P> On a day when someone named Paul Broadhurst could shoot a 63, Greg Norman had  to struggle to break 80.  </P> <P> Faldo ruined the story -- but he had help from Norman. Norman is a specialist  at disappointing his fans, but he usually does it by having somebody chip in  over his head or come flying out of a sand trap into a hole or by sinking a  170-yard seven-iron from out on the fairway.  </P> <P> Faldo didn't need any of these heroics. He beat him shot by shot, hole by hole.  He merely shot a nice, easy, steady 67. It so unnerved Greg he began hitting  the ball all over the place, including into those little pot bunkers that  freckle the place and should be as avoidable as a bore at a cocktail party.  </P> <P> Greg, as he often does, went looking for trouble like a sailor on leave. Faldo  simply went about business like a law clerk cataloguing torts. He could play  his kind of golf in a three-piece suit. Norman hits the ball excitingly. Faldo  hits it straight.  </P> <P> He does it without changing expression. You can never tell from looking at him  whether Nick Faldo has just made birdie or bogey.  </P> <P> Except, he never makes bogey. He's only made two in this tournament over 54  holes. And the one he made at 17 Saturday was at least semi-deliberate. Jack  Nicklaus says that hole is really a par 4 1/2, not par four. If you hit for the  green over the chasm-sized bunker, you may make it -- and you may also make  nine from the road behind. Faldo hit his second shot short of the trouble and  made his nice comfortable bogey.  </P> <P> That's Faldo's game. He won a British Open three years ago hitting 18  consecutive pars on the final round. That's like winning a fight on clinches, a  baseball game on bunts, a Super Bowl on punts or a card game with treys.  </P> <P> That's all right with Nick Faldo. He plays how, not how many.  </P> <P> Don't bet he won't shoot a nice shrewd boring 72 or 73 today to smuggle his  British Open into the clubhouse. He says he won't. But Nick Faldo never shows  his cards.  </P> <P> We now have to consider this old Nick -- Nick Faldo, MBE for Member of the  British Empire, stepping stone to knighthood -- is not only one of the premier  players of the day but the premier player.  </P> <P> Golf has been waiting for a monarch for a long time. Golf functions best that  way. It resists mob rule, even democracy.  </P> <P> Faldo, it has been pointed out, in the last 12 "majors," has won three and been  in the top four in seven of them. He won the Masters this year (for the second  time), he was second in our Open (for the second time) and he seems about to  win his second British Open.  </P> <P> Those are Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus feats. Those are not posted  by the cookie cutter class of modern golfers.  </P> <P> Nick is not outwardly impressed with all his statistics. He is a rather gray  character who moves with the deliberateness of an old waiter, the singleness of  purpose of a lord-high executioner. He is dogged, relentless, careful, not  colorful. He is as phlegmatic as a border guard. He just goes out and shoots  par golf. He's not running for President. He leaves the smiling to Norman.  Faldo seems to be operating under a permanent cloud cover.  </P> <P> You would never mistake him for anything but an athlete. Like Norman, he has  the classic build of a Greek statue. His shoulders are broad, his waist narrow.  He almost never raises his voice. When a fellow competitor, Scott Hoch, was  quoted as saying of him that he "needed a charisma transplant," Faldo readily  accepted Hoch's explanation that he never said it. Faldo didn't really care. It  didn't cost him any shots.  </P> <P> It's too bad he can't win his Open (assuming he does) at St. Andrews. I mean,  this course cannot be that hallowed cradle of golf, that wrecker of scores,  that scourge of tournaments. This helpless piece of real estate is so  vulnerable this week -- no winds rake its promontories, no rain gales lash its  fairways -- that the leader board looks like an explosion in a ketchup factory.  It's full of red numbers, all but three players under par.  </P> <P> One of those under is MBE Faldo who has shot 199 or 17-under.  </P> <P> Don't expect jubilation from Faldo. Just another day at the office. Don't  expect any theatrics. Faldo won't go for the record, he'll go for the trophy.  Faldo doesn't play for the ages, Faldo plays for the victories.  </P> <P> Even if they spoil good stories.  </P></p>

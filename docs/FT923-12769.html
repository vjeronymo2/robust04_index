			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: 10 local authorities told to account for labour organisation losses THE government yesterday told 10 local authorities to account for losses incurred by their direct labour organisations last year, which may lead to the contracting-out of their work to the private sector, Andrew Adonis writes. Among the councils the greatest losses were incurred by Tower Hamlets in London, Halton in Cheshire and Gillingham in Kent. The government's action is seen as a warning to all authorities whose DLOs are performing poorly. Private businesses are concerned that without effective monitoring, competition for contracts under the government's compulsory competitive tendering legislation will be biased against them.</p>

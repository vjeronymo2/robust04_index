			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (21): Numbers crunch - Wage costs are important, but productivity differences mean their net effect on competitiveness is hard to calculate / Labour costs LABOUR costs play a large part in the debate about export competitiveness because they are easy to identify, more variable than some other costs and the subject of understandable political excitement. Labour cost differences are, of course, important, but they also need to be kept in perspective. In the high technology industries which are coming increasingly to dominate international trade they often make up only a small proportion of total costs. In the UK computer industry, for example, total wage costs, including national insurance contributions, represent only 15 per cent of production costs. In electronics they represent 34 per cent and in aerospace 33 per cent. Manual workers wages (both skilled and unskilled) account for only 4 per cent of production costs in computers, 13 per cent in electronics, and 23 per cent in aerospace. Hugh Stirk, head of personnel at Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company, also points out that in the consumer sector the freedom to choose where to site an export base is constrained by the need to be physically close to consumers. Nonetheless, there is a growing awareness that differences in wage, and especially non-wage, labour costs between countries can affect competitiveness. As Mr Stirk says, if it costs twice as much to employ a senior manager in Germany as in Britain, it will eventually have some effect. Employers' non-wage labour costs usually cover government social security levies plus, in some countries, pension and health payments for employees. Average figures comparing the US, Japan and the European Community show that in EC countries non-wage labour costs are about 24 per cent of total labour costs, only just ahead of the 23 per cent in the US, but comfortably ahead of Japan where they are 13 per cent. Those averages disguise huge differences between companies and countries. Within the EC, for example, Denmark has average non-wage labour costs of only 3 per cent while France, Italy, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands are all above 30 per cent. And even within one country, such as the United States, there can be huge differences in labour costs, depending on the sort of healthcare that employers provide. Combining both wage costs and non-wage costs, plus various other fringe benefits, the latest Economist Intelligence Unit survey of hourly labour costs in the manufacturing industry found that Germany was at the top of the list on Dollars 25.34, and comfortably well ahead of Switzerland on Dollars 22.48. They lead a high labour cost country list which includes Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Austria. Japan comes in just above Austria towards the bottom of the predominantly European list on Dollars 19.05. America heads a medium labour cost list with Dollars 16.58 coming ahead of France, Italy, Finland, the UK, Ireland and Spain. Those on the low labour cost list comprise Greece on Dollars 6.29 and Portugal on Dollars 4.69, which is about one-sixth the German level. Currency fluctuations can, of course, make an enormous difference. The reason why the average EC hourly rate fell below Japan for the first time ever this year is due to the rise of the yen. Similarly, the gap between the US and Europe has narrowed largely because of the strength of the dollar. Even more important, bald hourly labour cost figures take no account of differences in productivity. The important factor for employers is not the level of labour costs as such (and still less the non-wage cost element) but cost relative to the value-added generated by the labour that they employ. As the European Commission's report Employment In Europe 1993 states: 'Whatever the level of labour costs, if the contribution of a worker to value-added is sufficiently high, then it will be profitable to employ him or her.' Large differences in labour costs between countries are usually balanced by equally large variations in the level of productivity. According to the European Commission, for example, there are only two European Community countries - Germany and Denmark - where the level of productivity is substantially below the relative level of labour costs. On the other hand in four countries - the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Ireland and Portugal - the average labour costs are significantly lower than the relative level of productivity, which would imply low unit labour costs. However, absolute levels of manufacturing unit labour costs are difficult to calculate and big differences exist between the figures quoted. The latest calculations from the Trades Union Congress, based on figures from the US Department of Labour and the OECD, find unit labour costs in the US, Japan and Germany, to be, respectively, only 66 per cent, 65 per cent and 71 per cent of the UK level. When thinking about labour costs businesses need to take into account not only currencies and productivity but also the trends in cost differentials. As the London Economics consultancy has pointed out a substantial convergence of wages has taken place in the EC over the past 20 years. Spanish wages in 1970 were 29 per cent of those in Germany; in 1990 they had risen to 66 per cent. Italian wages in 1970 were 42 per cent of those in Germany; by 1990 they had risen to 71 per cent. So a decision based on the relative wage costs in 1970 might have looked very different had 1990 relative wage costs been taken into account.</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNDESERVED PUBLICITY FOR 'SHADOWS'  </P> <P> Re "Shadows on a Legend," I feel the record must be set straight (regarding)  the gossipmonger's false story about Randolph Scott, whom we have known since  1936.  </P> <P> Mr. Scott was the finest gentleman in every way, best husband and father, too.  </P> <P> We enjoyed his friendship through his 43 years of happy marriage, therefore,  positively state that Charles Higham's story is a fantasy.  </P> <P> MRS. DENNIS O'KEEFE  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

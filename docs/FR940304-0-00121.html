			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Section 279.10(g)(3)_Used Oil Inserted Into the Petroleum Refining Process Without Prior Mixing and Mixtures of Greater Than One Percent Used Oil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As previously stated, under today's rule, mixtures of used oil and crude oil containing less than 1% used oil that are transported to or stored at a petroleum refinery, and are introduced prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking, are exempt from part 279 standards under &sect;279.10(g)(2). It is EPA's understanding, based on information received from petroleum industry representatives, that used oil can potentially be inserted directly into the petroleum refining process prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking without either: (1) Mixing the used oil with crude oil feedstocks, or (2) pre-processing of the used oil to ensure that any contaminants in the used oil will not interfere with the refining process (e.g., contaminants fouling a catalyst, etc.). Based on this understanding, today's exemption also applies to used oil that is introduced directly into the petroleum refining process at a point prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking as long as the used oil comprises less than 1% of the crude oil feed to a petroleum refining facility process unit at any given time. Again, because of the high ratio of crude oil to used oil, EPA considers these mixtures to be equivalent to crude oil for regulatory purposes. Therefore, the Agency believes that this activity would pose no significant increase in risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Used oil that is inserted directly into the petroleum refining process (at a volume of less than 1% of the crude oil process unit feed at any given time) is considered mixed, and therefore exempt from part 279, at the point at which it enters the process. This exemption applies both to used oil generated at the petroleum refining facility where the used oil is being inserted, and to used oil generated off-site that is collected and transported to the petroleum refining facility for insertion into the refining process prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Used oil that is inserted into the petroleum refining process without first being mixed with crude oil feedstocks (e.g. in crude oil stock tanks) is subject to part 279 standards prior to insertion. Used oil that is generated on-site and then stored without prior mixing and used oil generated on-site that constitutes greater than 1% of a mixture of used and crude oil continues to be subject to the part 279, subpart C standards for generators. With the exception of used oil that is exempt from the part 279 standards because it constitutes less than 1% of a mixture of used oil and crude oil, used oil that is generated off-site and then transported to or stored at a petroleum refining facility, continues to be subject to the applicable part 279 requirements i.e., to the requirements for used oil transporters and transfer facilities while being transported and to the requirements for used oil processors upon receipt at the petroleum refining facility. Petroleum refining facilities that receive used oil from off-site for direct insertion into the petroleum refining process are subject to the used oil processor standards from the point at which they receive the used oil up until the point at which the used oil is inserted into the petroleum refining process. Finally, it is important to reiterate that the exemptions provided under both &sect;&sect;279.10(g)(2) and 279.10(g)(3) of today's rule apply at the point of mixing and only to mixtures that contain less than 1% of used oil.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although petroleum industry representatives have raised concerns that a 1% limit on the amount of used oil that can be inserted directly into the petroleum refining process may be technology limiting, EPA has not received any information that would support this position, nor has the Agency received information to support an alternative level. The Agency believes that by limiting the amount of used oil that can be introduced directly into the refining process exempt from the used oil processing standards, it can better ensure against mixing only to avoid compliance with the part 279 processing standards. If information becomes available that the 1% limit is inhibiting used oil recycling, the Agency will consider whether any change to the rules is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the draft rule, EPA proposed to regulate petroleum refining facilities that receive used oil from off-site as used oil transfer facilities prior to mixing. However, EPA agrees with comments on the draft rule that petroleum refining facilities that receive used oil from off-site pose the same potential concerns associated with receipt of adulterated used oil and improper storage of used oil as used oil re-refiners. Petroleum refining facilities that receive used oil from off-site may not have adequate information to ensure that the used oil has not not been improperly mixed with listed hazardous waste. Also, the volumes of used oil that may be managed require adequate planning for dealing with emergency releases. EPA has therefore revised the final rule to provide that petroleum refining facilities that receive and store used oil from off-site are subject to the used oil processor standards prior to mixing. The principal effect of this change is that petroleum refiners that receive used oil from off-site must prepare a waste analysis plan to ensure that the used oil has not been mixed with hazardous waste and must maintain an operating record to document compliance with the waste analysis plan. In addition, such refineries will have to adopt or amend emergency contingency plans to address used oil in accordance with &sect;279.52 of the used oil management standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4.

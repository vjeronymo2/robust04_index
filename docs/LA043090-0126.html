			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'NINJA TURTLES' SUCCUMBS TO A 'WOMAN'  </P> <P> After four weeks in the No. 1 spot at the nation's box office, "Teenage Mutant  Ninja Turtles" was finally beaten at the finish line.  </P> <P> Touchstone's romantic comedy, "Pretty Woman" starring Richard Gere and Julia  Roberts, had weekend ticket sales of about $7.3 million to edge New Line  Cinema's green wonders out of first place.  </P> <P> With ticket sales of about $6.7 million, the turtles had to settle for second.  </P> <P> But the turtles are still the apparent victors in the race toward the lofty  $100-million mark. To date, moviegoers have shelled out about $96 million for  the Turtles, while "Pretty Woman" has sold about $80 million in tickets.  </P> <P> Despite a critical clobbering, Universal Pictures' "The Guardian," directed by  William Friedkin ("The Exorcist"), scared up ticket sales of about $5.7 million  for third place. In release at about 1,685 theaters, the horror entry had a  per-screen-average of about $3,400.  </P> <P> In fourth place was Touchstone's out-ot-this-world comedy, "Spaced Invaders."  It earned about $4.7 million at 1,821 screens, for about $2,580 per screen.  </P> <P> Paramount Pictures' "The Hunt for Red October" edged closer to the $100-million  target. With weekend ticket sales of about $2.9 million, it ranked fifth, with  grosses of more than $99 million.  </P> <P> Tri-Star Pictures' gritty police drama "Q &amp; A," directed by Sidney Lumet  and starring Nick Nolte, had less-than-arresting ticket sales of about $2.8  million at 912 screens for sixth place -- about $3,200 per screen. This was  despite largely positive critical notices.  </P></p>

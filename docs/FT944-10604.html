			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Clinton defiant on economy in wake of Republican triumph President Bill Clinton yesterday answered the Republican party's most sweeping mid-term election triumph in nearly 50 years by promising to block opposition attempts to 'turn the clock back' to the economic policies of the 1980s. Alternately reflective and combative at an afternoon press conference, the president welcomed the offers of co-operation with the Democrat administration from the new Republican leadership in both houses of Congress. 'I ask them to join me in the centre of the public debate where the best ideas must come.' But, he said: 'I say to those who would use this election to turn us back . . . I will do all in my power to keep anyone from jeopardising this economic recovery by taking us back to the policies and exploding deficits that failed us before.' His analysis of the drubbing his party had taken, an adverse reflection of his own leadership, was not that the American people disliked the specifics of Democratic policies. 'They just don't like it when they see what we do up here.' Mr Robert Dole, about to become majority leader in the Senate, echoed these sentiments. 'If we don't deliver, we'll be out of here too,' he said. Congressman Newt Gingrich, Speaker-presumptive of the House, commented: 'Let the '96 presidential campaign come in '96.' Mr Gingrich said he would seek accommodation with the administration - on greater budgetary control, tax credits for middle-income families and welfare reform - before pressing ahead with the ideological elements in the Republican manifesto so inimical to President Clinton. In the same spirit, Mr Clinton called Mr Gingrich yesterday and, according to reports from both sides, offered, and received, pledges not to let the nation's government sink into gridlock. Mr Leon Panetta, White House chief of staff, said he had also spoken to Mr Gingrich on election night and extracted a pledge that the Republican 'would work with us to try and get the Gatt treaty passed' when both houses of the old Congress reconvene for votes at the turn of this month. The 52-48 Senate majority won by Republicans at the polls swelled by one when Senator Richard Shelby, the conservative Democrat from Alabama, announced he was crossing the political aisle. Flanked by Senators Dole and Phil Gramm, he said he was joining 'a party of hope for America' and leaving 'a party of dependency'. The overall results, in which no Republican incumbent in Congress was defeated, far exceeded the party's wildest dreams. But the Senate will have to get along without a Republican candidate who would have been difficult to imbue with any spirit of co-operation. Mr Oliver North lost in Virginia to Senator Charles Robb, but ominously promised to return. In California, Mr Michael Huffington, his pockets Dollars 25m (Pounds 15.2m) lighter as a result of his campaign, had still not publicly conceded his two-point defeat by Senator Dianne Feinstein, claiming that absentee ballots could yet vote him in. But these losses were more than offset by the cull of dozens of Democratic luminaries. The massacre leaves the country with a new political face. In the House, with nine contests still undecided, the Republicans had a provisional net gain of 49 and had already acquired an edge of about 227-198. The lone independent and nominal socialist, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, survived.  --------------------------------------------         US MID-TERM ELECTION RESULTS  --------------------------------------------                          NEW        OLD  -------------------------------------------- HOUSE*  -------------------------------------------- Democrat                 198        256 Republican               227        178  -------------------------------------------- SENATE  -------------------------------------------- Democrat                  47         56 Republican                53         44  -------------------------------------------- GOVERNORS**  -------------------------------------------- Democrat                  17         29 Republican                30         20 Independent                1          1  -------------------------------------------- *One independent and nine contests undecided.  -------------------------------------------- **Two contests undecided  -------------------------------------------- Election reports, Pages 6 and 7 Seeking solace, Page 23 Observer, Page 23 Editorial comment, Page 23 Lex, Page 24</p>

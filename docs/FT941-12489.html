			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Markets: Are equities heading for nirvana? - London Who can blame the equity market for pausing to take stock when the Tories tax like Labour and Lonrho reports like Hanson? 'Total deception,' thundered Labour as it challenged the Tories claim to be the low-taxers, when come April the Tory tax take will hit a record 32.9 per cent of average earners' income. 'There are no differences between Mr Bock and me . . . We will be acting as one,' beamed Tiny Rowland as peace broke out again at Lonrho. Clearly, the company's charismatic founder and Dieter Bock, his heir presumptive, fancy new roles to play. Perhaps they were rehearsing a double act along the lines of Lords White and Hanson. Consumer sensitive stocks wobbled on the tax news and Lonrho shares hit a two-year high, providing two of the few highlights in a week in which the market drifted lower and trading volumes eased. The FT-SE 100 fell for the first four days but recovered some yesterday to end the week down a net 36.8 points at 3,447.4. Shares were a shade unsettled after Wednesday's gilts auction was less successful than hoped. Appetite for the Pounds 2.75bn of gilts was weaker and bidding less aggressive than at the previous auction. But nobody believes the government faces a funding problem this year. A reminder of gilts' attractiveness came from BZW in its 39th annual review of investment returns. For the third time in five years gilts performed best, notching up a real total return of 26.4 per cent last year. Equities, despite all the market excitement, trailed at 25 per cent. Do not worry that stocks are now modestly overvalued on a dividend yield model, BZW advised investors. The bull market has plenty of life in it thanks to stimulative monetary policy and rising corporate profits which are claiming a growing share of GDP. If stocks were as overvalued as they were at the last peak in 1968, the FT-SE 100 would be trading at 5,500. 'I think the market has given up listening to analysts - that's what the sheer weight of money has done to it,' said one of the City's most persistent bears. He has argued strongly for a market retreat since the FT-SE 100 first challenged 3,100 but the torrent of money into the market has kept it rising. Not just the institutions have money to invest in equities. Last year, for example, a record Pounds 9.1bn - the bulk from private investors - poured into unit trusts. Investment trust launches took another Pounds 2.2bn, three times their record. The decision to switch money into equities is captured in the accompanying chart of funds flows of the personal sector in the UK. In 1988, individuals were still disinvesting from equities. The tide turned in 1992 and picked up last year, reflecting equities' attractiveness as interest rates fell. With people piling into equities, are we heading for an equity nirvana where stock tips spout forth from the mouths of elevator boys? Optimism is high but drama low, said Mary Blair, product development director for Fidelity, the UK fund manager. 'We have had a high volume of calls from customers since last autumn. But before Christmas many calls were administrative . . . such as checking on balances. Now people are saying 'I want to invest'.' Even so, 'they are a little more controlled, more sensible in their choice of investments than in 1987.' There is no sign yet of a panicky rush into equities, said Robin Aspinall, market strategist at Panmure Gordon. 'It's a liquidity push to stocks, not a price pull.' He worries that the liquidity will dry up sooner rather than later. It is impossible to forecast when the investment tide will turn but at some point investors will begin to hesitate over equities because, for example, of an upward turn in interest rates. 'You don't have to take money out of the market . . . just a reduction in the inward flow would start the downward spiral.' Cash flow was very much on the mind of supermarkets this week as first Wm Low, the Scottish chain, and J Sainsbury, the sector leader, delivered disturbing news of their tighter circumstances. Dealers took a leaf out of the supermarkets' own trading manuals and sharply cut share prices to clear surplus stock. The sector, revelling in historically high margins, had romped through the recession building expensive superstores with abandon. Then shoppers grew picky about prices and discounters began harrying the full-service chains. First Asda called the turn and adjusted its strategy, joined two weeks ago by Tesco with its own news of writedowns and a shift to smaller stores. This week Low, particularly hard hit by discounters, admitted its like-for-like sales had actually fallen and margins trimmed in its first half. Finally yesterday, Sainsbury fell into line. Its like-for-like sales and margins had fallen, it was writing off over-valued sites and starting to depreciate its assets. No-one doubts Sainsbury's clout, but it will not be using it to such profitable effect in the future. Elsewhere in the retail sector, Christmas sales continued to sort out the good from the indifferent and bad. Burton joined Dixons and Kingfisher in the third category. Next and MFI joined Storehouse, Signet and Laura Ashley in the first group. Burton was particularly disappointing. On Thursday, it delivered the worst of all possible scenarios: flat sales and falling margins, even from its revamped chains such as Top Shop and Principles. But cash flow was pushed into the shadows at Lonrho's headquarters when it announced results on Tuesday. The fact that the group can still barely generate enough cash from continuing operations to cover interest, dividends and tax was a sideshow. The limelight was on the Tiny-Dieter duet.</p>

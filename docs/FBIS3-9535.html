TELEGRAF writes that Frantisek Miklosko, chairman of the  deputies group of Slovakia's Christian Democratic Movement  (KDH), said that "Zeman submitted such an initiative during his  talks with the Slovak Social Democrats and part of (Slovakia's)  Democratic Left Party (SDL)...and according to his (Miklosko's)  information, the CSSD planned to include such an initiative into  its election program."    Novak said he spoke to Zeman every day but they had never  discussed such an initiative. He stressed that representatives  of social democracy had never discussed "a similar project"  either with Miklosko or SDL leaders, or leaders of the Social  Democratic Party in Slovakia (SDSS). CSSD has not dealt with  these questions since the split of the Czechoslovak Federation  on January 1, 1993, Novak said.    He stressed that the activity of Zeman as deputy to the now  defunct federal parliament in late 1992, by which he pushed for  the unity of the country, had not represented CSSD policy.  Zeman then had "only certain support" within the party, but not  of its central boards.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Observer: World servicing The BBC World Service, which has probably reported more revolutions than anybody, seems on the brink of one of its own. Sam Younger, 42, has been given the new job of director of broadcasting. Moreover, the World Service is about to be split into six regions, replacing the current divide between those who speak English and those who don't. The intention is to make the service more user-friendly. Maybe fans will no longer have to tune in at 3 am to catch a favourite programme. Even so, some old World Service hands see the idea of giving listeners what they want, when they want it, as a bit too commercially minded. Younger - who will be effective number two to BBC World Service managing director Bob Phillis - should be able to handle any flak. It runs in the family: his father was a former Labour MP and big wheel in Chatham House while his cousin, Royal Bank of Scotland chairman Lord Younger, is a former Tory cabinet minister.</p>

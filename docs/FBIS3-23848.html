Spirin, senior scientific associate of </F> the All-Russian Mechanization Institute, doctor of Agricultural  Sciences, professor, written down by I. Kalashnikov: "We Have  Conquered Erosion"]    [Text] This marks the 40th year since the start of  developing virgin and fallow lands. Whatever the evaluations of  this major national economic program, there is undoubtedly one:  putting into circulation vast, formerly unused, arable land made  a weighty addition of grain in the country's food product  balance. The approaching anniversary, therefore, deserves to be  noted on a broad scale. Our newspaper, too, proposes to publish  a number of items on this subject.    Today A.P. Spirin, senior scientific associate of the  All-Russian Mechanization Institute, doctor of Agricultural  Sciences, professor, tells us about the solution to one of the  very important problems--developing anti-erosion equipment,  without which all the efforts of the virgin soil subjugators  might have lost their value.    Anatoliy Petrovich noted: At the beginning of the 1950's,  our  country had vast areas of arable land, unused for a number of  reasons. This land was not only in Kazakhstan, where there were  many million hectares of virgin land (it was thought to be  mainly low-efficiency saline soil, and therefore was not  plowed). There were quite a few unplowed territories in Western  and Eastern Siberia, in Altay and in the Volga area, even on the  Kuban and in Rostov Oblast.    Calculations and estimates showed that these lands were over  20 million hectares in area. If an average of at least ten  quintals of grain per hectare were harvested, this promised an  addition of 20 million tonnes of grain a year. This would, of  course, be a major reserve for the production of grain, the  shortage of which we were already beginning to feel.    The country's government therefore devoted major attention  to  accelerated development of the virgin land. A great deal of  agricultural equipment was sent to Kazakhstan and to the eastern  regions, and thousands of machine operators went there. The epic  being lived through by the entire country began.    As far back as on the eve of developing these lands, expert  agrarian scientists gave notice in advance: the virgin land must  not be plowed with ordinary equipment -- there was a danger of  wind erosion. Here they alluded to the bitter experience of  countries such as the United States and Canada, which had  experienced the serious consequences of the dust storms of the  1930's. The only way to avoid misfortune was to use  non-terracing tilling of the soil in the steppe regions, where  strong winds blow. While traditional -- terrace -- plowing  deprives the earth of the protective plant covering,  non-terracing plowing keeps the stubble plant remnants on the  surface, which ensures reliable wind-erosion protection of the  soil.    World experience attested to this and taught this and also  the fact that a subsurface cultivator and other anti-erosion  equipment should be used instead of a plow. Unfortunately, we  did not have this equipment. We therefore had to till the earth  with ordinary machines in the early days. Fortunately, at first  we got by without dust storms. They soon made their presence  known, however.    The scientific institutions of those days, VASKhNIL  [All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences imeni V.I. Lenin],  including VIM [All-Union Agricultural Mechanization Scientific  Research Institute] and, in particular, our Department of  Agricultural Soil Protection Mechanization, worked persistently  on developing, in the shortest time possible, the machines and  implements that the virgin soil tillers needed. We all succeeded  in achieving the task successfully.    KPG-250, KPG-2-150 and KPP-2-2 type subsurface cultivators  were among the first implements built. They were quite simple  implements. What are they like? If you make a diagram, it is two  blades, placed at an angle (the so-called aperture angle, equal  to 110-120 degrees) and a post in the middle. Moreover, the  blades are slanted toward the plane of the earth -- this is the  crumbling angle or cutting angle. They made it possible to till  the soil to a depth of 25-27 centimeters, with a 1.5-2-meter  swath width. The special feature of the subsurface cultivator  lies in the fact that using them does not turn over the earth,  as occurs when plowing with a plow, and causes virtually no  destruction to the upper interwoven layer of the root system.  This, I repeat, protects the soil from wind erosion.    In addition to the subsurface cultivators, a number of other  machines were developed, which took into consideration the  specific nature and special features of non-terracing  technology. These are: the KSh rod weeder, the BI-3 toothed  harrow, stubble drills and snow plows. In all, the set of  anti-erosion equipment included 11 new descriptions of machines  and implements. VIM scientific associates A. Plishkin, V.  Trufanov and N. Ivanov did a great deal of fruitful work on  developing them in those years. The work was done with the  active participation of specialists of the design bureau of the  Odessa Agricultural Machine Plant imeni October Revolution.  Incidentally, it was at this same plant, which specializes in  the production of plows, that subsurface cultivators and other  means of mechanization for virgin land workers were developed  and produced for the first time.    At the same time, of course, foreign experience was taken  into consideration. There was no mere copying of foreign  equipment here, though. For instance, the American subsurface  cultivator was designed for fine tilling of the soil -- only  12-15 centimeters. In our country, considering the specific  nature of our soils, we hold the opinion: the deeper, the  better. Therefore we developed implements with deep tilling,  twice as deep as the American ones.    Furthermore, in those years the United States used wheeled  tractors, whereas we used mainly caterpillar tractors. Their  tractor-mounted implements could not be unitized with our  caterpillar tractors, which the designers also took into  consideration.    What can be said about the first-generation anti-erosion  machines? They were quite efficient, workable equipment, which  was widely used in various regions of the country. It made it  possible to introduce a soil-protection system of farming on an  area of over 20 million hectares, that is, on virtually all the  virgin land regions, and to stop wind erosion there. Moreover,  the use of these implements increased the grain crop yield by an  average of two to five quintals per hectare. This is because  preserving the plant remnants contributes to snow retention, and  consequently to increasing the moisture in the soil. The  developers of the equipment were awarded the Lenin Prize in 1972.    At the same time, the operation of the first subsurface  cultivators and other machines convinced us of the need for  their further improvement. As more and more new areas were  plowed, more productive and reliable equipment was required. In  addition to VIM, associates of the Special Design Bureau for  Anti-Erosion Equipment (GSKB PET), created in Tselinograd in  1965, with the participation of specialists from VISKhOM  [All-Union Agricultural Machine Building Scientific Research  Institute], VNIIZKh [All-Union Grain Farming Scientific Research  Institute] and KazNIIMESKh [Agricultural Mechanization and  Electrification Scientific Research Institute of the Northwest  USSR], were attached to the work. Through their joint efforts, a  set of second-generation machines, which included 20  descriptions, was successfully designed.    The farms of the virgin land regions began to receive the  KPSh-9 and KPSh-11 wide swath subsurface cultivators. Their  swath width is respectively 9 and 11 meters, which is several  times more than that of their predecessors. The output of  harrows, grain erosion drills, snowplow-swath collectors and  other machines distinguished by both high reliability and by a  wider swath, was also developed. For instance, the BMSh-15 and  BMSh-20 type harrow-hoes are capable of tilling a strip of land  15 and 20 meters wide.    The fact that, by that time high-power tractors such as the  T-150, K-700 and K-701 had been developed and produced,  contributed to widescale use of this powerful equipment. There  was no longer any need to use clumsy tractor hitches. Labor  productivity more than doubled.    The main result was that wind erosion was conquered. The  volume of soil-protective technology introduced rose  considerably. This made it possible to obtain an additional  13-15 million tonnes of grain a year. The group of scientists  and specialists -- the creators of the second-generation  machines and implements -- were awarded the State Prize in 1988.  Among them were L. Kim, A. Buryakov, A. Gribanovskiy, G. Kuzmin,  V. Suchkov and others.    Work is now continuing on improving the subsurface  equipment.  The task lies in creating ecologically safe, as specialists say,  agrophilic machines and implements. The adverse effect of their  working members on the soil should be minimal: they will  pulverize it less, better retain the plant remnants and pack it  down less.</p>

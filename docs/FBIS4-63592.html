			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] </F>   [Text] "Kiev's demand for annulling the Crimean  parliament's decision to restore the 1992 Constitution will  hardly solve the problem. It will only aggravate it. The best  thing would be to settle this conflict during talks between  delegations of the Ukrainian and Crimean parliaments," a  high-ranking Russian diplomat in charge of relations with  Ukraine told INTERFAX.    He believes that confrontation between Kiev and Simferopol  will play into the hands of the Ukrainian politicians who seek  momentary gains.    He is convinced that only a democratic procedure based on  the  CSCE principles will lead the conflict out of the deadlock.  "International relations must be based on what the peoples  consider correct and reasonable," he said.    President of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov stated that Crimea did not  doubt either Ukraine's territorial integrity, or the current  borders.    The Russian diplomat is convinced that the situation in  Crimea and in many other places of the former Soviet Union might  be eased by the introduction of dual citizenship in Ukraine.  "This is a vitally important issue. The Crimean residents I  have talked with assert that free choice of citizenship for  reasons of family circumstances would demonstrate Kiev's  sincerity and inspire hope for a better future," he said.    To quote the Russian diplomat, he would not like to speak or  think about "the worst variant" that might happen. "It's simply  awful and inadmissible. It would be madness," he said.    He also expressed hope that Kiev would not go beyond the  limits of common sense and stick to political methods.</p>

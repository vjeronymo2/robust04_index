			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRADLEY DROPS BID TO FINANCE TASK FORCE  </P> <P> Amid a swirl of questions about irregularities involving a city-supported trade  task force he has personally promoted for several years, Mayor Tom Bradley on  Friday abruptly withdrew his latest $121,000 funding request for the group.  </P> <P> The action came as state and federal officials indicated that the UCLA-based  Task Force for Africa-Los Angeles Relations, which has received nearly $400,000  from the city in recent years, has not had the nonprofit corporation status it  claimed in funding contracts with the city.  </P> <P> Also Friday, the city controller's office, citing the task force's failure to  file required spending records with the city, announced that it was launching  an audit to determine how taxpayer funds have been used.  </P> <P> The task force, which its officials said conducts trade missions, seminars and  other activities to promote business between Los Angeles and Africa, has come  under scrutiny as part of the recent controversy over Bradley's personal  financial ties with area firms that do business with the city. Bradley, who has  lobbied hard to obtain funding for the task force, is an investor in a  Riverside County land deal with the task force's $40,000-a-year director,  Juanita St. John.  </P> <P> The city attorney's office is probing the mayor's acceptance of tens of  thousands of dollars in fees from local financial institutions but refused  Friday to confirm or deny whether the inquiry would be expanded to include the  task force. However, Councilman Mike Woo, whose Governmental Operations  Committee is preparing its own review of Bradley's finances, said the task  force will be included in his committee's probe.  </P> <P> Bradley was on a trade mission in the Far East and could not be reached for  comment. But in the past, he has denied his personal lobbying efforts on behalf  of the task force -- calling council members to try to sway budget votes and in  1987 vetoing a council effort to cut the task force's funding -- constitute a  conflict of interest.  </P> <P> In a statement released Friday by his office, however, Bradley said some  questions recently raised about the task force "are still in the process of  being resolved."  </P> <P> "Under these circumstances, I have decided that it is in the best interests of  the city of Los Angeles to withdraw the funding request for the task force in  the 1989-90 Los Angeles city budget," Bradley said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nothing to Hide  </P> <P> St. John, in a telephone interview Friday evening, said she had nothing to hide  and would give the city any records it wants.  </P> <P> "I have filed exactly what they asked for," she said. "They never called me and  told me they wanted more."  </P> <P> It is difficult to say exactly what the task force's annual budget is because  it gets businesses to pick up some costs, St. John said. She said the city's  money has been used largely to pay her salary and for supplies.  </P> <P> She acknowledged that she let the group's state nonprofit status lapse. But she  said it was unnecessary because the task force is not collecting donations as a  charitable trust. While the Internal Revenue Service disagreed, she insisted  that the task force had the federal nonprofit recognition it needed.  </P> <P> As for Bradley's move to withdraw funding for the agency, St. John said she is  not bothered.  </P> <P> "The task force will continue, " she said.  </P> <P> Council hearings on that budget were scheduled to begin Monday. The mayor's  critics predicted that his request on behalf of the task force -- a 23%  increase over recent years -- would not survive.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Longtime Critic  </P> <P> Because the task force lacks official recognition as a nonprofit corporation,  Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, a longtime critic of the organization, said he may  push to recover the city funds.  </P> <P> "It appears they are in violation of their contract," Yaroslavsky said. "If  they are . . . they owe the city quite a bit of money."  </P> <P> In contracts with city in recent years, the task force has identified itself as  a "nonprofit corporation."  </P> <P> However, the state Franchise Tax Board said Friday the group's nonprofit  corporation status was suspended four years ago for failing to file a 1984 tax  return. Jim Rebar, a board spokesman, said the organization has not filed  returns since.  </P> <P> The IRS, which also approves nonprofit organizations, said its records show the  task force applied for that recognition, but it was never granted. Shirley  Nakagawa, an IRS spokeswoman, said it was not clear why.  </P> <P> The city's chief auditor, Tony De Guzman, said he hoped to begin delving into  the task force's financial matters Friday morning, but St. John canceled her  appointment, saying her husband was ill.  </P> <P> Asked about the city's apparent failure to demand required spending records or  check the nonprofit status, De Guzman said, "I don't know how it got through."  </P></p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tory seeks probe into Lloyd's A TORY backbencher yesterday supported Labour calls for a full public inquiry into alleged insider dealing, financial mismanagement and corruption at the Lloyd's of London insurance market. Mr Paul Marland, MP for Gloucestershire West, who is himself a Name, said that the sooner such a step was taken the better. 'The fact is we are investors and the market has been found seriously wanting,' he said. Mr Marland is a member of a number of syndicates managed by Rose Thomson Young and Gooda Walker, which are expected to produce some of the worst results in the insurance market for 1988, 1989 and 1990. His remarks came as other Conservative MPs responded furiously to suggestions made by Mr Peter Hain, the Labour MP for Neath, that the crisis at Lloyd's could result in the government losing its 21-strong Commons majority. Mr Hain said in an early day motion that this was because 23 Conservative MPs could face individual bankruptcy and disqualification as a result of their membership of catastrophe syndicates with losses totalling hundreds of millions of pounds. If 'even half' of the 23 - including several ministers - were indeed declared bankrupt, the government could lose its majority. It subsequently emerged that one of those referred to in the motion was no longer an MP. Several of those pinpointed by Mr Hain yesterday denied that they faced bankruptcy, while a number questioned either his motives or the accuracy of his information. Mr Archie Hamilton, a junior defence minister, dismissed any notion that he might be made bankrupt. 'The sort of money that I am losing is not something that would cause me serious financial embarrassment,' he said. Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, said the prospect of having to relinquish his seat for the reason suggested by Mr Hain was 'nil'. Mr Henry Bellingham, MP for Norfolk North West, attacked Mr Hain for publishing the motion, describing the action as 'a gross misuse of the Commons order paper'. He added: 'I am in no danger of going bankrupt.' Mr Winston Churchill, MP for Davyhulme, said: 'It is a very cheap party political publicity stunt. I am not on any syndicate that could be described as having catastrophic losses.' Lloyd's criticised Mr Hain's motion on the grounds of 'faulty methodology'. Lloyd's pointed out that Mr Hain did not take into account the fact that the 23 backbenchers he named are members of many other Lloyd's syndicates which will make profits in 1989 and 1990 as well as loss-making catastrophe reinsurance syndicates.</p>

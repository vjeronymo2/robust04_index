			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / The Week Ahead: Results due AMSTRAD, the consumer electronics group run by the ever-colourful Mr Alan Sugar, reports its full-year results tomorrow. The group, which reported a Pounds 71m loss last year, should have broken even at the trading level - but there may well be exceptional costs of about Pounds 25m mainly related to the closure of its Spanish operations. Most interest will be focused on the new corporate strategic plan which Amstrad's chairman has also promised to unveil and which will probably involve a move away from personal computers towards new growth areas like telecommunications products. The Amstrad board is also in the process of selecting a new chief executive. Tomorrow also sees the interim results of Silentnight Holdings. Projected profits of about Pounds 5m pre-tax will be an improvement on last time's Pounds 4.1m and will be thanks to the US and German operations performing better. Bank of Scotland reveals its interim figures on Wednesday. Estimates of pre-tax profits vary from Pounds 80m to Pounds 97m, up from last time's Pounds 74m. This would be in line with general banking industry trends, with levels of bad debt provisions falling. Its location has made it less exposed to the downturn in the London property market. Further vigorous growth is expected at Lloyds Chemists, the expanding retailing chemist which reports its final results on Thursday. Pre-tax profits as high as Pounds 50m are anticipated, compared with Pounds 36.9m last time. Also due on Thursday are the interim results of Etam, the clothing retailer. Forecasts range between Pounds 1.9m and Pounds 2.5m, against Pounds 1.7m in the previous first half. It is thought that both sales and margins will have held up well, though the seasonality of the business makes predictions untrustworthy. The interim dividend should rise to 1.75p (1.65p).</p>

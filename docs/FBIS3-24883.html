He is accused of initiating a five-day "illegal  strike" on 1 February. The SYNAPROF vice chairman, Mr. Mussa  Camara, told newsmen that the policemen who arrested Mr.  Nancassa did not have either a warrant or a legal notice.    The Criminal Investigations Department is also looking for  several other teachers who are on strike. The teachers are  accused of violating state security laws.    Education Minister Fernando Delfim da Silva announced on 1  February that he did not rule out the possibility of using  force, if need be, to stop the SYNAPROF strike, which he  describes as "illegal."    Teachers in Guinea-Bissau began a five-day strike on 1  February in response to a call by their union, SYNAPROF, for  better working conditions and an increase in their salary.</p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Dorrell defends taxation reforms Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, yesterday tried to regain the initiative in the debate over Tory taxation policy by arguing that the government had introduced tax reforms that improve economic efficiency. In a speech to the Tory Bow Group, Mr Dorrell attacked opposition criticisms that the government had harmed the economy by raising taxes. He claimed that Tory tax policy since 1979 had promoted economic efficiency by sharpening incentives and rewarding innovation and initiative. 'It is in the interests of all of us to structure the tax system so as to do minimum damage to the incentives to create wealth,' he said. 'That means shifting the balance of the tax burden from direct to indirect tax.' Mr Dorrell's speech follows a prolonged attack by Labour on tax increases and cuts in public spending announced in the last two Budgets. He focused on what he saw as three key improvements. He claimed that the government had sharpened incentives for workers by boosting the amount of marginal earnings kept after tax. He said an 18 per cent cut in the corporation tax rate had boosted business. Finally, he argued that the government had boosted incentives for savers by cutting marginal rates of tax on savings income and introducing tax incentives through the Pep and Tessa schemes. Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, yesterday hinted that the government's long-term reviews of public spending had not been implemented rigorously enough. Mr Lamont said: 'It is extremely important that these long-term reviews are carried out and are implemented.' He did not specify what areas of the public spending review he had in mind. Treasury officials say the review was used to structure spending for the social security, health and education departments and the Home Office in the last Budget.</p>

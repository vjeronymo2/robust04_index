			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / People: Smoke signals still unclear at BAT An American tobacco man will soon be back in the driving seat at Brown and Williamson, BAT Industries' large US tobacco business. Tommy Sandefur, 53, will take over as chairman and chief executive of Brown and Williamson when the current British incumbent, Ray Pritchard, retires at the end of March. Pritchard is the latest in a series of top BAT executives nearing retirement age. Brian Garraway, the deputy chairman, retired last October and Sir Patrick Sheehy, the chairman since 1982, is expected to retire in September when he will be 63. However, the latest reshuffle gives no clues as to who will take over from Sheehy. Sandefur, unlike Pritchard, will not have a seat on the BAT Industries board and most observers still think that Sheehy's successor will be drawn from a short list which includes Martin Broughton and Ulrich Herter, who head the two biggest parts of BAT's business - financial services and tobacco - and David Allvey, the finance director. Even so Sandefur will be one of BAT's two top executives in North America - an area which contributes two thirds of the group's profits. Brown and Williamson, based in Louisville, Kentucky, is the third biggest US cigarette company with sales of nearly Dollars 3.5bn. Its share of the US market, currently 11.1 per cent, has been rising and it has a growing export business, particularly in the Far East. Brands include Kool, Capri, Belai and Barclay. Sandefur is a tobacco man through and through. Born in Perry, Georgia, he worked for RJ Reynolds for 18 years and was executive vice president  - Europe, before joining Brown and Williamson as senior vice president of international marketing ten years ago. In January 1985, he was made president and chief operating officer. ***** Gateway, the troubled food retail group, has appointed Stan Frith as personnel director to replace Bryan Taker who left yesterday. It is the first appointment made by David Simons, who became chief executive of Isosceles, Gateway's parent, on January 4. Frith's career has spanned Texas Instruments and lately Bunzl. But it was his stint at House of Fraser, the department store group, which must have prompted this career move. Simons was finance director there. ***** Robert Watkins, Amstrad's technical director and one of seven main board members, has resigned. Amstrad made the announcement after the Stock Market closed yesterday and gave no explanation for the unexpected resignation. Watkins was unavailable for comment and Alan Sugar, the founder and chairman, was out of the office yesterday. Watkins was re-elected to the Amstrad board at the company's annual meeting in November - in the midst of Sugar's controversial 30p-a-share bid to take the group private again. Last month, in the wake of the shareholder rejection of Sugar's proposals, Watkins was one of two Amstrad directors to sell their stakes in the company; he sold his total holding of 563,500 shares at 23 1/8 p, raising Pounds 130,309 before costs. Meanwhile, Pro-Ned is due this week to provide Amstrad with a shortlist of candidates for two non-executive directorships.</p>

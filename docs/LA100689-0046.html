			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH: VIDEO . . . WHAT'S NEW;  </P> <P> AN OUTLET FOR HARD-TO-FIND SUPER-VHS TAPES;  </P> <P> VIDEO . . . WHAT'S NEW;  </P> <P> A NEW OUTLET FOR HARD-TO-FIND SUPER-VHS CASSETTES  </P> <P> If you've bought a Super-VHS videocassette recorder, you may have given up on  finding pre-recorded tapes in S-VHS. However, there are a few movies and other  programs you can buy in this sharper-picture tape format, if you know where to  look.  </P> <P> Where to look is Super Source, a San Francisco-based company that specializes  in Super-VHS tapes. The relatively new company doesn't have a lot to offer yet,  and you have to buy, not rent, but what it does have may be of interest.  </P> <P> Super Source offers these movies in S-VHS: "The Princess Bride" ($49.95),  "Blade Runner" ($59.95), "The Last Emperor" ($89.95), "On Golden Pond"  ($59.95), "RoboCop" ($89.95), "The Emerald Forest" ($49.95), "A Chorus Line"  ($49.95) and "White Mischief" ($49.95). Prices do not include postage.  </P> <P> There are also a few non-movie S-VHS tapes available, including some excellent  nature and travel programs. And in a week or two, the non-movie fare will  include "The Nutcracker," the first in a series of Bolshoi ballets digitally  recorded last spring. Hamilton Bryan, president of Super Source, says he is  also negotiating with film studios for more material, and hopes to announce a  multitape deal with a "mini-major" company soon.  </P> <P> Information on Super Source and a free catalogue: (800) 331-6304.  </P> <P> THIS WEEK'S MOVIES  </P> <P> Did it boost secretaries or knock them? That was the controversy over "Working  Girl" (CBS/Fox, $89.98, R), a sprightly and successful romantic comedy starring  Melanie Griffith, Sigourney Weaver, Harrison Ford and (especially winning as  the working girl's girlfriend) Joan Cusack. Mike Nichols directed.  </P> <P> Major-league baseball has almost wound down for the year, but you can rewind  and watch "Major League" (Paramount, no list price, R) as many times as you  like -- though you may cry "foul" if you expect this uneven comedy, starring  Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen, to be as good as "Bull Durham."  </P> <P> "The Dream Team" (MCA, $89.95, PG-13) isn't a baseball club. However, it is  made up of four mental patients who become separated from their doctor on the  way to a baseball game -- close enough. The comedy features a  just-before-"Batman" Michael Keaton.  </P> <P> "Criminal Law" (HBO, $89.99, R) features Gary Oldman and Kevin Bacon in a drama  about a defense attorney who finds out something disturbing about the client he  has helped clear of a murder charge.  </P> <P> "Checking Out" (Virgin Vision, $89.95, R) is a black comedy about a man (Jeff  Daniels) who drives everybody around him crazy because he's scared to death of  dying.  </P> <P> And video stores are stocking up for Halloween, including these new tapes:  "Fright Night Part II" (IVE, $89.95, R), the 1977 horror classic "Suspiria"  (Magnum, $89.98, a 92-minute R version and a 97-minute unrated version), "The  Return of Swamp Thing" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, PG-13) and "976-EVIL"  (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, R).  </P> <P> Vintage: "Bedtime Story" (MCA, $59.95) is the 1963 comedy about con men  starring Marlon Brando and David Niven that was remade last year as "Dirty  Rotten Scoundrels." "The Choirboys" (MCA, $79.95, R) is a 1977 drama about cops  in their off-hours; Robert Aldrich directed.  </P> <P> Reprices: " 'Crocodile' Dundee," "White Christmas," "The Red Shoes," "Ferris  Bueller's Day Off," "Big Top Pee-wee," "Charlotte's Web," "The Little Prince,"  "An Officer and a Gentleman" and "Popeye" are now $14.95 each.  </P> <P> OTHER NEW VIDEOS  </P> <P> One of video's favorite exercisers, Callan Pinckney, returns with the third in  her "Callanetics" series, "Beginning Callanetics" (MCA, $24.95). As the title  indicates, this 60-minute tape is a basic introduction to the low-impact  method. TERRY ATKINSON  </P></p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Management: Blasts of hot air help to clear the atmosphere - A US group's efforts to involve its workers At Bethlehem Steel's vast plant on the southern tip of Lake Michigan, a blast furnace worker is being rude about a foreman. A group of workers and managers listen as Brian Piers criticises the supervisor for acting as if he knows everything about steel-making. 'He's been here since the furnace was made of wood,' says Piers dryly. Such tension between workers and those in charge of them is common in any workplace. But the reason for Lee's remarks is exceptional: he has been asked to be offensive as part of a training course. The group of a dozen employees is halfway through a three-day course aimed at raising the involvement of workers in decision-making. Bethlehem Steel is one of many American companies now feeling their way towards new forms of work organisation. Its employee involvement programme at the Burns Harbor plant is part of a broad attempt to push down the level at which decisions are taken and free workers from a traditional model of overbearing management control. The experiment is not the most radical in American workplaces. Car making is one industry which has moved swiftly towards team working and employee involvement. Companies such as General Motors have been pushed into experiments including one at the Saturn plant in Tennessee by the salutary example of Japanese working methods. But Bethlehem's smaller-scale effort is notable in two ways. It is ironic because Bethlehem Steel was one of the first companies in which traditional working practices were developed 80 years ago. And despite some unions' suspicion of employee involvement programmes, this one is being jointly run with the United Steel Workers of America. The USW has proved a tough adversary for the American steel makers in the past. It has achieved high wages for its members and was criticised as intransigent and short-sighted by Sir Robert Scholey, chairman of British Steel, when negotiations over a joint venture between the two companies collapsed last November. But the union is enthusiastic about the employee involvement venture despite some initial misgivings. 'It is a dramatic change for us,' says Paul Gipson, president of the USW local branch. 'It does not take us away totally from the adversarial picture, but it certainly gives us a lot more participation in decision-making.' On the company's side, there were also early fears about the idea. 'If you had told a steel executive in the 1940s about something like this, he would have said it was communism,' says Gary DeHart, the plant's human resources manager. But he believes it has already helped to raise the company's profitability and production quality. This has not been achieved without difficulty. Employee involvement was introduced in the 1988 wage deal as part of a complex profit-sharing arrangement. But the formula was abandoned last year after a series of disputes and the employee involvement programme was left to carry on without being linked to workers' pay. All the plant's 4,600 hourly-paid workers are to attend a three-day course in employee involvement and team working by 1993. The company and the union have established 42 problem-solving teams throughout the plant. The teams include management and union representatives as well as workers from each unit and department. The aim is simple, according to Bill Brooks, the management co-ordinator of the programme. 'We did not have people who could sit down together and talk. That was our starting point,' he says. 'We had people who would even go to great lengths to avoid seeing each other physically.' Such a manoeuvre is possible in many parts of the three-and-a-half mile long plant. Built in 1962, it is Bethlehem's newest integrated plant and one of its most profitable. Despite the contraction of the steelmaking plants in Pennsylvania during the 1980s, Bethlehem made Dollars 800m of capital improvements to Burns Harbor. Burns Harbor is one of five plants lining the shore of Lake Michigan, which produce about 20 per cent of America's steel. Two-thirds of the sheet steel from Burns Harbor is for the automotive industry, and the rest goes to consumer and office products. Its plate steel is mostly used for railways and shipbuilding. Brooks and John Greaves, the programme's union co-ordinator, share an office. As if to emphasise the joint nature of the enterprise, it is arranged symmetrically. Above Brooks' desk is a Bethlehem Steel pennant, above Greaves' a USW pennant. Between the two is a poster of a common cause: the Chicago Bears football team. The two men administer the programme and the training sessions in which workers are taught about new approaches to management which try to engage the commitment and participation of the whole workforce. 'It is easier to have an adversarial relationship. This way is better but it is tough to make it work,' says Brooks. There is a considerable irony here, for it was at Bethlehem Steel at the turn of the century that Frederick Taylor developed his theories of scientific management. Taylor's ideas about not allowing workers autonomy and controlling work strictly helped to develop the traditional assembly line in many US companies. In the training room opposite the office, a training session is in progress. The trainer is Marty Marciniak, a former machine shop worker. He is asking questions and cajoling the group of 10 workers, surrounded by posters with slogans such as 'The best decisions will result when they are made at the lowest practical level'. Part of the involvement programme is a suggestions scheme, which now draws about 200 suggestions a month. The programme costs about Dollars 950,000 a year to run, but the company estimates that it made a net saving of Dollars 3.4m dollars from the scheme in 1989, apart from the improvements in efficiency from greater co-operation. Although the average age of workers at Burns Harbor is 42, the plant has a relatively young and well-educated workforce for the steel industry because it was built in the 1960s. 'We have no burden of history. They were all brand new when they started, and they do not talk about the labour battles of the 1930s,' says DeHart. That was one advantage in starting the employee involvement programme. Another was the plant's profitability, according to Gipson of the USW. 'It think it is unique that we were not forced into it by the need to make money. We wanted to make the plant more comfortable rather than more profitable,' he says. The employee involvement process is at a relatively early stage, and is being used to influence worker attitudes rather than change working practices. Even this degree of co-operation scares some managers, according to DeHart. 'For managers who are used to the control mode, it is a very frightening thing,' he says. But he believes the company is now committed to developing the process. 'You go through an early cosmetic phase when managers still make decisions although they pretend to discuss them, but the evolution is inexorable,' he says 'Soon you are no longer pretending and the workers are really part of the process.'

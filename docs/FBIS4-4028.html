			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Japan's socialists quit  the ruling coalition on Tuesday [26 April], NHK Public  Television said.    The socialists' move is plunging Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata's government into crisis just hours after they helped to  elect him.    Hata is expected to form his new cabinet on Monday after  winning a parliamentary vote earlier in the day.</p>

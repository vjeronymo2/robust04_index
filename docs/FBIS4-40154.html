			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer Yevgeniy Grachev] The main news drawing  everyone's attention abroad is the statement by the Foreign  Ministry of North Korea on the pullout of the DPRK from the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. The Agency monitors  how the non- proliferation treaty is being observed. The  statement was the subject of numerous telephone conversations  between heads of states and governments. One such conversation  took place between the Russian and U.S. Presidents. But the  most interesting thing is that 24 hours after its statement on  withdrawing from the IAEA, North Korea has sent no official  notification about it to anybody as yet. We have already  reported this in our Mayak Panorama. And now the report has set  us wondering how this situation has arisen. I would like to put  this question to my colleague, observer Vladimir Pasko.    [Pasko] You know, Yevgeniy Tikhonovich, this is not the only  puzzling thing. Having announced its withdrawal from the IAEA,  Pyongyang let it be known at the same time that it had not yet  left the non-proliferation treaty. I will remind you that last  year during a very similar conflict with the IAEA over  inspections, Pyongyang was so careless as to state that it  intended to pull out of the treaty. But having seen what  reaction that decision had provoked, Pyongyang realized that it  had gone too far and backtracked, saying that it would suspend  its decision. So, now it has confirmed that that formula  continues [two-second break in transmission] without stepping  over the line which must not be crossed. But at the same time  it has been loudly stating that it would not allow any unjust  inspections of its nuclear sites.    [Grachev] In other words, as I understand it, Pyongyang is  now in limbo, as it were. It is both party to the treaty and  yet it does not subscribe to it.    [Pasko] All this, in my view, is just a publicity game, what  is more, it is a publicity stunt for the benefit of the  domestic, North Korean audience, since these verbal histrionics  will mislead nobody else. Representatives of the IAEA said that  they believe North Korea to be party to the non-proliferation  treaty, and that as this is the case it is obliged to abide by  all the requirements which are imposed on it by the treaty,  including inspection of its nuclear sites for collecting  information about the North Korean nuclear program. Pyongyang  is refusing to let the inspectors in, while the IAEA, because of  the absence of the information, is refusing to confirm that  North Korea is not engaged in developing nuclear weapons.    [Grachev] You know, judging by the publications which I have  read, nothing is clear.    [Pasko] You know, the argument over inspection is  nevertheless of fundamental importance. If Pyongyang triumphs  in this argument, it will set a precedent for others to start  refusing inspection, and yet the IAEA is the only body guarding  the non-proliferation treaty. To undermine its authority is  tantamount to sawing off the branch on which one is sitting.    [Grachev] Then the question is how the DPRK can be made to  comply with the IAEA's demands.    [Pasko] You know, sanctions are not out of the question. But  a number of countries believe that there is no rush here.  Pyongyang has been cunningly playing on this. Curiously, the  statement in question was made prior to the meeting of the  Security Council which must discuss the report by the IAEA and  its decisions to stop technical aid to the DPRK. It is possible  that the Council will raise the issue of sanctions. In its  statement, Pyongyang reduces the essence of the argument with  the IAEA to the issue of inspection, implying that this is too  trifling a crime for a punishment as severe as sanctions.    [Grachev] That is not a trifling matter.    [Pasko] Some think, whether you want it or not, that this  behavior means that Pyongyang keeps the door ajar for dialogue.  But one cannot help seeing that the bargaining campaign which  Pyongyang whipped up around inspection is fundamentally  impermissible. The non-proliferation treaty is not an object  for bargaining or exploitation. It can only be observed, and  observed without reservations. All games must be stopped, in my  view, in the most determined way.    [Grachev] Absolutely. All this is connected with nuclear  weapons. Of course, things are too serious to start political  games, you will agree. But I nevertheless think that sanctions  are not the only measure that can be taken by the Security  Council. I think the proposal made recently by Moscow on  convening an international conference on nuclear-free status for  the Korean peninsula must not be forgotten.    [Pasko] Of course, this proposal cannot be ignored. But it  must not be mixed up with the question of compliance with the  treaty on implementation of the IAEA's requirements. North  Korea says it is against the idea of its argument with the IAEA  being resolved collectively. It demands talks solely with the  United States [two- second break in transmission].    [Grachev] Many believe that they [as heard] will be  continued. We have received a report from Japan today from  which it is clear that the temperature of the water is being  sounded. How will Americans react to such proposals? The  Americans have thus said nothing. But I would like to note that  proposals by Moscow seem to have been adopted by Pyongyang in  recent days. Nevertheless I would like to draw your attention  to the following: The issue of the argument with the IAEA seems  to be akin to that of a conference on nuclear-free status for  the Korean peninsula. Nevertheless they are not the same.    [Pasko] Indeed, they are not the same. I would like to  remind our listeners that this was an opinion of our observer  Vladimir Pasko.</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / International Company News: Canada oil group to be privatised THE CANADIAN government expects to proceed in mid-June with the first phase of privatising Petro-Canada, the country's biggest domestically-owned oil company. The PetroCan privatisation is the biggest so far in the programme started seven years ago by the government of Mr Brian Mulroney. Based on a preliminary prospectus filed late last week, analysts predict that the public offering of a 15 per cent stake in PetroCan will raise close to CDollars 500m (USDollars 434m). Foreigners can subscribe for up to 25 per cent of the issue, but no shareholder will be permitted to own more than a 10 per cent stake. Investors will be required to buy at least 50 shares. Small investors who apply before June 14 for between 50 and 250 shares will be given priority. RBC Dominion Securities is the lead underwriter. Analysts expect that, if only for political reasons, the issue will be priced attractively, about CDollars 15 a share, well below the company's net asset value. The preliminary prospectus was accompanied by an announcement that PetroCan suffered a CDollars 52m first-quarter loss, compared with profits of CDollars 40m a year earlier. The loss was blamed mainly on low refining margins and a CDollars 14m restructuring charge. PetroCan was created in 1975 to give Ottawa a window on the energy industry. Much of its growth came from the acquisition of Canadian assets from foreign oil companies, including Atlantic Richfield, Petrofina and BP. Assets were CDollars 7.3bn at the end of last year.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UN plans peace force for Krajina UN commanders yesterday discussed plans for the deployment of peacekeepers along the 1,000-mile confrontation line between Croatian and Serb forces in the breakaway state of Krajina after the two sides signed a ceasefire agreement. International mediators see the agreement as a key step towards hammering out an overall settlement in the Balkans. It marked the formal end to the six-month war in 1991, when Serb forces carved out their own state in Krajina in defiance of Croatian independence. But peace mediators made clear that agreement would pave the way for peace in the region, only if it were followed by economic and political accords on the status of Krajina, which cuts Croatia in two. Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian special envoy to former Yugoslavia, said it was 'only a beginning of the road toward peace and normalisation of relations between Serbs and Croats'. After 18 hours of talks, and considerable pressure from the Russian, US, UN and EU envoys, the two sides endorsed 35 maps determining the frontlines in Croatia. The agreement calls for a ceasefire to come into force on April 4 and the withdrawal of heavy weapons 20km from the confrontation lines by April 5.</p>

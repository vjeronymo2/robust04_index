			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Move to uphold training pledge MRS Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, yesterday introduced measures to uphold the government's guarantee of a training place for all unemployed young people. The employment department will contract with each Training and Enterprise Council for a specific number of training places. If demand is higher, the department will look again at the funding. Previously Tecs had a more open-ended contract in which they agreed to uphold the guarantee. The Labour party will today publish its survey of careers services and the numbers of youngsters it claims will be unable to gain a place after leaving school this summer.</p>

			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Yeltsin hint of new economic course President Boris Yeltsin yesterday foreshadowed a shift in Russian economic policy away from fighting inflation in favour of more emphasis on investment and production. The Russian leader said the large vote won by the neo-fascist Liberal Democratic Party of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky was 'a vote against poverty' by those on low incomes. 'Do not forget the poor, there are many of them,' Mr Yeltsin said while touring a building exhibition. Later, Mr Yeltsin told the presidential council of advisers he intended to 'co-operate constructively' with the new parliament - without specifying with which parties he meant to work. Council members said the president wanted the reforms to take on 'a more social orientation', Itar Tass news agency reported. Presidential aides said a struggle was going on last night over whether the president should use a press conference today to say he is ready to work with 'constructive' forces in the new parliament - but it is not clear whether this term will include Mr Zhirinovsky's party, or only the four reformist parties. The Interfax news agency reported that Mr Zhirinovsky held a long conversation on Monday night with Mr Nikolai Medvedev, Mr Yeltsin's head of administration - a sign that Mr Yeltsin is anxious to explore all options. The new parliament is unlikely to have a majority for either pro- or anti-reform parties as there will be around 140 independent deputies. However, it is likely the anti-reformers will be the largest single bloc - and the signs were yesterday that they are trying to work together. Mr Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist party, the third largest bloc in the lower house, said yesterday he was ready to work with any party which 'struggles for the integrity of our country, peace and well-being of every family'. He said he did not believe the Liberal Democrats were a fascist party, and said the formation of an anti-fascist front, proposed by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, would lead only to civil war. Mr Yeltsin's comments on the poor came after an indication from Mr Gaidar that he would consider moving the government's priorities away from fighting inflation to increasing investment and raising production. This in turn followed comments by Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, that the strategy of fighting inflation associated with Mr Gaidar had failed and that he 'had better think again'. Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister in charge of foreign economic relations, said yesterday many underutilised resources could be brought into production without increasing inflation. 'That means of course choosing which enterprises to support, rather than supporting all even if they are on the verge of bankruptcy,' he said.</p>

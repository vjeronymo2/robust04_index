			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Commerzbank advances 52% in 10 months Commerzbank, the smallest of Germany's big three banks, yesterday reported operating profits up by 52 per cent to DM909m (Dollars 535m) in the 10 months ended October. The sharp increase, driven largely by a near trebling in profits from securities trading, is likely to be followed by profits increases from other German banks as they report their figures over the next two weeks. It is likely that 1993 will be another record year for the German banking sector, showing the extent to which Germany's banking sector has remained immune to the country's recession, in spite of mounting credit risks. Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, the bank's chief executive, gave a strong hint that the profits performance would be reflected in a dividend increase going beyond what would be necessary to give shareholders the benefit of this year's lowering of corporate tax rates to 30 per cent from 36 per cent. 'We are fairly confident that this will be possible,' Mr Kohlhaussen said. But he added that no final decision had been taken. His remarks raise the possibility of a payout of DM12 per share, up from DM10 last year. A DM1 increase in the dividend would compensate for the tax change. He said the bank would soon be holding a capital raising issue. He did not clarify when, how or how much would be raised. He said the money was necessary to bring core capital, the basis for future lending growth, from 4.6 per cent to 5 per cent of total assets. Earlier this year, the bank held a DM500m equity rights issue and a DM800m issue of profits-sharing certificates with warrants attached. The increase in profits was in part due to a cut in provisions for bad and doubtful debts by 21 per cent to DM1.37bn, reflecting lower provisions against sovereign debt risks. The operating result benefited from DM229m of other income - income from the sale of real estate and income from leased equipment. Profits from securities trading rose to DM475m from DM163m, and buoyant fixed income, equity and derivatives markets helped commission income rise by 26 per cent to DM1.55bn. Profits on interest income, from mainstream lending business, rose by 9.2 per cent to DM3.89bn in spite of a modest 2.1 per cent increase in total lending. Commerzbank shares, which have outperformed the steeply rising German market by 15 per cent this year, rose marginally yesterday against the market trend, closing 50 pfennigs higher at DM363.</p>

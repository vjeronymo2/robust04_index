			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: Finns in talks over Tampella purchase A GROUP of five leading Finnish industrial companies is in talks which may lead to the purchase of forest industry and engineering company Tampella, Reuter reports from Helsinki. The five companies are Ahlstrom, Enso-Gutzeit, Valmet, Outokumpu and Repola, according to Mr Krister Ahlstrom, Ahlstrom chairman 'We are very early in negotiations. We can't be more specific,' he said. Mr Heikki Hakala, Repola executive vice-president, said: 'It is very difficult for me to comment . . . I know that there are some discussions but I don't know more.' Valmet, Outokumpu and Enso declined to comment and there was no immediate comment from Tampella. Tampella was formerly about 60 per cent owned by SkopBank, the Finnish savings bank of which the Bank of Finland took administrative control in September. The central bank set up a series of holding companies to remove risks from SkopBank's balance sheet. One holding company, Solidium, acquired 66.1 per cent of Tampella. The five companies had been in talks with Solidium, according to Mr Ahlstrom. He said one of the problems to be discussed is Tampella's debt. SkopBank last month said it had foregone claims on Tampella of about FMk1.5bn (Dollars 350m). Tampella said Solidium would buy loans to Tampella from SkopBank of FMk3.25bn. Solidium turned FMk530m of this into new Tampella capital.</p>

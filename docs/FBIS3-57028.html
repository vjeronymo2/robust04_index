According to the communique, "the sides will withdraw all  armed units with arms and military hardware from the Inguri  river and other possible lines of active confrontation within  five days after the arrival of the peace-keeping force.... At  the same time, international observers and peace-keeping troops  will move into the areas from which armed units are withdrawn."    The communique pointed out that both the Georgian and  Abkhazian sides "have recognised that the main task is to  achieve a full-scale political settlement of the conflict, and  all efforts should be concentrated on attaining this goal."  They agreed to continue the discussion of the problem of  Abkhazia's political status, taking into account the interests  of both sides. The next meeting of experts on this issue will  be held in Moscow on February 8.    Following the adoption of the Geneva communique, Georgia  asked to convene the Security Council for discussing a  possibility of sending a U.N. peace-keeping force to the area of  the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict.</p>

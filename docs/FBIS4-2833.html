			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 13 Apr (XINHUA) -- Tang Shubei, executive  vice president of the Association for Relations Across the  Taiwan Strait [ARATS], met with Shi Qiping [Shih Chi-ping],  deputy secretary general of the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF]  based in Taiwan, on the afternoon of 12 April. They discussed  and reached three points of common understanding on the  pleasure-boat fire incident in the Qiandao Hu. They are:  First, at present, it is necessary to make all efforts to speed  up the investigation of the Qiandao Hu incident and to publish  the cause as soon as possible; second, the two organizations  agree in principle that they exchange opinions on incidents  involving the lives and damage to property of compatriots of the  two sides; and third, both organizations should do all they can  within their respective authority to clear up the negative  effects of the incident.    According to a briefing, Tang Shubei told Shi Qiping: While  contacts and exchanges between compatriots of the two sides are  growing daily, we are profoundly saddened by the Qiandao Hu  incident, which, to our great sorrow, resulted in the deaths of  24 Taiwan compatriots, who had come to the mainland for  sightseeing, and eight mainland compatriots. On behalf of the  ARATS, he grieved for the victims and asked Mr. Shi to once  again convey deep condolences to their families after he went  back to Taibei [Taipei].    Tang Shubei said: Leaders of the CPC Central Committee and  the State Council have paid close attention to the incident.  They promptly instructed the Zhejiang Provincial CPC Committee  and the provincial people's government to rush to rescue  victims, to properly deal with the aftermath, and to step up  efforts to investigate the cause of the incident. The State  Council Taiwan Affairs Office, the Public Security and  Communications Ministries, the National Tourism Administration,  the Zhejiang provincial and Hangzhou city governments, and other  relevant departments went into action immediately. Recently,  leaders of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council again  ordered the Zhejiang CPC Committee and the government to make  all efforts to speed up the investigation of the cause while  earnestly dealing with the incident's aftermath. Should the  involvement of external forces be discovered and verified, it is  imperative to harshly punish them regardless of who was  involved. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council also  instructed the perimeter provinces and cities to actively  cooperate with the work conducted in Zhejiang. Tang Shubei  said: In the course of handling the incident, the Zhejiang  departments concerned did all they could to respect the wishes  of the bereaved families and to provide them with all kinds of  help; and explained to them why some things could not be done  because of the limitation of local conditions. We should say  that the mainland has paid close attention to promptly dealing  with the aftermath.    Tang Shubei said: In the process of handling the incident,  ARATS, in the spirit of assisting relevant departments to deal  with problems arising from exchanges between compatriots of the  two sides and of safeguarding the lawful rights and interests of  compatriots of the two sides, has actively cooperated with and  assisted the competent authorities to promptly deal with the  incident. It also dispatched its deputy secretary general, Liu  Gangqi, to visit the incident site to help deal with relevant  matters. ARATS immediately contacted the SEF to inform it of  its handling of the incident, and did so in the capacity of a  nongovernment organization.    Tang Shubei emphatically said: Taiwan compatriots' lives,  property, and security are safeguarded on the mainland. State  law protects Taiwan compatriots the same way as mainlanders, and  there is definitely no such problem as discrimination. The  unfortunate mishap [shi gu 0057 2399] on Qiandao Hu was an  unexpected incident in the contacts and exchanges between  compatriots of the two sides of the strait, and it cannot  possibly, and should not, influence the development of relations  between the two sides; still less should it be turned into an  incident of a "political nature." We hope that Taiwan  compatriots and concerned departments in Taiwan will look at the  mishap objectively and calmly. As soon as the truth of the case  is found, ARATS will inform the SEF as quickly as possible in an  appropriate way.    Tang Shubei said: Incidents that harm the normal rights and  interests of compatriots of the two sides of the Strait,  including incidents that cause serious threat to lives and  property of compatriots of the two sides, have happened in the  past. ARATS always holds that those incidents should be solved  promptly through negotiations between the ARATS and SEF.  Concerning the SEF proposal on "discussing matters on  safeguarding people's lives, property, and security," Tang  Shubei said that, through preparations, the two organizations  could and should exchange opinions on the issue of harm to  lives, property, and security of compatriots of the two sides of  the Strait.    Tang Shubei also said: The economic and trade exchanges and  contacts between people of the two sides are good things that  are beneficial to the development of relations between the two  sides, because compatriots on both sides will benefit through  those exchanges and contacts. We do not want the development of  relations between the two sides to be obstructed by the Qiandao  Hu mishap, still less let one side use this unexpected incident  to limit and stop contacts between the two sides and put  pressure on the other side. ARATS noticed that in the course of  handling this unexpected incident, some of the views in Taiwan  tended to go to extremes and we are understandable in regard to  this matter. However, it should be pointed out that a very  small number of people attacked and even slandered the mainland  in an unbridled way. This will only increase distrust between  compatriots of the two sides and deteriorate the hard-earned  relations between the two sides of the strait. Regarding this  point, it is hoped that the SEF will ask concerned departments  in Taiwan to pay attention to the matter.    Tang Shubei also pointed out: Prior to clearly finding out  and announcing the truth of the mishap, using guesswork to  spread rumors that the mainland is hiding the truth is totally  groundless. As to dependents of Taiwan compatriots who were  killed in the mishap and concerned departments in Taiwan holding  different views regarding the handling of the mishap by the  concerned local departments, a responsible person of the State  Council's Taiwan Affairs Office said in his talk on 9 April that  it is believed that the broad masses of Taiwan compatriots will  understand the measures taken and efforts made by concerned  departments on the mainland in handling the mishap. Meanwhile,  we are also willing to hear positive suggestions and opinions  from all sides, including those from Taiwan compatriots.    In yesterday's meeting, Mr. Shi Qiping also expressed the  SEF's opinions to Tang Shubei.</p>

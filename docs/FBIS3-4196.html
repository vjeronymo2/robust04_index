According to Ms. Peng, China is seeing over 20 million  births  annually with a net growth in the country's population of about  14 million, causing the absolute number of births in the country  to still remain very large and putting a heavy burden on the  country.    Ms. Peng said that since there was a big gap between the  state family planning policy and the desire for having children  by farmers, the policy on family planning in the country was  being carried out mainly through powerful executive measures and  if there was any relaxation in this sector, the birth rate would  soon deteriorate further.    The country has seen a serious problem in imbalance in the  control of population growth in the country with  children-bearing women in the 7 provinces and autonomous regions  of Jiangxi, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Tibet, Ningxia and  Xinjiang to be in their peak birth state between 1997 and 2000.  The country is, according to Ms. Peng, aso facing arduous tasks  in the raising of the quality of population. The country now  has 51.64 million disabled people, accounting for 2.4 percent of  its total population, the disabled at the age of 0 to 14 years  make up 3.66 percent of the total of the same age group, 65.96  percent of whom are suffering from a mental problem. The rate  of physical defects in newly-born babies is 1.3 percent of the  total births in the country with Shanxi having a rate of 2  percent, ranking the province first in the country. There are  400 million people living in areas with an iodine-shortage  problem, making up 40 percent o the total population facing the  same problem in the world. Illiterate and semi-illiterate  people in the country are now put at over 180 million with  females accounting for 70 percent, posing a problem for the  control of population growth and the raising of quality of  people.    In addition, there are many problems in the population  structure with boy births far exceeding those of girls. Owing  to the drop in births and increasing life-span, China will enter  peak aging society in the next century.</p>

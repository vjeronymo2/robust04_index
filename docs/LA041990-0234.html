			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. ANNOUNCES PLANS TO PULL 15,000 TROOPS OUT OF ASIA  </P> <P> The Bush Administration today announced plans to withdraw up to 15,000 U.S.  troops from Asia within three years and more later, turning the lead defense  role in South Korea over to Korean forces by the end of the century.  </P> <P> But Undersecretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz said the troop levels will be cut  cautiously to avoid sending "a false and dangerous signal," particularly to  North Korea, of U.S. withdrawal from Asia.  </P> <P> Wolfowitz told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the Administration  plans to cut 7,000 U.S. troops from the 44,400 in South Korea over the next  three years, 5,000 to 6,000 from the 50,000 in Japan and 2,000 from the 14,800  in the Philippines.  </P></p>

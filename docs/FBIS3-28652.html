			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Feb 9 (OANA-ANTARA) -- The visit by Taiwan  President Li Teng-hui to Indonesia will in no way change  Indonesia's line of one china policy, said Foreign Ministers Ali  Alatas. "President Li Teng-hui's visit will not change a bit of  our policy of one China. We retain the line," he said here on  Tuesday.    He was commenting on the protests forwarded by Beijing and  circles concerned here on a planned meeting between Taiwan  President Li Teng-hui and President Suharto in Bali later this  week. The circles expressed their concern that such a meeting  could destabilize the relations between Indonesia and China.    "Li Teng-hui's visit to Bali is only an informal one. He is  on vacation in Bali. There is nothing deviated from Indonesia's  stance on having only trade relations with Taiwan," he said.    He noted that there is no need for the public to worry that  Indonesia will change its one China policy. "Foreign Ministry  has given necessary explanation to Chinese ambassador here and  our staffs in Beijing did so to the Chinese Government. There is  no need to exagerate such a meeting as both leaders will meet in  their own personal capacity. Li's meeting with Minister of  Research and Technology B.J. Habibie is also a kind of two  scientists' meeting," he said.    Asked about the possibility of Taiwan's presence in APEC  leaders' informal meeting here next November, Alatas said that  the procedure of organizing the summit meeting of APEC leaders  will be the same as that of in Seattle, the United States, last  November. "Jakarta's meeting next November will be the same as  that of one in Seattle. It'll be still a informal one. Hong  Kong and Taiwan will be represented by their ministers, he said.</p>

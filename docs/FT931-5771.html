			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Observer: Well oiled Members of the New York Mercantile Exchange had been looking forward to getting tanked up at this evening's 10th anniversary gala in the Waldorf-Astoria. Deservedly so, too, since crude oil futures now trade almost as much in a day as they did in a whole year at the start, and the exchange sets world prices for natural gas and other energy products as well as crude oil products. Alas, a pall has been cast over the proceedings by the bomb at the World Trade Centre, which crippled the trading floor. Although Nymex has kept open for a short working day throughout this week, traders have been growing unusually hot under the collar with the air-conditioning yet to be restored. Meanwhile chairman Lou Guttman, working round the clock, has had to abandon active campaigning for the mid-March election in which he has been hoping to secure a third term. Already fighting federal charges that he violated commodity trading regulations in 1989, he must be re-reading Murphy's law.</p>

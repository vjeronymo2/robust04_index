			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 27 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa on Thursday [27 January] denied opposition allegations  that the government's bill to revamp the system for electing  Diet members is secretly aimed at slashing the parliamentary  strength of opposition parties.    "Our efforts to attain reform are not aimed at causing a  power struggle or horse-trading among political parties or  factions," Hosokawa told a meeting of the Committee for the  Promotion of Political Reforms, a private panel of business  executives, academics and journalists.    His remarks came in response to opposition attacks on his  plan to replace the current 511-member House of Representatives  with a 500-seat mixture of single-seat constituencies and  proportional representation as favoring the coalition partners,  especially Shinseito [Japan Reneewal Party] and Komeito.    Hosokawa told the meeting, "I will not remain prime minister  for a minute if political reform is not achieved." The remark  was immediately taken as implying his readiness to disband the  cabinet and resign if he fails to secure the opposition Liberal  Democratic Party's consent to hammer out a compromise version of  his reform package.    Minutes after the meeting, however, Hosokawa recanted his  statement, telling reporters in the premier's official  residence, "I only uttered something as a matter of course as a  general statement."    "I am not thinking of dissolving the House of  Representatives  for a general election or of disbanding my cabinet," Hosokawa  said.    The meeting was called two days before the current Diet  session is to close on Saturday -- Hosokawa's self-imposed  deadline for pushing his package through the Diet.</p>

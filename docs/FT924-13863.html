			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / International Company News: Westinghouse hit by Dollars 155m provision WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the US conglomerate, yesterday turned in third-quarter net income of Dollars 14m, or zero cents a share, on essentially flat revenues of Dollars 3.4bn, reflecting a sharp drop in order rates and a big provision largely for losses related to an investment in Phar-Mor. The Dollars 155m pre-tax third-quarter provision included Dollars 100m for the Phar-Mor investment, and covered increased credit reserves and valuation allowances at Westinghouse Financial Services. A year earlier, Westinghouse had a third-quarter net loss of Dollars 1.48bn, or Dollars 4.86 a share, including charges of Dollars 1.68bn. On Wall Street, Westinghouse shares closed unchanged at Dollars 14 5/8 . The results were released after the close of trading, and the stock was unavailable for late NYSE trading. Analysts had expected third-quarter earnings to fall below second-quarter levels of 35 cents a share, but the erosion was greater than expected.</p>

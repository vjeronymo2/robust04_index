			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rally amid hopes of US spending curbs AFTER Friday's interruption, longer-dated US Treasury prices resumed their rally yesterday after sentiment was boosted by reports that President Bill Clinton is planning more spending cuts than he originally announced in his first budget. Late profit-taking, however, wiped out more than half of the market's early gains. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/16 at 105 3/16 , yielding 6.715 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was lower, down  1/8 at 99 27/32 , to yield 3.944 per cent. Although prices fell sharply on Friday morning following a much stronger-than-expected February employment report, by the end of the day they had regained much of their lost ground, an indication of the resilience of market sentiment. It was no surprise, therefore, when bonds opened strongly yesterday. Dealers attributed the buying to weekend press and television reports suggesting that the White House is considering bowing to the wishes of Congressional Democrats and adding new spending cuts to its budget plans. The reports bolstered investors' belief that President Clinton has the courage and political support to take a tough anti-deficit policy stance. Prices were also helped by a continued shifting of funds into Treasuries by holders of mortgage-backed securities, and by comments from Mr Roger Altman, the deputy treasury secretary and key economic adviser to the president, who said that the government should be wary about 'going overboard' with its planned economic stimulus, given the latest jobs data. Later in the day, however, the long end gave back some of its gains as dealers and investors took the opportunity to book some profits. THE higher-yielding European government bond markets showed further strong gains yesterday, continuing the outperformance seen since the Bundesbank's announcement on Friday that its key money market rate was to be cut by a quarter of a point. Spanish and Danish bonds have led the rally, as pressure within the European exchange rate mechanism has eased. Ten-year Danish bond yields stood 185 basis points above those on German government bond before the Bundesbank's announcement; by yesterday evening, they had narrowed sharply to 155 basis points. 'People are looking for the right time to move out of bunds and into markets like Spain and Denmark,' said Mr Jouni Kokko, an analyst at Warburg Securities in London. However, Mr Richard Gray, of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said the rally was more likely to reflect a shift by fund managers out of cash. Friday's US employment report and Bundesbank announcement had provided the latest signal for fund managers to move into bonds or equities, he said. German government bonds remained subdued after Friday's rally, with the yield on 10-year bonds remaining at around 6.5 per cent. UK government bonds rose across the yield curve again yesterday as sterling remained firm. The best gains were seen at longer maturities, leading to a further flat-tening of the UK yield curve. The recent bounce in sterling was reported to have encouraged greater buying by foreign investors. In the first 10 months of this financial year, foreigners had bought only a net Pounds 500m of gilts, according to UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. The continuing rally prompted the Bank of England to issue a further three tranches of gilts totalling Pounds 700m, after last week's Pounds 1bn. The bonds issued are: Pounds 100m 6 3/4 per cent gilts due 1995/98, Pounds 300 of 9 per cent gilts due 2000 and Pounds 300m of 9 1/2 per cent gilts due 2004.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today sees the celebration in Paris of the 50th  anniversary of the appeal made in Brazzaville by General De  Gaulle in 1944. This appeal signaled the beginning of the  process of French decolonization in Africa. The ceremonies were  to have been held in Brazzaville, but in the light of the  current tension in the Congolese capital, they are being held in  Avenue Kleber in Paris. Congo is represented on this occasion  by its prime minister, Joachim Yhombi-Opango. Earlier today, he  spoke to Assane Diop, who began by asking him what the  Brazzaville appeal meant to him.    [Begin recording] [Yhombi-Opango] There is indeed a  situation  of insecurity in Brazzaville, or rather in one part of  Brazzaville. Three areas out of seven are living in a climate of  insecurity due to the fact that, at one point, some of our  political colleagues decided to look for a political solution by  arming their militia's. Congo, however, is not made up of 80,000  inhabitants, but of 2 million. The rest of the country goes on  living and working as normal. Having said this, we are  concerned by the situation in Brazzaville. We have done  everything for dialogue to prevail. The point about dialogue is  that it does not bring immediate solutions: one has to be  patient; one has to enter into constructive dialogue, and wait  for the results.    [Diop] Prime Minister, there have been several attempts at  dialogue: Gabon has offered its mediation, which led to the  Libreville accords in August. And yet every time, the violence  has flared up again. Estimates give more than 200 killed since  November in Brazzaville alone. For a population of 80,000, that  is a lot.    [Yhombi-Opango] Let us examine the problem rationally. The  mediation, even that offered by Gabon, was essentially a  mediation on problems arising from the elections. In other  words, ensuring that a second round of voting could go ahead,  which did indeed happen. Today, those people who are holding  weapons consider that the arbitration college--which was set up  by the Libreville accords, should announce the results of the  elections. You have heard some opposition leaders declaring  that, once the results have been announced, the situation will  return to normal in Brazzaville.    The fundamental problem, therefore, is the problem of power.  People are fighting because--as President Pascal Lissouba has  said--their stomachs are speaking.    [Diop] Is this to say that President Lissouba, who was in  power before the elections, has not accepted his defeat?    [Yhombi-Opango] The simple reason I can give you is this: If  he is armed, it is not because his life is in danger. I can  tell you as prime minister that nobody is threatening either  President Sassou-Nguesso or President Bernard Kolelas, who is a  member of the National Assembly.    [Diop] Would you agree to hold talks with President Denis  Sassou-Nguesso. Political conflicts in Africa are often very  personal. People say that there is a grudge between you and  President Sassou and vice-versa. Would you agree to hold open,  rational talks with President Denis Sassou-Nguesso in order to  put an end to the violence?    [Yhombi-Opango] Hold talks yes, but talk about what?    [Diop] About peace.    [Yhombi-Opango] But everyone wants peace. I am prime  minister today, because President Pascal Lissouba thought it  would be useful to appoint me to that position as one of the  leaders of the presidential group who contributed to the victory  of the Presidential group in the elections. I am not prime  minister because I took up arms at some time. What we are  looking for in the search for peace is respect for the  institutions that we have set up freely. Now, if we are to talk  in the context of a normal return to peace, because there are  differences between one or the other, then we can talk, but as  responsible politicians.    [Diop] If problems were to persist, if dialogue did not lead  to anything, don't you fear an Algerian-style situation; in  other words, that there might be a third force, like the  [Algerian] Higher State Council that was put into place after  the cancellation of the 1992 elections? Would you not perhaps  find yourselves back at square one, with the democratic process  interrupted?    [Yhombi-Opango] We have not reached this point. I think that  in our country there is a state and a government that have a  duty to protect the security of the people. I would say that we  are giving dialogue and mediation every possible chance, so that  everyone understands the necessity of taking part. There will  come a time, however, when, as the authorities in charge of the  government, we will have to take every responsibility for  returning peace to the country. This is the price to pay in the  building of our country. It is not a sign of weakness to have  accepted--and the president of the Republic keeps insisting on  this point--it is not a sign of weakness to seek dialogue. On  the contrary. If we see that the efforts that we are making  today do not have the expected results, then the government will  take its responsibilities. [end recording]    That was the Congolese prime minister, Joachim  Yhombi-Opango.  He was interviewed by Assane Diop. The representatives in  France of the Congolese opposition have issued a strong protest  against the presence of Mr. Opango in Paris. In a communique  issued today, the Congolese opposition stresses that the fact  that the commemoration of the Brazzaville Appeal is taking place  in Paris [rather than Brazzaville] should alert international  public opinion to the current situation in Congo.</p>

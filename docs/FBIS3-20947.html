			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Stefan Willeke: "Fractal Research"] </F>   [Text] The Ingenieur Digest (ID) interviews Prof. Dr.  Hans-Juergen Warnecke, the new president of the Fraunhofer  Society, about the future of German research and his  specialty--factory organization.    ID: How do you see the special place of the  Fraunhofer Society within the German research community?    Warnecke: We are actually a service operation for society  and  the economy. The special mission of the Fraunhofer Society is to  bridge the great gap between knowledge-oriented and  result-oriented research. Consequently, our researchers ought  not be viewed simply as scientists but as salesmen and  entrepreneurs as well.    ID: That sounds like an excerpt from your book  The Fractal Factory. What do you intend to change in the  Fraunhofer Society?    Warnecke: A new man at the top always does things  differently  because he brings in a different mentality. But not just for  that reason alone. Conditions have changed for the Fraunhofer  Society. I shall therefore strengthen the promising  decentralized structure and management of the Society. The 50  institutes that we have, including those in the new federal  states, operate as independent profit centers in their own  specialty. They have to market accordingly and constantly  monitor their own efficiency.    ID: The knowledge-oriented and result-oriented  research dichotomy you refer to has been much discussed. How do  you view the relationship between basic and applied research?    Warnecke: Basic research, as always, is very important. We  need basic research knowledge upon which to build, without,  however, being under the constant pressure of seeking  applications and uses. The question really is just how much  basic research and how much applications research we should  undertake. It is my opinion that applications research should,  owing to current innovative weaknesses and the great need for  quick innovations, receive the greater emphasis.    ID: Do you welcome this development.    Warnecke: There is no other choice for me. I don't want to  start an allocations war. That would be ridiculous. We must--in  view of limited resources--set priorities sensibly within a  cooperative dialogue with the political, scientific, and  economic sectors.    ID: In your book, you ridicule the slavish copying  of Japanese production models. What do you propose instead?    Warnecke: We have to develop our own concepts as how to  organize, structure, and manage conpanies in Germany. The  question today is to survive in a climate of increasingly more  intensive global competition and under increasingly turbulent  conditions. We cannot do that if we must first wait for some new  message of salvation from Japan before getting up off our duffs.    ID: Perhaps, the reason for this is that we do not  have a salvation plan of our own. What, then, specifically has  to be changed in the German business world?    Warnecke: It must constantly be in a position to react  swiftly to new surprises emanating from the customer and from  the competition; innovations must become routine. A single  production process is no longer decisive for maintaining  competitiveness in such a changed situation. Rather,  communications and information exchange between the various  specialists must be perfected. In this way the logistics--in the  broadest sense--will be made available for the successfully  breaking bottlenecks. This is why German industry has suddenly  found itself is such difficulties.    ID: You therefore propose "fractals," that is,  relatively independent operational entities, as the solution.  How would that function in practice?    Warnecke: In the following way. I view a particular company  undertaking and proceed to engage a number of subcontracters to  carry it out. I find them in our own business. Each associated  group can be viewed as an independent subcontracter to whom I  assign a specific target goal. In the ideal case, each  individual associate knows his own target goal. Besides the  targeting system, a navigational system is also needed. Each  associate has to know precisely where he stands with respect,  for example, to processing times, defect rate, and costs. These  are the data that determine the difference between the specified  planned state and the actual state of affairs. We hope--and  various projects have given us reason to hope--that a  motivational thrust will ensue from the difference between the  specified and actual states so that the process continually  improves itself.    ID: Isn't there a danger of the subcontractors  becoming too independent?    Warnecke: I don't think so. The overall organization ought  not become chaotic. We shall--as before--have a top management  team, but with the flatest possible hierarchy.    ID: Is management ready for this?    Warnecke: Of course there will be a learning process. It is  simply not going to be the case that the individual fractals,  the business entities, or cells--it doesn't matter what you call  them--will only be established and structured from top  management once, and then left to be. Further improvements will  be made whenever deficiencies or problems are detected. The  system will have its own dynamic. We are bringing the  customer-supplier relationships together in an internal  competition.    ID: Please give an example.    Warnecke: Take, for example, the present maintenance field.  As a supplier to the production field, it had to be understood  as a subcontractor. In future, it will no longer have a fixed  budget with a fixed number of workers. Instead, it might be  decided that you will only be budgeted on the basis of half the  number of your staff workers. The other half you will have to  earn by performing services and jobs for which the production  groups or fractals contract you.    ID: In developing such model factories, do you  have any specific examples in mind?    Warnecke: There have been and continue to be companies that  already practice this. Science is lagging behind. One example  that comes to mind is the Mettler-Toledo Company in Albstadt. It  was brought to my attention by someone who had read my book and  said that he had seen my "fractal factory" in operation there.    ID: Have you found any emulators?    Warnecke: Yes, in the meantime there have been small to  medium-size companies that are attempting to do the same. But  any one who attempts to do this must be fully aware that you  simply cannot buy an organizational structure. You have to find  your own specific solution.    ID: After the collapse of entire industries, the  East German enterprises are in particular need of structural  solutions. Does your concept offer any hope in resolving these  immense difficulties?    Warnecke: It would be presumptuous of me to claim that those  very special problems could be eliminated in this way. But there  is a certain harsh advantage in starting from point zero. In  some ways, it is simpler than attempting to introduce changes in  a matured West German organizational structure. Out of  necessity, that is now being attempted with brute force. There  are some opportunities for it in the eastern states.    ID: Are they being taken advantage of?    Warnecke: Opel has introduced a policy change in its  Eisenach  plant. A manager also wanted to show me a factory in  Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, a branch of the Pfanni Company in  Munich, that was operating on my principles. The manager told me  that he had actually structured his plant contrary to  instructions from Munich, with the strong support of the workers.    Professor Warnecke has headed the Fraunhofer Institute for  Production Technology and Automation; he is a member of the  management boards of various institutes and companies; and he  teaches at Stuttgart University. By virtue of his books and 400  professional publications, he is considered the pope of factory  planners.</p>

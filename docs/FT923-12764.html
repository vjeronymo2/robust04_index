			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Management: Take your partner - Strategic alliances between companies are in vogue but Christopher Lorenz warns they can bring problems Strategic alliances are seen almost universally these days as a 'good thing'  -like motherhood. But they are just as hard work. And they are by no means for everyone. These may seem truisms, but they need saying after this week's declaration by Jack Kuehler, president of IBM, that 'you are going to see more and more alliances. They are the way of the future'. As part of its rejuvenation programme, IBM is signing up a remarkable number of partners. But the computer giant is far from alone in its enthusiasm. Its new Dollars 1bn joint venture with Toshiba of Japan and Siemens of Germany to develop advanced memory chips was unveiled on the same day as a Dollars 700m deal between Japan's Fujitsu and Advanced Micro Devices, a Silicon Valley chip-maker. In a far from unusual week towards the end of June, no less than seven important international alliances were either unveiled for the first time, or strengthened further. They included: Electrolux and AEG (in household appliances); an Italian and a Japanese steel company; Renault and Volvo; IBM and Toshiba (in a different deal); Toshiba and Apple; Olivetti and Digital Equipment; Philips and JVC. Such activity, say business academics from Harvard and elsewhere, is creating a 'borderless world' in which companies change shape constantly in response to shifting circumstances. Rather than trying to do everything themselves, or just subcontracting selected work to each year's lowest bidder, they strip themselves back to the core - and sometimes beyond it - putting even prized activities into partnership with other companies which are often their rivals. Some of these partnerships endure, but most change with the wind - or, as in chips, with the shifting pace of technology and competitive actions. In an era of fast-moving global competition, the apparent attractions of this strategy are obvious. High development and production costs (and risks) can be shared, as in this week's IBM deal. Critical 'time to market' can be saved. Scarce human skills can be pooled. Access can be gained to difficult markets and distribution channels. Individual product gaps can be filled, and the scope of product lines broadened immensely. On top of these advantages, alliances can be used as a politically acceptable precursor either to acquiring a new business, or to exiting from an old one - you merely sell it to your partner. Philips is an arch practitioner of this tactic. So why the doubts? Part of the answer is provided by Helmut Maucher, chairman of Nestle. 'I don't share the euphoria for alliances and joint ventures', he said last month. 'First, very often they're an excuse, and an easy way out when people should do their own homework. Secondly, all joint ventures create additional difficulties - you share power and cultures, and decisions take longer.' Hence Nestle's very sparing use of alliances: its two main ones are with Coca-Cola in canned coffee and tea, and with General Mills in the breakfast cereals market. In both cases, Nestle is gaining valuable learning - a key to any alliance - as well as saving time and getting access to new markets. It is acting from positive motives, like most Japanese companies. By contrast, the motivation of many western companies which enter alliances  -especially with Far Eastern partners - tends to be negative, or at least defensive. They seem to believe that strength can be created out of weakness. It seldom can, unless the weaker company uses the relationship not just to fill an immediate product gap, but also to revitalise its technology or other skills. Such learning is hard to accomplish. So is the necessary building of walls around the know-how that one wants to protect from one's partner. With its recent sub-contracting of small engine design to Yamaha, Ford could lose as much as it gains. A more blatant case of co-operation out of weakness has been McDonnell Douglas' desperate bid to stay in the commercial aircraft business by giving Taiwan technology in return for massive subsidy. The many pitfalls which confront international alliance partners, both weak and strong, have been the subject of several studies by consultants at McKinsey &amp; Company. One of them, by two Germans, warns that co-operation may be part of a strategy, but that it is not a strategy in itself. 'If managers focus on it to the exclusion of all stand-alone possibilities, they become vulnerable,' say the authors. Other McKinsey studies ram home the counter-intuitive point that it is a mistake for a strong company to ally with a weaker one. The latter often becomes a drag on the venture's competitiveness. The latest research, to be published in the next issue of the McKinsey Quarterly, is even tougher. Focusing especially on alliance strategies for companies that are European 'national champions', it concludes that: For weak companies, alliances are not a way to avoid sale. Defensive alliances complicate or even prevent an eventual sale. 'Trojan horse' worries are justified, since most alliances are temporary, and end with acquisition by the stronger (or strongest) partner. Pursuing multiple alliances is a dangerous approach for European national champions which are simultaneously taking steps to improve their core businesses or which have little past experience with alliances. Succeeding at even one takes a lot of time and effort. There is a further problem with the attitude of most western companies to alliances. Most see each deal individually, rather than as part of a network. Thus AMD, in its trumpeting of this week's agreement with Fujitsu, seemed to take little account of the Japanese company's extensive network of relationships with western companies, including ICL, Siemens and Amdahl. Does it understand how it features, and could be manipulated, in Fujitsu's global battle plan against IBM? Equally, does IBM really understand where it figures in Toshiba's strategy of partnerships with all and sundry? The same applies within the US itself, to IBM's place in Apple's growing spider's web of relationships - and vice versa. Alliances may give companies unprecedented flexibility. But, by the same token, they render them unstable. To revert to analogies from personal life, it is far easier to control one's destiny if one has just a couple of mutually compliant lovers than if one tries to run a series of ever-changing, one-night stands. For most companies, Nestle's conservatism is a better model than IBM's promiscuity.</p>

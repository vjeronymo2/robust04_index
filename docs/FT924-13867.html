			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Tay dips 26% but lifts payment TAY HOMES, the Leeds-based housebuilder, saw year-end pre-tax profits dip 26 per cent in depressed conditions. But turnover increased as it sold more than 1,000 houses for the first time and it cut gearing. An increased final dividend of 4.65p was declared, making 5.85p (5.3p) for the year. Taxable profits in the year to June 30 1992 declined to Pounds 6.14m (Pounds 8.26m) on sales of Pounds 76.22m (Pounds 70.58m). Operating profits were down to Pounds 9.25m (Pounds 11.63m). Reduced gearing of 47 per cent (66 per cent) on borrowings of Pounds 14.2m was partly due to a shift of costs on a show house joint venture being shifted off the balance sheet. Interest charges fell to Pounds 3.11m (Pounds 3.37m). Mr Trevor Spencer, chairman, said the year-end figures were an excellent achievement in uniquely difficult conditions. He said that while a forecast was difficult, the group's ability to generate profit reflected its capacity to weather the recession and recover strongly when conditions improved. Sales of houses, mainly in Yorkshire, rose to 1,094 from 849. The Midlands was also strong but trading in Scotland declined. Average prices dipped to Pounds 64,900 (Pounds 74,300), reflecting a focus on cheaper housing. Sales of mainly Scottish plots from the group's land bank, which stood at 4,800 units at year-end, totalled Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 2.3m). Funds tied up in part-exchange homes totalled Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 5.2m) at year-end. Shareholders funds rose to Pounds 30.31m (Pounds 28.05m) representing assets per share of 138.2p (127.9p). Earnings declined to 18.1p (25.1p).</p>

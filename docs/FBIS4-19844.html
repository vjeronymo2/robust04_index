			<p>BFN     [Text] FRG Foreign Minister Kinkel has invited released  Chinese dissident Wang and his wife to visit Bonn. As the  Foreign Ministry reported this morning, the wife of the regime  critic confirmed that her husband had been released from prison  on bail to receive medical treatment in the United States.    Wang, one of the leaders of the 1989 democracy movement,  which was bloodily crushed, had been sentenced to 13 years'  imprisonment. Kinkel had repeatedly advocated Wang's release.</p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Scottish reform costings disputed GOVERNMENT claims that its proposed reform of local government in Scotland would lead to large cost savings have been challenged by Strathclyde regional council, Scotland's largest local authority and the one most likely to disappear if the reform goes ahead. A council working party says savings would be much less - and transitional costs far higher - than consultants Touche Ross calculated in a study for the Scottish Office, A Scottish Office green paper published in October proposes replacing the nine regional councils, 53 district councils and three unitary island councils with a single-tier structure. It made calculations on options involving 15, 24, 35 and 51 unitary authorities. Touche Ross said a 15-council structure would save Pounds 192m a year, 24 would save Pounds 120m, and 35 would save Pounds 55m. A 51-council arrangement would cost Pounds 58m more. Strathclyde says that reform would not lead to the big reduction in planning and economic development costs envisaged by Touche Ross, and that savings in central support services are overestimated. It says annual savings would occur only if the government chose the 15-council model and would then only amount to Pounds 71m. The other three models would produce higher annual costs, with the 51-council structure costing Pounds 175m more. The council says the consultants underestimated transitional costs, including redundancy and residuary bodies' costs, and overestimated revenue from property disposals. Strathclyde says the transitional costs for 15 councils would be Pounds 333m against the government estimate of Pounds 215m; for 24 councils it would be Pounds 439m against Pounds 195m; for 35 councils it would be Pounds 476m against Pounds 175m; and for 51 councils it would be Pounds 484m against Pounds 159m.</p>

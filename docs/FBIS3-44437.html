Having closed the book, I could not help pondering  deeply: Although I have read or heard about some of the  articles in it before, yet the publication of this epoch-making  works as decided by the party's Central Committee with Comrade  Jiang Zemin at the core according to its extremely farsighted  strategy is just like a magnificent theoretical building  distinctly and completely towering aloft before me with the  dazzling splendor of the age. This is the scientific system of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, which has been unfolded to us in this  book.    This foundation works of contemporary China's Marxism has  profoundly revealed the historical tendency and inherent law  that governs Chinese socialist development; has charted the only  correct course toward the prosperity of the country, the  rejuvenation of our nation, and the happiness of the people; and  has pointed out the only correct direction for the energetic  advance of China's socialist cultural undertaking under the new  historical conditions.    At present, we are concentrating our efforts on intensifying  the building of the cultural market, which is a burgeoning  domain that has been developing rapidly over the past 10 years  or so. As an indispensable component part of China's socialist  material and spiritual civilizations, the building of cultural  market must be persistently guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.  <H6>  I. </H6>   Over the past 10 years or so, the vigorous rise and rapid  growth of China's socialist cultural markets, and the impact and  role brought about by these markets, which serve as links and  intermediaries for promoting socialist cultural prosperity and  the two civilizations, have almost become the most spectacular  cultural and economic phenomenon in China since the early  1980's. With varying views, people are either pleased, worried,  or half-pleased, half-worried at this phenomenon. However, the  impact of economic restructuring on the cultural structure is a  reality independent of man's subjective will. That is why we  should give a Marxist answer to it in conformity with China's  national conditions.    The establishment of a socialist market economic structure  is  a major content of the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. With extraordinary theoretical courage and  realistic spirit, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "There is  no contradiction between socialism and the market economy, so  the question is--what methods we should apply to develop the  productive forces of society more energetically." Aiming at the  shackles in people's minds that have been formed under the  planned economic structure for a long time, he repeatedly  stressed: "We must make it clear in theory that the difference  between capitalism and socialism does not lie in such an issue  as planning or market. There is market economy in socialism,  and planned control in capitalism." Over the past dozen years,  the growth of China's commodity economy and reform of the  economic structure have brought changes to various areas of  China's social life in varying degrees, including the  development of the socialist cultural markets. As the welfare  pattern of "mass entertainment at the expense of the state"  under the previous planned economic structure has been broken,  and cultural markets have been the principal places of the  people's consumption of culture, the sluggish cultural markets  for several decades have been vigorously activated.  Particularly after the objective of establishing a socialist  market economic structure was defined at the 14th National Party  Congress, cultural markets have encountered new development  opportunities and motive forces again and advanced by leaps and  bounds. Just take the entertainment markets as an example.  Various kinds of cultural and recreational places across the  country have grown from 80,000 in 1990 to 200,000. Today,  cultural markets have become important sites for people to  engage in cultural activities.    After we have read through the Selected Works, it  is not difficult for us to understand that the fundamental  objective of establishing a socialist market economic structure  is to accelerate the development of productive forces. Comrade  Deng Xiaoping repeatedly pointed out: "The basic tenet of  Marxism is to develop productive forces," and the "most  fundamental task at the socialist stage is the development of  productive forces." Just as the development of socialist market  economy will certainly bring about comprehensive changes in  China's economic structure because of the necessity to develop  productive forces, the prosperity of socialist cultural markets  will certainly bring about opportunities and challenges for  change in China's cultural structure because of the necessity to  develop culture and art. The report of the 14th national party  congress pointed out: "The establishment of a socialist market  economic structure involves a number of areas in China's  economic base and superstructure and calls for a series of  appropriate structural reforms and policy readjustments." This  has clearly told us that the changes will not only vigorously  shake China's economic field and reform China's basic mode of  economic operation, but also vigorously shake China's cultural  field and launch a powerful onslaught upon the primary creation,  the organizational modes, and the pattern of supply and demand  of culture and art. Therefore, we should note that reform to  abolish the old cultural structure and establish a new one so  that it is suited to the socialist market economic structure has  undoubtedly become a historical necessity.    Although changes will get things straightened out, yet if  the  cultural structural reform is to push literature and art as well  as cultural workers into the markets, or to be carried out at  the costs of losing the spirit of cultural workers and lowering  the quality of literature and art, as some people think, then,  the cultural structural reform will deviate from the correct  path. The cultural structural reform must be suited to the  socialist market economic structure and at the same time conform  with the requirements of socialist spiritual civilization and  the laws governing the self- development of culture and art. We  should both note the internal relations between cultural and  economic structural reforms and their generality in some  aspects, and at the same time fully understand their own laws  and specific properties. Only by accurately grasping this point  can we attain healthy and smooth development in the cultural  structural reform. As an important part and parcel of the  socialist market economy, China's cultural markets will  certainly abide by the rules and general laws governing markets  in development. However, as the creation of cultural products  is complicated mental labor, its rise and fall as well as  success and failure cannot be totally decided by market rules.  Besides, as relations between long-term development and  short-term consumption of the cultural undertaking must be  correctly handled, the regulation of their proportions cannot be  totally decided by material gain and conduct of markets. What  is more, as products that are put into the cultural markets have  both the properties of commodity and ideology, selection of them  cannot be totally decided by the commercial gains and losses of  the markets. These characteristics of our socialist cultural  market calls for us to exercise even more direct and powerful  regulation and control of these markets through policy, legal,  economic, and administrative means. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has  put forth the scientific criteria for judging the nature, gain,  loss, success, and failure of reform, which have provided us  with theoretical bases for judging the gain, loss, success, and  failure of cultural structural reform. Specifically speaking,  there are three criteria for judgment-- whether or not reform is  beneficial to fully mobilizing and displaying the initiative and  creativity of the vast number of literary and artistic workers,  to turning out literary and artistic works and qualified  personnel for the prosperity of the socialist cultural  undertaking to satisfy the increasing demands of the people's  cultural life, and to promoting economic development and  comprehensive social progress.  <H6>  II. </H6>   In 1985, in light of the tendency of bourgeois  liberalization  and money worship which emerged on the ideological and cultural  fronts at that time, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out:  "Ideological, cultural, educational, and public health  departments should take social effectiveness as the only  criterion for all activities, and enterprises which they belong  to should also take social effectiveness as their highest  criterion." As these expositions have made unequivocal judgment  on specific characteristics, they not only seized hold of the  primary issue of ideological and cultural work, but are of  tremendous guiding significance to the building of China's  socialist cultural markets. Just as Marx said: "The difficulty  lies just in the general expression of these contradictions.  Once their specific characteristics are defined, they are  clearly explained."    Following Comrade Deng Xiaoping's Marxist mode of judgment,  we might well see how practice has revealed the specific  characteristics of China's socialist cultural markets.    First, contemporary China's cultural markets are part and  parcel of the socialist market economic system on one hand, and  a major area of the socialist spiritual civilization on the  other. Their healthy development can only be achieved by  serving the socialist material and spiritual civilizations.  Such dual properties of China's socialist cultural markets have  determined that they cannot under any circumstances simply and  passively adapt themselves to the general rules and modes of  market operations, but that, while correctly reflecting  circulating and regulating functions, they should fully display  functions in various aspects including recreational  appreciation, exchange of information, education through  propaganda, cultural accumulation, and so on, with a view to  satisfying people's demands at different levels in their  cultural life; promoting socialist spiritual civilization;  pushing forward cultural structural reform; augmenting the  self-developing vitality of cultural units; giving impetus to  the development of community- run cultural industries; improving  investment environment and tapping tax sources to bring about  economic prosperity; enhancing the competitiveness of national  culture in the international cultural markets; facilitating the  cultural exchange with foreign countries, and so on.    Second, as major objects of circulation in cultural markets,  intellectual products have their specific patterns which are  different from ordinary material products. This has likewise  conditioned the specific characteristics of China's socialist  cultural markets as follows: 1) The creation of cultural  products is different from that of material products. In a  strict sense, the production of commodities is solely for the  purpose of exchange. Objectively, all cultural products in the  true sense are also for the purpose of exchange but,  fundamentally speaking, they are personal creations of literary  and artistic workers, and vivid reflection of their great  enthusiasm and true strength. 2) Compared with material  products, it is more difficult to accurately calculate the time  of labor necessary for cultural products. It is also very  difficult to compare the time taken to create literary and  artistic works by different persons even in the same category of  cultural work. 3) In the economic area, the more developed the  commodity economy is, the more necessary it is to abide by the  principle of exchange at equal value. Now, as in the past, it  is difficult for cultural products to realize universal and real  exchange at equal value even in the most developed country in  the world which practices commodity economy. 4) The difference  in the value of utility. The value of utility for ordinary  commodities should play a similar part in satisfying the demands  of different customers. As consumers have an identical  yardstick for commodities, it is possible to compete on an  entirely equal footing. But the value of utility in cultural  products is closely related to subjective elements of consumers,  that is, people have very different measurements and attitudes  toward the value of the utility of cultural products with  ideological tints owing to consumers' varying stands, views, and  cultural standards. In face of the social and economic  effectiveness naturally brought forth by commodity properties  and specific characteristics pertinent to intellectual products,  we must work hard to achieve the dialectical unity of social and  economic effectiveness in our socialist cultural markets, while  persistently placing social effectiveness in a primary position.    Since reform and opening up, trials and hardships in China's  construction of socialist cultural markets have undoubtedly  shown that the crucial link of fundamentally placing social  effectiveness in a primary position and really achieving the  dialectical unity of effectiveness in the two aspects is what  kind of intellectual products we should use to occupy the  socialist cultural markets and give positive and healthy  guidance to the masses in their cultural market consumption.  Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "With regard to our  literature and art, greater efforts should be made to depict and  foster new socialist individuals to yield fruitful results. We  should portray the pioneers of the four modernizations, reflect  their brand new appearance with revolutionary idealism and a  scientific approach, lofty sentiments and creativeness, and a  broad vision and realistic spirit. Through the images of these  new individuals, we should inspire the socialist enthusiasm of  the broad masses and promote their activities of historic  creation for the four modernizations." Here, proceeding from  the overall situation of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, Comrade Deng Xiaoping advanced the issue of how  we should loudly raise the main melody of the spirit of the age  in contemporary China's socialist spiritual civilization, which  actually exists. As far as literary and artistic creation is  concerned, it is the issue of how we should loudly raise the  main melody of the creation of literary and artistic works.  Comrade Jiang Zemin said that reflection of the spirit of the  age should be the main melody of our literature and art. He  pointed out: "Patriotism, socialism, and collectivism should  become the main melody of our society."    There is always the spirit of the age which holds a leading  position in the comprehensive ideological and cultural  development in any society at all times. As a reflection of  aesthetic views in social life, literary and artistic creation  must also have its own main melody. In contemporary China, this  melody is identical with that in actual life. Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, the party's basic line, principles, and  policies, patriotism, collectivism, and socialism are the main  melody of the actual life in contemporary China. Therefore, in  literary and artistic creation, the main melody we refer to  should be the mainstream of creation formed by art and  literature with artistic charm and healthy content, which take  great pains to reflect the spirit of the age and encourage  people to positively dedicate themselves to the great practice  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The more  resonant this main melody of art and literature is, the more  powerful it will be at serving the people and socialism and the  principle of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred  schools of thought contend.    The actual social life and the people's demands for culture  are rich, colorful, and diversified. Our literary and artistic  creations, including the works of main melody, should also be  rich, colorful, and diversified in theme, form, style, and  method of expression. In other words, while stressing to loudly  raise the main melody, we must encourage this diversity. This  is the practical and dialectical view of correctly handling  relations between the two aspects. Only by achieving this  dialectical unity of integrating theory with practice can we  create fine literary and artistic works which are suited to both  refined and popular tastes, and which are worthy of the great  age without precedent; fill the socialist cultural markets with  intellectual products having artistic charm and healthy content,  which particularly sing the praises of reform, opening up, and  modernization; guide the people in their consumption of culture;  and push forward the healthy advance of cultural markets.  <H6>  III. </H6>   The idea of "doing two types of work simultaneously" is a  major component part of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as the  concrete application of dialectical materialism in the process  of our socialist modernization with great creative spirit. With  regard to the overall building of the country, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping pointed out: "We must pay special attention to the  building of material civilization. Meanwhile, we must build  socialist spiritual civilization as well." On the issue of  handling the relation between reform and stability, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping pointed out: "We must grasp reform and opening up with  one hand, and the crackdown on various kinds of criminal  activities with the other." On the issue of the production of  art and literature, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out:  "Cultural circles should create more quality intellectual  products, and resolutely check the production, importation, and  circulation of harmful products." There is another prominent  point in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's idea of "doing two types of  work simultaneously"--we must not stress material progress at  the expense of cultural and ideological progress, but attach  equal importance to both. The stand, view, and method of "doing  two types of work simultaneously" not only play an important  guiding role in controlling at macro level the overall situation  of China's socialist modernizations, but also serve as powerful  weapons in building socialist cultural markets with Chinese  characteristics.    Since reform and opening up, China's cultural markets have  developed very rapidly to include markets of entertainment,  audio- visual equipment, press and publication, fine arts,  performances, films, historical relics, cultural exchanges with  foreign countries, training in art and culture, and others, in a  comprehensive way, from the previous simple markets of cinemas,  television shows, theaters, book stalls, newsstands, and booths  for folk performances. The present markets have played an  irreplaceable role in promoting the economy, satisfying and  enriching the people's life, and developing socialist cultural  undertakings. At present, however, China is in the  developmental period, the growth of cultural markets has not yet  matured, and there are very chaotic phenomena in the course of  rapid development. In this regard, we must acquire a sober  understanding and adopt resolute and powerful measures to  resolve them.    To sum up, there are six major serious problems in cultural  markets: First, in the press, publication, and audio-visual  markets, illegal business activities such as smuggling,  trafficking, stealing of copyrights, reselling of publication  numbers at a profit, and others, are increasingly rampant.  Illegal publications of inferior quality and low prices are  flooding in, disrupting markets and throwing state-owned  publishers into an extremely dire predicament. In the meantime,  some state publishing units also engaged in very serious  activities such as reselling publication numbers at a profit,  and so on, thus providing chances to illegal elements for their  wrongdoings. Recently, concentrated efforts have been made to  crack down on them and, although they have pulled in their horns  for the moment, yet the matter is far from being solved. Second,  markets are flooded with pornographic books, periodicals, and  audio and video tapes in increasingly large volume, extensive  circulation, and open forms. Owing to the repeated failure of  banning them, they have seriously polluted the social  environment and impaired the physical and mental health of the  broad masses, young people in particular. Third, pornographic  activities in some entertainment sites have gained ground to a  certain extent, and some of them even solicit customers with sex  services to reap exorbitant profits in an imposing manner. In  this way, they have poisoned the social atmosphere and damaged  the image of the party and country. Fourth, some operators of  video game centers are engaged in gambling under cover of lucky  draws, complying with relevant state regulations overtly but  opposing them covertly, and turning entertainment sites into  gambling houses, which is absolutely incompatible with our  socialist system. Fifth, in the performances of overseas film  and television stars and singers, the abnormal tendencies  including enterprise sponsorship with public funds, high ticket  prices, expensive admission fees, andf tax evasion, among other  things, are very serious. Sixth, the film market has shrunk,  and the targets for shows, audience, issues, and income continue  to decline. In order to contend for audience with the centers  of video shows projected by laser compact discs, some individual  localities even disregard relevant regulations and vie with each  other to show "documentary films" and "category III films,"  which has produced an adverse effect in society.    There are complicated reasons for the emergence and spread  of  the above problems. They are problems of ideological  understanding, operating direction, improper management  structure, ineffective macroscopic regulation and control,  unsound policies and statutes, relaxed law enforcement, and  defiance of law. The basic idea of resolving these problems is  to adhere to the principle of "doing two types of work  simultaneously" proposed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping in building  socialist material and spiritual civilizations. To implement  concretely the principle in the cultural markets, we should  persistently intensify management to eliminate cultural garbage  on the one hand, and occupy and enrich cultural markets with  flourishing, healthy, and useful cultural products on the other.  Moreover, we should adopt powerful measures to guide and rectify  cultural markets to exercise the positive role of cultural  markets and check their negative role to the maximum. To be  specific, the following tasks are extremely necessary:    First, laying equal stress on purification and prosperity.  At present, there are a number of problems in cultural markets  where the good is mingled with the bad and the sham with the  genuine. We make great efforts to rectify and purify the  markets. Certainly, this is a long-term and arduous mission.  We must take control of it constantly and unflinchingly. Our  attitude is very definite: Never allow phenomena of sexuality,  pornography, murder, violence, feudal superstition, and gambling  to exist in our cultural markets. With regard to spiritual  civilization, stress should be laid on the building of it.  Apart from intensifying management and rectification, it is all  the more important to concentrate our efforts on prosperity, let  more healthy, useful, rich, and colorful cultural products which  reflect the main melody of the age and appeal to both the more  and the less cultured occupy cultural markets and satisfy the  masses' increasing demands for diversified culture, so that the  pernicious cultural rubbish will not gain a foothold. In this  sense, prosperity is a matter of vital importance in changing  the current condition of the cultural markets.    Second, laying equal stress on bringing about a temporary  and a permanent solution. In recent years, the party Central  Committee and the State Council seriously heeded the struggle of  eliminating pornography and cracking down on criminal activities  in the area of illegal publications. Through several  concentrated actions and comprehensive management, problems in  the cultural markets have been resolved to some extent. This is  absolutely necessary. However, after the concentrated  crackdown, we must adopt effective measures to put an end once  and for all to deep-rooted problems of the cultural markets.  The national cultural market work meeting, which has just  ended, put forththe following: While carrying out their annual  examination, cultural and administrative departments in all  localities must check all dancing halls and karaoke saloons  again, and issue licenses for carrying on cultural business  printed by the Ministry of Culture to those that meet with  approval. As for those that do not come up to requirements,  their business permits will be withdrawn. During this winter  and the coming spring, video show centers (including those using  laser discs) must be reexamined once, and priority should be  given to banning the video show business which is privately  operated or which is in a disguised form of private operation.  Besides, conditions should be created to practice a system,  under which video show centers must submit a monthly show  schedule to the local competent departments. As regards the  press and publication market, it is necessary to continue taking  firm control of "eliminating pornography" and dealing blows to  illegal publications. Apart from the aforementioned measures,  we must accelerate the process of legislation, and perfect laws  and regulations on the management of cultural markets, which are  the fundamental guarantee for promoting the healthy growth of  these markets.    Third, laying equal stress on adopting protective  preferential measures and exercising restrictive tax control.  China's cultural markets are both an important part of the  socialist economic system and a major area of the building of  socialist spiritual civilization. Their socialist nature has  conditioned that it is impossible for them to emerge and perish  of themselves or to rise and ebb of themselves as in some  capitalist countries. Government departments must adopt  protective and restrictive means to exercise macroeconomic  regulation and control to indicate the state's intention of  guiding cultural markets. At present, the decline of elegant  artistic performances has formed a sharp contrast to the  overheated performances of singers and "stars" in the markets.  In view of the above facts, we should adopt a fostering  attitude toward the former, and pertinent departments nationwide  should formulate policies as quickly as possible and provide  preferential policies to them in terms of performance tax,  management fees, transportation charges, and site charges. On  the other hand, they should employ economic and administrative  means to guide social sponsorship to prevent loss of public  funds and to limit performance fees and ticket prices of the  performances put on by singers or "stars" to prevent the  phenomenon of the inferior winning and the superior being  eliminated in cultural markets. In addition, it is necessary to  use economic policies, tax policies in particular, to curb the  blind pursuit of high-grade entertainment sites calling for high  consumption and to concentrate efforts on developing some  medium- and low-grade entertainment sites to meet the demands of  the broad masses. What needs to be pointed out is that to  regulate the markets we cannot help but adopt protective and  restrictive means aimed at checking in good time some major  deviations that have arisen in cultural markets because of their  inability to regulate themselves, so that cultural markets as a  whole will be able to operate in an orderly and healthy way and  will incrementally advance toward higher levels.    Fourth, laying equal stress on government conduct and social  supervision. Along with the rise and growth of cultural  markets, appropriate management organs have been set up, a  contingent of law enforcement personnel have been formed, and a  national management network at central, provincial, prefectural,  county, and township and town levels has basically taken shape  boasting ranks of 150,000 full- and part-time personnel. This  is the precondition as well as guarantee for managing cultural  markets by government departments. Alongside the development of  cultural markets, management tasks are more and more heavy and  difficult. Hence, it is imperative to mobilize social forces to  supervise markets. Very useful experience has been gained by  Shenzhen in this respect. The method of "management by three  parties" has been adopted by this city, that is, 1) management  by the state--exercising regulation and control, giving  guidance, conducting examination, and meting out punishment  according to relevant administrative rules and regulations; 2)  management by the trade--assisting government functional  departments to exercise self-management by the trade association  according to relevant laws, rules, and regulations; and 3)  management by society--mobilizing people in society to exercise  supervision and management, and through the information provided  by part-time checking personnel to promptly report the  lawbreaking and discipline-violating acts of operators. In this  way, management channels for cultural markets have been  broadened so that government departments have had management  "assistants," thus forming a management pattern of "small  government, large society." Moreover, we must also use social  and mass supervisory instruments such as public opinion,  morality, and so on, to promote the healthy growth of China's  socialist cultural markets.    Lenin said: "Without revolutionary theory, there would not  be revolutionary movements." Judging from the course of reform  and opening up over the past dozen years, the process of China's  socialist modernization, as a changing movement in the  development of things, has never for a moment deviated from the  guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics. Therefore, both the building of  material or spiritual civilization, and both the prosperity of  the socialist literary and artistic undertaking or the  development of the socialist cultural markets, have called for  the entire literary and artistic workers, leading cadres at all  levels on the literary and artistic front in particular, to  master comprehensively, accurately, systematically, and  scientifically Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics through in-depth study of  the Selected Works. Only by so doing can we have the  reliable guarantee for fulfilling the heavy responsibilities we  are shouldering. Just as Comrade Jiang Zemin stressed: "If our  party has a large number of comrades who systematically, rather  than fragmentarily, and practically, rather than superficially,  master the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, and who are able to apply this theory to the  study and solution of major problems, then our party's ability  to lead reform, opening up, and socialist modernization will be  substantially enhanced."</p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Pyramids with giddy heights LURED by the promise of multiplying their money eight-fold every three months, Romanians have flocked to the Transylvanian town of Cluj to invest their meagre savings in a scheme known as Caritas - a money-making 'pyramid' scheme. For 18 months, Caritas - run by Mr Ioan Stoica, economics graduate and former bookkeeper - kept its promises, turning investors into lei millionaires and drawing more people into its net. But in the last few weeks Caritas has several times failed to pay out, hitting investor confidence. Caritas appears to be a classic Ponzi scam, named after Mr Charles Ponzi, an Italian immigrant operating in Boston just after the first world war. He persuaded 40,000 investors to part with Dollars 15m by promising to double their money every three months. In theory, he was using their savings to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities in international postal coupons. In practice, he was recycling the savings of new investors to pay back the earlier investors. When the scheme collapsed, Ponzi was sent to prison. He ended his days as a pauper in Rio de Janeiro. Such financial chain letters survive only as long as investment is attracted at ever-increasing rates. In Ponzi's scheme, he had to double inflow of cash every three months. With Caritas, the promise of an even more extravagant eight-fold increase in three months implies a need to double inflow every month. Well-run Ponzi schemes can be kept going for months or even years. But all are eventually doomed. The supply of funds cannot rise exponentially in perpetuity. It is only a matter of time before funds dry up, investors panic or authorities step in. The early investors, of course, get rich. The laggards lose their savings. Ponzi schemes have cropped up in many parts of the world. The UK's Barlow Clowes scandal was effectively a Ponzi scam: the high dividends initial investors received were paid not by shrewd investment but by later investors' cash. Many people in the industrialised world have the experience of being recruited to join pyramid clubs, where they stand to receive large sums of money if they can recruit yet more people to the club. But recently there seems to have been a particularly strong appetite for 'double your money' schemes in some former east bloc countries. Caritas is just the largest of a series in Romania. Serbia also appears to have spawned several. There are various theories why such countries might be vulnerable to such schemes. One is economic deprivation, which has made people desperate to try anything to enrich themselves or merely maintain living standards. In Romania, where earnings have fallen by a third in the past three years, there are tales of pensioners sinking cash into Caritas because they saw that as the only way to meet heating and food bills. Another theory is that societies in transition from communism to capitalism may be susceptible because they have no tradition of discriminating between sound investments and scams. Given the size of the scheme in Romania in relation to its economy, there are dangers that its collapse could have lasting damage. Investors could be so badly burnt they lose faith in financial markets and go back to stuffing cash under mattresses, so stifling the flows of investment necessary if the economy is to grow.</p>

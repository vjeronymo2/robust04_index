			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Stoddard Sekers advances to Pounds 2.1m Despite a dull trading environment, Stoddard Sekers International, the carpets and furnishing fabrics maker, lifted pre-tax profits by 42 per cent from Pounds 1.51m to Pounds 2.14m in the year ended March 31. Turnover rose 8 per cent to Pounds 59.7m (Pounds 55.4m) as a result of a full contribution from BMK (10 months in 1992-93) and the introduction of fabric supply to the automotive industry. Interest charges fell to Pounds 820,000 (Pounds 920,000) and net earnings per share were 1p higher at 2.6p. The recommended final dividend of 0.85p makes a total of 1.6p (1.5p). Mr Ralph Ellis, chief executive, said the group was well structured to achieve acceptable performance at the current level of activity and 'we remain confident that we will be able to sustain steady positive growth'.</p>

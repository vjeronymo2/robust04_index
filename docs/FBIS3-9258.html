			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Mar 22 (TANJUG) -- According to data of  the U.N. War Crimes Commission, at least 55,000 war crimes have  been committed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, TANJUG  has learnt at the Information Center of the Serbian Council  (ICSC) on Tuesday. Most of these crimes were committed against  Serb civilians in Croatia, the ICSC said.    It is estimated that a lot more crimes have in fact been  committed because, according to a statement of Chairman of the  U.N. War Crimes Commission Cherif Bassiouni, not all rapes have  been reported nor have all mass graves been investigated.    Many crimes are still undiscovered, especially in the former  Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, where fierce  Moslem-Croat clashes have been underway for already a year and  the conflicting sides have been accussing each other of  intentional destruction of settlements, massacres of civilians  and torture of prisoners.    The commission of U.N. experts for war crimes on the  territory of the former Yugoslavia, set up two years ago on the  basis of U.N. Security Council Resolution 780, has not managed  to carry out the expected investigation but has only managed to  gather documentation.    As the commission's mandate expires on April 30, it will not  [words indistinct] in eastern Slavonia, on the territory of the  Republic of Serb Krajina, which has been planned for April 10.    The RSK was proclaimed in 1991 in Serb ancestral lands in  the  former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia in response to Croatia's  violent secession from the former Yugoslav Federation and its  attempt to downgrade the Serbs to a national minority.    On March 20, Croatia sent a protest letter to U.N.  Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali claiming that the  commission was "discontinuing work" and that this was "sabotage  against the investigation on the principal war criminals," a  description reserved by the Croatian propaganda for Serbs.    Zagreb had intentionally falsified facts because, above all,  the commision was not discontinuing work but its mandate was  expiring and thus the task it was entrusted to do was being  wrapped up regardless of the fact commission had carried it out.    Besides, due to financial and technical reasons the  commission postponed the beginning of the investigation.  Croatia thus gained time and with the expiration of the  commission's mandate, managed to avoid an international inquiry  into the deaths of the victims buried on its territory.    "We have reliably established that there are 87 graves where  murdered Serbs have been buried in Croatia," an ICSC official  Vojin Dabic told TANJUG and added that the Serb side had  undisputable evidence for this. This evidence was recognized zy  the commission's secretary Julio Baez, during his visit on March  10, he said.    Dabic added that the ICSC has reliable information that  Croats have ploughed over some graves on their territory, such  as the one in Pakracka Poljana in western Slavonia, ahead of the  arrival of U.N. commission experts, in order to hide traces of  the crime. That is precisely why we have to find out where the  remains of the Serb victims have been moved, he said.</p>

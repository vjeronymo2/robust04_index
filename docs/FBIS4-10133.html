			<p>BFN     [Text] We will now read a news agency report that confirms  what this newscast previously reported. It states that Isaac  Oso Chavarria's assistant, Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, has been  clandestinely and illegally removed from the country by DEA  agents. The news agency report states:    The U.S. antinarcotics agency has excused itself before the  Costa Rican Government for not having warned of the transit  through Costa Rica of a Bolivian citizen who testified that  former Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora is linked to a drug  trafficker.    Costa Rican Security Minister Luis Fishman reported that the  DEA cited urgency in its letter as the reason for not having  informed the Costa Rican Government of the arrival of Edgar  Fernandez Lazcano in Costa Rica.    Fernandez Lazcano, who was on his way to Miami on 3 April,  again reported in Costa Rica that last week -- during a long  testimony before Bolivian Prosecutor Leopoldo Ramos Herrada --  he revealed the alleged links between former Bolivian President  Jaime Paz Zamora and drug trafficker Isaac Oso Chavarria.    Fernandez Lazcano, who was clandestinely removed from  Bolivia  by land via Peru, was detained by chance by OIJ [Investigation  Agency] agents in downtown San Jose during a drug enforcement  operation. Following consultations, the Bolivian prosecutor and  Drug Enforcement Officer Ruben Zegada Portugal asked for  permission to question him in conjunction with Costa Rican  officials.</p>

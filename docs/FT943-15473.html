			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Heseltine in row over Archer probe: DTI disclosure meant to avoid allegations of political cover-up Mr Michael Heseltine, Britain's trade and industry secretary, was at the centre of a political controversy yesterday after his department's revelation that Lord Archer, the Tory peer and best-selling novelist, was under investigation for alleged insider dealing. Amid signs that the DTI's unprecedented disclosure had severely damaged Lord Archer's chances of securing a post in Mr John Major's forthcoming ministerial reshuffle, it emerged that Mr Heseltine had acted to avoid charges of a political cover-up. But there were suggestions at Westminster that the DTI statement on its investigation had been a deliberate attempt to undermine Lord Archer's political future. The probe centres on share deals in the run-up to an agreed bid by MAI, the entertainment and financial group, for Anglia Television this year. Lord Archer's wife, Mary, is a non-executive director at Anglia. Senior Tory and Labour figures expressed astonishment that the DTI had broken its long-standing rule of never naming any individual who is under investigation. It is thought that the investigation centres on one large share purchase that resulted in a substantial profit when MAI announced its agreed takeover of Anglia on January 18. Lord Archer has denied buying shares in Anglia ahead of the bid, and yesterday the company confirmed that he had not held shares in his own name or through a nominee account for at least three years. Passing on inside information can be an offence even if the individual concerned does not buy shares or even profit from the trade. For someone knowingly in possession of inside information, it is insider dealing to encourage someone else to trade the shares, having reasonable cause to believe the dealing would take place. Lord Archer has stated that the allegations that have been made are 'completely untrue.' He is going ahead with a planned book signing session at Harrods today. DTI sources said last night that Mr Heseltine informed the prime minister that he would make reference to Lord Archer before issuing the statement on Thursday night. Mr Heseltine's decision followed a statement to the press by Anglia that a DTI investigation into the share deal was under way. Anglia said yesterday that it did not name Lord Archer in its press statement on Thursday. However, DTI officials emphasised that there was a clear indication in Anglia's statement that 'there was a specific investigation looking into a specific alleged transaction'. Mr John Watts, Tory chairman of the backbench Treasury and Civil Service committee, called on the DTI to issue 'a full and clear explanation' of its decision to disclose Lord Archer's identity. 'If they do not, it is something I would want to pursue in the House of Commons. There needs to be a full explanation of how and why this has happened.' Downing Street confirmed yesterday that Mr Major had known about the DTI investigation at the time of its inception in February. of this year. The prime minister, in Naples yesterday for the G7 summit of leading industrial nations, said: 'One always feels for an old friend. But I am not going to comment.' He added: 'There is an investigation going on. The investigation should proceed. It would be wrong for me to say anything beyond that.' The trade over Anglia shares was investigated by the Stock Exchange which then passed the evidence on to the Department of Trade and Industry, the prosecuting authority for insider dealing. The Stock Exchange surveillance department routinely examines trading in shares ahead of large price movements, particularly if it involves directors. Last year the Stock Exchange examined 450 such 'unusual trading patterns'. Very few of these are likely to result in prosecutions partly because insider dealing is a very difficult crime to prove. Legal experts believe that the circumstances surrounding the Anglia takeover would further hamper any successful prosecution. One leading City lawyer said: 'There was widespread speculation in the press that MAI was going to bid for Anglia so anyone accused of acting on inside information could use the defence that they were going to buy the shares anyway.' 'It is very difficult to prove what was in somebody's mind.' DTI under fire, Page 7 Takeover Panel annual report, Page 10 Lex, Page 24</p>

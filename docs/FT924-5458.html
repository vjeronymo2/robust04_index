			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Drive to boost Welsh lamb sales A NEW drive to highlight Welsh food products, with particular emphasis on lamb, was launched in Builth Wells yesterday by Welsh Food Promotions. 'If more food is to be sold to the trade and bought by the housewife it is essential that the image of the product is enhanced,' Mr Alun Evans, chairman, said at the opening of the first Taste of Wales Food Show. Yesterday's show, which is intended to become a biennial event at the Royal Welsh Showground in Builth Wells, was primarily aimed at shops and restaurants. It will be followed by a drive to bring the merits of Welsh food before the big supermarket buyers. Sainsbury has already committed itself to buying almost Pounds 1m worth of lamb and Mr Peter Budd, chief executive of the company, is working hard to woo chains such as Asda, Tesco and Safeway to stock Welsh products. Much of the emphasis yesterday was naturally on lamb as Wales has over 10m sheep and Mr Evans said that Welsh lamb deserved its quality premium. Lamb exports, especially to France, Spain and Italy, were rising satisfactorily and had gone up by a third in the past two months alone. This was before French farmers had threatened to dent the trade. A blockade against British imports this weekend is threatened as part of their opposition to the agreement on farm products just concluded between the European Commission and the US on farm products.</p>

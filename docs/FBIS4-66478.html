			<p>International   Science and Technology Center in Moscow Faces  Opposition   <F P=102> 94P60229C Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 25 Apr 94 p  17--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94P60229C </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] It has been revealed that the plutonium-related  project Japan was planning to promote at the International  Science and Technology Center (in Moscow) has been halted due to  the objection expressed by the U.S. The Center was created by  four major countries, Japan, US, Europe, and Russia to prevent  the outflow to other countries of scientists and engineers who  had been involved in the development of mass destruction weapons  in the former Soviet Union. It appears that the U.S. intends to  put a stop to the plutonium research effort of Japan and Russia.  This may cause considerable difficulty for Japan which is  promoting plutonium research on a global scale.    The United States is objecting to two subjects of the  research:    1) development of advanced fast reactors that use lead  instead of sodium coolant;    2) research on group partition of radioactive waste.    Japan proposed these topics in response to requests from the  Russians. The Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute is leading  the research cooperation efforts.    The Board of Directors of the International Science and  Technology Center met for the first time in Moscow on 17-18  March 1994. The U.S. Government informed the Japanese  Government just prior to the meeting of their ``objection to  adopt a project that promotes the use of plutonium in Russia.''    The reasons reported for their objections include:    1) fear of sloppy management of nuclear materials in Russia;    2) plutonium-related projects violate U.S. non-proliferation  policy.    In response to their objections, the Japanese side stated,  ``it would be inappropriate not to adopt all of the  plutonium-related projects because the Center' s objective is to  prevent scientists and engineers who have been involved in  plutonium developments from leaving the country.''    There was no official discussion held during the Beard of  Directors' meeting in March, but the projects in question were  kept on hold. On the other hand, 23 projects (valued at $12  million) including nuclear power safety technology which is not  directly related with plutonium use, were confirmed for the  first phase. Additional projects are supposed to be selected at  the next Board of Directors meeting in June 1994. The Japanese  government, in the mean time, will discuss with the U.S. side  the validity of the plutonium-related projects. Some government  sources are saying that a portion of the projects may have to be  revised in order to proceed with the projects smoothly.  <H5>  Greatly Cautious Toward Japan-Russia Cooperation </H5>   [Commentary] This latest U.S. pressure on project selection  at the International Science and Technology Center seems to have  been motivated by deep-rooted American caution over Japan' s  involvement with technologies related to mass destruction  weapons as well as differences between the two countries'  positions on the use of plutonium.    The Center has been established to provide research  opportunities for peaceful purposes and to encourage those  scientists and engineers who were involved in the development of  nuclear weapons and missiles to switch jobs. It is only natural  that doubts may arise about the possibility that weapons-related  information flowing from those experts in the course of  cooperation on plutonium-related projects with Japan.    On the other hand, Russia is eager to use plutonium for  non-military purposes and is very eager to cooperate with Japan.    The U.S. does not interfere with Japan using plutonium in  Japan. But it would oppose more active use of plutonium through  cooperation between Japan and Russia.    Japan has offered to invest $20 million, almost 1/3 of the  total funding for the International Science and Technology  Center. Japan is eager to absorb the fruits of Russian research  on fast reactors and plutonium. Those involved in promoting the  project may become highly frustrated if they are unable to  select research subjects freely because of US objections.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Gatt seeks to expand its HQ in Geneva High-level negotiations are taking place between the Swiss government and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on practical and financial arrangements for Gatt's change of status next year to a fully-fledged World Trade Organisation. Office accommodation, meeting facilities, parking and the issue of diplomatic status for senior officials top Gatt's list of concerns. Trade officials warned that if satisfactory arrangements were not made the WTO could look for another home. 'Negotiations are going fairly well. The Swiss recognise the need to keep the WTO in town,' one official said yesterday. Competition for international agencies, including financial inducements, has intensified in recent years, partly for reasons of prestige but also because of the boost to the local economy. International organisations and diplomats account for 9 per cent of employment in Geneva and bring in SFr1.5bn (Pounds 702m) a year to the Swiss city. Mr Arthur Dunkel, former Gatt director-general and now chairman of a new private foundation to promote Geneva as an international centre, is said to be playing a behind-the-scenes role in the negotiations. Office accommodation is one key factor. The size of the WTO's staff is certain to be much larger than the 450 now employed by Gatt. Gatt wants to expand into the whole of its present lakeside building, part of which is now occupied by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Though the UNHCR is due to move into purpose-built offices this September, these were planned when the agency was much smaller and there is now not enough room for all 800 headquarters employees. Berne has, however, already approved SFr34m to build a new WTO council room. The present one can no longer accommodate delegates from all Gatt's 116 member nations plus observers.</p>

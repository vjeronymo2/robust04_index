			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Tang Weibin (0781 5898 1755) and Jie Guoji </F> (6043 0948 6068)]    [Text] Zhengzhou, 22 May (XINHUA) -- Zhu Rongji, vice  premier and Standing Committee member of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau, respectively presided over a  discussion meeting in Wuhan on the economic work in Hubei,  Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi and in Zhengzhou on the economic work  in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan from 13 to 22 May. During this  period, he also inspected the production, purchase, and sale of  grain and cotton in Hubei and Henan. Zhu Rongji said  emphatically: To consolidate and develop the current good  economic situation and to maintain social stability, leading  comrades at all levels should focus their economic work on  improving agricultural production and state-owned enterprises.  At present, this is the key to correctly handling the relations  between reform, development, and stability. It is necessary to  conscientiously carry out various agricultural policies put  forward by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council,  fully arouse the peasants' enthusiasm for growing grain and  cotton, and strive for bumper harvests of both grain and cotton  to lay a solid material foundation for effectively bringing  prices under control. It is imperative to make thorough surveys  of the conditions of enterprises, help them solve their  problems, further deepen the reform of state-owned enterprises,  transform their operational mechanism, and make the experiment  in establishing a modern enterprise system successful.    Zhu Rongji carefully heard the briefings on current economic  work in these provinces. Responsible comrades from relevant  departments under the State Council gave a brief introduction to  the current national macroeconomic situation and a plan for  reforming the system of grain purchase and sale. Leading  comrades from Hubei and six other provinces, including Jia  Zhijie, Chen Bangzhu, Fu Xishou, Wu Guanzheng, Ye Liansong, Zhao  Zhihao, and Li Changchun, as well as responsible comrades from  relevant economic departments, attended the meeting.    Zhu Rongji fully affirmed the achievements made by Hubei and  other six provinces in deepening the reform, opening wider to  the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining  stability. He said: At present, the national economic situation  is very good and reforms in various fields are proceeding  smoothly and are being constantly improved. The new systems  have gradually become situated on the right track. Practice has  proved that the series of decisions on strengthening and  improving macroeconomic control and further deepening the reform  to restructure the economy made by the CPC Central Committee  with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core is fully correct and has  won support from the broad masses of the people and is highly  regarded by the world. The party committees and governments at  all levels have achieved marked results in conscientiously  carrying out the policies of the central authorities.    Zhu Rongji repeatedly stressed the importance of promoting  agriculture. He pointed out: In the first four months of this  year, the tendency toward excessive increases in investment in  fixed assets has been brought under control, the prices of  capital goods have started to fall again, and the supply of  industrial consumer goods is plentiful and the prices tend to be  stable. Therefore, the major tasks in bringing inflation under  control and maintaining social stability are to further  implement the spirit of the National Conference on Rural Work  and to promote the production of grain, cotton, edible oil, and  vegetables. If we achieve good result in this work, the market  will become stable and the prices will drop. At present, all  localities should try in every possible way to complete the  purchase of the summer crop's grain and oil- bearing farm  produce. They should strengthen the management of grain and  oil-bearing farm produce market, maintain normal purchase order,  and provide enough funds for purchasing grain and oil-bearing  farm produce. They should insist on the principle of not  issuing any IOU's.    Zhu Rongji said: At present, the tendency of the reform and  development of state-owned enterprises is good. Calculated in  terms of comparable items, the profits of the enterprises in the  first four months of this year did not drop but increased and  the percentage of enterprises with general debility decreased  rather than rising. This situation has become a major trend. A  few state- owned enterprises, mainly small and medium-sized  ones, are indeed faced with under-capacity operation or even  shut-downs. Judging from a recent investigation conducted by  the State Economic and Trade Commission and other relevant  departments in Beijing and 10 other provinces and  municipalities, as well as from the current investigation of  some enterprises in Wuhan and Huangshi, those enterprises which  are shut down or operate under capacity are indeed faced with  the problem of not having enough circulation funds. But the  major problems lie in the fact that some enterprises have  over-large production capacity and poor management, turn out  products without a ready market, that the funds used for  finished products increase, and that the default of payment  among enterprises has become serious. All these problems cannot  be solved by relaxing money supply or increasing loans. Leading  comrades at all levels and responsible persons of enterprises  should pay more attention to the changes in the market,  strengthen technological renovation, readjust product mix,  improve management, and resolutely carry out the principle of  "limiting production, reducing stockpiles, and promoting sales."    Zhu Rongji said emphatically: The fundamental solution to  the problems faced by the state-owned enterprises lies in  deepening the enterprise reform, changing the management  mechanism, and establishing a modern enterprise system which  meets the requirements of the market economy and in which the  property rights, as well as the rights and responsibilities of  enterprises, are clearly defined, government administration and  enterprise management are separated, and scientific management  is established. Regarding the shortage of circulation funds for  enterprises as reflected by all quarters, principal responsible  persons of economic departments and banks at all levels should  take the lead in going deep into the grass-roots units to make  surveys. Banks should render full support to enterprises whose  products have a ready market, whose product payments are  retrieval, and whose economic performances are good. Banks also  should provide loans to those enterprises that begin to  experience losses so as to help them make up deficits. As to  those state-owned enterprises which are shut down and have  problems paying wages to workers, both banks and local  governments should, in the light of maintaining social  stability, work together to help them resume production and get  out of these predicaments. As for those enterprises which have  recorded losses for a long period and have no hope to make up  deficits should declare bankruptcy according to the law after  making good preparations. Such practice should be experimented  in some areas first and then expanded to others. This will be  our way to promote the modern enterprise system.    During his stay in Hubei, Zhu Rongji, accompanied by Comrade  Jia Zhijie and other responsible comrades of the Hubei  Provincial CPC Committee and Government, inspected Hanchuan  county in the central part of the Jianghan Plain. He visited  peasants who were working or spraying insecticide in the  farmlands in Hongtang Village and Chenguang Village. He  conducted a study in Liuge Township on grain's selling price and  the management of the grain control office. During his stay in  Henan, Zhu Rongji, accompanied by Comrade Li Changchun and other  comrades of the Henan Provincial CPC Committee and Government,  inspected the production and sale of grain and cotton and the  technique of growing vegetables inside the plastic film sheds.  He also went to the Hubei provincial branch of the People's  Bank of China and the Henan provincial branch of the People's  Bank of China to see cadres and workers there.    Responsible comrades of relevant departments under the State  Council, including Han Shubin, Yao Zhenyan, Wang Chunzheng, Chen  Qingtai, Liu Zhifeng, Xiang Huaicheng, Wu Yixia, Bai Meiqing,  Liu Shanzai, Zhu Xiaohua, Ma Yongwei, Wang Xuebing, and Wang  Zhishan who were on the inspection team, also attended the  meeting.</p>

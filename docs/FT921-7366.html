			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Arts: Brave hang at the Tate FOR THE third time, the rehanging of the entire sequence of galleries that hold the permanent collections at the Tate is complete. There will now be a brief pause of a month or two before the whole process begins again. British Petroleum, which has sponsored this rolling rehang from the outset, has recommitted itself for a further two years, to make six in all. Change, renewal, permanent revolution: clearly there is to be no respite. At more or less mid-term, of both the programme and the initial period of office of the Tate's director, Nicholas Serota, with whom it is so closely identified, it is no bad moment to take stock. Any criticism or debate centres not upon any particular decision or peculiarity in the new hang, but upon general principle and the nature and limitations of the Tate itself as our national museum both of British art, historic and modern, and of international modern and contemporary art. I would make clear at once that so far as appearance is concerned, each gallery is beautifully hung, intriguing in the particular choice of works and, as often as not, offering real surprises. Overall the sense is of a spare and elegant arrangement, light and open. In particular, the early decision to open up the long central axis of the gallery's sculpture halls is again entirely vindicated. The Tate itself looks terrific. But here we must pause to ask the fundamental question: just how long can the fun continue? For fun it is and, which is usually the point with fun, self-indulgent. The Tate has far more works in its collections than it can ever show together. There is no scandal in this, for it is its statutory duty to monitor current change, development and innovation as well as to celebrate remarkable individual works and achievement. It must buy, buy, all the time; and while we might sometimes question what it does buy, we must concede that it could not be what it is meant to be without the buying. Space, therefore, is ever at a premium, and how wonderful it is to have these high and spacious galleries in which to show off the current selection to such advantage. But for how much longer may we justify so spare and brave a hang, so narrow a choice, so few works on the wall? To the knowledgeable and regular visitor, most of all perhaps the professional scholar, critic or artist, the Tate will remain, under its present policies, a real and ever-renewable treat. It is always a thrill to see a familiar work in a fresh and challenging context, to confront a major work by a forgotten artist never seen before, to respond to work too long critically neglected or discounted. This is all very well, but what is the interested but general visitor to make of it, with no special knowledge to sustain him? Where is the broader, encompassing survey to be found, to order and inform the sequence of displays, but in a book? For any museum to send the visitor back to his books for further stimulation is a kind of triumph: to require it of him in advance is perhaps to fail him. We, the professionals, know that what we now see at the Tate is but one possible view or sequence among many, equal but different from the last as from the next. But life is short and even we may despair of seeing them all. No Stanley Spencer, no Sickert, no Sutherland on current display, no Freud, no Albert Moore, no Giacometti, a mere four galleries given to work of the past 20 years, two of them to Joseph Beuys alone. And the treats? Room 3 full of Gainsborough at his most fresh and yet magisterial, and surely now the greatest British painter before Turner; Room 9 full of the Victorian academy, not just the pre-Raphaelites but Waterhouse and late Millais, who grows ever more interesting; Room 11 for narrative Victorian realism, Walker, Farquarson, Orchardson, Mason, Fildes; Room 23 for the British 1950s Kitchen Sink, with Peter Coker outstanding. There is indeed, so much to see and thoroughly enjoy. And may we look forward to something more settled, more regular and comprehensive as the hang rolls on: something, shall we say, a shade more permanent of the permanent collection?</p>

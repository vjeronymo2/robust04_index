Sergey Shakhray Advises  Attending to Chechen Problems"]    [Text] The "roundtable" on nationalities problems in  Moscow yesterday heard statements by Ramazan Abdulatipov,  Federation Council speaker; and Sergey Shakhray, nationalities  and regional policy minister. According to Ramazan Abdulatipov,  in the present situation it is necessary to study the problem of  self-determination of the Russian people and to devote a  separate scientific conference to the Russian question in  Russia. Sergey Shakhray formulated three principles of his  department's activity: National parity, self-organization, and  national paternalism. "I do not agree with the thesis that the  curve of interethnic conflicts in Russia is falling," Sergey  Shakhray stated. In his words, the ongoing division of  portfolios at the center has left the Russian regions to their  own devices. The nationalities minister believes that self-  organization by part of the Russian population in crisis areas  can bring about a situation where Russians also become an armed  party to interethnic conflicts. He said that the ministry will  form three subdivisions on three blocks of problems. The first  will deal exclusively with nationalities issues; the second,  with the financial and economic aspects of regional policy; and  the third, with northern problems.    Responding to a question about his attitude to Chechnya,  Sergey Shakhray stated that the federal power bodies must  finally express their position on this issue, not sweep it under  the rug. He thinks that at present the Chechen Republic is part  of the Russian Federation de jure but in fact has no economic or  political links with Russia, only criminal ones. A preliminary  condition for the start of negotiations with Groznyy, according  to the minister, should be free democratic elections to power  bodies in the Chechen Republic, necessarily with opposition  participation. Sergey Shakhray cited the pending treaty with  Tatarstan as an example of constructive cooperation between the  center and the regions and the building of a new federal policy.  In his opinion, such treaties are the sole possible method of  removing contradictions between the Russian Federation  constitution and the constitutions of the republics.</p>

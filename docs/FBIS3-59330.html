Developmental Characteristics of Foreign  Commercial Investment Enterprises    In recent years, the Fujian Provincial Committee and the  provincial government have announced a series of important  measures for opening and reform, which have taken the work of  using foreign investment to a new level of development. In just  1992 alone, there were 3,113 foreign commercial investment  enterprises approved throughout the province, with contracts for  $6.351 billion in foreign capital, actual use of foreign capital  amounting to $1.416 billion. These three quotas indicated,  respectively, increases of 1.6 times, 3.4 times, and 1.2 times  again over the previous year. From January to July of this year,  2,998 new foreign investment enterprises were approved  throughout the province, with contracts for $7.203 billion in  foreign capital, and $1.58 billion in capital actually received.  These were, respectively, increases of 1.41 times, 2.63 times,  and 1.42 times again over the same period last year.    In recent years, the development of foreign investment  enterprises in Fujian has had the following new special features:    A. Foreign investors were mostly the "three types of  overseas  Chinese," i.e., Chinese in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and foreign  countries, with a steady increase in investors from other  countries and regions. Eight million overseas Chinese came from  Fujian, as did 800,000 residents of Hong Kong and Macao, and 80  percent of Taiwanese' residents' original family home was  Fujian. With expanded opening up to the outside and improvement  of the conditions for investment, they have been eager to invest  in their hometowns, and have become the main body of foreign  investment in Fujian Province. Up to July, 1993, investors from  32 countries or regions had invested in Fujian. If calculating  on a basis of approved contracted foreign capital, capital from  Hong Kong and Macao constituted 55.8 percent of the total,  capital from Taiwan made up 24.9 percent, with 19.3 percent  coming from other foreign countries and regions. In recent  years, industrial and commercial business people from Europe,  the United States, and Southeast Asia have had optimistic views  of the excellent investment circumstances in Fujian, so  investors increased rapidly. Among newly approved investment  projects in 1992, 54 were American, with contracted capital  amount to $144 million; nine were Canadian, with contracted  capital amounting to $36.66 million; 65 were from Singapore,  with contracted capital amounting to $200 million; 73 were from  the Philippines, with contracted capital amounting to $149  million; 17 were Malaysian, with contracted capital amounting to  $41.63 million; 17 were Indonesian, with contracted capital  amounting to $34.2 million.    B. There was an increase in the number of major foreign  investment projects, a big breakthrough in attracting major  investors. In recent years, there have been many achievements in  the work of inviting tenders, resulting in a series of visits to  Fujian by some large financial groups with considerable  influence overseas, and some important industrial business  people. These were to negotiate investment in large scale  construction and development. Preliminary statistics indicate  that there are 10 major investment projects throughout the  province which have gross capital of more than $100 million, and  163 investment projects with over $10 million in capital. What  is especially inspiring is that these big financial groups and  investors have shifted from mostly checking out the investment  environment into an actual development and construction period.  The success rate of negotiations is higher, projects are  implemented quickly, and one by one a large group of major  projects have commenced establishment and operations. There are  38 major projects of over $10 million which have gone into  production in Fuzhou, and most of the big projects in such  cities as Xiameng, Quanzhou, Putian, and Zhangzhou, have gone  into production one by one. Foreign capital investment  construction along the entire first line of the coastal area is  displaying a robust situation.    C. The scope of foreign capital investment has expanded  further, with the direction of capital developing toward  tertiary industries. Since 1992, foreign capital investment has  developed into multiple areas, in projects involved with over 90  industries, including agriculture, forestry, poultry, fisheries,  the feed industry, coal industry, metallurgy, building  materials, electricity, mechanical manufactures, textiles, shoe  manufacturing, plastic products, bamboo and wood processing,  furniture, paper manufacturing, the chemical industry, chemical  fibers, printing, traffic, transportation, electric power, real  estate, food, hotel information inquiry, health, sports,  literature and art, broadcasting and television, public affairs,  and finance, etc. In particular, pushed by the reform and  opening in China and guided by industrial policies, some big  business people have not hesitated to put considerable amounts  of money into renewal of the older districts of cities, helping  to develop such public concerns as traffic, electric power, etc.  and vigorously developing such tourism and shopping facilities  as hotels, shopping centers, retail sales outlets, holiday  villages, high class vocation centers, large scale entertainment  places, etc., which touched off a wave of tertiary industry  development. Looking at the industrial structure of foreign  investment, among the currently approved amount of foreign  capital, 1.9 percent went into primary industry, 67.8 percent  went into secondary industry, and 36.8 percent went to tertiary  industry. The rate of investment for this tertiary capital had  obviously increased.    D. The open coastal areas dominate investment distribution,  but this is gradually spreading toward the mountainous regions  inland. Fujian's open coastal area has very favorable  conditions, such as nearness to Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan,  convenient traffic and favorable policies, etc., so it is still  a hot spot for foreign investment. Up the end of July, 1993,  among 11,038 foreign investment projects throughout the  province, the city of Fuzhou had 2,516 projects, with agreements  for $7.52 billion in foreign capital, and $663 million in  foreign capital actually in use; Xiamen had 2,009 projects, with  $5.286 billion in foreign capital agreed upon, and $1.286  billion actually in use; Quanzhou had 3,386 projects, with  agreements for $4.06 billion in foreign capital, and $583  million actually in use; Putian had 654 projects, with  agreements on $1.748 billion in foreign capital, and $234  million in foreign capital actually in use; Zhangzhou had 978  projects, with agreements on $1.33 billion in foreign capital,  and $212 million in foreign capital actually in use. With the  overall investment environment improved and the open areas  expanded, foreign investment has moved steadily inland to the  mountainous region from the coastal area, there has been a rapid  increase in the number of investors engaged in mining, forestry,  tourism, etc., and a group of foreign investment projects have  developed along the mountain railway line. Among these, Longyan  had 328 projects, with agreements on $318 million in foreign  capital, and $40.23 million in foreign capital actually in use;  Ningde had 354 projects, with agreements on $261 million in  foreign capital, and $83.92 million in foreign capital actually  in use; Shanmin had 347 projects, with agreements on $210  million, and $33.24 million in foreign capital actually in use.    E. Investment form was initially the single project type,  but  gradually developed into a series of developments, opening up  regionally. In the early part of the 1980s, foreign commercial  investment in Fujian was dominated by scattered manufacturers,  with single projects. In the middle and later years of that  decade, there appeared a series of trade developments, and in  the 1990s regional development has taken a more complete form,  with land packet development becoming an important pattern in  foreign commercial investments. Up to the end of May, 1993, the  province had approved 79 parcels of land for foreign commercial  development projects. The contracted amount of land to be  developed in these areas in the near term is 48.34 square  kilometers, with $1.828 billion in foreign capital. In these  parcels of development areas, the imported projects will have a  higher starting point, with complete supporting public  facilities such as water, electricity, roads, posts and  telecommunications, pollution control, etc., and most of  projects can be developed and built in the time framework  specified in the contracts. At present, 34 projects are under  construction, and 12 projects, including Rongqiao, Hongkuan,  Yuanzai, Majia, Panlong, and Zhenshi, have gone into production  or are close to completion. Basically, the pattern followed has  been rolling development -- develop a packet, construct a  packet, then profit from it. Take for example, the Rongqiao  Economic and Technical Development Zone in the city of Fuqin:  during the five years after it was established, the State put  only 2 million yuan into it, while foreign investors put in $596  million yuan; an enterprise group was formed in the development  area, which established and constructed 107 foreign capital  enterprises, and 58 enterprises had gone into production, with  forecast earnings of 2.5 billion yuan annually, and $300 million  in foreign currency. Also, in Fuqin's Hongyuan Investment Zone,  since it was established over one year ago, 10 square kilometers  were developed in the first phase, and 17 initial projects were  listed in the plan, a large group of projects, including a  flower mill, paper manufacturer, a petroleum plant, etc. In an  intense campaign of preparation for the establishment and  construction of a 30,000 ton port, they are building an  infrastructure in the zone, such as water, electricity, posts,  roads, etc., and a start has been made on all of these.    F. It accelerates gathering foreign commercial investment  enterprises into groups, and further improves their technical  and managerial level. In recent years, some foreign commercial  investment enterprises have gradually developed into groups on  the basis of making higher profits. Large groupings of powerful  enterprises have organized and built up enterprise groups, such  as the Fuyao Glass Industry Corporation, Ltd., and Yongdexing  Corporation, Ltd., continuously enlarging the enterprises'  degree of grouping. In cities where foreign enterprises are  concentrated, there has been formed a pattern of trade  association and specialization alleys. Foreign capital  enterprises in Jinjiang are enthusiastically applying themselves  to building a "shoe city," a regional shoe production center and  large scale specialized shoe trade market which will spread  across the country with production, operations, wholesale and  retail sales all combined in one entity. In Fujiang's open  coastal areas, there has been a wave of development, a "shoe  city," "fashion city," "umbrella city," "toy city," "packing  city," etc., with different special features. In addition, the  technical structure of foreign investment enterprises has  obviously improved. A group of enterprises concentrated as to  technology and capital were established in succession in the  past several years. Take for example, the Guanjie Electricity  Enterprise in Fuqing: its imported electric terminal indicator  production line can produce 200,000 terminal indicators per  year; the high technical level of its facility and the size of  its production scale can be termed first class in the same  industry in the nation. With enterprises becoming more  specialized and automated, many foreign investment enterprises  are computerizing their routine management operations, inviting  a large number of people with specialized qualifications and  knowledge of modern enterprise management. Their attention to  building an enterprise culture has brought their operations and  management to a new level.    G. Gaining considerable notice has been the high rate of  independent capital enterprises and the phenomenon of state  owned enterprises "grafting" foreign capital to increase the  proportion of independent capital investment. At present, it  occupies 60.7 percent of foreign capital enterprises. All of  Fujian's prefectures and cities have also selected a group of  state-owned enterprises to "graft" foreign capital, implementing  multiple forms of joint ventures in plants, workshops, foreign  investor purchasing, leasing and foreign investor contracting,  importing the operational system of foreign capital enterprises.  The Hong Kong Zhongche Investment Corporation, Ltd., is carrying  out a joint venture with 41 state-owned enterprises in the city  of Quanzhou, which will be a "total" remolding, with a total  investment of 1 billion yuan. This action has had the positive  effect of alleviating the financial burden on Quanzhou's city  government, changing the operating system of state-owned  enterprises, promoting Quanzhou's state-owned enterprises,  readjusting and promoting the level of industrial structure.  This has attracted attention from all sectors.  II. We Cannot Ignore the Role That Development of Foreign  Investment Enterprises Has Played in Fujian's Booming Economy  and Social Progress    The abrupt rise of foreign investment enterprises in Fujian  has had a positive effect in promoting Fujian's opening and  reform and socioeconomic development, chiefly manifested as:    A. Furthering the adjustment and perfecting of the socialist  ownership structure, bringing new motivation and vitality to  development of the domestic economy. The rapid development of  foreign investment enterprises has fostered new competition in  the main body of the domestic economic system, and causing the  single ownership structure in Fujian province to start to shift  to a multiple level ownership structure in which the public  ownership system is dominant. It has formed a new developmental  pattern in which state ownership, collective, township, foreign  capital, individual, and private ownership enterprises promote  and spur on one another, and stimulated the domestic economy's  rapid development. During January to July of this year, Fujian  had a gross output of 46.154 billion yuan in agriculture and  industry, an increase of 36.6 percent over last year, including  16.11 billion yuan industrial output achieved by foreign  investment enterprises, a 56.8 percent increase, and 35 percent  of the province's industrial output above the township level.  Among newly added industry in the province, foreign investment  enterprises occupied 47.4 percent. The arrival of a great many  foreign enterprises has become the conduit for efficient  allocation between the international and domestic markets, and  for two types of resources, in such industries as electricity,  shoe manufacture, building materials, machinery, light industry,  the food trade, etc. Foreign investment enterprises and the  state-owned, collective, and township enterprises are supporting  each other to form a batch of close or semi-close joint stock  enterprise groups guided by the international market, centered  on export products, and linked by economic benefits. To take  the shoe industry as an example, foreign investment enterprises  took eight world famous sports shoes as their chief product, and  brought the products of more than 1,000 State owned, collective,  and township shoe manufacturing enterprises into the  international market.    B. Accelerating readjustment of industrial structure,  promoting improvement and replacement of product mix. The  development of foreign investment enterprises has presented new  challenges and vitality to industrial structure adjustment in  Fujian, remolding and developing not only such traditional  industries as electricity, shoe manufacturing, clothing, toys,  gold and silver jewelry, beverages, feed, machine processing,  medicinal chemistry, etc., but also appearing in a batch of new  products which are suitable for both domestic and overseas  markets. These industries, which include electricity, plastics  and rubber, shoe manufacturing, building materials, and clothing  manufacturing, etc., have become mainstay industries in Fujian.  This has greatly accelerated the process of industrial structure  adjustment, and improved the structure and distribution of  trade. The boom in foreign investment enterprises has led to the  replacement of a group of older enterprises in Fujian,  refinement and distillation of traditional technology, and  brought the quality, design, modeling, and packing of products  to a new level. A large group of products have won either the  international gold prize, or the national, ministry, and  provincial titles for excellence, and are selling well in the  domestic and overseas markets.    C. Increasing the state's revenue income, promoting the  public matters of society's development. There has been an  annual increase in the amount of revenue from foreign investment  enterprises throughout the province, and these have become an  important channel of Fujian's revenue. In 1992, 1.1 billion yuan  in various revenues were turned over by foreign investment  enterprises, which was one-seventh of the provincial revenue  income; this is expected to rise to 1.4 billion yuan in 1993. In  addition, numerous foreign investors have enthusiastically aided  in the development of such societal welfare and public affairs  matters as education, health, sports, cultural, roads and  electric power, etc. They have been generous with contributions  of money or materials, and have made greater contributions to  the modernization of their hometowns.    D. Importing a batch of advanced technology and equipment,  promoting a scientific and technical boom. In recent years, the  direction of foreign capital investment has begun shifting from  labor intensive industries to capital and technology intensive  industries. The technical level and amount of science and  technology in imported equipment has improved greatly, with some  enterprises imported facilities and technology attaining the  international advanced level of the 1990s, so it has greatly  accelerated the pace of Fujian industry's becoming more  scientific and technical. Meanwhile, foreign invested  enterprises have invited a large number of scientific and  technical personnel to China, combining their favorable capital  situation with the cheap science and technology of the mainland,  in an advantageous merger to cooperate on preparing new  technology and developing new products, to produce a very strong  competitive power in the international market. It can be said  that foreign investment enterprises have been in the forefront  of enterprise technical progress in Fujian Province, and the  "point man" in promoting scientific industry in the province.    E. Development of an export-oriented economy, promoting  links  between the economy of Fujian and the international market.  Foreign investment enterprises are Fujian's bridge and link to  the outside, and are an important pillar of Fujian's export  oriented economy. Among Fujian's 4,300 foreign investment  enterprises which have gone into production, as many as 3,000  are export enterprises. Through their flexible operating system,  foreign investment enterprises rapidly linked international and  domestic production features, producing goods which promptly  entered the international market, rapidly promoting foreign  trade and export increases in Fujian. Among a $4.2 billion  foreign trade and expert volume in the province in 1992, the  self operated exports of foreign investment enterprises was  $1.814 billion, which was 42.43 percent of the gross provincial  exports; among gross provincial exports of $2.812 billion during  January to July of this year, the self operated exports of  foreign investment enterprises was $1.389 billion, which was 49  percent of the gross. Of the surplus in the balance of foreign  exchange, in 1992, $567 million was transferred to the market,  and $279 was paid in, making for a foreign exchange net of $288  million. Foreign investment enterprises' management model and  operating systems were affected chiefly by international  practice and adjustment of international market operational  regulations, and had a positive learning effect on speeding up  enterprise reform in Fujian and building the socialist market  economy. Some of the state-owned, collective, and township  enterprises in Fujian imported the scientific management model  of foreign investment enterprises, but insisted that there be  the following preconditions: public ownership and distribution  according to work; establishment of an operations system with  responsibility; rights and profits be unified; implementation of  regularized production and management, standarized technological  management, and systematic personnel management. All operations  and management had to comply with international practice which  improved production and economic benefits of enterprises, and  laid a good foundation for connecting Fujian's provincial  economy with the international market as soon as possible after  joining GATT.    F. Wider channels and means of employment, and easing the  societal pressures from job-seeking. So far, the province's  foreign investment enterprises have hired 530,000 employees,  which was 9.8 percent of hires in all of society. The rapid  development of foreign investment enterprises not only brought  jobs to a great many of the urban unemployed, but also made use  of a large group of rural society's surplus labor force. This  played an important role in reducing the State's investment in  employment, easing societal pressures from job-seeking an  promoting social stability.    G. Promoting the concept of opening among the people of  Fujian Province, and building closer relationships with the Hong  Kong, Macao, and Taiwan region and with neighboring countries.  The development of foreign investment enterprises has promoted  the concepts of opening and the market economy among the people  of Fujian, nurturing and training a group of talented,  export-oriented people familiar with international economics and  trade, and good at operations and management. Meanwhile,  building closer contacts between Fujian and with the people of  Hong Kong and Taiwan, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United  States, has strengthened mutual understanding and friendship,  which was helpful to the country's unification and peace, and  has been helpful in promoting direct and early "three  communications" between the two banks of the straits, as well as  being helpful in consolidating and developing warm friendships  with neighboring countries.    Overall, after 15 years' of reform and opening to the  outside, foreign investment enterprises have continued to widen  the spheres of their operations, and with the rapid expansion of  the scope of their operations, and development of their economic  power, they have become an important pillar of the Fujian  provincial economy, having a decisive effect on such fields as  industry, real estate, hotel services, etc., and the city  construction trade in Fujian province, and have been an  indispensable force in Fujian's modernization. The 15 years of  hard work not only embodies the hard work of vast numbers of  cadres and masses, but also the enthusiastic support and  contributions of compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and  also foreign investors, a positive development. The  establishment and development of foreign investor groups has  been a leading factor in our flourishing economy and our social  development.</p>

She said: "Cross-border operations have  taken place."    While flying to Adana to attend the True Path Party meeting,  Ciller answered a MILLIYET correspondent's question about the  credibility of reports that the security forces have crossed  into Syria by asserting: "Cross-border operations take place on  our eastern border from time to time. We shall continue to take  the measures required to end terrorism. The question of  cross-border operations is always on Turkey's agenda. It will  continue to be on the agenda."    Asked whether the border between Turkey and Iraq was  included  in the plans for the cross-border operation, Ciller said: "We  have informed our neighbors not to attach too much importance to  the air and ground operations. Penetrations have been made into  Turkey from Iraq, but they were insignificant. Turkey is fourth  on the list of countries with many neighbors. It is time for  Turkey's neighbors to prove their friendship with our country.  This year will be one in which the important stages of this  issue will be wrapped up." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee futures rally - Market report COFFEE futures closed firmer in London yesterday after a choppy run marked by producer selling and trade and arbitrage buying, dealers said. 'The market was erratic in thin trade but it did perform better than expected this morning,' one said. By the close the November position at the London Commodity Exchange, which had earlier dipped to Dollars 4,053 a tonne, stood at Dollars 4,091, within Dollars 9 of the day's high. The latest weather forecast from the US-based Weather Services Corporation, which said Brazil's hot, dry weather was expected to continue through the next five days, added a sense of urgency to the market, a trader said. A mid-afternoon rise in London Metal Exchange base metals was not maintained and when COPPER stalled most other prices lost their way. Three months ALUMINIUM recorded a fresh 3 3/4 -year high of Dollars 1,624 a tonne before profit-taking and speculative selling snuffed out the move. NICKEL prices mostly fluctuated in line with the overall trend. LEAD continued to make slow progress back up to the Dollars 630-a-tonne level and another attempt at recent 2-year highs.

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Son of Hyundai founder held SOUTH Korean prosecutors yesterday arrested a son of the founder of Hyundai as the government continued its feud with the country's second largest conglomerate. Mr Chung Mong-Hun, vice-chairman of Hyundai Merchant Marine, was arrested for tax evasion after a two-week investigation of Korea's biggest shipping company. Prosecutors said they originally suspected that some of the Won11.2bn (Dollars 14.5m) hidden from tax authorities was used to finance the anti-government Unification National party but found no evidence to support this theory.

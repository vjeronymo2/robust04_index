			<p>BFN     [Text] Belarus intends to propose considering the division  of non-military ships of the former USSR's fleet at a CIS  summit. As Interfax learned in the press service of the CIS  Executive Secretariat, at the initiative of the Belarussian side  a meeting of CIS experts is scheduled for next week to discuss  this issue.    In the meantime, a high-ranking official of the Belarussian  Foreign Ministry, who requested anonymity, told Interfax "this  idea most probably will be once again killed, because the states  who are currently owners of non-military ships of the former  USSR are unlikely to allow this issue to be put on the agenda of  a CIS summit."    The source believes that a significant number of former  Soviet non-military ships have already been privatized or  mothballed for a long term. In his opinion, "the time to  achieve the fleet's division may have been irreversibly missed."</p>

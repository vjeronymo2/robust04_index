			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Gains all round at hectic LME A hectic week at the London Metal Exchange ended yesterday with most contracts holding on to the bulk of their gains. Copper met with some profit-taking after the exchange announced a substantial rise in warehouse stocks of the metal. In contrast, an exceptionally large fall in aluminium stocks encouraged a fresh wave of buying. The copper market had been the leader of the upsurge, the three months position soaring to a four-year high of Dollars 2,860 a tonne with a Dollars 100-plus advance on Wednesday. By yesterday's close it had retreated to Dollars 2,827.50 a tonne, but that was still Dollars 145 up on the week. Analysts saw good fundamental reasons for copper's recent strength. There was concern, however, that a heavy fall could ensue when the investment funds, whose buying has been a particular feature of this year's climb, decided to take their profits. Mr Ted Arnold, analysts at Merrill Lynch, said it would be reasonable to expected a great deal of profit-taking by December 16 so that the funds could include the benefits in their December-quarter results. Another concern was that the copper market was being manipulated, a view encouraged by the establishment recently of substantial premiums for nearby delivery positions, a reversal of the normal situation. The LME was monitoring the copper market more closely than usual, chief executive David King confirmed this week. The exchange it has the power to intervive if it believes a 'disorderly' market is developing. The prospect of an exodus of investment fund money is also hanging over the aluminium market. But with stocks continuing to fall rapidly as production cuts agreed earlier this year work through traders do not seem unduely worried. At yesterday's close the three months LME price was quoted at Dollars 1,970.75 a tonne, only Dollars 8.25 below the four-year peak reached in the morning, and up Dollars 116.25, or 6.4 per cent, since the end of last week. Dealers told the Reuters news agency that the aluminium market seemed to be winding-up for an attack on its next overhead objective of Dollars 2,000 a tonne. Other notable performances at the LME this week were three months zinc's push through Dollars 1,200 a tonne, for the first time in two years, and lead's brief foray above Dollars 700 a tonne. Nickel also did well. Though more than Dollars 100 below Wednesday's peak, the three months price's closing quotation of Dollars 7,722.50 a tonne represented an overall gain of Dollars 307.50. The price had fallen sharply with copper on Thursday but rallied yesterday, despite the denial of early talk that Russia's Norilsk plant, the world's biggest, was suffering production problems. At the London Commodity Exchange coffee prices tumbled to the lowest levels since mid-August as the market responded to weakness in New York. The January futures position ended yesterday at Dollars 3,280 a tonne, down Dollars 72 on the day and Dollars 191 on the week. The price has now fallen Dollars 320 since last week's official projection put the Brazil's frost- and drought-hit 1995-96 crop at between 12.7m and 14.8m bags (60kg each), broadly in line with market forecasts. A trader told Reuters yesterday that coffee roasters appeared to be buying at the lows, but added: 'They aren't willing to chase the market up'. On the other hand, he said he had not noticed any evidence of producer selling.  ---------------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ---------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium              -49,725    to    1,908,175 Aluminium alloy           +160    to       26,680 Copper                  +7,700    to      323,225 Lead                    -4,875    to      361,625 Nickel                     -60    to      150,432 Zinc                    -2,075    to    1,212,125 Tin                         +5    to       28,995  ----------------------------------------------------------</p>

Elevated counts during the 1920's may have been due to ranching activities or poor sanitary disposal of human wastes, as well as natural sources (Librach,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Factors Affecting the Species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the Barton Springs salamander ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eurycea sosorum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The primary threat to the Barton Springs salamander is contamination of the waters that feed Barton Springs. A discussion of some potential effects of contaminants on the salamander and its prey base (amphipods) is provided in this section and under Factor D. Potential factors contributing to contamination of this portion of the Edwards Aquifer are catastrophic events (such as hazardous material spills) and chronic degradation resulting from urban activities. Water quality degradation can result from point-source and/or non-point-source pollution. Point-source pollution originates from identifiable areas, such as leaking pipelines. Non-point-source pollution enters the water supply through diffuse sources, such as runoff from urban areas. The EPA (1990) and TWC (1989) have identified several major potential sources of groundwater contamination, including leaking underground storage tanks, pipelines, septic tanks, and pesticide and fertilizer use. Other threats to the salamander are disturbances to its surface habitat and reduced groundwater supplies owing to increased groundwater withdrawal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to the Barton Springs salamander's restricted range, one or more catastrophic spills has the potential to impact the entire species and its habitat. Catastrophic spills may result from leaking underground storage tanks, pipeline ruptures, transportation accidents, and/or other sources. Spilled materials reported to the TWC for Travis and Hays counties between 1986 and 1992 included oils, sewage, pesticides, ammonia, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, ferrous sulfate, trichloroethane, and perchloroethene. About a third of the spills involved gasoline or diesel fuel, most of which resulted from underground storage tank leaks and transportation accidents. Leaking underground storage tanks ``are considered to be one of the most significant sources of groundwater contamination'' in Texas (TWC 1989). The Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) (1987) has estimated that thousands of underground storage tanks in Texas may be leaking. According to the EPA (1990), ``a growing problem of substantial potential consequences is leakage from underground storage tanks and from pipelines leading to them *&blank;*&blank;* gasoline leakage has caused severe hazardous difficulties throughout the nation.'' The EPA (in TWC 1989) has estimated that at least 25 percent of the underground storage tanks in Texas ``will ultimately be confirmed as leakers.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the TWC (1989), ``substances spilled on the land surface can be a serious threat if the surface and subsurface materials are sufficiently permeable to permit downward movement'' and if spilled materials are not promptly or adequately remediated. Transportation accidents involving hazardous materials at bridge crossings are of particular concern, since creek beds can transport spilled materials directly into the aquifer. For example, if a contaminant spill occurred at the Loop 360 bridge crossing over Barton Creek, less than 5 kilometers (3 miles) south of Barton Springs, the contaminant could reach Barton Springs within hours. The Barton Springs Task Force report to the TWC (City of Austin 1991) states that ``the major fault that creates the discharge for Barton Springs crosses Barton Creek in the vicinity of Loop 360 and appears to be a significant point of recharge which may provide direct transmission, similar to pipe flow, to the Springs.'' Loop 360 provides a major route for transportation of petroleum and gasoline products to service stations in the Austin area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

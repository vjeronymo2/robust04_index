			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An overall concern raised by many State and local correctional administrators both in written comments and at the public hearings addressed the degree to which these guidelines rely on specific design requirements in establishing a minimum level of accessibility. These guidelines, many correctional authorities maintained, should not address accessibility solely in terms of design criteria but should take into account operational and program alternatives and considerations that are inherent within State and local detention and correctional systems. Further, commenters argued that these guidelines should afford operators the flexibility and discretion considered necessary to effectively and efficiently provide access. Many correctional systems already have certain procedures and policies in place that determine how and where access is provided within the system. Thus, many corrections administrators considered it important that the guidelines acknowledge existing alternatives, including those of an operational nature, instead of mandating access strictly in terms of architectural specifications for buildings and facilities. This point was emphasized in relation to the required number and location of accessible cells and is further discussed below in ADAAG 12.4 (Holding and Housing Cells or Rooms: Minimum Number and Dispersion). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is understood that correctional administrators may oversee an entire State- or city-wide system and are responsible for its programs and services, not just its buildings and facilities. Accessibility is not solely a matter of architectural design. However, the Board's statutory mandate is to ensure accessibility of the built environment in the case of new construction or alterations. Consequently, these and other guidelines the Board has issued under the ADA must address accessibility in terms of architectural design in new construction and alterations. The ADA does not give the Board the authority to address programs or services or existing buildings, except in the case of alterations. The Department of Justice is responsible under the ADA for addressing programs and services in the public sector. See 28 CFR part 35. The Department of Justice's regulation, consistent with the statute, focuses on program access and allows the level of flexibility and discretion desired by detention and corrections operators in providing accessibility in existing buildings and facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Still, some comments stressed that flexibility was essential in new construction as well. For example, some corrections officials were concerned about the guidelines requiring accessibility in new jails or prisons that, under current assignment policies or procedures, would not be intended to house inmates with disabilities. The Board's statutory mandate severely limits the degree to which operational or procedural alternatives can be addressed in guidelines that must specify a minimum level of architectural accessibility. Existing inmate assignment or placement policies may have to be reconsidered in relation to general prohibitions of discrimination based on disability set forth in the ADA and the Department of Justice's regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some comments recommended that these guidelines outline a minimum level of accessibility in general terms by specifying the desired result or ``end'' and allowing operators the opportunity to determine the ``means'' or methods of meeting it. Such an approach would be inconsistent with the requirements of other special application sections of this rule as well as those guidelines previously issued for the private sector under title III of the ADA. Furthermore, incorporating flexibility into a design guideline must be weighed against clearly and precisely detailing the requirements for building access for the benefit of architects and designers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 12.1&blank;General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section covers both detention facilities, such as holding cells in police stations, and correctional facilities, such as prisons and reformatories. Generally, detention facilities are used to hold persons apprehended or arrested for alleged violations of law, whereas correctional facilities typically house those persons who have been found guilty of a crime and have been incarcerated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments called attention to the differences that exist between the types of facilities covered by this section. Basic differences between detention facilities and correctional facilities in their mission and use lead to differences in fundamental aspects of their design, as well as their size, and the populations they serve.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In both proposing and issuing these interim final guidelines, the Board recognized the wide range of facilities covered by this section, from small jails in rural areas to major prisons in extensive State systems such as California's which, according to its Department of Corrections, house over 100,000 inmates and feature large self-contained sites that operate like a ``small city.'' Comments on how a requirement may impact facilities of a certain type in particular were carefully considered and proposed provisions altered accordingly. For example, specifications for certain elements, such as beds, which are typically provided in correctional housing cells but not detention holding cells, are applicable only where the element is provided; additionally, exceptions to certain requirements based on necessary security considerations are stated generally even though in practice they may be applicable only to correctional facilities, or portions thereof, with a significant level of security. Consequently, this section has not been subdivided according to facility type. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The types of facilities covered by this section include those institutional occupancies where occupants other than employees are under some degree of restraint or restriction for security reasons. The NPRM asked whether certain mental institutions, such as those housing persons considered to be criminally insane, should be addressed by this section or by ADAAG 6 (Medical Care Facilities), which contains a reference to ``psychiatric facilities.'' A majority of the responses recommended that these facilities should be covered by ADAAG 6. This opinion was shared by State and local government agencies, the National Institute of Corrections, and several design professionals. Some State correctional authorities indicated that inmates may receive psychiatric treatment in State hospital facilities that are clearly medical care occupancies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A slightly smaller number of responses recommended that the guidelines address mental institutions in both ADAAG 6 and ADAAG 12 or allow use of either section. For example, the Paralyzed Veterans of America recommended using ADAAG 6 for such occupancies in general and ADAAG 12 for institutions serving persons found criminally insane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several comments from the operators of correction systems and the Bureau of Prisons recommended coverage of these facilities in ADAAG 12 due to certain security considerations more typical of a detention or correctional facility than of a medical occupancy. The City of New York shared this opinion and noted that its Department of Corrections has jurisdiction over such facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

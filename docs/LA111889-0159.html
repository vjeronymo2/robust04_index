			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> SIMMERING RIVALRY BOILS AGAIN  </P> <P> The Rivalry Continues, in more ways than one would suspect.  </P> <P> At the moment, there seems to be a rivalry as to just how big the rivalry  really is.  </P> <P> "I've never really thought of it as a rivalry," says Bret Johnson, representing  UCLA, El Toro High School and little quarterbacks everywhere. "Obviously, the  papers labeled it that. But when we played, I didn't think about competing  against Todd. I just thought about a win."  </P> <P> Rebuttal to Todd Marinovich, wearing the colors of USC, Capistrano Valley High  and the Marv Marinovich School of CompuQuarterbacks.  </P> <P> "Oh, there's a little tension," Marinovich says. "Some things have been said,  some things that I can't really repeat. Things he said -- to me and to others.  That's kind of affected it."  </P> <P> Bret and Todd, butting heads again.  </P> <P> By any designation -- cold war, uneasy truce, grudging acquaintance -- the  Johnson-Marinovich relationship hasn't progressed much since the fall of 1987,  since they last vied for national honor, personal pride and the South Coast  League championship.  </P> <P> They still call the same city home, but Mission Viejo can be as big and as  insular as one wants to make it.  </P> <P> For years they shared the same quarterback coach, but Bill Cunerty still can't  talk them into sharing dinner.  </P> <P> And now, as they prepare for their first clash as starting quarterbacks at UCLA  and USC, Johnson and Marinovich still can't resist the long-distance needle,  still keenly aware of the other's pressure points.  </P> <P> Such as Johnson's height.  </P> <P> "I think they must be feeding him bad at UCLA," Marinovich says with a sly  grin. "In high school, he was listed at 6-2. Now he's 6-0."  </P> <P> Or Marinovich's upbringing as Robo-QB.  </P> <P> "He and his father worked very hard at getting Todd to where he is now,"  Johnson pointedly points out.  </P> <P> Or Johnson's lack of success as quarterback with the 3-7 Bruins during the  worst season UCLA has had since 1963.  </P> <P> "I can't figure it out," Marinovich says, straight-faced. "They recruited at  least 15 high school All-Americans. I can't figure out what it's been."  </P> <P> What's left unsaid is the success Marinovich has experienced across town. USC  is headed for the Rose Bowl. Marinovich, a redshirt freshman forced into the  starting lineup when Pat O'Hara was injured, has completed 63% of his passes  and has thrown for 2,246 yards, which already ranks him eighth on the Trojans'  career passing yardage list.  </P> <P> Johnson, however, has a response for that.  </P> <P> "I know that every quarterback would want to play for a team that has one of  the best defenses in the country," Johnson says. "If the quarterback is  talented at all, he's going to do well.  </P> <P> "It's not too hard to figure out. When the other team is always getting three  downs and a punt, you're going to get a lot of chances as a quarterback. There  are so many opportunities for the offense to be a success -- and they've  surrounded Todd with good offensive players."  </P> <P> Point, counterpoint. Same as it ever was.  </P> <P> Cunerty, the Saddleback College quarterback coach who has known both Johnson  and Marinovich since they were 8, wishes the two could find common ground  beyond the football field.  </P> <P> "Everything, and everyone, seems to be polarized around them," Cunerty says.  "If you like Bret, you have to hate Todd. If you like Todd, you have to hate  Bret.  </P> <P> "I try to tell people to look at it another way. We're blessed to have two  players of their stature come from this area."  </P> <P> He has tried to sell the same line of thinking to Johnson and Marinovich.  </P> <P> "They are no longer just South Orange County kids," Cunerty says. "Now, they  are national role models. I'd love to see them become really good friends.  </P> <P> "I've seen this situation so many times in my 21 years of coaching. You have  these intense rivals on the field and they automatically think, 'I have to hate  him to beat him.' I don't think that has to be the way.  </P> <P> "As they continue to grow, they may develop a mutual respect for each other. If  so, I think both of them will benefit. If you approach it that way, there are  no losers."  </P> <P> Cunerty admits he isn't holding his breath.  </P> <P> "Bosom buddies, I don't think that will ever happen," he says with a laugh.  "They'll probably never shoot hoops together. . .. " "I enjoy being around both  kids and I've always wanted to get them together. But they're not too crazy  about it."  </P> <P> For now, annual meetings at the Coliseum and the Rose Bowl will have to  suffice. The first of a possible four commences today.  </P> <P> "And maybe five years from now, they'll get drafted by the Raiders and the  Rams," Cunerty says. "And after that, there'll be a Legends football league and  they'll join that. We could have this go on for 50 years."  </P> <P> Perhaps by then, they'll stop shaking fists long enough to shake hands.  </P></p>

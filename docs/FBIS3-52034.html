			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Text] A terrorist attack which caused a blackout in a  large part of Guatemala and diverse acts of violence contributed  this Thursday to create a climate of unrest in the country.  This has occurred on the eve of a public workers strike, which  according to the strike promoters, will be joined by over  200,000 workers. The uncertainty heightened in the wake of the  decision by the Transportation Coordinating Board to paralyze  activities this coming Tuesday. This measure could leave the  country without a normal fuel supply during the strike.    The explosion that we mentioned earlier injured three  persons  who were identified as: Lydia Bolanos, 32; Carlos Bolanos, 35;  and Ramon Hernandez, 32. Mrs. Bolanos is employed by the  computer section of the National Police and happened to be  passing by the area. The shrapnel scattered up to a radius of  5 km, reaching the Kennedy and Galilea neighborhoods of Zone 18.  [sentence as heard]    There were reports of other bomb explosions in the outlying  part of the city, in Panorama neighborhood in the city of San  Cristobal.    [Begin recording] [Volunteer firefighter Aguirre] Thus far  we  have received reports of three bomb blasts that occurred in Las  Ilusiones neighborhood in Zone 18 where the electricity towers  were damaged. Also, it was reported that another electricity  tower was damaged on the Pacific highway at the 22-km marker.  Our units were dispatched to the area and are searching for  possible casualties. Also, we received a report of another bomb  explosion in Panorama in the city of San Cristobal.    [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Aguirre, can you tell us if  these  bombs have caused any casualties?    [Aguirre] Yes, we learned that three persons injured in  Ilusiones neighborhood were taken to the general hospital in  Zone 6 for emergency treatment.    [Reporter] How badly were they injured?

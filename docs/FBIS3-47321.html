This year, President Clinton will again be faced with  difficult domestic and foreign affairs issues in steering the  government. We hope that in foreign affairs, he will be able to  take the initiative in working for world peace and security.    In his speech on national radio on New Year's Day, President  Clinton pledged further efforts toward the revival of the U.S.  economy. He also promised the realization of "employment,  health, and personal security." This means enhancing the  people's security by improving employment, implementing medical  insurance reform, strengthening peace and order, and anti-crime  measures.    On 3 January, a meeting of cabinet members concerned with  medical insurance reform was held, an indication of Clinton's  stance of exerting utmost efforts to deal with domestic issues.    The President might have come out with an attitude of giving  priority to domestic problems at this early time of the year in  anticipation of the by-election in November this year. If he  succeeds in domestic reform, the Democratic Party would have an  edge in the by-election, and this will also be a favorable  factor for his reelection as president two years later.    Certain factors may also work in President Clinton's favor.  The U.S. economy is on the track of recovery. Real annual  growth rate for the October-December 1993 period was 4 to 5  percent, and unemployment rate improved to 6.4 percent. Real  growth rate for 1994 is forecast to be 3 percent, and  unemployment estimated at 6 percent. Clinton is confident of an  economic recovery.    Since the Clinton administration attaches importance to the  restructuring of the U.S. economy, he is also expected to pursue  economic diplomacy in 1994. He will probably ask for further  opening of the market in the countries of the Asia and Pacific  region, which is considered the economic growth center of the  world. Improvement of Japan-U.S. economic relations in this  region, in particular, will be necessary.    The Hosokawa administration is fighting an uphill battle to  implement reforms in the Japanese political and economic  structures. While the Clinton administration pins great hope on  the Hosokawa administration, such reform requires considerable  time. It would not be wise for the United States to undermine  Japan-U.S. relations in its impatience to see results in the  economic issues.    The improvement of Japan-U.S. economic relations is not only  important for Japan, but will also be important for the United  States to enable it to play a more active role in the complex  international issues in the post-cold war era. Cooperation  between Japan and the United States, which account for 40  percent of world GNP, will be indispensable. The two countries  also have a responsibility in revitalizing the stagnant world  economy.    On the other hand, there had been a number of blunders in  Clinton diplomacy in 1993. The United States was not able to  take the initiative in dealing with regional conflicts in  Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti. Some believe this was due to the  incompetence of the three major foreign policymakers, the  presidential assistant for national security affairs, the  secretary of state, and the secretary of defense.    President Clinton replaced his deputy secretary of state,  and  accepted the resignation of Secretary of Defense Les Aspin in  December. He has started to reorganize his foreign and security  policies. Clinton diplomacy will take off during the NATO  summit meeting starting from 10 January, and the visit to Russia  after that.    It will be impermissible for the United States to take an  inward- looking attitude amid the chaotic international  situation. We hope the United States will succeed in realizing  change to strengthen its diplomatic position, and exercise  leadership in promoting international cooperation to settle  regional conflicts and resolve other issues.</p>

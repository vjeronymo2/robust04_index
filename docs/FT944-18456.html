			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Nigeria increases prices sharply Food, fuel and transport prices rose sharply in Nigeria over the weekend, stoking inflation already running at more than 100 per cent a year, Reuter reports from Lagos. The increases took most people by surprise as, breaking with past practice, the military government gave no warning or the customary explanations that it had to slash subsidies on fuel. Past increases have triggered protests and strikes in Nigeria, which is a leading oil producer and has domestic prices that are among the world's lowest. By yesterday there was still no official announcement that prices had been raised. A spokeswoman for state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation said: 'We have no official statement on the matter.' She declined to comment further, saying that no senior officials were available. The price of a litre of petrol rocketed more than four times to 15 naira (43p) from 3.25 naira on Sunday. The price of diesel rose to 14 naira from 3.0 naira and kerosene, the poor man's fuel, went up to 12 naira from 2.75. Analysts said the government might be keeping silent because it was testing people's reaction, having taken over the leadership of the unions that were most likely to have fought the rise. General Sani Abacha, the military ruler, sacked leaders of the oil workers unions and the labour federation in August to end two months of strikes and protests demanding the restoration of democracy. Gen Abacha also appears to have broken the political opposition, many of whose leaders are in detention. 'The last time fuel prices were increased the government was brought down,' said a western diplomat. 'It is by no means certain that the same will happen now.' 'Today, the trade unions are under the jackboots and can't react, at least not immediately,' said a senior executive of an independent oil marketing company. Fares in different parts of the country have shot up by as much as 200 per cent as transport operators pass the increased fuel charges on to commuters. 'I charged passengers 700 naira from Gboko (central Nigeria) to Lagos yesterday. Today, I am asking for 2,000,' Mr Bala Alli, an intercity taxi driver, said. Food costs have also risen, pushing up an inflation rate already running well above 100 per cent each year. 'How are people to survive under these circumstances?' asked a housewife at Ketu market near Lagos after paying 50 naira for a tuber of yam which on Friday cost 30 naira. Market traders said prices had been raised to cover increased transport costs. Nigeria, with a per capita income of less than Pounds 210, is one of the poorest nations in the world despite its big crude oil production. The country has been in turmoil since a previous military government annulled presidential elections last year believed to have been won by Mr Moshood Abiola, a business tycoon. Mr Abiola is in detention awaiting trail for proclaiming himself president in defiance of the military.</p>

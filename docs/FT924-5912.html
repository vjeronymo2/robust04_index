			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / International Company News: Carlsberg registers 5% improvement CARLSBERG, the Danish brewer, yesterday announced a rise of 5 per cent to DKr1.36m (Dollars 219.4m) in pre-tax profits for the year to September 1992. The result was achieved despite exchange losses and reduced customer spending in many main markets. Overall group turnover improved marginally to DKr14.95bn from DKr14,46bn the previous year. Beer sales fell slightly to 21.3m hectolitres. Carlsberg said the overall UK market had shrunk and uncertainty about the proposed merger with Allied Lyons had not provided the best stimulus. The group was uncertain whether it could achieve the same comparatively high level of earnings in 1992-1993.</p>

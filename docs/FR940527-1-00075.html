			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. FY 1995 Outlier Thresholds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For FY 1994, the day outlier threshold is the geometric mean length of stay for each DRG plus the lesser of 23 days or 3.0 standard deviations. The marginal cost factor (or the percent of Medicare's average per diem payment paid for each outlier day) for day outliers is equal to 55 percent in FY 1994. The cost outlier threshold is the greater of 2.0 times the prospective payment rate for the DRG or $36,000 ($33,000 for hospitals that have not yet entered the prospective payment system for inpatient capital-related costs). The marginal cost factor (or the percent of costs paid after costs for the case exceed the threshold) for cost outliers is 75 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For FY 1995, we propose to set the day outlier threshold at the geometric mean length of stay for each DRG plus the lesser of 22 days or 3.0 standard deviations. Section 13501(c)(3) of Public Law 103&hyph;66 provides that the additional payments for outlier cases may be different than the hospital's marginal cost of care during the transition period phasing out payments to day outliers. We are proposing to revise &sect;412.80 to reflect this provision. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also propose to revise &sect;412.82(c), so that it does not specify a marginal cost factor of 55 percent. HCFA will specify the level of the marginal cost factor during the day outlier phase-out in the annual prospective payment system rulemaking process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our proposed policy would reduce the proportion of outlier payments paid to day outliers as required by section 1886(d)(5)(A) of the Act. We are proposing to accomplish the required reduction in payments to day outliers for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FY 1995 solely through a reduction in the marginal cost factor rather than through an increase in the threshold. To determine the marginal cost factor necessary to achieve the mandated reduction in outlier payments, we simulated both the current and proposed outlier policies. Based on these simulations, we determined that a reduction in the marginal cost factor to 49 percent is necessary to achieve the required 25 percent reduction in the proportion of payments paid under the day outlier methodology. Therefore, we are proposing to reduce the marginal cost factor from 55 percent in FY 1994 to 49 percent in FY 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are also proposing a fixed loss cost outlier threshold in FY 1995 equal to the prospective payment rate for the DRG plus $23,300 ($21,400 for hospitals that have not yet entered the prospective payment system for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capital-related costs). The fixed loss threshold would replace the current threshold, which is equal to the greater of 2.0 multiplied by the DRG payment for the case or $36,000. We are proposing the fixed loss threshold under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the requirements of section 1886(d)(5)(A) of the Act. We believe the fixed loss threshold is an improvement over current policy because it focuses Medicare's outlier payments on the most costly cases. Under current policy, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is possible that cases in certain high-weight DRGs can incur losses significantly greater than $36,000 before Medicare will make an outlier payment. (We note that the fixed loss threshold is adjusted by the wage index, similar to the current cost outlier threshold. Thus, hospitals that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paid based on a wage index value of less than 1.0 will have this threshold reduced while other hospitals will be paid based on a higher threshold.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To further focus Medicare's cost outlier payments on the costliest cases, we are proposing to increase the marginal cost factor from 75 percent to 80 percent. We note that raising the marginal cost factor to 80 percent is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with a recommendation made by ProPAC in its March 1, 1994 annual report. While we are raising the marginal cost factor for cost outlier cases to 80 percent, we are continuing to set the cost and day outlier thresholds in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to maintain the estimated 5.1 percent proportion of total DRG payments paid as outliers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The thresholds we would propose if we were not implementing the change in the day and cost outlier payment methodology required by section 1886(d)(5)(A)(v) of the Act and discussed above would be:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Day outliers_The geometric mean length of stay for each DRG plus the lesser of 21 days or 3 standard deviations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Cost outliers_The greater of 2.0 times the prospective payment rate for the DRG or $31,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We estimate that the proposed FY 1995 outlier thresholds would result in 76 percent of outlier cases paid using the cost outlier methodology and 24 percent paid using the day outlier methodology. Cases that meet the day outlier threshold but that would be paid using the cost outlier methodology, because it yields the higher payment, would represent 20 percent of all outlier cases. Our simulation of FY 1995 outlier payments based on FY 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MedPAR data indicates that the percentage of outlier cases that would qualify as day outliers is approximately 67 percent. The cases qualifying as day outliers would receive 69 percent of operating outlier payments in FY 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An estimated 33 percent of outlier cases would be cost-only outlier cases, which would receive about 31 percent of operating outlier payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

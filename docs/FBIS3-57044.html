Representative of Pennzoil told TURAN's reporter that the  extra agreement enlarges and specifies the previous agreement,  signed in October of the year 1992.    The sides agreed to sign an extra agreement, as the previous  agreement envisaged only the shipment of equipment totalling 90  million dollars. As soon as Pennzoil began working here a  number of problems appeared -- the pipe plant, barge-pipelayer,  and auxiliary ships cannot be used for laying an undersea  pipeline as they are in emergency condition and need serious  repair. Then Azerbaijani side asked to increased the power of  compressors from 3 up to 4.3 million cubic meters per day, carry  out mounting-construction works and to train Azeri personnel.  The volume of expenses increased and reached more then 100  million dollars.    According to the extra agreement the SOCAR may pay for the  project differently: in hard currency, oil and oil products,  and on the account of Pennzoil's bonus share in the project of  exploration of "Azeri " and "Chirag" oil fields.    "The agreement states that the payment will be the most  acceptable for Azerbaijan, SOCAR's representative told TURAN's  reporter.    Representative of Pennzoil company said, that the work over  the project is to end soon, as it is ready for 90 percent by now.    The SOCAR counts that the shipment of gas to the shore will  start in the second quarter of 1994. A construction of a big  compressor station at "Neft Dashlari" oil field is nearly to  end, the laying of the pipeline is planned for late March.

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Leading Article: Bosnia - no easy options THE OUTRAGE provoked by atrocities against the Moslem population of Bosnia has brought worldwide calls for international military intervention. Democratic governments must take account of public opinion, but they must also avoid letting moral outrage outweigh their judgment of what is in the national and international interest. It remains the case that the west has no solution to this Balkan conflagration. The easy part is to define a moral position. It is not acceptable that one legally established state should seize the territory of another, although there are grey areas in the complexities of post-Yugoslavian politics. It is absolutely unacceptable that people be driven from their homes or massacred by a state in pursuit of such expansion. For the west to have stood aside, as some advocated, would have morally diminished it, while running the incalculable political risk of apparently sanctioning such behaviour elsewhere. Perhaps there was a moment, early in the conflict, when western military action would have made a decisive difference, but few were prepared to argue so at the time; President Bush and Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali both thought it was a problem for the EC to deal with. The EC made many mistakes. Single strategy Essentially, though, the west has pursued a single strategy: to intervene in a humanitarian way and to apply pressure through negotiations. The aid measures have been hesitant, but cumulative. Their success has been greater than many forecast. Negotiations, most recently for the Vance-Owen plan, have been frustrating and sometimes subverted by differences among the western allies which have simultaneously generated hope of intervention among the Moslems and confidence among Serbs and Croats that nothing effective would emerge from the UN. Against this background, the international community has clung to its objectives: to lay the foundations for a permanent settlement and to maintain the unity of the western alliance and the post-cold war consensus within the UN. It is not clear how the military options under consideration will support these objectives. All governments have ruled out the massive despatch of ground troops, for the good reason that this could lead to a Vietnam-type involvement, eventually intolerable to public opinion. A selective lifting of the UN arms embargo for the Moslems appeals to those who want to do more without becoming directly involved. Such a step would, however, prolong the conflict and could well require the suspension of the aid effort, as fighting intensified. The UN's position would then be untenable, weakening its influence in the Balkans and beyond. The third option - selective air strikes - also has serious flaws, given the mountain terrain, where arms can easily be concealed. Sooner or later, today's frustrations would be resumed, unless air raids were followed by the use of ground troops. Safe havens With the Vance-Owen peace plan in ruins, where does that leave the international community? A tougher regime of international sanctions, which takes effect today, does not feel like a sufficient response, yet the west would do well to learn from its mistakes. The most persistent of these has been its own lack of unity, something which the Clinton administration needs to bear powerfully in mind as it prepares to launch its policy initiative. Military gestures designed to improve the rating of American and European politicians with their domestic electorates should be avoided. Instead, the west should continue to build upon the two strands of action which have proved sustainable and, at least to a degree, effective. Economic sanctions should be intensified, and extended to Croatia, which has been shown again in recent days to be complicit in redrawing the map of the region by force. UN forces should meanwhile continue to focus upon channeling essential supplies, while their political masters urgently define a wider policy of safe havens behind lines which UN forces may well have to defend. Western airmen and soldiers may yet join this Balkan war. They should not do so until the political aims of their so doing have been defined.</p>

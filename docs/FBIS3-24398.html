			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Daniil Proektor: "Legacy of the Cold War and </F> Security Policy"]    [Text] "Renouncing cold war thinking means  recognizing that `big wars' are contraindicated for the 20th  century. The postindustrial society has acquired not only the  potential for self-annihilation but also immunity to it. The  latter is being recognized far more slowly than the first."    We have, evidently, to reconcile ourselves to the thought  that political forecasts have rarely been successful in the  present century. No one foresaw the catastrophes of three world  wars and their consequences. It was not anticipated that the  second would uninterruptedly grow into a third, a 40-year war,  which was, hardly correctly, called cold: No fewer people  perished in it than in the two preceding ones.    Despite the atomic bombs, which were declared a superlative  guarantee of peace.    The end of the cold war has confused the ideas of security.  Bloc opposition is clear and simple: Here's the enemy, this is  where we are, and here is the "border of the two worlds," on  either side of which are troop armadas, which do not advance  against one another. And suddenly everything has changed.  Security has disintegrated into a mosaic of permanently changing  blurred conflicts and wars arising suddenly just about  everywhere. Within states and outside.    In order to determine a rational security policy in a  changed  world it would not be inappropriate to link our thoughts with a  recognition of the lessons of the cold war just ended. For the  present grows out of the recent past, and, indeed, the "dead  tugs at the living," however much we swear that this time  everything will be in the new style.    The distortion of history over many decades has always taken  its revenge on us, although this revenge has not always been  recognized. It is distressing to think that in the present  security policy also a repetition of the mistakes of the recent  past is possible and that it is possible under the conditions of  the present internal crises and upheavals arbitrarily or  nonarbitrarily to slid into some version of relapses into the  cold war--this barren historical failure.    The calamity of the cold war was the mythologization of the  policy of security based on the ideology permeating it. The West  and its institutions were held with us to be an absolute evil.  Stalin's rejection of the Marshall Plan and reforms caused by a  fear of limitation of his spheres of power and the penetration  of "alien ideology" was the H hour at which the lag behind West  Europe began. An emphatic start was made there on economic  reforms, with us--just as emphatically--on a search for internal  enemies and the struggle against "cosmopolitanism."    Ideology began to stifle economics, and with it, to  undermine  security. Together with the failure of the Berlin blockade this  led to our isolation from the developed countries, which was  made worse by another failure--the war that was unleashed in  Korea.    These two losses of Stalin's in the cold war would hardly  have been possible had our elite not believed its own myths of a  decisive weakening of imperialism in the course of the "third  stage of its general crisis" and had it renounced overreaching  ambitions and the overestimation of the successes and victories  of socialism.    When, subsequently, Khrushchev--a reformer and liberal at  heart, but a hostage of the System--dragged the country  simultaneously into most dangerous crises at different ends of  the earth--the Caribbean, second Berlin, and Vietnamese--the  reasons were, generally, the same. As were the results.    We may observe with disquiet how currently increasingly  influential forces are once again attempting to insert  ideologization and myths in the constructive policy of security  of recent years. Responsible persons and leaders of parties are  declaring the "harmfulness and danger of the orientation toward  the West," which is hampering relations with the Arab world. As  though the one excluded the other. The calls for once again  counterposing "East" to "West" on the basis of some messianism  are becoming ever louder and militant slogans from extremist  circles similar to the rhetoric of the period 1910-1930's and  the 1950's, which led to two world wars and an intensification  of the cold war, are increasingly assured. An overestimation by  some party leaders of the powers of their country and people and  attempts to "embolden" them by prospects are noticeable once  again.    I am sure that a principal postulate of our security policy  should be a truth cast up by the cold war: Do not allow our  country to become isolated from the civilized world. This means  primarily treasuring the trust of others, who will in response  value our trust also.    Stalin's policy in East Europe and Korea on the frontier of  the 1940's-1950's and, later, the Berlin crises and the tanks in  East Berlin, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia undermined trust in us,  which we are sensing even today in the East European countries'  insuperable attraction to the West. The chauvinism and  xenophobia periodically artificially stoked in the years of the  cold war are now spreading like burning lava over increasingly  wide expanses, threatening the breakup of a great country and a  further loss of general trust in it.    The lesson of the cold war is the need to overcome the  mentality of the cold war. This is, perhaps, more difficult in  some respects than tearing down the Berlin Wall: People's memory  of the past is far stronger. Suspicion and remembered insults  remain for a long time in the subconscious of all too many  people. Converting this into policy is very easy when the world  is indistinct and unstable.    The mentality of the cold war was stimulated with us by the  demands of the system: to blindfold the consciousness of a poor  society from a sight of the West, which was rapidly pulling  ahead and becoming richer. But the movement of the world itself  relentlessly broke down the mentality of the totalitarian  system--the more fully this world of the era of the information  revolution converged, the more widely it opened up to all. Our  tragedy of the era of the cold war was the discrepancy between  evaluations of the surrounding world and its actual character.  The merit of the new policy, on the other hand, in the sphere of  security included, is the aspiration to reveal to the country  and the people the world such as it is. And to build relations  with it on such a basis, not on the previous one, whose  architecture was erected over seven decades.    Is the fate of Russian history of the past two centuries:  the  constant replacement of liberal reformers by those who either  slow down the pace or cancel out both the reforms and  liberalism, so inexorable? Are we condemned now to converge with  the West, now, having taken fright at this proximity, to enter  into confrontation with it? As in the cold war?    There are two hopes. The first is that we will succeed in  making the reforms irreversible, having determined, finally,  their true path. The second is that the surrounding world will,  perhaps, pull everyone into the information-technotronic  revolution to such an extent that the main crisis of the 20th  century--between rapid scientific and technological development  and the vestiges of the old social thinking in vast areas of the  world--will be overcome.    Then genuinely collective security will ensue. For its roots  lie not in this declaration and document or the other but in  people's mentality and consciousness, in general trust.    But can trust be stable if we have not determined the  priorities of our security policy and, in some respects, policy  in general? All had been determined, seemingly: to have good  relations with everyone wherever possible, with a particular  orientation toward the West, as all of Russian tradition has  indicated since the times of Peter the Great.    But suddenly, under the influence of some domestic  conservative pressures, the command: "left face-about face," is  being heard, just about. And it turns out that this orientation  is not the West in general but entirely the other way about--the  Asia-Pacific region. Or the Arab world. Or somewhere else. But a  great power is not an infantry company, and grand national  long-term strategy should not be called in question under the  pressure of the opportunist ambitions of this party grouping or  personality or the other.    Nor can there be uncertainty in respect to the Partnership  for Peace slogan.    One has the feeling that under the shock impression of the  results of the last elections a certain reconsideration of the  estimates of external threats and of security policy in general  is planned. It was acknowledged quite recently at the highest  level that, broadly speaking, we have no enemies. The idea of  general security "from Vancouver to Vladivostok" was recognized.  There was talk of an alliance with NATO. We were at one with the  majority at the United Nations and in the CSCE, we were thinking  of joining the European Union, and we had established good  relations with the United States.    And now, evidently, as a consequence of the events of 12  December, we are hearing increasingly sharp criticism of this  effective policy of security on the part of authoritative  people. It transpires that the establishment of relations with  the United States is an "infantile disorder" or the legacy of  Brezhnevite diplomacy. For the first time since the times of the  height of the cold war we have heard threats to start World War  III uttered by us! Sharply worded demands for the naming of a  "specific enemy" since the "military doctrine of the Soviet  Union considered the probable enemy the developed capitalist  countries, primarily the United States," and this was good and  useful, are being heard. And so forth.    But if there is no enemy? Should we invent one in order to  "educate" the soldiers more easily?    But we have been over this hundreds of times already and  have  acknowledged on thousands of occasions that the world has  changed and that the dangers and threats are not those of the  cold war but entirely different ones. And the concerns for our  security have shifted toward the southern Russian borders and  the sphere of national, ethnic conflicts. But why, then,  resuscitate nostalgia for the vanished monsters of the cold war?  After all, wars arise not on account of the existence of weapons  but as a result of policy. You can have many missiles and live  in peace, and you can have a minimum number and begin to throw  them.    The difficult subject of attitudes toward NATO is connected  with this also. It is understandable that 40 years of hostility  cultivated their stereotypes, which it is difficult for many  people to abandon immediately. If we are expecting a  deterioration in our relations with the West under the impact of  our internal processes, certain steps are then understandable.  Fears that NATO could draw closer to our borders in connection  with the likely membership of the alliance of the former Warsaw  Pact countries and our Western neighbors included.    But if we intend to progress further along the path of the  creation of a general system of security in the spirit of the  ideas of the end of the 1980's-start of the 1990's, what is  there to fear? It is hard to find serious arguments against the  Partnership for Peace and the subsequent convergence of the  security systems of East and West in some interacting structure,  which could not happen any time soon, for that matter.    We do not need new Berlin walls at the borders. They would  be  disastrous for us. We need integration in the world. Inside and  outside. And unified security systems could contribute to this.  Inside, in the form of a common security space in the CIS,  outside, in consistent movement toward what was long since  called general European and, subsequently, a global system of  security. Even if only in the next century.    A return, however, to bloc thinking would have deplorable  consequences. After all, cold war blocs are a complex  phenomenon. Defense against external attack is just one of their  functions, not even, I would venture to say, the most important.  The internal, "deterrent" functions are considerably more  important. For the United States after the war this meant  control and "reeducation" of German and Japanese extremism, the  cementing of "Atlantic peace," and a strengthening of West  Europe's relations with North America. For the elite of the  USSR, control over the socialist camp and its unity and  retention of East Europe in the orbit of the totalitarian  structure and its protection against the impact of an alien  system.    But the question of questions is the correlation between  security and the internal condition of society. Involvement in  the most dangerous crises of the cold war era was a consequence  of internal factors to a greater extent, probably, than external  factors.    In the West the fear of the ruling elites of appearing  "weak"  in the face of communism and losing the electorate and  exaggerated fears in the face of the "world communist threat"  stimulated the United States to war in Vietnam and an invasion  of Cuba.    In the East fears of internal ferment in the Warsaw Pact  countries, dissidence, and the undermining of the socialist camp  prompted a series of crises--from Berlin to Hungary and  Czechoslovakia and to fraternal assistance to 49 countries of  the "anti-imperialist world" with the writing off of the debts  of the majority of them at a time of the enormous crisis of its  own economy. Here we have the roots of the present troubles.    What has been called the "logic of the cold war"--the  incitement of hatred, furious distrust, and a mythical belief  that the sole salvation lies in the stockpiling of weapons in  the guise of a "balance of forces"--has taken shape as a result.    The main threat to the security of our people lies in the  all-embracing crisis of society--the legacy of the policy of the  cold war. If crime has become an internal war against the  people, if corruption is demolishing morals and the system of  government, if separatism is threatening to disarticulate a  unified great country, if all this is the case, where are the  keys to national security to be found? In a quarrel with the  West and NATO, which are extending the hand of assistance and  friendliness, or in the restoration of order within?    Our security is being totally undermined by internal  processes, the sources of which lie not so much in this mistake  or the other of the politicians of recent years (of which, as we  know, there have been enough) as in the entire preceding era  after 1945. And if we once again look for enemies across the  ocean and in Europe or Asia and not under our own nose, we will  be making even more grievous mistakes than those with which the  cold war was filled.    This by no means signifies, God forbid, a call for us to  forget about possible external threats. The bloody wars along a  wide arc from Yugoslavia to the Caucasus and Central Asia, like  also unforeseen changes in the overall situation, require  reliable defenses--who can fail to understand this?    But it is a question of a sober evaluation of realities, the  correlation of forces, and dangers and possibilities.    To abandon the thinking of the cold war means to recognize  that "big wars" are contraindicated for the 20th century. The  postindustrial society has acquired not only the potential of  self-annihilation but also immunity to it. The latter is  recognized far more slowly than the first.    "The atom bomb is a paper tiger," Mao said. Doctrines of  "nuclear deterrence" are still in vogue at this time. But there  have been more than 300 wars in the atomic era, and the bomb has  not deterred them. After the Caribbean crisis, many people  realized that no one would use it. But certain countries' race  for "nuclear status" is once again in fashion today. The hopes  of certain leaders that the bomb could be a splendid means of  policy and an attribute of respect, and of certain military  figures, that this would be an excellent instrument of war and  victory, are incurable, evidently, like the most virulent  pathogenic bacteria, like relics of the cold war.    And the final point. Concerning the dimensions of a policy  of  security within the framework of Russia's relations with its  neighbors. The concepts of "spheres of influence" and "national  interests beyond one's borders" are highly contradictory. They  disturb no one if democracy and accord constitute their  foundation. They are unacceptable if totalitarianism and  imperialism are mixed in here.    The difficulty of this problem for Russia reflects the  consequences of the disintegration of the Union. The  impossibility of severing economic ties overnight. Millions of  Russians who have been left abroad. The tremendous number of  troops, a legacy of the cold war, who need to be removed, but  whither we do not know. The need for Russia's peacekeeping in  the conflict zones and for soldiers to guard what are now  foreign borders. The strategic positions of the Black Sea  region. And, finally, the specters, summoned from the darkness  by conservative forces, of the consequences of the  Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which have not been forgotten in East  Europe and which are once again pushing it as far away from  Russia as possible.    It is clear that it will take great political skill in  unentangling this knot of problems wound tight by the cold war  not to overstep the fragile bounds separating that which is  inevitable and necessary from imperial pretentiousness. The  first would be understood. The second would to our and general  shame be rejected.    In all this lies the problem of problems. The 20th century  is  an unbroken unprecedented general crisis, a global transitional  era on the way to some new future world, possibly. Only in this  context is it possible to think about security.    It cannot be ruled out that if the new generation of  politicians simply disregards the lessons of the past cold war,  it could pull the world into the semblance of a new one. Its  possible outlines are not clear as yet. Whether there would be a  series of some small cold wars or, God forbid, a new, albeit  brief, NATO-Russia or Russia-rest of the developed world split.  Both would be an intensification of our tragedy.    Yet there is hope: Good sense and a recognition of the  experience of the catastrophic 20th century will halt the flight  to nowhere. The world will inevitably come together and unite,  which will help overcome cold wars and make security more stable.</p>

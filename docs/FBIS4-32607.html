			<p>BFN     [Text] Zvornik, June 27 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslem forces  have continued attacks on Bosnian Serb positions, further  violating the one-month ceasefire that took effect on June 10,  Bosnian Serb Army sources told TANJUG on Monday [27 June]. They  said the heaviest Moslem attacks in the past 24 hours were in  the areas of Doboj, Mt. Ozren in northern Bosnia and Mt. Vlasic  in the central part of that former Yugoslav republic.    Early on Monday, Moslems opened artillery fire on Doboj, a  strategically important Serb town in the Bosna River valley,  with sporadic mortar shellings of Serb positions in the areas of  Trebava, Mt. Ozren, Teslic and Gradacac around Doboj. Moslems  also continued attacks on Serb positions and settlements near  the Serb town of Brcko on the Sava River.    Moslems are still launching infantry attacks on Serb  settlements of Ilidza, Nedzarici and Ilijas in the Sarajevo  area, Bosnian Serb Army sources said. Bosnian Croats violated  the ceasefire in the area of the Croat enclave of Orasje in  northern Bosnia, where combined Bosnian Croat and Croatian Army  troops are firing at Serb positions from small arms as well as  anti-aircraft guns and mortars.    Croats also renewed attacks in the area between Dubrovnik  and  the Serb town of Trebinje in the Dubrovnik hinterland in  southern Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

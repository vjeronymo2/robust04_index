			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD PARK;  </P> <P> ITSALLGREEKTOME ECLIPSES FIELD IN THE TURF CUP  </P> <P> Itsallgreektome's fifth stakes victory of the year, in Sunday's $500,000  Hollywood Turf Cup, could lead to another big prize in the near future.  </P> <P> The 3-year-old gelding's one-length victory in a 14-horse Grade I race enhanced  his chances of winning the Eclipse Award as the nation's top turf performer.  </P> <P> Nobody can question his credentials. He was first, second or third in nine  consecutive stakes, lost by a neck to Royal Academy in the Breeders' Cup Mile,  then raced 1 1/2 miles for the first time Sunday.  </P> <P> "(An Eclipse) would be nice," said trainer Wallace Dollase, still beaming after  his biggest success.  </P> <P> "It would be the cream. He's beaten some awfully good horses, he's gone 1 1/2  miles and went a brilliant mile. Who else can say they've done that?  </P> <P> "I think he's got to be right there. And this is an iron horse. You've got to  call him an iron horse to run as often (12 times this year) and consistently as  he has. I've got to find something to knock on because he's also been able to  remain 100% sound. I give this animal a lot of credit. No doubt about it, he's  something special."  </P> <P> Ridden perfectly by Corey Nakatani, Dollase's son-in-law, Itsallgreektome saved  ground early after breaking from the rail, was taken to the outside down the  backstretch, began to rally around the final turn, led by a length with a  furlong to run and finished in 2:24 4/5, breaking the Turf Cup record of 2:25  4/5 set by Alphabatim in 1986 and three-fifths off Rivlia's course record. He  paid $7 as the 5-2 favorite and earned $275,000 for his 83-year-old owner,  Jheri Redding.  </P> <P> "What a ride," Dollase said. "That's what I was worried about with all those  horses. With all those horses, how was this horse coming from out of it going  to be lucky enough to get through? Corey just moved him on the backside and was  sitting perfect then.  </P> <P> "This horse has a terrific three-eighths of a mile run in him. He has a lot of  patience and when you ask him, he goes. He gives you everything he's got.  Today, he just ran right on by them. It was a perfectly timed ride."  </P> <P> Nakatani hasn't done much wrong on the gray son of Sovereign Dancer, and at 20,  he has become a veteran in the world's strongest jockey colony. The Turf Cup  was his 20th victory of the meeting, placing him fourth in the Hollywood Park  standings.  </P> <P> "In the beginning, he was a little bit rank, but because he's such a nice horse  he came right back to me," Nakatani said. "Going down the backside, I just  wanted to get position and he relaxed just the way he always does. When I asked  him to pick it up, he just took off.  </P> <P> "There was never a question in my mind about the distance. I knew the horse was  fit and I knew there wasn't a horse in the race who could run with him. I think  he should get the Eclipse Award."  </P> <P> Mashkour, a 20-1 shot who had been beaten by a head while carrying a $125,000  claiming price in his last race at Oak Tree, came from far back to gain the  place, finishing two lengths ahead of 11-1 shot Live The Dream. A head back in  fourth was pacesetter Fly Till Dawn.  </P> <P> "I had to check pretty hard at the three-eighths pole, and if that hadn't  happened, it would have been a better horse race than it turned out to be,"  said Mashkour's rider, Chris McCarron. "He was coming out of some cheaper  races, but he's legitimate. He got beat by a head by Rial at Del Mar and that  horse came back to win some nice stakes. (Mashkour has) run some productive  races and he should have been closer today."  </P> <P> Although he won't be leaving Hollywood Park, Itsallgreektome will be taking a  vacation. The San Francisco Mile, March 23, at Golden Gate Fields probably will  be his 4-year-old debut.  </P> <P> Rial was fifth in the Turf Cup, then came Hodges Bay.  </P> <P> With six days remaining, Gary Jones is firmly entrenched atop the Hollywood  Park trainer standings. He has 13 winners from 41 starters, putting him three  ahead of Bill Spawr.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most encouraging development for Jones has been the emergence of  Tabaman.  </P> <P> A full brother to Turkoman, the 3-year-old didn't show a thing in his first two  starts -- finishing 11th and sixth -- improved in his third race, around two  turns, finishing 2 1/2 lengths behind in second. He went to the sidelines after  that March 4 race and didn't return until Nov. 11.  </P> <P> Since coming back, Tabaman has been a different animal. He blitzed maidens by  four lengths, then Saturday he defeated another highly regarded colt, High  Energy, by more than a length in a fast 1:21 2/5 for seven furlongs.  </P> <P> "He was too big and too soft (earlier this year)," Jones said. "He just needed  a lot of time. He's come back a different horse."  </P> <P> Chris McCarron, who has ridden Tabaman in three of his five starts, also  notices a huge difference.  </P> <P> "He's really matured a lot," he said. "He was something of a clown before. He  didn't really want to put out everything he had.  </P> <P> "The time has really helped him a lot. He's just the opposite of his brother  (whom McCarron also rode). He has a lot more speed and he's more aggressive.  You could blow a bomb up underneath Turkoman and it wouldn't have fazed him.  (Tabaman has) really come around nicely."  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Laffit Pincay Jr. won for the first time since returning from a broken  collarbone when he took the fifth race on favored Secret Meeting, but he had to  survive a stewards' inquiry. . . . Chris McCarron had two victories Sunday,  running his total for the meeting to 48 and putting him 14 ahead of runner-up  Alex Solis. . . . Festin ran the fastest 1 1/16 miles of the meeting when he  won the seventh in 1:41 4/5 as the 4-5 favorite. . . . Timebank, another  talented 3-year-old trained by Gary Jones, will be sidelined for a couple of  months. He was second to Frost Free in the Vernon O. Underwood Nov. 24 in his  last start. Jones also said Quiet American probably will make his 1991 debut in  the San Pasqual Handicap, Feb. 3, at Santa Anita.  </P></p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Pizza Hut heads for New Delhi middle classes / A look at the latest entrant to be permitted to join the Indian fast-food market First it was burgers, then fried chicken, and now pizzas, as the Indian government continues to attract international fast-food companies to the country's newly-liberalised markets. Pizza Hut International, a subsidiary of the US food and drink conglomerate PepsiCo, has been given permission to establish a 100 per cent-owned company in India, which will set up a chain of pizza restaurants with an investment of some Dollars 40m spread over seven years. The approval follows the clearance in November of a similar Dollars 40m proposal from Kentucky Fried Chicken, another PepsiCo subsidiary, to extend the world's largest chicken restaurant system of 9,000 restaurants in 68 countries to India. Earlier last year, McDonald's, the world's largest fast-food chain, received permission to set up shop in India. Meanwhile, Burger King, the second-largest fast food chain in the US, has been exploring, the Indian market, but has yet to finalise its plans for India, which may include a local partner. The American fast-food giants, which have successfully expanded their chains of outlets to new markets in China and Russia, are confident that India, with its burgeoning middle class, provides excellent potential for the food industry. A detailed feasibility study by Burger King has illustrated that India is a more suitable market for fast foods than China. This explains PepsiCo's decision to make New Delhi the venue of its largest restaurant yet - a 600-seater flagship store that will house both Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken under one roof. The company says the decision to combine the chicken and pizza outlets is the result of market research, which showed that Indians preferred a variety of foods to be served in a restaurant, and that single-fare outlets would not do well in the Indian market, where large families eating out prefer multi-cuisine restaurants. This is best illustrated by Nirula's, a Delhi-based fast food chain which offers a range of foods and cuisines, from burgers and pizza to kebabs and curries. Nirula's has contributed substantially to introducing middle-class Indians to western-style 'junk' foods. The family-owned company would rather not disclose its turnover, but an indication of its size is that it serves over 40,000 customers each day through its 11 outlets in Delhi, and has three busy restaurants in Nepal and one in Muscat. Nirula's has held its ground to competition from foreign entrants such as Wimpy's, the UK chain, which enter-ed India through a local Indian partner several years ago, but has had difficulty break-ing into the market. 'The Indian market is extremely tempting but there are very real problems here, and the foreign chains have no idea what the odds against them are,' says a successful Indian restaurateur. One hurdle for foreign chains is the unavailability of some western ingredients, and religious taboos on others. McDonald's and Burger King earn a large chunk of their revenue from beef and pork burgers, which would not find favour with Indian clients, who prefer goat or lamb if they eat meat. Kentucky Fried is not too happy about the quality of chicken and fat for frying in the local market. And Pizza Hut will have to set up its own factory for a steady supply of Mozarella cheese. Indian wheat is too soft for pizza bases, and so hard wheat will have to be grown or imported. And specialised kitchen equipment will also be subject to government licensing. 'Our main problem is to set up a supply chain for pizza toppings, chicken, fat and wheat,' said a PepsiCo executive. Both subsidiaries will need until at least September to launch their chains.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Fuzhou, April 18 (XINHUA) -- East China's Fujian  Province has designated its priorities for economic development  this year.    The major tasks were discussed at a recent economic  symposium  attended by Hong Kong, Macao and overseas Chinese entrepreneurs,  as well as local government officials.    They put forward the following tasks:    -- The further improvement of the current open pattern of  this coastal province to promote local development. The  construction of the economic zone at the mouth of the Minjiang  River, and the petroleum, chemicals, iron and steel and power  industries, and the port at Meizhou Bay will be speeded up. The  economy in the mountainous area will be promoted with the  building of Wuyishan Airport and railway construction.    -- Infrastructure construction will be accelerated to  improve  the investment environment. The province's planned investment  in infrastructure is 26.2 billion (about three billion U.S.  dollars), 20.4 percent higher than last year. Some 30 key  infrastructure projects have been designated by the province, 21  of which are in the transport and power sectors.    -- Approval procedures for foreign investors will be  streamlined. Crucial problems concerning major projects will be  coordinated by the provincial government. Laws and regulations  concerning foreign- funded projects will be strengthened.    -- Foreign investment will be oriented mainly toward ports,  the power industry, airports, highways, agriculture and the  technical upgrading of old enterprises.    -- Foreign-funded firms will be helped in their operations,  especially in the fields of marketing, raw materials, labor and  energy supply.    -- Efforts will be made to maintain a stable influx of  foreign funds.    Wang Jianshuang, deputy governor of Fujian, told the  symposium that the province would provide more convenient  conditions for overseas investors.</p>

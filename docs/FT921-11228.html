			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Property: There is life beyond Chiantishire / A look at the current state of the Italian housing market YOU CAN buy a house in Italy for Pounds 7,000 although, admittedly, it needs a little patching-up - like needing a roof. Or you can find splendid villas costing millions of pounds, with a wide choice in between. Yet Italy's housing market does not receive much publicity in the UK, where agents handling it have become even fewer in the past couple of years. It tends to have spells in the spotlight, as when the Aga Khan's involvement in the Costa Smeralda development brought gossip-column names thronging to Sardinia. More recently, the focus has been on Tuscany and the British couples busy restoring old farmhouses in 'Chiantishire' (although, with rising prices, that interest has waned. Perhaps, though, it now is time for a ramble around today's Italian offerings. Going up the scale from those roofless 'opportunities' (try Brian A. French, tel: 0423-865 892, if you must have one) there is much else for restoration, although it is not necessarily cheap - you are told to accept that the Italian market is still buoyant, even if people are a little ambitious in their asking prices. For instance, there is a Tuscany property - without electricity and to which 'water is at present brought by tanker' - for Pounds 147,000. True, this is a farmhouse with three barns and 80 acres. Another property ('not quite falling to bits but needs work done on it soon') is Pounds 163,000. There is no piped water or electricity but again, to be fair, it has 15 acres and is 50 minutes from Florence. Possible buyers who fight shy of anything 'campable once a bathroom is installed,' or 'with convertible pigsty at rear,' might find more appealing a refurbished country house in the Chianti region, boasting vineyards and olives, swimming pool and guest cottage. With drawing room, dining room, library and two en-suite bedrooms, the asking price is Pounds 565,000. For the professional developer, perhaps, is a site below the walls of the Etruscan city of Volterra, south-west of Florence. It is an hour from the sea and Pisa airport. There is permission for a 40-bedroom hotel, restaurant, swimming pool, tennis courts and eight self-contained apartments. Offers: about Pounds 434,000. The same professional (but surely no one else) might be interested in a 70-room former convent in four acres near Siena. The rooms are being renovated to create 14 apartments and more than Pounds 1m is sought for the reconstructed shell. A hillside hamlet of farm buildings with 180 acres, in the Chianti region, has permission to become a holiday development with swimming pool. Work has started on 13 apartments. This property is registered as a company and, if bought as such, a loan of Pounds 500,000 is available at 1 per cent. A neighbouring farm pays Pounds 8,000 a year for the produce of a vineyard which is part of the land. Price: Pounds 1,195,000. On a private estate in the same area, 18 detached houses are being restored. Each will have its own pool and prices range from Pounds 304,000 to Pounds 434,000. It is intended to organise the group as a condominium, with an annual charge to cover maintenance and security. These properties and projects are available through Babet (tel: 0460-762-123). If all else fails, the agency can offer a quaint, end-of-row cottage which needs work, 20 minutes from the sea in north Tuscany. Stone-built, with outside steps and wrought ironwork leading to the upper floor, it has a terrace and cellar. Price: about Pounds 11,000. So, what of Sardinia's Costa Smeralda estate today? Re-sales come up from time to time. Peter Fea, of Costa Smeralda Holidays in London, says the average price of villas there 15 years ago was Pounds 80,000. Now, it is Pounds 400,000 upwards. Ten came on the market last year and he knows of two that are available now. One comes with about 100 yards of coastline (these days, you cannot build within about 200 yards of the sea). It has a living room on several levels with terraces, dining area, five en-suite bedrooms, an office with fax and telex, courtyard with patio and fountain, and guest cottage. There is also a swimming pool in the grounds and steps down to a natural harbour. Price: Pounds 2.5m. The other villa has a British owner - Tim Rootes, bloodstock breeder cousin of the late (second) Lord Rootes. He had the property built in the hills back from the coastline but looking towards Corsica. There is a drawing room and terrace, dining area and an outside summer dining area. Two of the three bedrooms have en-suite bathrooms. There are guest and staff cottages and a swimming pool in the 15-acre grounds, while a berth and garage at the marina go with the property. Price: around Pounds 1m. Details of these villas from Costa Smeralda Holidays (tel: 071-493 8303). The Woolwich building society, as Woolwich Spa, has an office in Milan and lends through 500 branches of 15 banks, aiming at Italian first-time buyers. In a recent survey, it noted that Italy was the most expensive of the EC countries in which to rent or buy property. A Confederation of British Industry report last year put the average rent of an unfurnished three-bedroom flat with central heating, in a good area of Italy, at Pounds 1,500 to Pounds 1,800 a month. The average purchase price of a detached house with three/four bedrooms and modern conveniences, in a similar area, was Pounds 600,000.</p>

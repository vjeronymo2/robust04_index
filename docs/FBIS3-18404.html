			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] During a visit to the Rivolto air base, in  Friuli, Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri spoke about the shooting  down of the Serb planes and diplomatic reactions to the  incident, especially from Russia. Tino Zava reports.    [Tino Zava, voice over video] NATO is not a rusty machine --  on the contrary, it is an organization capable of acting with  great timeliness and efficiency. According to Defense Minister  Fabio Fabbri, this is demonstrated by what happened in Bosnia  yesterday, where NATO and the United Nations had much of their  credibility at stake. He said that the incident at Banja Luka  was sad but inevitable. [passage omitted]    Is there any possibility of reprisals against Italy, where  the U.S. F-16's set out from? Fabbri promised that we would  monitor the situation closely.    [Fabbri] The protective shield created by NATO is able to  warn us of any movement from that territory that might  constitute a threat against our territory.    [Zava] Fabbri praised Russia's stance over the Banja Luka  incident, and then spoke about Italy's new defense plan. There  will be more fighter planes rather than missiles.</p>

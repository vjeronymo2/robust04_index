			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis bid the  Zapatist National Liberation Army, EZLN, delegates, especially  Subcommander Marcos, goodbye in Ocosingo, Chiapas very early  this morning. Camacho Solis reiterated his conformation with the  commitments reached in the Zapatists' presence. The first phase  of the peace and reconciliation talks in Chiapas resulted in 34  commitments. We will later describe the commitments reached, as  well as the EZLN demands and Commissioner Manuel Camacho's  responses during almost 10 days of this first phase.    Peace has not been signed in Chiapas. The Zapatists are  returning to their communities to report on the agreements  reached. The commissioner, the Zapatists, and mediator Samuel  Ruiz will meet again, probably by the end of this month,  although the date has still not been set. After Camacho Solis  departed, the EZLN delegates, accompanied by International Red  Cross representatives, returned to their communities to explain  the agreements. I repeat, they will return to San Cristobal de  las Casa before the month is over.</p>

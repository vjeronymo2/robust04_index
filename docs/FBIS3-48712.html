Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says:    For the South Korean puppets to talk about "changes" is a  futile attempt to keep off the ever increasing influence of the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea with their short tongues.    Changes are needed not in the North but in the South.    In the South there must be a change in such a manner as  making the society independent after putting an end to the  colonial enslavement policy and the flunkeyist and treacherous  policy, as democratizing the society after liquidating the  "civilian" fascist system and as checking the moves of  confrontation and division and heading for national unity and  reunification. [sentence as received]    The worldwide trend of change oriented to independence and  democracy must reach South Korea. But the puppets are crying  for "changes" in the North, ignoring this trend. This reveals  their sinister intention to stifle our socialist system by  bringing the "wave of liberalization" to the North.    The puppets blared that they would "actively promote the  reunion of separated families." This was nothing but a  hypocritical act to veil their anti-reunification nature,  fooling the fellow countrymen's desire of reunification with the  humanitarian issue.    If they have the least intention to lessen the sufferings of  those families, they should, first of all, have stated that they  would send POWs Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan to their home towns so  that they might spend their remaining years with their kinsmen.    The fellow countrymen who are making a vigorous march  towards  reunification in the '90s will never tolerate the Kim Yong-sam  group's treacherous acts seeking only confrontation and division  against the trend of the time.</p>

			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney shares fall after threat of closure Euro Disney, the struggling leisure group, yesterday saw its shares fall sharply after Mr Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, its US parent company, confirmed that the EuroDisneyland theme park may close unless Euro Disney is recapitalised. The shares have been volatile since November when Euro Disney announced an unexpectedly heavy net loss of FFr5.3bn (Dollars 900m) for the year to September 30. They closed yesterday at FFr30.40, down from FFr33.00 on Thursday. Mr Eisner said in an interview with Le Point, the French weekly current affairs magazine, that the park's closure would be a possibility if Euro Disney failed to reach agreement with its creditor banks for an emergency restructuring of its FFr20.3bn net debt. 'If we can reach a reasonable agreement . . . then Euro Disney will continue, that would be a happy ending in the Disney tradition,' he said. 'Otherwise we'll have a much more difficult ending. If the engine of an aeroplane breaks down in mid-flight, what are your options? At the moment anything is possible, including closure.' The Disney chairman was ambivalent about the prospects for the negotiations. 'Some days I think we'll pull it off, other days not,' he said. 'There are more than 50 banks involved in this affair and it's difficult to predict what such a big group will do.' Mr Eisner was repeating earlier warnings from Disney executives to the creditor banks that EuroDisneyland could close if the restructuring talks fail. Euro Disney is expected to run out of cash imminently and its parent has promised financial support until the March 31 deadline for the end of restructuring negotiations. Analysts dismissed yesterday's share price fall as nervousness among investors. 'All it does is underline the fragility of this stock,' said one. However, the pressure on Euro Disney's shares could pose a problem for the company's hopes of securing the restructuring, given that Disney envisages including a rights issue in the rescue package. Further falls in Euro Disney's shares would reduce the prospective proceeds of a rights issue. Disney, which hopes the final package will halve Euro Disney's debt to FFr10bn, would then face the task of persuading the banks to convert more of their debt into equity or of persuading new shareholders to invest in its stricken European subsidiary.</p>

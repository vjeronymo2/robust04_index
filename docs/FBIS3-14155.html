			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Major General Amnon Shahaq, deputy chief of staff  and head of the Israeli delegation to the talks with the PLO in  Cairo, has said that the sides have not reached agreement even  on one of the issues on the agenda. There is a gap in the  positions of the sides, and the discussions will continue today,  he asserted.    Replying to a question by our correspondent in Cairo Arye  Gus, Maj. Gen. Shahaq said the atmosphere in the talks was  normal. He added that the operation against terrorists in  Hebron yesterday had nothing to do with the ongoing talks with  the PLO. It is a terrorist event, and we will fight terror  wherever it is uncovered, he stated.    Our correspondent has learned that the discussions are  currently centered on the number of foreign observers to be  deployed in Hebron, the size of the future police force, and who  will command it. Israel opposes the Palestinian demand to set  up a force of no less than 1,000 [as heard] troops. Our  correspondent adds that Israel will apparently not object to  having the international observers carry guns for self-defense.</p>

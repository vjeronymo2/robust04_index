Information has it that the Beijing government has adopted  some special measures to deal with dissidents, worried that a  democratic movement could emerge again on the 15th anniversary  of the Beijing Xidan Democracy Wall movement and the fifth  anniversary of the 4 June Incident this year. In view of the  fact that the "two sessions" was in progress and a large number  of foreign reporters had gathered in Beijing covering events,  the departments concerned were asked to act more cautiously when  carrying out their mission, but they were still given the go  ahead to take strong action against pro-democracy activists in  case the latter "refused to take advice."    It is said that concern about Deng Xiaoping's health is  another factor causing the CPC higher leadership to keep a high  vigilance against any moves by dissidents in Mainland China.</p>

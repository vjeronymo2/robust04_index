			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Lottery spending rules laid down Money raised for good causes from the National Lottery should be spent mainly on capital projects, Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, said yesterday. Mr Brooke said this would ensure that lasting new and improved facilities would be created by lottery profits which analysts believe could reach Pounds 1bn a year. The national heritage secretary was setting out a framework for distributing funds raised by the lottery. Five 'good causes' - the arts, charities, a millennium fund, the national heritage and sport - will receive equal amounts. The distributing organisations are the Arts Council, the Sports Council, the National Heritage Memorial Fund, the Millennium Commission and the National Lotteries Charity Board. Mr Brooke said that with the exception of the charity board, the distributors would be asked to concentrate on capital projects to create 'first-rate facilities for sport and the arts and for investing in our built and natural heritage'. The distributors will be asked to give priority to projects that have an element of 'partnership funding'. All projects, Mr Brooke said, must be considered on their individual merits and all type and size of organisations should be able to apply. Eight consortia have made bids for the licence to run the National Lottery and the winner is expected to be announced in May. Ticket sales should begin either late this year or early next. Meanwhile, the BBC seems to be ahead in the television lottery stakes. The corporation believes that a majority - and possibly as many as six  - of the bidders may have specified it as their preferred lottery broadcasting partner. Detailed broadcasting negotiations will only begin after a winner is chosen. ITV is so concerned that this week Mr Andrew Quinn, chief executive of the ITV Association, went to the Independent Television Commission to discuss what ITV believes are restrictive rules on broadcasting the lottery. The ITC has made it clear that ITV can broadcast a lottery programme but insists there can be 'no undue prominence' for what is a commercial product. The BBC does not appear to be so constrained and has been pitching hard for the right to carry the big draw, which could carry a top prize of up to Pounds 5m each week.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Valeriy Yakov report: "Staffers of the `Vympel' Group Are </F> Together Again"]    [Text] The process of the transfer to the Ministry of  Internal Affairs of the facilities, the hardware, the armament,  and what little remained of the personnel of the former "Vympel"  special group has been completed (IZVESTIYA has written of this  twice recently -- Nos. 34 and 41). The unusual subunit has  ceased to exist in its former capacity, and its staffers have  ended up under various "roofs." So as not to lose the ties, the  mutual understanding built up over the years, and the mutual  assistance, the group's officers have decided to reunite.    The initiative has come mainly from those who have retired  and who are filling out their pension documents. They have  proposed setting up the Fund for the Social Protection of  "Vympel" Group Staffers and inviting to participate in the fund  all who have ever served in this subunit. The idea has been  supported by many "Vympel" staffers, including those who have  gone to serve in other structures. The founding document has  been registered in accordance with the procedure laid down, and  a search is now being conducted for premises to house the  headquarters. On learning of the fund's creation, some firms  and organizations at once started offering their services --  with premises and transport. But the "Vympel" staffers are in  no hurry to make their choice.    Nor are they as yet entirely clear about their future  commercial activity. Everyone realizes right from the start  that it will be necessary to earn money, and nobody in the fund  entertains any illusions that some sponsor will give selfless  assistance. One small thing is lacking -- a decision on how  they can earn money.    The special group's former staffers intend initially to  provide consultative services to respectable commercial  organizations and state structures, suggesting how best to guard  themselves against industrial and economic espionage and  terrorist activity. They will also be able to indicate  vulnerable points in the already developed systems of security  measures of any firms and organizations and to make  recommendations on methods for checking out future partners,  including foreign ones.    The group's former staffers intend to use the funds earned  to  support the families of their comrades who died in Afghanistan,  for those injured while fulfilling various assignments, and for  all "Vympel" veterans who need assistance.    The creation of the fund has hardly been publicized  anywhere,  but this idea has created obvious alarm and displeasure in  certain high offices. And this, I believe, is perfectly  explicable -- all the conditions for the breakup of the group  were not brought about merely so that its staffers might once  again come together in a single team which would no longer be  subordinate to anyone and would live according to its own  regulations.</p>

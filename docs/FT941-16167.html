			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Clinton in Europe: Clinton camp sees its man as winner / Assessing the results of the US president's maiden voyage in Europe Before the Nato conclave was even half over, Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, declared: 'This has been President Clinton's summit.' This is natural, and not only for US officials. All heads of government put their distinctive stamps on summits, be they economic, military or regional. Mr John Major's aides in Brussels were spinning his contributions for all they were worth, at least in the hope of getting decent play on the front pages back home. Yet there seems to be a sense of satisfaction on the US side that Mr Bill Clinton has performed as well as they believe he has on his maiden presidential voyage to Europe, given all the heavily publicised anxieties supposedly greeting him. Three highlights, in their mind, stand out: first, the Sunday speech in which Mr Clinton emphasised in the strongest terms US moral and practical support for a Europe integrated economically, politically and militarily was exclusively directed at his European audience and apparently well received. Second, the Ukrainian nuclear agreement has been generally interpreted as a 'foreign policy triumph', of which Mr Clinton's first year saw too few. It means he will not leave the former Soviet Union empty-handed, regardless of what difficulties there are in his talks with President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow, although officials in Kiev yesterday cautioned that its ratification by parliament was no foregone conclusion. Third, US officials really do believe that Mr Clinton dominated the Nato summit itself, both in his exposition of the Partnership for Peace programme of co-operation with eastern Europe, though this was a pre-cooked agreement, and in avoiding a transatlantic rift over Bosnian policy. On this, at least, there was independent verification. Mr Manfred Worner, the Nato secretary general, with whom Mr Clinton seens to have struck up a good relationship, said yesterday that 'everybody was impressed by the strong leadership and personal conviction of the US president'. But a lot of this back-slapping - the Americans call it log-rolling - is to be expected, since members of the club tend not to knife each other in public. Of greater interest is what may be said off-the-record, particularly by those on the European side previously unfamiliar with Mr Clinton. Senior Brussels officials were clearly impressed with Mr Clinton's energy, intelligence and grasp of detail. The sense of a new generation of leadership came across during a news conference at the European Commission yesterday, in which the US president's fluency contrasted with a visibly shaky Mr Andreas Papandreou, prime minister of Greece, which holds the EU presidency, and an occasionally wordy Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president. 'Clinton really can talk about the 21st century, these other people simply won't be around,' said one observer. The US president also appears to have charmed the French, perhaps at the expense of ignoring the British. His Monday tete-a-tete with President Francois Mitterrand and Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, included an improbable compliment about France's 'constructive co-operation' in concluding a Gatt world trade agreement. More substantively, the US decision to give explicit political recognition to an independent Europe-only defence capability operating under the Nato umbrella signifies a strategic shift. In contrast with the Bush administration, Mr Clinton appears much more relaxed about allowing the West European Union to take on greater burdens such as peacekeeping. German and French officials said the US move marked a big step toward a credible 'European pillar' in Nato and a recognition of the potential in the Maastricht treaty's provisions for a common European foreign and security policy. There are three question marks. First, US efforts to redistribute the burden of defence in Europe could easily be misinterpreted as disengagement. Second, a distinct European 'defence identity' will amount to nothing if the Europeans themselves cannot muster the political will to act, as the divisions over the wisdom of future action in Bosnia once again showed this week. Third, and more broadly, it is unclear what the administration's call for greater political, economic and military integration in Europe, including Russia, means in practice. Mr Clinton spurned the chance, for example, of creating parallel tracks for the east Europeans to enter Nato and the EU. In fairness, Mr Clinton forestalled some objections by spelling out a commitment to maintain 100,000 troops in Europecomed by the British and Germans. Moreover, his reluctance to set out blueprints for European integration matches the mood of uncertainty among Europeans themselves after ratification of the Maastricht treaty.</p>

Titcomb, (Chief, Acquisition and Assistance Division), (202) 208&hyph;6431.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department published an agency-specific preamble as part of the final nonprocurement debarment and suspension common rule on May 26, 1988 (53 FR 19159), which indicated that, due to the expanded scope of transactions covered under the rule, coverage of its nonprocurement debarment and suspension system was limited to transactions included in section 12.110(a)(1) of its proposed rule (52 FR 39042).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department also indicated that a review of the Department's other nonprocurement program activities would be made to determine whether such activities would be included in the coverage. The review was made; however, plans to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking to obtain public comment on covered transactions on or before October 1, 1988, were dropped.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Issues of concern to the Department were addressed through the subcommittee of the Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension which reviewed the scope of the nonprocurement debarment system. Although the revision of the common rule being proposed does not address the issue of scope, the Department is proposing to include the results of the resolution of this issue as part of the publication of this proposed revision as discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New exceptions for certain types of transactions under natural resource management programs are being proposed. These exceptions would make clear that permits, licenses, exchanges and other acquisitions of real property, rights-of-way, and easements, under natural resource management programs would be excluded from coverage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, when the Federal Government seeks to acquire real property, including through use of an exchange of real property elsewhere, the transaction will not be subject to these regulations. In such cases, where the success of the agency program depends on a specific parcel of land, the application of the debarment and suspension system could harm the public interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, public land management activities require the use of certain transactions for land and resource management without regard to the identity of the recipient. Accordingly, range management transactions, such as grazing permits and rights-of-way, are excluded by the proposed exception language. Similarly, virtually all recreation management and public land access transactions are not covered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Department is proposing to amend section 12.110(a)(3) of its final rule to include nonprocurement debarment system coverage for Federal acquisition of a leasehold interest or any other interest in real property, concession contracts, and disposition of Federal real and personal property and natural resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The scope of the Department's nonprocurement debarment system will include transactions associated with natural resources management programs and the disposition of natural resources with the following exceptions: permits, licenses, exchanges and other acquisitions of real property, rights-of-way, easements, mineral patent claims administered by the Bureau of Land Management and water service contracts and repayment contracts awarded by the Bureau of Reclamation. Patents issued under the Mining Law of 1872, 30 U.S.C. 22 et seq., as amended are statutory entitlements and, therefore, are exempt under the terms of Executive Order 12549. The award of water service contracts and repayment contracts is mandatory, provided by the Reclamation Project Act of 1939, as amended, set forth at 43 U.S.C. 485.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Department proposes to exclude all transactions concerning permits, licenses, exchanges and other acquisitions of real property, rights-of-way, easements, mineral patent claims, water service contracts, and repayment contracts from its nonprocurement debarment and suspension system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A corresponding change is also being proposed in Section 12.200(c) to add a reference to these excluded transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 43 CFR Part 12  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedures, Cooperative agreements, Grants administration, Grant programs, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is proposed that title 43, part 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations be amended as follows.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: December 8, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Bonnie R.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Subhash Kirpekar: "India Rebuts Pak Charges"] </F>   [Text] Geneva, March 5. India, in its first right of reply  at the United Nations Human Rights Commission session here, said  that the statement made by the leader of the Pakistani  delegation, Mr. Iqbal Akhund regarding the self-determination of  the Kashmiri people is "neither justified nor factual."    The former foreign secretary and envoy, Mr. T.N. Kaul, who  exercised the right to reply said that Mr. Akhund's statement  more closely reflected the "condition of people living in  Pakistan occupied Kashmir and the northern territories where  free and fair elections have not been held so far, where  fundamental freedoms are suppressed ruthlessly."    "Even inside Pakistan, atrocities committed by Pakistani  army  and security forces in Sindh, Baluchistan, and the Frontier  Provinces are well known," he said while objecting to Pakistan  internationalising bilateral problems thereby making a solution  more difficult.    Referring to the Shimla agreement signed when he was foreign  secretary, Mr. Kaul said that what Pakistan was doing for the  last four years was a blatant violation of this pact. It had set  up training bases in PoK [Pakistan Occupied Kashmir] and in  Pakistan itself for militants armed and financed and guided to  commit acts of sabotage, subversion, loot and arson in both  Punjab and J and K. "They have failed in Punjab and are failing  in Jammu and Kashmir also. Hence, their attempt to  internationalise the issue," he added.    Stating that he was born and brought up in Kashmir, unlike  Mr. Iqbal Akhund, and some who did not even speak the Kashmiri  language but claimed to be Kashmiris, Mr. Kaul rejected the  accusation that "India's terrorism in Kashmir was supported by  draconian laws."    "When misguided youths and local insurgents are aided,  abetted instigated by a neighbouring country to commit loot,  arson, rape and murder and drive at the point of the gun,  minorities and even Muslims who do not agree with them, from  their hearths and homes, no government worth its salt can shirk  its duty to protect the people against such acts," Mr. Kaul  replied.    Till the end of 1993, over 11,000 Kalashnikovs, 700 machine  guns, 600 rocket launchers, 15,000 hand grenades besides  wireless sets, rockets and a lot of ammunition and explosives  had been captured, all supplied by the Pakistan ISI  [Inter-Services Intelligence] to the insurgents, he said. A  recently captured foreign mercenary admitted to having raped 85  women, all Muslims, as there were hardly any non-Muslim women  left in the valley.    Ms. Karen Parker of the International Educational  Development, an NGO, demanded that, the promised plebiscite in  Kashmir be conducted now so that the 40-year old UN resolution  could be implemented. "The occupying power responds with the  barrel of the gun, 600,000 strong, aimed at the Kashmiri people.  Is this what the Commission means by democratic process?" she  asked. The Kashmiris may not have oil, unlike Kuwait, but they  had a passionate yearning for their promised plebiscite, she  said.    The NGOs from Pakistan who spoke on the subject were Dr.  (Ms.) Attiya Inayatullah of the World Muslim Congress and Mr.  Syed Nazir Gilani of the World Society of Victimology. Mr.  Gilani said that "while armed separatists were said to be  responsible for kidnapping and killing government officials as  well as members of the paramilitary forces and civilians,  serious concerns had also been expressed over a large number of  killings by the Indian security forces. Victims of torture  included policemen, he said. The UN had procrastinated in its  will and India had frustrated every opportunity to investigate  the breach of these violations, he said.    Dr. Inayatullah, who has created some controversy because of  her being chairman of the executive board of UNESCO as well as  adopting the role of an NGO, relied on statistics provided by  the All Parties Hurriyet Conference to depict the human rights  situation in the Valley and called Dr. Farooq Abdullah a  "quisling".    In an oral intervention by International Pen, the world  association of writers representing members in 87 countries, Ms.  F. Assaad said that Pen did not condemn anti-terrorist  legislation per se and indeed recognised that legal  measures were by far the most effective instrument in the  struggle against violent insurgency. However, it was concerned  that such legislation often including clauses which could lead  to violations of the rights of those not advocating violence. In  India, TADA [Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Prevention Act]  contained clauses which penalised the right of freedom of  expression. It stated that such acts included views through  speech or any other media.</p>

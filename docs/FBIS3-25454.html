			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Representatives of the MPLA [Popular Movement for  the Liberation of Angola] and UNITA [National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola] in Lusaka have agreed on a formula  for pursuing national reconciliation. They have signed a  document which dictates the spirit of peace, forgive and forget  the past, and an amnesty for all who committed crimes during the  civil war. The document also guarantees a role for UNITA in a  future Angolan administration. Carolyn Dempster called up  UNITA's chief negotiator in Lusaka, Jorge Valentim. She asked  him how significant this new agreement is:    [Begin recording] [Valentim] Indeed, this subject of  national  reconciliation is very difficult and very complex, but we  succeeded to adopt the general principle because there is a  political willingness on the two sides, and also we must be very  thankful to the mediation, to the observers who helped us to put  down important principles that can reconcile, (?really), Angola.    [Dempster] How soon are we likely to see the implementation  of some of these principles?    [Valentim] The two sides accept that the reconciliation is  not a matter between institutions, it is a matter between  Angolans to work together for common goals with the spirit of  cooperation. Also it is important that we accepted that all  violence should be condemned, every conflict should be solved  peacefully, and also the two sides accept that the UNITA  elements should participate fully in all levels of  administration, political institutions, economic and other  institutions.    [Dempster] Mr. Valentim, (?a lot of) people looking at this  would say, but what right does UNITA have to participate in a  future government in Angola? After all you lost the democratic  elections and the war that was waged was very much taken up by  your leader, Jonas Savimbi.    [Valentim] Yes, I want to say that we are the Angolans, we  learn from history, from civil war in the United States, from  other wars, that the most important is political willingness,  and we are ready to finish the war. The voice that we will  listen will be the voice of Angolans, they want (?really) the  Angolans to live together. That is why we are ready to  cooperate, to build up a new nation.    [Dempster] Mr. Valentim, this sounds like very noble  statements, but at the same time as you are making them and  reaching some kind of agreement across the table on  reconciliation the fighting is continuing, and if anything,  intensifying. Now, what hope is there of reaching a point of a  cease-fire in the near future?    [Valentim] We are insisting every day to the mediation and  observers to do everything possible to appeal to the two sides  to stop the war in order that we should have real good  environment, political environment for discussions. The two  delegations, they don't agree to escalate the war in Angola, and  the relationship between the two delegations is excellent. I  want to say it clearly that we hope, with appeal of the Security  Council and with the appeal made by President Clinton from the  White House, our leadership in Huambo and Luanda, they will  listen to the voice of reason in order to put down all this  escalation of war in order to have peace in Angola.    [Dempster] So, you are saying that the political discussion  has to be finished before there is a cease-fire, or you are  hoping that there will be a cease-fire before you in fact finish  negotiations?    [Valentim] Well, if it was my wish, it is really now to have  de facto cease-fire before finishing all the political debate,  no matter that it was agreed before in December that a formal  cease- fire should only be declared after we finish all issues.  But the personal willing of the UNITA delegation is that the  fighting now should be completely finished with a de facto  cease-fire on the two sides. [end recording]</p>

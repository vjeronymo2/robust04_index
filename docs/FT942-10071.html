			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Royal Bank Direct Line's dazzling growth obscures a less satisfactory aspect to the results of Royal Bank of Scotland. Its tier 1 capital ratio has fallen steadily from 7 per cent to 6.5 per cent over the past year. That is still perfectly comfortable. Yet it does raise the question of whether the bank can generate enough earnings to finance growth and pay the dividend increases the market expects. Royal's instinctive response is that excessive capital dilutes return. The truth could be a bit more complicated. Direct Line currently absorbs only Pounds 155m of Royal Bank's capital, which is small in relation to shareholders' funds of Pounds 1.95bn. But while it continues to grow so fast it will almost certainly need to plough back its earnings to maintain its solvency margin. Direct Line will take time to provide the group with distributable earnings. First-half growth elsewhere was heavily dependent on three factors: falling provisions which will not last indefinitely, mortgage lending where margins may come under pressure as competition develops, and acquisitions by its Citizens subsidiary in the US. This is not to deny the validity of Royal's strategy of diversification designed to reduce volatility in its earnings while putting them on a fast upward track. It is simply that its dividend is more constrained than might appear from last year's 25 per cent increase. Market disappointment with yesterday's statement that the full year's payment would be at least 12p - an increase of 9 per cent - is an indication that expectations were running away with themselves.</p>

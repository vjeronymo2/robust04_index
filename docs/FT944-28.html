			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Sport: Careers fall to drugs and money - War and Peace (Playing fields and battlefields) / It was the year of the World Cup and the Winter Olympics, the bung and the bribe. Peter Berlin reviews the events of 1994 Antics off the sports field often dominated the headlines in 1994. Tales of drugs and money were everywhere. More competitors were caught using drugs to put extra meat on their bones. More agents, officials and competitors were caught trying to take a larger cut from the fatted calf. In soccer, Marseilles finished second in the French first division and were relegated over a bribes scandal. In England, Bruce Grobbelaar, the Southampton goalkeeper, was accused of taking money to throw matches. The battle between Tottenham Hotspur and the Football Association over the club's list of controversial financial deals dragged on until December. Perhaps the FA should be grateful to the lawyers who persuaded them to reduce Tottenham's punishment to a Pounds 1.5m fine. As the Tottenham matter was being settled, George Graham, manager of Tottenham's north London rivals Arsenal, was accused of accepting Pounds 285,000 - allegedly paid back later, with interest, to Arsenal - from Rune Hauge, the agent of John Jensen, a Dane who Graham bought in 1992. Graham is not the only manager to have had dealings with Hauge. If every club suspected of strange transfer dealings or of quietly writing cheques to the Inland Revenue were relegated, Notts County would be in the Premier League. In the US, the baseball season ended abruptly and the National Hockey League season never started as the team owners fell out with players. The dispute is, ostensibly, over the players' willingness to accept the ever more enormous sums of money the owners offer them. The owners want to introduce salary caps, on the model of the National Basketball Association and National Football League. In the NBA, clubs are coming up with increasingly imaginative contracts. Even with a salary cap the owners of wealthy clubs cannot resist trying to pay as much as they can afford to star players. The early experiences of the NFL salary cap - most teams have got rid of highly-paid players, while the San Francisco 49ers have carried on signing one superstar after another - suggest that the more complex the rules, the greater the advantage of the best-run clubs. The 49ers have worked out the nuances of the cap quicker than their rivals and used it to rebuild their fading power. In soccer, bungs, backhanders and tax dodges are the product of the desire of the rich clubs to exploit their financial advantage and of less-wealthy clubs to keep up. They are also the natural coin of an industry which seems content to allow its managers to dip into the pot on their own behalf whenever they conduct financial transactions. Naturally, the soccer authorities find it convenient to blame outsiders  - the agents - and plan to issue licences. But clubs eager to sign a star will still talk to whoever the player chooses to represent him. The fact that an agent plays too rough for the FA or Uefa may only recommend him to a player keen to employ the toughest negotiator. The year brought a fresh crop of steroid busts, each followed by the usual protestations of innocence. In athletics, Britain leads the world in drug use. Six Britons tested positive in 1994, led by Diane Modahl, a popular and successful middle-distance runner. Perhaps more significant were the positive tests of 11 Chinese competitors, most of them swimmers, at the Asian games in Japan. These seemed to confirm western suspicions that the recent successes of Chinese women were the product of systematic drug use. Diego Maradona's expulsion from the World Cup, after he tested positive for five varieties of the stimulant ephedrine, drew mixed reactions. The British tabloids, who still bear a grudge for the Hand of God goal that knocked England out of the 1988 World Cup, were gleeful. In Argentina it was viewed as a disaster. Unlike steroids, stimulants must be taken just before competition and will always show up in drug tests. They are taken by idiots or by desperate men. For Maradona they were, briefly, the elixir of youth. They gave him nothing that he had not once possessed. For three games he recaptured some of his earlier brilliance. Soccer fans who drew pleasure from his reborn genius will have regarded his disgraced exit from world football with mixed feelings. Cocaine is just for idiots. Perhaps the only surprise about the affair of Paul Merson, the Arsenal footballer, is that it has taken so long for the drug to spread from north American sport. Even so, the Merson case had a peculiarly British twist. Merson said he snorted coke to keep himself going during lager drinking sessions. Merson was condemned by a host of pundits and ex-pros for setting a bad example to young fans with his drug taking. Of course, cocaine is illegal while lager is legal, but someone should tell children that drinking 14 pints of lager a night is also a bad idea. One of the most encouraging spectacles of the year was watching bemused middle-Americans being dragged round World Cup stadiums by children in soccer T-shirts. The experience of the US soccer authorities since then provides a healthy reminder that money has its limits. The USSF, in spite of its mountain of World Cup cash and goodwill, failed to launch the professional league it had promised Fifa. Even the biggest, gaudiest sporting blooms grow from the ground up. The US soccer authorities would be better advised to nurture instead the flourishing grassroots of soccer in their country and show a bit of patience. But patience was a quality in short supply in a year when so many in sport tried to take short cuts to success.</p>

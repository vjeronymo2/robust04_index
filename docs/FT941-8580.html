			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Conflicting inflation signals depress Dow Wall Street US share prices finished moderately lower after joining bonds on a rollercoaster ride powered by conflicting signals on inflation, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 14.63 down at 3,922.64, after see-sawing between a 19-point gain and a 30-point loss during the session. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 followed the blue chips, losing 2.45 at 470.34. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite slipped 0.86 to 474.46 and the Nasdaq composite shed 2.38 to 790.24. NYSE volume, at 340m shares, was heavy. The session began on a bright note. The Labor Department said its consumer price index was unchanged last month, and its core index, excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, showed a tame 0.1 per cent increase. Forecasts had centred around a 0.3 per cent rise for both figures. Furthermore, the Commerce Department said the US trade deficit narrowed in December largely because of increased exports. For stocks, the overall picture was the best of both worlds - low inflation and solid manufacturing growth. The bellwether blue chip Dow index shot up, aided by the Treasury market's favourable response to the CPI report. But bonds gave back most of their gains when the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's February business outlook survey suggested that prices paid by manufacturers in the region were on the rise. The downturn accelerated in the afternoon as investors perceived the leading nature of the Philadelphia price data as probable cause for a further tightening of interest rates by the Federal Reserve. In response the Dow took a nose-dive, dropping 32 points in as many minutes, before stabilising and climbing part of the way back late in the day. Caterpillar outperformed the market, adding Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 108 3/4 , while most blue chips showed weakness. 3M receded Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 108, General Motors Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 59 7/8 and IBM Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 52 3/4 . In defence-related issues, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas continued to benefit from the previous day's announcement of a Dollars 6bn aircraft order by Saudi Arabia. Boeing added Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 47 3/4 and McDonnell Douglas Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 119 7/8 . Raytheon fell Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 62 on news that the US army passed over a missile interceptor developed by the company. Loral, which won the contract, put on Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 41. In medical technology, US Surgical dropped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 18 5/8 after revealing that it was renegotiating loan agreements with its banks. On the Nasdaq, Lotus Development surged Dollars 6 1/2 to Dollars 66 1/2 on a report that the software concern may enter into a joint venture with AT&amp;T. Canada Morning gains in Toronto gave way to afternoon declines in response to a similar performance in New York. The TSE 300 index ended 16.8 off at 4,407.3 and falls led rises by 457 to 373 after volume of 83.4m shares valued at some CDollars 990m. Greyhound Lines of Canada jumped CDollars 3 1/4 to CDollars 22 3/4 . The company declared a special dividend of CDollars 5 a share.</p>

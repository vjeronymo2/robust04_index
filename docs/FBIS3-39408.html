			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Hadi Uluengin "The Aftermath of the Attack on </F> Zhalah Camp"]    [Excerpts] Either someone is lying or an effort is being  made to distort the facts. One does not need to be an  astrologer to realize this state of affairs. Studying the  official statements and the chronology of the developments will  be enough. [passage omitted]    The disclosure by the military officials after the air  attack  on the Zhalah Camp in northern Iraq, which has been described as  the most intensive air raid since the establishment of the  republic, said that the targets were completely destroyed and  the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] suffered many casualties.  However, the PKK, Democratic Party of Kurdistan, leader Mas'ud  Barzani and the Turkish journalists who visited the area have  disclosed that the PKK suffered few casualties.    It will be recalled that in the past General Dogan Gures,  chief of the General Staff, accused those who sought a  nonmilitary solution to the Kurdish problem of "making  nonsensical remarks while sipping whiskey in the Bosphorus."  This time, he has accused those who have questioned the air  operation of "lobbying for the bandits." He has done so when  even former President General Kenan Evren, who led the military  takeover of the administration on 12 September 1980, has  described the air attack as an unsuccessful operation. In view  of this, should he also be regarded as a member of the "lobby of  the bandits?"    Who is telling the truth about the attack on the Zhalah  Camp?    It will be recalled that Tehran lodged a protest over the  bombing of Iran's territory, noting that the bombs that were  dropped on Iran killed and wounded several people and caused  damage to property. The General Staff rejected Iran's protest.  However, the information the Turkish Consulate in Orumiyeh  conveyed to Turkey and the delegation Ankara sent to the region  confirms Tehran's claims. In fact, it will be recalled that a  government spokesman has disclosed that Turkey will compensate  Iran.    Considering all that, how can the discrepancy between the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Turkish Armed Forces be  explained? Which of the two state establishments is telling the  truth?    Sources affiliated with the General Staff have said that the  operation against the Zhalah Camp cost 12 billion Turkish lira.  However, Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin has said that  the operation cost 1 trillion Turkish lira. Which of the two  figures is accurate and who is telling the truth on that matter?  [passage omitted]    Civilians wish to learn from all the establishments,  including the military, who claim to be totally open, about who  is telling the truth about the attack on the Zhalah Camp. As  tax payers funding the budget of $32 billion, the citizens  demand a disclosure of the military spending in southeastern  Turkey, which total $6 billion. They wish to know how this  effects inflation rates.    Those who call for a nonmilitary solution to the Kurdish  problem want a civilian administration in Turkey. Their  question of "who is telling the truth" is not aimed at serving  the "lobby of bandits." On the contrary, they ask that question  because they want to preserve Turkey's national unity. They are  convinced that national unity can be maintained only through a  political and non-military solution to the Kurdish problem, a  solution that will establish peace and equality.</p>

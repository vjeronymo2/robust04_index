			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Board shuffle at BA as Lord King steps down  -Chairman denies departure connected to Virgin affair LORD KING stepped down yesterday as chairman of British Airways, six months ahead of schedule, in an attempt to bring to an end the continuing controversy over the airline's 'dirty tricks' campaign against Virgin Atlantic. Lord King, who angrily denied that his departure was connected to Virgin's recent High Court libel victory, said he was going early, after nearly 12 years as chairman, to 'remove uncertainty and speculation' about the future leadership of BA. He described his time at BA as 'the crowning achievement of my life'. Sir Colin Marshall, chief executive for 10 years, becomes executive chairman of the airline. Mr Robert Ayling, head of marketing and operations, takes up the new post of group managing director. Lord King's election as president of BA, for an initial three-year period, was accompanied by a decision to enlist one extra non-executive director - yet to be appointed - and to enhance the role of non-executive board members in monitoring the performance of executive directors. Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry, who until yesterday was joint deputy chairman with Sir Colin, becomes the sole deputy chairman, with responsibility for leading the non-executive directors and heading the monitoring process. Sir Colin said Sir Michael would be 'a sounding board for the executive and a focal point for the non-executives as well'. Sir Michael said Lord King had left behind him 'the strongest possible senior management team'. Together with the recent implementation of a code of conduct for all employees, to be overseen by a special committee of non-executive directors, the moves are intended to ensure that BA does not again make itself liable to Virgin-type allegations. It was also announced yesterday that Mr David Burnside, BA's director of corporate affairs, was leaving immediately. BA is hoping that the fall-out from the Virgin affair will now subside, though it is still in peace talks with Virgin, which will continue next week. Failure to agree new ground rules for competition between the two airlines could yet re-open the controversy. Sir Colin paid tribute to Lord King, with whom he had enjoyed 'a remarkably successful partnership'. He said his departure represented 'the end of an era' during which he had made an outstanding contribution to BA's conversion from a loss-making, state enterprise to one of the world's most profitable airlines. He added: 'It was his decision to go and it was a generous gesture. He took it to ensure the organisation is better able to settle down and does not have to endure continued speculation'.</p>

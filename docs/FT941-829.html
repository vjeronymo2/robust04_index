			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Poor nations seek closer co-operation with G7 Fifteen poor nations with large markets plan to seek better economic deals from industrialised nations at a three-day summit that begins today in New Delhi, reports AP. Police went on alert yesterday as heads of state of eight countries of the Group of 15 began arriving. The other countries are represented by government ministers or senior officials. About 7,000 policemen ringed many buildings in the city where the meetings will be held. Member countries from Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean will seek closer co-operation with the Group of Seven of the world's largest industrialised nations: the US, Canada, Italy, France, Germany, Japan and Britain. 'We collectively represent a GDP of Dollars 1,400bn. Our total trade turnover is Dollars 404bn,' Indian foreign minister Dinesh Singh told the meeting that was drafting a communique to be adopted at the end of the summit. The developing countries hope to have greater bargaining power with rich nations by pooling their natural and human resources. Apart from the host, India, presidents or prime ministers of Nigeria, Senegal, Zimbabwe, Argentina, Indonesia and Malaysia are taking part in the conference. Mexico, Chile, Peru, Venezuela, Algeria, Egypt, Brazil and Jamaica are sending representatives. Critics of the G-15 say that, during the five years since it was created, the organisation has lost much of its significance as many of the members prefer to line up with regional trading blocs. The preference for such arrangements is underscored by poor attendance at the meetings. Others, however, maintain that the group is still relevant. 'The industrialised countries will make poor nations do what they want. The only way out is for the less powerful countries to get together,' said AP Venkateswaran, a former external affairs secretary for India. The conference is unlikely to force richer countries to relax import quotas on merchandise such as textiles or to retain their subsidies on food exports to poor countries under the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Many poor nations say that, under GATT rules, they will have to pay royalties for products that used not to entail patents under intellectual property rights.</p>

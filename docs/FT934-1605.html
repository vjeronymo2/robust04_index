			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: Japanese insurers warn of claims rise Investment profits on assets at Japan's 25 non-life insurers fell 9.7 per cent in the six months to September to Y563.9bn (Dollars 5.27bn) from the same period a year earlier, Mr Takashi Onoda, chairman of the Marine and Fire Insurance Association of Japan, said, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Mr Onoda told a news conference that the lower yields were mainly due to falling interest rates. Net premiums of the 25 firms rose 3.1 per cent to Y4,790bn, while net insurance claims increased 2.9 per cent to Y1,670bn over the same period, he said. The association expects insurance claims to rise sharply in the second half of 1993-94 as heavy rains and typhoons this summer caused serious damage throughout Japan, Mr Onoda said. Japan's non-life insurance firms and the finance ministry are studying measures to cope with foreign insurers' demands to open the insurance market wider to newcomers, he added.</p>

			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> DRUG RAIDERS FIND ARSENAL IN RESIDENCE;  </P> <P> SIMI VALLEY: AUTHORITIES SEIZE 125 FIREARMS, 100 BLADED WEAPONS AND $750,000  WORTH OF COCAINE. THREE ARE ARRESTED.  </P> <P> An arsenal of knives, grenades and machine guns was described by law  enforcement authorities Monday as the largest collection of weaponry ever  seized during a drug raid in Ventura County.  </P> <P> Police said they found 125 firearms and 100 bladed weapons -- along with  $750,000 worth of cocaine -- in an upstairs bedroom when they stormed a Simi  Valley house on Sunday and arrested Gardner Ernest Flockhart, 31, a suspected  high-level cocaine dealer.  </P> <P> "This is incredible," said Sgt. Steve Bowman, supervisor of the Ventura Police  Department's narcotics division. "I haven't found any policeman who's seen this  many guns in one place at one time."  </P> <P> Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said it was the most extensive collection found  during a drug raid in the county.  </P> <P> The seizure culminated a six-month investigation by local law-enforcement  agencies into a ring suspected of distributing cocaine to residents of Ventura  and Los Angeles counties.  </P> <P> An investigation of Robert Dale Lloyd, 27, an alleged drug courier from  Ventura, led to Flockhart, who is believed to be his supplier, Bowman said.  </P> <P> On Sunday, Lloyd allegedly delivered one kilogram of cocaine to an undercover  officer in a parking lot in Simi Valley and was immediately arrested on  suspicion of sale of a controlled substance and possession for sale of a  controlled substance.  </P> <P> Police then served search warrants on Lloyd's Ventura auto-repair business and  his house on El Medio Street, where they found half an ounce of cocaine  packaged for sale and arrested his wife Sharon Lloyd, 32, on suspicion of  possession of a controlled substance for sale.  </P> <P> Police also raided Flockhart's house, where they found $50,000 worth of guns,  12 pounds of cocaine with an estimated street value of $750,000 and more than  $500,000 in cash -- including Krugerrands, silver ingots and antique coins,  authorities said.  </P> <P> "One room was a veritable arsenal and supermarket for cocaine dealing," Bowman  said.  </P> <P> When officers entered the residence, they found Flockhart in the upstairs  arsenal standing next to a hand grenade, Bowman said. Flockhart was arrested  without incident on suspicion of sale of a controlled substance, possession of  a controlled substance for sale and federal firearms violations.  </P> <P> Flockhart's girlfriend, Christine Lynn Helenick, 28, was arrested on suspicion  of possession of a controlled substance for sale. Brian Howard Mudge, 27, who  also lived in the house, was arrested on suspicion of possession of a  controlled substance for sale.  </P> <P> Robert Lloyd was being held in lieu of $20,000 bail in the Ventura County Jail,  a jail spokesman said. Sharon Lloyd, Helenick and Mudge have been released on  bail, police said. Flockhart remains in custody without bail.  </P> <P> Flockhart, who describes himself as an unemployed actor, was convicted of  possession of narcotics for sale in Los Angeles County in 1986.  </P> <P> As a convicted felon, it is illegal for Flockhart to possess any firearms,  Bowman said. If convicted in federal court, Flockhart could receive a 40-year  prison sentence, Bowman said.  </P> <P> Police believe that Flockhart, a gun enthusiast, traded drugs for the weapons.  Bowman said it appears Flockhart used the guns primarily for target shooting.  </P> <P> Among the 125 firearms were 12 illegal weapons. They included four  semiautomatic Uzi-type weapons, which had been converted to fully automatic  machine guns. Some guns had been outfitted with silencers, and five rifles were  fitted with illegally short barrels, Bowman said.  </P> <P> Flockhart also had Teflon-coated and armor-piercing bullets, which can  penetrate the bulletproof vests used by police officers.  </P> <P> Collectors' items such as two $5,000 miniature replicas of machine guns also  were found. The rest of the guns included pistols, semiautomatic assault  rifles, shotguns and hunting rifles, Bowman said.  </P> <P> Twenty-three of the 100 bladed weapons also were illegal, Bowman said. They  included six Shurikens, four-bladed weapons that are thrown like a Frisbee and  designed to stick in the target. Five brass knuckles and 12 gravity knives, in  which blades can be exposed with a flick of the wrist, also were found.  </P> <P> One of Flockhart's neighbors, who asked not to be identified, said others  suspected drug activity at the house but had no idea of the number of weapons  there.  </P> <P> "It was a big surprise, everything they found," the woman said. "None of us  thought all that was over there."  </P> <P> She said Flockhart, who had lived there about four years, enjoyed jogging and  was an avid sportsman, going deer hunting and bringing home venison.  </P> <P> All the guns seized in the raid Sunday will be forfeited to the state through  asset-forfeiture laws if Flockhart is convicted, Bowman said. The knives will  be ground up, he said.  </P> <P> The departments involved in the investigation stand to gain $700,000 to $1  million through state asset-forfeiture laws from the house, guns, six vehicles  and other belongings.  </P> <P> About 30 officers from five agencies were involved in the investigation -- the  Ventura Police Department, Oxnard Police Department, Simi Valley Police  Department, Ventura County Sheriff's Department and the district attorney's  office. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms was called in to  examine the firearms.  </P> <P> Bowman said he is sure that there are others above Flockhart, but added that  there is nothing to indicate that Colombian drug cartels are involved. He said  he does not expect more arrests.  </P> <P> Also, authorities say there is no evidence that this case is linked to the  August, 1989, bust in which a Simi Valley police investigation led to the  seizure of more than a ton of cocaine in Newhall and Chatsworth. Ten M-60  machine guns were seized during a raid that followed the breakup of a Colombian  drug ring operating in the area.  </P></p>

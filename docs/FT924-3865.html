			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Delay in register of MPs' interests THE register of MPs' business interests is unlikely to be published until mid January, and in the meantime, no one should have access to the computerised records already compiled, the cross-party committee on MPs' interests has decided, Alison Smith writes. The committee met this week for the first time since the April election, and approved the publication of the register, the timing of which now depends on the stationery office. The MPs decided that the computerised information should not be available before then even though many Labour MPs have expressed concern that there has already been undue delay in providing information about MPs' business connections.</p>

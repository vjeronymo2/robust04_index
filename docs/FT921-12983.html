			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: Sun Micro and Cray Research to collaborate SUN MICROSYSTEMS, the leading manufacturer of computer workstations, and Cray Research, the world leader in very high performance supercomputers, are to collaborate in the development of technology that will enable their products to work together more efficiently. Workstations are widely used in computer-aided design applications such as mechanical or electronic design, while supercomputer power is typically applied to the most challenging computing tasks such as modelling the performance of an airframe design. Both types of computers may, therefore, be used for related tasks. Cray Research will use technology developed by Sun Microsystems to build high performance computers based upon Sun's SPARC reduced instruction set computing (Risc) microprocessors. Cray said it intended to produce new high-end SPARC servers that are planned for delivery late in 1993, and may cost in the Dollars 1mto Dollars 3m range. However, it denied reports it might build a new type of supercomputer, called a massively parallel processor (MPP), based upon the SPARC chip. Cray is facing mounting competition from several new MPP entrants into the supercomputer, including Intel, the leading US microprocessor manufacturer. The agreement with Cray boosts Sun Microsystems' efforts to encourage the development of a wide range of computers based upon its SPARC architecture. For its part, Cray is diversifying its product line to include lower-cost computers at a time when sales of big supercomputers, which can cost as much as Dollars 20m, are flat.</p>

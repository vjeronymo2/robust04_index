			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Skeletal remains recovered this summer have turned a 9-year-old missing-person  case into a murder investigation, Madera County sheriff's deputies said.  Authorities have identified the remains found in an irrigation standpipe near  Madera as those of Robert Der Minasian, 26, of Fresno, who was last seen in  1980 when he went to swap motorcycle parts with a new friend. That friend,  identified as Jimmy Lee Sanders, 33, is being sought as the primary suspect in  Der Minasian's death, authorities said. Investigators have long considered  Sanders a suspect in Der Minasian's disappearance, but could not make a case  without a body, deputies said.  </P></p>

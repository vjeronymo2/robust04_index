Many of the remaining deals which did take place, occurred in a small number of consolidating sectors - such as commercial banking and cellular communications. According Securities Data, the US financial information group, only 4,464 deals were struck last year in the US, with a total value of Dollars 145.6bn (Pounds 80bn) This compared with 5,150 transactions, with a value of Dollars 211.9bn in 1990. However, activity in the US held up better than that worldwide. Global statistics showed a 38 per cent decline, from 9,273 deals valued at Dollars 498.4bn in 1990 to 8,340 deals worth Dollars 311.5bn last year. European merger volume fell sharply. In the US, merger news was dominated by activity in the communications sector - where GTE acquired Contel for Dollars 6.2bn, PacTel merged cellular operations with those of Cellular Communications in a Dollars 2.98bn deal, and Bell Atlantic bought Metro Mobile for Dollars 2.3bn - and in banking. The latter included a Dollars 4.3bn merger between NCNB and C&amp;S Sovran, and a Dollars 4.2bn deal between BankAmerica and Security Pacific. The global league table of investment bank advisers was headed by Goldman Sachs, advising on 126 deals with a combined value of Dollars 61.5bn. It was followed, in descending order, by Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and First Boston.

			<p>BFN     [Text] San Carlos de Bariloche, 16 May (NA) -- Tonight,  President Carlos Menem inaugurated here the Fourth  Ibero-American Information Science and Law Congress, whose  sessions will be held under the slogan "Quest for Integration."    The congress, sponsored by the Argentine Justice Ministry,  has been described as being of national interest, and has  gathered experts from America, Spain, Italy, and Belgium, among  other countries.    This congress, which will hold sessions until 20 May, has  been inspired by the issue of "the integration of  Ibero-America." The four key issues of this congress are state  reform, community law, the rights and liberties of individuals,  and technological compatibility.    Upon inaugurating the sessions, Menem said: "It is essential  to keep abreast through growth because it is not possible to  grow and advance unless we prepare our communities." Menem  emphasized: "Information is important, but communication is more  important still. We cannot be free unless we abide by the laws,  but wise laws."    For his part, Justice Minister Jorge Maiorano said at noon  today: "If we assume that it is true that information science is  linked to power, then we are astonished by the rapid changes."  Maiorano also stressed: "Technological progress must serve  human beings." He emphasized that "the use of information  science for the benefit of humanity" is in the hands of the  participants of this congress.    In addition to Menem and Maiorano, Rio Negro Vice Governor  Edgardo Gagliardi and Bariloche Mayor Maria Severino de Costa,  among other authorities, were present at the inauguration  ceremony.</p>

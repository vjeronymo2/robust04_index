			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONDO ADVANTAGES  </P> <P> Mike Eberts' Speaking Out on the benefits of living in a condo (Sept. 17) made  sense to me.  </P> <P> I particularly agree with the statement that condo owners can, unlike most  middle-income homeowners, virtually pick and choose what neighborhood they wish  to live in.  </P> <P> Most of us, I think, have a somewhat fallacious notion that the kind of house  you live in is more important than the type of neighborhood or, to extend the  analogy further, kind of community you live in.  </P> <P> Within the urban area, whose neighborhoods and communities differ so greatly in  such quality of life factors as crime, insurance rates, pollution, traffic  congestion, etc., I believe one should pick environment first and structure  second. That is, unless your goal is primarily to pursue real estate  speculation, which, obviously, many L.A. area homeowners do as "second  careers."  </P> <P> Of course, good neighborhoods are often where the highest values are, too!  </P> <P> I don't think living in L.A. has much of a future for many people. But condo  owners -- and renters -- at least have some consolation in that they can afford  to live in the few pockets of desirability.  </P> <P> WILLIAM L. SEAVEY  </P> <P> Sierra Madre  </P></p>

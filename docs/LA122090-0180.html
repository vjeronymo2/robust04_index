			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL ROCKED BY SCANDAL OVER PURCHASE OF U.S. WEAPONS  </P> <P> A major scandal involving allegations of kickbacks and fraud in the purchase of  U.S. weapons has rocked Israel's air force, implicating a number of senior  officials as well as several employees of U.S. defense firms, official sources  and Israeli news reports said Wednesday.  </P> <P> According to the reports, as many as a dozen senior air force and Defense  Ministry officials may be charged as a result of a police investigation into  the air force's procurement of equipment from U.S. contractors.  </P> <P> The equipment was bought with U.S. aid funds.  </P> <P> Police are investigating allegations that millions of dollars were diverted to  senior Israeli officers.  </P> <P> At the center of the investigation is Brig. Gen. Rami Dotan, 45, the Israeli  air force's quartermaster corps commander until his arrest Oct. 28. He later  struck a plea-bargain agreement under which he has begun to detail an elaborate  fraud, Israeli Radio reported.  </P> <P> Following up on Dotan's testimony, authorities Tuesday arrested another officer  in the quartermaster corps, Col. Yitzhak Sar, on charges of taking bribes and  obstructing earlier investigations, official sources said. Israeli Defense  Minister Moshe Arens on Wednesday ordered a full inquiry into the scandal,  according to the Israeli Embassy in Washington.  </P> <P> One American company cited in Israeli press accounts is General Electric, which  supplied jet engines for Israel's version of the F-16 fighter plane. A GE  spokesman confirmed the firm is "aware of an investigation by the Israeli  government" and is conducting its own investigation.  </P> <P> An official source said FBI agents are trying to determine whether U.S.  citizens or companies violated American laws in the case.  </P></p>

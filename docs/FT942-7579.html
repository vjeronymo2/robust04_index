			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Competitiveness - The White Paper: Clarke curbs Heseltine ambitions - Political view Mr Michael Heseltine has never been prone to understatement. So his claim yesterday that he had produced a 'formidable agenda for change and improvement across the public and private sectors' was unsurprising. But after five months of work by the cabinet's most senior ministers, the white paper disclosed a more complex reality. The ministers have analysed the problems facing the British economy. They have come up with a number of small but worthwhile initiatives. But they are still uncertain - and in many cases divided - on the overall prescription. The finished product bore the marks of a document which had seen the initial ambitions of Mr Heseltine firmly reined in by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. The central political point the government was determined to make was that it cares about business and it cares about the ability of British companies to compete in the world. Mr John Major, the prime minister, thinks his predecessor got it wrong during the 1980s when initial indifference towards the country's manufacturing base later turned into malign neglect. He believes the competitive challenge to Europe from the so-called Asian 'tigers' is still seriously underestimated. He admires the innovative culture which allows the US constantly to regenerate its economy. From that perspective it was essential to present a detailed analysis of the problems facing industry and an audit of the impact on business of government policies. The analysis in the white paper is its strongest point. It is the most comprehensive study of the performance of British industry and its relationship with government since 1979. The idea that it is entirely for the markets to decide what and how much Britain sells abroad has been quietly buried. Mr Heseltine and Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, are long-time political allies. Between them - and with the strong support of the prime minister - they have added substance to the recognition that high-quality education and training is critical to the success of British industry. Among others in the cabinet committee who contributed enthusiastically to the project were Mr William Waldegrave, science minister, and Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary. But the Treasury was less impressed. From the outset it suspected Mr Heseltine of clinging to the interventionist ambitions he formulated during the 1980s. Mr Clarke insisted that the white paper could not pre-empt any decisions in the forthcoming public spending round. He made it clear that he was not interested in any grandiose industrial strategy. The Treasury was also hesitant about the whole concept of competitiveness. It was keen on the document's essentially liberal approach to de-regulation, privatisation and open markets. But economic orthodoxy says that, while companies can improve their competitiveness, nations cannot. The Treasury would have preferred a 'productivity' white paper. The result, ministers acknowledged last night, was a document which acknowledges that government has a vital role in underpinning industrial success, but remains unsure of where to draw the line between support and intervention. The cabinet committee which produced the white paper will become a permanent fixture. Mr Major stressed that he was looking to the long term. Competitiveness is not an issue that will go away. But the government will have to decide whether it wants a policy for industry or an industrial policy.</p>

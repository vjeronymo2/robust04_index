			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STUDY FAVORS BARRIERS ON FREEWAY;  </P> <P> SURVEY: RESULTS INDICATE THAT IT IS THE BEST WAY TO REDUCE ACCIDENTS INVOLVING  UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT PEDESTRIANS ALONG THE I-5 NEAR BORDER CHECKPOINT.  </P> <P> A Cal State Fullerton survey has concluded that the erection of high barriers  along freeway medians is the best way to reduce the escalating numbers of  accidents involving undocumented immigrant pedestrians along Interstate 5 in  northern San Diego County.  </P> <P> The study, conducted at the behest of the California Department of  Transportation, seems likely to add impetus to the controversial idea of  constructing 10- to 12-foot median fences along the center divider of an 8-mile  stretch of I-5 just south of the Orange County line.  </P> <P> The concept of the so-called "I-5 Wall" has become an increasingly divisive one  in the border area, pitting the law enforcement agencies that are pushing the  concept against immigrant advocates who say it will do more harm than good,  trapping frightened pedestrians against an impenetrable wall.  </P> <P> Northbound undocumented immigrants seeking to avoid inspection at the U.S.  Border Patrol checkpoint at San Onofre regularly traverse the freeway on foot,  embarking upon an extremely hazardous trek around the inspection station.  </P> <P> Since 1987, according to the California Highway Patrol, fast-moving vehicles on  the freeway have struck 63 pedestrian immigrants in the area, killing 38 and  injuring 25. There have been 22 casualties so far this year -- a new record for  freeway carnage -- including 13 deaths and nine injuries.  </P> <P> Researchers at Cal State Fullerton, who are nearing the end of a yearlong,  Caltrans-sponsored study of the issue, found that 71% of all respondents in  their survey stated that such a barrier would be a "very effective" or  "extremely effective" device. The remaining 29% said a median fence would be  ineffective or only moderately useful.  </P> <P> The survey results are expected to influence the decision-making process of  Caltrans, which is now considering the erection of a fence in the freeway  median.  </P> <P> "We'll certainly pay attention to these findings in making our determination"  on whether to construct the barriers, said Jesus M. Garcia, district director  in San Diego for Caltrans.  </P> <P> Survey respondents included more than 100 policy-makers, academics, immigrant  advocates and others who have followed the evolving issue.  </P> <P> Other tactics favored by those surveyed included a variety of less  controversial approaches, such as the improvement of roadway lighting, the  installation of signs alerting motorists and pedestrians to the danger, and the  removal of roadside shrubbery that provides cover to pedestrians.  </P> <P> But the barrier concept, backed by the CHP and the U.S. Immigration and  Naturalization Service, remains the most provocative alternative.  </P> <P> A decision on the barrier proposal is likely within weeks, said Garcia, who  spoke at a meeting in San Diego where the survey findings were unveiled and  discussed. A public hearing is possible but not definite before the decision is  made, he said. Construction of such a barrier in northern San Diego County  would probably take two years and cost about $1 million, authorities said.  </P> <P> Supporters of the barrier concept say such structures will reduce the  likelihood of immigrants attempting to cross the freeway.  </P> <P> But immigrant advocates and others contend that such structures could actually  increase the carnage by trapping frightened pedestrians on the roadway median.  A wall or fence will do little to discourage immigrants who have come this far,  opponents argue.  </P> <P> Gene Begnell, who is a battalion fire chief in San Clemente, said his agency  feared that such a barrier could hamper life-saving efforts along the freeway  by limiting emergency access to both sides of the freeway.  </P></p>

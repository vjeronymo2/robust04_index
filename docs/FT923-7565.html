			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Concern at 'misjudgments' by big international banks LEADING international banks suffered from weakening profitability and worsening asset quality during the 1980s, an article in the Bank of England's quarterly bulletin suggests. The banks lent money to less-developed countries and the property sector, and became involved in highly-leveraged transactions based on an expectation that relatively benign economic conditions would continue, it argues. They often lent in areas with which they were 'relatively unfamiliar' in an attempt to improve returns at a time of aggressive expansion and competition. The bulletin suggests that adjustments to the new environments of deregulation and greater competition may have led to 'misjudgments in the assessment and pricing of risk'. It points out that it is very difficult to compare levels of profitability internationally because of differences in accounting and taxation practices. German and Swiss accountancy conventions smooth year-to-year fluctuations in earnings via transfers to and from hidden reserves, for example. The paper highlights four responses to the pressures of the last decade which have been adopted by the international banks: Improved capitalisation and better risk-pricing: driven by the 1988 Basle capital adequacy guidelines, banks have taken measures such as increasing debt and equity issues, borrowing on a wider range of markets, and increasing spreads and fees. International retrenchment: many banks have been forced by third world debt and the deterioration of corporate and property loan portfolios in overseas markets to reduce their foreign operations and focus on specialist niches. A shift to non-interest earnings: banks have increased the power of their retail franchises by greater involvement in fee-based retail and securities business, driven by competition from capital markets and non-bank financial institutions, as well as by the development of information technology. Cost control: banks have cut staff and branches, introduced new technology and engaged in mergers and acquisitions over the last two years which have contributed to some improvement in earnings.

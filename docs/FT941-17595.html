			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / World News in Brief: Footsie rises 20 per cent on year The FT-SE 100 index gained more than 16 points on the London stock market in early trading yesterday, backed by a buy programme from one of the UK securities houses. But the day's peak of 3,445.3 was 35 points short of the year's trading high reached on Thursday. Yesterday's final reading, taken at 12.30pm, showed the Footsie at 3,418.4, down 10.4. The year's closing high of 3,462 was recorded on Wednesday. Over the year, the Footsie has risen by 20 per cent, or 571.9 points, driven by falling interest rates and growing confidence in economic recovery.

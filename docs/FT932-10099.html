			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: NHS waiting lists at record level HOSPITAL WAITING lists have grown by more than 8 per cent since the general election to reach a record high of almost 1m, provisional figures released yesterday by the Department of Health show. The number waiting for treatment in the National Health Service rose to 992,324 in March, up more than 74,000 on a year before. The worst performing region in the last quarter was North East Thames, which recorded a rise of 10 per cent in people waiting less than a year. This means the number of 11-month waiters has risen by 24 per cent in the region over the past 12 months. Government campaigns to reduce long waiting times have all but eliminated delays of more than two years for operations, and cut the numbers waiting between one and two years by almost a third. Just over 56,000 people have been waiting for more than a year for treatment. But the number of patients waiting up to a year for treatment has risen by 12 per cent since last April's general election. The figures will fuel criticism that the government has reduced waiting lists between one and two years at the expense of people waiting less than a year with more serious conditions. Mr David Blunkett, Labour's health spokesman, said the figures were 'a disaster for patients' and he called for a review of government health policy. 'These figures mean that 1,500 people have joined the waiting list every week since the general election,' he said. Mr Blunkett said that the figures underestimated the numbers and that Labour party research showed some people had to wait more than a year before they even appeared on official lists. Mr Tom Sackville, the health minister, acknowledged that the waiting list had grown but said that the figures showed that waiting times had continued to fall. 'Half of all admissions to hospital are immediate,' he said. 'Of those admitted from waiting lists, half are admitted within five weeks, nearly three quarters within three months and 98 per cent within a year.' Mr Sackville also said that the government would spend Pounds 39m this year tackling long waiting times, bringing the total spent on this to Pounds 240m over seven years. Labour last night launched a Commons attack on government plans to merge district health authorities in England, warning of a loss of public accountability, but their call to annul the orders introducing the changes was defeated by 235 votes to 187, a government majority of 48.</p>

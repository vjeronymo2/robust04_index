			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Lebanese go on rampage against economic hardship HUNDRED of Lebanese demonstrators yesterday protested against the collapse of the Lebanese pound by setting fire to the home of the country's finance minister, beating up policemen, closing down businesses and ransacking foreign exchange shops. The unrest broke out after radio broadcasts announced that the pound, once one of the strongest currencies in the region, was selling at an all-time low of LPounds 2,100 to the dollar on the black market. It traded at LPounds 2.5 to the dollar before the 1975-90 civil war. Protesters in the southern city of Tyre shouting 'Down with a government that starves its people,' converged on the home of Mr Ali Al-Khalil, the finance minister, before burning it down. Mr Khalil was in Beirut at the time and the crowd of around 300 left when 25 soldiers arrived. Yesterday's riots marked the first violent expressions of protest since Lebanon's economic crisis began to worsen in February. The government sent troops to Sidon and Tyre to reopen roads blocked by hundreds of burning tyres, while the country's main trade union called a three-day general strike to begin today. However, the Confederation of Trade Unions which called the strike rejected proposals for unlimited action because it would only increase people's suffering. The general exhaustion which followed the end of 15 years of civil war, along with the continued the presence in the country of 40,000 Syrian troops, make a full-scale revolt unlikely. Since the Lebanese pound began a precipitate decline in February prices of basic commodities have in some cases doubled or trebled. Most wage-earners are paid in Lebanese pounds and many people say they never knew such hardship even during the war. Merchants - who must pay dollars for their imports  - claim they are still making losses. Yesterday petrol stations and shops refused to accept Lebanese pounds. The crisis contrasts with the optimism last summer, when the Central Bank stabilised the pound at LPounds 879 to the dollar and tens of thousands of Lebanese emigrees returned to the country. But, disillusioned by its shattered infrastructure, red tape and corruption, most returnees left in the autumn and the repatriation of funds stopped. Since the war ended in 1990, promised reconstruction aid has also failed to materialise. The pound began to plunge in February after private sector pay rose by more than 100 per cent and the Central Bank announced that it would no longer deplete its limited reserves to shore up the pound. Mr Omar Karami, the prime minister, put the present plunge in confidence down to a 'foreign plot' against the Lebanese economy, but banking and business sources say the the crisis has more to do with government over-spending and mismanagement. Nevertheless, the government has increased its revenues in the past two months, set a ceiling on spending and limited its borrowing from the Central Bank. But these measures have not succeeded in restoring confidence and the crisis now appears as much political as economic. Anger has focused on Mr Karami, who yesterday went to Damascus for talks with Syrian officials - prompting speculation that he may resign. An Nahar, the respected Beirut newspaper, said that the Karami government might not last until the end of the week and predicted he would be replaced by Dr Selim El-Hoss, the economist and former prime minister, or by Mr Rafiq Hariri, the Lebanese-born Saudi multi-millionaire.</p>

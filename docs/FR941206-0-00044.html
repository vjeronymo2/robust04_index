			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, because Colorado's proposed rules are more stringent and environmentally protective than the corresponding Federal regulations, which is provided for in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11(b), the Director finds that Colorado's disallowance of the use of real property as a form of collateral bond at Rules 1.04(25), 3.02.4(1)(b), and 3.02.4(2)(c)(ix), is no less effective than the counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.5(b)(5) and 800.21(c) concerning the use of real property as a form of collateral bond. Therefore, the Director approves Colorado's disallowance of real property to support a collateral bond by deleting all references to ``real property'' from Rules 1.04(25), 3.02.4(1)(b), and 3.02.4(2)(c)(ix). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Rules 1.04(116), 3.02.4(1)(c), and 3.02.4(2)(e), Self-Bonds <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Colorado proposed to disallow the use of a self-bond as a bond form by deleting in their entirety (1) Rule 1.04(116), the definition of ``self-bond,'' and (2) Rules 3.02.4(1)(c) and 3.02.4(2)(e), which allow for the use of self-bonds. Colorado defines ``self-bond'' to mean the bond of an applicant itself accompanied by one or more perfected first-lien security interests in real property located in Colorado. Colorado's disallowance of the use of self-bonds is consistent with its proposed disallowance of the use of real property to support a collateral bond, as discussed in finding No. 2.b above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.12 require that a regulatory authority prescribe the form of the performance bond, but allow the regulatory authority to choose to prescribe a surety bond, a collateral bond, a self-bond, or a combination of any of these bonding methods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the regulatory authority is not obligated to allow all bond forms, the Director finds that Colorado's proposed deletion of use of self-bonds at Rules 1.04(116), 3.02.4(1)(c), and 3.02.4(2)(e) is consistent with and no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.12. Therefore, the Director approves the deletion of Rules 1.04(116), 3.02.4(1)(c), and 3.02.4(2)(e). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Rules 3.02.1(7) and 3.03.1(3)(e), Bond Liability on Areas With Approved Alternative Postmining Land Uses <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> a. Rule 3.02.1(7), Exemption From Bond Liability for Implementation of Features of an Alternative Postmining Land Use That Are Beyond the Control of the Permittee <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Colorado proposed to revise Rule 3.02.1(7) to clarify that the permittee is excused from bond liability for implementation of features of an alternative postmining land use, approved under Rule 4.16.3, that are beyond the control of the permittee. Colorado explained in its ``Statement of Basis, Specific Statutory Authority, and Purpose,'' submitted with the proposed amendment, that ``the exemption provision is intended to apply only to actual implementation of those features of an approved alternative post-mining land use outside the scope of the reclamation plan, such as construction of an industrial or commercial or residential development.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.13(d)(2) indicate that a bond need not cover the implementation of an alternative postmining land use that is approved under the alternative postmining land use criteria at 30 CFR 816.133(c) and 817.133(c) and that is beyond the control of the permittee. In response to comments regarding a petition to amend the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Subchapter J, OSM justified the language at 30 CFR 800.13(d)(2), previously proposed as 805.13(e) and codified as 805.13(f), by explaining that <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [I]t is unreasonable to require the surety to assume liability for completion of an alternative post mining land use plan as a condition of release of a performance bond. There is no way that a surety can guarantee that *&blank;*&blank;* houses [are] built or an industrial complex [is] developed. In many cases a third party land owner who may be different than the operator would be required to develop the post mining land use and would not be held liable under performance bond by the surety. Therefore, the surety would not have any guarantee that the land owner would develop the property as part of the operators postmining land use. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> (44 FR 28005, 28007, May 14, 1979). Therefore, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.13(d) exclude from bond liability features of an approved alternative postmining land use outside the scope of the reclamation plan, such as construction of a residential or an industrial development. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

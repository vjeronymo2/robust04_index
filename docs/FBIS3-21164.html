The  Demonstration ATR Construction Promotion Committee comprised of  representatives from the electric power industry, MITI, STA,  etc., will make its decision in the near future. The  construction plan that will be presented to the Electric Power  Development Coordination Council in December 1994 will call for  construction to begin in April 1997 and operation to begin in  2003.    The plan has been delayed by lengthy negotiations over  compensation with the local fishermen's union, but the Oma  Fishermen's Association decided to accept the prefecture's  mediation concerning additional fishing industry compensation,  so it is possible that negotiations will finally move forward  once again.    This is the seventh postponement since the Promotion  Committee first hammered out the demonstration ATR construction  process in 1985.</p>

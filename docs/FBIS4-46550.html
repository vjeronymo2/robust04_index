			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Armies and Battlefronts Cannot Be Run With </F> Roundups"]    [Text] What is happening today in the capital's streets,  roads, bus and metro stations, markets and coffee shops is  beyond anyone's imagination. Classic Armenian disorganization  and cottage-industry and self-enterprise mentality could not  have taken a worse form than the means that have been "selected"  for the organization of the current conscription drive. At  virtually every step men, especially young ones, are targeted  for roundups that use the crudest methods: force, brutality and  disparagement. What is being done behind slogans of defending  the fatherland and mobilizing the Army is discrediting the  entire essence of this worthy program. As a result, neither the  Army can be properly mobilized nor can the defense of the  borders of the fatherland become more sound. Instead, fear,  panic and demoralization may overtake people's minds, perhaps in  an irreversible manner.    What is most disturbing, however, is not the roundups but  the  mistrust which follows them. In the past few days our office has  received numerous reports that the individuals who are in charge  of these "operations" rob and plunder indiscriminately  everyone--those who are liable as well as those who are not  liable for military service--with insatiable enthusiasm. Our  information about the seizure of cash and jewelry and the  collection of bribes in American dollars has already gone beyond  the limits of rumors. Strong protests are heard especially from  those who cannot afford to "liberate" their kin, because they  think that if they had the means their sons and husbands would  not be taken to the Army and that the defense of the Army would  not have turned into a "merchants'" business.    Yes, mistrust rules everywhere, and the minister of state  responsible for defense [Vazgen Sargsyan] could not dispel that  mistrust with his well-known television address. He could not  dispel it by presenting the conscription drive as a personal,  almost private, task to the people without taking into account  Armenia's morale and psychological state, the socioeconomic  condition of the people, the presence of foreign influences that  corrupt the young, the natural fear of military service and  especially the political capital that the ruling group has lost  amongst the people.    Since there is no organization or press organ which opposes  a  strong army and a sound defense, an important task such as the  conscription drive should have been arranged pannationally as  befits a state in a truly organized and professional manner with  the appropriate propaganda.    Otherwise, with the current foul means we can have neither a  combat-ready army nor a sound defense.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> KABUKI: The Grand Kabuki of Japan, appearing this weekend at the Orange County  Performing Arts Center, survives in part because of Faubion Bowers, one-time  secretary to Gen. Douglas MacArthur. . . . Bowers tried to persuade the general  to lift the ban on Kabuki in postwar Japan, "but he was a cultural numskull. He  never went to a concert, never went to a play, never read a book -- except the  Bible. 'Kabuki?' he said. 'What's that?' "  </P></p>

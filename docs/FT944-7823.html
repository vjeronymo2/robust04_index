			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / People: Porvair Allen Halliwell, 58, the former technical director of Porvair, one of the world's leading producers of microporous materials, is retiring after 25 years with the group. Halliwell was one of the three directors who helped organise the management buy-out from United Technologies in 1982. The other two are Doug Berwick, a former finance director, who retired nearly ten years ago, and John Morgan, 55, the chairman. Halliwell, who steps down at the end of November, is currently managing director of the group's Middlesex-based Porvair Filtronics, a medical diagnostics subsidiary and the smallest of Porvair's businesses. Ken Symonds, Porvair's finance director, said that the group was sad to lose Halliwell and wished him a long and happy retirement. However, Symonds stressed that his departure would not damage Porvair's technological lead in microporous materials. Porvair spends 5 per cent of its turnover on research and development and has 40 technologists on its 370 staff.</p>

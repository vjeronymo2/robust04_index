			<p>BFN     [Text] If elected as the first Belarusian president,  present Belarusian Premier Vyacheslav Kebich will undertake  urgent measures in order to stop the run-away growth in prices  and carry out wide-scale actions to fight crime.    The presidential elections in Belarus will take place on 23  June. A total of six candidates for presidency have been  officially registered, including Kebich, Belarusian parliament's  ex-speaker Stanislav Shushkevich, the Belarusian opposition  People's Front leader Zenon Poznyak and Communist leader Vasili  Novikov.    Kebich said in an exclusive interview with INTERFAX that, if  elected the president, he would carry out the agreement on the  merging of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems. Kebich  is considered one of the most likely winners of the presidential  race.    However, he emphasized that the budgets of the two countries  would not be merged. Kebich said that only two budget items  would be coordinated -- the deficit and the amount of money  issued.    Speaking about his contenders, Kebich feared that Zenon  Poznyak might win the presidential elections. Kebich suggested  that if Poznyak be elected, Belarus would face war, bloodshed  and elimination of human rights and liberties.    He added that if the People's Front won the elections, this  would mean a catastrophe for the whole Belarusian people.  Kebich confirmed his suggestion by referring to the recent  statement by Poznyak in the media. Poznyak had put forward  territorial claims to Russia, Lithuania and Poland. Kebich said  this was a dangerous policy which would lead to bloodshed.</p>

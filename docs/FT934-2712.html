			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Yorkshire TV group to defer results Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television will announce today that it is deferring publication of its financial results until the end of January and passing its final dividend. The company had always said it would announce its results for the year to September tomorrow. Last month the north-east ITV company warned that a loss was likely for the 1992-93 year because of unexpected problems on advertising sales, through overtrading - selling more air time than it had available - and pulling advertising revenue forward by offering heavy discounts. The company will promise today that pre-tax losses for the year are unlikely to exceed Pounds 9.5m. The final figures may be up to Pounds 1m lower. Meanwhile the Yorkshire board has given permission for LWT to explore in detail an agreed bid to take over Yorkshire. As part of the proposals Anglia Television would buy Tyne Tees. The deal is designed to fend off a hostile bid from the Granada group for LWT. The Yorkshire-Tyne Tees announcement will come on the day that the House of Lords debates government proposals which will allow one company to hold two broadcasting licences. LWT hopes government liberalisation of ownership rules will allow LWT, Yorkshire, Tyne Tees and Anglia to join together to form the largest ITV grouping. Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada, the television rental and leisure group, is pushing ahead with his takeover bid for LWT. Mr Robinson said yesterday: 'Granada and LWT make a perfect fit.' Central Television shareholders will today receive the details of the Carlton Communications offer which values Central, the second largest ITV company, at Pounds 814m, equal to Pounds 27.92 for each Central ordinary share.</p>

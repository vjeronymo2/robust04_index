			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TEEN VANDAL SUSPECT ESCAPES  </P> <P> A teen-age suspect, booked on suspicion of vandalism, slipped out of his  handcuffs, vaulted over a counter and escaped through the front door of the  Lennox sheriff's station about 7 p.m. Wednesday, deputies said.  </P> <P> Juveniles detained at the Lennox station are handcuffed to a chair in the lobby  until they can be transferred to another facility. They cannot be housed with  adults in the station's cells, Lt. Anthony Denis said, and there is no other  place to keep them. While in the lobby, juveniles are watched by a jailer, an  assistant jailer and, from behind a two-way mirror, the watch commander.  </P> <P> At the time of the escape, however, the assistant jailer was counting prisoners  in another section of the station while the jailer completed paper work in an  office out of sight of the juvenile.  </P> <P> When the watch commander realized that the juvenile was escaping, he yelled,  and deputies chased the youth but did not catch him.  </P> <P> The juvenile had been picked up three hours earlier after he was seen  spray-painting the wall of a beauty salon in the 10500 block of South Normandie  Avenue.  </P></p>

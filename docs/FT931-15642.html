			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pressure grows for press laws CROSS-PARTY support for legislation to prohibit snooping, whether by electronic surveillance, telephoto lenses or trespass, was mounting yesterday following the widespread leaking of the Calcutt report on press behaviour. But MPs were divided over whether the government could or should set up a powerful statutory press complaints tribunal with recourse to the courts - reportedly the most formidable proposal by Sir David Calcutt QC. The cabinet, which will discuss the report on Thursday, is divided on the question. While Mr John Major, Mr Douglas Hurd and Mr Kenneth Clarke are understood to favour action, others have doubts about the feasibility of devising effective legislation. For Labour, Ms Ann Clwyd, the shadow heritage secretary, expressed concern that the leaks did not reveal any moves to balance right-of-reply provisions with guarantees on the right to know. Accusing some Fleet Street editors of 'hysterical' reactions to the report, she said there was now much support across the country for statutory restraints on the press. She supported the private member's bill tabled by Mr Clive Soley, Labour MP for Hammersmith, to set up a body to enforce the right of reply, targeted chiefly at protecting private citizens. But she expressed doubts about the possibility of effective legal restraints without a freedom of information act to protect press freedoms. Opinions among Conservatives were divided. Backbenchers have expressed anger at press intrusions into the private lives of the royal family, and at the coverage of recent events involving Mr Norman Lamont and Mr David Mellor. But several have cautioned that the government must take care before launching a vendetta against newspapers, many of which offered loyal support to the party during the last general election. Labour backbenchers are concerned, however, that the leaking of the Calcutt conclusions might undermine Mr Soley's bill, which will have a second reading on January 29. Mr Soley said he believed the leak would increase cross-party backing for the bill. Lord McGregor, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, confirmed last night that he had written to Sir David Calcutt in December saying that the Princess of Wales had been 'participating in the provision of information for tabloid editors about the state of her marriage.' Lord McGregor said the actions of the Princess 'seriously embarrassed' the commission, which had issued a statement condemning coverage of the royal marriage after being assured by Buckingham Palace that the Princess was not involved in any leak.</p>

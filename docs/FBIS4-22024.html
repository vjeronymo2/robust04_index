			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Berlin (DPA) -- According to an intelligence  service note, the Mykonos attack in Berlin was allegedly planned  in the Iranian Embassy in Bonn. On Thursday [14 April] during  the trial at the Berlin Court concerning the attack [on the  Mykonos restaurant in Berlin on 17 September 1992, which killed  four Iranian opposition members] Joint Plaintiff Axel Jeschke  quoted from an intelligence service document: "Several clues  from a particularly reliable source lead one to conclude that  the Mykonos attack was prepared in the Embassy under the code  term Bozorg Alavi." Bernd Schmidbauer (Christian Democratic  Union), coordinator for intelligence services in the  chancellor's office, stated as a witness, when asked by Jeschke,  that he could not recall such a paper.    On the fringe of the trial, Jeschke told journalists that  the  court files are not complete. "Not all documents have been put  on the table." In contrast, Schmidbauer insisted that, as far  as he knows, all relevant papers and information provided by the  intelligence services have been made available to the court.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The first meeting of the new Council of Ministers  began at the Chigi Palace a short time ago. Let's go to  Francesco Pionati.    [Pionati] Yes, the old guard has changed. The Ciampi  executive has left office and has been replaced by the  Berlusconi executive, which arrived here to hold the first  meeting of the Council of Ministers. The meeting will be a short  one and is needed to approve the choices of the new prime  minister. These choices have already been made public; in other  words, the appointments of the new deputy prime ministers --  Giuseppe Tatarella from the National Alliance and Roberto Maroni  from the Northern League -- and the appointment of Gianni Letta  to the post of under secretary to the Council of Ministers.  Letta is already Berlusconi's right-hand man at Fininvest.    A second Council of Ministers meeting may be held tomorrow.  This will serve to approve the appointments of the new under  secretaries, or the deputy ministers as they are now called.    In the meantime, there have been further reactions to the  Berlusconi government. Obviously the Freedom Alliance is  extremely pleased, but the reaction of the opposition has been  very scathing. This morning the Greens and La Rete [The  Network] criticized the methods that led to the formation of the  new government. They said the methods were the same as those  used under the old political system.    Now let's listen to the views of Gianfranco Fini, on behalf  of the Freedom Alliance, and Luigi Berlinguer and Rosa Russo  Jervolino from the opposition -- from the left and the center  respectively.    [Begin recording] [Fini] We are convinced that the formation  of the Berlusconi government and the entry of five ministers  from the National Alliance is an important landmark for Italy  because it is the end of a democracy based on exclusion -- in  other words a democracy based upon the ostracism of the parties  with regard to the Right. The entry of the National Alliance in  the government is the demonstration of the fact that today in  Italy, as is the case throughout the rest of Europe and the  West, the legitimization of the government is established by the  free vote of the electorate.    [Berlinguer] Poor Berlusconi, my heart bleeds for him  because he had to find an agreement for the impossible. He had  to accommodate the Cossiga and Craxi factions, the followers of  Andreotti and De Lorenzo, the men from his company, and finally  the Italian Social Movement, the so-called postfascists, who are  not very post and instead very tarred with the brush of fascism.  What we have is a sort of mishmash that could have been better  formulated by a chemist. Some of the ministers do not have much  experience. We will see what happens, but the government has  not gotten off to a good start.    [Jervolino] We from the Italian Popular Party are very  concerned. We are worried at the way in which the government  has been formed -- it has been a long drawn out carving up of  ministries between the members of the Freedom Alliance. We are  also concerned at the composition of the government and by the  fact that sensitive posts have been given to people who do not  have the necessary experience. We are also concerned by the  presence of neofascists. We will wait to see what the  government's program is, but already we believe that the  composition of the government confirms our choice of going into  opposition. [end recording]</p>

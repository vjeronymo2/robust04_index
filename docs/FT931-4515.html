			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Arts: The Importance of Being Earnest - Theatre OSCAR Wilde's best known work always had a claim to be the wittiest play in the English language. In Nicholas Hytner's exquisite new production at The Aldwych, it wins the prize hands down. Savouring the delights, I shall come to Maggie Smith's Lady Bracknell last. There is plenty more on show. The two parts that hit you most, almost as if they had never been played before, are Claire Skinner's Cecily and Margaret Tyzack's Miss Prism. This is a Cecily (remember the pronunciation - Sissely) who will never be upstaged by Gwendolen. She may be a girl of 18 brought up in the country, but she is fairly brimming with determination and self-confidence: a Lady Bracknell in embryo. It is no disrespect to Susannah Harker's Gwendolen to say that this is the first time that Cecily seems to be the better part. Ms Harker accepts the downgrading with grace. The secret about Ms Tyzack's Miss Prism is that she is really and obviously attractive from the start: not at all the plain spinster sometimes suggested. She is a very clever woman, and not ashamed of it. And that, too, is one of the secrets of Hytner's production: The Importance is presented as a highly cerebral, even intellectual play. True, the women are more intelligent than the men, but that only adds to the wit. Possibly not everyone knows that 'earnest' was once the in-word for 'gay'. That again adds to the fun: the young women in the play know this perfectly well, which is why they love the name and Lady Bracknell has a particular reason for disliking it. Intellectual in-jokes abound. Take the frequent references to the German language. Is it a precise or a romantic form compared to English? Note the peculiarly modern use of the word 'entrapped' and Cecily's near borrowing from Lear in 'Never, never, never'. The Importance is such a good play that you can enjoy it for the plot and the performances alone. Hytner's production pulls out every stop. The sets by Bob Crowley get better and better as we move from Half-Moon Street in London W something, to the garden and then the morning-room at the Manor House, Woolton. There can be few more pleasurable comic scenes than Gwendolen and Cecily together at tea outside the house. Remember the business of the sugar lumps. If the men are intellectually inferior, they can still act. Watch the sudden swelling in Richard E Grant's cheek when, as Algernon dressed in mourning clothes he confronts the brother he has invented, then banished. The facial movements are even better than most of his lines. With incidental delights like that, who needs Lady Bracknell and how can she played in a way that seems fresh? Ms Smith triumphs by presenting Lady B as an immensely well educated woman, up with the latest statistics and intellectual fashions. To be sure, she is a snob to boot, but that makes her the more formidable: she knows how to be a snob well. She also has a proper respect for money and an understanding of investment. Ms Smith deals with the famous 'handbag' line by taking it in her stride as not being especially remarkable. Then she strikes: the stress comes a little later with 'the line is immaterial'. This is a marvellous example of an actress teasing the audience, then creating a new reading. See towards the end, the way she says of Algernon: 'He has nothing, but he looks everything.' Physical movements again crown the text. In short, this is a perfect evening, and it adds to the pleasure that other women should be allowed to run Lady Bracknell close. The Aldwych.

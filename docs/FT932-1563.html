			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Kiev's hollow victory: Tough choices facing Ukraine The 10-day miners' strike in eastern Ukraine has ended, but for the Ukrainian government it is a pyrrhic victory. To get the miners back to work, it offered them a package of wage increases and coal price subsidies which ministers admit could push the country into hyperinflation by the autumn. The sharp deterioration in the economy threatens not just the stability of Ukraine, the second most populous former Soviet republic. It also has implications for the region. Relations between Ukraine and Russia are already tense: several disputes between the two following the break-up of the Soviet Union are unresolved. A deterioration in Kiev's relations with the large and restless Russian-speaking population in its industrial eastern region could fuel tension with Moscow. In contrast to Kiev's failure to implement economic reforms, one political goal has been effectively pursued: President Leonid Kravchuk's aim of bolstering Ukraine as an independent state by creating its own army. In the past two years, Ukraine has built an army of half a million soldiers, armed with sophisticated conventional weapons produced in the former Soviet Union. Further, Ukraine could be on the brink of becoming a nuclear power. It is likely the government will choose to retain, at least temporarily, some of the 176 inter-continental ballistic missiles on its territory. But while Ukraine may be growing stronger militarily, its economy is increasingly impoverished. The main reason for its decline is the central bank's runaway printing press. Under pressure from Russia, which felt Ukraine was exporting inflation, Kiev introduced its own independent currency, the coupon. So far, the coupon's brief life has been a disaster. Since January, the currency has plunged to only a sixth of its value against the dollar and, even before this week's hand-out to the miners, inflation was running at more than 30 per cent a month. The economic outlook is likely to worsen. To appease the miners, the government promised a package worth 13 trillion coupons, a figure equal to nearly half the tax revenues Kiev expects to collect this year. The subsidies come on top of the 2 trillion coupons the Ukrainian parliament agreed to pay to the agricultural sector last week. Announcing the payments, Mr Ivan Illin, deputy minister of finance, pointed out that 'agreeing with the miners' demands will lead to a 15-fold increase in consumer prices. This is hyperinflation'. Stagflation - inflation and recession simultaneously - might be a more accurate description. As the value of Ukraine's money has fallen, so has its output. Western economists estimate that national output overall fell by 16 per cent last year. Among the largest sectors, industrial production declined 10 per cent while there was an 11 per cent fall in agriculture, Ukraine's traditional mainstay, accounting for about a fifth of national ouput. Industry has been hit by Ukraine's lack of competitiveness on world markets; a collapse in trade with Ukraine's traditional partners in the former Soviet Union, and a collapse in military orders since the union disintegrated. Though combined inflation and recession are no strangers to the post-communist economies of eastern Europe, Ukraine's crisis is especially notable since it has not even begun the fundamental reform - such as that undertaken in neighbouring Poland - that might hold out hope of recovery. Recession and a leap in prices in Poland were the short-term pain dictated by the transition to a market economy. In contrast, Ukraine's feuding government has introduced a patchwork of policies which have disrupted the old, centrally planned economy but failed to create a market system to replace it. Some prices have been freed, but controls on many others remain. As a result, although consumers have suffered price rises typical of the 'shock therapy' approach to reforms, prices for agricultural goods remain artificially low compared with those for manufactured products. This disparity has left farms so impoverished that the government has little choice but to grant agricultural credits or risk allowing Ukraine's fields lie fallow. Home-grown economic woes are exacerbated by the country's dependence on subsidised Russian fuel. Russia is increasing its oil prices to match those on world markets. This, coupled with an agreement between Moscow and Kiev to conduct all trade at world prices by the end of the year, means Ukraine faces a balance of payments gap of between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 4bn this year. Ukraine's main hope of recovering from its economic malaise is rapidly to implement a combination of tighter monetary policy and structural reforms, such as lifting price controls, subsidies and embarking on privatisation. Mr Leonid Kuchma, prime minister, who says he backs such a strategy, has been unable to get reform under way because of his battle with the president and parliament over who should be running the country. If Kiev were to demonstrate its commitment to economic change, it could expect western financial assistance, particularly to help cover its trade deficit. An IMF programme tailored to do that was in the pipeline, but the internecine conflict in Kiev which erupted in May halted the negotiations and delayed indefinitely the delivery of IMF assistance. The political battle in Kiev is one reason the government has failed to implement reform. Another is that, as the miners' strike demonstrated, Ukraine is a fragile young nation, with a weak sense of national identity. The government is paying subsidies to unprofitable industries in part because it wants to keep the country together: it fears that widespread closures could undermine the loyalty of millions of mainly Russian-speaking Ukrainians in the east. The black-faced, red-hatted miners know the government is in a quandary. But Kiev cannot afford to continue indefinitely to subsidise loss-making industries and postpone real reform. The brush with the miners of the Donbass was perhaps only a taste of what is to come.</p>

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Trading places The decision by Sir Bryan Carsberg to step down early as director general of fair trading next May, just three years into his five-year term, is to be regretted. He has carried out a difficult and important job well, and has attempted to strengthen some of the more positive features of Britain's competition policy. His departure raises uncomfortable questions about how well these characteristics will survive. Sir Bryan has cast himself as the consumer's champion, and approached cases with the principle that markets should be freed from anti-competitive restraints, unless such limits can be shown to benefit the consumer. He took a particular interest in vertical restraints to trade, suggesting that examples in ice-cream, fine fragrances and car dealerships were against consumers' interests. That approach increasingly put him in conflict with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which has been generally more sympathetic to the producer interest. The MMC has tended to regard vertical restraints as tolerable provided that competition exists in a market. The onus of showing that a company's practices are damaging to consumers' interest lies on the shoulders of competitors or consumers themselves, in the MMC's view. One of the frustrations of Sir Bryan's job, has been the MMC's rejection of his views in such cases which have been referred by the OFT. To an extent, Sir Bryan's approach also put him at loggerheads with the Department of Trade and Industry, which has shown itself more favourable to the MMC point of view. Maybe Sir Bryan should have struck an even louder and more discordant note. His ability to do so has been partly restrained by the steady shift of responsibility for competition policy from national capitals to Brussels. This trend seems set to continue, as the development of the single market brings ever more cases within the jurisdiction of the European Commission. Nonetheless, national authorities will still have important work to do, notably in respect of mergers involving companies with purely domestic business or where an overriding national interest is at stake. In his final months, Sir Bryan must deal with several potentially controversial cases, such as the bids for shipbuilders VSEL by GEC and BAe, and the proposed merger of the Leeds and Halifax building societies. Competition policy serves the consumer. As often as not, this is best achieved by allowing companies to pursue profitable activities within competitive markets. But the system also needs a gadfly to keep government and business on their toes. This is how Sir Bryan worked: Mr Heseltine should seek a replacement with similar characteristics: no yes-men should apply. It may not be an easy job for the head hunters.</p>

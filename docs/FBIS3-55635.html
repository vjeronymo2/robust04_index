			<p>Language: <F P=105>Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Following the publication in the 7 January edition  of HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN of a statement made in Vanadzor by  Garnik Isagulyan, an Armenian parliamentarian, member of the  Armenian Revolutionary Federation [ARF], and member of the ARF's  parliamentary group, the Armenian Foreign Ministry Press Service  asked Foreign Minister Vahan Papazyan to comment on Isagulyan's  statements.    Papazyan said: I think the ARF must publicly clarify its  position on this member because the Armenian security organs  must know whose political views Isagulyan expressed--his own or  ARF's. If they are party views, then the Armenian Justice  Ministry must open a serious investigation into the ARF's  programs and decide on the legality of the party.    It would be logical to expect parliament to express its  position on a member.    Regrettably, this is not the first time a deputy of the  Armenian Supreme Council has issued overt or covert threats or  calls to topple the government in an illegitimate way. Sadly,  our parliament has never shown enough strength to react to or  condemn such behavior by a member.    The case is already extremely bizarre. An open call for  terror and bloodshed by a deputy cannot go unpunished. Any  self-respecting parliament would have stripped a deputy of his  mandate for such a statement. I think that this time around  parliament has no right to remain silent.    As for the calumny directed against the Armenian foreign  minister--who does the orator have in mind? He has mentioned no  specific name. The previous foreign minister was also appointed  by the same authorities. In that case too the calumny would  have been as disgusting. Isagulyan must be brought before the  court. If he made his fiery revolutionary rhetoric in a  feverish moment or under the influence of alcohol or drugs or if  he is suffering psychological trouble -- his statement does  leave that impression -- this should represent extenuating  circumstances for Garnik Isgulyan, as long as this is confirmed  by an authorized medical group and made public.    Personally in such cases I try to persist despite my heavy  workload and regardless of the personal worth of the author of  calumny. If we aspire to a law-based state we must realize that  each of us must persist so that laws in the Republic can finally  take effect, Papazyan concluded.</p>

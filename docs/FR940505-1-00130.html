			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the numerical emission standards described above, EPA expects to propose to prohibit direct emissions of crankcase vapors into the atmosphere. Motor vehicles have been subject to an analogous requirement since the first stages of emission-control regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) General Enforcement Provisions. The Agency is expected to propose regulations that require marine sources to obtain certification and subject them to selective enforcement auditing and in-use enforcement. The Agency is also expected to propose regulations similar to those for on-highway vehicles under sections 203, 204, 205, and 208 of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Compliance Dates for Certification. The Federal marine program as it applies to the FIP areas will phase standards in over time. EPA proposes that emission standards become effective in the FIP areas beginning in the 1998 model year for outboard, sterndrive, and inboard SI marine engines, and in the 1999 model year for personal watercraft SI engines. Companies considered small marine businesses will be defined in the Federal rule and would first be subject to emission standards no earlier than the 2000 model year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Averaging, Banking, and Trading. Provisions of the national enforcement program are expected to include an averaging, banking, and trading Program. EPA will not propose an averaging, banking, and trading program for marine engines specifically for the FIP areas. However, EPA does plan on proposing such a program for the Federal regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Special FIP Measures.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency believes that the above Federal programs will have sound technical basis and will achieve projected emissions reductions. The Agency also acknowledges that the marine pleasure craft standards are likely to be technology forcing. However, the Agency also recognizes that many other sources, which have been previously regulated, will be required to meet new and more stringent standards than they are required to meet federally. For the purposes of equity and to achieve added emissions reductions from nonroad sources, the Agency proposes to and will take comment on a fees program for certain classes of these nonroad engines. The Agency is also proposing today a program to control emissions from engines used in recreational vehicles and nonroad and on-highway motorcycles as a special FIP measure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) On-Highway Motorcycles and Nonroad Engines Used in Nonroad Motorcycles. The Agency intends to exclude from its regulation of SI engines at or under 19 kW, engines used in recreational vehicles because they have fundamentally different operating characteristics than other small SI nonroad engines. In general, engines used in recreational equipment are similar to engines used in on-highway motorcycles in that they use a continuously variable throttle (not a governor), have rated engines speeds in excess of 5000 RPM, and wide variations in both engine load and speed. These engines, like motorcycle engines, are primarily used to transport people. CARB has estimated that engines used in nonroad vehicles such as motorcycles, all terrain vehicles, go-carts and other nonroad recreational vehicles, contribute 21 tons of HC and 100 tons of CO per day to the statewide inventory. Further, EPA estimates that on-highway motorcycles and engines used in nonroad motorcycles, including dirt bikes, ATVs, and similar equipment contribute 3, l, 30.3 tons of HC per day to the emissions inventories in the Sacramento, Ventura, and South Coast, respectively. To achieve reductions from this category of nonroad sources as well as to achieve reductions from on highway motorcycles and mopeds, EPA proposes to promulgate emissions restrictions for motorcycles and nonroad recreational vehicles similar to EPA's existing on-highway motorcycle program found in 40 CFR part 86 subpart E. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Overview. EPA today proposes to promulgate a definition of on-highway and nonroad motorcycles applicable in the State of California for the purposes of the FIP, as well as standards for those classes of motorcycles and engines used in them. Today's proposal encompasses on-highway motorcycles, and engines used in such vehicles as mopeds, dirt bikes, all terrain vehicles, and go-carts. EPA is also proposing a more stringent set of exhaust emission standards applicable to all new on-highway and nonroad motorcycles sold in the State of California after January 1, 1996. EPA proposes that all other requirements of the current Federal motorcycle regulations contained in 40 CFR part 86 subparts E and F, apply to motorcycles sold in California, including provisions for certification, test procedures, and enforcement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Definition of On-highway and Nonroad Motorcycles. For the purpose of the FIPs, EPA proposes to use the definition of motorcycle in 40 CFR part 86 to refer to on-highway motorcycles and add the following definition for nonroad motorcycles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A nonroad motorcycle means any motorized land vehicle designed for transporting persons or property and manufactured for sale, sold, offered for sale, introduced into commerce, or imported into the State of California and which has two wheels, or three or more wheels and a curb mass less than or equal to 680 kilograms; it does not include devices regulated by the State of California as other classes of motor vehicles or devices regulated by EPA as other classes of nonroad engines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

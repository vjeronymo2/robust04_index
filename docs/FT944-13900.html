			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Bosnia politicians call for removal of Rose: Relations between UN force chief and government at new low Relations between Bosnia's Moslem-led government and the United Nations plunged to a new low yesterday as Sarajevo politicians demanded the removal of General Sir Michael Rose, UN force commander. Bosnian officials and the UN also exchanged harsh words over the origin of an unprecedented fire-fight between government soldiers and French peacekeepers on the slopes of Mount Igman outside Sarajevo. Eight Bosnian political parties supported a demand that 'Rose must go' published in Sarajevo's daily newspaper, Oslobodenje. They accused the British commander, whose year-long tour of duty ends in January, of having 'done everything to water down the decisiveness of the free world in punishing crime and fascism'. He was more interested in protecting British interests than implementing UN resolutions, they claimed. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, sprang to Gen Rose's defence, expressing 'full confidence' in him and voicing 'gratitude' for his 'wonderful work'. UN spokesman Colonel Tim Spicer said Gen Rose was not concerned about the Bosnian criticism and there was no question of his leaving before his assignment ended. 'The job of a peacekeeper as opposed to a peace enforcer is a difficult path to walk and there is no question that Gen Rose has walked a central line in furtherance of the mission given to him.' The general's reputation among Sarajevo residents soared last February when his tough diplomacy helped end the siege of the city and restore relative normality to daily life. His standing sagged two months later when Moslems thought him too soft in responding to the Serb assault on the Gorazde enclave, and it fell further in August, when the UN failed to stop the Serbs from reimposing a partial blockade of Sarajevo. UN officials stress, however, that from the start his efforts to ensure a normal life for as many Bosnian civilians as possible have met with far from universal co-operation from Bosnian officials and generals. The February ceasefire in Sarajevo required some very tough talking to Bosnia's Moslem leaders as well as to the besieging Serbs. Two bursts of machine-gun fire raked a Sarajevo tram yesterday, wounding nine people, one of them seriously, Bosnian police and hospital officials told Reuter. 'It was the sower of death,' said a Bosnian policeman, referring to a heavy machine-gun with a distinctive sound much feared by residents because it is often loaded with exploding bullets. 'This was the worst single incident our hospital has handled since February,' a doctor said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter A. Portov] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok, 21 Dec -- High-ranking officers of the  Russian Pacific Fleet Command have said that the Russian Navy is  planning to resume dumping of radioactive liquids into the Sea  of Japan in late December or early January. The Russian  Government suspended the action after the last dumping, in  October, was severely criticized by Japan and other neighboring  nations.    However, the Pacific Fleet can no longer keep liquid waste  stored as it is on tanker ships because it was recently found to  have been leaking from an old tanker. According to the  officers, the next dumping is likely to be carried out in the  Sea of Japan and the waters off the Kamchatka Peninsula.    The officers said the Pacific Fleet held a meeting on 5  December in consultation with officials of the Maritime Kray  Government and the Russian Ministry of Ecology and Natural  Resources to discuss the treatment of radioactive waste. The  meeting reportedly discussed the possibility of purchasing new  waste tankers and of obtaining government financial support for  improving disposal facilities.    Nevertheless, they reached the conclusion that "resumption  of  dumping is inevitable" since there was no hope of immediate  financial support from the government.    Pacific Fleet Commander Guriynov is already back in  Vladivostok after his vacation in Moscow last week, and is  expected to decide exactly when the next dumping will be made  within this week. The officers believed said the most likely  date would be late in December or in early January.    According to an ITAR-TASS report on 20 December, a chief  negotiator of the Russian Pacific Fleet delegation at Danilyan  hinted at the resumption of dumping before Japan-Russia  negotiations on the radioactive waste problem, saying: "Russia  will have to continue dumping radioactive waste into the sea for  at least two years, even if Western nations help construction of  our nuclear waste disposal facilities. In fact, our dumping in  October was found harmless to the environment."    The high-ranking officers said Zvezda nuclear submarine dock  in Bolshoy-Kamen Bay, which is located halfway between  Vladivostok and Nakhodka, currently stores 2,700 cubic meters of  radioactive liquids. Of these, 1,000 cubic meters are stored in  the nuclear reactor of a submarine under repair, and the  remainder are stored in two tankers -- "TNT-5" (900 cubic  meters) and "TNT-27" (800 cubic meters). "TNT-5" is a  superannuated boat which was built in the 1970's. It has leaked  radioactive waste at least 14 times, and is no longer capable of  cruising. In fact, "TNT-5" is currently used as nothing more  than a floating tank. "TNT-27" is too old to undertake long  cruises, and is not considered safe enough to handle the storage  of radioactive liquids.    The high-ranking officers said the next dumping may be done  near Russian territorial waters in the Sea of Japan. When that  happens the liquid waste may well be sunk together with its  container, the "TNT-5." The officers noted it was usual in  Russia for solid and liquid waste to be sunk together with the  old tankers holding it.    The officers said that, in addition, Russia's biggest  submarine base in Kamchatka has 1,500 cubic meters of liquid  waste which the Navy will dump into waters off the Kamchatka  Peninsula in the near future.    Asked about the Japanese Government's reaction to reports of  Russian plans to resume dumping nuclear waste in the Sea of  Japan, Director Hiroshi Matsuoka of the Science and Technology  Agency's Disaster Prevention and Environment Policy Office said:  "It will be a big problem if the information is true. However,  we cannot comment on the report because it is not an official  statement by Russia conveyed by diplomatic channels."</p>

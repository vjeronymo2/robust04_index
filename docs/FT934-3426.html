			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Mahathir 'ready to defuse quarrel with Australia' Malaysia's premier, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, has hinted he is ready to defuse a row with Australia that has threatened diplomatic and trade links between the two countries. This follows a further attempt by Mr Paul Keating, Australian prime minister, to ease tensions, saying the Australian government wanted to 'work in harmony' with its Malaysian counterpart. But Mr Keating did not use the opportunity provided by a lecture on Australia-Asia relations to extend his limited apology to Dr Mahathir. Instead, he stressed that his description of Dr Mahathir as 'recalcitrant' because of the Malaysian leader's non-appearance at the recent Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in Seattle was not intended to cause offence. Mr Keating reiterated his regret that offence had been taken. Yesterday Dr Mahathir said he could accept Mr Keating's statement of regret over the remark but said it was up to the Malaysian cabinet to decide what action to take against Australia when it meets on Saturday. Some Malaysian ministers have called for a downgrading of diplomatic links and have said business contacts should be curtailed. Mr Gareth Evans, the Australian foreign minister, conceded that the affair had already caused commercial damage and could have more serious consequences. Malaysia's economy continues to expand strongly, with GDP growing 8.1 per cent in the third quarter. In the first nine months of 1993 Malaysia's economy grew 8.7 per cent.</p>

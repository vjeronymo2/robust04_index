Tennessee requests an effective date for the above-referenced sheets of October 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tennessee states that in the Fifth Tennessee Restructuring Order, the Commission denied Tennessee's request for rehearing regarding the crediting of revenues from Extended Receipt and Delivery Services because it felt that the services were essentially interruptible in nature. However, the Commission invited Tennessee to make a limited Section 4 filing to alter its Extended Receipt and Delivery Services in order to make them true firm services. The instant filing would require that shippers desiring Extended Receipt or Delivery Service reserve and pay for such capacity for at least three days. Thus Tennessee states that the proposed sheets comply with the Commission's holdings in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  65 FERC 61,130 (1993) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ANR Pipeline Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  64 FERC 61,140 (1993) as required by the Fifth Restructuring Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tennessee requests a waiver of the Commission's 30 day prior notice requirements in order that the proposed tariff sheets may go into effect on October 1, 1994. Implementation at this time will allow Tennessee to gain experience in scheduling the new Extended Receipt and Delivery Service prior to increased system demands that will result from colder weather. While Tennessee does not believe any additional waivers are necessary, Tennessee respectfully requests that the Commission grant any waivers it deems necessary for acceptance of this filing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tennessee states that copies of the filing have been mailed to all of its jurisdictional customers and affected state regulatory commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said filing should file a petition to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Sections 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214. All such petitions or protests should be filed on or before September 20, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to this proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a petition to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file and available for public inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

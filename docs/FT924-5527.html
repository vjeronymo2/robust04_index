			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Market-testing YESTERDAY'S announcement that more than 44,000 jobs in the UK civil service are to be put out to tender is good news for companies that are well-placed to bid for the contracts. In a recession where spotting green shoots requires keen eyesight, the prospect of almost Pounds 1.5bn of new business in the next 10 months is welcome. But it is also good news for the taxpayer, who can expect significant savings in public expenditure - and better quality public services to boot. Contracting out local government services such as street cleaning and refuse collection is now well established and widely accepted as a discipline for ensuring value for money. In most cases, the contract is awarded to the council workforce - only one in five contracts ends up in the hands of private contractors. But even where the work stays in-house, the threat of losing it is persuasive in improving the efficiency and quality of services. Such benefits will now be enjoyed in central government, so far largely immune to competition from the private sector. The government believes that the discipline of the market will save 25 per cent of the cost of the services involved. This is almost certainly over-optimistic - in local government, savings rarely exceed 20 per cent. But market-testing will exert downward pressure on costs, most welcome as public expenditure continues to climb. Bringing market pressures to bear on central government is about much more than shaving costs, however. The extension of contracting out widely throughout government services is a significant element in the prime minister's drive to improve their quality through the Citizen's Charter. It is part of the move away from providing central government services through a homogenous civil service, a large bureaucratic machine designed to administer rather than manage, where policymaking skills are more important than management ability. Instead, the emphasis is increasingly on government by contract: public services will be provided by specialist organisations, to clearly defined standards which are set out in contractual agreements. Those organisations may be companies in the private sector, executive agencies, management buy-outs or the current staff reorganised on more business-like lines. But the separation of purchaser and provider through the medium of a contract for services allows a much stronger focus on the quality of service, as the experience of the health service shows. Drawing up the list of targets - and persuading departments to be creative in adding activities to it - is only half the battle, however. Managing the process of market-testing requires skills with which the civil service has not always shown itself well-equipped. It will work well only if specifications for contracts are comprehensive and the assessment of bids competent. Choosing the lowest bid is often not the wisest course, especially if the emphasis is as much on quality as cost. While the market-testing programme offers a good start towards government by contract, it will need careful nurturing if it is to yield the potential benefits.</p>

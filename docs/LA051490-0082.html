			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWPORT BEACH TENNIS;  </P> <P> KRONEMANN, LUBNER LOSE TO PROS IN FINAL  </P> <P> Tim Pawsat flew to Rome immediately after the Children's Hospital of Orange  County tennis tournament final Sunday to play in the Italian Open.  </P> <P> Robert Van't Hof has an exhibition match at La Costa this weekend, a TeamTennis  promotion in Sacramento the following week, then he's off to England for a  tournament.  </P> <P> Someday soon it will be that way for UC Irvine seniors Trevor Kronemann and  Richard Lubner. Both will turn pro after playing in the NCAA tournament, which  begins Friday in Indian Wells.  </P> <P> There was no mistaking the pros for the pros-in-waiting Sunday at the John  Wayne Tennis Club. Pawsat and Van't Hof defeated Kronemann and Lubner, 6-4,  6-4, winning $1,100 each.  </P> <P> Kronemann wasn't sure what he would have done with the prize money if he and  Lubner had won. Accepting it would have made them ineligible for the NCAA  tournament.  </P> <P> "We probably would have left it and had them (tournament officials) give it to  charity," Kronemann said. "I'm really ready to get out on the pro tour. There  will be plenty of paydays like that someday."  </P> <P> Until then, Kronemann and Lubner will concentrate on preparing for West  Virginia, Irvine's first-round opponent Friday.  </P> <P> To that end, Kronemann called Sunday's loss a learning experience.  </P> <P> "It's great to come out and play these guys," he said. "It's a great warm-up  for the NCAAs."  </P> <P> It was a loss, nevertheless.  </P> <P> Pawsat and Van't Hof served a little better and even managed to slow Kronemann,  known as much for his girth (6 feet 3, 228 pounds) as for his hard-hit volleys.  </P> <P> Lubner hit his share of blistering shots at Pawsat and Van't Hof, but never  seemed to get the same crowd reaction that Kronemann received on his powerful  winners.  </P> <P> Perhaps it is his size, but Kronemann always seems to capture the fans' fancy  wherever he plays.  </P> <P> Two key service breaks helped Pawsat and Van't Hof overcome Kronemann and  Lubner.  </P> <P> The first break gave them a 5-4 lead in the first set. Van't Hof then held  serve to win the set. The second gave them a 4-3 lead in the second set.  </P> <P> Van't Hof then held serve again, but it wasn't easy. The game went to deuce six  times before Pawsat and Van't Hof won.  </P> <P> "If we lose that game we might lose the match," Van't Hof said. "We really had  to dig down."  </P> <P> Pawsat held serve and the old guard held on for the victory.  </P> <P> Kathy May Paben and Stephanie Rehe won the women's final, 6-1, 6-4, over  Barbara Lemberg and Sandy Collins.  </P> <P> For Paben and Rehe, the final was a breeze compared to their hard-fought 6-3,  6-7, 6-3 victory over Linda Howell and Cynthia MacGregor in the semifinals  Saturday.  </P> <P> Chris Dunk and Sandy Collins won the mixed doubles title, 7-5, 6-7, 6-1, over  Phil and Betty Ann Dent.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NRC OKS N.H. A-PLANT SAFETY PLAN  </P> <P> A Nuclear Regulatory Commission panel has conditionally approved the New  Hampshire part of the emergency plan for the Seabrook nuclear power plant,  saying it does not believe area teachers' claims that they would abandon their  pupils in an atomic emergency.  </P> <P> In a 290-page decision dated Friday and released today, a panel of three  administrative law judges said there is "reasonable assurance that adequate  protective measures can and will be taken within the New Hampshire portion" of  a 10-mile evacuation zone around the plant.  </P> <P> Part of the zone lies in Massachusetts, which has to cooperate in the planning  for an evacuation.  </P> <P> The plant's operator, Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, has submitted a plan  for Massachusetts communities, but the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board panel  of law judges has yet to hold a hearing on it.  </P></p>

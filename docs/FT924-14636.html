			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / UK tabloids biased says report THE COVERAGE of Japan in many British national newspapers is negative and biased with a heavy concentration on whale hunting, war atrocity and 'funny Jap' stories, according to a new study published in the UK. The fiercely competitive mass-market tabloids, with the exception of the Daily Mirror, use 'viciousness, vacuity and sheer negative spitefulness in their treatment of items on Japan' said the report sponsored by Andersen Consulting, the management consultancy arm of UK auditors Arthur Andersen. The survey by Professor Douglas Anthony, professor of Japanese studies at Cardiff University, was based on a study of the national and regional press from January to June 1991. Prof Anthony said that the Daily Mirror was less culpable than The Sun or the Daily Star. The amount of Japanese coverage in the broadsheet papers was much greater than in the tabloids but Japan was still given less attention than its size merited. The Financial Times had the most articles on Japan in the period - 639. The study says such a high proportion of the FT's coverage was neutral it was not worth making a full breakdown.</p>

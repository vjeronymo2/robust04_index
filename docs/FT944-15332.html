			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Taming the dragon for an uncertain future: How structural changes to the Welsh Development Agency aim to improve its reputation At London's Paddington station a huge illuminated sign tells departing travellers: 'Wales gets your business on the right track. For successful business, contact the Welsh Development Agency - the Welsh Advantage.' That advantage has been put in doubt. Criticism by the Commons public accounts committee last year caused it to become one of the most notorious of UK quangos. Since then the WDA's management has been replaced and its structure reorganised. But politically its future is at stake. In a few days' time its corporate plan will be discussed with Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary. This week Mr Rhodri Morgan, the Labour MP for Cardiff West who acted as the WDA whistle-blower, is tabling Commons questions to Mr Redwood asking what consultation is taking place. He said: 'The WDA is fighting for its life, mostly against Mr Redwood's inability to accept there can be such a thing as beneficial intervention in a market economy by a state agency. He wants it shrunk to a core operation.' The Welsh Office, embarrassed by its hands-off supervision which failed to check the malpractices, appears anxious to show it has tamed the dragon. The agency will, for example, be allowed less say in forming regional development policy. But asked about the WDA's survival, Mr Redwood was adamant. 'I have been crystal clear: the agency is remaining and there are no proposals to remove it,' he said. 'I have given it a very clear set of tasks which I want it to excel in. They have no reason to worry on my score.' Its first task, he said, was to promote inward investment. Secondly, the WDA was to assist with urban regeneration schemes 'and not to dominate or go against local plans. I look to local authorities for vision and leadership'. Its third main role was to continue its programme of land reclamation. This suggests a significant redirection. In the past the WDA took the lead in joint ventures. Councils, being accountable to the electorate, will now take charge. In addition the agency's role as an industrial property developer is largely over. Mr Redwood said there were 'an awful lot of empty factories out there' and the WDA would seek to sell about Pounds 180m worth of land and property in the next two years. Once the sell-off is complete, the funding shortfall will have to be met either by an increased grant or by a reduction in the agency's programmes. At present government grant provides 46 per cent of the Pounds 161m budget. In future the WDA faces a much tougher fight to secure funding against competing claims for taxpayers' money. The overall implication is the WDA will become more modest. The old agency was symbolised by its headquarters in Cardiff's Pearl House, a gaunt tower dominating the city's skyline. This autumn more than half the staff have been made redundant or been relocated to a new regional structure, intended to devolve responsibility and bring the agency closer to its clients. Before long the WDA will quit Pearl House for a less imposing location. Staffing has been cut from 420 to 350 and nearly all the previous senior management has departed - notably Dr Gwyn Jones, the former chairman, and Mr Philip Head, chief executive. Dr Jones performed a high-profile double-act with Mr Redwood's predecessors, Mr Peter Walker (now Lord Walker) and Mr David Hunt (now employment secretary). But an inquiry headed by Sir John Caines, after the public accounts committee report, concluded: 'Good staff management was sacrificed to the attainment of results.' The new team of Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, chairman, and Mr Barry Hartop, chief executive, has recruited most of their top executives externally. Mr Hartop said: 'We have a fundamental change in management, style, culture, approach and values. We believe the role of this place is to promote Wales and not the WDA. That is a rather large change from the way things were run previously.' In Mr Rowe-Beddoe's words: 'We recognise that we have the eyes of Wales upon us.' Although an imminent report into an Aberdare development will disclose another example of previous dubious conduct, systems have been introduced to try to prevent future scandals. A confidential hotline to the legal director has been installed - previously, staff were too frightened of losing their jobs to raise any doubts. Mr Hartop said: 'We now have compliance reviews and have just issued a code of practice. I'm feeling more and more comfortable that we're conducting this agency in an appropriate manner for the expenditure of public funds.' The board - criticised by one former executive as having been 'supine' - has new members and is more active. Mr Hartop said the guiding principles were to push power to the new divisions and be demand-led. The private sector would be involved far more. In particular, he believed it was right to encourage the private sector to take over much of the WDA's property functions. He said: 'We have looked at our property and decided on the level of what I will call our working capital - what we need to satisfy the needs of inward investors and indigenous businesses. We should not be a major landholder.' The new management, which has not been immune from controversy, has yet to rebuild staff morale. For example, Mr Rowe-Beddoe last April became a director of Development Securities, a property company. But the perceived threat to the agency has rallied support for it across a spectrum of Welsh opinion. Professor Kevin Morgan, of the University of Wales and author of a recent report on the WDA, says that Mr Redwood, by being disinclined to support a public-sector body, has precipitated a crisis. 'There is growing political polarisation over the agency's role, when what is needed is greater consensus,' he said. While Labour urges greater accountability of quangos - saying that the Conservatives use them to bypass their low electoral success in Wales - it defends the WDA, which the party set up when in government 18 years ago. Mr Rhodri Morgan said: 'We have always distinguished between the excessively freebooting style of the previous regime and our support for the agency itself, which should not be shrunk in importance. It remains the engineroom of the Welsh economy.' Mr Hartop, himself a businessman from the private sector, is convinced Wales still needs a development agency. In spite of achievements in restructuring the economy, gross domestic product remains below the UK average. 'Clearly there are areas which require public support in order to get economic regeneration,' he said. 'But we are cognizant that we have to get more private-sector cash, because that in the long term is what will regenerate Wales.'</p>

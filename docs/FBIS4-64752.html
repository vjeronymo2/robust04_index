			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Welt-Nachrichtendienst" report: "Lufthansa To Be </F> Privatized"]    [Text] Bonn -- The Federal Government and Lufthansa have  agreed on how the pension claims of the employees are to be  protected when the corporation is privatized. This cleared the  last obstacle for a rights issue and the withdrawal of the  government from the airline.    The Federal Government currently holds 51.4 percent of  Lufthansa. If the government does not participate in the rights  issue, its holding will fall below 50 percent. As a result, the  corporation falls out of the government and laender (VBL)  pension plan, where Lufthansa employees currently have their  pension insurance.    The agreement envisages that the VBL will continue to pay  the  pensions of Lufthansa's current 5,500 retirees. For that  purpose, the government will pay about 1 billion marks [DM] in  15 annual installments. For the active employees, currently  numbering about 50,000, Lufthansa will found a company pension  fund, into which the government will pay DM500 million over 10  years. The trade unions have still to agree to this settlement.    Board of Governors Chairman Wolfgang Roeller announced a  speedy capital increase of "more than DM1 billion."</p>

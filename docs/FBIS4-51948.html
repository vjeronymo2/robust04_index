			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh at </F> the opening of the International Press Freedom Day in Phnom Penh  on 3 May -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The first question is about a  cease-fire and a roundtable. As all of you, ladies and  gentlemen, have already been aware, after the audience, His  Majesty met with both of us [Ranariddh and Hun Sen] and proposed  to the royal government the cease-fire, a standstill, and the  meeting with the Khmer Rouge at a roundtable. As you know, we  already answered His Majesty when we saw him -- not just at this  point in time -- that we are pleased to accept his proposal. In  sum, the royal government is prepared to declare that it accepts  an unconditional cease-fire, the standstill, and the proposal to  set up a cease-fire observation committee with two generals  representing the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF] and two others  representing the Khmer Rouge group [words indistinct]. We are  always ready to participate in the roundtable meeting under His  Majesty's chairmanship if the cease- fire becomes secure. His  Majesty said the table would not be rectangular; it would  definitely be round. This is to relieve His Excellency [H.E.]  Khieu Samphan's anxiety about the problem of parity.    Besides, why did we inform His Majesty that we would not go  to Jakarta or Paris? Because, as the king has said, if we (?are  just brought to perform at the circus), the problem will not  end. We have our national pride and prestige after the general  elections organized by the United Nations. Our fellow  countrymen, estimated to be about 89.7 percent of the total  voters, overcame all manner of obstacles to cast their vote.  This is evidence of their love for liberal democracy. As we  have a Constitution, a fully independent and sovereign kingdom,  a national assembly, a king, a royal government, and a country,  we must talk to settle Cambodia's problems. Now the Khmer Rouge  issue is a Cambodian problem, so it should be discussed in  Cambodia. Moreover, we have a king. As the Constitution has  clearly specified, although he has not yet become our Cambodian  nation's parent, the king has a great mission to reconcile and  unify the nation. So the king cannot go to other places except  for our country. That being the case, the royal government has  proposed that if there is a roundtable, the roundtable should  take place in the Kingdom of Cambodia. Moreover, the Royal  Palace belongs to His Majesty, who is regarded by all Cambodians  as their own parent endowed with a neutral attribute. Does the  Khmer Rouge group consider the king as a nonneutral person and  the royal palace a nonneutral place? This is the position of  the royal government.    Besides, we should also clarify that it was I who kept  talking and staying with the Khmer Rouge. It was only after the  1993 elections that I crossed to this side. Therefore, we  already held a lot of rounds of talks, signed the [Paris] 23  October 1991 accord, and participated in the elections. The  Khmer Rouge group had ample opportunity to return to the  national community. I do believe that now it is not yet late.  The Khmer Rouge, like the kingdom and the royal government,  must provide an immediate answer to the most correct proposal,  which takes into account the people's aspiration for peace and  which considers the royal palace as a neutral base for national  reconciliation. This is the message I ask the national and  international radios to help convey to H.E. Khieu Samphan.  [applause]    As you know, I, Ranariddh, have been despised for several  months. The Khmer Rouge continues to call me the FUNCINPEC  [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful,  and Cooperative Cambodia] chairman, and now it has gone so far  as to call me a French or American lackey or a mad dog. A  Cambodian newspaper has even said that I have secretly met with  the Khmer Rouge -- Ranariddh has no secret contacts; samdech  prime minister [Hun Sen] has always been aware of those  meetings. Because they do not want to come, I accept to act as  a dog for the sake of peace. As I secretly met with the Khmer  Rouge in Bangkok, some said that Ranariddh did not care about  the government's fame and honor. I was willing to see him  [Khieu Samphan] and talk with the hope that we were able to put  an end to Cambodia's bloodshed. In light of what you  [journalists] reported to the king yesterday, it can be  understood that it is the royal government -- with the Khmer  Rouge refusing to participate in the elections, accept the  Constitution, recognize the National Assembly, lay down arms,  and hold talks -- which wants to wage war. This is because the  government is responsible for the war, which has dragged on in  our Cambodian Kingdom.    No one else is better than I am. What more should I do?  Some people may say: Look! After the fall of Anlung Veng and  Pailin, now he is ready to negotiate a cease-fire.  Nevertheless, the national and international media have not  paid attention to what I have said. I met with Khieu Samphan  before the events of Phnum Malai, Anlung Veng, Pailin, and so  on. I asked him to declare a cease-fire. We were ready to talk  at a round or rectangular table, but a cease-fire should be  declared first. This is to establish an acceptable and  appropriate basis for the talks. Therefore, it is not just now  that we want to talk. I wish to clarify this again.    However, Khieu Samphan's only answer was: We cannot cease  firing, and Your Highness Ranariddh should understand that the  Vietnamese are attacking the patriots. I then said: If you say  that, there is nothing left that we can negotiate. I went to  talk about the Cambodian problems, but in his answers, H.E.  Khieu Samphan said the Vietnamese were attacking and that the  Vietnamese were preparing the 14th dry-season offensive. In  1993, he still insisted that there was a 14th dry-season  offensive. This means that talks, the elections, and the  signing in Paris are all meaningless.    In sum, today we do not mean to whitewash ourselves. We  still want to end the bloody war because our neighbors, as His  Majesty has said, are extremely happy to see us continue to  expose one another ceaselessly -- the Cambodians have a bad  habit of asking for help from others when they are bickering  among themselves. This is what the neighbors want us to do, and  this is what we have continued to do so far. For 23 years, we  have never wanted to stop or repent of what we have committed.    The royal government wishes to repeatedly state that it is  ready to go to not only the Royal Palace but also Pyongyang.  This is because Pyongyang is His Majesty's royal palace,  Pyongyang is a parcel of Cambodian land. Before they were  barred from staying in the Royal Palace, but now they can stay  there as they please. The reason that we did not allow H.E.  Khieu Samphan to stay in the Royal Palace was that we were of  the opinion that His Majesty is the Cambodian people's own  parent and a neutral person and that the Royal Palace is a  neutral zone. So the conflicting parties should stay away from  the neutral place. However, he disagrees. Now we have agreed  to let him stay in the Royal Palace if he wishes. However, his  answer is that Phnom Penh, Cambodia are not the neutral zones.  Anyway, we are ready to go to Pyongyang, but we can in no way  allow our sacred king (?to be used by them on stage again). We  ask that the Cambodian people should not be used as monkeys at  (?a circus). I really don't know what more to do.    National and international media have regarded Pailin,  Anlung  Veng as something gigantic. I also listened to France-Inter  Radio. When the KRAF captured Pailin, the radio said nothing  about that. However, when the Khmer Rouge retook Pailin, it  reported about it every hour. There were also interviews with  experts on Cambodian affairs. I would like you to ponder a bit.  The Khmer Rouge occupied Pailin since 1989. The former State  of Cambodia, although it made a great deal of effort, did not  try to retake Pailin. This was due to the negotiations.  Afterward, even H.E. Akashi [UN Transitional Authority in  Cambodia chief] was not able to enter Pailin, but the KRAF could  do so. I do not want to raise the circumstances under which the  KRAF were obliged to retreat.    I would like to ask you to be even-handed in the treatment  of  the issue. Could you just refrain from saying that the KRAF are  defeated everywhere? Somehow, now can they do business in  Pailin?    I have seen no paper reporting about the Khmer Rouge's  destruction of our Cambodia's national environment, future, and  natural resources in Pailin. Has anybody talked about the Khmer  Rouge's giving foreigners a free hand to commit the destruction  that constitutes the most heavy burden for our nation's future?  Has anybody talked about the royal government's duty as  stipulated in the Constitution's Article 3, saying that no group  can divide Cambodia? Has anyone ever talked about this? Blame  is always placed upon the government.    I come here just to beg and clarify. It it true that we have  retreated from Anlung Veng, but Ta Mok has felled hundreds of  thousand cubic meters of trees and sold them to a country,  namely Thailand. The government does not want to win, but it  does not want to lose, either. The government is prepared to  talk, cease firing, and implement a standstill. It is also  prepared to send two generals [to take part in the cease-fire  observation committee] and participate in talks under the  correct and lofty chairmanship of His Majesty, our sacred king.  Is it like that? [Ranariddh asks Hun Sen] We are two, so from  time to time we should ask each other for additional advice. In  my capacity as the first prime minister, I think my  clarification about the cease-fire that some of you raised with  His Majesty is enough. [passage omitted]</p>

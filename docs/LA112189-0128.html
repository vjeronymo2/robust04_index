			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LIGHT OF FREEDOM  </P> <P> Thanksgiving has a special place in the hearts of all Americans when we  recognize the many blessings that we have in this nation.  </P> <P> But this Thanksgiving is different and more meaningful as we watch so many  people in Eastern Europe and parts of the Soviet Union who, for the first time  in their lives, are seeing the light of freedom. To observe the joy on their  faces is truly a great moment in world history and reminds us of the struggle  that we had as a young nation to obtain liberty.  </P> <P> Out of this struggle came the U.S. Constitution. We are fortunate to celebrate  its bicentennial, with emphasis, which started this fall, on the Bill of  Rights. This Thanksgiving should be glorious, indeed.  </P> <P> LYNN S. TURNER  </P> <P> Chair, Newport Beach  </P> <P> Bicentennial of the  </P> <P> U.S. Constitution Committee  </P></p>

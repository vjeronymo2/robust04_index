			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Property: Terrifying fete for would-be squires - The hidden burden of responsibility that awaits purchasers of English village manors EVEN THOUGH Sarah Evans and her husband had not yet moved in to the big house they had bought in a Norfolk village, she found herself opening the fete. 'You must do your bit and get involved,' she said, altough she was surprised that the chairman of the parish council was so quick to ask. 'I was terrified, but it gave everybody a chance to see who we are.' At the end of the season of fetes, sponsored rides, clay-pigeon shoots, tennis tournaments, and gardens open to the public, who would want to be the village squire? What are the pluses and minuses of being Mr and Mrs Bighouse? To the rest of the village the pluses are obvious, and hallowed by custom. Anyone who chooses to live in the manor is thought willing to take on its duties - regardless of the hassles. When Lt Col Peter Lewis, was looking for a house in Dorset. He was quite clear he did not want to be a village squire 'We had plenty of all that running a regiment. But I've no doubt there are people who do want it.' He plumped for an old rectory, not the manor. Inheriting a house in Oxfordshire, Laura Sharp was advised to draw all curtains and lock every door bar one on fete day, so that thieves could not case the place while mixing with the crowds in the garden. 'I was appalled. But I got some transparent curtains which didn't look too obvious.' Theft is the big hazard for those who open their gardens. The visitors paying to help the retired district nurses can return in a few days to collect the garden urns. Or they may have made off already with illicit cuttings hidden in their umbrellas, justifying it to themselves with the excuse that they are extending our great horticultural heritage. Horse and tennis events are easier. For these, the Bighouses do not need to be their own security guards, but they must have the officer qualities to run a one-day Wimbledon on an endless supply of squash and hot dogs, with St John's Ambulance standing by. Nor do duties stop in the winter. 'A bridge evening perhaps?' the Parochial Church Council will suggest. Or a concert for the fabric fund. Or a supper for the Tories, Pounds 4.50 a head, cash bar, and incomplete without a few words from the Member. (It is sound practice to have him say them before the food. That keeps them shorter.) Requests for money are year-round. Surely, the Bighouses will support the prize draw for the village hall, Poppy Day, the Red Cross, the church flower fund, the homeless and hungry, and sponsor swims for the hospice? The church will be the keenest to tap the Bighouses cheque book. The parson knows there is a limit to what he can ask yet again of his tiny congregation. A large covenant from the Bighouses would answer his prayers. He will assume they are Anglicans - until they come out as agnostics or Romans. How do the new owners see it? Since Laura Sharp's inheritance includes the village cricket field and allotments, she has a role that may ruffle many feathers. 'I must be positive,' she says, 'and think of the whole village and not just of myself or any one village organisation. We are lucky that the new motorway hardly touches us yet.' That means not rushing to change parts of village life which, once altered, can never be replaced. She has no qualms about the hunt crossing her land, but is still uncertain how she views the weed-killer the tenant farmer sprays. And lunatic, out-of-date rumours about housing development rush round the village as fast as a pint is sunk in the pub. 'But anybody not a recluse in the big house is open to rumours,' she says briskly. 'Perhaps one should give them something dramatic to talk about.' For the Bighouses arriving at the manor, the key is joining in, but not aggressively. Those in similar houses in the other villages will then welcome them. And they will be known quickly around their village, though they cannot hope to be accepted for at least a decade. Fresh in many villager's mind is what happened in the 1980s, when new owners moved on quickly, having made a killing from selling the kitchen-garden and stables for conversion to housing. Laura Sharp has the last word. 'If you're in the big house, I think you should give something back.' If you do, and stick at it, the village will eventually come to see that the only time you are going is when you are carried out. In rural England that is seriously good news.'</p>

Chernyakov under the </F> ``Antenna and Waveguide Technology and Wave Propagation''  rubric; received after rework Nov.18,1991; UDC 621.396.96]    [Abstract] Discrete control of phased antenna arrays (PAAs)  causes additional errors in setting the angular position of a  beam. In some cases discreteness errors considerably limit the  accuracy of angular measurements. The objective of the work was  to synthesize an aperture algorithm for calculating phase  distributions (FDs) of PAAs with discrete phasing that do not  have the drawbacks of other known methods for reducing the total  error. The proposed algorithm for calculating phase distribution  of a two-dimensional PAA of N x N elements with discrete phasing  makes it possible to compensate for errors of discrete direction  of a PAA. In terms of the accuracy beam guidance the algorithm  is equivalent to averaging the directivity diagram by isophase  supports. It makes it possible to reduce the angular error of  beam setting with low aperture expenditures and high speed of  the FD computer. Figures 2, tables 2, references 2.</p>

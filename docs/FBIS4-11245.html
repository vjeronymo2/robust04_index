			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Carlos Subero] </F>   [Text] The results of the December 1993 elections placed  nearly every state government in a situation of instability. The  initial consequences have already been seen in the States of  Amazonas and Anzoategui, where the recently installed  legislatures have rejected the governor's annual report by a  two-thirds majority.    There are two reasons why this trend is being seen right  now.  The first is the multiparty coalitions that emerged in most  states, where the voters switched from the two-party balance  that had prevailed until recently. As a result, in several  states the governors ended up without enough executive political  clout to block the rejection of the annual report they are  supposed to submit to the representative body of their state for  consideration.    But the other reason is that the regional legislators  elected  in 1988 were in office for five years, until 1993, while the  governors were elected in 1992, a year earlier, when a different  balance of power prevailed. The mistake, which the State Public  Office Term Act failed to correct, occurred in 1988, when  Congress approved the popular election of governors but did not  change the law so that the regional legislatures that would  control these leaders could be elected at the same time. The  instability created by this factor will end in 1995, however,  when elections for both levels will be held on the same day.    In 12 states, it is the balance of power that has caused the  instability of the popularly elected government, because it is a  minority government. These states are Amazonas, Anzoategui,  Aragua, Carabobo, Falcon, Guarico, Lara, Merida, Miranda,  Portuguesa, Sucre, and Zulia.    There are four other cases in which the instability is a  result of the governor's inability to marshal the support of all  the legislators who would normally be allied with him. It is  common for a few ruling-party deputies to jump ship, which  undermines the governor's political base in the legislature.    Right now the governors elected in 1992 are submitting their  first annual reports. If a two-thirds majority votes to reject  the report, the governor is automatically removed from office,  and new elections are called. Although the same thing may happen  next year with their second report of the three-year term,  however, a rejection by a two-thirds majority will not result in  new elections being called, but the legislature will appoint  someone to finish out the term.    The minority governors can negotiate to remain in office,  and  in other cases, the opposition itself could be ejected because  the governor is extremely popular and might run again in the new  elections.    Here is the current situation in each state:  <H5>  Amazonas </H5>   The assembly has just voted Governor Edgar Sayago out of  office with seven out of 11 votes, the four deputies of  Democratic Action (AD) having joined together with the three  deputies of the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS). Sayago had the  support of the three deputies of the Social Christian Party  (Copei) and Convergence's one deputy. It was decided that seven  votes constituted two-thirds of the legislature.    A lot of political shifting has taken place in this state.  Sayago used to be a member of AD until 1992, when he was  expelled. He ran as a MAS candidate, and won the governorship in  a coalition with Unity for Advancement (UPA) and ORA [expansion  not given]. But then he lost MAS's support and won over Copei,  and more recently Convergence.    The elections to decide who will be governor are set for 24  April.  <H5>  Anzoategui </H5>   This is another state where the annual report has been  rejected by a two-thirds majority. Governor Ovidio Gonzalez was  reelected in December 1992 with 51.70 percent of the valid votes  in a self-described "ethical alliance" of 17 political groups,  headed by Copei, MAS, the People's Electoral Movement (MEP), and  ORA.    The balance of power in the legislative assembly was changed  by the 1993 elections, resulting in the instability that has  brought down Gonzalez's government. There are 19 deputies  altogether, with six for AD, six for Cause R, four for Copei,  two for Convergence, and one for MAS, the latter being the only  one who voted in favor of the annual report.  <H5>  Apure </H5>   The governor is Marcelo Oquendo (AD), elected with 53.24  percent of the vote in December 1992. AD has seven of the 13  members of the assembly, which would allow it to block the  formation of a two-thirds majority of nine regional legislators.  Copei has five, Convergence one.    Nevertheless, problems could arise here because Governor  Oquendo has disagreements with the party's local chapter, which  took him to the disciplinary tribunal recently. The instability  has resulted from these problems.  <H5>  Aragua </H5>   Carlos Tablante has been governor since 1989, having been  reelected in 1992 with 62.73 percent of the vote. There are  instability problems because the new balance of political power  in the legislature means that the governor has to depend on the  support of the MAS-Convergence axis.    There are 21 deputies, of which six represent MAS and three  Convergence. These nine deputies can block a two-thirds majority  vote to reject the annual report, which requires 14 votes. Cause  R has six deputies, AD three, and Copei three, adding up to 12  opposition votes, not enough to muster the majority vote needed  to bring about the immediate removal of the governor.    It should be noted that Tablante was a minority governor  when  he took office in 1989. But by entering into personal agreements  with deputies who had deserted AD and Copei, he managed to forge  a solid base of support that enabled him to govern without  legislative hindrance.  <H5>  Barinas </H5>   Problems arose here in the 1989 election, causing repeat  elections to be held in May 1993. Gehard Cartay is governor,  having won 52 percent of the vote in an alliance headed by Copei  and MAS. The new balance of power, in which Copei has five of  the 13 legislative votes, gives him a certain margin of safety.  His government has encountered a variety of problems, but Cartay  has very good relations with President Caldera. AD has five  deputies in the legislature, and the other three belong to  Convergence, MAS, and Cause R, with one each.  <H5>  Bolivar </H5>   Andres Velasquez (Cause R) was elected in December 1992 to  serve his last term as governor of this state with 63 percent of  the valid votes for his party. Cause R has 12 of the 19 deputies  in the legislature, which assures it of approval of the annual  report. During his last term he was a minority governor, but  although AD and Copei voted against his annual report, they did  not have enough votes for the two-thirds majority necessary to  force new elections. Now Velasquez enjoys strong support in the  legislature. AD has four of the 19 seats, Copei two, and MAS one.  <H5>  Carabobo </H5>   Henrique Salas Romer was reelected in December 1992 with 73  percent of the vote in an alliance headed by Copei and MAS. Last  December's elections, however, changed the balance of power in  the legislature compared to the 1988 elections.    In this state, as in almost all the others in the central  part of the country, AD and Copei lost power to Cause R, MAS and  Convergence. AD and Copei now have only three deputies each,  accounting for six of the 22. The other deputies belong to Cause  R (eight), Convergence (four), and MAS (four). A two-thirds  majority requires 15 votes, and can be blocked with eight votes.    Governor Salas Romer, a politician whom President Caldera  regards very highly, has good relations with Convergence. He did  not take a stand in favor of the Copei candidate during the  election campaign, in contrast to Ovidio Gonzalez, who not only  favored the Copei candidate but also attacked Caldera's  candidacy. Despite Copei's fall in Carabobo, one good sign for  Governor Salas is the fact that in the only district where Copei  won, the candidate was his son.    There were problems with the installation of the legislature  in this state, and ultimately the executive board of the  legislature ended up in the hands of Cause R and AD. The  governor's stability will depend on his skill in negotiating  with Convergence and neutralizing AD. In this state, most of the  party votes went to Cause R.  <H5>  Cojedes </H5>   Governor Jose Felipe Machado won in 1992 with 44 percent of  the vote, basically the vote garnered by his party, Copei. This  government is somewhat stable, since Copei won the state  elections in December. Six of the 12 seats in the legislature  are held by Copei, four by AD, and one each by Convergence and  Cause R. It takes eight votes to get a two-thirds majority,  which can be blocked with five votes.  <H5>  Delta Amacuro </H5>   Partial elections have already been called in this state for  10 April to decide who was elected governor on 6 December 1992,  given that the Supreme Court of Justice has annulled a group of  official vote tallies.    In this case, the new legislative assembly elected on 5  December 1993 has nothing to do with the instability; it was  caused by irregularities in the 1992 elections.    The balance of power in the legislature of this new state  involves minority factions of AD, Copei, MAS, and Convergence.  The Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) decided to call elections,  but it left in power Governor Emery Mata Millan, whose election  has been called into question. Mr. Mata Millan was elected with  the support of Copei, which has only three deputies in the  11-member legislature; but he has another group, MERI [expansion  not given], with two deputies. MAS, whose leader, Armando  Salazar, has gubernatorial aspirations, also has only three  deputies. AD, Cause R, and Convergence have one deputy each.  <H5>  Falcon </H5>   Another state whose government was left in a difficult  position, without sufficient support in the legislature, is  Falcon, where Aldo Cermeno has been governor since 1989. He was  reelected in 1992 with 51 percent of the vote in an alliance  involving Copei, MAS, and other groups. MAS has already  abandoned him, and with the results of last December's  elections, the balance of power in the legislature has left him  in a precarious position.    Copei ended up with five of the 15 deputy seats. But the  other 10, which constitute a two-thirds majority, are against  it: Convergence with five, AD with four, and Cause R with one.  Aldo Cermeno is on notice that he may be the next governor whose  annual report is challenged.  <H5>  Guarico </H5>   Governor Jose Malave Risso, Copei's 1992 candidate, won with  45.25 percent of the vote. Copei, however, won only three of the  15 seats in the legislature elected last December, leaving its  governor without sufficient backing in the state's legislative  body. He is another governor who may soon be ousted by a  two-thirds majority vote rejecting his report.    AD controls the assembly with eight votes, Cause R has two,  and MAS and Convergence have one each. Malave Risso became  Guarico's governor with Caldera's backing in 1992, but later he  publicly supported Alvarez Paz. Even if he could win MAS's and  Convergence's support in the legislature, the 10 votes belonging  to AD and Cause R would be enough to unseat him.    AD is the majority party in this state.  <H5>  Lara </H5>   This is another state that is having problems, although not  exactly caused by the new balance of power. The CSE called  partial elections for governor under an order from the Supreme  Court, which annulled vote tallies. Mariano Navarro (AD) is  still governor, but the MAS-Convergence axis swept the December  elections and is now predominant with 12 of the 23 seats in the  assembly. AD has five, Copei four, and Cause R two.    Even if Mariano Navarro is retained as governor in the 10  April elections, his annual report could be rejected by a  two-thirds majority if Copei decided to vote with Convergence,  Cause R, and MAS. This state government is unstable as long as  AD is in power.  <H5>  Merida </H5>   Governor Jesus Rondon Nucete (Copei) was reelected in 1992  with 49 percent of the vote. The balance of power resulting from  the December elections left him in a difficult position,  however, as his party won only four of the 15 seats. The other  11, which constitute a two-thirds majority, are held by  Convergence (six), AD (four), and Cause R (one).  <H5>  Miranda </H5>   Copei Governor Arnaldo Arocha Vargas was reelected in  December 1992, running basically as a Copei-MAS candidate in an  alliance of 17 groups. He won with 62.3 percent of the vote. The  balance of power in the assembly is now even, with Cause R  holding eight as the primary party, Copei holding six, AD and  Convergence each holding four, and MAS holding one. Fifteen  votes are needed to remove the governor by rejecting his annual  report. Arocha Vargas was a Caldera governor during his first  term, and he is thought to have good relations with the  president. During the campaign, he gave tepid support to Alvarez  Paz.  <H5>  Monagas </H5>   Guillermo Call (AD) is governor. His party took first place  in the recent 1993 elections and now has seven of the 15 deputy  seats, giving it a wide margin of stability. It does not have a  majority in the legislature, so the governor's report may be  voted down, but his stay in office would not be threatened. Call  was reelected in 1992 with 52.4 percent of the vote.    Cause R has three deputies in the legislature, Copei three,  and Convergence two, constituting a simple majority.  <H5>  Nueva Esparta </H5>   Morel Rodriguez (AD) has been governor of this island state  since 1989. He was reelected in 1992 with 48.81 percent of the  vote, giving him a slight lead over Rafael Tovar (Copei). The  elections are being challenged in court.    AD controls six of the 13 seats in the legislature. Copei  has  four, and Cause R, Convergence, and MAS have one each. The  opposition to this governor now has a simple majority to vote  against his report, but it does not have the nine votes required  for a two-thirds majority.  <H5>  Portuguesa </H5>   Governor Elias D'Ongia has been in office since 1989. He was  reelected in 1992 with just 36.8 percent of the vote, and the  results are being challenged in the Supreme Court.    The new balance of power left him in a precarious position,  although his party still has the largest minority share. There  are five groups: AD has five of the 15 legislators, and the  other 10, who make up a two-thirds majority, are divided among  Copei (four), Convergence (three), MAS (two), and Cause R (one).  The balance of power is unstable.  <H5>  Sucre </H5>   The elections in this state were repeated in May 1993. The  governor is Ramon Martinez (MAS). The balance of power in the  legislature is unstable. AD has six of the 17 deputies, MAS  five, Copei three, Cause R two, and Convergence one.    With 11 votes against his annual report, the governor will  be  out of office. The government can block the removal with seven  votes.  <H5>  Tachira </H5>   Governor Ron Sandoval (AD) was reelected in 1992 with 45  percent of the vote. The new balance of power in the Tachira  legislature gives AD six of the 19 votes. Thirteen votes are  needed to oust the governor by rejecting the report. The  opposition has exactly 13 votes, divided as follows: Copei six,  Convergence three, Cause R and MAS two each.  <H5>  Trujillo </H5>   Governor Jose Mendez Quijada (AD) was reelected in 1992 with  48.4 percent of the vote. AD kept enough power in the regional  legislature after last year's elections to block rejection of  the annual report by two-thirds majority.    AD won six of the 15 legislative seats, leaving nine for the  opposition. Ten votes are necessary to remove Governor Trujillo:  Copei has five, Convergence three, and Cause R one.  <H5>  Yaracuy </H5>   Nelson Suarez Montiel (Copei) is governor of this state,  having been reelected in 1992 in an alliance of 24 parties, led  by Copei. At that time he won 66 percent of the vote. After the  December elections, however, his government became unstable.  Nine votes are needed to remove him, and eight of them are held  by the opposition: Convergence four, AD two, and MAS and Cause R  one each. Copei has five deputies who, if they all continue to  support the governor, can block a two-thirds majority vote to  reject the report.  <H5>  Zulia </H5>   Lolita Aniyar de Castro (MAS-Convergence) is governor. This  is the only one of the 22 states where the governor was elected  at the same time as the legislative assembly. The balance of  power ended up unfavorable to the elected leader, however: MAS,  Convergence, and Cause R, which supported Governor Aniyar, have  eight of the 24 votes in the legislature; Copei has 10 and AD  six. AD and Copei between them constitute a two-thirds majority.    The report to be submitted this year is not about the work  of  the current governor, however, since Aniyar just started her  term.</p>

			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REGULATORS SAY BUSH'S SON HID TIES TO S&amp;L BORROWERS  </P> <P> President Bush's son, Neil, serving as a director of a Colorado savings and  loan association that later failed, voted to approve $106 million in loans to  one of his business partners, federal regulators told the House Banking  Committee on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Bush also actively sought approval of a $900,000 line of credit for another  partner in his oil exploration business. In both cases, Bush violated conflict  of interest regulations, officials of the Office of Thrift Supervision said.  </P> <P> Bush staunchly denied any wrongdoing after federal regulators filed an  administrative complaint in January, accusing him of violating conflict of  interest regulations. He refused to accept a settlement with the government,  saying "a settlement agreement would leave an implication that I misbehaved as  a director of Silverado (Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Assn.). I have done  nothing wrong."  </P> <P> Tuesday's revelations of the large sums of money involved will focus a new  political spotlight on the President's 34-year-old son. He was not available  for comment Tuesday but is scheduled to testify before the committee today.  </P> <P> The collapse of hundreds of S&amp;Ls has become the biggest financial disaster  in recent history. Each political party would like to persuade the public to  blame the other for costing the taxpayers $400 billion or more over the next 30  years to close S&amp;Ls and pay off depositors.  </P> <P> Bush's business partners, Bill Walters and Kenneth M. Good, were major  borrowers at Silverado Saving &amp; Loan, where Bush was a director from 1985  to 1988. All of Walters' $106 million in loans eventually went into default.  The Denver-based Silverado collapsed into insolvency and was seized by the  federal government in 1988.  </P> <P> Paying off Silverado depositors will cost taxpayers an estimated $1 billion,  since accounts of up to $100,000 are federally insured.  </P> <P> Under intense questioning from committee Democrats on Tuesday, federal  regulators provided the first detailed look at Neil Bush's activities in  connection with loans to Walters and Good, Denver business executives who  furnished the capital for Bush's oil exploration company, JNB.  </P> <P> As a Silverado board member, Bush approved $106 million in loans to Walters  during 1986, either voting direct approval or ratifying the decision to make  loans by the S&amp;L investment committee, according to Stephen P. Hershkowitz,  deputy director of enforcement for the Office of Thrift Supervision. Bush  should have filed a statement with the S&amp;L detailing his business ties with  Walters, according to the regulator.  </P> <P> Bush had information that was "relevant and did not disclose it," Hershkowitz  said.  </P> <P> The $900,000 line of credit for Good was intended to help one of Good's  companies develop business in Argentina. Although the board approved the credit  line, the money was never used.  </P> <P> It was a conflict of interest for Bush to promote the Good transaction while  serving as a director, according to the regulators. They said he violated the  "duty of loyalty" that requires directors to put first the interests of the  financial institution.  </P> <P> The allegations against Bush still face review by an administrative law judge,  which could result in a cease-and-desist order barring him from similar  conflicts if he ever works for a federally regulated financial institution in  the future. The charges also could be referred to the Justice Department for  possible further action, either civil or criminal.  </P> <P> Bush resigned his seat on the board in August, 1988, after his father, then  vice president, was nominated as the Republican candidate for President.  </P> <P> Silverado was taken over later that year because "its management developed an  excessive concentration of commercial real estate loans and investments," David  L. Paul, Colorado commissioner of financial services, told the committee.  </P> <P> The officers and directors of Silverado "used the institution for their own  greedy purposes," said Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.), a committee member.  </P> <P> "If it weren't for the tragic consequences to the taxpayers, Silverado would  make a wonderful prime-time television soap opera," he said. "It would rank  right up there with 'Dallas' and 'Falcon Crest.' "  </P> <P> Federal regulators have made 11 referrals for prosecution in connection with  Silverado, including five recommendations for criminal prosecutions, details of  which have not been disclosed. Referrals for prosecution in the case began in  1986 and have continued until this year, regulators told the committee.  </P> <P> Committee members bristled angrily when Hershkowitz said he had been forbidden  to tell them the specific dates when the recommendations for criminal  prosecutions had been sent to the Justice Department. An OTS official said that  following a call from the Justice Department Tuesday morning, T. Timothy Ryan  Jr., the head of the Office of Thrift Supervision, instructed his staff to  refuse to provide information about the timing of criminal referrals.  </P> <P> Rep. Paul E. Kanjorski (D-Pa.) charged the Justice Department didn't want the  committee or "the American people to know how slow" the department has been in  going after S&amp;L wrongdoers.  </P> <P> The committee chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Ohio), noted that the  committee would seek to subpoena former regulators who refused to testify about  Silverado. But he emphasized that Neil Bush has announced his "complete  cooperation with the committee. He has been forthright."  </P> <P> Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa), a committee member, defended Bush as an innocent  victim of scheming executives connected with Silverado. "I know Neil Bush is a  thoughtful young man" who may have been "lured into being an outside director,"  said Leach.  </P> <P> It is "inconceivable Neil Bush wittingly did anything wrong," Leach said. "He  is a fine young man."  </P></p>

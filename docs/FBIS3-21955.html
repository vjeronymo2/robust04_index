			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Winding Up the Narcotics Control Board"] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has issued orders to  dismantle the Pakistan Narcotics Control Board [PNCB] with  immediate effect and to make it a part of the National Narcotics  Control Agency in the wake of the board's failure to check  narcotics smuggling. The chairman of the PNCB has been removed  from his current post and appointed as an officer on special  duty, while Major Salahuddin Ghazi, the director general of the  Antinarcotics Task Force, has been temporarily appointed as  chairman of the PNCB [sentence as published].    In view of the large funds provided to the PNCB and wide  powers given to it, one would have rightly expected that the  board would play a very important role in checking smuggling and  the growth of the narcotics menace. The PNCB has not only  miserably failed in achieving the targets and objectives, but  some of its officials have also been found to be involved in the  narcotics trade. Several domestic and foreign agencies have  vehemently criticized its performance. Under these  circumstances, even the general public was questioning the  justification for the continued existence of the PNCB in view of  its miserable performance despite such a formidable amount of  money invested in it. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has taken  an important step by disbanding the PNCB, which was an  inevitable step in the interest of the nation and the country.  However, the new task force set up to control narcotics  smuggling needs to be made so effective that its solid  performance in eliminating drug smuggling should by itself  become visible to the public. A close watch should also be kept  on the officials of the task force, so that they remain free of  all the shortcomings, weaknesses, and corruptions that led to  the dissolution of the Pakistan Narcotics Control Board.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Nabisco modifies scheme to create two types of share RJR NABISCO, the large food and cigarettes manufacturer, is to proceed with its 'targeted stock' scheme - which will create two classes of shares, one pegged to the fortunes of its tobacco division and one to the performance of its food operations - in spite of the cigarette price war begun by Philip Morris, a rival manufacturer, earlier this month. RJR Nabisco says its scheme will be modified in two important respects. First, the group will simply proceed with the sale of 93m RN-Nabisco shares to new investors. These shares will be pegged to the food operations' performance and represent a 25 per cent interest in the food group's equity. RJR Nabisco will not issue RN-Nabisco shares to existing investors in the company at this stage. Instead, the existing RJR Nabisco shares will be renamed as RN-Reynolds shares once the RN-Nabisco flotation has gone ahead, and Reynolds group will retain the remaining 75 per cent interest in the food group's equity. This contrasts with the original targeted stock scheme, which envisaged that another 142m RN-Nabisco shares would be issued to existing RJR Nabisco shareholders about six months after the flotation of RN-Nabisco shares. Secondly, the company will delay declaring any dividends on the renamed RN-Reynolds shares until 'there is a clear assessment of the domestic tobacco operating environment and the company can initiate a dividend policy that is consistent with its capital structure and credit rating targets'. This group of shares will carry a 'pass-through' dividend of about three cents a share from the third quarter of 1993 onwards, reflecting this stock's retained interest in the dividend-paying food interests. The scheme retains the all-important fund-raising elements of the original package. The flotation of the RN-Nabisco shares is scheduled to raise about Dollars 1.5bn - a valuable contribution to RJR Nabisco's ongoing effort to pay down the heavy debts dating back to the Dollars 25bn leveraged buyout of the company in 1989. It will also let the company report the performance of its food side - likely to be in better shape than tobacco in the immediate future - separately.</p>

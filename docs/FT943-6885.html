			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Conveniently ignoring the facts Sir, I cannot let Mr Reamsbottom's unfounded assertions which were made in the letters column (August 23) go unchallenged. On the subject of consultancy and market testing, Mr Reamsbottom is ignoring the facts which do not fit his preconceptions. Far from the government not providing detailed evidence to back up the claims about market testing savings, this information is publicly documented and is available in the Citizen's Charter Second Report and in the detailed information provided to the Treasury and Civil Service Committee. I deduce that the figure of Pounds 39m which Mr Reamsbottom claims has been 'run up' on consultancy costs for market testing has in fact been compiled from adding together the amounts which were contained in three parliamentary answers - covering different periods, answering differently framed questions and risking triple counting] He should also know better than to claim that the Efficiency Unit prevents in-house civil service teams from competing in market tests - the bidders for each competition are decided on a case by case basis within individual departments.

			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> KEYS RESIDENTS FILE POLLUTION CLAIMS  </P> <P> The city of Ventura has received 87 legal claims in the past week from  residents of the Ventura Keys, a posh waterfront neighborhood just west of  Ventura Harbor, demanding that the city clean up their polluted waterways.  </P> <P> The claims, the first step in filing a lawsuit, allege that the city is  responsible for coliform counts far in excess of federal standards for the Keys  Channels, designated as a water sports area.  </P> <P> Residents are also demanding that the city dredge the Keys and reimburse them  for losses in property values resulting from the contamination, said attorney  Don Adams, a spokesman for the homeowners.  </P> <P> The city has 45 days to respond to the claims, after which the plaintiffs will  have up to six months to file suit, Adams said.  </P> <P> Keys residents say city drain runoffs are largely responsible for pollution.  They have told the City Council that unless a compromise is reached, they will  sue the city before the end of the year.  </P> <P> Keys residents would seek $100 million to $150 million in compensatory damages,  Adams said.  </P> <P> Councilman Todd Collart said Monday that he hoped that a lawsuit could be  averted, but negotiations between the two parties have dragged on fruitlessly  for months.  </P> <P> City officials say Keys residents -- not city taxpayers -- should pay for the  bulk of the cleanup.  </P> <P> City Manager John Baker said he believed that the area was erroneously  designated as a water sports area because most marinas in the state do not have  that designation. He said he will seek a change in the designation, which would  eliminate restrictions on high coliform counts.  </P> <P> On Sept. 24, after a sewage spill was detected, the city closed the area's two  small beaches and banned swimming in the channels. The ban is still in effect.  </P> <P> As for dredging, city officials say they are responsible for only one-fourth of  the silt accumulation in the channels, and they have offered to pay 25% of the  dredging costs -- an offer that the residents have rejected.

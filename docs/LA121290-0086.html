			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS;  </P> <P> INDUSTRIAL AREA ZONE CHANGES OKD  </P> <P> The City Council has approved a new zoning ordinance that includes a ban on  churches, dance studios, fraternal organizations and martial arts schools in  industrial areas. The new ordinance also places restrictions on child care  centers in those areas.  </P> <P> The ordinance, passed unanimously this week, was designed to make sure that  neighboring businesses remain compatible and that industrial areas remain safe,  City Manager Robert C. Dunek said. Seven businesses or organizations now in  operation will be affected by the new ordinance, and all will be allowed to  retain their sites, city officials said. But some business owners said the  ordinance will still have an impact.  </P> <P> Dale and Sharon Williamson, the owners of the Kidnastics gymnastics instruction  studio, believe they will lose negotiating power when their lease comes up for  renewal. They also predicted that the remaining businesses and organizations  would eventually dwindle to just one or two because they won't be able to  afford the higher rents outside industrial areas.  </P> <P> "The seven of us will not be around forever," Sharon Williamson said. " . . . I  feel that we have to look at these businesses as valuable parts of the  community."  </P> <P> But Councilman Anthony R. Selvaggi said that allowing special privileges to the  seven businesses could undermine the new code. "Every time we make a change in  our zoning code, some business is affected," he said.  </P> <P> The council asked staff members to try to come up with ways to assist the  businesses and organizations when they renegotiate their leases.  </P> <P> The ordinance also limits child care centers to those housed within an  industrial business. It also requires that employees of the business be the  primary users of the child care facility. Under the old code, day care centers  were allowed as separate facilities to serve any number of businesses in an  industrial center.  </P> <P> In addition, the ordinance calls for placing limits on the use of real estate  signs in public rights of way. Real estate agents will be working with city  officials to draft the new restrictions, which could include setting limits on  height and the length of time a sign can be posted. TED JOHNSON  </P></p>

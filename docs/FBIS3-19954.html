			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Luxembourg, March 24 (AFP) -- The European Court of  Justice turned down a complaint from Air France here Thursday  [24 March] that the British Airways purchase of the airline Dan  Air might have breached European Union competition rules.    The Court turned down Air France's claim that the purchase  of  Dan Air in 1992 should have been investigated by the EU  competition authorities.    The Court said Dan Air's turnover was not big enough to  trigger an anti-trust investigation.    The European Commission approved the purchase last year  after  ruling that the resultant merger would not produce unfair  competition for the Belgian airline Sabena.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Music and rentals help Thorn EMI rise 27% Strong performances by its main music and rentals divisions helped Thorn EMI to lift interim pre-tax profits by 27 per cent from Pounds 99m to Pounds 125.8m. The popularity of the latest releases by the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd helped push up operating profits at EMI Music from Pounds 89.9m to Pounds 101.3m on sales of Pounds 877m (Pounds 778.3m) for the six months to the end of September. Next week's release of a double album of recordings made by the Beatles in the early 1960s for the BBC is expected to contribute to a strong second half. Thorn Group lifted operating profits from Pounds 52.6m to Pounds 57.9m on the back of increased cost efficiencies and new products. Turnover rose from Pounds 714.5m to Pounds 760.6m. In the UK, revenues from the rental base were ahead for the first time in recent years, mainly because of the Option-2-Own concept. HMV, the music retailer, cut its interim losses to Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 6.5m) after a 17 per cent sales rise to Pounds 192.3m (Pounds 164.9m). Sir Colin Southgate, chairman, described the results as 'tremendously positive' and a pointer to a good outcome for the year as a whole. 'We could not have asked for anything better,' he said, expressing surprise at the market reaction: the shares closed down 24p at 973p. Total group sales fell to Pounds 1.94bn (Pounds 2.06bn), including sales from discontinued operations. Sales from continuing operations increased from Pounds 1.85bn to Pounds 1.93bn. The operating loss at TSE, the remaining technology businesses including Thorn EMI Electronics, fell to Pounds 4m, against Pounds 14.7m when there were significant restructuring costs. The group is in talks about the sale of its defence sensors business to Racal Electronics, and its other defence business to Thomson-CSF of France. The two divisions account for 80 per cent of Thorn EMI Electronics sales. It expects to complete the sale to Thomson by the end of the financial year in March. Yesterday Sir Colin said he hoped the sale to Racal would also be completed by then. Capital spending rose by Pounds 50.2m to Pounds 308m. Sir Colin said the group was expanding in Europe, America, Australia and the UK, and was investing in new rental products and new shops, as well as in information technology and manufacturing in the music side. Earnings per share rose from 13.2p to 17.1p. After adjusting for exceptional charges of Pounds 13.1m, mainly related to the sale of Thorn Security in May, earnings were 21p, up from 16.4p when exceptional charges were Pounds 10m. The interim dividend is 9.75p (9p).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev April 13 UKRINFORM-TASS -- The first shipment  of nuclear fuel cassettes has arrived from Russia at Europe's  largest nuclear power station in Zaporizhzhe, Ukraine. It is a  compensation for the nuclear warheads Ukraine has dismantled.    This means that practical implementation has begun of the  measures envisioned in the trilateral statement signed by the  presidents of Russia, Ukraine and the United States in Moscow in  January.    According to specialists, the fuel delivered to the  Zaporizhzhe nuclear power station will suffice to keep one of  five power-generating units operating for a year and give  Ukraine 5.5 to six billion kilowatt hours of cheap electricity.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Minorco makes Pounds 55m Spanish acquisition from Redland MINORCO, the overseas investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, has agreed to pay Pounds 55m to acquire a Spanish aggregates and concrete business from Redland, the UK building materials group. The deal marks a further expansion of Minorco's growing European quarries operations. It is buying Steetley Iberia, purchased last year by Redland when it acquired the Steetley group in a contested takeover bid worth Pounds 613m. The Spanish business, comprising 14 quarries and gravel pits and 21 ready mix concrete plants, is the leading supplier or aggregates and concrete to the Madrid market. The sale price constitutes an exit p/e of almost 18 on profits of Pounds 5m last year, assuming a 38 per cent tax charge. Spanish construction output, however, is forecast to fall by up to 4 per cent this year. Profits of Steetley Iberia could slip to between Pounds 2m and Pounds 3m this year, putting the sale on a prospective exit p/e of about 30. In that case Redland would have received a good price for the business, said analysts. Minorco has built up its European quarries business from a standing start two years ago beginning with with acquisition of Elbekies in the former east Germany for Dollars 108m. This was followed by the purchase of the Lausitzer hardstone quarry business, also near Berlin, for Dollars 17m. In the UK Minorco paid Dollars 207m to ICI for Buxton Lime Industries. Mr John Draper, who recently took over as managing director of the industrial minerals division, said the company had every intention of adding more acquisitions and more countries to its European business. In the six months to December 31, these reported operating profits of Dollars 23m (Pounds 16m) on sales totalling Dollars 75m. Redland, which announces its 1992 results on Thursday, has raised more than Pounds 150m from disposals since the autumn, including more than Pounds 90m from former Steetley businesses. Despite this, gearing is still thought to be between 55 per cent and 60 per cent after the sale to Minorco. Redland said that Steetley had originally bought the Spanish operations for more than Pounds 80m but that had subsequently been written down to Pounds 55m in Redland's books.</p>

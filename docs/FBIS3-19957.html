			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed MTH/RHR: "European Parliament: Enlargement </F> Linked to Fair Solution on Institutional Question"; as released  by Brussels BELGA Database]    [Text] Brussels, 23 Mar (BELGA) -- The European Parliament  (EP) warned on Wednesday [23 March] that it would not approve  accession agreements with Austria, Finland, Norway, and Sweden  if it involved the weakening of the decisionmaking process  within the European Union (EU).    MEP's [members of the European Parliament] at a two-day  meeting in Brussels accused Great Britain of wanting to "dilute"  the Union, of "depriving the Treaty of Maastricht of its  meaning," and of seeking to serve domestic political interests  by refusing to adopt the decisionmaking process after the four  candidates join the Union.    The blocking minority within the Council of Ministers is at  present 23 votes out of 76. Logically enough, this should be  increased to 27 votes out of 90 following enlargement in order  to keep it at 30 percent of the votes.    Great Britain and Spain, for different reasons, are opposed  to this purely mathematical change in the blocking minority and  are asking for it to stay at 23 votes out of 90, which allows  two large countries and one small one to block any decision.    After having listened to European Foreign Affairs  Commissioner Hans van den Broek stress the negative effects of  any change to the membership timetable, the MEP's stressed that  no compromise was possible on an institutional retreat. The EP  considers a blocking minority of 27 votes to be absolutely  essential.    "Even if a compromise is reached, it will always be weak and  unacceptable to the EP," stressed Raymonde Dury (Belgian,  Socialist Party).    Mr. van den Broek stated that the Twelve would try to break  the deadlock again at their informal meeting next weekend in  Ioannina, Greece. If they manage to reach an agreement on the  institutional question, the EP will have little time to approve  the accession agreements before the European elections in June,  thus allowing Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden to join the  Union on 1 January 1995 as planned.</p>

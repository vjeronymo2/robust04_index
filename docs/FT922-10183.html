			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Letter: Promoting women Sir, It is encouraging to read about British industry's moves to promote women in the workforce ('An opportunity not to be missed', April 27). But I wonder how much of this is hot air. Unfortunately, Opportunity 2000 gives huge companies, with well-oiled public relations machinery, the chance to churn out positive statements. But while talk of company 'reviews', 'examinations of policy' and 'increased awareness' may sound impressive, is anything really being done? Obviously some companies are taking the issue seriously - but others are not and have a very arrogant attitude to promoting women. I feel this was demonstrated by your quote from BT which, pointing to a cultural change within the company, said its female staff 'are slowly stopping behaving like surrogate men'. I suggest this reveals the true BT. It is dismissing women who have already struggled on BT's promotion ladder, and is blaming those women's lack of success on their attitudes rather than those within the BT hierarchy.

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of The Philippines (1): Gaining on the neighbours - The government has devised a programme which it hopes will produce economic growth closer to that of other south-east Asia countries As the 'sick man of Asia' for much of the past decade, the Philippines missed the investment flows that helped to transform the region, where it enjoys a strategic geographic position, into the world's economic growth leader. But the patient, having been wheeled out of intensive care, is now leaving the recuperation ward, and is ready to join in the dynamic regional economic development. The Philippines is 'in the most advantageous position, for at least a generation, to finally realise its true economic potential,' said Mr Howard Handy, senior resident representative in Manila of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in a recent talk with locally based businessmen. He said the outlook for the country remained 'highly encouraging' following the launch of 'a home-grown (economic) programme, well crafted by a competent and committed administration.' This programme aims to lift the Philippines' economic growth rate from 2.3 per cent in 1993 to about 6 per cent by 1997 - closer to the levels achieved by its south-east Asian neighbours. It also seeks an inflation rate of 4 per cent by 1997, to assist the country's competitiveness with a stable exchange rate. The economic programme was granted IMF support in June, with a three-year credit worth Dollars 684m. This in turn triggered a rescheduling package from the country's Paris Club official creditors, covering debts falling due until the end of 1995; and new official development assistance commitments worth Dollars 2.8bn each for 1994 and 1995 by the World Bank-led consultative group of aid donors. By the end of these assistance programmes, the Philippine economy should already be taking off, officials led by Mr Roberto de Ocampo, the finance secretary, forecast. After struggling with power shortages in 1992 and 1993, investors are becoming more aggressive, in an environment made more open and liberalised by the government's reform initiatives. The labour sector, too, has stabilised, with fewer strikes in the past couple of years. The economy grew in the first quarter of this year by 4.8 per cent, the best performance for a three-month period since 1990; and early estimates point to second-quarter expansion of more 5 per cent over last year. This has led to expectations that the 4.5 per cent target for the whole of 1994 will be exceeded. The government of Mr Fidel Ramos, the cigar-chomping former army general who won the 1992 presidential elections with just 23 per cent of the vote, continues to consolidate its hold on power by widening a 'rainbow coalition' with members of Congress. In late August, Mr Ramos's ruling Lakas-National Union of Christian Democrats (Lakas-NUCD) party forged an alliance with the opposition Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (Struggle of the Democratic Filipino). While the alliance was ostensibly intended to achieve a common ticket for the 1995 elections for congressional and local-government officials, it also enhanced the administration's chances of getting legislative support for its wide-ranging reform measures. 'Through coalition-building and consensus politics,' said Mr Jose de Venecia, speaker of the House of Representatives and secretary-general of Lakas-NUCD, 'the Philippines will be achieving its own economic miracle.' The miracle, however, would be 'of a slightly slower pace (compared with other Asian growth rates), since we are trying to achieve results without a dictatorship and without recourse to arms.' The Filipinos' sad experience with the strong-man rule of the late Ferdinand Marcos, who was ousted in 1986 and died in exile in Hawaii three years later, has been a significant factor behind the strong preference for democracy. Mr Ramos has achieved the political stability on which economic gains are being erected. So far, his reform initiatives have largely withstood the resistance from sectors most hurt by the changes. His tax reform programme received encouragement in August, with a favourable Supreme Court ruling on the new, expanded value-added tax law, paving the way for its much-delayed implementation. The VAT law had been opposed by various sectors, which feared that it would lead to increased inflation. Another achievement of the Ramos government has been the restoration of a normal electricity supply to the main island of Luzon, including metropolitan Manila. During 1992 and 1993, industrial activity had been handicapped by power-cuts that often lasted between 10 and 12 hours a day. With the granting of emergency powers by Congress, in 1993, Mr Ramos facilitated the entry of private groups into power projects that were exempted from the usual cumbersome procedures for government undertakings. In less than a year, the supply shortage was overcome - even if local power rates are now the second-highest in Asia, because most of the available capacity comes from oil-fuelled stations. The president has also cemented relations with the country's neighbours in Asia, by visiting all of them during his first year, along with a trip last November to the US, the Philippines' old colonial master. On all of these visits, Mr Ramos has encouraged investment in the Philippines. This month, he takes his programme to Europe, with stops in Belgium, France, Spain, Germany and Italy, where he will once again deliver the message: 'The Philippines is back in business in the heart of the world's fastest-growing region.' Mr Ramos approaches the future with confidence. He recently launched a programme of 'three modernisations'. In his state-of-the-nation address in June, the president listed these as: increasing the economy's productivity and competitiveness; making 'people empowerment' work, in place of political patronage; and social reform, to modernise the Filipino family and the national community. He said there would be more attention to small and medium-sized industries as the 'building blocks of economic democracy'. There would also be an orientation towards exports, augmented by the country's accession to the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Further reforms in government would include a reorganisation and streamlining of the bureaucracy. 'We are not getting the full worth of every peso we spend on each government agency,' he said. As part of its social-reform agenda, the government will channel more money into basic education, health care and land reform. Its proposed budget for 1995 allocates 22.3 per cent of expenditure to social services - the second-largest item after business-related and infrastructural spending, which receives 43.9 per cent. These policies have not failed to gain favourable reaction even from some of the country's leading opposition politicians. Mr Juan Ponce Enrile, a former member of the Marcos cabinet and currently a member of the House of Representatives, said recently: 'I think one should not be blind to the fact that the administration has got this country out of the doldrums, and we are now stabilising and moving forward.' Other observers familiar with the Philippines, however, say that after the recent gains, the next question will be: 'how long before the next self-inflicted setback?' Dramatic gains have also been recorded in past attempts to put the government and the economy in order. In 1988, economic growth was approaching double digits, but attempted coups d'etat towards the end of 1989 scared investors away. In the early months of the Ramos government, a series of kidnaps, mainly of ethnic Chinese and foreign nationals, also deterred foreign investors. That problem has been contained, particularly by Mr Ramos's placing Mr Joseph Estrada, his vice-president, in charge of the presidential anti-crime commission. Some economists warn that the current deficits in the country's trade account, if not reduced, could precipitate another crisis in its external transactions, leading to another 'boom-and-bust' cycle like those that defeated previous attempts at sustained economic growth. So far, however, economic managers say that healthy capital flows have made up for these trade gaps. The World Bank, in a report in June, noted that the government's initiatives had created opportunities for foreign investors. Other reforms in the legislative pipeline, it added, would 'further enhance efficient private sector development'.</p>

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / GE may buy 20% stake in large Austrian bank THE AUSTRIAN finance ministry has confirmed that it is interested in selling a 20 per cent stake in Creditanstalt, the country's second largest bank, to General Electric of the US. Mr Ferdinand Lacina, a spokesman for the ministry, said the finance minister had been approached by GE management during the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund in Washington in September. GE said it was not its policy to comment on rumours or reports of this kind. The Austrian government holds 49 per cent of Creditanstalt's equity, but is committed to further share sales as part of its privatisation policy. A Creditanstalt spokesman confirmed that GE had expressed a 'basic interest' in buying a share stake. Financial analysts in Vienna speculated that GE's interest related to Creditanstalt's contacts in eastern Europe. These date from before the first world war, when the bank was the largest in the former Austro-Hungarian empire. The bank has worked hard to revive its bases in eastern Europe in the past three years, opening subsidiaries in Budapest, Prague, Warsaw and Ljubljana and setting up investment banking operations. It has also played a pivotal role in the privatisation process in Czechoslovakia, setting up large investment trusts with citizens' privatisation vouchers. The Creditanstalt group also has large industrial holdings, including majority stakes in Wienerberger Baustoffindustrie, the fast growing building materials group and Steyr-Daimler-Puch, the engineering group. The Austrian government reduced its stake in Creditanstalt from 60 per cent to 49 per cent a few years ago, but still holds a majority of the voting shares. It has been committed to selling more of its shares, and Creditanstalt directors have been actively negotiating with potential strategic partners, which have not until recently included GE. However, with the slump in the Austrian stock market, the government has not been pressing the pace to sell its shares, and the finance ministry spokesman said yesterday that a sale to GE was not imminent. The bank had total assets of Sch514.2bn (Pounds 30.4bn) at the end of June.</p>

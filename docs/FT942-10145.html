			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Sunday betting go-ahead welcomed Bookmakers yesterday expressed delight at the decision to allow Sunday betting on horse-racing in England and Wales, but warned that the industry faced strong competition from rival attractions such as do-it-yourself stores and garden centres. The Commons approved Sunday betting by a majority of 101 on Tuesday night. Evening betting, which began last year, has provided a substantial boost to bookmakers, which now hope Sunday racing will do the same. William Hill, the second biggest bookmaking chain with 1,700 shops, said the horse-racing industry would have to introduce new enthusiasts to the sport rather than simply moving weekday customers to Sundays. William Hill said it was not yet clear whether there would be a net increase in race meetings or whether existing fixtures would be moved to Sundays. It is too late to organise betting on Sunday racing this year. Next year bookmakers expect about 12 meetings to take place on Sundays, and say the real effect will not be felt until 1996. A small number of Sunday races without betting have been taking place since 1992. Mr Chris Bell, assistant managing director of Ladbroke Racing, said these have demonstrated that it will be possible to bring new customers to horse racing and betting. Mr Bell, whose company is the biggest bookmaking chain with 1,923 shops, said spectators at Sunday events had been different from those attending races on other days - there had been significantly more families and children. He warned, however, that Sunday was already the main family leisure day. 'We will have to compete with the rest of the leisure industry. The primary opposition will be do-it-yourself, garden centres, pubs and time with the family.' Mr John Morgan, managing director of Coral Racing, said he expected the racing industry to add other attractions to their events, as has happened in other countries with Sunday racing. These could include shopping outlets and parachute jumps.</p>

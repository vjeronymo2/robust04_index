			<p>BFN     [Text] Egypt has warned that the UN could lose its  credibility in the face of the deteriorating situation in  Gorazde. Dr. Nabil al-'Arabi, Egypt's permanent delegate to the  UN, said in a speech to the Security Council last night that the  UN has two alternatives. Either to adopt the collective security  measures stipulated under the UN Charter to end the existing  aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina and force the aggressors  to withdraw or lift the military embargo imposed on Bosnia.    Dr. al-'Arabi noted that the Egyptian delegation had  repeatedly cautioned the Security Council against the  consequences of failure to adopt decisive measures to ensure a  firm and decisive remedy of the deteriorating situation in  Bosnia. He called on the Security Council members to adopt the  immediate and necessary measures to put an end to this tragedy,  which cannot be tolerated. Chief among these measures are for  the NATO to undertake the immediate military actions needed to  lift the siege of Gorazde, force the Serbs to withdraw from the  town, back the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government in its legitimate  right to self-defense, and lift the military embargo imposed on  it, he added.</p>

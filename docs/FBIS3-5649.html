At the meeting, they exchanged views  on how to deal with the "job summit" to be held in Detroit 14-15  March. Nagano said that "severe criticism may be voiced against  Japan's trade and employment policies due to Japan's enormous  amount of trade surplus and low unemployment rate." He then  requested that "Our efforts to reduce the surplus or to ease  regulations should be strongly stressed so that Japan will not  be criticized for `exporting unemployment.'" In response,  Sakaguchi said: "Due to the breakdown at the last Japan-U.S.  summit talks, there is a possibility that Japan will be faced  with a difficult situation. I would like to ask for cooperation  also from the economic circles."</p>

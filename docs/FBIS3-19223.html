Scalfaro has forwarded Berlusconi's complaint to the self-  governing disciplinary body of the judiciary, the Higher Council  of Magistrates (CSM), of which Scalfaro is also chairman, a  presidential communique said.    The statement, drawn up by Berlusconi and his lawyers, has  not been made public but was prompted by recent requests from  public prosecutors in Milan for arrest warrants for six top  Fininvest executives, including Marcello dell'Utri, who heads  the Publitalia '80 advertising giant.    Berlusconi yesterday said he was writing to the president to  raise a problem concerning judges' conduct. "The fact is, you  cannot apply different criteria for different people. For  certain political parties, enquiries are being shelved or put  off. For others, on the other hand, enquiries are being stepped  up, putting hard-working groups in the stocks."    Berlusconi's decision to write to the head of state was  called into question by Milan's chief prosecutor Francesco  Saverio Borrelli who in a television interview said Berlusconi  was "going about things totally in the wrong way."    Borrelli noted that neither the president nor the CSM have  the power to intervene in judicial enquiries or measures taken  by judges in court cases. "They have disciplinary duties but we  are very far away from hypotheses which involve the aspect of  disciplining magistrates," he added.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Nuclear Electric to shed further 2,000 jobs Nuclear Electric is to cut up to 2,000 jobs in the next three years - more than 20 per cent of its workforce. The state-owned nuclear generator for England and Wales attributed some of the cuts to a recent decision by the industry regulator to cap prices in the wholesale electricity pool, which it said could depress 1995-96 profits by up to Pounds 200m. It said it had to compete against private-sector generators. These have cut staff by more than half since privatisation four years ago. The planned cuts will lead to a provision in the company's 1993-94 accounts. The company could not say what the provisions would be, but more than Pounds 150m seems likely. This will partly offset the effect of a sharply improved operating performance, where losses have been reduced to Pounds 224m from Pounds 564m in 1992-93 - excluding the effects of the nuclear levy. The job losses are the latest in a series in the nuclear industry. Last month British Nuclear Fuels said it intended to cut 2,000 of the 7,000 jobs at its Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria in the next five years. Nuclear Electric has already cut nearly 5,000 from its 14,200 total of four years ago. Yesterday's announcement came three days after the company called for ministers to privatise it as it published a submission to the government's nuclear review. Union leaders said yesterday that in cutting so many jobs the company was trying to show that it could be as tough as the electricity companies, which were privatised four years ago. Mr Mike Jeram, head of electricity at the Unison public services and utilities union, said: 'Workers seem to be the victims of a vicious circle of job cuts in which power companies vie with each other to see who can shed the most amount of labour.' Mr Danny Carrigan, national officer of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, said he was astounded at the scale of the cut. In a letter to staff yesterday Mr Bob Hawley, Nuclear electric chief executive, said the company had to continue to reduce costs following the pool price cap. He said: 'We need to refocus our efforts and look carefully at all costs in order to make good some of this loss and to achieve our goal of being the lowest-cost generator.' The company said it had to compete against private-sector generators. Nuclear Electric could only secure its long-term future by achieving the same kind of cost reductions and efficiency improvements as them. Nuclear Electric faces a delay of several weeks in the start-up of the Sizewell B nuclear power station in Suffolk, David Green writes. The company said it would lose more than Pounds 500,000 a day in revenue from electricity sales because of the delay, which has been caused by a further round of public consultation over radioactive discharges from the power station. The station is nearing completion within its budget of Pounds 2.03bn. The new consultation exercise was made necessary after a High Court ruling concerning the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant in Cumbria. The Inspectorate of Pollution said yesterday that the formal period for responses to the discharge application had ended but it would be weeks before they were assessed.</p>

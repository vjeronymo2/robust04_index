			<p>BFN     [Text] At the present time there is no evidence whatsoever  to suggest that the leaking of corrosive products and  plutonium-239 from the torpedo warheads on board the Komsomolets  atomic submarine could do any significant harm to the fishing  industry of countries fishing in the Norwegian and Barents seas.  This conclusion is contained in a report by experts of the  State Ecological Commission of Russia's Ministry for  Environmental Protection and Natural Resources. The experts say  that, even if the most pessimistic forecasts prove correct, the  dose which could be received by man if the plutonium escapes  into the environment is significantly less than the annual  permissible maximum which the human body can absorb. The  conclusions of the expert commission were released by the press  center of Russia's Ministry for Natural Resources.</p>

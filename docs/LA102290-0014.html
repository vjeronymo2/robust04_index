			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CHANG WINS FIRST SET, BUT LENDL TAKES THE NEXT THREE  </P> <P> Top-seeded Ivan Lendl rallied to beat Michael Chang, 1-6, 6-2, 6-1, 6-2, Sunday  and win the Hong Kong Tennis Championships.  </P> <P> Chang, 18, had a fast start, breaking Lendl twice in the opening set, but  Lendl, ranked third in the world, rallied to take the next two sets with ease.  Chang won only one of five service games in the third set.  </P> <P> The third-seeded Chang, who beat Lendl in a five-set match in the fourth round  of last year's French Open, could not duplicate that performance.  </P> <P> He lost his serve in the fifth and seventh games of the fourth set, helping  Lendl win the set and the match.  </P> <P> Lendl, who also won the Super Seiko tournament at Tokyo last week, collected  $200,000. Chang, ranked 14th, received $100,000.  </P> <P> It was the second year in a row that Chang lost in the final. Last year, he was  beaten by Miloslav Mecir of Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> Second-seeded Mary Joe Fernandez beat Barbara Paulus of Austria, 6-1, 6-3, and  won the Porsche Cup tournament at Filderstadt, Germany.  </P> <P> Last year, Fernandez, 19, lost the final to Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina.  Paulus, 20, beat Sabatini in Saturday's semifinals.  </P> <P> Paulus appeared nervous in the first set of the final and never found the  rhythm she displayed against Sabatini. Paulus, ranked 16th in the world,  started with a double fault and lost her first four service games.  </P> <P> Fernandez moved Paulus around the court throughout the 68-minute match.  </P> <P> Even in the second set, when Paulus tried to step up the pace, Fernandez had  little trouble controlling the play and converted her first match point chance  for the victory.  </P> <P> Fernandez, ranked eighth in the world, received $70,000 from the purse of  $350,000. Paulus earned $31,500.  </P> <P> Unseeded Swede Anders Jarryd capped a week of upsets by defeating fourth-seeded  Austrian Horst Skoff, 6-3, 6-3, 6-1, in the final of the ATP CA Trophy  tournament at Vienna.  </P> <P> It was Jarryd's first major victory since 1986. Because of injury, he had  dropped to 175th in the ATP rankings from fifth in 1985.  </P> <P> Goran Ivanisevic of Yugoslavia used big serves and strong groundstrokes to beat  Henri Leconte of France, 6-2, 7-6 (8-6), 4-6, 4-6, 6-1, and win the  $1.1-million European Community Championship at Antwerp, Belgium. Ivanisevic,  19, received $250,000.  </P> <P> Marc Rosset of Switzerland won his first indoor title, defeating Mats Wilander  of Sweden, 6-3, 6-2, in a $500,000 Grand Prix tournament in Lyon, France.  </P> <P> "I wanted to win a tournament before the end of the year and today I've made  it," Rosset said.  </P></p>

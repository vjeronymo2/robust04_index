			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gid'on Alon and Tzvi Zrahya] </F>   [Excerpt] Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur has  disclosed that the Gaza Strip Palestinians have hoarded huge  quantities of weapons. Replying to three motions to the Knesset  agenda by Knesset Members Hanan Porat (National Religious  Party), Efrayim Gur (Likud), and Pini Badash (Tzomet), Gur said  that since the talks on Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip  were launched, the local residents, motivated by the fear of  internal strife, have been hoarding large quantities of weapons.    Gur said that the security forces have been taking action  against this trend, attempting to reduce the quantities of  weapons in the Strip.    He admitted that there is apprehension that the large  quantities of weapons would be also directed against Israelis,  but noted that the incidence of attacks on the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] involving firearms is not high at this stage.

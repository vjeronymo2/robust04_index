A scroll from a Korean living in Longjing City, Jilin  Province, China, shows Chong-il Peak against the background of  Mt. Paektu and, to the right of it, letters "Wijamanbang"  meaning that the greatness of Comrade Kim Chong-il is shedding  rays all over the world, and below a tiger crouching on a rock  before a pine tree representing his grit and courage and  reflecting the wish for his longevity in good health.    A congratulatory poem wishing the dear leader good health  and  a long life came from a veteran in Russia, a "Phoenix treasure  boat" made of gold and silver from a compatriot in America and  rare fish from an old man in Canada.</p>

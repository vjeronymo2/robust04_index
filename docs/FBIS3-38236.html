			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Andrew Marshall: "Rights Boost for Europe's </F> Immigrants"]    [Text] Brussels -- Radical proposals on immigration and  asylum would create new rights for Europe's 9 million legal  immigrants while clamping down on illegal entrants, according to  officials in Brussels.    The proposals are contained in a document from Padraig  Flynn,  Commissioner for Social Policy and Immigration. They are the  first indication of how far the Maastricht treaty may allow the  European Union [EU] to spread its influence into areas  previously the preserve of national governments. Mr Flynn, a  former Irish Justice Minister, risks controversy by tackling  these issues, particularly as some member states such as Britain  dispute the Commission's right to take the lead.    The document aims to accentuate the positive features of  immigration, officials say. The message behind the essentially  liberal plan is that "immigration to Europe has been a positive  development with substantial economic and social benefits," an  official said yesterday. "It has been an enriching process."    Cash is available to assist in integrating immigrants, say  officials. Their rights need strengthening, including measures  to underpin equality, employment, housing, education and  training, particularly those aged between 20 and 30. Employers  and unions would be encouraged to adopt a new code of conduct on  non- discrimination. These programmes would involve "education,  information and new legislation," officials say.    The rights flowing from legal residence vary across the EU  and are often not recognised in other states. A Turkish worker  legally resident in Germany, for instance, would have problems  finding work in Britain. The ways to achieve nationality also  vary throughout the EU, and the Flynn proposals would focus on  using dual nationality. Speeding up the process of gaining  nationality would greatly help to integrate immigrants,  officials say.    Mr Flynn and his officials emphasise this aspect of his  package, even though it also confronts the other side of the  issue -- restricting the flow of immigrants into Europe and  removing those who are already here illegally. The document  recommends tougher measures against illegal immigrants, with a  U.S.-style focus on punishing those who employ them.    The second aspect of the voluminous package is on  immigration  flows, movement of asylum-seekers and immigrants across borders.  The paper focuses on admission procedures, illegal immigration  and refugees, all areas already being tackled. EU ministers  have been working to restrict asylum-seekers by tightening  definitions, accelerating procedures and weeding out "manifestly  unfounded claims."    The Flynn proposals, however, deal with temporary protection  for people who, like some of those fleeing the war in former  Yugoslavia, need shelter, protection and assistance for only a  limited time. The document spells out ways of sharing the burden  among EU states when one or more faces a sudden flood of those  seeking asylum or temporary protection. This controversial idea  was advocated by Germany -- faced with massive migrant flows --  but is resisted by its partners.    The third area examined by the paper deals with the pressure  that causes immigration and the flow of asylum-seekers. It  recommends using trade and aid agreements to improve conditions  in the countries that are a source of migration, and toughening  the stance on human rights with countries where government  oppression creates refugees.    The paper is still being discussed between the different  services of the Commission and may be put before all  Commissioners next week. It would then be sent to the Council of  Ministers, which groups representatives of member states,  including on this issue the Home Secretary, and the European  Parliament. The aim is to create a detailed action programme  for legislation and decisions.    The subject matter will be controversial enough. But some  member states will be deeply opposed to the Commission taking  the lead. The Maastricht treaty created a common policy on  Justice and Home Affairs, but measures are largely left to  member states.    Many proposals will be welcomed by those working on behalf  of  immigrants and asylum-seekers. But they will horrify right-wing  opponents of the EU, since they combine the incendiary elements  of immigration and the Maastricht treaty.    They put more emphasis on the rights of immigrants and  asylum  seekers than previous decisions by EU governments that  concentrated on creating a "Fortress Europe."    The Commission may be taking a generous view of its  abilities  under Maastricht. But Mr Flynn's officials point to existing  powers in the area of social policy which enable him to take  initiatives. And they point out that many of the issues raised  relate to the completion of the single market.</p>

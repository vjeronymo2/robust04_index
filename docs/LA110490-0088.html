			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BYRDS TO SMOOTH RUFFLED FEATHERS FOR INDUCTION  </P> <P> All five original Byrds will be on stage together for the first time in more  than 17 years when they are inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on  Jan. 16 in New York City.  </P> <P> But whether the members of the classic Los Angeles rock band will pick up their  instruments and join in the traditional jam that night remains questionable in  light of longstanding rancor over disputed rights to the Byrds name.  </P> <P> "I'm really honored with the Hall of Fame thing," said Chris Hillman, who was  bassist in the original Byrds. "It's the highlight of my life and I hope we'll  all be up there together. . . . (But) I don't know if I'd ever work again with  Michael Clarke and Gene Clark in the Byrds. I think it works best with me,  Roger McGuinn and David Crosby."  </P> <P> For the five of them to all even speak, let alone play, will be a matter of  letting some serious bygones be bygones. Hillman, McGuinn and Crosby have  fought a public battle in recent years to prevent drummer Clarke from touring  with a band he calls the Byrds.  </P> <P> Last year a Florida judge ruled that Clarke had a right to continue using the  name because he had been doing so for several years without any legal challenge  by the others. Singer Gene Clark -- who wrote such Byrds favorites as "Feel a  Whole Lot Better" and co-wrote "Eight Miles High" -- had also sometimes  performed under a "Tribute to the Byrds" billing, but abandoned that when the  others asked.  </P> <P> "I always hold the hope that we could get rid of all the problems that stand  between us, lay down our pride and just play music and enjoy it," said Gene  Clark in a separate interview.  </P> <P> "We're the five Byrds, and I hope that can really happen," added Clark, who  left the Byrds in 1966. In the mid-'70s, he and McGuinn teamed as a duo, and  were later joined by Hillman.  </P> <P> McGuinn, too, is hopeful that "as far as standing up and receiving the award,  the focus should be on the music and not the people now." But neither he nor  the others minced words concerning the estrangement.  </P> <P> "We wish Michael would stop going around being the bogus Byrds," McGuinn said.  </P> <P> Hillman was equally direct: "I have no quarrel with Mike. Why deny him making a  living? But the rest of us went out and did other things (without using the  Byrds name) sink or swim. Crosby and I feel . . . that without Roger there  isn't a Byrds."  </P> <P> Clarke's response: "I think that's bull, and you can print that. How about:  'Without me playing drums it's not the Byrds?' We all made major contributions  to the music."  </P> <P> But Clarke, too, is cautiously optimistic that the Hall of Fame setting will  help them overcome the barriers between them.  </P> <P> "I trust that we'll be friends there," he said. "But if not, then no problem. .  . . I pretty much don't care what they think, to tell you the truth."  </P> <P> While Clarke, who lives in Florida, will continue performing as the Byrds, Los  Angeles-based Gene Clark recorded an album with singer-songwriter Carla Olsen  and is planning a second, as well as a solo album. Crosby (who was on vacation  and unavailable) remains active recording and touring with Crosby, Stills &amp;  Nash. Hillman is now a country star with his Desert Rose Band.  </P> <P> Only Hillman, Crosby and McGuinn are heard on the six new recordings included  in the Byrds retrospective boxed set. Two of the songs are Byrds classics  ("Turn, Turn, Turn" and "Mr. Tambourine Man") recorded at the Roy Orbison  tribute concert at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles last February.  (Bob Dylan joined them on "Mr. Tambourine Man.") The other four selections were  recorded in Nashville in August, including a version of Dylan's "Paths of  Victory" and a new McGuinn song, "Love That Never Dies."  </P> <P> The latter song bids a fond adieu to the past with a playful nod to two Byrds  favorites, "Mr. Tambourine Man" and the wistful "Chestnut Mare," which McGuinn  has kept in his repertoire as a solo artist:  </P> <P>  Toss a dime to the tambourine man  </P> <P>  And kiss all the horses goodby.  </P> <P> </P></p>

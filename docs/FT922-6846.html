			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Thatcher warns on transfer of power FROM BEYOND the Commons, Mrs Margaret Thatcher again entered the European debate yesterday, warning that the EC should have acted more vigorously in dealing with what was Yugoslavia, and that the Maastricht treaty was particularly flawed in its transfer of powers to a centralised bureaucracy, Alison Smith writes. In an article in the current issue of The European newspaper, she supported the government's line in strongly resisting any attempt by other EC member states to dilute or remove border controls to deal with international crime, immigration and terrorism. The plight of what was Yugoslavia was used as an example of how the provisions of the Maastricht treaty are 'not in tune with the instincts of the people', who would like to help but see that the EC can do nothing. Among the treaty's other failings, the article said, is that it would not ensure or enhance democratic government because of the power it transferred away from nation states, extending the areas of Community authority and of majority voting. Mrs Thatcher said she was 'very concerned' that the larger role of the Western European Union in European defence arrangements might send the wrong message to the United States about whether the EC wants American troops to continue to be stationed in Europe. The treaty's failure to tackle European protectionism and thus improve world trade was also attacked. On the subject of border controls, she defended the position she negotiated, saying it is a matter of 'good faith (which) once lost is hard to regain' that the other EC countries stand by the general declaration attached to the Single European Act. The Act said that the provisions for free movement of goods and persons would not affect measures that individual countries thought were needed to control immigration from outside the EC as well as to combat terrorism and international crime.</p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / International Company News: HK railways in Dollars 1bn debt programme Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) has arranged a USDollars 1bn debt issuance programme, less than a week after having its credit rating cut. Last Friday, Moody's cut the MTRC's rating for Hong Kong dollar-denominated debt to A1 from Aa2. The move comes with concerns for political stability in China and the possible impact on the colony. Moody's saw vulnerability in the Hong Kong/US dollar peg. Debt issued under the new programme, signed yesterday, can be denominated in any currency, subject to agreement with MTRC, with a maturity of between one month and 30 years. It may take the form of fixed, zero-coupon or floating-rate notes. The programme replaces a HKDollars 3bn medium-term note programme set up in 1988 and which has now matured.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This final rule does not include provisions implementing the sanctions mandated by section 14(p)(3) of the 1937 Act. However, the Department is continuing to work on those provisions, and will take into consideration the remarks provided by commenters in response to the proposed rule. The Department will comply with the requirements within the applicable statutory timeframe.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Use of NOFAs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) HUD is proposing to use NOFAs as the vehicle to convey significant program information to interested PHAs, which defeats the intent of notice-and-comment rulemaking. The proposed rule does not provide sufficient detail on how program funds will be targeted, the format of the vacancy reduction plans, and criteria for determining a PHA's capacity to implement the plan in a timely and effective manner. Use of NOFAs will lead PHAs to try to second-guess HUD on selection criteria and lead to a hit or miss approach on solving the vacancy problem. (CLPHA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department disagrees with this comment. The rule provides the framework for the program and meets or exceeds the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Department's regulations. The preamble to the proposed rule elaborates on the Department's expectations for targeting funds made available for the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department views the program as a dynamic tool in the effort to reduce unnecessary vacancies in public housing. Experience with the program and elimination of certain root causes of vacancies will guide the Department in selecting the optimal criteria for any subsequent targeting of program funds. This targeting would be done in compliance with the statutory parameters of the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department intends to undertake the vacancy reduction effort by providing funding for those vacant units most likely to be turned around quickly, targeting the majority of the funding for units averaging a cost of $8,000 or less, with some funds targeted for units for which a CGP agency can provide the additional funding necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the report of the assessment team is expected to address the capacity of a PHA to implement vacancy reduction activities in a timely and efficient manner. The Department reiterates that the intent of the requirement that participating PHAs submit vacancy reduction plans is to assist in the development of a comprehensive approach to vacancy reduction. As demonstrated by its efforts to solicit the input of industry and PHA representatives during the development of the proposed rule and the initial NOFA, the Department is committed to implementing this program in a constructive way that responds to the needs of PHAs with remediable vacancy problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Before the NOFA is published, there should be a meeting with industry groups. The meeting should be used to share survey results and exchange viewpoints. (PHADA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department solicited the input of representatives of the industry, PHAs, and resident organizations during the development of the proposed rule and the initial NOFA. Meetings were held with these representatives on January 28 and July 9, 1993. The Department believes these meetings have been valuable in helping to develop the program, but does not believe that it is necessary to schedule any additional meetings at this time. The discussions at the previous meetings, along with the written comments received in response to the proposed rule, have provided the Department with a foundation for the policy decisions it has made regarding how to operate this program within the parameters established by Congress. Furthermore, in the NOFA published elsewhere in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the Department discusses the results of the survey, in the context of both general results and specific implications for the program decisionmaking process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The proposed rule seems to imply that more than one NOFA might be published in a single fiscal year. Only one NOFA should be issued and it should coincide with the Comprehensive Grant Program planning process. (PHADA, CHA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The language that referred to ``periodic'' NOFAs in the proposed rule was intended simply to verify that separate NOFAs would be published for any money that is appropriated for the program in subsequent years. This is the common practice of the Department, as established in the HUD Reform Act, but the actual timing of a subsequent NOFA in any fiscal year cannot be predicted. The Department appreciates the commenters' point about the coordination of capital planning programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Relationship of the Vacancy Reduction Program to Other HUD Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) HUD should integrate the approach of the Vacancy Reduction Program into an overall effort to draft a new vacancy rule. The Vacancy Reduction Program itself is insufficient to address problems faced by PHAs with expired Comprehensive Occupancy Plans (COPs); these PHAs still need operating funds to keep vacant units in shape until money is available to make necessary improvements. (CLPHA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Any new vacancy rule would require substantial time for development and implementation. Meanwhile, the Department is committed to providing assistance currently available under the vacancy reduction program to PHAs with vacancy problems. Changes to the determination of operating subsidy eligibility as proposed by the commentor are outside the scope of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Vacancy Reduction Program may duplicate planning requirements of other programs, such as PHMAP and the Comprehensive Grant Program, that also address vacancy problems. (PHADA, CHA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As noted above, the Department appreciates the commenters' point about the coordination of capital planning programs and will endeavor to integrate the vacancy reduction program with other related programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

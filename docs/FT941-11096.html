			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / BMW runs over Heseltine's testament: What has become of the squire of Thenford's views on the motor industry In 1989, I travelled to the border of Northamptonshire and Oxfordshire, to visit the squire of Thenford. This handsome man in an even more handsome Palladian house was, not so surreptitiously, mounting a challenge to the leadership of Mrs (as she then was) Margaret Thatcher. I had come to interview Mr (as he still, temporarily, is) Michael Heseltine. Naturally I made it my business to read the book described as Heseltine's 'personal testament', Where there's a Will. Written in 1987, it set out to defend the author's distinctly unThatcherite views on the running of the economy, particularly in a chapter entitled 'Industry: a strategy.' There the 'president of the Board of Trade' set out a list of those industries which required the special attention of government, foremost among them the British motor car industry. Heseltine opined that no modern industrial economy worth the name could do without a home-owned car industry, and said, inter alia:'For the major part of the British motor industry to fall entirely into foreign hands would leave it a hostage to decisions in Detroit, Paris, Turin . . . that is why the future of the sole-remaining British-owned and British controlled motor manufacturer, Rover, will continue to be a matter for the Government. Otherwise the British motor industry will find itself further down the cul-de-sac to extinction.' This seemed to me at the time, and still does, to be an archaic analysis of the modern industrial economy. What about Texas? The Texans seemed to get on just fine without making a single car, I suggested to Heseltine, in 1989, as we gazed out over his estate from his stupendous drawing room. Not really a country, he said. What about Switzerland? I asked. Not a major industrial power, said Heseltine. He was immovable on this point. So I am afraid I laughed out loud, when I heard the announcement, hot off the Bavarian presses, last Monday morning, that British Aerospace had sold its 80 per cent stake in Rover to BMW for Pounds 800m, with no objections from the president of the Board of Trade. I laughed because I was trying to imagine the discomfiture of Heseltine when his opposite number, Robin Cook, stood up in the House of Commons to quote back at the president of the B of T his own 'personal testament' of undying support for the home-owned British car industry. Unfortunately for the Labour Party their front benchers missed this opportunity, as they have missed so many others in recent months. The press too - which a few years back had mounted a successful campaign against the government's plans to sell Range Rover to General Motors, provoking a rare climb down by Thatcher - was generally acquiescent in the transmutation of Rover into Britische Motoren Werke. Of course, we are all quite right to be so grown-up. We British have been beneficiaries of the anti-protectionist trend, picking up valuable assets all over the world. In general, it makes sense that companies end up in the hands of those who will manage them best: no one can seriously claim that BMW will run Rover worse than the somewhat opportunist management of BAe. Yet, I cannot have been the only free trader who was more than faintly irritated by the spurious claim - since retracted - of the chairman of BMW, Bernd Pischetsrieder, to be the nephew of Sir Alec Issigonis, the designer of the Mini. Nor I imagine, am I the only believer in the free market who was irked by the triumphalism of the German press over the takeover of Rover. 'The Mini is now German' proclaimed the Bild Zeitung, over a photo-montage of Rover Cars bearing the BMW logo. Another German newspaper published a cartoon of Big Ben, with the BMW blue and white emblem in place of the clock face. All harmless of course, but somehow, as I read of these outbursts of German chauvinism, something like the following crossed my mind: 'You are laughing now, Fritz, but I don't think that Daimler-Benz is in such great shape. And have you heard of a company called Hanson ?' Go on James, give us all a thrill, and make Michael Heseltine's day. Dominic Lawson is editor of the Spectator.</p>

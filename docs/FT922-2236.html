			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Observer: Second chance 'Everyone is entitled to one mistake,' says Sir Peter Cazalet, APV's well-connected chairman. Nevertheless, a few eyebrows will cock at the speed with which Clive Strowger, the ex-chief executive of Mountleigh, has found a comfortable new berth as APV's chief executive. APV has been looking for a new chief executive for quite some time - which, coupled with the fact that Strowger has been out of a job since September, suggests he could hardly have been a first-choice appointment. Be that as it may, Cazalet - an ex-BP man who sits on the boards of P &amp; O and Wellcome - has taken extensive soundings and is confident he has made the right selection. Strowger, a respected ex-finance director of GrandMet, has the sort of international experience APV needs if it is to integrate its collection of businesses and avoid being taken over. Strowger is certainly not a maverick and is understood to have been stung by last year's Stock Exchange criticism of Mountleigh's directors, especially since he used to be a member of the exchange's quotations committee. Perhaps he has been harshly treated. Even so, his decision to throw in his lot with US entrepreneurs Nelson Peltz and Peter May in some half-baked idea of transforming a controversial property company like Mountleigh into a proper international business, wasn't just bad luck. It was a monumental error of judgment.</p>

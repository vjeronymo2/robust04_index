			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Spanish Bonds: Investor optimism beginning to wane THE August rally in Spanish bonds, almost entirely fuelled by non-residents, brought yields down by a full point to below 9 per cent. Ignoring events in Spain, the market travelled in the slipstream of enthusiasm elsewhere. But time is running out for the government as it tries to convince the unions of the need for economic rigour, and the optimism that investors demonstrated last month is begining to wane. Last week, bond prices fell by 2 1/2 points and the long end of the market in particular remains vulnerable. Traders want to know, as soon as possible, what the government's much-heralded social pact agreement with the unions is going to look like. In this interim period the good news is that the government and the unions are still talking. The bad news is that it is increasingly looking as if they are not talking about very meaningful rigour. The economy and finance ministry is hinting that its 1994 inflation target will be 4 per cent, against a current annual rate of 4.6 per cent, although it could be reduced to 3.5 per cent if the unions agree to wage restraint. The ministry also says that the general budget deficit will stand at around 5 per cent of GDP, perhaps as high as 5.5 per cent - around half a point less than what is expected this year. Such targets are certainly not ambitious, particularly set against far more aggressive policies unveiled by other European governments. The government's original plan was that negotiations over the social pact, the cornerstone of which is a three-year incomes policy, should be completed before the budget goes before parliament at the end of this month. It appears that talks with the unions and the employers' confederation will continue to the end of the year, and that the wage restraint issue has been set aside to allow for prior agreement on social spending. It is this apparent lack of ambition and seeming absence of urgency that is unsettling the market. As things stand, the government is very unlikely to gain an agreement, as it originally wished, to reduce purchasing power by six points over the next three years. But it could gain assent to essentially flat wages through to 1996. To lock the unions into such restraint the government will probably have to jettison part of its planned reform of the overtly rigid labour laws. But the prize will be the first forward-looking incomes policy in Spain since the early 1980s. In its new mood of realism, Spain's bond market is right to believe that the short end of the curve is the safest. In any case, the Spanish yield curve is among the flattest in Europe, so the main reason not to buy the short end is that it could benefit less from a rally. But looking ahead there is good reason for optimism to return. The onset of recession has been such that the government could have erred on the side of caution by suggesting a 4 per cent inflation target next year, and the Bank of Spain, once satisfied that there is a wage calendar in place, will be in the mood for cutting rates.</p>

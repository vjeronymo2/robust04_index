			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Chemicals hold Shell to 8% increase HIGHER restructuring costs in its troubled chemical division marred the third-quarter performance by Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the Anglo-Dutch oil group. It reported yesterday profits up 8 per cent to Pounds 861m, helped by higher marketing margins and beneficial currency swings. The profits increase - on a current cost of supplies basis, which excludes after-tax changes in inventory values - was in the middle of analysts' expectations. But the share price of Shell Transport and Trading fell 18p to close at 704p as oil prices tested new post-Gulf war lows. The price of benchmark Brent Blend for December fell at one stage to Dollars 15.20 a barrel, compared with an average of Dollars 16.50 during the third quarter. Shell reported that lower oil prices were offset by special tax credits. It said a credit of Pounds 205m was mainly due to a release in tax provisions and a tax-rate change in undisclosed countries. Analysts speculated that tax changes in Malaysia or Nigeria could account for this. Shell's cash flow rose to Pounds 5.8bn from Pounds 4.9bn a year ago, but analysts said there were few signs that cost-cutting was having the dramatic effects reported by British Petroleum and the US majors. With gearing standing at 10.2 per cent, Shell is under less pressure than some of the more indebted majors, say analysts, who also note that it started its cost-cutting later. 'So far there is little evidence of Shell's cost-cutting coming through in the upstream sector,' said Mr Fergus MacLeod of NatWest Securities in Edinburgh, who noted that Shell's earnings per barrel in the third quarter were Dollars 1.97, from Dollars 2.45 in the previous one. Chemicals remained a running sore, losing Pounds 168m in the third quarter and Pounds 341m for the first nine months, compared with losses of Pounds 41m and Pounds 40m in the respective periods last year. Shell reported special charges of Pounds 171m for the quarter. The company warned that the outlook for petrochemicals in Europe was poor, with little improvement until there was a general economic upturn. In common with most other oil majors, Shell reported improved margins in refining and marketing, particularly in Europe. Earnings rose to Pounds 412m in the third quarter compared with Pounds 302m in the same quarter last year. But margins in Asia, where Shell is particularly strong, weakened in the quarter. Earnings per share were 8.6p in the quarter, from 8p, and 24.7p for the nine months, against 22.7p. Lex, Page 18; London SE, Page 38</p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo rises ahead of land auction result SHARE PRICES surged on expectations of today's discount rate cut, but the Nikkei average lost most of the gains on profit-taking to close marginally higher, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average ended 35.72 ahead at 17,222.03. The index, which dipped to the day's low of 17,214.21 in the morning session, shot up to a high of 17,419.18 on reports of a possible 0.75 percentage point cut in the discount rate this week. Volume rose to 340m shares from 244m and gains led declines by 651 to 309, with 187 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 5.79 to 1,307.60, its seventh consecutive rise. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.76 to 1,062.8. Prices remained firm for much of the session on speculation of a rate cut from 3.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent, which would match the all-time low seen during the so-called 'bubble boom' from 1987 to 1989. On the money market, rates on three-month certificates of deposit fell to a record low of 3.25 per cent, although profit taking took the yield on the 10 year No 145 benchmark bond up by 6 basis points to 4.34 per cent. Equity investors took profits after the intraday rise. Valuations for the current market, with the Nikkei at an price-earnings ratio of 55, are also regarded as too expensive by some investors. Some leading banks were higher on hopes of larger profit margins after a discount rate cut. Short covering also helped to boost prices. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y10 to Y2,430 and Sakura Bank gained Y10 to Y1,200. Kyocera expanded the previous day's losses, falling Y50 to Y4,310. Concerns over a lawsuit filed by IBM of the US against Kyocera's use of its software programs depressed sentiment. Isuzu Motors was the most active issue of the day, rising Y8 to Y380. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 104.04 to 18,673.09 in volume of 43.4m shares. Roundup Political considerations weighed on a number of the region's markets. HONG KONG closed higher, although business slowed to a crawl in afternoon trading. Investors were awaiting the results of a government land auction which produced record prices, but came after hours. The Hang Seng index finished 48.27 ahead at 5,710.80 in turnover of HKDollars 1.6bn. Shares derived early strength from the view that Governor Chris Patten's medical treatment could take some of the heat out of the Sino-British row over the territory's political future, at least for the time being. AUSTRALIA was restrained by uncertainty over the date and outcome of the federal elections; the All Ordinaries index was unchanged at 1,530.2 in turnover up from ADollars 193m to ADollars 238m. Coles Myer - outdone in sales growth for the first half by its rival retailer, Woolworths - fell 5 cents to ADollars 4.50. Nine Network Australia shed 11 cents to ADollars 2.65, concerned that it might soon face competition from cable television. SINGAPORE turned lower. The Straits Times Industrial index fell 8.29 to 1,637.59 in volume of 139.52m shares after setting record highs on three consecutive days. SEOUL picked up after late intervention by institutional investors and the composite index firmed 12.16 to 678.34. KUALA LUMPUR was broadly higher after an uncertain start, extending Tuesday's gains. The composite index rose 10.86 to 639.24. JAKARTA was led up by the banking sector as the composite index rose 10.86 to 639.24. BANGKOK saw selective buying in some big banks and properties take the SET index 5.46 higher to 975.26. TAIWAN rose for the fourth straight day in a rally sparked by an easing of political tensions after Premier Hau Pei-tsun announced he would resign. The weighted index, which was up about 50 points at one stage, closed 11.10 ahead at 3,553.36.</p>

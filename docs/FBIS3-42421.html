			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Kiev NARODNA ARMIYA in Ukrainian on 8  December 1993 on page 1 carries an article under the heading  "Heat Turned Off At Sevastopol Naval Institute" reporting a  heating plant shutdown that left the Sevastopol Naval Institute  in a "critical situation."    The existing agreement calls for the supply of heat to the  Sevastopol Naval School by one of a group of Black Sea Fleet  technical networks. Captain 2nd Rank Yevhen Rozhnov, in charge  of this network, informed the Institute leadership that the heat  would be turned off after 30 November in accordance to demands  by the Black Sea Fleet Command, explaining that this measure was  due to a lack of heating oil for the boilers. The heat network  was to be closed up and sealed, to "freeze" the institute.    The report pointed out that some thousand cadets were the  hostages of this disruption, which occurred despite the fact  that the Institute had made full payment for November and,  despite financial difficulties had promised to make prior  payments.    In a subsequent article Kiev NARODNA ARMIYA in Ukrainian on  25 December 1993 on page two showed the Sevastopol Naval  Institute efforts to continue operations in spite of the heat  being turned off since the beginning of December. The article  disputed the explanation that the disruption was due to a lack  of fuel in the Black Sea Fleet. It maintained that the 1760  tonnes of heating oil set aside in the summer would have been  sufficient for the winter. But on 16 August a document arrived  from the Black Sea Fleet, breaking the 30 July agreement for  fuel service to Ukraine's Navy. The article maintained that the  Black Sea Fleet took the oil from Ukraine's Navy to settle  accounts with other Ministry of Defense units.    The report rejects Black Sea Fleet explanations and states  that, "This violation of the juridical side of the agreement  forced Ukraine's Navy fuel service to appeal to an arbitration  court over the disputed material."</p>

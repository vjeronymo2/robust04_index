			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei registers its fifth consecutive loss SHARE prices closed marginally lower as buying by public insurance and pension funds countered profit-taking and arbitrage-linked selling, writes Emiko Terazono. The Nikkei average fell 29.17 to 17,369.91, falling for the fifth consecutive day. The index rose on small-lot buying in the morning session, rising to the day's high of 17,554.56 before falling to the low of 17,104.21 in the afternoon as a decline in the futures market prompted arbitrage unwinding. Volume firmed to 320m shares against 288m. Declines led advances by 672 to 297 with 129 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 6.17 to 1,304.43 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.41 to 1042.16. Buying by public funds remained small, while foreigners were seen taking profits as a consequence of the higher yen. The currency weakened slightly against the dollar, easing pessimism over the effects on company profits of leading exporters, and the overall Japanese economy. Investors targeted issues unaffected by currency rate fluctuations. Food shares firmed, with Ajinomoto gaining Y10 to Y1,320 and Takara Shuzo adding Y35 to Y720. High-technology issues, which were sold off on concerns over lower profits due to the rise in the yen, rose on small-lot bargain hunting. Hitachi gained Y3 to Y730 and Toshiba advanced Y16 to Y570. NEC, however, fell Y17 to Y680. Traders said that worries over the effects of sales of cheaper personal computers by Compaq, the US computer maker, in Japan, depressed the issue. NTT slipped Y20,000 to Y540,000. Investors were discouraged by reports that the company will postpone an increase in telephone rates. Short term speculative issues remained active. Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting, the most active issue of the day, fell Y5 to Y505. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 249.19 to 18,768.41 in volume of 17.6m shares. Roundup THE region remained mixed yesterday. HONG KONG was firmer on a technical rebound, traders said. The Hang Seng index closed up 23.4 at 5,528.84. Unconfirmed Japanese newspaper reports that the hardline Chinese communist leader, Chen Yun, was seriously ill were used as an excuse to buy after a weaker opening. AUSTRALIA closed at an 18-month low although late bargain hunting helped the market off its intraday worst. The All Ordinaries index closed 12.9 down at 1,472.1 in turnover of ADollars 207.2m. Westpac gained 1 cent to ADollars 2.86 on bargain hunting; this followed the resignation of directors after the bank's first half losses of ADollars 1.67bn and its undersubscribed rights issue. BANGKOK was lifted by strong gains in bank, finance and property shares. The SET index gained 12.68 or 1.49 per cent at 859.68 in turnover of Bt12.7bn. Krisda Mahanakorn, the property group, which has fallen sharply over the previous three days, hit its 10 per cent upward limit with a gain of Bt17 to Bt187. NEW ZEALAND lost 1.6 per cent on weakness in the forestry sector. The NZSE-40 index ended down 22.54 at 1,406.91 as Fletcher Challenge shed 4 cents to NZDollars 1.83 and Carter Holt Harvey fell 12 cents to NZDollars 2.45. KUALA LUMPUR extended its losses as the composite index dipped below the key 600-point level, closing down 4.18 at 598.10. Brokers said that investors remained cautious ahead of the Malaysian budget due later this month. SEOUL fell for the fifth consecutive session but in low turnover. The index lost 5.06 to 508.76 in turnover of Won82.6bn. MANILA was helped to a stronger close on foreign buying of selected blue chips. The composite index gained 13.57 to 1,418.11 in turnover of 557m pesos. PLDT gained 15 pesos to 995 pesos.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksey Belyanchev and Marina Lebedeva report: "Refugees: </F> Long Time of Torment"]    [Text] This photograph was taken in a corridor of  "Samargorgrazhdanstroy's" hostel, whose top, ninth floor has now  been taken over by refugees from hot spots in the former USSR  and from those CIS countries where the Russian-speaking  population has felt discriminated against. Some of the refugees  have already lived here for more than a year, paying between  20,000 and 30,000 rubles a month for a tiny room. Twenty-six  families are housed here, while approximately 6,000 such people  have been registered, in all, in Samara alone. Since many  plants in the city are idle or are "half-working," it is very  hard for the newcomers to find work. The refugees' prospect of  acquiring housing is also virtually nil. The municipal budget  is inadequate to house even those on its own waiting list.  According to Oleg Sysuyev, the city's mayor, Samara has given  up practically all it could to accommodate the refugees -- rest  homes, guest houses, tourist bases....    The situation in Samara is archetypal for many cities in  Russia.    As of 1 January this year, according to the data of the  Ministry of Internal Affairs, there were 609,085 refugees and  displaced persons in the Russian Federation, and this figure is  growing. The average percentage of the number of refugees and  displaced persons in the Russian Federation as a whole stands at  0.47 percent. The North Caucasus region is most saturated: The  Ingush Republic -- approximately 50 percent of the size of the  local population; North Ossetia -- 7.5 percent; Stavropol Kray  -- 3.5 percent; Krasnodar Kray -- 2.7 percent; Rostov Oblast --  0.7 percent. The percentage of refugees and displaced persons  is higher than the average for the Russian Federation in certain  oblasts in the Central Region: Belgorod and Tambov Oblasts --  0.8 percent; Orel Oblast -- 0.6 percent; Kaluga Oblast -- 0.5  percent.    In 1992, as is known, the Russian Federation Government  adopted the long-term republic program "Migration" geared to  supporting refugees and displaced persons from countries in the  near abroad. But it is being implemented with tremendous  difficulty. Until our economy starts working in the new, market  way, the country will be unable to substantially ease the lot of  migrants and other categories of people who find themselves in  dire need.</p>

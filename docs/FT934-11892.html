			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Fujimori set to secure his hold: Peruvians likely to vote Yes in constitutional referendum FOR A country still widely perceived abroad as deficient in democracy, Peru has put its citizens through quite a number of electoral procedures in recent months. On Sunday, across the nation, Peruvians will go to the polling booths for the third time in less than a year, this time to vote on a new constitution drawn up by the congress they elected last November. It is the country's first ever referendum. The topic is so complex that, according to polling organisations, only one Peruvian in 10 has any real idea of what he is voting on. The government, while spending substantial sums on advertising, has done little to inform voters - the campaign was reduced to a catchy jingle with the slogan: 'Say Yes to the Peru you love'. If its 1979 predecessor was statist and idealistic, the 1993 constitution is being officially sold as the gateway to modernity. Mr Jaime Yoshiyama, President Alberto Fujimori's vice-president, says it offers 'confidence, security and tranquillity'. A Yes vote, he says, is a vote for 'the clear path towards prosperity'. In the event, the new constitution, backed by Mr Fujimori's ruling alliance and a handful of small opposition parties, seems on course for approval, although by a smaller margin than at first thought. Last minute opinion polls - which by law cannot be published inside Peru in the two weeks prior to voting - were predicting that more than 40 per cent of all voters would reject it. The No vote seems to have been gathering ground in the past 10 days, in particular in small provincial towns and remote rural areas, precisely the parts which pollsters cannot reliably reach. 'Despite Mr Fujimori's attempts to turn this into a plebiscite rather than a referendum, Peruvians are not seeing it that way,' says Mr Alfredo Torres, of the Lima-based research and polling organisation Apoyo. 'Many people who broadly support Mr Fujimori are going to vote No, especially at the lower income levels.' The No campaign has been a makeshift affair. Bereft of financing and a key figure to lead it, the campaign has nevertheless managed to focus attention on certain specific constitutional articles. The issues which have aroused most popular opposition are the elimination of 'labour stability' - a long-cherished article of faith with the Peruvian workforce - and the threat to free education for all (though proposed changes will affect only the better-off and those at university level). In fact, the bulk of the 'new' constitution remains identical to its predecessor. Constitutional expert Mr Domingo Garcia Belaunde calculates that 60 per cent is unchanged, 30 per cent has been 'fine-tuned' and only 10 per cent is genuinely new. Several of these innovations enjoy wide popular backing: the introduction of the death penalty for convicted high-ranking terrorists commands the support of most Peruvians, as does the modification which allows a serving president to run for an immediate second term. Less popular, but also less emotionally charged, are changes in the mechanisms of governance. If the new constitution is approved, Peruvians will in future elect a single chamber congress of 120 members instead of the traditional two-house, 240-member parliament. And, at local level, the 12 large and semi-autonomous regions formed at the end of the Alan Garcia government will be eliminated. The upshot is that post-referendum Peru will be even more centralist than before. And this despite Mr Fujimori's pledge in May 1992 to the Organisation of American States (OAS) that he would instal a 'genuine' democracy in Peru in place of the 'partidocracy' that has traditionally governed. In a series of advertisements in local papers this week, the Lima-based Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD), headed by former presidential adviser Mr Hernando de Soto, has criticised Mr Fujimori for going back on his pledge. 'This constitution . . . has been drawn up without any popular participation, by congressmen chosen by their party machines and who ran in single, closed lists,' the ILD says. 'This is not a real referendum . . . (but) a plebiscite.' Peru's new constitution will also enhance the already sweeping powers of the executive. The president will be able to dissolve congress in the face of 'grave conflict' between executive and legislature. And he will no longer have to secure congressional ratification for the ambassadors and senior military officers he appoints. Mr Fujimori argues these constitutional modifications actually redress the balance of power, which had previously been weighted in favour of the legislative branch. He says he expects a 'resounding' success in Sunday's poll - resounding, in his view being a 70-30 vote in favour. In the run-up to the poll on Sunday, some resilient bands of Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas were doing their best to put a damper on official optimism, with bombings and selective killings in Lima and the provinces. But all the indications were that Mr Fujimori would safely clear the last hurdle on his long road back to legitimacy.</p>

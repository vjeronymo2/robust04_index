			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Lautro fines life group Pounds 80,000 LIBERTY LIFE, the life assurance group, has been fined Pounds 80,000 by Lautro, the life assurance regulator, for failing to screen its sales staff adequately before recruiting them, John Authers writes. Lautro also said Liberty Life failed to control its internal affairs responsibly, and that it did not ensure its sales force was properly supervised. Liberty Life stopped recruiting sales staff for three months in mid 1992 to demonstrate to Lautro that its screening procedures had been reviewed. The company has only 408 representatives compared with a high of about 750 at the beginning of the decade. It has paid Pounds 5,000 compensation to 46 investors who were sold the wrong products. Mr David Pritchard, sales director of Liberty Life, said: 'We were very successful recruiting but that overswamped our personnel department.' It was right of Lautro to tighten up standards, he added. Mr Pritchard admitted that previously the company had not checked the financial background of its recruits as thoroughly as it should have done. The fine is the latest in a series of penalties imposed on life groups for inadequate control of separately managed tied agents. London &amp; Manchester was fined Pounds 80,000, Guardian Royal Exchange had to pay Pounds 100,000 and Scottish Widows was fined Pounds 120,000.</p>

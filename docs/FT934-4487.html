			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Fewer good men in the line of fire: Defence cuts have stopped just short of reducing the range of the UK's capabilities The billboard featured a tough-looking squad of soldiers and purported to be announcing plans for privatising the British army. What it was actually advertising was a well-known lager. It must have seemed a good joke at the time. If there was one thing that could never be privatised, it was the army. But that was five years ago. Since that spoof advertisement appeared, bits of armed forces activity have been transferred to the private sector. Go to an army base in mainland Britain, and you will no longer find mess meals being cooked, served and cleared up by the Army Catering Corps, but by civilians. Join the RAF or navy as a novice pilot and you will be initiated in flying by a civilian instructor on an aircraft owned and operated by a private-sector company. More is to come. Many military vehicles and other equipment will not in future belong to the forces but be leased from contractors. Forces' married quarters will be hived off on a long lease to a private-sector housing trust. Training, transport, distribution, spares and storage may increasingly be looked after by private companies. Already radically shaken up under the government's 1990 Options for Change defence reforms, the forces' support branches are set to be shaken up again in the quest for economies. Defence planners are searching for ways to absorb a fresh and unwelcome series of spending cuts without damaging the forces' fighting strength. The forces have not yet got over Options for Change. For instance, 80 per cent of armoured regiments have either just amalgamated or are now doing so. But pressure on the Pounds 23.5bn annual defence budget has kept increasing. Defence spending is now 16 per cent lower in real terms than in the mid-1980s. A further 12 per cent reduction in real terms is planned by 1996-97. The biggest cut comes at the end of the three-year budget cycle. The Pounds 22.7bn now planned for 1996-97 is reckoned to be Pounds 1bn less than the MoD had been counting on in its own confidential plans. This seriously alters the assumptions military planners must use for subsequent years. MoD officials who have spent three months drawing up long-term costings for the next 15 years must now redo their sums. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, argued long and hard with the Treasury over this delayed-action spending curb, while Tory backbenchers dug themselves in to resist further cuts in frontline combat units. Rising bitterness in the forces, already reduced in numbers from 320,000 a decade ago to 270,000 and on course to shrink to about 230,000 in the late 1990s, broke into the open last month when Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon, chief of the air staff, sounded off about a 'disreputable campaign' being waged against the services. He and the other service chiefs twice made use of their prerogative to see the prime minister directly, in late September and again in October. Senior officers described it as the most difficult public expenditure round they could remember. The MoD had carefully laid its defences. Its annual white paper in July listed 50 tasks the forces were being asked to fulfil in defence of the UK and its dependencies, in Nato or in support of wider British interests such as peacekeeping. Numbers of battalions, ships and air squadrons were neatly assigned to each military role. In many cases military units were earmarked for two or more roles at once. Almost all the overseas tasks could be done by drawing on the forces provided for UK and Nato defences. The exercise was meant to challenge the Treasury. The implicit message was that, if big savings were wanted, it would mean scaling down or abandoning one or more commitments. Which - apart from peripheral commitments such as Belize, where the British garrison is being withdrawn - would the government be prepared to drop? But Mr Rifkind's cabinet colleagues declined the challenge. According to an MoD planner, defence policy is not at issue. The question is whether it has to cost so much. 'It is clear,' he says, 'that the centre of government does not believe in the efficiency of the MoD as an organisation.' The result will be what senior officers describe as 'another massive trimming exercise' - an attempt to do the same job on reduced means. But if funds continue to be squeezed year by year, as seems likely, Britain's broad-ranging defence effort risks becoming increasingly difficult to sustain. The defence cuts so far have not reduced the range of military capabilities. One exception is the RAF's sub-strategic nuclear capability, which it is due to lose once its current bombs become obsolete. A new missile programme was formally abandoned last month, saving Pounds 1.8bn from the MoD's long-term budget provisions. Instead, Trident submarines, carrying limited numbers of warheads, will be the UK's all-purpose nuclear deterrent. But the array of conventional capabilities, from armoured warfare to strategic reconnaissance, is untouched. Choosing between them would inevitably stir controversy since it would mean favouring one service over another. To avoid the kind of political storm that blew up over the future of infantry battalions, the MoD aims to avoid any further loss of combat units. But there will be more base reductions and closures, and numerous equipment programmes are likely be curtailed, delayed or downgraded. A number of important procurement decisions have been held up by this year's budget arguments. Some - the purchase of more Challenger 2 tanks, minehunters and RAF support helicopters - have now got the go-ahead. But others, including new Sea Harrier jets, an overdue production order for torpedoes and bidding for the first of two new assault ships, are still pending. Back-up support for the services will now undergo close scrutiny in order to concentrate manpower and effort on the front line. Mr Rifkind has said the changes will have to be radical to achieve adequate savings. This is likely to mean transferring some activities outside the services and merging others on a joint-service basis. Munitions maintenance, for instance, is being rationalised, with the navy taking the main responsibility for sophisticated weapons and the army for basic ammunition. But in other areas the three services stand apart. Each has its doctors, dentists, educators and lawyers. 'The only thing we've managed to amalgamate in 10 years,' says a senior officer at MoD headquarters, 'is dog training.' But other officers believe the real opportunities are limited, since the services are distinct and usually at some distance from each other. 'Joint training in everything would be irrelevant and probably a waste of time,' says one. In any event, few of these measures promise to bring short-term savings. The temptation will be to cut training activity and 'consumables' such as fuel and ammunition. This goes down badly with service chiefs. It may cost an extra Pounds 500,000 to send a large unit to train overseas, say officers. But if British forces are to play a worldwide role, such training is 'absolutely vital'. Some symbols of that reputation are already showing the signs of hard times. There are fewer bands and smaller guards of honour for state visits. Foot guards lining the streets on ceremonial occasions now stand nine feet apart instead of six. 'We're having to spread people a bit more thinly,' says the army. Among the victims of the latest cuts will almost certainly be the 40-year-old Royal Yacht Britannia. Paid for out of the defence budget, it will have to go - unless the Queen finds the means to defray its Pounds 12.5m annual costs, or industry takes it over to promote Britain's image overseas. We may not have the Carling British Army, but could we be soon be cheering the Whitbread Royal Yacht?</p>

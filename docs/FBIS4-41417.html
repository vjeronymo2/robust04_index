			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by R.S. under the "In Brief" rubric: "5 Percent of </F> Required Amount Earmarked for Conversion So Far"]    [Text] On 21 June at the State Committee for the Defense  Industry [Gosoboronprom] a meeting took place of participants in  the trilateral commission that early this year produced and  signed the first tariff agreement regulating relations between  the employers, in the shape of Gosoboronprom, trade unions in  defense industry sectors, and the government, as represented by  the Ministry of Labor. It had to be held because of the  disastrous situation with regard to implementing the main points  of the agreement. In particular, the state has not paid its  debt of 441 billion rubles [R] for military equipment produced  as part of the 1993 defense order.    The situation is made considerably worse by the fact that  now, when the 1995 state defense order is nearly a fifth of last  year's, there have also been considerable cuts in the funds  earmarked for military conversion. Out of the R4.7 trillion  required this year to carry through conversion programs, as  little as R0.25 trillion was appropriated in the first quarter  -- slightly more than 5 percent of the intended sum. The  funding of research and development on weapons and military  hardware was not indexed in the first six months, although this  is enshrined in the tariff agreement and is on the whole being  done in Russia's national economy.    The main reason for the failure to act on the tariff  agreement provisions noted by virtually all participants in the  meeting lies in the current structure of the draft Russian  budget being discussed in the State Duma. The main culprit in  the prevailing situation, trade unions in defense sectors think,  is the Russian Government, which is not living up to its  pledges. This will soon provoke heightened social tension in  the regions where the main defense enterprises are located, the  Gosoboronprom press service says.</p>

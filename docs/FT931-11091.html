			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Letter: Nuclear the cheapest energy in France Sir, In his Personal View (January 29), Mr Malcolm Bruce mentions 'subsidised French electricity'. Such an allegation is wrong. Every two years a thorough assessment of the nuclear energy costs is done by a group of experts from various fields of expertise: oil, gas and coal producers, power generators and equipment manufacturers, representatives of Electricite de France and civil servants as well. The conclusions drawn from their studies have proved to be consistent with the ones obtained by experts from the most recognised international bodies such as the OECD. Its last report, entitled Reference Costs, which has recently been published, clearly shows that in France nuclear-fuelled electricity is, for load-based periods longer than 4,000 hours a year (ie, for half of the year), still the most efficient and cheapest source of energy. Such a conclusion remains valid even under contrasting scenarios concerning the prices of primary fuels, strong currency exchange rates and discount rate fluctuations. The present cost of French nuclear electricity, between 20 and 22 cents a kilowatt/hour, includes all the costs derived from the entire nuclear process, particularly the reprocessing and storage of nuclear waste and the decommissioning of obsolete plants. All such costs are, under very conservative hypotheses, integrated into the nuclear kilowatt/hour final cost. Electricite de France, which operates our electro-nuclear programmes without any subsidy, is a profit-making company though. Its operating profits will amount to about FFr3bn (Pounds 360m) for 1992.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Anatolyevich Pashin, department head </F> in State Legal Directorate of RF Presidential Administration, by  Leonid Sharov; date and place not given: "Sergey Pashin: `Trial  by Jury Is Not a Show, but a New Philosophy'"]    [Text] Whether we like it or not, jury trials are  back in Russia. Attorneys, predictably, were immediately divided  into passionate supporters or imperturbable opponents of the  restored legal institution. After Igor Tsykunov's article "Jury  Performance for Foreigners" was published in OBSHCHAYA GAZETA,  No. 14/39 of 8-14 April, describing the first jury trial in  Ryazan, people were irritated. It seemed to be just another  campaign: First they came up with non-alcoholic weddings and now  they are promoting jury trials. It is easy and safe to reject  the new and unfamiliar (even when it did exist in the  long-forgotten past), but paving the way for it, especially at a  time of pervasive legal nihilism, is a different matter....    That is why we interviewed one of the "pavers"--Sergey  Pashin, department head in the State Legal Directorate of the RF  president's administration.    [Sharov] Sergey Anatolyevich, it seems there has been enough  criticism of the State Legal Directorate for the restoration of  the jury trial....    [Pashin] More than enough. Furthermore, many of our  opponents  are doing this because of what might be called a historical  bias. When they argue the inadvisability of juries, they make  references to the trial of Vera Zasulich, who fired a gun at a  tsarist official and was acquitted by a jury, and to Katyusha  Maslova. The most erudite are also invoking the "Brothers  Karamazov." Let us take a look, however, at the history of the  Soviet courts. We could spend months recalling the unjust,  immoral, and illegal verdicts of our judges. This was a system  of injustice! It administered revenge. It was a conveyor belt.  It killed people--and these were real people, not fictional  characters.    [Sharov] How is a jury trial better than a conventional  trial?    [Pashin] The jury is not encumbered by bureaucratic  duplicity. Anything can be written down on paper: the  presumption of innocence, adversary procedure.... But what is  the reality? The conveyor belt I mentioned. The defense of  strictly corporate interests. Who administers justice in our  country? It is a bureaucrat! One of the fundamental principles  of his existence is that one hand washes the other. The opinion  of the procurator is much more important to a judge than the  opinion of the accused. Here is what we always hear in the  courts: Why are you so concerned about the guilty party! You  see, the defendant is referred to as the guilty party. I know  one judge who has been on the bench for 18 years and who was so  surprised when she was told that there are no guilty parties in  a trial court. After all, a person is guilty only after the  verdict acquires legal force. Our procurator does not have to  show up in court to support criminal charges. Many cases are  tried in his absence. Then the functions of the procurator are  assumed by the judge, usually involuntarily, but sometimes even  by choice. Is this done in the interest of justice? If not, then  what interests does it serve? It keeps the conveyor belt running  smoothly. In a jury trial the procurator does not simply press  charges; he has to prove the accusation. There were complaints  after the very first trial by jury in Saratov and after the  Ryazan trial with which the readers of OBSHCHAYA GAZETA are  familiar: The punishment for these hardened murderers was too  lenient, people said; they should have been sentenced to much  longer prison terms, if not something worse. What was the reason  for the mitigation of the punishment, and even the acquittal of  the defendant in Ryazan? Why did the jurors arrive at these  verdicts? Because the prosecution's investigators did not  collect enough evidence, and the prosecuting attorneys did not  present enough evidence to the court (take note of this: I did  not say, to the judge). Would you want jurors to arrive at a  guilty verdict on the basis of the "results" of the usual kind  of investigation, basing their conclusions on a haphazardly  prepared case?    [Sharov] Wait a minute. Are you suggesting that jury trials  will change the accepted system of proof in Russia?    [Pashin] They will not change it, but they will introduce  legal principles into the system. This will take the place of  the notorious expediency we once had. Verdicts should be the  logical result of the evidence presented.    [Sharov] Yes, you could say that there is not much adherence  to logic in our investigative agencies. The procuracy and the  Ministry of Internal Affairs with its counterintelligence  service will be facing a dilemma. It would not be an  exaggeration to say that all kinds of mistakes, inconsistencies,  and omissions can easily be found in ANY criminal  case.    [Pashin] It is not surprising that one of our chief  opponents  was Stepankov, the former procurator general. He expressed his  fears: If the poor investigating official's signature is in the  wrong place, will a criminal be released for this kind of  inconsequential error? Valentin Georgiyevich was being devious.  He knew that the people who worked for him were not accustomed  to assuming the burden of proof. It is interesting, however,  that this did have an impact. People in the procuracy began to  worry. They began to learn how to base charges on the  accumulated evidence. It is now common practice for the  prosecution to start playing for time when a case is to be tried  by a jury, and to initiate additional investigations of all the  facts of the case.    [Sharov] This is certainly encouraging, but it is not  persuasive enough. After all, it will delay trials. People will  be kept in custody longer and they will be miserable.    [Pashin] Would you try to blame this on jury trials too?    [Sharov] No, but I do believe that for everything good,  there  is also the "other side of the coin." Here is one of the main  objections: You have launched an experiment for completely noble  and ethical reasons, but is it right to experiment with  justice--in the ideal sense of the term? The jury trial is a  government institution in only five oblasts of Russia....    [Pashin] In nine now.    [Sharov] But this still suggests that the inhabitants of  other regions are second-class citizens. They do not have access  to the more humane form of proceedings.    [Pashin] Let us begin with the fact that the jury trial is a  constitutional institution. Therefore, it is not an experiment,  but a sequential fulfillment of the requirements of the Basic  Law. Furthermore, in tsarist Russia jury trials were also  instituted gradually, in one province at a time. Even then, not  all of Russia was "entranced" by them. By the way, the  institution of this form of legal proceedings is not possible in  all regions even today. After all, we have to take ethnic,  historical, traditional, and cultural factors into account. The  simplest thing would be to announce that jury trials will be  instituted everywhere tomorrow. The idea would be completely  discredited. There would be overt violations of the principle.  Our judges, our procurators, and our public defenders are people  from the past, whether we like it or not. Their mentality was  not shaped by current events. They have seen jury trials only in  foreign films, but they learned the law from books in which  trial by jury was reviled in the most vehement terms. That is  why regional judicial authorities were simply asked to consider  the new form of trial. I cannot deny that the regions which  decided to institute jury trials expected some kind of bonus in  connection with this, and we gave it to them as a reward. If the  Ryazan judicial officials, as OBSHCHAYA GAZETA reported,  received the magnificent Catherine Palace in place of their old  shack for the institution of jury trials, more power to them!  This is certainly a change for the better. Finally, I agree that  people in different oblasts are not on an equal level, but it  would have been much more immoral not to institute jury trials  at all.    [Sharov] Another significant objection concerns the high  cost  of jury trials.    [Pashin] Yes, they cost money. For some reason, people  believe that the judicial system is the only sphere of  government activity that entails only expenditures. This is not  true. Courts generate revenue by charging fees and court costs  and by confiscating property. If even one-third of this income  could be used for the maintenance of the courts, we might have a  different judicial system, but everything goes into the budget.  Anything deposited in the budget disappears, and subsequent  allocations are minuscule. This gives rise to the "seditious"  idea that the outrageous sums the government is spending on the  renovation of the White House would be more than enough for the  organization of jury trials everywhere. What more can I say?  Cheap justice is...cheap justice.    [Sharov] But trial by jury is also a complicated process.  Just assembling the right number of people, providing them with  hotel accommodations, arranging for the selection of jurors,  explaining all of their obligations and rights to them,  answering their questions about legal matters.... Then you have  to wait for them to arrive at a verdict. I will repeat the  opinion you "deplored": There will be even longer delays in the  administration of justice. There will be a long list of people  choosing trial by jury. These people will have to remain in  custody for years, waiting and waiting for their trials....    [Pashin] All of that is true up to a point. Only the  preliminary stages will delay the proceedings slightly: the  selection of the jury, the administration of the oath, the  possibility of challenges, and the explanation of rights and  obligations to the jurors. You know that this will not take  weeks or days, but just an hour and a half or two hours. The  complexity of organizing the trial will force the services  responsible for the normal progression of the proceedings to act  more precisely and efficiently. The prosecution will not send a  case to trial when it is full of holes, but will prepare the  case carefully and conscientiously, in the knowledge that no one  in the court will overlook its errors. If there is the slightest  error, then the defendant will be acquitted. But the prosecution  is bound much more strictly by the judicial calendar and the  maximum terms of confinement for suspects. The unconditional  appearance of witnesses, victims, defense attorneys,  prosecutors, and experts will be the rule in jury trials, and  some will have to be summoned by subpoena because this kind of  "complicated process," as you called it, cannot be jeopardized  by the failure of one or two people to appear in court. There  will also be changes in escort services. The existence of jury  trials will also speed up the resolution of some old problems:  the protection of witnesses and victims, the guaranteed  appearance of witnesses and victims, and the more precise  functioning of escort units. Finally, there will be a new  approach to the choice and use of measures to secure the  appearance of the defendant. In any case, the 20 or so jury  trials which have already taken place proved that local  officials could begin solving these problems in earnest. There  were no insurmountable obstacles.    [Sharov] But these were mainly show trials. There was so  much  publicity, and the press, television reporters, foreigners, and  observers from higher courts were invited to attend. I am afraid  that everything will go back to normal when this becomes routine.    [Pashin] This was not a publicity campaign, but the  customary  monitoring of a fundamentally new practice. In addition, it was  propaganda. It was, you might say, a demonstration. The jury  trial is not simply another form of judicial proceedings; it is  a new level of legal awareness, a new mentality, even a new  philosophy. We want the high standards of work which were  reached in the first months to be maintained in the future and  to become the routine. You object to the theatrical nature of  the jury trial, but I do not see anything terrible about this.  It is certainly a ceremonial proceeding, a ritual with many  obligatory elements; it is only in Russia, which has been  poisoned by legal nihilism, that it is seen as something  superfluous or contrived. Its effectiveness and impact will not  be diminished by the absence of television reporters and  journalists, although I am certain that the latter will attend  trials by jury much more often than ordinary trials. The main  thing is that the proceedings held the interest of all of the  parties involved in the trial--although this might sound cynical  in reference to the accused or the victim. Something they never  even dreamed of 5 or 10 years ago was coming to life before  their very eyes.    [Sharov] Was it interesting for the prosecution?    [Pashin] You can imagine. Although prosecuting attorneys  threatened to protest the jury verdicts after some trials, this  made them look like people who wave their fists after a fight.  The prosecutors felt like attorneys, instead of bureaucratic  pawns making the prescribed moves. The institution of adversary  procedure is a wonderful thing. It forces people to think. It  involves professional risks. It was the same for the public  defenders. They finally saw a way to get around the wall they  kept running into at almost every trial in the past. The judge  felt like an arbiter, and not a worker on an assembly line. Here  it is, the new mentality we wanted. This, quite honestly, makes  the job worthwhile. And just look at what happened: Igor  Tsykunov's article objectively "promoted" the jury trial,  because the observant reader will see that the trial in Ryazan  acted like a searchlight, illuminating the true features of our  wretched system of justice and revealing the road to improvement.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [No dateline as received] Recently President  Nursultan Nazarbayev has adopted two important decrees which  will play an important role in facilitating the land reform: "On  Certain Issues Related to Regulation of Land Relations" and "On  Further Facilitation of Land Relations." A KAZTAG correspondent  interviewed Bakhyt Ospanov, chairman of the state republican  committee for land and land tenure. [passage omitted]    The Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic has approved the  average assessed value on the right to use or lease land. In  Almaty, for example, one square meter is estimated at 50 tenge,  in Karaganda -- 13.4, in settlements -- 1.3, in farms -- 0.7  tenge per square meter. In Almaty Oblast the estimated value of  one square meter of land comprises half of its cost in the  capital. The territorial branches (regional and city  committees) of the state committee for land and land tenure are  allowed to increase or lower (maximum by a factor of two) the  estimated value on the right to use or lease land depending on  the infrastructure. The committee is also invested with the  power of specifying and (?changing) if need be the estimated  value depending on the data on a quarterly index of prices,  provided by the state committee for state statistics.    The president's first decree establishes that citizens which  fall under clause 16 of the law "On Citizenship in the Republic  of Kazakhstan" have the right to obtain an allotment for  lifelong inherited possession irrespective of the duration of  their residence on the territory of Kazakhstan.    [Correspondent] Are you talking here about those  Kazakhstanis  who have special merits before the Republic and those people who  have been forced to leave the Republic for political reasons as  well as their descendants, who decided to come back to their  historic motherland for permanent residence?    [Ospanov] Yes, the president considered it necessary to lift  the earlier temporary ban and give the right to those citizens  of Kazakhstan who have spent not less than five years in the  republic to acquire an allotment for lifelong inherited  possession. There are 3.2 million landowners with the right to  a lifelong inherited possession in the Republic, including  16,000 farms. [passage omitted].</p>

Shehu Musa Yar'adua was freed on Wednesday [16 February], but a  suit against his detention is going ahead in a Kaduna high court  in northern Nigeria.    Yar'adua, who was number two in the 1976-79 military  government of Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, was arrested last weekend  in his home town of Kaduna, on his return from a foreign trip.  There has not been any official statement on his detention,  believed to be connected with his press conference 12 January in  Lagos, asking the Gen. Sani Abacha government to hand over power  by December this year. In a veiled reference to that press  conference, the police in Lagos on 13 January, warned  politicians against making "inflammatory" statements.    A Kaduna high court began hearing the case against the  government on Wednesday apparently unaware of the general's  release. Yar'adua's lawyer called the detention "unlawful,  illegal and unconstitutional."    Judge Yemi Ibiyeye had refused to grant bail to Yar'adua  saying it would amount to injustice to release him on bail  without hearing from the government. The judge ordered the  government to be served with a motion on notice and fixed  hearing of the case for 28 February. It was unclear what would  become of the case.    Yar'adua, pressed for comments by journalists on Wednesday,  said he would issue a press statement soon. His arrest had  provoked condemnation by human rights and pro-democracy groups.</p>

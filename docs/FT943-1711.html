			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Rasmussen set to hold on to power in Denmark: Exit polls indicate narrow win for coalition The Social Democratic-led Danish government of Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen was last night set to remain in office despite a strong performance by the rightwing opposition Liberal party in the general election, according to exit polls on Danish television. The two polls indicated Mr Rasmussen's four-party coalition would lose its one-seat majority in the Folketing (parliament), slipping from 91 seats to 80. But it would still be strong enough to stay in power with the backing of the leftwing Socialist People's party which was predicted to hold up to 14 seats. Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen's Liberal party was set to achieve the greatest gains. The polls indicated it would increase its representation from 29 seats to about 40, overtaking the Conservative party as the second biggest party after the Social Democrats. Mr Rasmussen's Social Democrats were seen losing eight or nine of the 69 seats they won in the last election in 1990. But the combined strength of the Liberals and Conservatives, and their rightwing ally, the Progress party, still only amounted to about 76 seats, according to the polls, well short of the backing needed to form a government. The polls predicted the Conservatives and the Progress party would each lose several seats. A new entry to the Folketing was set to be the Unity List, an extreme leftwing and anti-European Union party, which could win up to six seats. The Social Democrats came to power, after 10 years in opposition, without an election in January 1993 when a Conservative-led government, headed by Mr Poul Schluter, resigned in a scandal over government treatment of Tamil refugees. Three small centre parties - the Radical Liberals, the Centre Democrats and the Christian People's party - switched from supporting Mr Schluter to Mr Rasmussen and have stayed loyal to the prime minister in this election. During the election campaign, Mr Rasmussen said he wanted to spend more on Denmark's already generous welfare system. A decade of budgetary restraint under centre-right governments during the 1980s and early 1990s saw Denmark bring its public finances under control. Although government spending equals 64 per cent of gross domestic product, the budget deficit stands at a 5.5 per cent of gross domestic product. But the high level of government outlays requires Danes to pay more in taxes than any other industrialised country.</p>

Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the  Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said it is  necessary to be vigilant against those who, while making  political troubles in Hong Kong, may create economic disorder  there and hollow out Hong Kong's economy.    When paying a visit to Hong Kong and Macao CPPCC members,  Li,  who is also one of the top seven leaders of the Chinese  Communist Party, said that, in the past decade, Hong Kong and  Macao compatriots have made important contributions to the  mainland's reforms, open policy implementation and economic  development.    Social stability and economic development on the mainland  have provided a reliable guarantee and powerful support for the  prosperity of Hong Kong and Macao. The stability and prosperity  of Hong Kong and Macao are linked closely with those on the  mainland. The relationship has become more and more apparent  with the approach of the date for sovereignty transfer, he said.    Continuously maintaining the stability and prosperity of  Hong  Kong and Macao is not only an issue of political principle but  also an issue of the economic interests of Hong Kong and Macao  compatriots and of the mainland people.    After China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong  Kong and Macao, the Chinese Government will adhere to the  principle of "one country, two systems" and deal with various  questions of Hong Kong and Macao with a positive and prudent  attitude, he said.    He said that the British side should be held entirely  responsible for the breakdown of Sino-British talks on the  arrangement of the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong.    He alerted Hong Kong people against robbery of Hong Kong  money in a "modern way." People should pay attention to  economic issues as well as political ones there, he said.    He said that the Hong Kong British authorities, in violation  of an understanding memorandum, have raised the costs of the new  airport to such a high level as to be "rarely seen in the  world." It will impose a huge financial burden on the Government  of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and its people  after 1997, he said.    Questions should be raised, he said, about who get contracts  for the airport project and who will get all the money.    Backed by an increasingly prosperous motherland, and through  the concerted efforts of Hong Kong people, Li said, Hong Kong is  certain to have a bright future.</p>

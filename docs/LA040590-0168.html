			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> A PASTOR'S $20-MILLION LAST HURRAH;  </P> <P> TRANSFORMATION: THE PUSH IS ON TO INCREASE MEMBERSHIP IN ONE OF THE LARGEST  PROTESTANT CHURCHES IN LOS ANGELES, AS IT RELOCATES TO CHATSWORTH.  </P> <P> The Rev. Jess Moody slumped in his chair, his usually upbeat demeanor  momentarily dragged down by the strain that goes with trying to set new roots  for a congregation that, until last year, had stayed put for nearly four  decades.  </P> <P> Membership is dramatically down and it's no small task to establish a new  identity for his congregation -- even for one that once was among the largest  Protestant churches in Los Angeles -- now that it has changed its name from  First Baptist Church of Van Nuys to Shepherd of the Hills, he allowed.  </P> <P> Moreover, construction of a planned new church complex in Chatsworth is nearly  a year behind schedule and the man he thought might one day succeed him as  pastor has stepped aside, a victim of burnout.  </P> <P> "This is a precarious time in the church's history," Moody said, a certain  weariness evident in his voice. "You know, this is probably my last hurrah. I'm  64 years old and I'm trying to make it happen one more time."  </P> <P> Moody, however, is not one to dwell on the negative. Without missing a beat,  the Texas-born pastor with a penchant for building large churches sat upright,  and in a voice turned strong, launched into a discourse on his plans.  </P> <P> "Look at that," he said, pointing to a large aerial photograph of the west San  Fernando Valley that graces a lobby wall outside his church office. "A million  people live west of the 405. That's two Fort Worths!  </P> <P> "People tell me we've got the best site for a new church in all of Los Angeles,  maybe even in America."  </P> <P> Moving a long established congregation is hard enough. Long-time members tend  to be upset by the move and many can be counted on to drop out, noted C. Peter  Wagner, a church growth specialist at Pasadena's Fuller Theological Seminary.  At Shepherd of the Hills, membership has dropped by almost 3,000 while Moody  tried to move the congregation over the last few years.  </P> <P> What makes Moody's move doubly difficult is the emphasis on reaching the  "unchurched" that Shepherd of the Hills has claimed as its mission. Rather than  trying to lure new members from existing West Valley churches or limiting  himself to keeping his old congregation intact, the people Moody said he wants  are the ones who profess to have no interest in going to church.  </P> <P> "I'm looking for people who don't have a Bible in their homes or any time for  it," Moody said with characteristic flair. "But it ain't my style to go around  with halitosis breath grabbing people. If we create interest, people will  come."  </P> <P> The site Moody has bet his congregation's future on is a 14-acre plot boasting  a third of a mile of Simi Valley Freeway frontage between Corbin and Winnetka  avenues adjacent to the massive Porter Ranch development. Grading is under way  and Moody hopes that the first phase of the $20-million relocation project will  be completed by late fall.  </P> <P> For the time being, though, Shepherd of the Hills' home is 17,500 square feet  of space in two Chatsworth industrial buildings across the street from each  other and about three miles from the freeway site. Since January, Sunday  services have been conducted at nearby Chatsworth High School or at the Mason  Park Recreation Center. An outdoor service is, however, planned for the new  site on Easter Sunday.  </P> <P> When Moody describes the plans for the new church complex, the one-time college  radio sports announcer sounds almost as if he is describing a country club. The  first building to be constructed will be a $6-million, 65,000-square-foot  structure that will contain a 1,900-seat auditorium and several classrooms and  offices, plus a full-scale health club open to non-church members as well, he  said.  </P> <P> Plans also call for later construction of a half-mile jogging trail complete  with a par exercise course, a 400-seat theater for cultural events and  lectures, and a 3,100-seat sanctuary in a building with a wrap-around wooden  deck, adjacent man-made lake and indoor and outdoor baptisterys.  </P> <P> In an effort to have a "universalist appeal," not a single cross,  Christianity's principal symbol, is planned for any of the building exteriors.  </P> <P> And everything, Moody insisted, will have "a Connecticut farmhouse-feel to it,"  even down to the proverbial white picket fence.  </P> <P> "We're trying to avoid traditional symbols that may turn some people off," he  said. "What we will have will say to people that we're relaxed about life.  Today, we have too many churches that are against everything, including  breathing. The people on the outside hate them."  </P> <P> Attracting "church outsiders" has long been Moody's focus. After earning a  doctorate in theology, he served as pastor of a Southern Baptist church in  Owensboro, Ky., then moved on to another in West Palm Beach, Fla. It was there  that he first made his mark.  </P> <P> Under his direction, the church grew to 6,000 members. He founded Palm Beach  Atlantic College, created a 25-station church television network and became a  nationally known church figure.  </P> <P> At the same time, though, the network fell more than $300,000 into debt, a debt  that was assumed by First Baptist Church of Van Nuys after Moody arrived in  1976.  </P> <P> First Baptist, which began congregational life in a railroad car in 1914, was,  in its heyday, the preeminent Valley religious institution. Over the years, it  spawned a host of other local churches.  </P> <P> The church relocated to 14800 Sherman Way in the early 1950s, and under the  leadership of the Rev. Harold L. Fickett Jr., became a 12,000-member  mega-church. Fickett resigned in 1975 to assume the presidency of a Christian  college back East.  </P> <P> Almost from the beginning, Moody was in and out of hot water with some members  of his congregation over his attempts to reorganize church administrative  procedures and his desire to affiliate the then-independent church with the  Southern Baptist Convention.  </P> <P> Nearly 300 dissidents broke away and organized Chatsworth's Faith Evangelical  Church, which Fickett later returned to the Valley to pastor.  </P> <P> The Rev. David W. Miller, Faith Evangelical's current pastor, noted a "certain  irony" in Shepherd of the Hills also relocating in Chatsworth, but he said he  welcomes the move.  </P> <P> "There's a half-million unchurched people within 30 minutes of here. There's  plenty of room for a whole lot of churches," said Miller, whose church now  attracts about 2,000 worshipers.  </P> <P> In recent years, Moody has gotten his share of negative publicity. In 1985, he  admitted losing $40,000 in an investment scheme perpetrated by a former church  member. Hundreds of other investors, including many from First Baptist and  Faith Evangelical, also were victimized.  </P> <P> The following year, while trying to secure a new church site, Moody publicly  stated that it was "God's will" that his congregation move to the "promised  land" of the West Valley to keep that area "from Satan's grip."  </P> <P> Moody later said his use of "church language" had been misunderstood.  Nonetheless, his remarks gave Monteria Estates homeowners an additional edge in  their eventually successful fight to keep First Baptist from relocating on 12.5  acres adjacent to the exclusive Chatsworth neighborhood.  </P> <P> A decade of struggle to relocate First Baptist appeared at an end when the  freeway frontage site was acquired and First Foursquare Church of Van Nuys  agreed to purchase First Baptist's 10-acre Sherman Way property for $11  million.  </P> <P> But then First Foursquare scuttled the agreement and an attempt to sell the  land to a commercial developer also fell through. First Foursquare eventually  re-entered the picture, but it cost First Baptist $1 million more to vacate the  property than had been expected.  </P> <P> In the meantime, delays resulting from having to meet a host of city  requirements snowballed at the new church site, postponing the planned move-in  date from late 1989 to late 1990.  </P> <P> All of this took its toll on the Rev. Jim Rives, Moody's right-hand man and the  church's business manager. At 48, Rives has quit the ministry to enter real  estate sales and political fund-raising, although he remains a paid consultant  to Moody and a member of the congregation.  </P> <P> "I sort of thought Jim would some day take my place," Moody said. "But he's  changed his tune."  </P> <P> Rives said, "my job was to take the heat on everything involved with the move  so Jess could remain the pastor. But it started to affect my attitude. I burned  out."  </P> <P> The move has also taken its toll on membership. Rives said "several hundred"  congregants have left the church, which Moody admitted is down to "7,500 names  on the membership roll," a great percentage of whom never attend services.  </P> <P> With membership off, so is church income. "It's a little down, but we're not  breaking our hearts over it. . . . We have plenty of money. It's just in the  members' pockets," Moody said. "We have 1,750 people who are regular givers to  the church. Perhaps 800 tithe 10% of their income," he said.  </P> <P> John Jauregui, a 20-year church member who chairs Shepherd of the Hill's board  of trustees, also insisted that church finances and membership remain strong.  </P> <P> "The Lord has given us a good, solid base. Plus, new people are starting to  show up at services. For a church in transition, that's very good," said the  Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Corp. executive.  </P> <P> However, Herb Hollinger, editor of the California Southern Baptist, the  denomination's state newspaper, noted that "Jess seems real weary. He's had to  fight a lot of battles and he's getting tired. They may not have been ready for  the magnitude of this adjustment."  </P> <P> Still, Hollinger expressed confidence that Moody's latest gamble will pay off.  Wagner, the church growth expert, added that demographically speaking at least,  Moody's plans for Shepherd of the Hills make good sense.  </P> <P> "Churches, like everything else, are in the marketing business as well," Wagner  said. "As American culture changes, the churches that fare best are the ones  that change with the culture."  </P> <P> Moody, Wagner said, is merely following a course pioneered by the Rev. Robert  Schuller, pastor of Garden Grove's highly successful Crystal Cathedral, whose  appeal to suburban baby boomers has garnered him a 10,000-member congregation  and an international reputation.  </P> <P> "It's the baby boomers, young parents in their mid-20s to 40s who respond best  to this style of ministry. Affluent, suburban areas like the West Valley are  full of them," he said.  </P> <P> Wagner also noted it was common for "old-timers" to leave in such circumstances  for more traditional churches. "That's OK. That's just how churches evolve," he  said.  </P> <P> Shepherd of the Hills remains affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention,  the nation's largest Protestant denomination, but one that has been racked with  bitter in-fighting in recent years between fundamentalists and moderates. Both  factions generally consider the Bible to be the inerrant word of God; however  the moderates, with whom Moody has been aligned, tend to be more accepting of  limited dissent and are socially more liberal.  </P> <P> But there is no hint of this denominational affiliation in the congregation's  new name.  </P> <P> Mark Wyatt, the Fresno-based spokesman for the California Southern Baptist  Convention, noted that "a number" of newer Southern Baptist congregations  around the state have opted not to include the denomination's name in their  congregational name "for strategic reasons."  </P> <P> Doing so, he added, "eliminates one more reason for someone to avoid the  congregation. A lot of people don't want to affiliate with a particular  congregation."  </P> <P> "In California, the name 'Baptist' is a negative. It conjures up images of  Jerry Falwell," Wagner added.  </P> <P> For his part, Moody insisted that the Valley's changing demographics and church  scene left him no alternative but to move to Chatsworth. More than half of  First Baptist's existing congregation -- most of them white and middle class or  upper middle class -- had already moved to the West Valley, he said.  </P> <P> Moreover, in the central Valley he was forced to compete for members with both  Van Nuys First Foursquare and Sun Valley's Grace Community Church, two  fast-growing but decidedly more conservative congregations.  </P> <P> "Just give us a few years," Moody insisted, smiling. "You'll see. We're going  to be the church of the 21st Century in the West Valley."  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: BALANCED FUNDS LOOK BETTER OVER LONG HAUL  </P> <P> Looking at the recent performance of balanced funds and their near cousins, you  can't help but be reminded of the proverbial glass that's either half full or  half empty.  </P> <P> On the one hand, balanced funds -- defensive portfolios that maintain at least  some stock holdings -- have held up much better than equity funds in general  during this difficult year.  </P> <P> But on the other hand, most balanced funds are showing losses for 1990 and will  wind up in the red unless stocks rally strongly during the next seven weeks. If  you bought a balanced portfolio under the notion that it would avoid losing  money, you might be in for a surprise. Several of these funds have stumbled by  more than 10% so far this year.  </P> <P> For the group as a whole, the losses aren't nearly as severe. The average  balanced fund declined 6%, including dividend income, during the first 10  months of the year, according to Lipper Analytical Services. That's not bad  compared to an average 13.8% setback for equity funds. Balanced portfolios  typically hold stocks, bonds and cash, and the latter two components help  cushion any blows. It's not misleading to think of balanced funds as  "all-weather" investments.  </P> <P> In hindsight, you would have been better off this year holding bonds or cash,  of course. That might still be the wisest investment strategy. Walter Rouleau,  editor of the Growth Fund Guide newsletter in Rapid City, S.D., suspects that  stocks will decline even further in the months ahead and thus recommends money  market funds that hold short-term U.S. government debt instruments.  </P> <P> But if you switch to cash, you will eventually have to decide when to get back  into equities. With balanced funds, there's no such decision to make. Because  they maintain at least some stock holdings at all times, they will participate  in any rallies.  </P> <P> In fact, if you're a conservative investor who recognizes that stocks -- unlike  bonds or cash -- tend to beat inflation by a comfortable margin over lengthy  periods, balanced funds might be a wise choice.  </P> <P> "It's difficult to get quite a few people, especially those in their mid-50s  and up, to come back to the stock market at all," says James B. Rea Jr.,  president of the Rea-Graham Balanced Fund, based in West Los Angeles. "This is  a good way to get them to stay with equities over the long haul."  </P> <P> Dick Strong, head of Strong Funds in Milwaukee, believes that the balanced  approach is the wisest choice for smaller investors lacking the money to buy a  lot of funds. He suggests diversifying among three balanced portfolios run by  different firms. "Go with the three best management companies you can find."  </P> <P> Following that advice should lead to even less volatility and more consistent  returns than a single portfolio can deliver. For although balanced fund  managers are a conservative lot, they don't necessarily share similar market  outlooks.  </P> <P> For example, Strong has a decidedly bearish lean at the moment. He's concerned  about a sluggish economy, negative inflation-adjusted growth in the money  supply and sickness in the banking sector. "Banks serve as the heart in terms  of the flow of money in the system. If there's a heart attack, that would lead  to other problems." Strong says he would grow more optimistic if bank stocks,  badly battered of late, showed signs of firming.  </P> <P> By contrast, Rea has turned cautiously optimistic. "The current bear market is  already a year old. We think now might be the time to buy." Since late August,  Rea-Graham Balanced's common stock weighting has increased to 32% from 26%,  with cash and a few bonds composing the remainder. But just in case this  bullishness is unwarranted, the fund maintains a decidedly risk-averse posture;  its stock holdings sell at an average price/earnings ratio of just 7.  </P> <P> Of course, balanced funds aren't the only low-risk equity selections available.  Here's a look at some of the other categories that fit an all-weather  description:  </P> <P> * Asset allocation. These funds typically hold more than just equities, bonds  and cash. For example, USAA Cornerstone, run by USAA Investment Management of  San Antonio, maintains roughly equal weightings in gold stocks, foreign stocks,  government bonds, real estate stocks and "basic value" shares. Rouleau likes  this fund but says it has been bogged down by the gold holdings. Cornerstone  gained at least 8% annually each year from 1985 through 1989, but it dropped  13% through Oct. 31 of this year.  </P> <P> * Income. Funds in this group are generally more conservative than their  balanced cousins, simply because they focus more on bonds and less on stocks.  According to Morningstar Inc. of Chicago, the average income portfolio has 52%  of its assets in bonds, 30% in stocks and 11% in cash. For balanced funds, the  numbers are: stocks 50%, bonds 32% and cash 13%.  </P> <P> * Utility. Funds that focus on utility stocks and, to a lesser extent, bonds  often hold up well during broad market declines. That's because electric and  natural gas companies tend to pay big dividends, and that gives their shares a  bondlike resiliency.  </P> <P> But the telecommunications business is another matter. Deregulation, the  explosion of cellular phones and fax machines, and other factors have  transformed once-sedate telephone utilities into growth enterprises. As a  result, phone stocks have become more volatile, as have the funds that buy  them. Fidelity's Select Telecommunications fund, for example, plunged 24%  through Oct. 31 of this year after a 51% gain in 1989. So, when examining a  utility fund, be sure to find out if it's a slow mover or a volatile selection.  </P> <P> The same goes for other types of funds, too. Some growth portfolios, for  example, are remarkably defensive (see chart). That goes to show you can't  always judge a fund by its label.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> ALL WEATHER FUNDS  </P> <P> If you can't stand much risk, you'll want to select mutual funds that give  ground grudgingly. That would eliminate the vast majority of stock-oriented  portfolios, most of which are showing double-digit losses so far in 1990. But  not the funds listed below. None has lost more than 1% in any of the past five  calendar years, and a few have done considerably better.  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.20IN:1.78IN:1.78IN:1.78IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE>

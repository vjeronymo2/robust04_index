			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REP. LUKENS TARGET OF NEW SEXUAL MISCONDUCT CHARGES  </P> <P> The House Ethics Committee on Monday voted to investigate new charges that Rep.  Donald E. (Buz) Lukens (R-Ohio), convicted last year of a sex offense, has  sexually harassed a Capitol employee.  </P> <P> "The committee has received additional evidence indicating that Rep. Lukens may  have made unwanted and unsolicited sexual advances to a congressional  employee," the committee announced.  </P> <P> Sources close to the case said Lukens is suspected of fondling and  propositioning a young elevator operator, giving her his business card. She  reported the incident to her supervisors, and one source said there was a  witness to corroborate her story.  </P> <P> Lukens' office issued this statement in his name: "My attorneys have advised me  that since little or nothing is known about the new allegation, there will be  no comment until we have more information."  </P> <P> Lukens, 59 and divorced, lost in the Republican primary earlier this year and  will be leaving Congress at the end of the year. However, the committee  appeared to be expediting its schedule to take action, ordering Lukens to  appear under oath today.  </P> <P> Lukens was convicted last year of contributing to the unruliness of a minor for  having sex with a 16-year-old girl at his Columbus apartment in 1988. He was  sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined $500 but is free on appeal.  </P> <P> He refused to resign despite pleas from many Ohio Republicans.  </P></p>

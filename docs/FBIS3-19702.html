			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Eberhard Wisdorff: "Playing Tough"] </F>   [Text] The cheering was rather restrained when the foreign  ministers of the European Union [EU] last week came to an  agreement on the conditions for EU membership with Norway and  thus paved the way to the European Union for the fourth  candidate after Sweden, Austria, and Finland. The moderate  satisfaction with the expansion, however, covered up a distrust  between the 12, which has now erupted in several instances.    It may be that, with another attempt this Tuesday [22  March],  the foreign ministers will be able to settle the controversy  with Great Britain and Spain regarding the blocking minority for  votes in the Council. This would not change the fact that,  above all, the British position was aimed at paralyzing the  decisionmaking procedures in the expanded European Union and is  thus once again an expression of continuing hostility toward  integration. It may also be that the acting Council president,  Greek European Affairs Minister Pangalos, primarily thought of  his country's own interests when he called the planned expansion  precipitate. In any case, the quarrel over the voting  procedures has proved those right -- including the Brussels  Commission in the past -- who wanted to link this necessary step  with a further reform of the EU institutions.    The relationship between the size of the European Union and  its politically, urgently necessary ability to act remains  unclear with a view to the future. Because of unclear motives,  London wants expansion at all cost, while, at the same time,  weakening the European Union. Paris is still looking for  composure in view of German unification and the shifting of the  European balance toward the northeast, which goes hand in hand  with expansion and subsequent accessions. In Bonn, the next  expansion of the European Union to Central and East Europe is  being pursued, at least verbally, with every ounce of strength.  At the same time, however, there are more or less open demands  on the partners to ease the burden on Germany as a net payer,  but without any idea who is supposed to pay for the costs of a  speedy expansion toward the east, which are threatening in the  long run.    In this difficult situation and in view of understandable  sensitivity on the French side, German foreign policy headed by  Klaus Kinkel does not have any better idea than to play it tough  at the European level. No matter which statements were really  made in detail and led to the diplomatic conflict in Bonn last  week: Observers of the negotiations in Brussels have long felt  this tone, which expresses self-confidence not through calmness,  mastery, and sensitivity but through obvious loudness.    The expansion of the European Union makes the considerations  about its ability to function, which have been postponed until  1996 by the Maastricht Treaty, all the more urgent. In  particular, because political coincidence has shifted the  weights in the European Union, intensive cooperation between  Germany and France is playing an even greater role. One should  not carelessly gamble away the existing capital.</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Major and Reynolds edge closer to Ulster peace deal Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds last night kept alive the prospect of a pre-Christmas peace initiative designed to persuade the IRA to end its 25-year campaign of violence in Northern Ireland. Despite an admission by the two leaders that their second meeting in a week had failed to surmount remaining obstacles to a joint declaration, they held out the possibility that such a statement could be finalised within the next fews days. Amid conflicting reports of their encounter at the European summit in Brussels, Mr Reynolds was said to have been angered by Mr Major's refusal to move further in the direction of acknowledging the aspirations for a united Ireland of the nationalist community in Ulster. The Irish prime minister was said also to be frustrated at Mr Major's apparent refusal to persuade Unionist leaders that the peace initiative offered no threat to their present status. But both leaders appeared ready to acknowledge that the cost of a breakdown in their negotiations might well be a resumption of uncontrolled violence in Northern Ireland. So in a public statement after their talks, Mr Major and Mr Reynolds said that further progress had been made and that they expected another meeting would be held before Christmas at which they could finalise the declaration. Senior British officials insisted it was still possible the statement could be agreed by Tuesday or Wednesday of next week. The British and Irish prime ministers want the statement to provide a springboard for an intensive round of negotiations on a permanent political settlement in Northern Ireland. More immediately, they hope it will coax the IRA into extending its traditional Christmas ceasefire into a permanent cessation of violence. But the two leaders have yet to find the precise language for the most sensitive passages in the document. They also remain uncertain that the first attempt since the 1985 Anglo - Irish agreement to balance the competing claims of Irish nationalism and Ulster unionism would be enough to restore peace. The joint statement issued after the talks said Mr Major and Mr Reynolds hoped 'to bring the process to a successful conclusion' in the next 10 days. With Mr Major anxious to secure an accord before parliament breaks on Friday for the Christmas recess, one high-ranking British official commented: 'I very much hope we get there. I cannot guarantee that we will get there.' He then added: 'There is still some way to go.' Officials will attempt to iron out the remaining differences during intensive contacts over the next few days, opening the possibility of a final summit in London next week. Anxious to reassure the Ulster Unionists, British officials said the declaration would underwrite its guarantee to the Protestant majority in Northern Ireland that there could be no change in the status of the province without their consent. Mr Major had also won assurances from Mr Reynolds of Dublin's commitment to drop its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland as part of a comprehensive settlement. But Mr Reynolds is determined those assurances to the Unionist majority must be balanced by public recognition of the legitimacy of the nationalist aspiration for a united Ireland.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Political differences are impeding European monetary union (1) Sir, What a dispiriting article by Christopher Johnson ('Still on track for a single currency', August 23). He sees the achievements of the exchange rate mechanism as reducing inflation, giving banks windfall profits during the recession and providing the backdrop to the demolition of trade barriers. His third point perhaps has some merit but I would prefer to attribute the welcome moves to the single market to affluence in the 1980s and political unity. Trade language has stiffened as growth has slowed. It is true that inflation in the European Community - Germany excepted - has been low in recent years, as it has all over the developed world. But I do not accept Mr Johnson's implication that, without the ERM, we would have high inflation in Europe. Inflation in the UK was worsened by the shadowing of the D-Mark, as was the recession by entry into the ERM and the two further years of high interest rates. The deflationary pressure of high real interest rates in a recessionary environment in France, Scandinavia and the Benelux countries, required by the ERM, has been damaging. Mr Johnson's second point is incredible. I am not averse to traders making currency profits, and it was certainly true that the UK banks, in particular, needed profits in order to rebuild balance sheets and prevent monetary growth from stalling. However, I am not sure large random cash transfers into the market from central banks are a rational policy response. A main beneficial medium-term impact of a fixed exchange rate system is competition on inflation rates, yet the policy thrust of Mr Johnson's article is to recommend a move to fixed real exchange rates. It is sad that, after the damage caused by an ERM operating in conditions of world recession and divergent EC economies, one can still read that 'the case for one market, one money is as strong as ever'. Surely it should be clear that, without political union, as in the US, monetary union is neither sustainable nor desirable? R H Campbell 50 Leamington Road Villas London W11 1HT</p>

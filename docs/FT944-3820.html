			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Delors bows out of contest for French presidency Mr Jacques Delors yesterday finally and flatly ruled himself out of the French presidency race, citing personal reasons and his calculation that even if victorious he would not have the parliamentary majority to put his ideas into action. Mr Delors, who has led all other possible presidential candidates in the opinion polls for the past several weeks, said his decision not to contest the election next May was 'irrevocable'. One element of his decision, which he revealed on prime time television last night, was his age of 69 and his desire to take a break after 10 years as European Commission president. The former socialist minister, whose commission term ends in January, claimed that 'if the Socialists can agree on a candidate soon, they still have four months before the election and they have a chance'. But few of his colleagues inside the Socialist party agree with that reasoning and will be disappointed by Mr Delors' decision. The move appears to make it highly probable that France's next president will be a conservative from the ruling centre-right majority that won 80 per cent of seats in the 1993 parliamentary election. That very probability is likely to pull in other candidates from the right, in addition to Mr Jacques Chirac, the mayor of Paris, who has already declared his candidacy, and Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, who is expected to declare next month. Spelling out his political calculation in damning terms for any alternative Socialist standard-bearer, Mr Delors said that if he had run and been elected, he would have had to call fresh parliamentary elections to try to find a workable majority. But he said even combining new elections with the popular issue of reducing the French presidential term from seven to five years, and making the electoral system more proportional to suit the left, 'I would not get a majority for the policies I believe in.' He added: 'I am not cut out to be a do-nothing king with all the power elsewhere.' Seeking to ease the pain of fellow Socialists, he said their 'disappointments of tomorrow would be worse than the regrets of today', if a socialist president were to be blocked in his policies because of a conservative majority. Mr Henri Emmanuelli, head of the Socialist party, said he would convene a party congress in January to select a presidential candidate. Delors: I'm no Socialist miracle worker, Page 2</p>

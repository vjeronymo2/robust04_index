			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Putting the fizz back into soda The relentless search for new ways to package consumer products has taken a new turn with the launch of a revolutionary system intended to put the fizz back into bottled soda water. LMG Fibrenyle, part of the Canadian packaging company Lawson Mardon, has developed a patented system for Coca-Cola Schweppes Beverages which combines the appearance of a glass soda syphon with a 1.5 litre PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottle. Instead of the traditional glass soda syphon, the system is based on a 'petasol', LMG Fibrenyle's pioneering plastic aerosol. The system maintains the fizz until the syphon is empty, unlike the immediate loss of carbonation when a conventional bottle of soda water is opened. The PET container is lighter and safer than glass, and can also hold twice as much liquid. LMG Fibrenyle: UK, 0502 713700.</p>

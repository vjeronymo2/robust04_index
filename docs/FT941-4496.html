			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Forces join S Africa 'homeland' revolt Police and soldiers in the South African black 'homeland' of Bophuthatswana revolted against the government yesterday, joining thousands of jubilant protesters celebrating what they believed was the overthrow of President Lucas Mangope. 'We are free, at last]' shouted one demonstrator outside the campus of the University of Bophuthatswana. Other protesters waving African National Congress flags clambered on to police armoured vehicles to embrace those who only moments before had shot volleys of teargas and rubber bullets into the campus. The president's whereabouts were not known last night, but there were persistent reports that he had fled. It was not clear whether the whole of the homeland's police force and army had switched to the side of the demonstrators. Soldiers and police stood by last night as thousands of protesters looted and set alight to a large shopping complex in the capital Mmabatho, which the demonstrators said was owned by a company in which the president held shares. Looting went on for several hours, with demonstrators carrying out furniture, computer equipment, kitchenware, televisions and clothing. Gunfire filled the streets of the capital last night as protesters celebrated their victory. Earlier in the day there were jubilant scenes as police laid down their arms and invited 'comrades' - young ANC students - to climb on to police and army vehicles, including a water cannon which had been used against students. Police and students went to the South African embassy in Mmabatho to deliver a petition entitled 'police for peace', addressed to Mr Mangope and demanding that he stop using the police as a political force. The petition also included a number of economic demands. There appeared to have been no attempts to take over government buildings, the president's office or the homes of ministers last night, but the whereabouts of ministers were unknown. South African officials said they had been assured by their 'ambassador' in Mmabatho that Mr Mangope would be able to regain control, although this seemed unlikely last night. There were, however, reports that members of the paramilitary Afrikaner Resistance Movement had set off for Bophuthatswana from a nearby town, to assist their right wing ally Mr Mangope. If the president has indeed fallen, this would represent a blow to the efforts of the right-wing Freedom Alliance to boycott April's all-race elections, though the main partners in the alliance, Inkatha and the Afrikaner Volksfront, yesterday reaffirmed their resistance. Gen Constand Viljoen, Afrikaner Volksfront leader, said negotiations with the ANC would be halted until the ANC recognised the sovereignty of Bophuthatswana - a demand which may have been overtaken by last night's events.</p>

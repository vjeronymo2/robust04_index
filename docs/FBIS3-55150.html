Journalists were told  this by Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich after his  talks with Viktor Chernomyrdin, head of the Russian government.  The Belarusian prime minister believes that this step will make  it possible to avoid military-political polarization in Europe.  In this connection, Vyacheslav Kebich thinks that after  Russia's admission to NATO Belarus may also become a member of  the bloc. He stated that the question of the position of the  two countries in respect of joining NATO will be discussed  during the visit to Moscow next week by Stanislav Shushkevich,  chairman of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet. This was reported by  INTERFAX.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / International Company News: Lebanon stakes future on investors - The country has turned to capital markets Lebanon's struggle for self-renewal after 17 years of devastating civil war marks a new approach to the financing of development in the Middle East. Gone are the days when Lebanon's pressing needs to rebuild its infrastructure could be achieved by funds from generous oil-producing states in the Arab world and sympathetic Western countries. The industrialised world is jittery about recession, and the big Gulf states are pensively examining huge budget deficits as oil prices continue to fall. Donor money is plainly in short supply. As a result, the Lebanese government has been forced to seek alternatives to finance its reconstruction programme, priced at Dollars 14bn in real terms over 10 years. It is asking private investors to buy a stake in Lebanon's future. On November 1, Solidere, a Dollars 1.8bn property company set up to rebuild the centre of Beirut, launched a Dollars 650m Arab equity offering, one of the biggest share issues in the region. A few weeks later, the government announced plans to raise Dollars 300m by issuing Eurobonds to develop the mainly Shi'ite southern suburbs of Beirut, and a road network. Mr Riad Salameh, Lebanon's new central bank governor, said he is confident the Eurobonds will be well received when they are issued in 'the next few weeks'. He expects Lebanon's low foreign debt of around Dollars 800m, or 10.6 per cent of GNP, and the government's 'credibility' to ensure the issue's success. Lebanon has not defaulted on any international loans since the start of the civil war in 1975. In Mr Rafik Hariri, it has a prime minister with a proven track record in business and one of the strongest financial teams in the region. The country also has gold reserves worth around Dollars 3.8bn, although Lebanese law forbids the government from either selling or pledging the asset. Mr Salameh explained that no manager had yet been appointed to arrange the offering, but Merrill Lynch, the US securities house, and Banque Paribas, the French bank, have both been approached. He said the bonds were likely to be priced to yield between 350 and 400 basis points over US treasuries. The governor, who joined the central bank in August from his post as vice-president of Merrill Lynch in Paris, said that under the present climate of international belt-tightening, Lebanon will have to rely on capital markets and equities to finance much of its rehabilitation. 'I think that if the Eurobond issue is successful, then it will be one of the main ways to raise capital for Lebanon. We might have some syndicated loans but would prefer to go to capital markets,' he said. The launch of shares in Solidere appears to have met a strong response. Mr Abdel-Hafiz Mansour, deputy general manager of the company, expects the offer to be oversubscribed. Existing land and property owners of the 165 acre area in the centre of Beirut earmarked for development will be given priority in the allocation of shares. They will be followed in pecking order by Lebanese residents, government institutions, Lebanese expatriates living abroad, and citizens of Arab states who, it is expected, will include many prominent Saudis. A maximum 10 per cent individual stake will ensure no single shareholder can take overall control of the company, and the subscription remains open until January 10. The cash raised will be used to finance the first phase of redevelopment of what used to be Beirut's bustling commercial centre. Mr Salameh explained Lebanon's reconstruction programme - named Horizon 2000  -would be 70 per cent financed by the private sector and 20 per cent by foreign aid and loans. By his estimates, Lebanon will have to borrow Dollars 2.8bn in external finance over the 10-year period 'which is reasonable considering GNP (put at Dollars 7.5bn for 1993 by the central bank) and the economic expansion planned for the next five years,' he said. The rest will come from government revenues and internal borrowing. Donor commitments to date do not exceed Dollars 1.4bn, including Dollars 175m from the World Bank. A Bank-sponsored consultative group meeting planned for December is expected to result in more aid. However, Lebanese officials admit that since the historic agreement signed between the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israel in September, available funds for Middle East development are likely to be pledged to the occupied territories rather than war-torn Lebanon. In the light of this, Mr Hariri's big gamble is that once the reconstruction ball starts rolling, with finance raised by capital markets and donor countries, then Lebanese expatriates holding overseas assets of between Dollars 30bn and Dollars 40bn will keep up the momentum through investment and remittances. In this way, it is likely that market forces will determine the future of Lebanon.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Olivetti chief seeks to allay investor fears Mr Corrado Passera, chief executive of Olivetti, yesterday sought to reassure shareholders and the market about the financial and industrial health of the Italian computer group. His assurances come at the end of a week in which the value of their investment has fallen by almost 10 per cent. Mr Passera replied point by point to market rumours which led to a 5 per cent fall in the share price on Wednesday. Olivetti reports half-year results later this month, and the chief executive said the group expected to be able to confirm earlier forecasts that it would break even at operating level this year. He said revenues had risen by 7 per cent in the first six months. Olivetti's shares were reasonably stable yesterday, slipping slightly to close at L2,115 against an opening price of L2,123. That, however, compares with L2,347 at last Wednesday's close, before Digital Equipment, the troubled US computer company, revealed it had gradually sold its 8 per cent stake in Olivetti on the market during the slack holiday period. Although the two companies are maintaining technological and product links, the announcement was taken as an indication that they had finally abandoned the ambitious partnership set up in 1992. It has also put Olivetti's fragile recovery under the market spotlight. Mr Passera conceded yesterday that Digital's decision to sell 100m shares into a difficult market created an overhang of Olivetti stock, 'which was bound to reflect on the share price'. However, he pointed out that the way in which the shares were quickly swallowed by the market was 'a further demonstration of the strong liquidity of our stock'. Analysts are still puzzled, however, by the delayed reaction to the Digital news, and believe the market may also have taken into account a number of other unsettling elements, including: the personal computer price war in the US. On the same day as the Digital announcement, International Business Machines launched a price-cutting effort in response to Compaq Computer's price reductions. Mr Passera pointed out yesterday that PCs represented only 20 per cent of Olivetti's L8,600bn (Dollars 5.7bn) annual turnover (more than 60 per cent of group sales come from the systems and services activities), and that the average price reduction on PCs was about 12 per cent - 'not far from what we foresaw in our budget and linked to a drop in component prices and to efficiency improvements'. extraordinary losses on share and bond investments. Mr Passera admitted that in 1994 the group's fixed-interest portfolio had suffered a drop in value, and that investments - held to cope with unexpected restructuring costs - would suffer a one-off loss. capital raising. Mr Passera said the group was not expecting to increase its capital to finance investments in Italy's second cellular telephone network by the Omnitel-Pronto Italia joint venture, in which Olivetti is the main shareholder. Last year Olivetti lost L465bn, compared with a net loss of L650bn in 1992, but sales increased for the first time since 1990. At the group's annual shareholder meeting in May, Mr Carlo De Benedetti, chairman, said Olivetti was 'preparing to reap the benefits of a sweeping structural reorganisation'. However, the market's brusque treatment of Olivetti shares this week is a clear indication to Mr De Benedetti of what will happen if he fails to deliver on those promises. He probably feels the market's discontent more than most. In the last week, shares in the De Benedettis' two quoted holding companies  -Cir, Olivetti's biggest shareholder, and Cofide, with a large stake in Cir  -have themselves declined by 10 per cent and 8 per cent respectively. When the market shakes Olivetti, the whole tree trembles.</p>

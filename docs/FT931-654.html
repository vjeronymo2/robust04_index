			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / PLO puts off peace talks decision THE Palestinians will delay a decision on whether to attend the next round of Middle East peace talks until April 8, Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, announced yesterday. Mr Arafat told the Middle East News Agency in Cairo that he would be asking President Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian leader, to explain the Palestinian position when he meets President Bill Clinton in Washington on April 6. Mr Mubarak will visit Germany and Britain this week before heading off to the US. On Saturday he held talks in Cairo with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria in an effort to reach a joint Arab response to the American invitation to resume peace negotiations in Washington on April 20. The foreign ministers of Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt and the PLO also met in Damascus yesterday to consider the US invitation. But Mr Arafat said the PLO executive committee wanted an opportunity to assess the result of current talks in Washington between members of the Palestinian peace talks delegation and US officials before reaching a final decision. The Palestinians have so far declined to accept the US invitation without an assurance from Israel that it will stop mass deportation of people from the occupied territories. The demand stemmed from Israel's deportation of 415 Palestinians on December 17. The Israeli army said it would bar the 750,000 Palestinians living in occupied Gaza from entering Israel for an indefinite period in response to a recent upsurge in Israeli-Arab violence, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. Earlier, military officials said two Palestinians had stabbed to death a Jew and Israeli troops shot dead an Arab in Gaza. It is the second time Gaza has been closed since the deportations in December.</p>

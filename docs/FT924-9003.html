			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Sport: What the big money wants - Sponsorship HER Majesty's Government handing out extra money is not a common sight these days. The announcement this week of an immediate start to Sportsmatch, the pound-for-pound matching of private support of grass-roots sport with public cash, took even sponsorship insiders by surprise. 'We welcome this splendid and slightly unexpected news,' the Duke of Edinburgh, president of the Institute of Sports Sponsorship, responded to junior Heritage minister Robert Key at an ISS lunch. Sportsmatch parallels a highly-successful programme in arts sponsorship. It also offers a useful sticking plaster to the small sports, and the lower levels of large sports, at a time when both structural changes and recession are hitting them hard. 'Many sports that are an exciting and important part of peoples' lives today rely for their existence on sponsorship - this is not the easiest of times,' said ISS chairman Ian Muir, a senior marketing executive with Coca Cola. Economic pressures are immense at both the top and bottom of sport at present. Barclays, the bank most damaged by the property slump, announces it will no longer sponsor the Football League. British Coal turns its back on the traditional coalfields of Rugby League. British Steel concede that it would have liked to pull out of the round the world yacht race it is backing. At the other end of the spectrum the Sports Council reports that local authorities spending around Pounds 230m on sport in 1991-92, are projecting a figure of only Pounds 140m for 1992-3. 'A large number of sports have already approached us for help and we're not sure if we can,' said an SC spokesman. Oddly enough, this is not a shrinking market. RSL, the research leaders in this area, makes the point that allowing for inflation of around 4 per cent, the real spend in UK sports sponsorship will stay at about Pounds 250m for both 1991 and 1992. What is occurring is a massive 'bunching' at the top end of the market. Even disregarding its Pounds 304m Premier League deal from satellite television, rafts of money surround British soccer's top echelons. RSL reports that of Pounds 30m-worth of new deals signed in January-July 1992, Pounds 22.6m related to kit deals with three soccer clubs: Aberdeen, Rangers and Manchester United. 'These new kit deals, particularly in soccer, have now become so large, that they will now be noted separately when market figures are estimated,' notes RSL drily. An example of the inflationary pressures in this sector is the Liverpool strip. Candy paid around Pounds 300,000 last season for players to advertise its wares. Carlsberg, the new shirt-sponsor, now pays over Pounds 1m. Golf is proving similarly recession-resistant. Prize money of Pounds 25m is likely to be on offer on next year's Volvo European Tour, an increase of around Pounds 2m on this year. In 1992 even players ranked below 50 in the Order of Merit were winning over Pounds 100,000 in prize money. The key to this is the explosion of sport on television, particularly satellite. For the big sponsors with consumer brands the line between advertising and sponsoring is increasingly blurred. Turning a soccer player into a moving billboard is good value if millions of people watch the game. According to motor racing correspondent Norman Howell, the key reason why Formula One is able to soak up Pounds 1 of every Pounds 3 spent in sports sponsorships - a staggering total of over Pounds 82.5m - is that it is still cheap. 'The companies simply divide what they spend by a worldwide viewing audience of billions,' observed Howell. 'If you have a global brand it is still cheaper than most other forms of advertising.' However, most sports do not get on television. Or if they do they do so only rarely. According to Sports Marketing Surveys, badminton, an increasingly-popular participation sport got a total of 35 minutes airtime during 1991: 0.02 per cent of all sport broadcast on terrestrial channels in the UK. The economic terror of not being on television causes some odd situations. Today England's netball team plays New Zealand at Wembley Arena. In the netball world it is the equivalent of the Cup Final and will be broadcast live on BBC and in New Zealand. However, the All England Netball Association could not find a sponsor for the three-match series and faces a Pounds 12,000 bill for production costs involved in broadcasting the second and third games. All second-tier sports are engaged in increasingly frenetic quadrilles to make sure that they get some portion of their activities on television. In London this week the annual conference of the International Yacht Racing Union has been far more involved with desperate attempts to modify Olympic sailing with an eye to TV, than with the more usual fare of port v starboard and pink gins. Yet television is turning its face away from these smaller sports; professional in attitude and healthy in numbers, if not in finance. What technology now permits, and an international electronic swapshop makes possible, is to see the best, day or night, wherever in the world they are performing. But, and it is a big but, the best will be those performers in sports with a huge spectator base. 'The big well-established events in the major sports are still selling their sponsorships at or near the asking price,' said John Taylor, a partner in Taylor Craigie International and the man who brought Canon into soccer. 'But grass-roots sports sponsorship is an absolute nightmare. Impossible to sell.'</p>

			<p>Using   Bacteria   <F P=102> 94FE0329F Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 20 Dec 93  p 5 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0329F </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] [Tsukuba] Nippon Paper Co., Ltd. (Nippon Paper), has  discovered a bacteria strain capable of efficient decomposition  of lignin, a component of wood, and has developed a pulp  bleaching technology with the bacteria. Nippon Paper claims that  the new technology produces whiter regenerated paper than that  produced by the usual method. Thus, the new technology is  expected to replace the existing method of using chlorine-based  bleaching agent that is the potential source for harmful  substances, including dioxin, and the unpleasant odor.    Lignin is a polymer contained in the ligneous parts of plant  and is also a colored component in pulp production. The research  group at Nippon Paper sought lignin-digestible bacteria from  whitish, putrefied trees and certain groups of mushrooms.    As a result, the group was able to isolate a strain of  bacteria that was highly capable of discoloring pulp in agar  media. When unbleached pulp (whiteness of 51 percent) that had  been treated with oxygen and alkali was treated with the  bacteria for one week at 30C, the whiteness of pulp  improved to more than 80 percent.    Although some lignin-decomposing bacteria had been known in  the past, this particular strain discovered by Nippon Paper was  found to be more capable of bleaching than any of the previously  known bacteria strains. Nippon Paper will try to grow variants  from this strain and achieve a pulp whiteness of 88-90 percent,  which is equivalent to the whiteness of high-quality paper.    Today, pulp is being bleached with a large quantity of a  chlorine-based chemical at a high temperature. This process has  become an environmental pollution problem because, at such a  high temperature, the chlorine-based chemical produces harmful  substances including dioxin. Therefore, the technology using a  microorganism is expected not only to alleviate environmental  pollution, but also to reduce the cost of the pulp bleaching  process.</p>

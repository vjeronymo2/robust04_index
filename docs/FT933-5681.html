			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Defence groups angered by size of EC aid bid DEFENCE GROUPS yesterday criticised the government for seeking only Pounds 15m in regional aid from the European Commission to help areas hit by military spending cuts. Organisations representing regions where falling defence orders have led to plant closures and thousands of job losses, said the application for a share of the Pounds 100m Konver fund would not cover the costs of helping companies diversify into civilian production. Under the scheme, announced earlier this year by Mr Bruce Millan, EC regional policy commissioner, the government had until yesterday to submit its outline plans and spending needs to help areas dependent on defence. Britain is seeking Ecu20.1m (Pounds 15.4m) in aid, which would be matched by the government, local authorities or the private sector. Campaign groups bidding for EC aid in areas such as Lancashire, Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire said the total aid package of Pounds 30m, spread across the country, would be largely ineffective in paying for new business start-ups, technology transfer schemes, vocational training, and the conversion of disused military bases. The Western Development Partnership in Avon, which is supporting a joint bid by the three western counties for Pounds 6m in aid, said Britain's application was disappointing. The partnership said yesterday: 'It's a very paltry amount to address the problem.' In Lancashire, where defence cuts have been blamed for 7,000 job losses in recent years, officials expressed dismay at the UK submission. Mr David Miller, director of economic development at Lancashire Enterprise, said: 'We've already won matching funds for projects worth Pounds 11m next year. Now the government is only offering us Pounds 2.4m - the money just isn't enough.' Officials at the Department of Trade and Industry yesterday denied the government had submitted an application for less money than Britain deserved. The DTI said it had been told by the Commission there was no more than Pounds 15m available over the next year. Brussels said aid could be increased in future years.</p>

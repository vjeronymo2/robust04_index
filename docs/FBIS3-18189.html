In this process,  German-French partnership is more indispensable than ever,  Alphandery said, according to the prereleased script of a speech  he will deliver in Bonn on Tuesday evening [24 February] at an  event organized by the Federation of German Chambers of Industry  and Commerce, where he will speak to about 400 leading German  industry representatives.    The second stage of the EMU, which has been underway since  January, requires even closer political cooperation so as to  adjust the basic economic data for the third stage, Alphandery  said. The issue is not only public finances and conditions for  healthy and lasting growth. What is necessary is "solidarity  and determined action with persistence so as to further develop  the competitiveness of the companies and combat unemployment."  The preservation of social peace also depends on solving  Europe's competitive problems.    Alphandery called for implementing the growth initiative of  the European Union with loans of ECU8 billion (about 15 billion  German marks) by the European Investment Bank. This is a path  to make Europe resistance to trade protectionism and to keep it  open for world trade. In this connection, he recalled the  intensive German-French cooperation in concluding the new GATT  world trade agreement.    The European Monetary System must not be called into  question, the French finance minister said. The extension of  the exchange rate margins in 1993 was a success. Monetary  policy cooperation between Germany and France and the close  interlacing of the two national economies have also contributed  to mastering the dangers of inflation in other European  countries. According to Alphandery, there are 2,000 German  companies in France and 1,000 French companies in Germany.</p>

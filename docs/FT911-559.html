			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Labour party puts on a new face: Policy document contains cautious strategies and a confident tone in equal measure After months shrouded in the rhetorical smokescreen of the poll tax, Britain's political battlefield finally cleared this week to reveal the true terrain upon which the parties will fight the coming general election. To nobody's surprise, it was the old familiar ground. The tax-cuts-versus-improved-services debate has confirmed that at the next election voters will once again be asked to choose between the competing claims of Labour's case for public provision and the Tories' fiscally-oriented vision of freedom. What makes the up-coming episode in the electoral soap opera different from 1987 is Labour's claim to a wholescale shift in its strategic vision. Officials say that the outcome of the most thoroughgoing policy review in the party's history has ensured that Labour has never been more coherent in its arguments, consensual in its appeal and prudent in its spending plans. 'The message is that we are the good managers now,' one Labour insider claimed this week. 'It is up to the Tories to fight their way back on to the centre ground that we are now occupying. They are the extremists.' But has Labour really changed? How fair is the hard left's charge that Labour has surrendered the class struggle to become all but synonymous with Heathite Toryism, or the intellectuals' gripe that in its lust for electoral glory the party has voluntarily jettisoned its radical tradition? Above all, leaving policies aside, is Labour's change of style enough for voters to entrust it with the keys to Downing Street? In the atmosphere of election fever now gripping Westminster, merely to hint at such questions is enough to provoke paroxysms of suppressed fury from the loyal staff around Mr Neil Kinnock's office. After the grinding years of internal party reforms, the crackdown on the so-called 'loony left', the seemingly endless policy review and the uncomfortably sober suits, how, they ask, can the media that howled at left-wing extremism now complain that reborn Labour lacks the beef? Questioned as to the 'big idea' of the new democratic socialism, an aide close to the Labour leader could only mutter through gritted teeth: 'Just read the document, it is all in there.' Yet a careful reading of Labour's latest policy digest - something, incidentally, not widely available to voters - produces inconclusive answers. 'Opportunity Britain: Labour's Better Way for the 1990s' is undoubtedly a more interesting read than its well-meaning title suggests. Above all, its reasoned language and conciliatory phrasing is in pointed contrast to the hectoring, didacticism and righteous indignation that permeated 'Britain Will Win', the 1987 manifesto. Then, Mr Kinnock's table-thumping introduction insisted: 'No party other than Labour can possibly win enough seats to form a government' at a time when his troops were all but level-pegging with the Liberal/Social Democrat Alliance. Today, with Labour alongside the Tories, a new and calming positivism suffuses the text in a succession of uplifting nouns. 'We have confidence in the strengths and the potential of Britain and its people,' Mr Kinnock begins. 'Ours is a beautiful country, rich in natural resources and talents.' Such linguistic devices are not merely decorative; the measured tones are a significant part of Labour's message, conjuring a mood of contemplative maturity throughout the 58-page text as a counterpoint to the 'irrational' nature of the Tories' market-dictated alternatives. Where the 1987 manifesto referred to Tory 'bribes,' to 'speculators' building 'luxury apartments' and to 'the rich', the rhetoric of class hatred has now gone. The Tories are no longer malicious, merely misguided. Gone too is Labour's once familiar lexicon of initials, institutions and other macho symbols of power. In place, for example, of the 1987 manifesto section on 'Democracy in the Workplace' with its 15 references to workers and unions, the new document's discussion of pay contains only two. Moreover, the endlessly repeated key words are 'rational' and 'productivity'. Those that claim this is mere camouflage for the old corporatism ever lurking beneath Labour's public image may, conceivably, have a case. But the change, at least, indicates the party now explicitly recognises that electoral success demands a new of theme. That shift is reflected in Mr Kinnock's definition of Labour's goal in his introduction. 'The great task which will face a new Labour government,' he writes, 'is the modernisation of Britain. Modernisation means providing the stable conditions and the strategic policies to help our industries succeed in markets at home and abroad.' Depending on the reader's prejudices, this is either a desirable and necessary objective or a truism applicable to all parties or, some hardline Tories might suggest, a coded justification for hands-on government interference in business. As the great odyssey into Labour's partnership society gets under way, it becomes clear that the democratic socialist vision of the road to prosperity now draws as much from Japan as it does from Scandinavia. Its goals, too, appear essentially middle-class - the liberation, not of the unionised worker, but of the individual citizen through prosperity and opportunity arrived at by collective endeavour. Equality is to do with opportunity and access to power, a means to liberty but not an end in itself. But as Mr Kinnock told Mr Brian Walden in a recent television interview, Labour insists that such objectives cannot fall into place without involvement by government. 'Not,' he added, by 'fiddling and meddling everywhere and not by being interventionists in an oppressive sense, but being there as an enabling government . . . a servant state at the disposal of the people.' But is that what the policies themselves promise? The answer is a matter of interpretation. Certainly, behind the new language, the body of the text provides plenty for the backroom boys at Conservative Central Office in Smith Square to sink their ideological teeth into. Under the austere direction of Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, Labour is committed only to raising pensions and restoring the full value of child benefit. Yet even a rudimentary glance through the text spots a glut of new quangos - Smith Square with characteristic hyperbole puts the figure in hundreds - two new cabinet rank posts (women and overseas development) and numerous junior ministerial posts, commissioners and ombudsmen. When it comes to the opening economic chapter of the digest, Labour is inevitably circumscribed by the UK's membership of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. After an opening complaint that interest rate reductions were 'too little, too late' - Labour still has to explain how, given ERM constraints, they could have been lowered more quickly - the reader is hurried along to peruse prescriptions for the longer term. Aside from credit controls and efforts to promote investment, innovation and research and development through tax allowances, there is the strong impression of padding out here with such promises as efforts to 'facilitate the establishment of small businesses by women . . . (and) ethnic minorities'. Training and European monetary union, which might have been expected to be found elsewhere, help to fill the gap. On health and education, Labour combines conservatism with ambition, pledging to rein back the Tories' radical reforms while improving services, always accompanied by the now obligatory nod to careful resource management. In the minefield of industrial law, Labour treads on tiptoe, restoring some union rights but maintaining the obligation to conduct strike ballots. In the equally perilous areas of benefits, social security and the proposed national minimum wage, the party resorts to blind faith in its assertion that, combined with tax changes, 'millions of people' will be removed from the poverty trap. Where Labour is, arguably, most ambitious is in its constitutional chapter, promising a radicalism far advanced on that of 1987. The elected, tax-raising Scottish parliament is still there, but alongside come regional administrations. 'Labour is determined to pass power downwards and outwards from Westminster and Whitehall,' the document explains, with the regions taking on many powers currently housed in London. Furthermore, unlike in 1987, the old nettle of House of Lords reform is finally grasped with a new elected second chamber empowered to delay for the lifetime of a parliament Labour's multi-faceted raft of citizens' rights legislation. But where the document waxes most eloquent in its reticence is on the political time-bomb of electoral reform - the issue that increasingly forms a fault line now running through the party. The final chapter on international issues bears the skilled diplomatic handwriting of Mr Gerald Kaufman, the shadow foreign secretary, eschewing controversy. So what does the document say about the new model Labour party? The answer is ambivalent and perhaps reverts to the change in tone. While Opportunity Britain occasionally gets carried away with its own good intentions, it is undoubtedly a thoroughly worthy programme, carefully targeted, and created by a party that yearns for power. Its excesses can be safely put down to the licence that opposition grants. Indeed, some of Labour's in-house critics claim that its real weakness is the tell-tale trace of committee room politics in which everyone's pet project has received a mention. As such it exposes the very weakness of consensus politics. The Labour party is now, arguably, the most conservative force in British politics - reactionary even in its appeal to a community spirit that many believe is as nostalgically out of date as red telephone boxes. Those views are not Tory, but the criticisms voiced by many Labour party members and sympathisers. Where Labour hints at radicalism - devolution, citizen power (a borrowing from Mr Paddy Ashdown shared by the Tories) and House of Lords reform - it does so sotto voce in an emollient language aimed at excising excitement. Moreover, while there is real beef in the document, it is mincemeat not steak, ground to ease digestion for delicate stomachs. Labour's working-class warriors like Mr Dennis Skinner, the MP for Bolsover, say the party has gone soft. But this constituency is no longer relevant. More potent are the arguments of the Fabian and former marxist intellectuals. They claim that the party may be missing a vital opportunity to create a 'popular front of the mind' by presenting a truly radical programme to excite the imagination of a broad anti-Tory coalition. What, exactly, would this programme be? The prescriptions are vague. But most embrace a broad swathe of the Liberal Democrat programme including fiercer devolution, a federalist vision of Europe and, most emphatically, some form of electoral reform. That may be to come. Professor Raymond Plant's working party on the issue is due to release a preliminary report in July. With polls indicating voter enthusiasm for change, Mr Kinnock may yet be tempted to dangle the possibility before the electorate. After the long years hauling his party back from the brink, the Labour leader can be forgiven for caution now. Opportunity Britain is a testament to that strategy. So close is Labour to power that a single political banana skin for the government - the National Health Service reforms are looking increasingly like one - could be enough to do the trick. On the other hand, voters may study Labour's new face, thoroughly approve it, then opt to take the tax cuts instead.</p>

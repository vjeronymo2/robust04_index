			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WITNESS TELLS OF BRIDGE GAME WITH KRAFT ON NIGHT OF 2 SLAYINGS  </P> <P> Randy Steven Kraft was playing bridge with friends the night that two men he is  accused of killing were last seen alive near Cypress College, a defense witness  testified Tuesday.  </P> <P> But Orange County prosecutors, who have charged Kraft with 16 murders, view  that bridge game in 1983 as highly beneficial to their own case.  </P> <P> Several defense witnesses at Kraft's trial in Orange County Superior Court have  testified about his activities the weekend that two men, Geoffrey Alan Nelson  and Rodger James DeVaul, died. The attorneys contend that Kraft did not have  time to kill them, dump their bodies 48 miles apart, and still be at places  where witnesses saw him.  </P> <P> Nelson, 18, and DeVaul, 20, were last seen at about 1:30 a.m. on Saturday  morning, Feb. 12, 1983. Nelson's body was found at 5:30 a.m. that morning along  the Euclid Street on-ramp to the Garden Grove Freeway in Garden Grove. DeVaul's  body was found near Mt. Baldy in the Angeles National Forest the next day,  Sunday, but evidence showed that he could have been dumped there as early as  Saturday morning.  </P> <P> A co-worker of Kraft has placed him in Rolling Hills Estates, on the Palos  Verdes Peninsula, at St. Ives Laboratories at 9 a.m. that Saturday. On Tuesday,  Harry Eylar, a friend of Kraft, testified that on the Friday night before the  victims were last seen, he was with Kraft at a poker and bridge party at a  friend's house in Huntington Beach. Kraft played bridge, Eylar said, until the  games broke up at almost midnight.  </P> <P> But prosecutors were excited about Eylar's testimony for several reasons:  </P> <P> One is that it places Kraft in Orange County the same night Nelson and DeVaul  were last seen. It also leaves an hour and a half between the time he left the  party and the time the victims disappeared.  </P> <P> But also important to prosecutors was the revelation that the card party was in  Huntington Beach. They have contended that an entry of "2 in 1 Beach" on a list  found in Kraft's car stands for the Nelson and DeVaul killings. That is because  what appeared to investigators as beach sand was found on DeVaul's body.  </P> <P> But now prosecutors are wondering whether "2 in 1 Beach" refers to the fact  that Kraft played cards in Huntington Beach the night that he found two men  together.  </P> <P> Prosecutors contend that the list with 61 entries found in Kraft's car is his  own score card of people he has killed. Kraft's attorneys argue that the list  is meaningless.  </P> <P> Kraft attorney C. Thomas McDonald has also said he believes that the defense  has shown that it was virtually impossible for Kraft to have killed Nelson and  DeVaul. He would had to have done it all either between 1:30 a.m. and 5:20 a.m.  -- evidence shows Nelson's body was dumped immediately before it was found --  or between 5:20 a.m. and 9 a.m., when he was at work at St. Ives.  </P> <P> Prosecutors contend that the time parameters set out by the defense's own  witnesses show it was possible.  </P> <P> Pictures of DeVaul were found in Kraft's car and house. In several of them  DeVaul is nude, and in others a mark is clearly shown on his neck. Pathologists  say the neck mark is the result of pressure on the neck which killed him. Also,  DeVaul is wearing Nelson's jacket in the pictures, which he had only borrowed  for that night.  </P> <P> Other defense witnesses Tuesday included two men who worked with Kraft at Lear  Siegler Inc. in 1980, when another of the men Kraft is accused of killing was  found.  </P> <P> The victim, Wyatt Loggins, 19, was last seen alive the night of Aug. 20, 1980,  near the Huntington Beach Pier.  </P> <P> Witness Ben Wroblewski said he had a business lunch with Kraft in San Diego on  Saturday, Aug. 21, after they had worked together that morning.  </P> <P> "Did he appear to be preoccupied with anything?" asked Kraft attorney James G.  Merwin.  </P> <P> "Not at all," Wroblewski said.  </P> <P> "Out of sorts in any way?"  </P> <P> "No."  </P> <P> "Disheveled? Businesslike?"  </P> <P> "Businesslike," Wroblewski answered.  </P> <P> Pictures of Loggins on a couch were found in Kraft's car and home.  </P> <P> The Kraft trial, which began with jury selection last July, is now into the  third week of the defense's testimony. Attorneys for Kraft, 43, so far have  touched on just five of the 16 deaths with which he is charged.  </P></p>

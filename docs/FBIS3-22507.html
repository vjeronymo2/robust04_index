In June 1992 it was found that 328 inhabitants  out of 717 in three villages in the municipal district of Tak  suffered from this disease. It had been contracted by eating  food prepared with raw or half-cooked fish. It was found a great  deal among laborers. It caused chronic inflammation of the bile  ducts, and, long-term, it could cause cancer of the bile ducts  and liver.    Therefore the Tak Province public health office advised the  people of Tak how to prevent contracting liver flukes by not  eating raw fish and half-cooked fish, by defecating in hygienic  toilets, and by washing their hands every time before eating.  The office also devised a plan to prevent and control liver  flukes by teaching hygiene to each target group and by setting  up mobile units to examine feces for the people of every  district until October.    He invited everyone to ask for a fecal examination from the  mobile fecal examination teams in each district or from any  nearby hospital. The fee for the examination was 10 baht. The  cost of the medicine to treat the disease was another 10 baht if  the test indicated the disease.</p>

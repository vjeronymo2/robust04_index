			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of Government Work Report delivered by </F> autonomous regional Chairman Gyaincain Norbu at the Second  Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous Regional People's  Congress; from the "News" program -- read by announcer]    [Text] In his report, Chairman Gyaincain Norbu said: We  will vigorously develop educational services, and attain, by the  turn of this century, the goals of building a middle school in  every county and a primary school in every township, enrolling  80 percent of school-age pupils, and satisfying the demand for  qualified personnel in a socialist market economy. We will give  priority to developing teachers' training, and nurture a reserve  pool of professionally competent and politically reliable  teachers. We should firmly foster the concept that science and  technology are the primary productive forces, and that the  economy should be developed through scientific and technological  advances. While paying attention to research and development,  we will accelerate the conversion of scientific and  technological findings into productive forces, so that Tibet's  economy will progressively shift toward the path of development  based on scientific and technological advances.    We will take practical and feasible measures to keep the  existing pool of qualified personnel stable by improving their  living and working conditions, inspiring their initiative, and  giving full scope to their intelligence and talent. We will  encourage various qualified personnel to work at the grass-roots  level and the forefront of production where they can display  their abilities. We will implement preferential policies and  adopt active measures to systematically or freely bring in all  kinds of useful qualified personnel whom our region needs badly;  to allow such personnel to work in one place or move freely from  one place to another; and to employ them on a long-term or  short-term basis with the goal of gradually expanding our pool  of qualified personnel.    On creating a good social environment to ensure smooth  progress in reform and development, the report said: We should  consistently follow the principle of moving on two fronts  simultaneously to keep the situation even more stable. We must  wage a thoroughgoing antisplittist campaign. In fighting  against splittism, we must firmly show faith in and rely on the  masses, carry out publicity and organizational efforts among  them, thoroughly expose splittists' plots, and constantly  heighten public awareness of the need to combat splittism. We  should resolutely crack down on disturbances and trouble plotted  by splittist forces, to whom we should never show leniency.    We will bolster governments at the grass-roots level and  conscientiously carry out mass work. Constantly improving the  people's material and cultural standards is a fundamental goal  of economic development, as well as the basis of government  work. We should firmly foster the mass viewpoint, and go down  to the grass roots and among the masses to carry out  investigation and study, conduct business on the spot, solve  problems, and provide work guidance to ensure smooth progress in  reform and production.</p>

"After several attempt to discuss with the leadership the  absence of democracy and consultation within Fatah, we had no  choice but to resign," said 33-year-old Jibril al-Bakri.    "The leadership has appointed to positions of responsibility  people who have nothing to do with Fatah", al-Bakri said, but  refused to explain.    Husayn al-Nazir, 30, and Diyab al-Sharabati, 35, resigned  from Fatah's High Committee in Hebron along with al-Bakri.    Their move follows a walkout at the end of December by three  leaders of the Fatah youth movement in Gaza after 'Arafat gave  top jobs to aging Palestinians who played little part in the  uprising or intifadah. The Fatah chief for the north of the  West Bank also stood down.    "These resignations reflect a crisis as Fatah changes into a  political party, said Jamal al-Shubaqi, another senior Fatah  figure in Hebron.    The Palestine Liberation Organization's executive committee  met in Tunis this week to discuss democratization after a  petition from 120 leading Palestinian figures.</p>

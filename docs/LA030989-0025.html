			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SAN FERNANDO FIGHTS TO WIN IN TOURNAMENT TITLE GAME  </P> <P> In a manner of speaking, it all boiled down to first base.  </P> <P> That is, St. Francis High had plenty of trouble getting anyone there, and when  it did, there was trouble of the first order.  </P> <P> San Fernando defeated St. Francis, 11-4, in the championship game of the La  Canada tournament Wednesday night at La Canada High in a 2-hour, 58-minute game  that was marred by a bench-clearing brawl in the top of the fourth inning.  </P> <P> San Fernando (3-0) took a 7-0 lead in the first and, with right-hander Frank  Serna in control, St. Francis managed only two hits in the first 3 1/3innings.  The Tigers held a 10-0 lead with one out in the fourth, when the game turned  from rout to riot.  </P> <P> St Francis' Matt Jones, attempting to beat out a ground ball to third, ran into  first baseman John Najar, knocking the San Fernando player to the ground. Najar  got a glove on the ball, which rolled into foul territory.  </P> <P> Jones attempted to scramble back to the bag and became entangled with Najar,  who appeared to have tried to trip Jones on his way back. The pair tackled each  other, and seconds later, the benches cleared and several other skirmishes  broke out.  </P> <P> Najar and Jones were ejected and there was a 15-minute delay as tournament  officials and umpires decided whether to continue.  </P> <P> After the game, two squad cars from the L. A. Sheriff's Department waited in  the parking lot to keep the peace.  </P> <P> St. Francis' Manny Fernandez, who was on the bench when the fight broke out,  picked up a bloody nose after joining the melee. He returned to the bench and  grabbed a bat, turned around and headed toward a tangled pile of players before  he was forcibly restrained by several teammates.  </P> <P> "What happened had nothing to do with baseball," St. Francis Coach Tom Moran  said. "It's not good for baseball, it's not good for either school.  </P> <P> Moran said he "will discipline any player who left the bench," and that  Fernandez, like many others in the brawl, simply lost control.  </P> <P> "He was just out of it," Moran said. "He had a bloody nose, and he was just not  thinking straight. Believe me, I will take care of anyone who came off the  bench."  </P> <P> Najar suffered a badly bruised eye, and even Serna took a blow to the head.  </P> <P> "It's too bad this had to happen, because it really takes away from some good  performances by a couple of our kids," said San Fernando Coach Steve Marden,  who had little chance to enjoy the first tournament victory in his 11 years at  the school.  </P> <P> Serna (2-0) was almost unhittable in his five innings on the mound, allowing no  runs on two hits. The senior struck out five and walked one before leaving in  the sixth.  </P> <P> "He had done what we wanted," Marden said. "It was already 10-zip at that  point, and besides, his eye was starting to swell up."  </P> <P> San Fernando (3-0) received most of its offense from senior shortstop Bobby  Corrales, who had four hits in five at-bats. Corrales drove in the first run in  the first inning, as the Tigers rocked Knights' right-hander Erik Hagge for  seven runs in one-third of an inning.  </P> <P> "He just never got untracked," Moran said of Hagge. "Of course, they had a lot  to do with that. That's a very good high school baseball team."  </P> <P> Corrales finished with five runs batted in. St. Francis did not score until the  seventh, when it spanked San Fernando reliever Jess Vasquez for four runs.  </P></p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: Wine industry with growing pains  -One of Australia's top export sectors is coming of age Draw up a list of high-growth businesses in Australia, and the country's wine export industry would be close to the top. But anyone who imagines that this results in unfurrowed brows and bucolic relaxation in prime wine-growing districts, such as South Australia's Barrossa Valley or New South Wales's Hunter region, would be mistaken. The industry is young - at least in international terms - and beset with growing pains. It has ambitious growth targets, most notably a tripling of export sales to about ADollars 1bn (USDollars 735m) by the turn of the century. But if the industry is to meet these objectives, it needs to achieve a sharp expansion in grape supply and processing capacity, which requires investment dollars. This, in turn, has prompted a restructuring. On the one hand, several Australian wine companies have headed to the stock market, bolstering their capital through share issues and flotations. In just two years, a meaningful quoted wine sector has been created, comprising nine companies and with a total capitalisation (including Southcorp, which also has non-wine interests) of ADollars 2bn. On the other hand, there has been steady concentration within the industry and a large amount of foreign investment. France's Pernod-Ricard, for example, controls the Orlando Wyndham group, and Moet has a winery in Victoria. Few analysts think that these trends will abate. 'We foresee winery ownership and control of output . . . becoming increasingly concentrated,' commented Ms Kiera Grant, at Hambros Equities, in a recent industry review. 'A majority of the existing, small inefficient wineries will struggle to return to a profit (and) will be replaced by larger, highly capitalised, strongly integrated and highly technical companies, whose commercial focus will be evenly divided between domestic and overseas markets,' the review concluded. This coming-of-age process can be traced back to the mid-1980s. Wine-growing in Australia is almost as old as European settlement - the first grapevines were planted in in 1788 - but it was only a decade ago that the industry discovered the export market. This happened almost by chance, at a time when Australian wineries were looking to overload surplus stocks. The quality of the Australian produce, its relative value (due in part to the then-sickly Australian dollar), and some perceived problems within the European wineries, caused exports to markets such as Scandinavia and the UK to take off - and they have increased ever since. In 1985-86, Australian wine exports totalled 10.8m litres. By 1992-93, they had risen ten-fold, to 102.8m litres. This sharp overseas growth has helped to offset a flat domestic market. Back home, wine sales struggled to reach 312m litres in 1992-93, a slight reduction on the 325m litres seen seven years earlier. The downturn, more marked in per capita terms, has generally been attributed to heightened drink-driving concerns and rising health awareness. A tendency among Australian consumers to move upmarket, buying smaller quantities of higher-quality wines, may have exacerbated the trend. The bullish point for the wine companies is that this expansion in non-domestic sales shows little sign of flattening out. In 1993, exports increased 42 per cent in volume terms, to 124.8m litres, and by 36.5 per cent in value, to ADollars 357.1m. The UK and New Zealand were the strongest contributors to this growth, although sales to the US and Canada also rose markedly. Japan, by contrast, remains far less satisfactory: Australian wines are still dogged by an image problem and the industry is rethinking its marketing approach. Some wine makers warn that the disappointing 1993 vintage may lead to a temporary dip in exports later this year, but say that the current year's healthy results should then put the industry back on track. If the ADollars 1bn export target is met, strong sales in the UK and North America will probably need to be augmented by increased demand from continental Europe. That may be helped by a deal between Brussels and Canberra earlier this year, in which Australia agreed to stop using European wine names - such as Champagne or Chablis - provided the European Union recognised Australian wine techniques. However, even in the most promising markets, managing this growth looks likely to be a delicate task. Australian wines tend to sell strongly in lower price categories, as a good-value, workaday product. This leaves the industry vulnerable to new competition and price pressures - for example, too much appreciation in the Australian dollar. That will make it doubly difficult to ensure that supply balances demand. It has been estimated that if the ADollars 1bn export target is to be met by the turn of the century, Australian wineries will have to produce an additional 186m litres. This would require about 250,000 tonnes of premium grapes, or about 14,000 hectares of additional planted land. Those plantings would need to occur in the next three years, to ensure continuity of supply by 2000. No one is complacent: 'I'm not relaxed, and there is a debate going on, but it doesn't look too bad at the moment,' says Mr Paul Van Der Lee, at the Winemakers Federation of Australia. He points to recent statistics which show that the leading industry players plan to plant more than 2,000 hectares in 1994, and almost 1,900 hectares in 1995. Mr Van Der Lee also makes the point that if Australian wines can manage 'an evolution towards the higher price segment', the ADollars 1bn target could be met by an increase in export values, not just volume. At least some of Australia's larger wine companies are in the throes of heavy investment programmes which are partly designed to ensure that reliance on grape supply contracts - that is, buying in the grapes from independent growers - does not increase. Mildura Blass, for example, is spending about ADollars 30m on new vineyard development. Southcorp, which takes in the Penfolds and Lindemans labels and sources about 40 per cent of its grape supply internally, has allocated ADollars 100m over about four years to fund expansion. About ADollars 60m will go on vineyards and the remainder on augmenting production facilities. With plans like these, it seems that access to investors' funds can only become more important - and that the quoted wine sector, like the industry, is set to grow.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     AUSTRALIA'S QUOTED WINE SECTOR  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 Flotation         Market cap.                                      date         (ADollarsm)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Australian Vintage                   1994                 9.3 Simeon Wines*                        1994               25.25 Petaluma                             1993                27.6 Peter Lehman                         1993               13.04 Brian McGuigan Wines                 1992               15.31 BRL Hardy                            1992              194.53 Coldstream                         **1992                11.9 Rothbury Wines                       1992                32.6 Mildura Blass                        1988               268.9 Southcorp                             ***             1,528.8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Floated by Orlando Wydnham, which retains minority stake ** ASX listing *** Formally SA Brewing; brewing interests sold in 1993, but still retains packaging and appliance manufacturing divisions  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

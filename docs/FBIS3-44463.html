With the  dawning of the new year, the unitary and managed floating  exchange rate system of the renminbi on the basis of market  supply and demand was formally introduced, thus marking a great  stride forward in the foreign exchange management system.  Simultaneously, or immediately afterward, the work to establish  a modern enterprise system, as well as reform in the market  system, taxation, finance, foreign trade, housing, and other  important spheres was or will be carried out.    With the rapid advance and a deeper degree of reform, the  Chinese economy is bound to face a new and rigorous test.    How can we achieve high-speed growth without causing  inflation?    It has been learned that President Jiang Zemin consulted  several noted economists on this problem.    Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is in charge of economic  affairs, also is seeking the best way to solve this problem.    As a matter of fact, an outlook of China's economic  situation  in 1994 shows that it is very necessary to study and discuss  this problem in a profound manner.    According to economists' predictions, the national economy  will maintain high-speed growth in 1994 because of the strong  support of the following four factors: 1) The large domestic  demand of this country of 1.2 billion can continue to give the  necessary impetus to economic growth. 2) Owing to unbalanced  industrial development and relatively backward basic industries  and infrastructure, it is necessary to strengthen construction,  which can give a strong impetus to current economic development,  as well as create conditions for future economic development.  3) The driving force of reform remains strong in the process  of transforming the old system into a new one, and the  production potentials that were restrained under the old system  still have to be released continuously. 4) In order to carry  out the basic national policy of opening up to the outside  world, the Chinese economy will draw closer to the international  economy. China can constantly introduce and assimilate advanced  technology and management experience from other countries,  absorb international resources to make up domestic deficiency,  and strengthen the domestic economy's capability to develop.  <H5>  Four Negative Effects of Macroscopic Regulation </H5>   Viewed from the situation in 1993, high-speed economic  growth  will bring about a painful lesson if it is not grasped  scientifically and effectively. Last year, at a time when high-  speed economic growth was being achieved, prices also soared and  there was a very severe phenomenon of economic disorder. With  the second half of last year, the central authorities could not  help but introduce emergency macroscopic regulation measures.  This series of measures already has achieved some results, the  situation of economic disorder has changed, and the overall  situation is developing in a positive way, but the Chinese  economy still faces three kinds of problems following the  introduction of macroscopic regulation: 1) The level of  commodity price rises in the market is still too high.  Commodity price is a "backward" index that fully reflects the  situation of high economic growth, the policy of large currency  supply, and vigorous price reform in the previous stage. 2)  Four negative effects are exposed by macroscopic regulation:  Insufficient funds, a discrepancy between production and  marketing and more payments in arrears, the frequent occurrence  of the phenomena of production stoppage and semistoppage, and  lower industrial benefits. 3) The phenomenon of unbalanced  economic development still exists and there is no marked  progress in structural readjustment.    According to figures released by the State Statistics  Bureau,  the economic growth rate in China last year was 13 percent and  the inflation rate also was 13 percent. These two figures were  precisely the real situation of China's economic development in  1993.    Viewed from the prospects of the economy and commodity  prices  in China in 1994, experts predict that the economy will continue  to maintain a growth rate of 10 percent or so, and that only  after a series of effective measures are taken by the government  can the inflation rate be controlled at 10 percent or so.    Hence, we can see also that the situation in 1994 will  hardly  be less grim than that in 1993.  <H5>  Reform Measures Are Related to Commodity Prices </H5>   Some economists pointed out: The negative effects were  exposed by macroscopic regulation after last August, and the  central authorities put a large amount of currency into  circulation. From the angle of economics, commodity prices will  rise about a year after currency circulation, so after the  coming August, inflation may arise again in society and the  government will bear great commodity price pressures.    On the other hand, viewed from China's current social  situation, only at a level of slight price rises can rapid  growth of the national economy be achieved. This is because:  1) As returns on investment in industrial enterprises are low  in times of high inflation rates, a large amount of funds will  be shifted to stock speculation, real estate, and other  non-productive areas, which makes it very easy for a  bubble-economy craze to arise, thus aggravating the investment  and industrial structures, and damaging the national economy's  foundation for rapid growth. 2) High inflation will strain  every aspect of the national economy so that it is difficult to  implement various measures conducive to reform, thus generating  greater difficulties and risks. 3) High inflation also will  offer a chance for illegal elements to disrupt the market, thus  making it more difficult to complete the marketization process.  4. High inflation also will affect residents' psychological  endurance, thus giving rise to social instability factors.    As a matter of fact, a series of new reform measures  introduced for the sake of accelerating the implementation of  the market economy are related, more or less, to the commodity  price factor.    President Jiang Zemin said at the new year tea party  organized by the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference National Committee: "We must meticulously organize  the introduction and implementation of a series of important  reform measures for the establishment of socialist market  economic system.... We must pay the utmost attention to our  progress, promptly sum up our experience, and strive to succeed  in implementing these measures."    Hence, we can notice the determination and vigilance of the  central government in implementing reform measures in 1994.    The year 1994 is key to China's reform, and the relationship  between high-speed development and a check on inflation  undoubtedly will be a top consideration.</p>

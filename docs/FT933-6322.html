			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Discipline in need of a better chemistry: John Authers on science's bad image in UK schools Why don't you do a nice arts degree, asked the despairing mother of her daughter in a sketch by comediennes Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders. Choosing a physics degree can only lead to life as a boring, socially inadequate spinster, the mother wailed. The sketch was meant as a parody of British attitudes to scientists, but universities trying to fill physics, engineering, and chemistry courses will have found it too true to be funny. With thousands of spaces unfilled, universities have this week been offering science courses to candidates with just two Es at A-level, the lowest pass grade. Arts candidates who narrowly missed required grades are being offered science instead. The shortfall in would-be scientists is the corollary of a fall in pupils taking science at A-level. The number taking physics A-level this year was 9.6 per cent down on last year. For chemistry the figure was 4.5 per cent. A decline in interest is evident also among 16-year-olds taking GCSE examinations. Entries for all science subjects have fallen by 4.15 per cent since 1989, according to figures this week. 'There is an anti-science mood in Britain,' said Sir David Weatherall, president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. The government's response so far has not been to encourage science directly, but to discourage universities from taking on arts students by cutting its contribution to tuition fees for non-scientific subjects for 1993-94. Mr John Patten, education secretary, this week acknowledged that the continuing unpopularity of science is a cause for concern - but said the blame did not lie just at his door. 'I think we are all in this together - the government, teachers and employers,' he said. Mr Patten may be correct to look to employers for an explanation. Although the Confederation of British Industry and Institute of Directors preach the need to build Britain's science expertise, figures for graduate salaries and unemployment rates suggest demand for scientists is little or no higher than for other disciplines. According to CSU, a consultancy which charts graduate salaries, students with degrees in pure science could have expected to start work on Pounds 12,285 a year in 1992, only slightly higher than the Pounds 12,039 for jobs where degree subject was unimportant. Unemployment rates show scientists faring worse than contemporaries who studied arts: of those who graduated with chemistry and physics degrees in 1991, 11.3 per cent were unemployed a year later. For humanities only 8.2 per cent were jobless. Engineering graduates buck the trend among scientists - particularly those with specific skills needed by industry. The average starting salary for engineers last year was Pounds 12,374, higher than the norm for all graduates, and their unemployment rate after 12 months was below average at 8.5 per cent. Although the overall picture suggests that employers are not unduly worried about the lack of science graduates, Ms Margaret Murray, head of the CBI's education unit, said encouraging science is still essential to Britain's industrial competitiveness. The CBI and the IoD argue scientists have skills that industry needs, such as problem-solving experience and confidence with numbers. Ms Murray seized on the shortages of engineers as particularly worrisome. The US trains nearly twice as many engineers per head as the UK, and Japan nearly three times as many, she said. Her concern, however, is not sufficient to overcome a bias against science among children - probably caused as much by a popular perception that the subject is dull as by the status of scientists in the job market. Dr Ann Robinson, the IoD's head of policy, diagnosed a cultural problem. Education has been 'too child-centred and too student-led'. When pupils find a course either difficult or boring schools and universities have been too willing to withdraw it. Reinforcing her point is research by the Association for Science Education, showing the number of students taking science A-levels falls when schools introduce arts courses which children believe are more interesting - such as media studies. Professor Alan Smithers, of Manchester University education department, said the quality of teaching also discourages possible scientists. Below 16, science is usually taught as a set of facts, with little or no element of discovery. Only at A-level do students discover that hard and fast rules learnt by rote are not always correct. The quality of lessons is not helped by the poorer degrees held by science teachers. University Council for the Education of Teachers' figures show that in 1991 almost 40 per cent of physics teachers had a third class degree or lower, compared with 5 per cent for history teachers. Professor Smithers believed there is a vicious spiral: 'Too few science graduates, too few teachers, poor teaching, too few students.' At the same time, constraints of the A-level system itself can act also as a deterrent for scientists. Most university science courses still require three A-levels in related subjects, forcing pupils to abandon arts courses at 16. Such weaknesses in school science have prompted calls for the abolition of A-levels. These have remained untouched since the Conservatives came to power in 1979 even though they follow on uneasily from a new national curriculum which requires studying a breadth of subjects to GCSE level. The government 'refuses to recognise the barrier to improving the science base is its insistence on retaining A-levels in their current form,' said Mr Roger Young, of the Institute of Management. The IM wants a six subject curriculum for 16-18-year-olds, with all pupils following at least one arts subject and one science. Mr Patten's analysis this week was that selling science 'is a marketing problem, trying to persuade children that science is interesting and rewarding'. But attracting more students into science may require more sweeping changes to Britain's further and higher education systems.</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / World Trade News: France says it wants accord on GATT MR Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French trade and industry minister, yesterday sought to defend the government over allegations that Paris is holding up a settlement of the Uruguay Round, writes William Dawkins from Paris. He rejected criticisms that France was using complaints over the fall in the dollar's value to hold up a world trade agreement for internal political reasons. France wanted a Gatt accord, especially on farming. However, it could not impose sacrifices on European agriculture beyond that already agreed in the recent reforms of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), he said. It would be 'unacceptable' for EC farm exports to depend on US monetary policy, he added.</p>

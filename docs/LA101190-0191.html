Wark, who retired.  Nygren was curator of collections at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington  from 1976 to 1988 before going to Smith College.  </P> <P> The Huntington has a comprehensive collection of 18th- and 19th-Century British  and French art, American paintings from the 1730s to the 1930s, and a  collection of Renaissance paintings.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles chapter of the Organization of Chinese American Women will  honor Dr. Serena Young as Outstanding Chinese American Woman at an awards  dinner at the New Otani Hotel at 6 p.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> Young, who had polio as a child, is a general orthopedic surgeon.  </P> <P> Dolores Wong will receive the Individual Community Service Award for her role  in establishing the Chinatown Library.  </P> <P> Eleven South Pasadena residents have been appointed to a committee to plan for  possible municipal budget shortfalls.  </P> <P> The panel was formed on the recommendation of the municipal service audit by  Hughes, Heiss &amp; Associates.

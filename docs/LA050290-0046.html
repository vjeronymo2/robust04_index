			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIGHT OR TALK? BLACK YOUTHS IN S. AFRICA TAKE HARD LINE  </P> <P> Down the street from Nelson Mandela's home, the prospects for a negotiated  peace in troubled South Africa seemed especially dim one recent rainy  afternoon.  </P> <P> "Now is no time to compromise with the enemy," 17-year-old Freedom Kwinana was  telling two young friends. "If a person treats you badly, don't show him you  are fair. You show him you are radical."  </P> <P> Briefcases are replacing bombs as the weapons of liberation for Mandela and  other seasoned leaders of the African National Congress. And the world eagerly  awaits today's start of the talks between the ANC and the government, hoping  for the first black-white negotiations in the history of South Africa.  </P> <P> But in the poverty-stricken townships, and even on Mandela's own middle-class  block in Soweto, hundreds of thousands of black youths are angry and impatient.  Hardened by daily clashes with the police, they doubt the professed good  intentions of a white government that has oppressed the black majority since  long before they were born.  </P> <P> Now Mandela's ANC faces the difficult task of trying to persuade these  disgruntled youngsters that the time has come for talking -- and, yes, even  compromise -- with "the enemy."  </P> <P> ANC leaders admit privately that the country's peace depends on it.  </P> <P> "The youth we have to contend with out there, and the ordinary people too, are  completely cynical about this government's intentions," said Cheryl Carolus, a  leader of the United Democratic Front anti-apartheid coalition.  </P> <P> "These youth are not ultra-leftists. They're the people against whom the might  of the state is still being unleashed," added Carolus, 33, the youngest ANC  delegate to today's talks. "Peace is quite an alien concept for our young  people."  </P> <P> President Frederik W. de Klerk has abruptly changed the political climate in  recent months by removing restrictions on black activists, and he has invited  his government's enemies to the negotiating table.  </P> <P> Mandela, freed in February after 27 years in prison, says he has been impressed  by De Klerk's initiatives, and he and other ANC leaders are willing to talk  with the government about the ANC's conditions for negotiation.  </P> <P> But for many young radicals who see nothing changing in their townships, this  sudden willingness to talk seems premature.  </P> <P> "The African National Congress used to say it would never return to this  country to talk to the government -- only to liberate us," complained Abel  Zwane, 19, who attends high school on Mandela's block. "But now they are coming  back to talk. And liberation is no nearer."  </P> <P> Zwane and Kwinana have joined the ANC rival Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC),  whose no-compromise approach to the government's entreaties is appealing to  increasing numbers of young blacks.  </P> <P> Mandela, the 71-year-old dean of anti-apartheid activists, "is like a father to  us, and we respect him," Zwane said.  </P> <P> But children don't always obey their fathers.  </P> <P> "We thought when he came out of prison everything would change," Zwane  explained. "But so far we see nothing."  </P> <P> South Africa today is dotted with signs of youthful distrust of the government  and discontent with the pace of change.  </P> <P> "Viva No Surrender," reads the freshly painted graffiti on one of the concrete  walls ringing the expensive white homes in Johannesburg's northern suburbs.  </P> <P> A few miles away, in the township of Tembisa, an ANC-aligned youth organization  announced the other day that it was reintroducing so-called people's courts,  the notorious neighborhood tribunals born in the bloody township unrest of  1984-86.  </P> <P> A private survey of 18- to 25-year-old blacks earlier this month concluded that  the ANC's willingness to talk to the government "could pose credibility  problems" for it.  </P> <P> Many of those surveyed said they distrust whites and want De Klerk to step  down, something he has refused to do. And some said they identify more closely  with the hard-line position of the PAC than the more moderate ANC.  </P> <P> The black youth of today were in the front line of the ANC's violent  grass-roots struggle during the 1980s, when thousands died as ANC followers  used limpet mines, street committees and people's courts to defy Pretoria and  try to make the country ungovernable.  </P> <P> That uprising was quashed by the South African government, which used an  emergency decree to break up thousands of political gatherings, detain  thousands of black activists for months and even years without charge and put  hundreds on trial.  </P> <P> By relaxing those clamps on anti-government protest, De Klerk has released but  not cooled the sense of frustration in the townships, where the legacy of 42  years of racial discrimination is readily apparent.  </P> <P> Millions of blacks have marched to protest poor living conditions, high rents,  unequal education and corrupt Pretoria-supported town councils. Several times  in recent weeks, police have opened fire on those demonstrators, and more than  two dozen activists, most of them in their teens, have died.  </P> <P> ANC leaders deny any loss of faith among the younger generation of activists.  But the nation's primary anti-apartheid movement has yet to complete the  massive task of re-establishing itself inside South Africa. And disorganization  at the top, with many leaders suddenly out of jail and exiles preparing to  return, are making the job more difficult.  </P> <P> Mandela and the older generation are urging the youth to remain disciplined and  refrain from undirected violence while at the same time trying to reassure  whites of the ANC's commitment to peace.  </P> <P> But Mandela's accommodating statements contrast sharply with the fiery rhetoric  of the ANC's young radical leaders, who support the ANC decision to open lines  of communication with the government but show little faith in negotiation  politics and speak often of stepping up the war.  </P> <P> "The only thing to negotiate is the transference of power from the minority  regime to the majority," Michael Dube, an 18-year-old leader of an  ANC-affiliated students organization in Soweto, said recently.  </P> <P> "And the only way to do that is to shoot and talk," Dube added.  </P> <P> ANC youth leaders say police killings of black protesters in recent weeks are  undermining their attempts to win young people over to the idea of  negotiations.  </P> <P> "If you want negotiations to be successful, you must get the people to support  you," said Peter Mokaba, president of the ANC-aligned South African Youth  Congress. "But how do you get people to support you when they see the people  you want to talk to firing guns at them in the streets?"  </P> <P> Mokaba recently told a cheering throng of supporters that now is the time "to  wage peace in the communities and wage war on the enemy." Many youngsters in  the crowd carried replicas of AK-47 rifles, carefully carved out of wood and  branded with the name of the ANC's military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of  the Nation).  </P> <P> The rival PAC contends that support for the ANC is slowly draining away among  young people. The PAC's student organization, formed six months ago and known  as PASO, now claims 45,000 members nationwide.  </P> <P> "We are not opposed to negotiations in principle," said Lawrence Nquandela, 24,  the secretary general of PASO. "But at this juncture we feel the enemy is very  strong militarily, and we do not believe any capitalistic government will  voluntarily negotiate itself out of power."  </P> <P> De Klerk's reform initiatives "are just a ploy to get rid of international  pressure," Nquandela added. "And you mustn't lie to the young people."  </P></p>

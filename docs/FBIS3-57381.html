Alimov, attending a ministerial meeting of the 10-member  Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) in Tehran, told AFP he  appreciated an Iranian offer to help end the civil war in  Tajikistan, where government forces have been fighting Muslim  fundamentalists for more than a year.    However, Tajikistan "prefers the crisis to be resolved  through wider efforts undertaken by the United Nations," he  added.    Alimov said the government intended to hold general  elections  in July and called on Tajiks inside and outside the country to  take part.    Last week Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister 'Abbas Maleki said  Iran had launched mediation efforts to end the conflict,  following a request from four other Muslim central Asian states  -- Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan.    He said Iran was determined to use its influence to restore  security to Tajikistan, and had already held talks with Tajik  opposition leaders.    Pro-communist forces seized power in the Tajik capital  Dushanbe in December 1992, toppling the ruling coalition of  democratic and Islamic forces.    Iran has so far adopted a low profile toward the conflict to  avoid antagonising the newly-independent central Asian states,  with which it has been trying to boost economic and cultural  ties.    Iranian President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani opened the  fourth session of the ECO Council of Ministers in Tehran on  Tuesday with a call for an end to conflicts in central Asia and  the Caucasus.    Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati told AFP the crisis in  Tajikistan may be discussed during the two-day meeting.    The ECO was founded in 1985 by Iran, Turkey and Pakistan and  expanded in 1991 to include Afghanistan as well as the former  Soviet republics of Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan,  Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.</p>

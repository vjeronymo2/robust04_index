			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLUE JAYS BATTER ANGEL PITCHERS  </P> <P> The Angel pitching staff has been taking a beating lately. Until Monday night,  it wasn't a matter of bruised earned-run averages, though. They were winning,  yet still experiencing the agony of the feet, shins and ankles.  </P> <P> Starter Chuck Finley became the third Angel pitcher in four days to be hit with  a batted ball, but the Blue Jays did more damage to Angel pitches than pitchers  in an 8-1 victory in front of 24,430 at Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> Toronto scored four runs off Finley, whose departure was hastened in the sixth  by a sharp grounder off the bat of Tony Fernandez that struck him on the inside  of the right ankle. Fernandez, the first batter of the inning, subsequently  scored to break a 1-1 tie.  </P> <P> Before Finley hobbled off, however, Kelly Gruber and George Bell also had  crossed the plate and then the Blue Jays began to batter the Angel bullpen.  Toronto finished the game with 15 hits.  </P> <P> "Chuck's ankle is fine. We took him out because he lost his composure," Manager  Doug Rader said. "He's going through a tough time, but it appeared he was  trying to win two games in one outing."  </P> <P> Finley, who joins Bryan Harvey and Greg Minton on the Angel hit list, was  examined by team physician Dr. Lewis Yocum. The injury was diagnosed as a  contusion, and Finley should be able to make his next start. Harvey took a shot  on his right foot Friday, and Minton was struck in the right shin Saturday.  </P> <P> Rader also exited early, after being ejected by home plate umpire Al Clark.  With two on in the eighth, Clark called Devon White out on strikes and quickly  waved the Angel center fielder toward the dugout when he began to protest.  Rader rushed from the dugout to argue, and quickly earned his first ejection of  the season.  </P> <P> "A player has a right to voice his objection and it's up to the umpire to take  it for a while and then get on with the game," Rader said. "What's Devo  supposed to do? Go right back to the dugout with his tail between his legs?"  </P> <P> That's pretty much how the Angels went in the eighth. Failing to take a cue  from his riled manager, Wally Joyner meekly grounded into a double play to end  the threat.  </P> <P> Finley (7-6) is 0-4 this month, but his performance hardly qualifies as a  classic June swoon. White's fourth-inning solo homer was the only run the  Angels have scored in the last 29 1/3 innings with Finley pitching.  </P> <P> Finley, who had pitched into the seventh inning or later in 11 of his first 13  starts, didn't last that long Monday. But who knows how things would have  turned out had he been able to avoid Fernandez's grounder.  </P> <P> "Chuck is going through a very frustrating time," Rader said. "It would help if  we got him a few runs, that's for sure, but it's part of the education  process."  </P> <P> The Blue Jays scored in the third inning, but they did not look powerful. Kevin  Batiste led off with a bunt. Finley fielded the ball cleanly but then whirled  and fired wildly to first. Batiste advanced to second. Nelson Liriano  sacrificed and Junior Felix lined out to center to score Batiste and give the  Blue Jays a 1-0 lead.  </P> <P> Toronto starter Dave Stieb (7-3) did not allow a hit in the first three  innings, but the Angels had their first hit -- and first run -- in the fourth  when White hit his first pitch over the right-center field fence to tie the  score.  </P> <P> But the Blue Jays knocked Finley out in the sixth. Fernandez hit the shot off  Finley's ankle and then White appeared to misjudge Gruber's line drive to  left-center. White took a bad angle in his attempt to cut off the ball and it  skipped past him and bounded to the wall. Fernandez scored and Gruber jogged to  second.  </P> <P> Bell followed with a double down the left-field line to score Gruber and one  out later, Manny Lee singled to center to score Bell. That was it for Finley,  who gave way to Dan Petry.  </P> <P> Petry gave up three consecutive hits -- including Felix's two-run homer into  the second deck in right-center -- without getting an out in the seventh.  </P> <P> And by the time Willie Fraser was summoned, the Blue Jays led, 6-1, and were on  their way to their first victory in seven games against the Angels.  </P> <P> Fraser didn't exactly restore order. Fernandez took second on a passed ball and  scored on Bell's single off the glove of shortstop Dick Schofield. Pat Borders  singled to right, and Lee hit a ground-rule double that scored Bell to make it  8-1.  </P> <P> Toronto, which sent 10 batters to the plate, left the bases loaded.  </P> <P> "I think everyone knew we hadn't beaten them this year," Toronto Manager Cito  Gaston said. "We didn't talk about it, but we all knew it. This time, we got  good pitching, good hitting and good defense."  </P> <P> It was good enough for a victory.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Tony Armas, who has been on the disabled list since May 16 with a strained left  hamstring, was reinstated Monday and outfielder Dante Bichette was optioned to  triple-A affiliate Edmonton. Bichette, whose surprising numbers this spring  (.388 with four homers and 14 RBIs) convinced Manager Doug Rader to include him  on the 24-man, opening-day roster, had only one hit in his last 16 at-bats and  his average had slipped to .195. Bichette said he had been anticipating the  move for "two or three weeks," but that didn't seem to lessen the blow. "I  guess it's for the best," he said.  </P> <P> Rader said that a number of factors -- not the least of which is Claudell  Washington's success against left-handed pitching -- have diminished Bichette's  playing time. "We originally thought that if we could get Dante 200 to 250  at-bats, being up here would be a bigger plus than having him play every day in  triple-A," Rader said. "But I don't see how in the world we can get him that  many in this situation. He's way out of sync at the plate and the only thing  you can forecast is more of the same. And that's counter productive. Now, if we  have to press him into service because of an injury, he'll be better prepared."  . . . Armas said he feels good but doesn't want to play first base anymore  because "I stretch or pull a muscle on every play." He needn't worry. "Tony's  reflexes aren't suited to first base," Rader said. "We're going to keep him out  in the patch (outfield) from now on."  </P></p>

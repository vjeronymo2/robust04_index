			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Russians buy E German plant A former east German state cellulose factory has been sold to a private Russian company which wants to pay for urgently needed modernisation by exporting Russian coal to the west, writes Leslie Colitt in Berlin. Mr Yuri Gekht, chairman of Sokolniki company, signed a contract this week with the Treuhand privatisation agency to buy the United Cellulose Works in Pirna which was in liquidation. He paid a symbolic DM1 for the company. Mr Gekht is a member of the Russian parliament and head of the Producers' Association. Sokolniki owns a paper factory in Serpuchov near Moscow and a printing plant near Tula. It has a licence from the Russian government to produce bonds and other financial certificates; it needs a steady supply of high-quality cellulose to assure the quality of its special paper.</p>

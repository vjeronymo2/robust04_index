			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LEADERS PROTEST MENTAL HEALTH CENTER EXPANSION  </P> <P> Eastern San Fernando Valley community and church leaders spoke out Saturday  against plans to almost double the capacity of a residential mental health  facility in Lake View Terrace.  </P> <P> "We feel we've already been inundated with this type of facility," said Fred  Taylor, president of Focus '90, an organization that is working with the  Ministers Fellowship of the Greater San Fernando Valley to improve the area's  image.  </P> <P> "This area has become a slum, a dumping ground," said the Rev. James Wade,  pastor of the Universal Church of the Valley in Pacoima. Wade told the group of  20 civic leaders who attended the meeting that government officials have tried  to locate dumps, mental institutions and prisons in the working-class suburb.  </P> <P> Operators of the Foothill Health and Rehabilitation Center at 12260 Foothill  Blvd. are proposing to expand the center from 220 to 420 beds. David Weiss, the  head of the center, was invited to Saturday's meeting to discuss his plans, but  did not attend.  </P> <P> Weiss could not be reached for comment, but Katherine Barger, an aide to Los  Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, said Weiss told her he couldn't come  to a meeting on a Saturday because of his religion. He is Jewish and it was his  Sabbath. However, he does want to work with the community, Barger said. She  offered to help set up another meeting between Weiss and community leaders.  </P> <P> Taylor said he has identified more than 15 facilities that provide residential  care for the mentally ill in the area.  </P> <P> "There are more," he said. "They're putting them here because they don't want  them in Encino or Woodland Hills."  </P> <P> Taylor said residents already have problems with people who live at the  rehabilitation center. "These people come and go as they please," he said.  "These people are not being treated. They're just being housed."  </P> <P> He and others at the meeting said that center residents loiter, sit and drink  liquor on curbs, fall asleep on homeowners' lawns and often beg for money from  passers-by.  </P> <P> "Our women are afraid to go to church at night," Wade said.  </P> <P> More than one speaker compared plans to expand the center to last year's  ill-fated attempt by the nonprofit Phoenix House to establish a 210-bed  drug-treatment center in the community.  </P> <P> "What we have here is another Phoenix House," said Bill McMillan, president of  the Hansen Hills Homeowners Assn. "We fought Phoenix House and won. And we'll  fight this."  </P> <P> Phoenix House abandoned plans for the drug treatment center because of  opposition from residents.  </P> <P> Lewis Snow, president of the Lake View Terrace Home Owners Assn., said research  into city files showed that a permit for the expansion was granted to the  rehabilitation center in 1987. However, the expansion was not begun and the  permit expired, he said.  </P> <P> Snow said he would send a letter Monday asking that the Los Angeles city  Planning Department inform Weiss that he must reapply for the permit.  </P> <P> "Then, they will have to hold new public hearings on the expansion," he said.  "We must fight this."  </P></p>

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Washington keeps up the pressure / Examining the differing perceptions in the US and Japan on the future of the framework trade deal 'THIS is the rules of the game, not the game itself,' insisted Mr Bowman Cutter, deputy head of the White House's national economic council. Reading from the same book, Mr Roger Altman, deputy Treasury secretary, pronounced: 'It's an agreement about the rules, now we get to play the game.' The rules referred to are the new US-Japan negotiating framework to resolve bilateral issues announced with some fanfare, after all-night bargaining, in Tokyo on Saturday morning. Both men, along with other US officials speaking privately, contend that the agreement, stamping the seal on President Bill Clinton's performance at the Tokyo Group of Seven summit, marks a new dawn in US-Japan relations in which the economic and commercial components assume, as the president wanted, a far more important dimension. The 'framework' agreement for subsequent negotiations is precisely that. It does not establish precise goals for shifts in Japanese macro-economic policy, nor does it lay down criteria by which sectors of the Japanese economy can be made more open to US goods and services, and by extension to those of other countries. But in tough language it lays out a negotiating timetable for these to be achieved and it commits Japan to making what the agreement calls highly significant macro and micro economic policy changes. As such, in the US view, it places Japan under a far tougher obligation than all previous attempts to settle bilateral disputes. On the macro-economic side, the compact envisages mutually supportive policies whereby the US seeks to reduce its budget deficit while Japan aims to cut its global current account surplus. At its current level of about Dollars 130bn (Pounds 86bn), Japan's global current account surplus is equivalent to just over 3 per cent of GNP. The US envisages that this can be reduced, mostly by appropriate fiscal policies, to the target zone in 'four to five years'. The unstated US agenda is that Japan should accomplish this less by its traditional method of front-loading public works spending and more by income tax cuts. While it may seem ironic for an administration that is proposing one of the largest tax increases in US history at home to press the reverse course on Japan, the US view is that this is the most effective means of generating the sort of consumer-led demand in Japan that will suck in imports. What all this might do to the bilateral Japanese trade surplus with the US - Dollars 50bn last year and rising fast - has not been made explicit. A recent estimate by the Washington-based Institute for International Economics contends that a cut to around Dollars 40bn is the most optimistic outcome over a few years. Much may depend on another, more controversial, aspect of the agreement  - its insistence on greater sectoral access for imported products and services. The agreement makes no mention of numerical targets as such. However, it does accept that multiple criteria should be used to accept progress in opening Japanese markets. The US will want to use these criteria to set goals for policy, something the Japanese will resist. Agreements in priority areas are to be reached over the next six months and ratified when the US president and the Japanese prime minister meet early next year, with the balance to be settled at a second get-together next July. After two years both governments will decide whether to extend this framework agreement beyond the autumn of 1995. The five principal components of the sectoral access deal cover: Japanese government procurement, particularly in relation to purchases of foreign computers, supercomputers, satellites, medical technology and telecommunications. Regulatory reform, covering financial services, insurance, the distribution network and competition policy. 'Other major sectors', particularly cars and car parts. Economic harmonisation, addressing issues affecting two-way foreign direct investment, including intellectual property and access to technology. Implementation - the monitoring of existing and future agreements. The US team, led by Mr Cutter and Mr Altman and with substantial contributions from other treasury and trade officials, did not necessarily expect to conclude an agreement in Tokyo, especially with the Japanese elections just over a week away. The Japanese, they report, were particularly tough on the question of exemptions from US trade laws. They may hang tougher still as the sectoral negotiations get serious, which is why the US reserves the right of retaliation under existing trade regulations. Mr Clinton may have made a powerful general case in Tokyo in identifying what he saw as the common cause between Japanese consumers and American workers but the appeal of that cause may fade as the two sides finally take to the field under the new 'rules of the game'.</p>

			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / British senior civil servants second only to Japanese in pay league Britain's civil servants are better paid than almost all their international counterparts, according to a report published today. Only Japan's senior officials are above Whitehall's in the pay league of civil servants in leading states of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, according to the report by the European Policy Forum, a London-based think tank. The forum says UK permanent secretaries - the cream of Whitehall - are paid markedly more than their German, French and US counterparts. The figures, calculated from 1990 pay rates in US dollars at purchasing power parity, are taken from a recent study of senior civil service pay in 11 countries within the OECD carried out by researchers for the Paris-based organisation. The figures also show that during the 1980s UK permanent secretaries were the only top civil servants in the 11 states whose pay rose by more than the rise in per capita GDP, thanks to big increases in 1985 and 1986. Mr Graham Mather, president of the European Policy Forum and a Tory MEP, said: 'These figures end the myth that British top civil servants are paid less than their equivalents overseas and suggest it is time to reassess their performance criteria.' At Dollars 125,000 in 1990, the basic salaries of British permanent secretaries are shown by the study to be just behind Japanese levels. By contrast, counterparts in France were paid Dollars 70,000, in the US Dollars 90,000 and in Germany Dollars 100,000. In a submission to Mr David Hunt, minister for public service, the think tank calls on the government to abandon plans for a special new top pay scale, to start in April, which would cover permanent secretaries and Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary. Permanent secretaries are paid Pounds 95,000 a year and Sir Robin Pounds 118,000. In his submission to Mr Hunt, Mr Mather claims it would be 'great political folly' to introduce a 'super pay league' until 'clear policy target agreements' are established. Ms Liz Symons, general secretary of the First Division Association of senior civil servants, said: 'Other countries have not got career civil servants of our kind, so comparisons are very difficult.'

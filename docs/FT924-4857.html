			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Encounter in Edinburgh The central question facing next week's European summit in Edinburgh is whether the member states wish, or indeed are any longer able, to keep alive the Community model of European integration as we have known it for the past 40 years. No doubt all or most of the original six founder members would wish to do so, and perhaps also Spain and Portugal. But the pressure of circumstances, and contrary pulls in other directions, may make it impossible. This fundamental question will underlie two of the most important items of the agenda: the Danish problem, and the issue of the future enlargement of the EC. The way these two issues are handled may well, between them, mark the end of the Community as we know it. The conventional wisdom is that the Danish problem is insoluble; in fact, it may be easily soluble, but only by setting a deeply damaging precedent for the future of the Community. The Danes have asked for exemptions from some of the far-reaching ambitions of the Maastricht treaty, including monetary union and the eventual development of a common defence; and they want these exemptions to be given legally binding form. Many people assume that the words 'legally binding' would require a change in the Maastricht treaty; but since the other member states have ruled out any renegotiation, the Danes will have to scale back their demands, and solve 'their' problem on their own. This is precisely what they may do. The obvious precedent is the 1963 Franco-German Treaty of Friendship and Co-operation. President de Gaulle of France intended the treaty to introduce a new Franco-German priority into the policy of the Federal Republic. But when the Bundestag ratified the treaty, it tacked on a preamble which said, in effect: 'This treaty does not diminish our commitment to Nato or our friendship with the US.' De Gaulle was furious. The lesson is simple. The Danes can simply put a new bill through their own parliament, to say, in effect: 'None of the following commitments in the Maastricht treaty applies to us.' This would be 'legally binding' in Denmark, but not on the rest of the Community: problem solved, QED. At that point, Maastricht may be ratifiable in Denmark; it may even be ratifiable in Britain, if Mr John Major ever recovers some authority over his party. But in either event the treaty will have been voided of much of its substance, by the unilateral action of one member state. The enlargement of the EC, as discussed in a recent publication*, is now assumed to be inevitable, just because there are so many qualified candidates waiting at the door. Norway last week added its name to the list, which includes Austria, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Cyprus and Malta. Until now, the applications have been stalled by the trials and tribulations of Maastricht. But once the treaty is ratified, the EC can start to negotiate with the candidates. It is not clear, however, that these candidates can join without jeopardising the EC's future development. A case in point is the treaty objective of a common foreign and security policy (CFSP). The Commission has said that no country should be admitted which is not committed to the objective of a CFSP; but four of the five leading candidates are or have been neutral. If Denmark (which is in Nato) can sign up for a common defence, and then write itself an opt-out, it will be hard to demand any foreign policy commitment from the Swedes or the Swiss. The trouble with the treaty is that the heart of it consists of programmes for future action. Some are precise, such as the programme for monetary union; and some are vague, such as the aim of a CFSP. But the common assumption is that this is a homogeneous Community of reasonably like-minded states, all more or less committed to the programme. If the Danes, the British or the Germans give themselves let-outs in advance, then the treaty is as leaky as a colander. It might be logical to admit members before negotiating a Maastricht-type programme; or after it had been implemented; but not in the middle. More seriously, the admission of a large number of members must change the general character of the EC; the neutrality of the candidates is less important than their size and number. At the simplest level, it is obvious that policy decision-making will be more difficult in a Community of 17 than in one of 12; a Community of 25 will largely cease to take any decisions. One possible response would be more majority voting; the problem is that majority voting is only easily manageable in a homogeneous group, whereas enlargement necessarily means less homogeneity. Finland is much more different from Greece than Belgium is from Holland. The essentially universalist characteristic of the EC in the past was that all member states took part in all decision-making. The programme for monetary union in the Maastricht treaty marks the beginning of variable speed policies in action; large-scale enlargement will spell the end of universalist decision-making, and thus the end of the Community as we have known it. * The European Community: the Challenge of Enlargement by Anna Michalski and Helen Wallace, Chatham House, 10 St James's Sq, SW1</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Politics fuels China's worries about financing ON JULY 4 last year, after 'friendly discussions' between British and Chinese officials, a memorandum of understanding giving the go-ahead for Hong Kong's multi-billion dollar airport and related projects was initialled. What exists now is a memorandum but no understanding. If the complaints about the project levelled by Mr Chen Zou'er - Beijing's Number 2 official on Hong Kong matters - represent China's true concerns then there is an awful lot more talking to do before agreement is reached. The two main components of Asia's biggest infrastructure project are the airport itself and a new railway line. Kai Tek, the colony's current international airport, will reach capacity limits in 1994 or 1995 and the new airport, sited at Chek Lap Kok, north of Lantau island, will provide for expansion through to 2040. The railway will offer a high speed service from the airport to the urban areas of Hong Kong and will help relieve congestion on the busiest part of its existing network. The need for the project is agreed by both sides but, bluster aside, China appears to have serious reservations. These are not only about the total financing bill, but also about the financial viability of the planned railway and various financial incentives the Hong Kong government plans to offer the key corporations building the project. Certainly the cost of the airport has risen. In less than a year it rose nearly 14 per cent in real terms to HKDollars 112.2bn from HKDollars 98.6bn and threatens to reach HKDollars 175.3bn in current terms by the time it is completed. In addition, the government is prepared to stump up HKDollars 20.3bn in 'callable equity' - HKDollars 7.8bn for the Airport Authority and HKDollars 12.5bn for the MTRC in the event of project delay or poor economic circumstances. But the Chinese regard it as a contingent liability on the future government of Hong Kong. Hong Kong officials say these concerns are either soluble or unfounded. The airport will be self-financing by day one; the MTRC has already convinced bankers to back the project. However, they say, every time they raise specifics the Chinese fall back on generalities. Nearly three weeks ago, China made an offer to the UK. It could go ahead and award a HKDollars 8bn-HKDollars 10bn contract for the preparation of the airport site, while keeping open talks on all other matters. Last Thursday the UK made a counter offer. Approve the financing for the airport and leave to later discussion China's concerns about the railway. 'Provided we can do a deal on the whole airport package the issue of callable equity is something we can deal with. But we are not prepared to put that offer on the table and have them come back with four or five other claims,' said one senior official. What lies behind the official's concern is that neither he, nor anyone in Hong Kong familiar with the discussions, believes finance is the real sticking point anyway. They think China is withholding its consent because it is concerned that Mr Chris Patten, the colony's new governor, will include the liberal Mr Martin Lee's United Democrats, the stand-bearers of greater participatory democracy, in his cabinet. Democratic 'contamination' from Hong Kong both before and after 1997 keeps Beijing's communist rulers awake at night. So far Mr Patten has kept his counsel; he has taken the propaganda war to the Chinese, never failing to point out that the airport is in Hong Kong's and southern China's interest. However he is aware that he has things to do on the political front, including the reshaping of his cabinet. The day he opens the next session of the legislature - October 7 - may prove critical for the airport as well.</p>

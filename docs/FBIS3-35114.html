			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Walid Abi-Murshid: "Iran Demands Lebanese </F> Companies Employ Its `Sympathizers'"]    [Text] London -- A well informed Lebanese source has  revealed that a group of establishments and companies operating  in Lebanon recently received specific requests from Tehran that  a number of its political "sympathizers" be employed in their  administrative or technical departments.    The Lebanese source said that Iran offered to provide a  number of establishments having commercial dealings with it with  official cover when necessary for employing the elements in  their departments, for example, by providing official  notification confirming they are representatives of known  Iranian establishments.    The Lebanese source noted that what he terms Iranian trade  infiltration in Lebanon comes in the wake of increasing reports  about the possibility that Hizballah will dissolve its military  wing in the event that the Israeli forces withdraw from southern  Lebanon within the framework of a comprehensive peace process in  the region, and the possibility of withdrawing "Revolutionary  Guard" elements from al-Biqa'.    It is worth mentioning that a leading Lebanese Hizballah  source announced in Beirut yesterday that the party has drawn up  a plan to confront what the source termed "consequences of  peace" with Israel if it is achieved. The source said that even  if its military is dissolved, Hizballah will retain its social  and security organs and will fight any attempt to "normalize"  relations with Israel.    A Lebanese ministerial source stresses that the Israeli  forces' withdrawal from southern Lebanon would not be the end of  Hizballah's role on the Lebanese scene, but, rather, the  beginning of a new political role whose foundation is the  mobilization of popular opposition against attempts to normalize  unofficial relations with Israel.    The source adds that Hizballah would lead the tendency  calling for turning the Lebanese-Israeli peace -- if established  -- into a cold peace along the lines of the Egyptian-Israeli  peace.</p>

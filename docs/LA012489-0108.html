			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROBERTI APPOINTMENTS REFLECT LITTLE CHANGE  </P> <P> There were no major changes in leadership Monday as Senate President Pro Tem  David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) announced appointments of senators to 24  standing committees for the new legislative session.  </P> <P> The Rules Committee, which Roberti chairs, did create one new five-member  committee, Veterans Affairs, which will be headed by Sen. Wadie P. Deddeh  (D-Bonita).  </P> <P> Deddeh previously chaired the Transportation Committee, but was demoted last  year because he voted for confirmation of Republican Rep. Daniel E. Lungren of  Long Beach, Gov. George Deukmejian's first choice for the vacant state  treasurer's job. He was replaced as head of the Transportation Committee by  Sen. Quentin I. Kopp (I-San Francisco), who cast a key vote with the majority  against Lungren.  </P> <P> Chairing the Senate's committees will be 21 Democrats, two Republicans and  Kopp, the Senate's only Independent. Democrats outnumber Republicans in the  upper house, 24-15.  </P> <P> The two GOP committee heads are Sens. Marian Bergeson of Newport Beach,  chairwoman of the Local Government Committee, and Edward R. Royce of Anaheim,  who chairs the Constitutional Amendments panel. Kopp continues as chairman of  the Transportation Committee.  </P> <P> Regarding the new Veterans Affairs Committee to be headed by Deddeh, Roberti  said: "Issues affecting veterans in California are growing with each day and  are becoming more complex. It is fitting that the Senate deal with these  matters on a regular basis through the standing committee process."  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) downgraded  the Assembly Veterans Affairs Committee to a subcommittee because, according to  an aide, Brown felt the panel did not have enough bills to consider.  </P></p>

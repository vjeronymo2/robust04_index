			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / GEC raises stakes in battle with BAe for VSEL GEC, which is battling with British Aerospace for control of the submarine maker VSEL, has sent selected MPs a document damning BAe's record, in spite of giving the Ministry of Defence an undertaking that it would not enter into a public war of words with Britain's biggest defence contractor. The paper, which attacks BAe's record as a prime contractor and complains that in other respects the company is 'not particularly distinguished', is a response to a BAe bid document published last week through the Stock Exchange, which strongly attacked GEC. GEC's document has been labelled private and confidential and has not been made available to shareholders, unlike BAe's, though it answers point-by-point BAe's bid document. The Takeover Panel, which polices takeover battles, permits private lobbying of MPs but would want any important financial information to be circulated to shareholders during the course of the bid. GEC is convinced it is not in breach of takeover panel rules. GEC slams BAe's financial record, saying that in the past 3 1/2 years BAe has had a cash outflow of Pounds 2.5bn, and made Pounds 1.5bn in provisions. In the same period BAe has had operating profits which are less than 1 per cent of its Pounds 35bn turnover. The document also says: 'The effect of BAe's acquisition of VSEL would be that those resources (VSEL's net cash of Pounds 288m) would be absorbed in covering the cash outflow arising from the large losses accruing in other parts of its business.' It adds that the deal would 'weaken its (VSEL's) financial, and therefore, competitive position'. Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, said last night: 'This smacks of hole in the corner tactics. I'm astounded that if GEC wants to make these claims they haven't been circulated to VSEL's shareholders.' GEC also contrasts its own position as 'an international group with manufacturing businesses throughout the world' with the 'negligible overseas manufacturing capability' of BAe. The paper says: 'GEC estimates that half of BAe's total defence business and some two-thirds of its defence exports are dependent on a single Middle Eastern customer (Saudi Arabia through the Al Yamamah contract).' The document counters BAe's assertions that a GEC takeover of VSEL would go against the MoD's competition policy, and it also denies that shipbuilding would be left largely in the hands of one company. The document is part of the behind-the-scenes war of words being conducted by the two companies in what many observers think is a dry run for a takeover bid for BAe by GEC. Before GEC countered BAe's original bid worth Pounds 478m for VSEL with its own offer worth Pounds 532m, it agreed with the MoD that it would not launch public attacks on BAe. The MoD is understood to be concerned that open warfare between the two companies would erode foreign customer confidence in BAe. GEC has made no secret of its desire to merge BAe's defence interests with its own, and covets BAe's position as the prime contracting company controlling such large projects as the Eurofighter, the four-nation advanced jet. GEC also says its strong finances make it a more natural leader for such prime roles. BAe, however, has privately attacked GEC's record in running large programmes such as the Nimrod airborne radar and the Spearfish torpedo programmes, saying that they show GEC is not capable of being a prime contractor.</p>

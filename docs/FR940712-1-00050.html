In a 1983 administrative appeal decision, the FS determined that the formula used to determine fair market rental for communication site use was not in compliance with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) (43 U.S.C. 1701 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The formula used at that time was two-tenths (0.2) of 1 percent of the permittee's investment plus 5 percent of the rental fees received by the FS permittee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The formula has remained unchanged for about 40 years, as have FS rental payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1985, the FS adopted a new policy for setting rental payments. Under that policy, communication use rental fees were to be based on (1) a fee schedule, (2) individual site appraisals, or (3) competitive bidding. In 1989, the FS implemented regional schedules under that policy. Proposed rentals generated opposition from industry groups_primarily television and radio broadcasters_and complaints to Congress. At the same time, efforts by certain BLM State Offices to increase rental payments caused similar complaints to Congress.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To forestall significant increases in rental payments, Congress enacted a moratorium prohibiting any increases in rental fees above those in effect on January 1, 1989. This affected both agencies. The FS was also asked to review the schedules, with particular emphasis on their impact on rural communities in the Western United States, and to report their findings to the congressional Appropriations Committees. The report was submitted to Congress in 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The BLM and FS entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in April 1991. The MOU provides for cooperation to develop and implement similar methods for determining rental fees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In November 1991, the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act limited increases in communication site fees in Fiscal Year 1992 to 15 percent over the levels in effect on January 1, 1989. The conference report also directed both the FS and BLM jointly to establish a broad-based advisory group.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to that direction, an advisory group, the Radio and Television Broadcast Use Fee Advisory Committee, was established, which included BLM, FS, and representatives from the broadcast industry (users of both public and private communication sites). The advisory committee prepared and submitted a report to the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture in December 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The advisory committee report made several recommendations. These included use of rental schedules instead of individual appraisals for setting rental payments, acceptance of industry-recognized market ranking systems, a phase-in period for rent increases greater than $1,000, a provision for charging 25 percent of the gross sublease income, and annual increases based on the Consumer Price Index (Urban Consumer, U.S. City Average).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The advisory committee also recommended a specific rental schedule. The schedule included a discount of 30 percent from estimated rental value to account for perceived difficulties in obtaining use authorizations on Federal lands. The advisory committee report indicated that the rental schedule did not reflect fair market value, and it was required to be amended by BLM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 13, 1993, the FS published a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice of proposed policy (``Fee Schedule for Communication Uses'') and invited comments. The FS proposed to adopt a revised rental schedule for television broadcast, FM radio broadcast, commercial mobile radio, and cellular telephone uses on National Forest System lands. The proposed schedule would supplement individual FS regional schedules adopted in 1989 and modified in 1992. The regional schedules of the FS recognize 13 types of communication uses. They include (1) radio broadcast, (2) television broadcast, (3) broadcast translator, (4) cable and subscription television, (5) mobile radio-commercial communications, (6) cellular telephone, (7) common carrier microwave relay, (8) industrial microwave relay, (9) mobile radio-internal communications, (10) natural resource/environmental monitoring, (11) passive reflector, (12) amateur radio, and (13) personal/private receive only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In August 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (Act) was signed into law. The Act directed the BLM and FS to assess and collect in 1994 an annual rental payment 10 percent above the rent paid in 1993. For most right-of-way holders required to pay rent, this was the first increase since 1989.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

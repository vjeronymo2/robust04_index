			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE AND MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES EMIGRE ORCHESTRA AT EBELL  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Emigre Virtuoso Orchestra is more emigre than virtuoso, as  Sunday night's hodgepodge program in Wilshire Ebell Theatre amply demonstrated.  Still, under the no-nonsense guidance of music director Armen Garabedian, it's  a solid ensemble capable of making its musical points when given the chance.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, there wasn't much of a chance.  </P> <P> Soloists dominated the evening. Violinist Daniel Shindaryov offered the Violin  Concerto No. 4 by Paganini, a work that has little to do with music, more to do  with empty virtuosic display.  </P> <P> Although Shindaryov handled much of its finger-twisting, bow-bending  technicalities with impressive dexterity, there were enough rough edges to  suggest that he (and we) might have been better off with a different piece. His  cool approach proved welcome in the music's sentimental moments, yet overall it  made for uninvolving listening.  </P> <P> Pianist Khachik Kyurkchian, despite the occasional stumble, brought surprising  bravura, decisive accents and impetuosity to Chopin's E-minor Concerto; he also  knew how to give lyrical passages strong direction and spontaneity. The  orchestra accompanied dutifully and sloppily in the Paganini, with greater  attentiveness and warmth in Chopin.  </P> <P> Garabedian began the concert with Beethoven's "Egmont" Overture in a clean but  overemphatic and constricted reading; he concluded with the romping vulgarities  of Khatchaturian's "Sabre Dance," fleetly and pointedly played.TIMOTHY MANGAN  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency received several comments on the proposed California enforcement exemptions, all of which were generally supportive of the regulation. Most of these comments also suggested various modifications and clarifications of the proposed regulations. In this final rule the Agency is promulgating a revised version of the California enforcement exemptions regulation, which includes many of the modifications recommended by commenters. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 43 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A detailed discussion of these comments, the Agency's responses to these comments, and the modifications made to the proposed rule is contained in a separate ``Responses to Comments'' document. The following is a summary of the more significant changes made to the proposed rule:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 43 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency has re-analyzed the relative emission reduction benefits of the California Phase II reformulated gasoline program and the federal Phase I program, using the complex model being promulgated today, and has again concluded that the California program is at least as stringent as the federal program. The analysis also found that fuel meeting the standards of the California Phase II program has a greater VOC, NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  and toxic performance reduction than fuel meeting the federal reformulated gasoline Phase I standards. A copy of this analysis has been placed in the rulemaking docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed exclusion from the enforcement exemptions of small refiners who are granted a two-year extension under the California program has been dropped from the final rule. The Agency has determined that the emissions performance of fuels meeting the California reformulated gasoline standards to which these refiners will be subject during the two-year period, in conjunction with the statewide California sulfur standard, meets or exceeds the performance required under the Phase I federal reformulated gasoline program, as measured by the complex model (which may be used to determine compliance with federal standards during this period <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 44 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). An analysis of these standards has been placed in the rulemaking docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 44 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Use of the complex model is optional until the end of 1997, and mandatory thereafter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The enforcement exemptions have been extended to California reformulated gasoline produced at refineries located outside of California that produce only California reformulated gasoline and federal conventional gasoline (i.e., that do not produce federal reformulated gasoline). The primary rationale for excluding such gasoline, that its producer would be required to implement all of the federal enforcement provisions for a refinery's non-California reformulated gasoline, is not applicable to facilities that do not produce federal reformulated gasoline. In order to assure that such gasoline is in fact shipped to, and sold in, California, section 80.81(g) of the final regulations now prescribes transfer documentation and record keeping requirements for such gasoline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The compliance survey exemption is extended to all gasoline subject to the California reformulated gasoline regulations (no matter where produced) and will not be lost by a party who otherwise loses its California enforcement exemptions (e.g., a refiner who violates federal or state reformulated gasoline regulations or whose gasoline formulation is found to be less stringent than the federal requirements). The purpose of compliance surveys is to ensure that each area receiving reformulated gasoline receives gasoline that, on average, achieves the performance that would be expected if per-gallon compliance was the only available compliance option. The Agency believes that there would be little purpose served in imposing this requirement on only a small subset of the gasoline sold in California.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Exemptions from the following enforcement provisions have been added in the final rule: the parameter value reconciliation requirements in section 80.65(e)(2); the reformulated gasoline and RBOB compliance requirements in section 80.65(c); the annual compliance audit requirements in section 80.65(h); and the compliance attest engagement requirements in subpart F. The Agency believes that these exemptions are consistent with the rationale for the exemptions proposed in the NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / South African MPs vote to end minority rule: Deadlock remains over attempt to draw black and white right wing into constitutional process The South African parliament yesterday voted formally to end three centuries of white minority rule, adopting a non-racial constitution despite opposition from black and white right-wing groups. Cries of 'traitor' broke out from the parliamentary seats of the ultra-right Conservative Party, while independent legislators who support the African National Congress shouted 'amandla', or power, foreshadowing the bitter political battles to be fought before next April's multi-racial elections. Though negotiators from the government, the ANC and the right-wing parties managed to avoid a permanent rupture when last minute talks ended on the eve of the vote, their negotiations remain at an impasse. In three days of intensive talks this week, no substantive progress was made to persuade the right wing to accept the transition to majority rule. The negotiators' main achievement was to open the door to continued talks, with a new deadline of January 24 for agreeing amendments to the constitution passed yesterday in parliament. 'The process never ends,' government chief negotiator Roelf Meyer said at the literal and metaphorical midnight hour when the deadline passed for amending the constitution before yesterday's vote. Indeed, the process has not ended: negotiators from the Freedom Alliance, the right wing umbrella group, will take a proposal to their principals to allow talks to resume in the new year. But that proposal covers only the process, not the substance of a deal: it would commit the Alliance to participate in elections and the Transitional Executive Council, if their constitutional demands were met. But it goes no way toward dealing with the substance of those demands. While the Inkatha Freedom Party, one of the most important Alliance members, has reached a measure of agreement with the government on amending the constitution to increase the powers of regions, less common ground seems to exist with the ANC. With the balance of power having decisively shifted toward the ANC after adoption of what is close to a majority rule constitution, no deal can be done with the Freedom Alliance unless the ANC supports it. Some political analysts doubt the ANC's bona fides in seeking a deal with Inkatha. It seems more committed to placating the white right wing. There is no doubt that further delay acts to the short-term political advantage of the ANC and the government, whose election campaign plans are well advanced, and to the detriment of those parties who formally enter the race at a later stage (parties must lodge election lists in February). The ANC and the government are apparently hoping the delay will further strain the Freedom Alliance, and cause it to split - the best possible outcome for them as politicians. But if, as the rhetoric from both sides suggests, they are also keen to act as statesmen and ensure an all-inclusive constitutional settlement, their tactics of brinkmanship and ultimatums may yet backfire. Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi of Inkatha is unpredictable at the best of times, never more so than when his back is against the wall. Many ANC and government negotiators seem strangely unconcerned by Chief Buthelezi's ability to disrupt the election, if he finally decides to boycott it. ANC officials worry more about the threat from the white right wing, especially the Conservative Party and the paramilitary Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement) - but they were not concerned enough to ensure that constitutional amendments on Afrikaner self-determination went into the constitution, to give effect to an important ANC/right wing declaration of intent on an Afrikaner homeland. That deal was to have been signed on Tuesday, but it fell apart when the broader right wing talks failed. Some ANC negotiators say they believe that Inkatha and much of the white right will participate in elections, whether or not their constitutional concerns are met, and that it is not worth giving away too much to woo parties who have no realistic option but to fight elections anyway.</p>

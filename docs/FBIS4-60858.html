			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku, April 29 (TURAN)--As was earlier reported, on  April 26 the leader of the Azeri Parliament, Rasul Guliyev, and  Russian Defense Minister, Pavel Grachev, had discussed  military-strategic cooperation between the two countries.    They agreed on the usage of a radio-transmitting station  located in the Gabala region of Azerbaijan.    The discussions were over the status of the station and the  number of hours of broadcasting. Discussions have been ongoing  since 1993.    Moscow's TURAN's correspondent was told by Russian military  sources that during the talks Rasul Guliyev agreed to lease the  station to the Russian Defense Ministry.    The Russian Defense Minister said that in the near future  Azerbaijan's and Russia's governments will ratify the document  concerning the functioning of the Gabala radio-transmitting  station. Sources from the Russian Defense Ministry report that  the station will be assigned the status equivalent of a Russian  military base on the territory of Azerbaijan.    The Gabala station was built in the mid-1980's within the  framework of the Soviet-version of S.D.I. (Strategic Defense  Initiative).    The station provides for the capability to establish a fixed  launching of intercontinental ballistic missiles or any other  objects in the southern sector of the globe.    According to Russian military experts, the Gabala station is  the most needed station in anti-aircraft programmes of the  former Soviet Union, and now Russia.    As was learned earlier, in the past, Russian Defense  Minister  Grachev announced his intention to station 5 military bases in  the Caucasus, three in Georgia, one in Armenia and one in  Azerbaijan.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Test Range" program: Report over video of "top </F> secret" Mi-28 combat helicopter]    [Text] [Unidentified correspondent over video of closeups  of Mi-28 helicopter] What you see on your screens is the new  top secret Mi-28 combat helicopter which was conceived at the  Mil Design Bureau. This machine, which is still shrouded in  secrecy, has already managed to acquire a nickname -- "tank  buster."    [Donald Duck-type voice] Thanks for the warning.    [Correspondent] It does not hurt to know that, as regards  combat equipment, the Mi-28 helicopter is without parallel in  the world.    [Donald Duck-type voice] The U.S. Apache helicopter in  comparison with ours does not do very much.    [Correspondent] The powerful 30-mm gun with which the Mi-28  is fitted can turn 220 degrees and destroy armored targets over  a distance of 3 km with ease.    [Donald Duck-type voice] Quite right. Don't let anyone get  closer. Moscow is right behind us.    [Correspondent] In addition it would not be fair to withhold  from potential enemies that the helicopter is equipped with top  class Shturm and Ataka guided missiles. Ninety-nine times out  of a hundred there is no getting away from them. In addition  there is also a variety of other projectiles, 500-kg bombs, and  also a device for laying mines.    [Donald Duck-type voice] Armed to its teeth, you might say.    [Correspondent] It is no accident that, in line with its  image, the Mi-28 is listed in the British Jane's Defense Data  reference book under the code name Havoc [in English as heard],  which in Russian would be destroyer [razrushitel].    [Donald Duck-voice] Just as well it is not the Ripper  [potrashitel].    [Correspondent] On the other hand, this top class helicopter  is very difficult to destroy in combat. The crew is protected  against the enemy by an armored cockpit and armored glass.    [Donald Duck-voice] Quite right, look after your own, let  the others be frightened.    [Correspondent] Should someone nonetheless succeed in  downing our falcons, special gear will enable them to crash-land  from the height of a five-storey building without a parachute  and without contracting a headache. However the greatest cause  of joy for our enemies will be the Mi-28 helicopter's  sensational flight performance. It appears that it can fly  sideways, back to front, and even elegantly loop the loop.    [Donald Duck-type voice] Could the pilot be Nesterov's  grandson?    [Correspondent] Quite possible. Who else could withstand  loads of around three g's?    [Donald Duck-type voice] What does that mean?    [Correspondent] I have no idea, but I was told that it is  very steep.    [Donald Duck-type voice] And the instruments? [as heard]    [Correspondent] Six. [as heard]    [Donald Duck-type voice] What six? [as heard]    [Correspondent] What instruments? [as heard]</p>

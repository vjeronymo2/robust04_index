			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Chance to blaze regulatory trail Sir, Your leader 'Sizing up the watchdogs' (April 15) argues the case for moderation in changing regulatory regimes of the energy, water and telecommunications industries. For the most part, I would agree with you and with Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, that an evolutionary approach is preferable to some more extreme ideas now being suggested. I also agree that an all powerful regulatory giant, sitting astride the whole process, would be highly undesirable. If anything, we should be aiming to dilute the current concentration of power in regulatory hands rather than adding to it. In particular, it would be wrong to lump in telecommunications with the utilities. Telecommunications regulation is a transitional process, while competitors establish themselves in what is now a fully open market. We already have a decade of experience behind us. The utilities are relatively recent arrivals on the scene and their regulation can be expected to be a permanent feature, as there will always be a strong element of monopoly in their markets. Oftel provided the original experiment in UK regulation and there is an opportunity to use it again to blaze the trail for the next stage of regulatory evolution. There are a number of reasons why a judicious review of the Oftel framework would be timely. First, 10 years without any review is a long time. Second, it is becoming increasingly clear that separate regulation of telecommunications and broadcasting makes little sense when the two industries are evidently converging. Third, a framework designed essentially to cater for a duopoly in telecommunications sits uncomfortably in a market with a multiplicity of participants. A review of Oftel for these reasons would offer the government the opportunity, at the same time, to try out some of the more sensible proposals for reform that are now being advocated - such as more explicit regulatory objectives, greater transparency, less concentration of power in one individual, and possibly even a 'short cut' review procedure at the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. But, as Sir Bryan wisely counsels, such a review should reinforce and not undermine the current separation of powers between regulator and department of state.

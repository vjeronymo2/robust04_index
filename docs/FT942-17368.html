			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / International Company News: Revco pays Dollars 600m to acquire rival Revco, one of the US's biggest drug store chains, said it was acquiring rival chain Hook-SupeRx for Dollars 600m in a deal which signals a further consolidation in the drug distribution business in the US. Both groups are based in Ohio and each has about 1,200 stores, making them together one of the largest retail drug chains alongside Rite-Aid and Walgreen. Revco said it had reached agreement to buy Hook for Dollars 13.75 a share, a 50 per cent premium over the Dollars 9.125 at which the company's shares closed at last Thursday. Hook's shares jumped to Dollars 12.625 yesterday, reflecting lingering doubts that Revco would not be able to complete the acquisition. Revco, which emerged from bankruptcy in 1992, said it was still assessing the financing for the deal, and that the transaction was dependent on its ability to raise up to Dollars 175m through a debenture issue. It said it had received commitments for bank debt to back the deal, and a standby purchase agreement from its largest shareholder to back an equity issue. The uncertainties surrounding healthcare reform in the US and the pressure on profit margins of both producers and distributors has begun to force consolidation in the drug industry's various distribution channels. In the biggest transaction to date, Merck, the country's biggest manufacturer, acquired telephone distribution company Medco for Dollars 6bn. Hook had sales of Dollars 2.3bn last year, almost identical to Revco. Mr Dwayne Hoven, president and chief executive of Revco, said the takeover was intended principally to strengthen the company's position in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia and Tennessee, as well as giving it a position in a range of other states where it does not operate.</p>

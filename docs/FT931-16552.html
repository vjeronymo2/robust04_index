			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Arts: Two cheers for the Wigmore Hall - Music in 1992 First, the praises of the renewed Wigmore Hall must be sung. Music-lovers have missed the place sorely since July last year. The Purcell Room, though recently much improved, remains a second-best London venue for solo recitals, chamber music and song (roughly equal with St. John's, Smith Square, which has different virtues and drawbacks). We never doubted Bill Lyne's word that the Hall itself would be left sacrosanct - just cleaned, and freshly re-pointed. The complementary pleasure is the new cafe-bar-restaurant downstairs, handsomely designed and comfortable (excellent caterers, too). No Wigmore regular will think that a 'mere' luxury, remembering the Dante-esque scenes in the old foyer whenever the house was sold out. There is room, however, for a seasonal quibble: on the new marketing policy, very few Bob Cratchits will get into any of the main concerts. This is because seat-booking is now locked into an elaborate scheme of priorities. Should there be an artist or a programme that you particularly want to hear, just being quick off the mark will not be enough - for a large part of this small hall is reserved, months in advance, for people who have the time and the money to commit themselves to a whole series of concerts. Though one can recognise the commercial sense in that, it is hard on anyone whose time and/or money need careful husbanding. With the new glamour of the place, I foresee the 'House Full' sign going up more often than ever, and thriftier music-lovers all but excluded. A thought which the management might consider for future seasons: what about persuading the most popular artists to stay on for a second, non-series recital? There are not a few performers who could fill the hall twice over, even with the same programme. As for series that qualify as 'festivals', this year has been notably rich in them, from the BBC's Alban Berg mini-festival in January to the Barbican's triumphant celebration of Scandinavian music this month and last. These affairs get better and better planned, unrecognisably better than the grab-bags that were billed as 'festivals' just three or four years ago. I was inclined to be sniffy about them, but they are becoming major attractions of every season now. Even the much-reduced Almeida Festival scored effectively with its choice of new chamber-operas in July, though the concerts were hit-and-miss; and Andras Schiff's 'Contrasts' series managed to sell a lot of dangerously recent music to his devoted audience, who are not by nature avant-gardists. Only the London Sinfonietta, that band of dedicated modernists, has failed to strike lucky as often as it deserves. For all their canny programming (their retrospective sweep through past commissions, has been thoroughly impressive) and reliably brilliant playing, the Queen Elizabeth Hall is frequently under-filled for them - audiences are enthusiastic, but not numerous. It might be the recession; but the most striking thing about public music in London has been how very many people do keep crowding into the South Bank halls, the Barbican, the Wigmore, not to mention the opera houses. Music is a solace, of course] - but compared with New York or Paris or Vienna we would seem to be wildly over-supplied with it. Yet, apparently, we are not.</p>

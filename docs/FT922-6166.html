			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Mr Lamont's objective THE RE-ELECTION of the Conservatives did not resolve the dilemmas of British economic policy. It merely changed the time horizon. The government is now able to take a strategic perspective. Such a perspective would be unnecessary if there were no choices left to make. But there are a few, even if the unmentionables - leaving the ERM or a realignment of sterling - are ignored. With sterling in the wide bands, the government can vary interest rates a little and public spending and taxation rather more. The question is what to do with its freedom. The chancellor of the exchequer has given his answer. He told the annual dinner of the Confederation of British Industry last week that Britain should aim to match Japan's inflation performance, which is about 2 per cent, if it wants to be 'a first-rank commercial power'. This sounds very attractive. But one might ask whether a current account deficit of Pounds 3.2bn in the first four months of 1992, for much of which the economy was in the seventh successive quarter of decline, is consistent with being a 'first-rank commercial power'. The official view is that the external position of a country is of no significance. Since the authorities also argued that the monetary expansion between 1986 and 1988 was a private phenomenon of limited policy concern, this view is not convincing. A 'first rate commercial power' in recession, but with a current account deficit, probably needs a real exchange rate depreciation. With realignments ruled out, low inflation is the sole route to that goal. Mr Lamont's target for inflation is not mere hubris. It is a goal that must be achieved, the sooner the better. Necessary pain This suggests that the high interest rates of today, not to mention efforts to put public spending back under control, represent necessary pain. So should Mr Lamont whisper sotto voce thanks for the monetary consequences of German unification and watch as British inflation - now merely back to where it was before the Lawson boom - is slowly dragged down to respectable levels? After all, under today's 5 per cent underlying rate of inflation, sterling would lose three quarters of its purchasing power in 30 years. This is not respectable. His choice is not so simple. What has made the disinflationary process effective is also what makes it so dangerous: the consequences of high interest rates on an economy whose banks, property companies and households took a huge bet on inflation not so many years ago. Mountleigh is the latest, but certainly not the last casualty from that period. Debt deflation There is only one answer to debt deflation: low short term interest rates, the answer supplied by the Federal Reserve in the US. But the sluggish US recovery suggests that a powerful debt deflation can only be overcome by a far more aggressive central bank than anything on offer in the UK. So what should the government choose: as much monetary restraint as possible, to get inflation down, or as little as possible, to get the economy moving again? Lower interest rates do appear desirable. Disinflation is in train, whatever happens to interest rates in the short to medium term. Maybe interest rates can even fall a sliver below German levels, which are themselves unlikely to fall for quite a while. High German interest rates do at least virtually guarantee that the loosening in the UK will not be overdone. Yet whatever the government now chooses, the legacy it inherits from its own and its predecessor's errors ensures that the outcome will be unhappy: underlying inflation will not fall as fast as the government hopes; recovery will not be as strong as it might wish. More important still, even when underlying inflation has at last been driven down to low levels, strong growth may well not ensue. Like the British public, the government has taken a gamble. The public bet on inflation. The government has bet on the ERM. It has bet that the weak balance of payments position will not constrain future growth; it has bet as well that a heavily indebted economy will return to health despite high real interest rates. Only time will tell whether the gamble will work. Even a newly re-elected government can only do a little more than hope.</p>

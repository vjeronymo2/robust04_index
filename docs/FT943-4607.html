			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Lloyd's plans to improve run-offs Lloyd's of London has unveiled proposals to increase the efficiency of 'run-offs' - the management of claims faced by syndicates no longer underwriting new business. According to a consultative document issued yesterday, companies managing run-offs will need minimum capital of Pounds 250,000 rising by stages to Pounds 400,000 for 1999 onwards - the same minimum capital standards as agents which manage syndicates, Lloyd's is also proposing to review the experience and qualifications of run-off company staff and will demand that run-off companies deploy effective computer systems. Run-off costs amounted to Pounds 135m in 1993.</p>

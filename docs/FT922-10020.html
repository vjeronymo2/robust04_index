			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Hong Kong (7): Ambitious plan takes off - The new airport SYMBOL of renewed confidence in the future of Hong Kong, or simply a monument to the British Empire, the Dollars 46bn Chek Lap Kok airport has become an astounding reality in 1992, after 10 years on the drawing board. The tropical island site is already flattened and new contracts are being issued in abundance. As the most ambitious single infrastructural project ever undertaken in Asia, companies have arrived from all over the world to snap at airport-related contracts amounting to HKDollars 20bn in 1992 alone. These have already resulted in substantial controversy, with Hong Kong subsidiaries of UK companies receiving the bulk of the consultancy contracts for the core airport programme, to the ire of the local press. The terminal design contract also went to the most expensive bid on the short list, the British Mott Consortium, for HKDollars 536m. Further difficulties have been encountered over the principal 1,248-hectare Chek Lap Kok site preparation contract, where bids have been between 20 per cent and 50 per cent higher than the government estimate of HKDollars 10bn. Since the project uses close to 70 per cent of the available world dredging fleet, dredging prices have been raised mercilessly. Engineers claim this is a situation which should have been foreseen. The Provisional Airport Authority is having to review the contract to find ways of cutting costs. But the myriad of international construction companies touting for business in the colony seem in the main satisfied with the performance of the PAA and the government in its handling of this ambitious project. 'You have to adapt the project itself to the capacity of the industry. And on this basis, we are satisfied with the way it is being handled,' said Mr Michel Betant, managing director of Dragages et Travaux Publics (Hong Kong), which has been a large competitor in the tenders so far. Accusations of national bias have often emanated from the offices of unsuccessful bidders and the PAA is adamant it has developed a selection process as rigorous as any to be found in other such projects. The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), the body introduced in Hong Kong to battle against rampant graft in the colony, has been called in to observe the tendering process. 'It is as independent as we can get. It does not in any way favour any national interest, except to say we want people who know how to do work in Hong Kong. That is the key, along with value for money,' said Mr Richard Allen, chief executive of the PAA. The airport is designed to cater for Hong Kong's transportation needs beyond 2040. Mr Allen argues: 'There is nothing new about this project, except for the size and duration. It is bigger and has to be built in a shorter time.' Phase one of the project, aimed to be completed shortly before the handover to China on July 1, 1997, will create capacity for 35m passengers a year. Phase II, to be finished in 2040, will be able to accommodate 87m annual passengers at 120 aircraft gates. This compares with the capacity of the existing airport at Kai Tak of 24m passengers, which is expected to be reached by 1993. Linked to the Airport Core Programme are some large infrastructural projects. These include the 1.3km Tsing Ma bridge, linking Northern Lantau Island with the Mainland, the high-speed rail link which should traverse the 32km distance to Central Hong Kong in close to 20 minutes, and a highway running along the sparsely populated North Lantau coast line. The total cost of these is estimated at HKDollars 112bn, compared with the original estimates of HKDollars 99bn. The PAA is solely responsible for the activities on the airport island, but much local attention has been focused on the contract for the 'Gateway to China' Tsing Ma bridge. The key competitors for this contract are Hyundai Engineering and Construction of Korea and a consortium led by Trafalgar House of the UK. The Korean bid was in the region of HKDollars 2bn lower, but the company claims to have been unfairly picked on to provide special guarantees which have not been demanded from the other consortia. The bridge is one of the most crucial contracts for the project and the government has made it clear that it is not prepared to risk taking on a contractor which may not be able to complete on time. The government is faced with a difficult decision, but there are signs that it is planning to guillotine the Hyundai bid due to financial risk, when it announces the contract award in mid-May. This could create a political uproar. The appointment of the Trafalgar House consortium will also provide ammunition for those arguing that the airport is a last-ditch effort by the British government to cash in on its colony and support its ailing construction sector. One displeased body could be the Chinese government itself. China Road and Bridge is Hyundai's only partner in the project. Beijing may be keen to exploit politically any indications of mis-handling by the Hong Kong government. But given the depth of financial difficulties in which Hyundai finds itself, following its chairman's move into opposition politics in South Korea, the government will not be short of counter-arguments. Trafalgar House has one significant advantage, but this was the result of the government design. The bridge is to use parallel wire cable, for which only Japan has the technology. It has become apparent the technology will be readily available only to consortia with a Japanese element, which excludes Hyundai. Critics cite this as another error of judgment by the government. Consortia have suggested an alternative construction method to get round this. The bridge is just one important aspect of the project which will be resolved in the next few months. The PAA will have to progress with the financing of its part of the project. It is to raise HKDollars 20bn, although with a guaranteed income stream (it will receive income from Kai Tak from a fixed date in 1997, to cover for any potential delays with the replacement) this is not expected to cause difficulties. The Mass Transit Railway Corporation will also shortly issue consultancy contracts for its airport rail link.</p>

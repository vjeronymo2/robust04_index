Defense Minister Volker Ruehe  and his Slovak counterpart, Imrich Andrejcak, signed an  agreement to that effect in the Slovak capital, Bratislava, on  Tuesday afternoon [8 February].    After signing the agreement, Ruehe, who is spending a  two-day  visit in Slovakia, said that 20 Slovak officers are expected to  attend a short course at the Koblenz Center for Internal  Leadership at the end of February. He said he is pleased that  Slovakia wants to contribute to Europe under the NATO  Partnership for Peace program. This will bring about stability  both for Slovakia and Europe.    President Michal Kovac and Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar  assured Ruehe that their country is "very interested in becoming  a member of NATO." This coming Wednesday, Slovakia will sign  the Partnership for Peace Agreement in Brussels. Andrejcak said  that Bundeswehr officers will help his country's Army to  establish a rapid strike force.    The German-Slovak cooperation will include a regular  exchange  of information on all issues of security policy and on the use  of armed forces in disaster relief missions and humanitarian aid  missions. The contacts between individual parts of the two  forces are to be deepened, and officers shall be given the  opportunity to take part in military training courses in the  host country.    The Bundeswehr and the Slovak Army are also planning to  cooperate in matters of planning, arms control, and internal  leadership, as well as military medicine. They also intend to  cooperate in the fields of sports, military bands, and  reservists. On Wednesday, Ruehe will watch an exercise of  armored units of the Slovak Army.</p>

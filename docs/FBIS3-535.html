			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Possible Clinton Whitwatergate Cover-Up? -- Johannesburg THE  STAR in English on 9 March in a page-14 editorial says "the  virtues of Bill Clinton were being sung not long ago," but, "as  so often in the past, America's heroes are shown up to have feet  of clay." "There can be no doubt that what is called  Whitewatergate is becoming unsavoury, but whether it's another  Watergate -- the cover-up that brought down President Nixon in  1973 -- only time will tell." President Clinton has assured  Americans that his wife's "'moral compass is as strong as  anybody's in the country'" but "clouding matters is a series of  secret meetings on Whitewatergate between Treasury and White  House staffers. Clinton had better hope that he will not be  caught out on his 'no cover-up' promise."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Bophuthatswana `Fiefdom is Crumbling' -- "Only last month,  the Bophuthatswana president was offered an opportunity by  Nelson Mandela to surrender with dignity the sham independence  his territory has enjoyed since 1977," notes a page-10 editorial  in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 9 March. Now  President Mangope's "fiefdom is crumbling." "The only question  is whether he will allow it to do so without bloodshed."  "Mangope will probably not even listen to his old friend and  ally [Foreign Minister] Pik Botha, who put on his usual  performance of sweet reasonableness when he urged Mangope to  face reality. Botha is now at pains to `forget' that it was he  who ensured that troops were sent in four years ago to prop up  Mangope when he was last threatened by internal resistance.  With only 50 days left in office, Botha has neither the will  nor the resources to repeat his mistake."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   `Dilly-Dallying' Over Election Participation -- Johannesburg  SOWETAN in English on 9 March in a page-8 editorial says  "rightwing groups are still dilly-dallying" about participation  in the election, in Bophuthatswana "things are rapidly falling  apart," while the National Party and the government "are  lukewarm about international mediation to break the negotiations  logjam." It is now time to "recognise the force represented by  the vast majority of South Africa's people, who want to proceed  with the poll from 26-28 April. Parties, groups and has-been  bantustan politicians deliberately clouding the issues and  placing stumbling blocks are toying with this force at their own  peril."</p>

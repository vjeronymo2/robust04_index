			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bela Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian </F> Christian Democratic Movement, Miklos Duray, chairman of the  Coexistence Movement, and Laszlo Nagy, chairman of the Hungarian  Civic Party, by Ondrej Dostal; place and date not given:  "Positive First Steps"]    [Text] The Hungarian parties are sometimes referred to as  holding the balance of power because the present government  coalition depends on their votes in parliament. We spoke with  the chairmen of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement  [MKDH], the Coexistence Movement, and the Hungarian Civic Party  [MOS] about the new government and the present state and future  of Slovak-Hungarian relations.    [Dostal] Could you compare the previous and present Slovak  Governments?    [Bugar] For a year and a half, we were searching for  consensus and possible dialogue with Meciar's government. No  dialogue took place and a tone of confrontation prevailed. Now  we can participate in coalition talks, and one takes an interest  in our views. In May 1993, we had a meeting with the Movement  for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. One of the results was the  agreement that laws concerning minorities would be deliberated  with us before they get into the National Council of the Slovak  Republic [NRSR]. Unfortunately, this did not happen. We have  now received the promise that not only laws concerning  minorities but also all laws will be discussed at meetings of  the Coalition Council, and it seems that this promise is being  kept. I believe that it is necessary to show the Slovak public  that it is possible to govern by other than confrontational  means, as was typical of Meciar's government. The endeavor on  the part of the new government is a sincere one.    [Duray] The present government differs in a very fundamental  way from its predecessor. First and foremost, it is not  confrontational and overpoliticized and is more accommodating  toward various components of society and more acceptable to  foreign partners.    [Nagy] In one respect, the new government differs from its  predecessor in a fundamental way: It sends out very clear and  unambiguous signals about its political orientation. So far, it  has not left the domestic and foreign public in any doubt that  it is oriented toward the Western type of democracy, the market  mechanism, and the NATO security system, and that it wants to  have normal relations with its neighbors, be it the Czech  Republic, Hungary, or the other neighbors.    [Dostal] How will the activity of the new government make  itself felt in Slovak-Hungarian relations, in your opinion?    [Bugar] My first experience as regards statements by members  of the new government is very good. The government is looking  for possibilities of coming to an agreement with the Hungarian  side in some way. I think that the change of the  confrontational tone can have a positive effect. A braking  factor is that soon there will be elections in Hungary, and it  is highly unlikely that some specific steps concerning, for  example, bilateral agreements will be taken by then. It is  possible to at least agree on certain principles concerning  mutual cooperation. On both sides, one can feel the realization  that the confrontational tone that existed between Hungarian and  Slovak political representatives at the government level needs  to be changed.    [Duray] The first statements by the prime minister and  individual government members are incomparably friendlier toward  Hungary and the Hungarians living in Slovakia than statements by  the previous government. There have already been positive  echoes to this from the Hungarian side. It is questionable  whether this government will have the time to bring about some  specific changes in relations between Hungary and Slovakia but,  judging from the first statements, there exists the possibility  of an atmosphere being created between the Governments of  Hungary and Slovakia that will reinforce trust.    [Nagy] Positively. The first speech by the prime minister in  parliament testifies to his accommodating steps. The government  evidently realizes the importance and significance of  Slovak-Hungarian relations and wants to take steps to meet the  other side halfway. The response from the Hungarian side has  been positive, according to my information. It would be good to  seal the bilaterally accommodating attitude by a meeting at the  highest level still in this period [prior to elections in  Hungary and Slovakia]. This good atmosphere and the warming up  in mutual relations have been contributed to also by the will of  the new Slovak Government to tackle some problems of the  Hungarian minority in Slovakia.    [Dostal] Will the new situation have any impact on the  assertion of demands that were adopted at the assembly [of  representatives of the Hungarian minority] in Komarno [on 8  January]?    [Bugar] These demands are of a long-term nature. Everyone  who knows what they contain realizes that this cannot be  accomplished within six months and not even in one year. There  exist various areas in which certain steps could be taken. But  I would not insist that the Komarno documents be incorporated  into the government's program, as it were. They do not even  figure among the demands of the Hungarian parties because we,  too, realize that this cannot be accomplished in six months.    [Duray] The shortness of this government's term of office  does not make it possible to take any major steps, in my  opinion. It will not be possible, for example, to pass a  constitutional law on the status of minorities in Slovakia, but  some partial steps can be taken. And these are already being  taken. We assume, for example, that a law on birth registers  and a law on the bilingual names of communities will be passed  before the summer, that structural changes will be made at the  Ministry of Education, and that the concept and the composition  of the Government Council for Ethnic Minorities will be changed.  It is clear already that the reorganization of the territorial  and administrative division of Slovakia planned by Meciar's  government is being halted. This was a general demand, however,  which is to the satisfaction of all self-administrative bodies  in Slovakia.    [Nagy] I believe that the government will fulfill the  agreements that have been reached between the political parties  represented in government and the Hungarian parliamentary  parties. An agreement has been reached on Council of Europe  recommendations as well as on some personnel issues. I do not  think that the Komarno documents were used as a basis for the  agreements between the government and the Hungarian parties.    [Dostal] Do you not expect an aggravation of  Slovak-Hungarian relations in the course of the election  campaign?    [Bugar] At the moment, I can only rely on the specific steps  of this government. I assume that also other steps will help  eliminate existing mistrust on both sides. It is very important  for us that this government and the political parties that make  it up be given a chance also after the elections. Both the  government parties and the Hungarian parties are interested in  searching for possible rapprochement, and the election campaign  could be different from that of 1992, in that respect. In view  of our experience with the HZDS and the Slovak National Party  [SNS], it is to be expected that they will exploit the issue of  ethnic minorities in their election campaign. They will be  taking advantage of every step of this government, but also of  our steps, in order to demonstrate who is "the savior of this  nation" and who "protects the Slovak nation against Hungarians."    [Duray] They could come to a head. The question, first and  foremost, is how long the new government will need parliamentary  support. We expect the political tranquility we have in  Slovakia right now to end with the start of the election  campaign, at the latest. The aggravation of political  atmosphere in the national sense will depend also on the other  Slovak parties, particularly those that were represented in the  previous government because it was mainly these parties that had  introduced the tone of confrontation into Slovak politics.    [Nagy] I expect the HZDS and the SNS to intensify  Slovak-Hungarian tension and to play the so-called Hungarian  card, as they have done heretofore. They have no other option  if they want to win a certain part of voters to their side.  They will create a picture of the enemy with regard to  Hungarians and the Czechs. I would be surprised if they did  not. But I hope the population of the Slovak Republic will not  swallow for the second time the bait of the empty promises of  this movement, as it did in 1992.</p>

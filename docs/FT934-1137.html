			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Time to come clean on pension commitments Sir, I am sorry to see Samuel Brittan slip from his normal level of objectivity in arguing ('The harmful myth of hidden state debt', December 13) that unfunded public sector pension liabilities are not comparable to other national debt. He states that future pensions are 'like any other form of rising public expenditure' to be met from future tax revenue or its equivalent. While this is correct - as it is for servicing conventional debts (gilts), which have no liability other than future servicing and amortisation - the whole point in capitalisation is to express accrued 'commitments'. Indeed, unfunded pension liabilities could easily be switched into the conventional gilt sector by a scrip issue of gilts, the servicing of which (including maturities) matches pension outgo. Of course the procedure should be applied only in respect of accrued liabilities, that is those deemed to remain if workers downed tools (and thus destroyed the future tax base). In denying such an identity Mr Brittan must surely be arguing that future pension payments, unlike gilt-edged debt, are not genuine commitments. On past form, he is probably right, but if so let's come clean] Mr Brittan gives himself away in concluding that disclosures of higher debt will promote tax increases which will 'delay recovery still further'. Not every economist believes this argument, but for those who do believe it, is it a justification for deceit?

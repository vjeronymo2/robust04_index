			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Untitled comments by Yegor Gaydar of "Russia's Choice" and </F> Sergey Khramov of Association of Socialist Trade Unions under  "Opinions" rubric]    [Text] Yegor Gaydar:    We certainly favor accord if it really is a question of  civil  accord. In this we do, of course, support the idea voiced by  the president [of a memorandum on civil peace and accord]. The  crux of the matter, in my view, consists in just one thing. If  the memorandum is adopted in order to comply with it, if forces  prepared to sign it agree to assume responsibility for the  political conduct of their supporters, for their compliance with  order, and for their rejection of propaganda of violence, of  course we are in favor, but if this is another fig leaf designed  to cover up activity aimed at destabilizing the situation in  Russia, fanning social strife, and provoking public disorders  and to cover up the increasing pressure on the authorities and  the increasing discrediting of the institutions of Russian  statehood, we will not participate in such a sly game.    Sergey Khramov:    The idea of social peace is a very good idea, particularly  as  the trade unions cannot work under other conditions, and they  more than anyone need stability and peace. But any agreement  presupposes obligations: Who gives what and who receives what,  otherwise the contract will not work. Unfortunately, we now  place very great emphasis on the purely political aspects, and  the economy is regarded only as one aspect of politics.  Meanwhile, labor relations should not be underestimated as a  very influential factor in politics. But it now turns out that  we are introducing market relations into production, while  manpower is being sold and bought according to the old,  nonmarket rules. This is why there is such a large gap between  wages and prices and why there is social tension. The free  trade unions would like to introduce market relations also into  the sphere of labor relations. In our view, the memorandum must  indicate specific obligations and specify liability for  violations of them. We are prepared to sign such an agreement.  In addition, we will uphold the trade unions' right to strike,  only not as a weapon to pressure the authorities and the  government, but as a working instrument for resolving  disagreements between hired workers and employers.</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / IBM sent back by appeals court to face retrial in anti-trust suit A federal appeals court has sent IBM back for a retrial on a nine-year-old anti-trust suit, in a ruling that could affect the computer group's efforts to escape from the legal restrictions imposed on it under the Eisenhower administration. The appeals court in Philadelphia unanimously overturned a judgment in IBM's favour in a case brought by Allen-Myland, a company specialising in overhauling and upgrading IBM mainframe computers. Allen-Myland claimed IBM abused its dominant position in the market by manipulating the price of parts for mainframe computers, so it had in effect illegally tied customers into using its own upgrading services and excluded Allen-Myland from the market. The upgrade market was a substantial one, sometimes as large as sales of new mainframes, and Allen-Myland at one point accounted for as much as half the upgrades. But when IBM introduced its 308X generation of mainframes in 1980, it used a 'net pricing policy' in which the cost of installation by IBM was bundled in with the price of upgrade parts, so discouraging customers from using any other installer. In addition, IBM required customers to return used parts to them, thus drying up a potential alternative source of parts. The district court had rejected Allen-Myland's charge, on the basis that IBM's share of the market was not large enough to give it 'market power'. But the appeals court said there was an 'analytical flaw' in the lower court's determination of the relevant market, and had double-counted some possible sources of competition. In particular, it said the lower court was wrong to include computer leasing companies as alternative suppliers in calculating the market. Mr Robert Levy, a lawyer with Sutherland, Asbill &amp; Brennan who represents Allen-Myland, said the distinction was critical in the mainframe market, because leasing companies accounted in the early 1980s, in the period the case deals with, for a large share of the market. Although the appeals court leaves to the lower court the detailed decision, it orders it to recalculate the size of the market excluding most leasing companies. The ruling on the definition of the relevant market could have widespread ramifications for IBM's efforts to get rid of a 1956 consent decree it negotiated with the Justice Department under President Dwight Eisenhower. In June, IBM asked a federal judge to lift the decree, which was imposed when computers still used vacuum tubes and dominance of the data-processing market was very clear. The decree requires IBM to offer its computers for outright sale - where before it had only leased them - and requires it to operate its computer service business separately from its manufacturing business. Although IBM is clearly no longer dominant in the broadest definition of the computer market, the issue of whether it still dominates the mainframe market could depend on precise definition of the market.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Mr Gonzalez talks tough MR FELIPE Gonzalez appears to have changed tack. After weeks of fruitless negotiations with Spain's trade unions over proposed budget cuts, labour market reforms and wage ceilings, the Spanish prime minister declared this week that his minority government would try to impose the changes anyway. But whether Mr Gonzalez can fulfil this threat, and make his reforms stick, is quite another matter. Tough words and confrontational actions may cheer the financial markets, but they will not necessarily deliver the fall in wage inflation upon which sustained recovery depends. Mr Gonzalez has reason to feel frustrated. The collapse of the hard exchange rate mechanism, the focus of his economic policy, has exposed the seriously depressed and distorted state of Spain's economy. But it has not yet prompted Spain's labour leaders to agree to the kind of reforms in the country's anachronistic and inflexible labour market upon which growth depends. Wage inflation is the immediate problem. Despite Spain's persisting recession and an unemployment rate of 22 per cent, core price inflation is stuck at 5.5 per cent while wage inflation remains above 7 per cent. Slow growth and rising spending on public sector wages and benefits mean that the budget deficit will grow to 6.2 per cent of gross domestic product product this year, once again outstripping last year's over-optimistic target. Meanwhile, these persistent wage pressures continue to persuade the Bank of Spain that keeping short-term interest rates in double figures is necessary, despite the devalued peseta's new-found stability. This is crushing domestic demand and adding to the government's budgetary woes. At the root of the problem lies the restrictive nature of Spanish labour market regulations. There may be a happy medium between over-regulated continental Europe and America's hire-and-fire culture, but Spain is very much at the regulated extreme. Its notice and severance pay requirements are restrictive even by European standards. The result, in addition to persistent wage pressure, has been a rise in the percentage of Spanish workers in unprotected temporary jobs, from 14.2 per cent in 1987 to 31.1 per cent in 1991, over twice as high as in any other OECD country. At last, Spain has a government which appears willing to address these deficiencies. Last week, finance minister Pedro Solbes announced a plausibly tough budget, which projected a deficit of 5.7 per cent of GDP next year by assuming that the government could impose a civil service pay freeze and limiting next year's pension increases. Meanwhile, Mr Gonzalez says he will unilaterally push through a liberalisation of the hire-and-fire rules and a shift towards plant level bargaining. But Mr Gonzalez is playing a risky game. While looser labour laws are a necessary condition for renewed employment growth, the key to his budget and employment hopes is economic recovery. This means lower interest rates soon which, in turn, require a rapid moderation in wage inflation. But the British evidence does not suggest that either deregulation or a shift to plant-level bargaining will deliver lower wage inflation, certainly not when the reforms are first introduced. Back in August, Mr Gonzalez was right to seek to negotiate a wage pact to cap average private and public sector wage inflation over the next three years. The wage pact remains the key to rapid interest rate cuts. It is too early to give up the search for consensus.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- A senior official of Japan's  ruling coalition proposed Tuesday [5 April] holding summit talks  in Beijing between U.S. President Bill Clinton and North Korean  leader Kim Il-song to settle an international dispute over  Pyongyang's suspected nuclear development program.    Issei Inoue, vice chairman of the Social Democratic Party  (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ], the largest among the seven ruling  parties, also proposed sending a group of coalition Diet members  to North and South Korea, China and the United States to seek  support for the U.S.-North Korean summit. Inoue, who visited  China between Friday and Sunday as head of an SDP delegation,  put forth those proposals during a meeting with Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata, officials said.    Hata offered support for an idea of creating opportunities  for North Korea to have dialogue through exchanges with Japanese  Diet members. But the foreign minister was quoted as saying,  "We should consider (sending Diet members) not only as the SDP  but the coalition parties as a whole."</p>

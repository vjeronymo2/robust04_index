			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE PASSES TEXTILE QUOTA BILL, BUT VETO LOOMS;  </P> <P> APPAREL: THE ADMINISTRATION OPPOSES THE LEGISLATION AS A THREAT TO  TRADE-LIBERALIZATION TALKS IN GENEVA.  </P> <P> The House approved legislation Tuesday to protect the U.S. textile industry,  but in a victory for the Bush Administration, the vote fell short of the  two-thirds majority needed to override a presidential veto.  </P> <P> The bill, passed overwhelmingly in the Senate before the House backed it 271 to  149, would impose stiff quotas on imports of textiles, clothing and shoes,  effectively raising the price of such goods to limit job losses in domestic  industries.  </P> <P> Ardent supporters of the legislation -- mostly from the South, where the bulk  of the U.S. textile industry is based -- contend that it is needed to keep 2  million mostly low-paid jobs from falling victim to foreign goods.  </P> <P> "A number of these plants are in smaller towns, and when their factories shut  down there is no work elsewhere," said Rep. James Quillen (R-Tenn.). "A  philosophical discussion of free trade is all well and good, but it does not  pay the rent or put food on the table."  </P> <P> The White House, which has said that President Bush will veto the bill, opposes  the legislation as a threat to the global trade-liberalization talks under way  in Geneva. It has warned that, if the bill becomes law, it would usher in a  dangerous era of trade wars.  </P> <P> "It would send the wrong message to retreat now from the world economy and  build protectionist walls just when the reform governments of Eastern Europe,  Latin America and Asia need our leadership in forging a more open international  economy," Bush wrote Monday in a letter to House leaders.  </P> <P> Lawmakers opposing the bill argued that textiles and apparel are already among  the most sheltered U.S. industries and do not need additional protection.  </P> <P> "These industries are just going through the same ups and downs every other  American business experiences," said Rep. Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.). "Moving a plant  so it is closer to the interstate (highway) has had far more impact on people  in my part of the country than all the foreign competition put together."  </P> <P> Among those opposing the bill are many U.S. apparel firms that rely on overseas  suppliers. For example, Los Angeles-based Carole Little, a women's sportswear  and dress designer, makes about half its merchandise overseas and often buys  foreign textiles for the goods it produces domestically.  </P> <P> "We don't like to see the government interfere in these issues," said Leonard  Rabinowitz, the firm's chairman. "We don't think it helps."  </P> <P> Up until the last moment, the bill's opponents feared that they would not get  the 145 votes needed to sustain a veto. Roughly 15 more Republicans than  expected supported the White House after the Administration launched a belated  lobbying campaign to limit support.  </P> <P> Congressional strategists say the bill appears doomed for the year.  </P> <P> The fight over textile quotas is a recurring one on Capitol Hill, where two  similar bills have been approved in the past five years -- only to be vetoed.  </P> <P> This year the battle was more intense because textile forces -- joined by shoe  manufacturers, sugar and cotton growers, shipbuilders and steelmakers -- are  fearful that the Bush Administration plans to reduce their long-protected  position in the U.S. economy.  </P> <P> To win concessions from poorer countries to help U.S. industries expand abroad,  the White House hopes to phase out the worldwide system of quotas that holds  back textile and apparel exports from many Third World nations.  </P> <P> Backers of Tuesday's legislation, although acknowledging their disappointment  over the vote, said the strong support for the textile bill should send a  signal to the Administration not to sell out the industry's interests in the  Uruguay Round of trade talks scheduled to be completed this December.  </P> <P> "The White House better go very, very easy," argued Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-Ga.).  "If they phase out textile quotas, they're going to have a hard time getting  the implementing legislation out of here."  </P> <P> Administration officials believe, however, that the textile industry's third  failure in a row to mount enough support to force the bill into law should give  the White House added clout with other nations as the trade talks go down to  the wire.  </P> <P> "It is crucial to the health of the world trading system that this bill be  killed," said William Cline, an analyst at the Institute for International  Economics in Washington.  </P> <P> "Otherwise," Cline added -- in a reference to a highly protectionist 1930s law  that helped make the Great Depression far worse -- "it could turn out to be the  Smoot-Hawley of the 1990s."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Stuart Silverstein contributed to this report.  </P></p>

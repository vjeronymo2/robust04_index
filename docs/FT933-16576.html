			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: Japanese film group seeks protection NIKKATSU, a Japanese film producer and distributor listed on the main section of the Tokyo stock exchange, yesterday filed for court protection with debts totalling Y49.7bn (Dollars 464.5m). It is the first time in eight years that a company listed on the TSE first section has filed for court protection under the corporate rehabilitation law. Nikkatsu, which had diversified into the real estate and golf membership businesses in the late 1980s, said it had been hit by the sharp fall in golf membership prices and interest payment burdens stemming from its real estate business. Japanese film producers have been facing hard times due to the lack of hits and waning interest among consumers for Japanese films. The downturn of the industry forced most companies to diversify into areas such as real estate and development of old film theatres. Nikkatsu turned itself into a film producer in the 1970s, later moving into property, golf resorts, and video game arcade businesses in the 1980s, while returning to films for the general audience. Unlike other Japanese leading film-makers and distributing companies, Nikkatsu lacks the ties with large keiretsu or corporate groupings. Teikoku Data Bank, a private credit research company, said Nikkatsu lost control over its book keeping after the rapid diversification into various businesses. Nikkatsu's investments in its video software business also became a burden, while the company also faced large losses from its film Rakuyo distributed last summer which was a major box-office failure. For the year to last January, Nikkatsu posted an after-tax loss of Y6.9bn on sales of Y10.5bn. According to Teikoku, leading lenders to Nikkatsu, which are likely to help in future restructuring, include Sanwa Bank, Fuji Bank, Asahi Bank and Kofuku Bank. The TSE yesterday suspended trading in Nikkatsu after reports that the company had dishonoured bills.</p>

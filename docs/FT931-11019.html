			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices rise Oil prices rose by 25 cents in late trading to reach Dollars 18.60 a barrel for North Sea Brent crude, writes Deborah Hargreaves. The price rise followed comments by current president of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Mr Alirio Parra, that all 12 Opec countries had agreed to play their part in cutting the cartel's output by 1m barrels a day. Mr Parra was quoted by the official Opec news agency as saying the market had already taken account of an Opec accord to cut production to 23.5m b/d. The International Energy Agency, the west's oil monitoring body, showed in its monthly oil report yesterday that Opec production had been 25m b/d in January. It estimated that world oil demand would rise by 1.5 per cent in the first quarter of the year to 39.9m b/d.</p>

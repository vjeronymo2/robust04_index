			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Shareholders snub Wiltshire Brewery offer The Investment Bank of Ireland has ended up with 19.4 per cent of the Wiltshire Brewery Company after a low subscription by shareholders in the restructuring of the group that will leave the Indian UB Group in management control. Shareholders took up only 4.14 per cent of shares which were subject to a placing under the restructuring, and 5.73 per cent of the shares available under open offer. The balance of 54.6m shares will be subscribed by conditional placees, leaving the Investment Bank with its 19 per cent stake. Wiltshire's advisers expect this to be placed in the next few months. The deal will allow UB Group, headed by Mr Vijay Mallya and his family, to take a 15.5 per cent stake and management control if the deal is approved by an extraordinary meeting of Wiltshire shareholders tomorrow.</p>

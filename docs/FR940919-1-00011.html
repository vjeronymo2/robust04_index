This proposal would require inspection of a kingpin riser on the lower surface of the outer wing to determine fastener placement. The proposed AD also would require repetitive inspections for fatigue cracks in the kingpin riser if the fasteners are positioned outside certain limits, and repair, if necessary. This proposal is prompted by reports of insufficient distance between the center of the outermost fastener on the kingpin riser and the edge of the riser, which can adversely affect the fatigue resistance of the outer wing assembly. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent structural failure of the lower surface of the outer wing due to fatigue cracks in the kingpin riser.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by November 10, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;88&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

Insufficient distance between the fastener and the riser edge adversely affects the fatigue resistance of the outer wing assembly due to fatigue cracks in the kingpin riser. Such fatigue cracking, if not corrected, could result in structural failure of the lower surface of the outer wing assembly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The FAA has reviewed and approved Hercules Service Bulletin 382&hyph;57&hyph;74 (82&hyph;688), dated January 31, 1994, which describes procedures for an ultrasonic inspection of kingpin riser number 18 on the lower surface of the outer wing to determine the distance between the center of the outermost fastener on the kingpin riser and the edge of the riser. In addition, for fasteners positioned outside certain limits described in the service bulletin, the service bulletin describes repetitive ultrasonic inspections to detect cracks in the kingpin riser, and repair, if necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require an inspection of a kingpin riser on the lower surface of the outer wing to determine fastener placement; and repetitive inspections for fatigue cracks in the kingpin riser if the fasteners are positioned outside certain limits, and repair, if necessary. The inspections would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. The repair would be required to be accomplished in accordance with a method approved by the FAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> There are approximately 20 Lockheed Model 382 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 20 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 4 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $4,400, or $220 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES.  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

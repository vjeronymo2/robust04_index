			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 13 (XINHUA) -- Senior opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) member Michio Watanabe has given  up his plan to run for the office of prime minister that  Morihiro Hosokawa suddenly quit last Friday [8 April], the NIHON  KEIZAI SHIMBUN reported today.    Watanabe, a former deputy prime minister and former foreign  minister, hit a snag as he apparently failed to garner enough  supporters within the LDP for his bid to run for the top  government post, the leading business daily said.    Two major forces in the ruling alliance -- Shinseito (Japan  Renewal Party) and Komeito (Clean Government) -- had been  backing Watanabe as a replacement for Hosokawa under the  assumption that the Social Democratic Party, the largest  contingent in the coalition, and the new party Sakigake  (Harbinger) be ousted from the coalition and Watanabe and his  followers join the coalition.    However, Shinseito and Komeito seemed to have reached the  conclusion that they could hardly push ahead with their Watanabe  campaign in view of the slim possibility of his bolting from the  LDP with his followers to team up with them, news reports said,  quoting sources close to the two parties.</p>

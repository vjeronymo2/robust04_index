			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: BASF/Boots Boots' reasons for selling its prescription drugs business are easier to fathom than BASF's motives for buying it. Boots' operations lacked critical mass in research and development. Discovering and bringing a new medicine to market is risky. The best way to reduce that risk is to have a broad portfolio so, if a drug is dropped because it proves unsafe or ineffective, alternatives remain. But Boots' drugs sales were insufficient to support such a large portfolio. When its heart-drug Manoplax failed, there was little to take its place. In the short-term, BASF may discover some geographic and product synergies. Overheads, marketing and R&amp;D can be rationalised. The price, at 1.6 times sales, is reasonable compared with the multiples paid for American Cyanamid and Syntex. Even so, compared with Bayer or Hoechst, BASF will remain a pharmaceutical pygmy - about 30th in world rankings. Buying Boots will promote it from the fourth to third division. If the Boots deal is the first in a series enlarging its patented drugs business, BASF's strategy may work. As Sweden's Pharmacia has demonstrated, viable drugs companies can be constructed by amalgamating third division players. Innovative products could be secured by taking a stake in a US biotechnology group. Though BASF's strategy may pay off, it is hard to believe it is the best use of the group's resources. BASF's strengths are not in marketing medicines. They are financial - its cost of capital is well below ICI's - and in technology-based heavy industry such as bulk chemicals. Galling though Hoechst's and Bayer's healthcare success may be, BASF would do better to concentrate on what it does best.</p>

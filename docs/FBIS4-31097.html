			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] At today's session of the National  Executive [Valasztmany] of Fidesz [Federation of Young  Democrats] all the important leaders of the party, including  Chairman Viktor Orban, resigned. This is how they drew the  lessons of the party's failure in the election. Correspondent  Edit Nagy interviewed Viktor Orban.    [Begin recording] [Orban] National Executive Chairman Jozsef  Szajer has resigned and so have I, from my post as party  chairman. In effect, all the party officeholders have done the  same -- including the deputy chairmen of the party.    [Nagy] Why did you make this decision?    [Orban] The party performed poorly at the elections--in  terms  of our expectations--and the responsibility for this must be  borne by the party's highest-level elected officeholders,  especially the chairman.    [Nagy] The congress will decide whether to accept the  resignations. What do you expect?    [Orban] Until the next congress everybody will remain in  place, in practice they will carry out their duties on a  provisional acting basis, at least this is what I think.  Tomorrow only the date for convening the congress will be  debated, presumably sometime in June when--if the party thinks  fit--it will be able to elect its new leaders.</p>

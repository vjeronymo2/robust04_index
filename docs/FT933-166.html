			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Single market, phase two THE SINGLE market's launch on January 1 stands out as the European Community's main success in recent years, contrasting sharply with the trials over monetary union. The programme to remove barriers to goods, services and capital has already knitted together the economies of the 12. In time, it should lead to higher growth rates and enhanced competitiveness. The Commission is now seeking to maintain the momentum, and earlier this week presented a draft 'strategic programme' to the Council of Ministers, setting out three broad areas for future action. First, better implementation of the original programme. Only half the single market directives have been implemented by all 12 countries. The Commission's main concerns are that people still face frontier controls, and governments have been slow to open up public procurement, which accounts for 15 per cent of EC economic activity. Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archifari, internal market commissioner, is pursuing countries which fail to enforce directives through the European Court of Justice. Second, filling in the gaps of the original programme. The biggest item in this category is direct taxation. The Commission argues that different corporation tax regimes, in particular, distort decisions over business location and co-ordination is therefore needed. Frontier bottlenecks Third, trans-European networks. Here the Commission's concern is that transport, energy and telecommunications networks are planned at national levels to serve national needs with the result that there are bottlenecks at frontiers. It wants national operators to overcome the problems of poor cross-border linkages by co-ordinating investment. While the Commission's general idea of a new single market drive is good, its detailed proposals are mixed. Most welcome is the crackdown on governments which do not enforce directives. It is unfair for countries to enjoy access to markets in other states, while keeping their own markets closed. Less satisfactory is the emphasis on tax 'co-ordination', which seems to be a new way of saying harmonisation. It is not simply that there is little hope of persuading national governments to relinquish control over what they rightly regard as a core responsibility. Co-ordination could even undermine competitive forces in the single market. In so far as businesses are prepared to move location to take advantage of lower taxes, individual governments are given a competitive spur to keep their tax rates down. Greatest profits Instead of frittering away its energies on tax, the Commission should focus on liberalising sectors left out of the original single market programme. The priority should be to free up markets in energy, telecoms and postal services, which in most countries are state-owned monopolies. It is no coincidence that there is a close correspondence between these sectors and those where networks are fragmented on national lines. National monopolies invest within their frontiers, while fighting tooth and nail to keep rivals out of their territories. Competitive private enterprise, by contrast, would have an incentive to focus investment on bottlenecks because that is where the greatest profits will be made. Unfortunately, the Commission has not made the link between fragmented networks and monopolies. As a result, its main emphasis is on co-ordinating monopolies rather than abolishing them. While the Commission has made tentative moves towards liberalisation, there is no sense of urgency. Even in telecommunications, where progress is greatest, monopolies will remain at least until 1998. In energy and postal services, liberalisation appears to have ground to a halt. Vested interests are so powerful that it will not be easy force open monopolies. Attempts to press on with liberalisation will be countered by arguments that competition could lead to job losses. But the Commission should remember that inefficient monopolies impose costs on all other sectors of the economy, hampering their ability to compete in world markets and create new jobs. An assault on monopolies should therefore be the prime thrust in the next phase of its single market programme.</p>

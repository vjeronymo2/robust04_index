			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Arts: All hokum and holiness - Cinema THE BAD LIEUTENANT (18) Abel Ferrara A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT (PG) Robert Redford THE LAST DAYS OF CHEZ NOUS (15) Gillian Armstrong MEAN STREETS (18) Martin Scorsese 'No one can kill me. I'm blessed. I'm a Catholic,' says detective Harvey Keitel in Abel Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant. In Sleeper Woody Allen, masquerading as a surgeon in the year two-thousand-and-something, was called on to reconstruct a human being from a single disembodied nose. Many of us could imaginatively reconstruct the rest of Ferrara's film from that single line of dialogue. This is the one about the bad, possibly mad, certainly dangerous cop. Harvey Keitel's lieutenant, a corruption-prone veteran of the New York Police, is so bent that you could use him to arrest people around corners. His specialities are violent crime, drugs and sexual offences. In order to stop himself enjoying all three, he must keep invoking his Catholic beliefs. Assailed by bleeding visions of Christ, he knows that redemption is possible if he can only get his moral act together. Violence is 'in' today. See Reservoir Dogs, Man Bites Dog and other films with or without canine titles. So the small handful of once-panned movies in writer-director Ferrara's filmography, from Driller Killer to King Of New York, have lately been undergoing revision as masterworks of gutter realism. Result: the flattered Ferrara catches the biggest dose of pretension since De Palma made The Bonfire Of The Vanities. After the cynical, crackling promise of early scenes - Keitel snaffling drugs from crime-scene cars, Keitel pocketing a convenience-store robber's loot, Keitel forcing a 'freebie' from two ladies of the night - God gets his call to the set. The violent rape of a nun on a church altar by two hoodlums - no sensationalist possibility omitted there, I think - first gets our hero thinking about redemption. Putting his knitted brows and musclebound stoop into action, Keitel keeps shambling back to the church where the crime was committed. Here he first sees a vision of Jesus complete with bleeding head and nimbus of light. Then he re-encounters the abused nun, Sister Plot Device, who counsels him to forgive rather than to avenge. If you imagine Mickey Spillane adapting Graham Greene's The Power And The Glory for Michael Winner, you might have an idea of the battle raging here between holiness and hokum. All stops are out visually and viscerally. But one finally concludes that the reason Ferrara rubs our noses in depravity - real needles entering real arms, realistic blood showering real walls or windows - is that if he allowed us once to stand back and see the panoramic for the particular we might rumble the movie's idiot self-importance. Idea for thesis: artist's trichological condition as trigger to his creative style. In A River Runs Through It America is seen by director Robert Redford as if through the golden cascades of his own hair. We are ushered into the story by RR's voice-over, purring gilded sentences from the homonymous boyhood memoir by Norman MacLean. Then, in the feature-length flashback that is the film, young Redford lookalike Brad Pitt takes over as one of the tale's two brothers, sparring for self-fulfilment with each other and with pastor father Tom Skerritt. Actually - just for confusion - the un-Redfordish Craig Sheffer, who resembles John Malkovich with hair, plays the putative young Redford, based on the young MacLean. Pitt is his handsome sibling Paul, hellraising in early-century Montana and making Pa Skerritt so goshdarn angry. (Watch that milk jug as you thump the table, Pop.) For while Norman is college-bound and chastely enamoured of Britain's Emily Lloyd (plus American accent), Paul is deep in whores, whisky and poker debts. We have seen this story before, have we not? About - I take a guess - 100 times. But here there is a novel metaphor. The scenes of fly-fishing in the sparkling, russet-banked rivers are given a real lyricism by Redford and his cameraman Philippe Rousselot (The Emerald Forest). Long fishing-lines arc and curl in sun-caught silver; Coplandish music by Mark Isham warbles on the soundtrack; and even the hardest heart melts a little at this shrewdly gorgeous image of an American Dream woven from man-made discipline and close-to-nature freedom. For while the scenery fills the brothers' spiritual lungs, Dad sharpens their mental mettle by teaching them the 'Presbyterian way' to cast a line. This involves metronomes and much mind-over-matter. Brief filial revolts are inevitable - like Paul taking Norm off on a rapids-shooting trip - but soon the the boys will surely thank and respect Dad and even grow up to write about him. The lectures never quite crush the life out of the lyricism. Even when wondering 'Is Norman MacLean an outdoor version of Norman Rockwell?', we glow as the images glide past in this river trip through a never-never America. And when the sun goes down each day and we traipse indoors for the movie's lecture sessions - yes, the heart and mind, animus and anima must rule equally - we know it is only until morning that director-producer Redford has pushed his hair back under his mortar-board. Idea for another thesis: The Euro-actor as today's equivalent of the Wandering Jew. Germany's Bruno Ganz seems no clearer about what he is doing in Australia in Gillian Armstrong's The Last Days Of Chez Nous than he was about being in England in David Hare's Strapless or in America in The Boys From Brazil. Let me supply the answer. He is the soul of Western art and civilisation. In Armstrong's tale of Bohemian lives among a group of Aussie fortysomethings, Ganz alternates meal-table tantrums ('For two years I have been looking for zese cheeses]' when someone takes a bite from his precious Brie) with burgeoning romantic disenchantment ('Do you think we'll ever make love again?' mourns girlfriend Lisa Harrow). He is adrift, as is the audience, in a world where the affirmative hedonism of the 1960s has turned to live-and-make-do. Gillian Armstrong made the famous, overrated My Brilliant Career. Here she goes for another pin-down-the-zeitgeist tale; but a film about formlessness is harder to do than one about formativeness. As the characters yatter around the sempiternal kitchens and Late Flower-Power sitting rooms - also present are Harrow's pubescent daughter (Miranda Otto) and pregnant half-sister (Kerry Fox) - we feel as if we are at the wrong party, pressed to the wall by yesterday's people shrilly insisting they are today's. Mean Streets, which 20 years ago marked Martin Scorsese's breakthrough as a feature film director, is yesterday's movie but still of today. Vivid, visionary, sardonic: everything that Bad Lieutenant tries to be but fails. It even has the same star, Harvey Keitel, here fresher in his mannerisms as the Mafia 'collector' who moves through the bars of Little Italy as if through the ante-chambers of Hell. Also present: Robert De Niro in his starmaking role as Keitel's victim pal, a human jack-in-the-box who jumps out through the screen the more the plot pushes him down.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Rail watchdog threatens subsidy West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority is likely to withhold Pounds 2m from Regional Railways Central - 40 per cent of the subsidy to the train operating company for running services during the quarter to June, Paul Cheeseright writes. Centro, the authority's operating arm, said that since the break-up of the industry on April 1 'only 60.5 per cent of Centro subsidised services on seven local lines ran to within three minutes of timetable'. Centro acknowledged that there were infrastructure problems but 'a significant amount of chaos has been directly attributable to staff shortages which should have been avoided.' No comment was available from Regional Railways Central.</p>

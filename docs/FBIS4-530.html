			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by P. Bulger] </F>   [Text] Pretoria April 12 SAPA -- The government was joining  the international mediation process intended to resolve the  country's constitutional deadlock, African National Congress  Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa told the Transitional  Executive Council [TEC] on Tuesday [12 April].    Mr Ramaphosa said the mediation was originally intended to  involve only the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP].  However, negotiators had decided at Friday's Skukuza summit that  the government should become a party to the mediation. The  government has, until now, been lukewarm about the mediation  process, fearing it could reopen a range of already-settled  constitutional issues.    Mr Ramaphosa, who was providing the TEC with a summary of  the  negotiations to date, said a task force met on Monday to draw up  a new proposal for consideration by Zulu King Goodwill  Zwelithini. The task force comprises representatives of the ANC,  the IFP, the South African Government and the Zulu monarchy.    Mr Ramaphosa said "considerable progress was made" by the  task force, which was due to meet again on Tuesday afternoon to  hear the response of the king and kwaZulu chief minister and IFP  leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi to the new proposal. He said the  terms of reference for the mediation process would also be  determined on Tuesday. However, he warned against IFP  expectations that the elections might be postponed.    "The IFP seems to be getting into the mediation process in  the hope that the process will result in the date of elections  being postponed. The election date is sacrosanct, not even the  mediation process can tamper with it," Mr Ramaphosa said. He  expressed disappointment about the outcome of the Skukuza summit  and the fact that it did not yield a more positive result. He  said the outcome of the task force's deliberations depended on  the king and kwaZulu's response.    Speaking on the same issue, South African Communist Party  Chairman Joe Slovo repeated that the elections would not be  postponed.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial report] At 2050 GMT on 9 January 1994 Cologne  RTL-Plus Television Network in German in its "Spiegel TV"  magazine program carries an unattributed 15-minute report on  Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy, nicknamed Adolfovich because of  his Hitlerite views.    The report begins with clips in Zhirinovskiy's 47th birthday  in Moscow recently, where he received Gerhard Frey, chairman of  the German People's Union, and Iraqi ambassador to Russia Gafil  Husayn, who wished him well. The reporter notes that  Zhirinovskiy and Iraq's Saddam Husayn are comrades because of  their "joint hatred for the Jews."    The report then flashes back to the time after the putsch  against Gorbachev. At a meeting in the Kremlin in September  1991, Zhirinovskiy is shown engaging in "political forecasts":  "There will be only one unified Russia; no autonomous  republics. The bolsheviks have experimented. This has failed.  Now come the democrats. This will fail, too. And then I will  come."    At some unidentified outdoor rally, Zhirinovskiy is seen  speaking to a crowd of people: "I reach my hands out for the  nuclear weapons. I will put an end to Russia's humiliation.  Our Army will stay there, and not one single Georgian combat  plane will ever again shoot down a Russian pilot. No gang of  Afghans will ever again violate the border again. Not one  single kilogram of Russian goods will ever again be stolen. No  one will harm even one hair on a Russian's head. Then they will  feel what Russia is. But those guys in the Kremlin are just  dragging themselves, groaning and panting, from the buffet to  the toilet. That is all that they are still able to do. When  Moldovan bandits saw a Russian to pieces with a chainsaw, I will  destroy their industry -- quite simple. And when in Kyrgyzstan  a Russian is torn apart by two horses, I will destroy the entire  region."    An unidentified officer in the crowd speaks up, holding out  his right arm in the fascist salute: "Vladimir Volfovich, we  officers support you."    There follow clips on interviews with people in the street,  who all support Zhirinovskiy: "Zhirinovskiy is great, much  better than Yeltsin. He defends Russia. He stops the sell-out  of the nation." "He speaks very well, above all soberly." "He  describes everything correctly. The nation is being oppressed,  our nation."    The reporter notes that Zhirinovskiy supported the "putsch  of  the Stalinist nomenklatura against Gorbachev." Zhirinovskiy is  shown commenting on the putsch: "There should not have made so  many telephone calls; they should simply have shot everyone  involved in the sabotage. When Russia's interior minister did  not follow orders, the officers should have liquidated him  within five minutes. Just as with Pinochet: Shoot a few  officers, and the putsch would have been successful. A few  combat helicopters should have bombed the White House to rubble,  and the entire gang should have been arrested. Everything is  rotten. All generals are senile. They are incompetent. That  is why they lost. It could have worked, and then this would  have been a different country here -- a powerful USSR."    The report then continues with film clips on Zhirinovskiy  showing his bodyguards his former headquarters in the Moscow  hotel. Explaining the uniforms his bodyguards wear, closely  modeled on German uniforms during the Third Reich, Zhirinovskiy  notes: "We have meanwhile become a powerful organization, and  the boys wanted a uniform. This commits them to our cause and  they feel like full party members."    Zhirinovskiy says that he will make sure that a memorial  plaque is mounted in the room where his party headquarters was  located during the presidential elections.    In the new party headquarters in Moscow's "Fishmonger's  Lane," guards wear "contemporary" German uniforms. The building  also houses the party's youth organization. Its head, V.  Akhimov, says: "Our party developed practically out of nothing  in very turbulent times. We have won thousands of followers  virtually overnight, just as Hitler's party did in the past.  It, too, won its followers before it came to power. The second  common point: Hitler came to power legally, through elections.  We, too. Our party is legal. Therefore, we will come to power  in line with the Constitution. Third, Hitler pursued a tough  national policy. He did a lot of good for the Germans. Today  we are pursuing the same policy, but here in our country. We  want Russians to be well off in Russia."    The reporter notes that "for this purpose, firm friendships  abroad are also needed. Russia's Hitler feels particularly  comfortable with Iraqi dictator Saddam Husayn." Zhirinovskiy is  shown pointing at a world map and saying: "Our Arab friends are  our most reliable partners. And here you see Europe. We fought  against the Finnish, the Swedish, the Poles, the Hungarians, and  the Romanians. The only really consistently reliable partner is  Germany."    Then follow film clips of a festive event organized during  Gerhard Frey's recent visit to Moscow. Toasting Zhirinovskiy,  Frey says: "We want you to become the leader of strong, large,  just, and rich Russia. Together with millions of Russians, we  see you as Russia's hope. In this spirit, I drink to our  personal friendship and to the eternal and inseparable  friendship of our peoples. Long live Vladimir Zhirinovskiy,  long live Russia."    Zhirinovskiy, for his part, says: "I would like to add that,  to implement our plans, we need German precision and the courage  of the Russian people. In the Middle Ages [as heard] in Germany  there was an attempt to establish a new order in Europe. This  did not work out. And in Moscow there was an attempt to  establish a new order at the end of the century. This did not  work, either. To German Prussia and to Russian Alaska."    The reporter then notes that, despite Zhirinovsky's heavy  drinking, he, together with a uniformed delegation, was invited  to Baghdad. "After all, Russians and Iraqis have a common  enemy," the reporter says.    In Baghdad, Zhirinovskiy is shown saying: "Everywhere there  is war, there are Americans. Wherever there are diseases, they  come from the United States --AIDS, drunkenness, moral decline  -- everything comes from the United States."    The youth organization is not so happy about this enemy  image. V. Akhimov says: "Actually, I do not want to wage war  against the United States, because both countries have the same,  threatening problems -- our government, our press, science, and  arts are very deeply permeated by Jews, and this also applies to  the United States. I do not understand that -- as if there were  no talented, intelligent, educated people among the Russians.  Of course, they exist. However, again and again, one is  confronted with the following situation: A Russian employs  everyone who can work in his company. A Jew, however, always  only takes a Jew."    Then Zhirinovskiy is shown speaking at some rally: "As a  result of World War I, the rule of the Zionists developed. They  intended to take over world leadership. However, they  miscalculated. They thought: After Lenin comes Trotsky -- and  he agreed to it, too. However, thanks to the communist  revolution, that did not work. Then they planned World War II,  the invasion of Poland and Czechoslovakia. All this was planned  by Zionists. They thought that they would also be able to oust  the regime in our country. However, they miscalculated, in  particular as regards Russia. Everywhere they ousted  governments. They forced Germany to its knees and had a firm  grip on the country. And today Germany is no longer a danger to  us."    The reporter notes that, "in contrast to the group of old  communists and also in contrast to Gorbachev and Yeltsin, the  uninhibited populist is looking for contact with the people."  Zhirinovskiy is shown walking through a street, talking to  people, including a cripple sitting on the ground.    According to the reporter, "Zhirinovskiy is demagogically  exploiting mass fears of humiliation, fear of unemployment,  poverty, and crime." He says: "You will be even worse off when  you vote for the wrong people again. None of these parties will  save you. They are all too small for that. Today only a  government of personal power can still save the situation. The  former state -- despite its big disadvantages -- at least  produced the most powerful weapons in the world: nuclear,  chemical, bacteriological, and space weapons. Everyone was  afraid of us. This was a positive foreign policy factor.  People are afraid -- thus, one is respected. The entire world  is based on this principle."    Zhirinovskiy and his people are again attending communist  demonstrations. During one of these rallies, the reporter and  his camera team ask some of the demonstrators why they are here.  The people are extremely hostile toward the reporters and do  not want to be filmed. Many revile them as Jews.    The report concludes with clips of Zhirinovskiy's birthday  party. Regarding Zhirinovskiy's future plans, the reporter notes  that at the first meeting of the newly elected parliament,  Zhirinovskiy plans to put forward a motion for an immediate  amnesty of all the 1991 and October 1993 putschists.    This report is followed by a 10-minute report by Thomas  Amman  and Mark Brasse on Zhirinovskiy's "Greater German friends." The  report begins with clips of the search of the T.V.O. company  offices on 6 January, a former cover firm for the Socialist  Unity Party (SED) in Berlin, where material was found proving  that millions of German marks in SED property were illegally  transferred abroad after the upheaval in the GDR. Josef  Dierdorf of the Trust Agency notes that 4 million German marks  were transferred to some unknown place via the T.V.O. The money  seems to have ended up in secret accounts in East Europe.  According to the reporter, the main suspect is West Berlin  entrepreneur Werner Girke, who "discretely administered the  communists' assets abroad in GDR times."    Girke's impounded documents also show that he is reportedly  dealing with Russian neofascist Zhirinovskiy. Dierdorf notes  that "there are corresponding statements that one of Mr.  Zhirinovskiy's associates spent up to six weeks here at the  T.V.O. last summer and autumn and cultivated intensive contacts  there."    Then follow clips on Zhirinovskiy's meeting with DVU  Chairman  Gerhard Frey in Munich last December. Frey welcomes him by  saying: "Welcome! We are all happy to see you. Wonderful! A  wonderful victory, a great victory, fantastic. Congratulations!"    The report continues with footage on Zhirinovskiy's visit to  Austria. At Vienna's Schwechat Airport he says: "Today there  are many industrialists in West Europe that I would like to  meet. One must research economic problems more thoroughly. This  is the most important thing now. Today I am just coming from  Germany. Soon I want to go to Australia, perhaps also to Zurich  for a change."    In Austria, Zhirinovskiy is accompanied by his financial  adviser Aleksey Videnkin, the man who stayed with Girke last  year, according to the reporter. Zhirinovskiy was invited to  Austria by Carinthian industrialist Edwin Neuwirth.    From the Austrian Animal Protection Society, Zhirinovskiy  receives a cable that is read by one of his aides: "Dear Mr.  Zhirinovskiy. If Alaska is included in the Russian Empire, we  request that you make sure the local wildlife, in particular  grizzlies and seals, are protected. Thank you on behalf of the  Austrian Animal Protection Society. Anton (Zadik)."    In Austria, Zhirinovskiy also met with a number of European  businessmen. Regarding these meetings, Edwin Neuwirth says:  "When businessmen learned that he was visiting me, some people  from Slovenia and Croatia come -- not from Serbia, as was  reported. There was not a single Serb here. There were some  from Bulgaria, etc. These people knew him from past business  dealings. Thus, they discussed various things." Neuwirth  claims that he does not know what was discussed. When asked by  the reporter whether any businessmen from Germany were there, he  says "no" after hesitating for a fraction of a second.    The report notes that Zhirinovskiy and his troops were  attentively watched "by a dozen plainclothes investigators from  an antiterrorism unit of the Austrian State Police." When  Michael Sika, director general of public security, is asked  whether he knows whom Zhirinovskiy met, he says yes, the State  Police knows, but he refuses to comment on any details.    The reporter says that the journalists who were present did  not get to see any of the visiting businessmen, only  Zhirinovskiy, his bodyguards, and a certain Svetoslav Stoilov, a  Bulgarian exile who is Zhirinovskiy's liaison in Vienna.    Journalist Hannes Reichmann says: "An entrepreneurs' summit  took place. Entrepreneurs -- I put it cautiously, let us say  ambiguous entrepreneurs -- from all over Europe met here, who  already expect that Mr. Zhirinovskiy will soon become president.  I quote Stoilov, who said that it will take only four to five  months until Mr. Zhirinovskiy is president. He was unable to  explain how this would take place, but is convinced that it will  happen."    When Zhirinovskiy wanted to visit Germany again on 29  December, he was refused an entry visa. According to Neuwirth,  he had been invited by Werner Girke and his associates, who did  not even know that Zhirinovskiy would not be permitted to enter  but learned about this matter only when Neuwirth told them.    Foreign Minister Kinkel is asked about the entry ban and the  conditions under which he would be willing to receive  Zhirinovskiy. Kinkel says: "I refused to let Mr. Zhirinovskiy  enter the country. However, at the same time I stated that in  the future the matter will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis  as to whether or not he will be permitted to enter. I do not  want to speculate on such questions. I do not intend to give a  theoretical answer." Kinkel also refuses to comment on  Zhirinovskiy's activities in Austria, because he does not want  to "interfere in other countries' internal affairs." He also  claims not to know that Zhirinovskiy met with German businessmen  in Austria and says that, if this is true, this is the  businessmen's business.    The report concludes by noting that it is not yet entirely  clear what kind of business Girke has had with Zhirinovskiy.  Reportedly, the last time he transferred money to Moscow was on  30 December.</p>

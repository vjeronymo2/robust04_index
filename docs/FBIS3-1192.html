However, people in some suburbs have behaved and people have  been able to sleep, while others continue to shoot and throw  explosive devices. Our colleague Emmanuel Nzeyimana asked Major  Bambara in charge of security in Bujumbura town for more details  on the security situation last night. Here he is:    [Begin recording] [Bambara] Things are not as bad as they  were last night. In Nyakabiga the situation has improved but in  Cibitoke, Kamenge, and Kinama people continued shooting as  usual. In fact, yesterday they started the shooting earlier. A  military vehicle that was transporting food for the soldiers was  shot at in front of the zonal headquarters at 1700. Three  soldiers were injured. The shooting continued until this  morning. They were targeting military positions in particular.  That is how the security situation looks. There are not enough  of them to cause a disturbance.    [Unidentified correspondent] Many measures were taken  yesterday which are related to restoring security [words  indistinct]. How far have you gotten?    [Bambara] We started yesterday, since we were yesterday  ordered to put soldiers into position. We brought them in  yesterday evening.    We have already arrested a good number of people, especially  in the Cibitoke area. We have also seized a few weapons. They  are still continuing even now, they have been shooting at  security agents. [passage omitted] There are not many of them.  They shoot in groups of two to three, then change position,  moving behind houses so that we also shoot at houses. But we  are aware of this and that is why we do not respond, we just  wait.

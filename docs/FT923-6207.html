			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Bank of Japan issues grim report: Warning of slowdown lends support to rumours of cut in interest rates THE Bank of Japan yesterday issued one of its gloomiest economic reports yet, citing a slowdown in consumer spending and the likelihood of a prolonged reduction in industrial activity. Although the report draws no policy implications, it appears consistent with a recent spate of rumours that the central bank is preparing another cut in interest rates, perhaps in conjunction with a package of government emergency economic measures to be announced on Friday. Newspaper reports said yesterday that the ruling Liberal Democratic party had decided to approve more than Y8,000bn (Pounds 32bn) in extra fiscal spending, compared with a range of Y6,000bn to Y8,000bn originally under consideration. The central bank last reduced the official discount rate by half a point to 3.25 per cent at the end of July. The tone of the bank's report was borne out by a report from the Japan Department Stores' Association, which said sales in July dropped by 2.2 per cent, the fifth consecutive month of year-on-year declines. The falls included a 2.4 per cent drop in men's clothing sales, 11.8 per cent in furniture sales and 12 per cent in consumer electronics. In addition to sluggish consumer spending, the central bank cited declining capital goods shipments, declining capacity utilisation, the accumulation of capital stock and a decline in corporate profits. Perhaps most worrying, the bank said the declines in industrial production had failed to clear inventories, because of the unexpected weakness in demand. 'Inventory adjustments have generally been in a lull, and ongoing severe production restraint will probably be prolonged in most industries,' the bank said. Although the bank did not predict when inventories would reach normal levels, many private economists believe this may not happen until spring. Meanwhile, Mr Tsuneo Wakai, chairman of the Federation of Bankers' Association of Japan, said the banking industry was expected to finalise details by the end of the year on a plan to create a corporation that would buy property from banks being held as collateral for non-performing loans. The banks' capital base and profitability have been severely undermined by the burden of non-performing loans, which analysts estimate estimated at Y25,000bn to Y30,000bn. It is feared the banks would be unable to support any potential recovery in the economy unless a means can be found to clear balance sheets of bad assets. The market for land in Japan, however, is extremely sluggish. Mr Wakai, who is also president of Mitsubishi Bank, said it was unclear how such a corporation would be funded, and there remained thorny issues such as how to assess the value of land purchased. He said, however, that banks should find a way to fund the plan themselves, rather than rely on government money.</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Emerging markets Sceptics must be disappointed by the recent performance of emerging equity markets. After a strong rally in July and August, the IFC emerging markets index now stands 7 per cent above the level at the start of the year. As the chart shows, emerging markets have again been outpacing their counterparts in the developed world. For true believers this will not come as a surprise. The sharp correction of the first quarter was caused by the withdrawal of footloose international funds rather than setbacks in the emerging economies themselves. The attractive combination of high growth rates and economic liberalisation remains. Besides, falling share prices and rapidly rising earnings quickly transformed the valuation of many markets. The Asian markets which suffered most during the correction - Thailand and Malaysia fell by 25 per cent in the first three months of the year - have started to attract investors in search of value. But there are signs that the rally of the last two months has been more discriminating than the liquidity-fuelled bull run of 1993. While last year it was unusual for neighbouring emerging markets to move in opposite directions, this year performance has been wider spread. For example, Brazil has gained more than 70 per cent this year on hopes that the latest attempt to curb inflation will prove successful. Yet Argentina is still lower than at the start of the year. If long-term investors rather than high-rollers are now driving emerging markets, so much the better.</p>

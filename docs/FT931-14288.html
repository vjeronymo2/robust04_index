			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei improves in wake of government bonds rally A RALLY in government bonds boosted the stock futures market, and share prices closed higher with the support of arbitrage buying, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average ended 101.64 up at 16,617.24 on index-linked buying. Purchases by public funds supported the index in early trading; it fell later to a day's low of 16,502.26 on selling by investment trusts, but registered a high of 16,625.26 just before the close. Volume decreased to 140m shares from Thursday's 170m. Traders said investors remained on the sidelines after Friday's national holiday. In spite of the rise in the Nikkei, other indicators reflected underlying weakness. Declines outnumbered advances by 486 to 379, with 218 issues unchanged, and the Topix index of all first section stocks edged down 0.84 to 1,267.07. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was off 0.11 at 1,032.05. Reports of the US missile attack on Iraq had little impact on the Tokyo market. 'Japanese shares will not be affected unless there is drastic reaction on other overseas markets,' commented an analyst at Nikko Securities. Arbitrageurs sought shares as the futures market was buoyed by hopes of lower interest rates. Yields on the No 145 10-year government bond fell below 4.4 per cent for the first time since April 1988, as bond market participants were encouraged by the Ministry of Finance's outright purchase of bonds. Large-capital shares were actively traded by institutional investors, who cross-traded holdings to realise profits. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, firmed Y2 to Y288, while Mitsubishi Heavy gained Y1 at Y515. Video game makers fell on concern over allegations that video games had caused epileptic seizures among children. Sega Enterprises declined for the fourth consecutive day, ending Y80 lower at Y9,890, while Nintendo shed Y100 to Y10,400 on the Osaka stock exchange. Electronics issues were mixed, with Sony up Y70 to Y4,130 and Matsushita Electric Industrial ahead Y10 at Y1,110 on hopes regarding the expected economic recovery in the US. Toshiba slipped Y7 to Y607, weighed down by profit-taking. Sumitomo Electric Industries put on Y3 at Y808 on short-term buying by individuals on reports that the company's joint venture had developed a substance to reproduce hair roots. In Osaka, the OSE average edged forward 0.52 to 18,052.28 in volume of 53m shares. Roundup PACIFIC RIM markets were mostly firmer yesterday. HONG KONG saw late buying of blue chips by overseas institutions which helped to reverse an early decline. The Hang Seng index ended 10.22 higher at 5,882.02. Turnover fell to HKDollars 2.44bn from Friday's HKDollars 3.06bn, with investors restrained by continuing uncertainties about the Sino-British dispute over Governor Chris Patten's democratic reform package and US president-elect Bill Clinton's China policy. Demand from Chinese companies took Sun Hung Kai Properties 10 cents ahead to HKDollars 28.80 and Jardine Matheson moved 50 cents higher to HKDollars 46.75. AUSTRALIA saw a modicum of overseas interest and the All Ordinaries index appreciated 4.4 to 1,528.8 in turnover of ADollars 276.72m. A 16 cent rise to ADollars 13.28 by BHP was attributed to reassuring comments from the Papua New Guinea government about the future of the Kutubu oil field, in which BHP has a 9.6 per cent stake. SINGAPORE held mostly steady, but Malaysian stocks traded over the counter saw choppy early trade after reports that Malaysia's hereditary rulers had rejected proposed amendments to take away their immunity from the law. Later it emerged that a compromise was likely to be reached. The Straits Times Industrial index gained 4.6 at 1,577 in turnover of 88.8ms shares. KUALA LUMPUR moved erratically before closing on a higher note which saw the composite index up by 6.88 at 624.37. Multi-Purpose Holdings advanced 23 cents to MDollars 1.83 in active trading after an unconfirmed report that a Chinese city was to be allowed to hold a weekly lottery. SEOUL ended slightly firmer as buying, centred on large-capitalisation shares, outweighed some afternoon profit-taking. The composite index moved up 1.92 to 693.23 in turnover of Won529.61bn. MANILA slipped in reaction to news that the government intends to break up Philippine Long Distance Telephone's monopoly. The composite index declined 5.90 to 1,306.65. PLDT's share price, which ranged from 905 to 890 pesos most of last week, fell to 870. BOMBAY rose on sustained buying triggered by a belief that weekend changes in Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao's cabinet would spur India's economic reforms. The BSE index finished up 60.51 at 2,586.05.</p>

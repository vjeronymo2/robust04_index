			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Security Minister Leonard Nyangoma by Rupert </F> Neudeck in Germany; date not given -- recorded, in French with  superimposed German translation]    [Text] [Announcer Wolfgang Labuhn] After the complete  collapse of the state order in Rwanda in eastern Africa, fear of  similar developments is also growing in neighboring Burundi,  because in Burundi, too, there is a century-old conflict between  the tribes of the Hutu and the Tutsi. In contrast to Rwanda, in  Burundi it is still the Tutsi minority that rules the Hutu  majority and relies on the army, which is exclusively composed  of Tutsis. On the weekend, the Tutsi Army began to search  Hutus, who had been crammed into a stadium, for weapons, after  the armed forces had attacked the district of Kamenge, which is  inhabited by Hutus, in the capital city of Bujumbura.    This was a reason for my colleague Rupert Neudeck asking  Leonard Nyangoma, security minister of Burundi, about the  situation in Kamenge during his visit to Germany.    [Nyangoma] Since late afternoon of 28 April the Burundi  Army,  which consists exclusively of Tutsis, has started to bomb the  district of Kamenge in Bujumbura. This attack was carried out  with the heaviest weapons, that is, with artillery and grenades;  it is even said that Stalin organs were used. However, no  matter how this attack was carried out, it is quite clear that  the Hutu inhabitants of Kamenge are now victims of these attacks.    [Neudeck] Are there already figures about the victims, the  dead, and the destruction in Kamenge?    [Nyangoma] We do not yet have any exact figures, but I have  already been told that the number of dead is reportedly very  high. However, we have received reports that the Burundi Army  allegedly massacred about 2,000 people in the hills around the  capital city. Casualties in Kamenge must be very high, because  the Hutu people there are surrounded by the army, they cannot  flee anywhere, they have no protection at all.    [Neudeck] How can you explain this complicated situation to  the German public?    [Nyangoma] On 21 October 1993 there was the attempt to carry  out a coup d'etat, when the then president and his associates  were killed. The consequences are known. Internal ethnic  fighting flared again in Burundi. There also was heavy material  damage. Currently, we are again facing an imminent coup d'etat.  Nowadays the excuse used by the Burundi Army for torturing and  attacking the population is that the population must be disarmed.    We, the Government, basically agree with disarming the  population. However, there remains the question of who is  disarming whom. To the extent to which the Tutsi army has again  and again issued arms to its Tutsi compatriots since 1972, it  has completely given away the legitimation for disarming the  population, particularly, now, exclusively the Hutu population.    Therefore, the disarming, which is carried out now under  these conditions, is rejected by the people. It should be  carried out only by the international community.    There is a group of extremist Tutsis among the people that  does not want to accept the process of democratization in  Burundi. This group wants to guarantee the status quo. This  group enjoys so many privileges that it does not want to agree  to this process. They think that the process of transparent  democratization in Burundi will not leave them with their  privileges. This, however, is wrong, because since  democratization began in June 1993, no property rights --  neither of Hutus nor of Tutsis -- have been touched upon. This  group of extremist Tutsis wants to stop democratization, because  it is worried about its privileges.    [Neudeck] Mr. Minister, what do you ask of the German  Government and of the German people in this serious situation?    [Nyangoma] The people of our country are in a difficult  situation. Even the new institutions of democracy have been  taken hostage by the army. Since 21 October 1993, we have lived  like hostages. Unfortunately, our crisis in Burundi is not  really known abroad. The international community does not even  really see it. Germany, in particular, however, should know  about our crisis. I think that particularly Germany, as a  democratic country, should now react to our crisis. Germany  should alert the international community so that the people in  Burundi are helped in this extremely tense situation so as to,  in particular, solve the problem of this terrible coexistence of  an army in Burundi that is not neutral and the threatened  population. We are appealing to the international community to  help us organize a round table or a conference that might help  with reestablishing peace and security in this region.    [Neudeck] In what framework do you envisage a solution for  your country?    [Nyangoma] I believe that the solution should be tackled  bilaterally as well as multilaterally. An international  conference should be convened, with the particular participation  of our neighboring states, that is, Tanzania, Zambia, and Kenya,  but also with the help of those countries, which have long been  friends with Burundi. I am particularly thinking of Belgium,  France, and the United States. Of course, we also need the  support of the United Nations very much, just as of the  Organization of African Unity.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Doubts grow over US guarantees for Israeli loans EFFORTS in Washington to patch together a compromise over the Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.7bn) loan guarantees sought by Israel appear to be failing, amid fresh controversy over the US administration's intentions, including a report that Washington may cut its annual aid. Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, announced last week that the administration would not approve the loan guarantees while Israel continued to build new settlements in the Arab territories occupied since 1967. His statement, which coincided with the opening of the fourth round of bilateral Middle East peace talks in Washington, was bitterly denounced by Israeli ministers. Senator Patrick Leahy, who chairs the Senate subcommittee on foreign aid, has now admitted that wide differences are blocking the path to a possible compromise. In comments to reporters, he suggested even more controversially that Mr Baker had suggested making cuts in the annual Dollars 3bn that Israel receives in military and civil aid from the US. Mr Baker said last week that, if Israel wished only to complete housing under construction on the West Bank and in Gaza, it might be possible to do a deal on loan guarantees. He suggested deducting the costs of completion from the amount of the loans the US would guarantee. Senator Leahy said on Monday night that one of the biggest differences between his compromise ideas and those of the administration's was that Mr Baker had proposed to make the deductions not from the loan guarantees but from annual aid appropriations. The State Department quickly denied this, repeating Mr Baker's statement that no conditions should be attached to Israel's annual aid appropriation. However, a spokesman for Mr Leahy insisted yesterday that the senator stuck firmly with his assertion. Mr Leahy added that the whole question of political conditions being attached to foreign aid had further complicated the issues. 'Some in Congress still want to give basically a blank cheque,' he said. 'I'm not going to vote for a blank cheque in foreign aid for any country. I don't care whether it's Israel, Russia or any other country. I'm not going to do that, nor is the administration.'</p>

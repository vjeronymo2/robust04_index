			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: ROCK HUDSON FRIEND OF MINE BY TOM CLARK WITH DICK KLEINER  (PHAROS BOOKS: $18.95; 276 PP.)  </P> <P> In 1964, Tom Clark met Rock Hudson at a bridge game at the home of a mutual  friend. Clark, who at the time was a publicist at MGM, had met and worked with  a number of top stars and so he was not daunted by this first encounter with  Hudson.  </P> <P> According to Hudson's own posthumous autobiography ("Rock Hudson: His Story,"  actually written by Sara Davidson although Hudson initiated the project in 1985  when he was near death), the two men grew close and eventually became lovers.  In 1973, Clark moved into Hudson's home, where he lived until 1983, and he  later returned to help care for Hudson in the months before the movie star died  of AIDS-related diseases.  </P> <P> Now Clark has written his own book about their life together, but anyone  expecting a great love story will be sorely disappointed. Clark's book is more  that of a publicist than of an intimate.  </P> <P> He writes about the fabulous parties they gave, the trips they took and the  famous people they met. There are anecdotes aplenty. Clark portrays Hudson as a  somewhat innocent, friendly and sincere man who needed guidance, from someone  savvy like Clark, in both his personal and business affairs.  </P> <P> But Clark never acknowledges that their relationship went beyond being  roommates and business associates. It's an odd fact, given that their alleged  relationship was revealed in some detail in the Hudson-Davidson book.  </P> <P> It's also a missed opportunity. Hudson, who won only occasional accolades for  his acting, was one of the major sex symbols of Hollywood. If word had gotten  out to the public during his working years that he was a gay man, it surely  would have scuttled his career. Clark could have given us a fascinating  insider's view of this kind of secretive arrangement and the conflicting  emotions that must have gone along with it. At the least, he could have  acknowledged that side of Hudson's life and explain why he didn't want to write  about it.  </P> <P> "Rock Hudson: Friend of Mine" is not a completely gentle book -- Clark strikes  out with a vengeance at those who he feels misused Hudson. But it is a shallow  one. David Colker  </P></p>

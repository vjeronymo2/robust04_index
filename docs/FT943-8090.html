			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Mexican Elections: Wary peasants likely to go with the strength of the PRI Mexican farmers have yet to benefit from their country's much-touted economic transformation. The strict monetary policy, foreign competition and elimination of government programmes that have brought macro-economic stability have also produced an 18.5 per cent decline in agricultural production over 10 years and, one might think, fertile ground for the opposition in Sunday's presidential election. Yet voters in the countryside, those hit hardest by the cuts in government spending engineered by the ruling party's presidential candidate, Mr Ernesto Zedillo, when he was budget minister, are overwhelmingly going to turn out for him on Sunday, according to the few public opinion surveys that differentiate between urban and rural voters. With about a third of Mexico's voters located in rural areas, peasants are an important voting bloc for any party. And with the leftist opposition candidate, Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, betting on the rural vote to give him a fighting chance to dethrone the ruling party, officials of Mr Zedillo's Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) say maintaining their core of peasant support is of prime importance. By Ted Bardacke in Oxtotitlan, outside Mexico City In the past, the PRI was able to rely on fraud and intimidation by caciques  -rural strongmen who run the local PRI machines - to bring in the rural vote. In the 1988 presidential election, Mr Carlos Salinas de Gortari's margin of victory largely stemmed from rural polling stations that reported 100 per cent turnouts for the PRI. With electoral reforms in place and independent observers watching over polling stations, outright fraud is expected to be more difficult this year. Instead, the PRI is relying on government spending and the lack of true voting secrecy in small rural polling stations to sway the vote. The electoral authorities have decided to install 96,000 voting stations throughout the country, ignoring a demand by the opposition to reduce that number to 20,000 in order to heighten vote secrecy. The government has begun a new agricultural subsidy programme, called Procampo, which involves direct cash handouts of over Dollars 100 per hectare of farm land. Government cheques, which are often channeled through local peasant organisations affiliated to the PRI, were distributed up until a week before election day. Peasants are often required to submit copies of their voter identification cards in order to receive payment. 'You have to be on the side of the people who have the money, that's why everyone here votes for the PRI,' said one cacique in a village in the state of Mexico. 'The situation is difficult, there is no money. But the government, not the opposition, is the only one who can give, so you have to support it.' Voting in rural areas is still not secret, he says. 'There are two voting stations around here, each with fewer than 500 voters, and we all know who sympathises with which party,' he said. 'Simple maths after the election will tell me which families didn't vote as they promised to.' In addition to Procampo, subsidisies for purchases of tractors, fertiliser and fuel have also been announced by the government. High-profile ceremonies promoting such initiatives have been the norm, although official publicity about the programmes ended this month, so as not to taint the election. Opposition parties have attacked what they see as the influence that these programmes have on rural voters. Cutting off publicity about them 'is a recognition that they do indeed have an influence over voters and by that time the damage will already have been done,' Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, the leading opposition candidate, said recently. The government and the PRI say that Procampo is not a transitory election-year scheme, but is planned to last 15 years. But with both Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, the candidate of the centre-right National Action party, and Mr Cardenas promising to reform the whole system of agricultural subsidies, peasants are getting the message that the only way to continue receiving handouts is to vote for the PRI.</p>

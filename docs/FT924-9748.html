			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Fall-off found in company failures THE NUMBER of companies passing into receivership or administration last month fell for the ninth month running compared with the previous year, according to statistics released yesterday. The figures from the official London and Edinburgh Gazettes led Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, to predict that there will be a significant decline in the rate of medium-size business failures for the full year compared with 1991. There have been 4,317 failures in the 10 months to October this year, down 12 per cent on the same period last year.</p>

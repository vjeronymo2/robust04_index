			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Central Reserve Bank [BCR] President Roberto  Orellana Milla has said, "The main goal of the 1994 monetary and  financial program is to achieve economic growth and to create  job stability."    The goals established in the program for 1994 include  reducing inflation to 8-10 percent, achieving a production  increase (real GNP) of between 5 and 6 percent, increasing  employment, increasing savings and investments, increasing  exports, consolidating fiscal reforms, and increasing  competitiveness among banks.    During a lecture to the members of the Salvadoran  Association  of Business Administration Professionals, Orellana Milla said  social conditions were beginning to improve, per capita income  was on the rise, family income and job opportunities had  increased, and inflation was being reduced.    Orellana said: "Substantial progress has been achieved in  the  new economic system -- the social market economy. Thanks to  this new system, the economy is growing steadily and a reduction  in the fiscal deficit has been achieved." He also termed as  successful the financial reforms of recent years, adding that  the privatization of banks has engendered financial transactions  that are much more effecient than in the past. Moreover, he  said the stock market was rapidly growing and had great  potential, adding that greater access to international credit  has allowed businessmen a greater availability of funds for  mid-term investments.    According to the BCR President, the outlook for 1994 is very  encouraging, both for the financial system and the economy in  general. Nevertheless, he said there are major mid-term  challenges. He defined the challenges for the next five years as  follows: Reducing extreme poverty, broadening and consolidating  social policy, consolidating the social market economic system,  continuing to encourage high and sustained growth with its  corresponding creation of jobs, consolidating macroeconomic  stability, eliminating the fiscal deficit, effectively  integrating with the world economy, and reforming the state.    The BCR president concluded by saying, "The economy now  presents many opportunities for businessmen seeking new markets  and new business."</p>

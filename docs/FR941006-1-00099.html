This breakdown shall include estimated costs for office space rental, staff salaries, office supplies, equipment rental, telephone expenses, postage and other mailing costs, printing and storage. The breakdown shall estimate the costs that will be incurred in each category from the time the statement is submitted until the expected termination of the committee's political activity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Capital assets, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For purposes of this section, the term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> capital asset <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means any property used in the operation of the campaign whose purchase price exceeded $2000 when acquired by the committee. Property that must be valued as capital assets under this section includes, but is not limited to, office equipment, furniture, vehicles and fixtures acquired for use in the operation of the candidate's campaign, but does not include property defined as ``other assets'' under 11 CFR 9034.5(c)(2). A list of all capital assets shall be maintained by the Committee in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.11(d). The fair market value of capital assets may be considered to be the total original cost of such items when acquired less than 40%, to account for depreciation, except that items acquired after the date of ineligibility must be valued at their fair market value on the date acquired. If the candidate wishes to claim a higher depreciation percentage for an item, he or she must list that capital asset on the statement separately and demonstrate, through documentation, the fair market value of each such asset. The Commission may disallow all or some portion of the 40% depreciation if the asset was obtained by the primary committee for use in the general election, or falls within a presumption stated in 11 CFR 9034.4(b)(3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (f)(1) The candidate shall submit a revised statement of net outstanding campaign obligations with each submission for matching fund payments filed after the candidate's date of ineligibility. the revised statement shall reflect the financial status of the campaign as of the close of business on the last business day preceding the date of submission for matching funds.

This additional statement shall be due on a date to be determined and published by the Commission, which will be before the next regularly scheduled payment date. This statement shall reflect the financial status of the campaign as of the close of business three business days before the due date of the statement. The revised statement shall also contain a brief explanation of each change in the committee's assets and obligations from the previous statement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) After a candidate's date of ineligibility, if the candidate does not receive the entire amount of matching funds on a regularly scheduled payment date due to a shortfall in the matching payment account, the candidate shall also submit a revised statement of net outstanding campaign obligations. The revised statement shall be filed on a date to be determined and published by the Commission, which will be before the next regularly scheduled payment date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 23.

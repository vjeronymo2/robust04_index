			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, June 23 (CTK) -- The long-lasting dispute  over local administration which was the central theme of debate  in Wednesday's government session concerned whether there should  be one or two levels of administrative body between the  community and Parliament, Civic Democratic Party (ODS) Deputy  Chairman Jan Strasky told journalists today.    "The dispute is over whether this state, which is smaller  than it was under the Premyslids (kings from the 10th-13th  centuries), smaller than it was in the time from when the models  are being taken (when part of Czechoslovakia) should have a  state administration consisting of a central body, regions,  districts and communities," he said. Cost was another factor in  the ODS' reluctance to have two levels between the community and  state.    At issue was not the creation of an autonomous element (i.e.  some decentralization of the state's power] but the level at  which this ought to be created), Strasky said.    "It is clear to the ODS that the ideal number of autonomous  units does not approach 100, or 80 - the number of districts  today - but that it has to be smaller," he said.    He believed the ODS' coalition partners also admitted that  there was not and would not in the near future be sufficient  strength to get rid of any administrative body existing today.    If the government bill on higher units of local  administration were passed in the form suggested by deputy  premier Jan Kalvoda (ODS), this would mean setting up autonomous  regions, and then districts which would probably not have the  autonomy they now had, in addition to the communities and  central organs.    The most important thing was to find a solution which would  not shake the state administration and which would constitute a  first step, for in the building of inner structures of the state  there was never any final solution, Strasky said.</p>

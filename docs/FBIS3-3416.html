			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by XINHUA correspondents Min Fanlu (7036 0416 </F> 6424) and Li Anding (2621 1344 1353): "Stress Efficiency in  Promoting `Healthy' Development -- Assessing the Relationship  Between the Three Aspects of Sustained, Rapid, and Healthy  Development From What Was Said at the `Two Sessions'"]    [Text] Beijing, 18 Mar (XINHUA) -- China's economy has  grown 13 percent for two years in a row. This figure is  particularly striking at a time when the world economy is in a  recession. To maintain the strong momentum in our country's  economic development, in his government work report Premier Li  Peng underscored the six- character principle of "sustained,  rapid, and healthy" development.    The principle was formulated after careful consideration of  the actual state of our country's economic development. The  characters denoting "healthy" were recently introduced into this  six-character principle. It is the most discussed element among  National People's Congress [NPC] deputies and members of the  National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC], both during and after session.  It is viewed as a sign of maturity in the guiding ideology for  our country's economic construction.    The six characters constitute a dialectical unity and must  be  managed carefully. Seeking rapid development without regard to  sustained and healthy growth will hamper much-sought-after  progress, ultimately keeping us from proceeding rapidly. We  should place greater emphasis on quality and efficiency than on  quantity and growth rate. In the words of Tianjin deputy Gao  Dezhan, we should actively create conditions and stress both  quantitative and qualitative growth in economic development,  placing greater emphasis on the latter, so as to truly shift  toward the track of improving economic efficiency.    Healthy development and efficiency are interconnected. By  taking "efficiency" as the central task, we can find a  prescription for curing the on-again, off-again overheating in  China's economy in recent years. The two characters denoting  "healthy" are what people hope for and which serve as the  prerequisite for sustained and rapid economic development.    What is meant by healthy development? This means adapting to  market demands, stressing quality and efficiency, seeking  realistic growth rates, and avoiding intermittent bouts of  overheating and drastic fluctuations. CPPCC member Tian Yinong  said in vividly descriptive terms: "Suppose the economy is a  person with a fever. In the heat of an economic expansion,  people would rush headlong into mass action, and this would  result in an overextended investment scale. On the surface, the  economy would seem to be developing rapidly and spectacularly,  but once problems occurred, it would be subject to readjustment  and would contract. This erratic pattern would cause tremendous  losses, in effect slowing the economy."    Some aspects of our country's economy are clearly far from  satisfactory, despite the rapid economic development of recent  years. Hunan deputies Gao Jinping and Han Jian said: Some  localities are now trying to find a solution through an expanded  investment scale rather than through improved economic  efficiency. Not to be outdone, various localities are vying with  each other to start projects and seek fast growth rates.  Shandong deputy Mu Chengze said: "Once in office, town and  township cadres would take out loans, recklessly establish new  organizations, start projects, and walk away before witnessing  any results." These instances are not isolated cases. In the  end, it is the state which suffers. This kind of development  cannot be described as healthy.    According to information from the State Statistical Bureau,  the total investment made in fixed assets in 1993 amounted to  1,182.9 billion yuan, an increase of 50.6 percent over 1992; the  annual increase was the largest since the 1980's. The deputies  believe excessive investment causes fund shortages as well as  greater "bottlenecks" and inflation.    The NPC deputies and CPPCC members felt enlightened by re-  studying a passage of Comrade Xiaoping's brilliant exposition on  economic efficiency: "In our economic development, we should  strive to raise it to new levels every few years. Of course we  are not encouraging unrealistically high growth rates. We  should work in a down-to-earth manner, stress efficiency, and  achieve a steady and coordinated development." Comrade Jiang  Zemin has recently pointed out: "We should have new ideas for  our development, and should truly switch it onto the track of  enhancing economic efficiency. We must not continue taking the  road of blindly seeking high output value and growth rates, and  expanding the scale of investments." Shandong deputy Guo  Xinzhang had the following to say: Development includes  increased quantity and improved quality. Over the last several  years, the stress of our work has been placed on solving the  problems of insufficient total supply and of meeting the  people's basic needs in food and clothing. Now, some localities  should shift the stress to improving economic and product  quality. Economic quality includes economic structure, economic  efficiency, and labor quality.    It is precisely out of a consideration of enhancing economic  efficiency and stressing healthy development that the State  Council has set the 1994 growth rate at 9 percent. During their  discussion of the government work report, the NPC deputies  approved of the rate. They believe we will certainly make  remarkable achievements with sustained, rapid, and healthy  development so long as we maintain a healthy and genuine 9  percent growth rate for a number of years in a row.    Stress on economic efficiency is not a new topic, but it is  very difficult to ensure economic efficiency under the purely  planned economic structure. Our national economy has already  developed to a very large extent, and it cannot be further  developed healthily with artificial arrangements. The 14th  Party National Congress has made a policy decision on  establishing a socialist market economic structure. In order to  create the motive force for economic development, we must rely  on market forces to distribute resources rationally, and we must  stress economic efficiency.    While planning was law in the past, our production is now  guided by the market demand. Such a change has made it possible  for China to turn its "growth-rate-increase economy" into an  "efficiency- improvement economy." During the change of  operational mechanisms, many enterprises "turned to the market  instead of the mayor" in order to solve their problems. NPC  deputy and economist Li Boxi stated: Presently the economic  efficiency of our investment is very low because investment  ignores market demands. Many enterprises under construction are  bound to be losers. When they are completed, there will be no  market for their products, and a large quantity of their  products will lie idle in warehouses. For this reason, we must  reform the existing investment system and improve investment  efficiency. The key to success in this regard is to change the  government functions and allow enterprises to become the main  investors.    How can we enhance economic efficiency and maintain healthy  development? In pondering the question, many NPC deputies and  CPPCC members tried to get an answer from structural  readjustment and repeatedly emphasized optimization of the  industrial structure. Deputy Ni Zhifu pointed out: China is a  large country in which different regions have different economic  foundations and natural resource conditions. Each region must  consider its own reality and choose suitable main industries, as  well as other related industries. At the same time, it is  necessary to ensure the rational division of labor and  cooperation among regions and avoid uniform industrial  structures, so that all localities can give play to their  strength and make effective and full use of their economic  advantages and resources. Liaoning Governor and NPC Deputy Yue  Qifeng discussed Liaoning's second economic progress. He said:  In transforming an old industrial base, it is necessary to have  new ideas and not to blindly follow other's practices. It is  necessary to use high and new technology in developing a number  of new enterprises and transforming a number of old enterprises.  It is necessary to close down a number of old enterprises which  do not merit transformation. It is necessary to constantly  optimize the product mix and develop a number of  technology-intensive products which are high value-added, highly  marketable, bring high economic returns, and which will help  promote the province's economic development. Deputy Wang  Guangying, who is of noble character and high position,  suggested the use of foreign capital and technology in  invigorating inefficient large and medium state-owned  enterprises.    Economic efficiency is inseparable from product quality,  marketability, and after-sale service. During the two sessions,  Deputy Ma Yue, who is general manager of the Dongfeng Automobile  Company in Hubei, visited the Beijing service center of Dongfeng  automobiles and Fukang-brand sedans to seek users' comments on  15 March, which happened to be the "Consumer Rights Day." He  said: In the past, enterprises were responsible for planning  only. Now, they must be earnestly responsible to the users. If  we do not enlarge the scale of production rapidly to lower costs  and produce cars of a high level of technology, good quality,  and reasonable prices to satisfy users, we will not be able to  do anything but watch foreign companies seize all of China's  automobile market.    Only healthy development is genuine development, and only  effective development is genuinely healthy development. To put  more effort into "healthiness" and efficiency is the common  aspiration of the NPC deputies and CPPCC members attending the  two sessions, as well as the common aspiration of the people  across the country. If everyone in our country enhances his  awareness of efficiency and tries in every possible way to raise  economic efficiency, we will be able to promote the country's  modernization in a sustained, rapid, and healthy way.</p>

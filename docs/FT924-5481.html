			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: ABB declines 19% to Dollars 183m ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss engineering group, suffered a 19 per cent slump in pre-tax profit in the third quarter to Dollars 183m as recessionary conditions persisted in most of its key markets. Pre-tax profits for the year, expected to be similar to last year's, are now forecast to be 'somewhat below' last year's level. Order intake was up only 10.4 per cent to Dollars 6.9bn in the quarter, compared with an 18 per cent growth rate in the first half. 'In western Europe, there was an unexpected deterioration of demand in recent months for investment goods,' the group said. The turmoil in financial markets also provoked customers to delay projects. The intake for large infrastructure projects, particularly for power plants, remained strong, with Asian and Middle East markets showing good growth. Earnings in the power plant division were up, but the environmental control segment was hurt by weak demand in northern European construction markets. Restructuring of European operations was being stepped up in preparation for an increase in cross-border public procurement in Europe following the introduction of the single market next year. For the nine months, pre-tax profit was down 11 per cent to Dollars 679m on revenues up 4 per cent to Dollars 21.09bn. The order backlog on September 30 was Dollars 33bn, 28 per cent higher than a year earlier.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Letter: Rail action in Italy Sir, Robert Graham ('Rail chief gets tough', April 14), though generally well-informed and scrupulous, does not this time accurately describe the 'tough action' he writes about. Without any consideration of the merits of the conflict he recounts, it should in effect be noted that: 'unauthorised industrial action' does not exist in this country: no authorisation, by anyone, is ever necessary to go on strike, and therefore the employees who went on strike will not be penalised for having done so; management will rather 'deny pay increases' to those employees on strike against the very collective bargaining agreement that brought those increases to them: meaning they cannot eat and refuse the cake; it is not 'strikers' who are penalised through the pay packet, but those employees who refuse the pay increases won for them through collective bargaining by the most representative trade unions in the country. Including my union. Angelo Gennari, director, studies and research, Italian Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions (CISL). v. PO 21, 00198 Rome, Italy</p>

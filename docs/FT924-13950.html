			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / China 'must experiment' on economy: Fourteenth Communist party Congress told to embrace the continuing free market reforms CHINA should be bold in exploring new ways and 'dare to experiment' in changing from the old economic structure to the new, Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Communist party, told delegates to its 14th congress yesterday. Jiang, addressing the first congress since the fall of the Soviet Union, said that practice had showed that, where 'market forces have been given full play, the economy has been vigorous and developed in a sound way.' He foreshadowed further price and state enterprise reforms and an overhaul of China's elephantine bureaucratic structure. He revised China's target growth rate upwards, from 6 per cent to 8-9 per cent for each year to the end of the decade. He warned, however, that simultaneous prosperity for everyone was not possible, saying that China must allow and encourage some areas and individuals to grow rich first. Jiang held out little hope for any form of political reform, despite a pledge to improve the country's legal system. He said the goal of this reform was to build a 'socialist democracy' and 'absolutely not a western, multi-party, parliamentary system.' Diplomats said that much of what Jiang said on politics was defensive and underlined that, while the party was prepared to adopt western economic methods, it had set its face against western ideas. They doubted, however, whether China could absorb the west's economics and remain untouched by its political ideas. The decision by the Congress not to reappoint the Central Advisory Commission, a 190-member body containing the party's elderly members, and Jiang's encouragement for younger officials were seen as positive developments. He wrote off the June 1989 Tiananmen demonstrations for democracy - which ended in bloodshed after the military was called in - as 'a political disturbance' over which the party and government took a 'clear-cut stance.' The collapse of the Soviet Union last year was obliquely referred to as 'drastic changes in the international situation' which the party weathered calmly. Much of what Jiang said concerning economic reform had been well leaked before the Congress or had already begun to be implemented over the past year. As such, it came as little surprise to diplomats and observers in Beijing, but the very fact that he said it gave the measures the imprimatur of the party, they said. 'The people have now got a formal endorsement from the top to go out and make money,' one western banker observed. According to one western diplomat: 'Anything is almost possible in China and this document will give companies the ideological underpinning to get out and do what they want.' The top priority for China's leadership is the reform of the state industrial sector. 'We must change the way in which state-owned enterprises operate and push them into the market,' Jiang said. He foreshadowed the separation of ownership from management by making all large and medium-sized state enterprises legal entities which would be responsible for their own financial performance. Limited privatisation was also forecast with small state-owned companies to be leased or sold to collectives or individuals. Jiang indicated that the cost of change might be unemployment. He said the state should speed up the establishment of a social insurance system 'covering unemployment, old age and health and the reform of housing in the cities and towns.' Those responsibilities are at present borne by the state industrial sector. Reform of the price system was key to the success of economic reform, Jiang said. He said it was necessary to proceed more rapidly with price reform and establish a system where most prices are determined by market forces.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Arts: Lady Be Good - Theatre THE Open Air Theatre at London's Regent's Park, as I have written before, is one of the great pleasures of the English summer. Lady Be Good carries pleasure to perfection. Ian Talbot's production scores in every department: acting, singing, dancing, costumes and staging. It is also very amusing. Lady is not quite such a good musical as Guys and Dolls. It is a little too flapperish and one-dimensional for that, but with its featherweight touch it plays in the same division. Like the best of P G Wodehouse, it captures a world of innocence. Some of the characters indeed could almost come out of Wodehouse, such as Gavin Muir's Bertie Bassett, the obviously very well brought-up and thoroughly amiable young man with a tendency to take to the bottle and see pink spots. The girls belong to the world of Wooster as well: bright young things and occasionally predatory, like Jane Maud's wonderfully dressed Josephine Vanderwater. Ms Maud wears one of the best pair of shoes, usually concealed by her skirt, I have seen: black down one side, purple down the other. Such splendid details abound. There is an embrace between lovers where the lipstick comes off not smudged all over the man's mouth and cheeks, but precisely on his lips as if it had been the perfect kiss. The dialogue is very funny. Even the corniest of jokes come off because the period has been so well caught. 'I'm shaking like a fender on a Ford,' says Bernard Cribbins as Watty Watkins, the slightly shady lawyer. And again: 'He was trying to start the cuckoo clock with birdseed.' Cribbins gets away with a pun on the Spanish noces and the notches on the Mexican's gun. Simon Green as Dick Trevor, the impoverished lover, manages to say the line 'I'm so gosh darn blue' with real feeling. Cribbins is involved in a couple of scenes of purest comedy: one where he attempts to describe a bull fight he has never seen, another where he persuades Bertie Bassett to have a non-existent drink from a non-existent bottle, a non-existent glass and a sometimes existent waiter. If one dwells on the comic side, it is because it is such a marvellous and sustained complement to the music, which after all is by George and Ira Gershwin in their youth. The title song in Lady remains as irresistible as ever - almost impossible to get out of your head. There is also 'Just Another Rhumba' with that clever way of rhyming by pronouncing the 'b' in dumber, and which was not part of the original show. Add 'Fascinating Rhythm' which, according to a programme note by Benny Green, was heard by Gershwin pere as 'Fashion on the River'. You will not make that mistake in Regent's Park. Not least, there is 'I'd Rather Charleston': ('I'm not disappointed, I'm just double-jointed.') The singing and dancing are captivating throughout. They rely on the old but effective technique of starting with a twosome, then bringing in the ensemble. If there has to be a top prize, it must go to Joanna Riding, who sings, acts, dances and looks good non-stop. But do not forget the others, including Alister Cameron as an immensely tall Jeevesian flunkey, and the designs by Paul Farnsworth. You really ought to see Lady Be Good: you know that you should.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAY AREA QUAKE AFTERMATH AND FREEWAY SAFETY  </P> <P> Let us exalt the scores of civil authorities, rescue workers and others who  have helped in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake. Responding to their  highly diversified and demanding calls with alacrity, they have helped ease the  pain of this terrible tragedy. Many civilians, of their own volition, have  given their time, money and blood to assist in the recovery efforts. The way  the people of this state and country have pulled together to help the victims  of this terrible natural disaster shows our pre-eminence over others.  </P> <P> HELEN KNIPE  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] London AL-HAYAH in Arabic, on page four  of its 13 April issue, publishes an approximately 2,500-word  report by reporter 'Ali al-Ruzz in Stockholm. The report cites  interviews with three defecting Libyan officers, who are in a  Scandinavian country after fleeing Libya when their military  plot against the al-Qadhdhafi regime was discovered.    The report begins by saying that three Libyan officers  managed to flee Libya after participating in the "October  uprising" events. It adds: They are, perhaps, the only members  of the secret military organization who escaped the arrests and  managed to reach safety after having traveled for five months in  Arab and foreign countries, and they are now members of "the  National Front for the Salvation of Libya."    The three defecting Libyan officers, whom AL-HAYAH met in a  Scandinavian country, are:    1. Lieutenant Colonel pilot Muhammad Bashir Salih, 36, born  in Bani Walid, who joined the Libyan Army in 1978 and received  training in Yugoslavia and Russia. He says that in 1988 he  considered playing a role that would effect a change in Libya,  and that he joined a secret military organization led by Major  'Abd-al-Salam al-Wa'ir in 1991 after the latter talked to him  about this organization.    2. Major 'Abd-al-Salam al-Wa'ir, 38, born in Bani Walid.    3. Captain Salim Dabnun Muhammad al-Wa'ir, 31, from Bani  Walid.    Lt. Col. Salih points out that "the Libyan situation  compelled me to think in this way because we do not have a  state, institutions, laws, or a constitution." Discussing the  role of the al-Warfallah tribe in the military rebellion, Maj.  al-Wa'ir says: "The fact that most participants in this military  action belong to the al-Warfallah tribe does not mean that other  tribes did not take part." He adds: "As officers, we all agreed  to hand the authority over to a civilian if our movement  succeeded. He is Dr. Muhammad Yusuf al-Maqrif and he does not  belong to the al-Warfallah tribe."    Regarding how this secret military organization was  established, Maj. al-Wa'ir says that he was the first one who  had the idea of establishing this organization. He adds: "Since  my graduation in 1980, the Libyan Army has been sent on missions  whose objectives were not known to us. We fought in Chad and  Uganda, and in 1987 I stayed in Lebanon with the force of  volunteers to champion the so-called the nationalist and Islamic  forces and assist Palestinian organizations. In December 1988,  I returned to Libya and briefed a group of officers on the idea  of the organization. There were just five of us. Afterward, I  went back to Lebanon in 1990, and I met with Colonel Mustafa  Balqasim in an Arab state and briefed him on the organization.  We agreed that he would act in one direction and I would act in  another direction in absolute secrecy. I once again returned to  Libya at the end of 1991, and finalized the establishment of the  organization whose membership reached 10. I believe that the  number of members in Mustafa's organization was similar to ours."    Discussing their story with the Salvation Front, Maj.  al-Wa'ir indicates that in 1992 he briefed Col. Balqasim on the  need to open a channel of communications with this front abroad  because "it is the only effective faction, and because we  received news about it through smuggled newspapers or radios,  and also because the Front's members are known in Libya for  their honesty and efficiency. Balqsim concurred."    Maj. al-Wa'ir adds that in 1993, a third organization led by  Colonel Miftah Qarrum, who suffers from leukemia, joined the two  organizations, and that "following several contacts and  meetings, a plan of action was agreed, and was to be implemented  no later than the spring of 1994. I agreed with Balqasim and  Qarrum on the broad outlines of the program designed to topple  the regime and on the transitional period. There was one  objective; namely, to topple the regime and establish a  democratic constitutional state."    Concerning the details of the coup attempt, Cap. al-Wa'ir  discloses that, according to the plan of action, military units  would move in Tripoli, Banghazi, Misratah, Tarhunah, Sabratah,  and Gharyan. He also revealed that the targets of the coupists  were the army command headquarters in Bab al-'Aziziyah, the  intelligence directorate, the al-Jamahiriyah security  commission, and centers belonging to a group of the Republican  Guard battalions. However, he adds, the Libyan regime  discovered the plan, so the coupists sought to implement the  plan on 15 October but the arrests and confrontations with the  regime began on 12 October, so the coup attempt failed.    The report cites Lt. Col. Salih as saying that on 12 October  the Libyan military intelligence arrested Col. Miftah Qarrum,  Col. Mustafa Balqasim, Major 'Ali al-Kakli, Major Khalil  al-Jadak, Major Ramadan al-'Ayhuri, and other officers.    Concluding, the report cites Major al-Wa'ir as refuting the  claims that the organization's officers recently shown on Libyan  television were spying for the United States and stressed that  these officers are honorable ones who were only agents working  for Libya.</p>

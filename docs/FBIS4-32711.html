			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 28 June (MTI) -- Hungary's new Parliament  ended its first session today. The next plenary session will  take place next week.    On behalf of the outgoing government, Prime Minister Peter  Boross greeted the new National Assembly and the new  parliamentary officials.    The acting prime minister gave a short summary of the  governing coalition's activities over the past four years.    Boross pointed out that Hungary has become a genuinely  independent, sovereign country, both in political and economic  terms, while, simultaneously, the institutions of parliamentary  democracy and rule of law have been established. The political  stability marking the past few years as well as the recent  elections have proven the viability of this new, deeply-rooted  system of institutions, he said.    Concerning the transformation of the country's economic  structure, Boross recalled that the establishment of a market  economy started in the absence of both of the main components;  namely, proprietors and capital.    Addressing foreign-policy issues, Boross said that after  four  decades of isolation, Hungary not only found 70 percent of its  markets in the advanced industrial states, it also got involved  in the work of the Council of Europe, the Conference on Security  and Cooperation in Europe, and the European Parliament, and it  signed an association agreement with the European Union.    The acting prime minister stressed that his government never  forgot about the ethnic Hungarian communities abroad, which it  always considered to be an integral part of the nation.    In conclusion, Boross announced that, in keeping with the  constitution, the mandate of his government has now expired.  From now until the formation of the new government, the  outgoing government will operate as a caretaker government with  limited powers, he said.    The deputies resolved to put two joint proposals by Prime  Minister Designate Gyula Horn and Deputy Prime Minister  Designate Gabor Kuncze on the agenda and label them "urgent."  The first proposal is to amend the list of ministries of the  Republic of Hungary, as the new government wishes to dissolve  the Ministry of International Economic Relations. The second  proposal is to amend the law on the legal status of mayors in  such a way that holding the post of mayor should no longer be  incompatible with also being a deputy.    Speaker Zoltan Gal said that Jozsef Torgyan, parliamentary  leader of the Independent Smallholders' Party, proposed that  Parliament should set up committees to investigate both the  explosion that destroyed a door of the Parliament building on  June 11, and the brutal police action that followed the recent  soccer cup final between the teams of Kispest-Honved and  Ferencvaros. The proposal can be put on the agenda only if  Torgyan presents 78 supporting signatures for it, Gal said.    The Speaker said Acting Prime Minister Peter Boross informed  him that the current government withdraws all its proposals  presented to, but not yet discussed by, Parliament, with the  exception of reports and information materials. The prime  minister added that he is responding to the request by the  chairmen of the Hungarian Socialist Party and the Alliance of  Free Democrats with this step.    Gal announced that, in keeping with the constitution, he has  called for a special session of Parliament on July 4-5, to make  decisions on the proposals labelled "urgent."    At the end of the founding session, the recording secretary  of Parliament read out a letter by Boross to the Speaker in  which the acting prime minister announced that, after  coordination with the parliamentary parties and an agreement  with the new governing parties, he proposes that the President  of the Republic should relieve Hungarian Television Deputy  President Gabor Nahlik and Hungarian Radio Deputy President  Laszlo Csucs of their post.</p>

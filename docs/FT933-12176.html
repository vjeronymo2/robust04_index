			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Survey of Cardiff Bay and the Barrage (6): Fewer homes but more jobs - The economy: consultants predict even more investment than expected / KPMG made its initial assessment of the consequences of the barrage in October 1987. Anthony Moreton analyses the firm's latest report on its likely impact A DECISION to go ahead with the barrage will have a very positive impact on the economy and job prospects in the Cardiff region. This is the main conclusion of a report by KPMG Management Consultants, commissioned by Cardiff Bay Development Corporation. It says that the barrage will lead to much greater investment than expected, and certainly more than would be achieved by a development without the barrage. 'The informal target' set by the Welsh Office of a leverage of four to one will be substantially exceeded,' the report states, which puts the likely private-to-public spending ratio at 7.5 to one. The number of additional direct jobs likely to be created is also estimated to be around 78 per cent higher than without the barrage. In total, the barrage is expected to support 23,200 permanent jobs in the Bay area. In the construction sector alone, the number of projected extra jobs - at around 16,500 person-years - is around 88 per cent higher than would have been the case if there had been no barrage. KPMG made its first economic assessment of the consequences of the barrage in October 1987, soon after the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation had been set up. A shortened version of this appraisal was published nine months later and the original report was updated at the start of 1990. The report was put before the corporation in February. By comparison with the 1990 document, the present report sees a reduction in the number of houses and flats as a result of fewer developments on sites away from the long waterfront. This is a consequence of the corporation's land-use proposals, an increase in the number of properties facing water and significantly reduced development around the inner harbour and some other parts of the bay area. The real capital cost of the barrage has increased by Pounds 9.01m since 1990, according to KPMG, or around 6 per cent. Of this rise, Pounds 4.63m represents the increased cost of remedial work for groundwater protection following representations from people living alongside the river in Cardiff, who feared a rise would occur in the water table as the result of the impounding of water behind the barrage. Total project investment costs in the barrage are Pounds 497.1m, a fall of around 21 per cent in real terms since 1990. The main reasons for the drop have been changes in site preparation and the uncommitted costs of the Butetown link, the road between the bay and the city centre. The estimated costs of the barrage are put at Pounds 152.76m at mid 1992 prices, but on some calculations the eventual cost could be as much as 15-18 per cent lower. The main cost, according to KPMG, is Pounds 47.55m for earthworks, followed by Pounds 39.62m for the lock structures. Sluices would be Pounds 18.03m and the sewerage system Pounds 14.8m. The costs of improving groundwater defences and of building a new home for the displaced birdlife - two important issues raised by opponents - are put at Pounds 14.43m and Pounds 5.67m respectively. The report warns there is room for a significant margin of error in estimating the costs of the required infrastructure and site preparation work. Nevertheless, the conclusion drawn by the bay's economic consultants is that the net economic effects will be considerable.</p>

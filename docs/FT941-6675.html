			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / The Personal Pensions Time Bomb: Legal &amp; General probes alleged breach of rules - Peter Marsh on claims that illicit payments were offered by sales agents Legal &amp; General, the insurance company, is investigating allegations that an employee of one of its sales agents offered money to former mineworkers in an effort to arrange contacts with prospective clients. The allegations concern Mr Jack Parry, an employee of Surebond, a 24-person company based in Brampton near Rotherham, South Yorkshire, which sells pensions and other investment products on L&amp;G's behalf. The allegations are denied by both Mr Parry and Surebond. If substantiated they could mean L&amp;G facing a public rebuke from Lautro, the insurance industry watchdog, or a fine for failing to control Surebond's activities. If the allegations were proved they would mean Surebond had breached industry guidelines which prohibit pension-industry employees from offering cash inducements to other people for lining up possible sales. Mr John Church and Mr Dave Nixon, two former mineworkers who are both NUM mining union officials, told the FT that Mr Parry offered them cash to provide the names of other NUM members who might be interested in switching out of the British Coal pension scheme into personal pensions. Mr Church and Mr Nixon said the offers had been made on two occasions in the NUM offices at Bentley and Hatfield collieries, where the two men were NUM branch secretaries. At both sets of discussions, which took place around the time of the closure of the two pits in November, only the NUM official and Mr Parry were present. It is alleged that in both cases the offer was Pounds 50 for an initial contact, followed by Pounds 50 for a formal exchange of pension papers between Surebond and British Coal and a further Pounds 50 if the miner formally switched pensions. The affair underlines controversy about sales methods used by some insurance and pension companies in the Yorkshire region, where 12,000 miners have been made redundant in the past two years. British Coal said the region had been blitzed by the pensions companies, seeking out redundant mineworkers who might wish to transfer their pensions into private schemes. It said questionable advice had been given in some cases. In the past two years an estimated 6,000 former miners from the Yorkshire region have switched out of the British Coal scheme for personal pensions, most of them soon after losing their jobs. The value of these transfers is estimated at Pounds 150m. Mr Parry, a former miner, has worked for Surebond for a year, based in rooms rented in a disused school. His job is to introduce possible clients to the company's sales staff. He said he had talked to NUM officials at Bentley and Hatfield but had not offered money. The allegations were 'a downright lie'. Mr Peter Kettell, Surebond managing director, said: 'There is no way Jack would offer money. Lautro would hit the roof if they thought we were making inducements.' In a letter to the FT asking it to pass on details, L&amp;G said it had started an investigation into the allegations. Lautro also said it would be studying the affair. Nine of the 10 NUM branch secretaries at the Yorkshire pits that closed have told the FT that pension companies offered them either money or jobs for handing over lists of names. In many cases the job offers were linked to the NUM officials using contacts among former mineworkers to find people interested in leaving the British Coal pension scheme for private pensions. The facts in most of these cases are difficult to substantiate, but interviews suggest that other pensions groups may have tried to target NUM officials as a way to arrange contacts with former miners. Mr Kev Coates, NUM branch secretary at Markham Main near Doncaster, South Yorkshire, which closed last year, said he received a phone call from someone claiming to be an agent working for the Leeds office of Allied Dunbar, the insurance company. He said the man, who gave his name as Jonathan, offered him Pounds 1,500 for the names and addresses of the 700 NUM members at the mine. Allied Dunbar said it could not trace anyone at the Leeds office who had made the call. An approach of this kind would be 'irregular'. Mr Steve Tulley, NUM branch secretary at Frickley colliery, which closed in November, said two men who said they were from the Pearl insurance company visited his house twice to talk about a job. This was on the basis that he could use his contacts to sell pensions and other investment products. Pearl said it could find no evidence of these visits. If the story could be substantiated Pearl would 'take a serious view as this isn't the way the company operates'.</p>

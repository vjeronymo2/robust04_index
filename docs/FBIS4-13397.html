			<p>BFN     [Text] Jordan's chief delegate to Middle East multilateral  peace talks on water sharing has said Jordan participated in the  fifth round in Oman as an observer.    Dr. Mundhir Haddadin said Jordan's low-key participation was  to protest the failure of American naval forces to lift the  blockade of the Port of al-'Aqabah.    He said His Majesty King Husayn had made it clear that  Jordan's participation in the fifth round of water talks would  be at the observer level if inspections of Jordan-bound ships  continued.    Dr. Haddadin said Jordan would also scale down its  delegations to other multilateral talks if the blockade on  al-'Aqabah persisted. He said the fifth round of talks on  disarmament and regional security would be held in Qatar early  next month, and talks on refugees and economic development would  convene in Egypt and Morocco respectively.    Forty countries, including Israel, are attending the Oman  round and Jordan is represented by the adviser to the minister  of water and irrigation.    In the previous four sessions at the water conference,  Jordan  had participated with a six-member delegation.</p>

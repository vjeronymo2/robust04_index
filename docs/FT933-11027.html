			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Wolstenholme Rink expands in resins WOLSTENHOLME Rink, the printing industry supplier, has bought the varnish and resins division of Leon Frenkel, a privately-owned company in Kent, for Pounds 3.93m An initial payment of Pounds 3.15m will be satisfied by the issue of 350,000 shares at 460p and Pounds 1.54m in cash. The shares have been placed by Cazenove and Henry Cooke Lumsden, the placing being underwritten by Cazenove. The final Pounds 775,000 will be paid after Frenkel has moved its other businesses, involving the mixing and bottling of cooking and salad oils, from the building which houses the varnishes division and is expected to be made within two years. The sale proceeds will be used to finance the move to a new factory near the existing site. In the year to the end of October 1992, the resins and varnish division made pre-tax profits of Pounds 161,000 on turnover of Pounds 5.7m out of group profits of Pounds 755,000 and turnover of Pounds 24.3m. The acquisition continues Wolstenholme's policy of making acquisitions geared to international expansion, which began with its takeover of PCO, the Netherlands-based speciality chemicals group in 1991. Varnishes, and the resins are used to manufacture them, make up the liquid element of printing inks and the purchase completes a vital piece of the printing products jigsaw for Wolstenholme. Mr Tony Rink, Wolstenholme's joint chairman, said: 'We are building a portfolio of products that we can sell to the international print ink industry.' Wolstenholme's share price closed unchanged at 475p.</p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / International Bonds: Demand holds up for floating-rate notes A FURTHER offering of subordinated floating-rate notes with minimum and maximum coupon levels brought the total amount of 'collared' floaters in the past two weeks to about Dollars 2bn, confounding dealers' predictions of limited demand. The latest deal was a Dollars 100m offering of 10-year notes by De Nationale Investeringsbank, the 50 per cent Dutch government-owned investment bank. The notes pay interest of  1/8 point below the London interbank offered rate, with a minimum coupon of 5 1/8 per cent and a maximum coupon of 10 per cent. The deal was arranged by Morgan Stanley International. Demand continues to be concentrated among Swiss retail and small institutional investors, with an appetite for dollar paper yielding more than current money market rates. Elsewhere, Aegon, the Dutch insurance company, launched a Fl 500m offering of subordinated floating-rate notes via ABN Amro. The notes pay interest at the six-month Amsterdam interbank offered rate for the first two years, then pay a fixed coupon of 8 1/4 per cent for the rest of the life of the issue, which matures in 2004. BRITISH GAS yesterday lost its triple-A debt rating from Moody's, when its Pounds 3.6bn of long-term debt was downgraded to Aa2 by Moody's. It had been under review for possible downgrade since May. The move follows a similar action last week by Standard &amp; Poor's, the other leading US agency, which cut the company's rating to double-A plus. The agency cited the company's changing structure, as it invests in exploration and production, increasing competition in the UK, and regulatory constraints.</p>

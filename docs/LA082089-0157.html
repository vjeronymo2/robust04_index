			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NORMAN REACHES FINAL OF INTERNATIONAL TOURNAMENT  </P> <P> Greg Norman scored an eagle on the 17th hole and forgot about it.  </P> <P> Norman made his way into the final of the peculiar International golf  tournament Saturday at Castle Rock, Colo., and immediately started talking  about today.  </P> <P> "Now it's on to the Super Bowl," Norman said. "The playoffs are over, and we're  going to the Super Bowl."  </P> <P> The field of 72 has been reduced to 24 players who will compete today for the  bulk of the $1-million purse, of which $180,000 goes to the winner.  </P> <P> No scores are carried over. All start at zero under the modified Stableford  scoring system, in which an eagle is worth five points, a birdie scores two, a  bogey costs one point and a double bogey and higher cost a player three points.  Pars are worth nothing.  </P> <P> It took six points Saturday to make the final round.  </P> <P> Norman was at six points through 16 holes, then hit a six-iron second shot  eight feet from the cup and made the putt for an eagle three on the 17th. He  finished with 11 points, making his final putt just moments before a  thunderstorm caused a one-hour delay.  </P> <P> Norman was joined at 11 points by Chip Beck and Ben Crenshaw.  </P> <P> Ted Schulz led all players with 14 points after making seven birdies in a  bogey-free round.  </P> <P> Jack Nicklaus made a four-foot bogey putt on the final hole and finished with  six points.  </P> <P> "It looked like a very long putt," he said.  </P> <P> Tom Kite also was in danger of leaving early but birdied two of the last three  holes to finish with nine points.  </P> <P> Among those who didn't make the final were Ryder Cup captain Ray Floyd, Lee  Trevino and Craig Stadler.  </P> <P> Al Geiberger shot his second straight four-under-par 68 to take a two-stroke  lead over Mike Hill and Dave Hill in the $350,000 GTE Northwest tournament at  Seattle.  </P> <P> Geiberger had a 136 total after 36 holes on the 6,501-yard Inglewood Country  Club course. Mike Hill shot a 66, matching the lowest round of the day, while  his older brother, Dave, had a 70.  </P> <P> Bob Erickson also shot a 66 and was tied at 139 with Frank Beard and  first-round leader Miller Barber. Beard shot a 70, but Barber slipped to a 74.  </P> <P> Peter Senior of Australia shot a seven-under-par 65 and took a three-stroke  lead after three rounds of the $500,000 PLM Open at Malmo, Sweden.  </P> <P> Brian Henninger of Eugene, Ore., shot his second consecutive six-under-par 66  to take a two-stroke lead after three rounds of the Queen Mary Open at Lakewood  Country Club.  </P> <P> Henninger's 200 total, 16 under par, was one better than the tournament record  for 54 holes set by John McComish last year.  </P> <P> Kevin Sutherland of Sacramento was second at 202 after shooting a 69.  </P> <P> Ted Lehmann of Simi Valley was third at 204 after shooting a 68.  </P></p>

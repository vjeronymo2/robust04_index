			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Apr 05, BNS -- Russia is neglecting the June  2, 1993, agreement with Latvia on the use of the Latvian  airspace by Russian military aircraft, officials said.    Moreover, Russia proposed the Latvian Communication Ministry  to sign a new agreement which provides for free use of the  airspace and airport services, said Ilgonis Upmalis, head of the  Latvian bureau monitoring the Russian troop withdrawal.    The Russia-proposed agreement also foresees free movement  for  aircraft that brings its troops out of Germany.    Under the earlier, neglected document, Russia must pay  Latvia  for services in accordance with the Communication Ministry  tariffs. In total, Russia owes more than 25,500 lats to the  Riga airport and 251,500 U.S. dollars to the Latvian Air  Communication enterprise.    Russia wants to start all calculations of arrears starting  with the day when the new agreement is signed. Latvia, however,  insists that the issue of payments be tackled regardless of any  further agreements.    Under the draft agreement, Russia will operate free flights  in the Latvian airspace to maintain and repatriate Russian  troops in the Baltic states and Germany. But, Upmalis said, it  would be impossible to detect which flights are actually needed  for these purposes.    The Latvian Communication Ministry is unlikely to sign up to  the Russian proposal and it will also demand the repayment of  the debt, said Uldis Petersons, a spokesman for the ministry.    On the other hand, the new agreement is necessary because  the  1993 document was only a purpose agreement, Petersons noted.</p>

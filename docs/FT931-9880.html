			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Minister denies juice hazard THE government yesterday denied that it had put public health at risk by allowing the continued sale of apple juice which contained high levels of a chemical that can cause cancer and birth defects, John Willman writes. The Ministry of Agriculture confirmed that high levels of patulin, produced by moulds on rotting apples, had been found in five out of 32 samples of apple juice tested in March. Mr Nicholas Soames, the food minister, told the Commons that the levels of patulin discovered in the juice were not considered an 'immediate hazard to health'. The minister said a report would be published next month, but Mr Gavin Strang, Labour agriculture spokesman, said the government should have published the test results last year and 'removed all toxic juice from the shelves'.</p>

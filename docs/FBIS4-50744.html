			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 19 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--A spokesman  from the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office  spoke about the dismissal of Mr. Anthony Cheung Bing-leung from  the post of Hong Kong affairs adviser.    The spokesman said: All of the Hong Kong affairs advisers  jointly recruited by the State Council Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office and XINHUA Hong Kong Branch are appointed in a  personal capacity, but party representatives will never be  invited to take up such posts. This point was repeatedly stated  when the Hong Kong Affairs advisers were appointed. However,  after accepting his appointment as a Hong Kong affairs adviser,  Mr. Cheung claimed that if the "Democratic Party" Central  Committee decided that there was no need for someone to act as a  Hong Kong affairs adviser and that person must resign, he would  follow the decision. This violates our above-mentioned  principle of recruiting Hong Kong affairs advisers and is thus  unacceptable.    The spokesman also said: In the future, Mr. Cheung is still  welcome to give us, in a personal capacity, useful and  constructive advice about Hong Kong's prosperity and stability  and a smooth transition.</p>

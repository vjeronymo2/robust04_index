			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / World Trade News: Seeking a Third World accord after a near miss - An assessment of progress in OECD talks on subsidy reductions for export credits WEEK-LONG talks in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have broken up without final agreement on a package of subsidy reductions for export credits and tied-aid loans to developing countries, but hopes remain that a deal can be struck before June. Participants described the outcome as a 'near-miss' rather than a breakdown, after two years of often contentious discussion. A further meeting is expected about May 17 to see whether final agreement is possible. They said the outlines had now emerged of a possible package which would: Eliminate routine interest rate subsidies on export credits to all developing countries, although a transition period would be allowed for loans to the poorest countries. Impose strict limits on the use of tied-aid credits (export credits sweetened with aid funds). The draft package lists a range of circumstances in which such credits would be banned altogether unless they had a minimum grant element of 80 per cent, making them prohibitively expensive. Everything now hinges, though, on whether agreement can be reached on how the package would be implemented. Delegates said it was still far from certain whether hard-line governments, such as that of the US, would consider it had enough bite to be worth accepting. Under the draft, the 80 per cent minimum grant rule would apply to credits for all projects which would normally be commercially viable. Exception would be made for deals involving the poorest developing countries as well as some slightly better-off nations that are still eligible for concessional loans from the World Bank's IDA affiliate. The minimum grant would also apply on all tied-aid credits, regardless of the commercial viability yardstick, to richer developing countries. These are defined as countries too prosperous to be eligible for World Bank loans of more than 17 years, the ceiling now being per capita income of Dollars 2,335. The 80 per cent minimum grant might also apply on loans for all unusually large projects, starting with those whose value was about Dollars 100m. Conditions such as these should be sufficient, in theory, to allay US worries that markets for certain products, such as telecommunications, were being spoiled by mixed credits. The US has also become worried about the way in which mixed-credits have become necessary to win any capital goods business at all in certain countries, such as Indonesia. Considerable uncertainty remains, even so, about the definitions and implementation. In particular, delegates say there is no agreement yet about how to define the yardstick of commercial viability. Only if points such as this can be ironed out will it be possible to present a package to finance mninisters for ratification at the OECD annual meeting in June. A further issue which remains to be settled is the degree to which the package would be enforceable. Some exemptions might be allowed, but only after detailed consultation procedures, culminating in some cases with the donor country being forced to make a written explanation to the OECD secretary-general.</p>

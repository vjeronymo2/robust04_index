			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Germany sheds 11.5% of workforce GERMAN industry shed 11.5 per cent of its workforce in the year to the end of June, dramatically reducing the impact of high wage settlements on its costs. Numbers employed in manufacturing and mining fell 1.1m to 8.3m, according to a report from the federal statistics office. Even though wage settlements averaged 7 per cent, industry's pay costs rose just 1.5 per cent. Wage bills in the west increased 2.8 per cent, and fell 15 per cent in the east. The fall in the former GDR was due to a 50 per cent cut in the industrial workforce, which left only 953,000 in work, and a reduction in the west of 150,000. The figures underline the seriousness of the state of the east German labour market, seen as an important factor behind the past four day's attacks on foreigners and police in Rostock, the stricken shipbuilding town on the Baltic. They also demonstrate the fading ability of western industry, the country's main wealth generator, to maintain expansive employment rates seen in the past 10 years. Publication of the statistics followed recent warnings of further heavy job cuts by many leading companies, and coincided with an unofficial report that a further 1m jobs are earmarked for the axe. The state railways and postal services alone plan to reduce their payrolls by 200,000, and steelmakers are planning to cut 33,000. According to the federal statistics office, capital goods manufacturers shed 83,000 jobs in the year under review, consumer product companies lost 33,000, and the mining workforce fell 10,000. Blaming high wage costs, more than 40 per cent of German companies employing 500 people or more, have posted plans to reduce personnel. Meanwhile, western industry increased its total sales in the first half by 1.8 per cent to DM980bn, (Pounds 351.2m) and raised overseas turnover by 2.8 per cent to DM266bn. Sales by eastern factories and mines, hit by restructuring and the loss of east European markets, fell almost 8 per cent to just DM44bn. The official figures also demonstrate how far industry in the former GDR has to go to catch up with that in the west. Wage bills in the east are equivalent to almost 18 per cent of sales, compared with less than 4 per cent in the west. Average west German inflation is expected to have stabilised during August despite an unexpected increase reported from the state of Hesse yesterday. The annual rate of price rises in the region rose to 3.4 per cent from 2.7 per cent in July. The increase broke a four-month run of steady decline. However, inflation in Baden-Wurttemberg was unchanged at 3.2 per cent. The most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia recently reported a slight move upwards to 3.4 per cent after 3.3 per cent in July.</p>

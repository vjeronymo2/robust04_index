			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ENCINITAS PARKS  </P> <P> On Sept. 30, I participated in a focus group, costing the taxpayers $35,000,  concerning the $25-million Proposition A bond issue for Encinitas parks, to be  voted on Nov. 7.  </P> <P> Those running the study group gave us very little information on where or how  our money would be spent, but seemed anxious to elicit our approval of the bond  issue.  </P> <P> According to our hosts, 150 acres are to be acquired for parks in Encinitas.  These 150 acres are all to be developed, though to what extent they could be  after land acquisition was paid for was not made clear.  </P> <P> "Improvements" to the recreational facilities of six elementary schools are  also scheduled. I question the use of park money to improve school facilities  when the schools have their own budgets. Of course, if such expansion and  improvements were so that school parks would have an after-school life, in lieu  of the other park development in the bond issue, it would cost less, probably  not require an expensive bond issue and make more sense.  </P> <P> Furthermore, no demographic or other studies were produced to show the  projected use of these parks. Meanwhile, residents of areas such as Village  Park, where parks were included as part of the land development, would be  expected to pay again for parks in other areas.  </P> <P> The city government has embarked on a program to expand the city government.  More money seems to be spent on surveys than on real action, while the city  government has grown from 10 employees to 110 employees in the short time since  incorporation. We residents are being saddled with a new layer of government  bureaucracy that has a life of its own. This was foreseen before incorporation  by many of us. It is now coming true.  </P> <P> ROBERT PFEIL  </P> <P> Encinitas  </P></p>

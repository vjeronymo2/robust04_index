			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Clarke pledges review of funding for industry MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor, last night announced a review of the role of financial institutions in funding industry, in particular small businesses. The review, to be carried out by Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, will focus on whether business has access to the funds it needs. The chancellor told the annual dinner of the Confederation of British Industry in Glasgow that he was concerned to ensure that the City and other financial institutions contributed fully to the development of commerce and industry. The review is the first fruit of Mr Clarke's speech at the Mansion House in June, in which he committed the Treasury to listen more to the concerns of business. It also reflects the government's desire to ensure that the needs of industry are at the forefront of policy-making. The chancellor also announced measures to push forward the government's private finance initiative, launched last year to attract private capital for public-sector projects. A task force representing the public and private sectors is to be formed to identify suitable projects and willing investors. The initiative has attracted criticism for the lack of progress since it was announced in the Autumn Statement. Many companies are reluctant to commit resources to devising schemes to build new infrastructure, since they might not win a contract when it goes out to tender. Mr Nelson's review of funding for industry will aim to identify 'whether there are any market imperfections which may distort the flows of finance', according to the chancellor. Among the issues to be reviewed will be the reliance of small and medium-sized companies on bank overdrafts, which provide less flexibility than types of finance available to businesses in other European countries. Mr Nelson will also listen to complaints of 'short-termism' among institutional investors, which refuse to adopt a long-term perspective in funding growing businesses. He will be keen to establish whether the market is failing to provide finance to businesses with good investment potential. The economic secretary is not expected to produce a report, the Treasury said last night. However, it said that if problems are identified, the government will take action to rectify them.</p>

No, the problem is not the aging of  nursery-school chicken-pox, but that the ``contingent behind  barbed wire'' has gotten younger. This didn't happen overnight,  by the way. It was not just yesterday that the juvenile  detention and distribution centers were created, where police  stand guard over youngsters from 3 to 18 years old behind high  walls and barbed wire. This is simply the sign of our troubled,  unhappy times, when gunfire is heard on your own street, when  your father is taken hostage, when a youngster is tempted with  lots of money, and an 8-year-old girl is made to lie down for  sex--these days, life is increasingly more strained in juvenile  detention centers, and the stories of their lodgers are becoming  ever more bitter.    In the one I visited, young Muscovites, their neighbors from  the capital's oblast, and youngsters from adjacent countries are  serving their standard 30-day sentences. Up to 50 young  runaways, criminals and prostitutes are delivered daily. Here  they undergo a unique kind of sorting: Some are returned home,  while others are sent to correction facilities when their guilt  is established.    What typifies this unfortunate contingent today? First of  all, its rising numbers. In previous years the number brought in  daily was half of what it is now. If the flow doesn't lessen,  the center workers assert that it will be impossible to deal  with it. All the more so because the children's collective has  to undergo quarantine. There are those with chicken-pox, as  mentioned above, those with German measles, and those with  hepatitis. No quarantine is imposed here on venereal diseases.  Practically one out of every two young boys or girls has  gonorrhea. They ``love'' this disease, and they try to catch it  on purpose, so that while en route to the venereal disease  hospital many of them could escape from the ambulances. They  also flee from the hospital--it isn't kept under guard, after  all.    Who are these children, these inhabitants of the juvenile  detention center, these unfortunate youngsters, our hope for the  future, lousy and plagued by scabies, brought in from train  stations, and caught in basements and attics?    The main group, from 7 to 11 years of age, consists of  ``travelers.'' There are children from 3 to 18 years of age who  have left home for various reasons. An unsettled home life,  perpetual drunkenness of parents, and now more rarely a child's  longing to see the world, compel the children to abandon the  hearth and set off on a distant journey of tens and even  hundreds of kilometers, without money or clothing. They travel  chiefly in trains, on baggage shelves or in vestibules. As they  travel their long road, people give them food and money. But  when all of this ends, they begin to steal. In train stations  the guests to the capital come together into juvenile gangs,  which then disrobe and rob other adolescents, and sometimes even  adults, if they are drunk. Fourteen-year-old Sasha rode in from  the Urals. A man at the train station asked him: ``Do you want  to earn some money? You can sell beer.'' And so a new  ``station'' life begins. Money, lots of it. The children steal  from passers-by and divide the loot among themselves. And when  there's extra money, you can drink, and you can spend some time  with the young girls in the station--there are many of them  here, and they're cheap.    Station girls are 14-16 years old for the most part, but  recently 12-year-olds are encountered more often as well.    The station life of an adolescent doesn't last long--the  police catch the children and send them to the detention and  distribution center. Here they are bathed, deloused, fed and  sent for treatment. In 6 months the center housed 2,812 persons;  1,582 of these children were returned to their parents. To those  who hadn't had their parental rights taken away from them. To  those who could be located. In recent months many children have  been arriving from zones of conflict. It is becoming  increasingly more difficult to send them back home. Inquiries  take a long time, and often without success. The center's  associates work on the basis of personal contacts--after all,  prior to the USSR's disintegration they had worked in this  system for several years, and so old ties and acquaintances help  to solve the problems. The question is, how much longer will  this system work? In the Baltic states, in Georgia and in  Chechen, there is a unique attitude toward children from the  detention center. An Estonian or Georgian child will be picked  up quickly, while a Russian one is not, because, they say, its  parents are part of an occupying force.    The children go around here in pairs. To lunch, and for  exercise, under the escort of police. As I looked at these pairs  under convoy, I experienced pain and shame. Days go by, but the  pain and the shame do not pass.</p>

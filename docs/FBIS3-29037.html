			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kroekkrai Chiraphaet, director general of the  Business Economic Department, has commented on the first APEC  [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] Senior Officials Meeting  [SOM] -- as well as the Committee on Trade and Investment  meeting -- held in Jakarta between 31 January and 4 February.    According to him, officials placed emphasis on small and  medium enterprises, which are under the APEC umbrella. Relevant  working groups and committee were told to emphasize these  because APEC believes they will contribute to the economic  development of its members, especially regarding regional  distribution of income. Consideration, however, must be given  to enterprises that really respond to the needs of each country.    With the conclusion of the GATT talks, the APEC group  pursued  its call for liberalization within the grouping. Thailand must  plan ahead for five years from now and must adapt, because  Thailand will have to remain with APEC whether it likes it or  not.    Withun Tulayanon, the department's expert on regional trade  who also attended the Jakarta SOM, said the meeting tasked  Indonesia with preparing for an informal APEC trade ministers  meeting during the next GATT meeting, which will be held in  Morocco. This meeting will allow ministers to exchange views  prior to the next APEC meeting, which is scheduled for Seattle  [as published].    He said that during the SOM, U.S. officials circulated  copies  of a paper on work that APEC should pursue that was adopted at  APEC's Blake Island summit late last year. President Bill  Clinton signed the paper. It was handed to Indonesian President  Suharto, who will host this year's APEC meeting. The paper said  it was agreed at Blake Island that an APEC investment code  [preceding two words in English] should be drafted in 1994. The  senior officials were surprised when they read the paper.  Member countries agreed in principle at the summit to draw up  an investment code, because this will facilitate the flow of  capital within the grouping. There was no indication, however,  that the move should be carried out this year.    Withun said that such a proposal had already been made to  APEC in 1993 by the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC)  [preceding four words and acronym in English]. Under this  proposal, investing countries would be given national treatment  [preceding two words in English], which is even better than most  favored nation status (MFN). There was also a prohibition  against quotas on the use of local raw materials. The proposal  was not supported by most members, and was finally rejected.    Many countries expressed surprise after reading the paper  presented to the SOM. Many disagreed with its contents. Thai  Board of Investment officials present also disagreed. The  meeting decided that the issue should first be discussed by  investment specialists from member countries scheduled to meet  in the United States at some point. Thailand will send Board of  Investment officials to attend.    According to a Commerce Ministry source, the United States  pressed for a discussion of the investment code during the SOM.  An early resolution of this matter would benefit the United  States, particularly if it concerns the liberalization of  foreign investment in the service sector, such as airlines,  tourism, and banking.    Singapore and Hong Kong also support the move to speed up  discussion of the investment code. As duty free ports, they  both stand to benefit. Japan partially supports the move, but  has reservations concerning telecommunications. Australia  supports it. Thailand, Indonesia, China, and some other  countries disagree with it. This includes Korea, which has  never allowed foreign investment in its oil industry.    Anyway, it is possible that there was no mention in the APEC  statement about concluding the investment code this year. Those  who attended the SOM will have to report to Deputy Prime  Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak and check with him as to  whether there was any agreement at the APEC summit about a  deadline for drawing up the investment code. The deputy prime  minister attended the summit.    Withun also described the meeting of the Committee on Trade  and Investment, which is a permanent mechanism of APEC,  established under the International Charter on Trade and  Investment adopted at the 5th APEC ministerial meeting in  November 1993. The meeting agreed to speed up work on the  following three issues: 1) product origin; 2) mechanism for  settling disputes; and 3) policy on competition. APEC will  attempt to push the first two issues on the GATT meeting's  agenda. New Zealand has been asked to work on the third issue  and develop a more precise definition. New Zealand made the  proposal.</p>

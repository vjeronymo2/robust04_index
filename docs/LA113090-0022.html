			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> TUNESMITHS CROON THEIR OWN CREATIONS  </P> <P> On stage at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre, Allan Rich was recalling the advice he  kept getting as a struggling songwriter. "Allan, don't write ballads!" he kept  repeating like an industry mantra.  </P> <P> "You can't get 'em placed anywhere anymore!"  </P> <P> That's counsel he and most of the other writers on the bill at the fifth annual  Salute to the American Songwriter program Wednesday have ignored, and  profitably.  </P> <P> It was virtually a Salute to the Contemporary American Love Ballad, with such  adult-contemporary song factories as Rich ("I Don't Have the Heart"), David  Foster ("Glory of Love"), Tom Snow and Barry Mann ("Don't Know Much"), Charles  Fox ("Killing Me Softly") and Jeff Silbar ("Wind Beneath My Wings") on hand to  make a stab at crooning their own creations.  </P> <P> These writers, who rarely get a chance to be on stage, were almost invariably  enjoyably hammy, and though many of them proved quite capable vocalists, the  irony inherent in the occasional top tunesmith's not being able to carry a tune  made even weaker moments diverting. Plus: Only on this occasion can one go to a  hall usually reserved for classical pieces and hear an earnest, full-band  rendition of the theme from "The Love Boat."  </P> <P> Ideological or non-love songs and singer-songwriters were under-represented.  Filling both niches was Jackson Browne, with "World in Motion" as one of his  two choices. Country's Dwight Yoakam also turned in an all-too-brief, two-song  acoustic turn, and '60s folk-rock figure P.F. Sloan ("Eve of Destruction,"  "Secret Agent") made an exceedingly rare appearance.  </P> <P> The long evening was capped after midnight with a lifetime achievement award to  -- and medley from -- Motown greats Barrett Strong and Norman Whitfield,  reunited after 20 years and joined by the full cast on "I Heard It Through the  Grapevine."

			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS  </P> <P> Wespercorp: The Irvine computer products company lost $46,000 for the third  fiscal quarter ended March 31, compared to a net loss of $97,000 for the  similar period last year.  </P> <P> Sales declined 28%, to $342,000 from $476,000. For the nine-month period, the  company posted net earnings of $2,000, contrasted with a year-earlier loss of  $292,000. Sales fell 40%, to $1.2 million from nearly $2 million. The company  said the sales decline for the nine-month period is attributed to the sale of  its Audiofile product line, lower spare parts sales to the Federal Aviation  Administration because of a supplier's delay in shipping material, and reduced  sales of some products.  </P></p>

			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Competition cuts some food prices: Leading retailers forced to respond to discounters GROWING COMPETITION from discount grocery chains is leading to lower retail food prices in many parts of the country, a survey by Verdict, the retail market research company, shows. A survey last month of 60 stores operated by 14 food retailers found that average prices for a basket of 40 items had fallen 2.2 per cent since January in discount outlets and 1.2 per cent in nearby superstores operated by leading supermarket groups. Reductions were steep in soft drinks, which fell an average 19 per cent, and frozen foods, which fell 12 per cent. The smallest decline, 2 per cent, was in dairy products. The survey, which contrasts with government figures showing a 1.9 per cent first-quarter rise in food prices, was based on the cheapest comparable products in areas where discount chains were operating. Mr Richard Hyman, managing director of Verdict, said established chains such as J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway, which had previously dismissed the competitive challenge from discounters, were being forced to respond. 'It is clear that the food retailing market is quite different from what it was only two years ago,' he said. 'This is not a flash in the pan. There are further changes to come.' Many price reductions recorded in superstores reflected the recent launch of cheap 'tertiary' brands, carrying little-known names and unsupported by advertising. Prices of most established brand leaders had not yet been cut sharply. Prices were lower last month than in January in all the outlets surveyed, except in stores operated by Asda and Tesco and by discounters Aldi, Discount Giant and Kwik Save. The difference between average prices in discount stores and superstores widened to 9.2 per cent from 7.1 per cent in January. The cheapest discount chain was the Danish-owned Netto, where prices were 16 per cent lower than in superstores. Meanwhile, another survey, by Corporate Intelligence, found that the growing concentration of retail sales in the hands of a few large store groups has been reversed in the past two years as smaller chains won back market share. According to the survey, Britain's 10 largest retailers had sales, excluding value added tax, of Pounds 42.2bn in 1991-92, Pounds 2.2bn higher than in the previous year. But their share of total sales by the country's 600 biggest retailers fell to 47.6 per cent from 48.2 per cent. This is the first fall in the aggregate market share of the top 10 groups - which account for more than a third of retail sales - since the survey was first published in 1987. Most of the fall was suffered by large groups in non-food retailing. The growth of food discounters is reflected in the rise of Kwik Save, which overtook the John Lewis Partnership and Sears to become the ninth-largest retailer in 1991-92. Food Pricing Survey.

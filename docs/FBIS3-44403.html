The projects will cover farming, water conservancy, energy,  transport, communications and raw materials, according to  provincial authorities.    To guarantee success, Shandong will introduce new measures  including tendering, ways of investment and a responsibility  system.    Last year, the province invested seven billion yuan in 36  key  projects, 16 of which have already been completed.    The newly-constructed Jinan-Qingdao highway, which links the  province's inland capital to the scenic coastal city widely  known for its beer, was the top project. The highway, of which  the construction involved investments totalling 3.1 billion  yuan, is expected to spark an economic take-off for the areas  along the expressway.    Local experts estimate that the highway will bring about  additional profits of more than five billion yuan every year.</p>

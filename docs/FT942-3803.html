			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / International Company News: Court ruling hits Baby Bell competitors Shares in several upstart North American telephone companies fell sharply late on Friday after a court overturned new regulations meant to help them compete against the established Baby Bell US local telephone monopolies. The Bell companies hailed the ruling as a significant victory. A federal appeals court in Washington overturned a 1992 ruling by the Federal Communications Commission, the government agency which oversees the telephone industry, which required local monopolies to set aside space in their central offices for competitors to place equipment allowing them to inter-connect lines with the monopolies' networks. The Bell companies say such 'physical co-location' of equipment is not necessary to promote competition and prefer to have 'virtual co-location', with competitors' lines connected from locations near, but outside, their central offices. The court said the FCC had overstepped its legal authority and ordered it to re-examine its decision. The ruling is not expected to prevent competition coming to the local telephone market, but it could slow its progress. The uncertainty created by the court's ruling could make state telecommunications regulators more wary about forcefully backing new rivals to the Bells. Shares hit by the ruling included Omaha-based MFS Communications, which serves corporate customers in more than a dozen cities and fell Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 24 7/8 at Friday's close.</p>

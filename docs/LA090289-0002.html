			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FILE  </P> <P> Archbishop Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles will celebrate the 43rd annual  Catholic observance of Labor Day in a Mass Sunday at St. Vibiana's Cathedral,  but he will skip the annual Southern California Labor Institute breakfast  co-sponsored by the archdiocese the next day at the Biltmore Hotel.  </P> <P> The two events were separated this year in the midst of a bitter fight between  organized labor and the archdiocese as Mahony challenged union organizing of  workers at the church's 10 cemeteries.  </P> <P> Mahony, in a recent statement, asserted that he wants to maintain "a close  relationship . . . with organized labor" but added that recent breakfasts have  put him in difficult positions.  </P> <P> At the 1986 breakfast, Mahony said Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) spoke "most  favorably" for the right to abortion. "I was stunned," Mahony said. Last year's  breakfast "could accurately be described as a 'pro-Dukakis, anti-Bush'  political event," he said. While the archbishop said he understood that labor  leaders support candidates with similar views, Mahony said his presence could  have wrongly signaled that he backed particular candidates.  </P> <P> It was reported earlier that Mahony privately blasted the 1988 Labor Day event  as "a travesty" and the sponsoring institute as "hostile" and "anti-Catholic"  in a letter to Patrick W. Henning, the institute's executive director.  </P> <P> The Catholic Labor Day Mass once was the highlight of the yearly observance,  followed by informal coffee and doughnuts, according to a church spokesman. But  in recent years the breakfast has attracted as many as 1,500 people while the  Mass preceding it drew no more than 50 people. Mahony said not only labor  leaders but also union members and their families have been invited to the  10:30 a.m. Sunday Mass.  </P> <P> CONFERENCE  </P> <P> The first U.S. committee meeting for the World Council of Churches' Ecumenical  Decade of Churches in Solidarity with Women (1989-1999) will be held Friday and  Saturday by the First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles. After  a Thursday evening worship service at the University Hilton, the planning  sessions will feature seminars and an ecumenical service 7:30 p.m. Friday with  a sermon by Joan SalmonCampbell, moderator of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).  </P> <P> DATE  </P> <P> Gayraud Stephen Wilmore, who teaches church history at the Interdenominational  Theological Center in Atlanta, will speak on "Radicalization and Resistance in  Contemporary African-American Religion," at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday at the School of  Theology at Claremont. The Earl Cranston Memorial Lecture, free to the public,  will be in the Mudd Theater.  </P> <P> MEDIA  </P> <P> Not long before she died on June 26, Trude Weiss-Rosmarin, founder of the  53-year-old Jewish Spectator magazine, turned over the editorship to Robert  Bleiweiss and his Calabasas-based American Friends of the Center for Jewish  Living and Values. "He is a remarkably knowledgeable trans-sectarian Jew  totally committed to the sustenance of Jewish values for this and subsequent  generations," wrote Weiss-Rosmarin in the recent combined Spring-Summer issue.  The eclectic, intellectual quarterly has a national circulation of fewer than  1,500, but its contributors include well-known figures. Deborah Lipstadt,  professor of modern Jewish history at Occidental College, chairs the new  editorial board.  </P> <P> The Jewish Television Network, carried by five Los Angeles cable systems, has  "struggled and suffered from a lack of funds" for the eight years of its  existence, according to Jay Sanderson, executive director. But now, with newly  developed financial support, Sanderson said, the Los Angeles-based, nonprofit  network will launch a new format on Sept. 17. The added programs will include a  19-part documentary from Israel Broadcasting on the founding of the Jewish  state. JOHN DART  </P></p>

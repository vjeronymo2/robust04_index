			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Claudia Moreira in Brasilia] </F>   [Text] Following the end of the racist regime, the  Brazilian Government expects to increase trade relations with  the Republic of South Africa [RSA]. Before the consolidation of  the democratic government of Nelson Mandela, relations between  Brazil and the RSA were not very good because the Brazilian  Government opposed the racist apartheid regime. Now that it is  gone, it is expected that trade relations between the two  countries will triple in the next five years. This was reported  by Foreign Minister Celso Amorim:    [Begin Amorim recording] Without doubt, our trade potential  with the RSA is very big. This potential was repressed on  account of the sanctions against the RSA and our own opposition  to the apartheid regime. Now, with a majority government and a  fully democratic government elected by the people's votes, our  expectations have improved enormously, mainly because the RSA's  economy will undergo important transformations that probably  will open new business opportunities. [end recording]    The Brazilian Government has invited RSA President Nelson  Mandela to visit Brazil this year. The RSA Government however,  has yet not officially confirmed Mandela's visit to Brazil.</p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: First Technology doubles to Pounds 1.8m Recovery in the US helped to increase interim profits at First Technology, which makes crash dummies and safety sensors for the car industry. Pre-tax profits more than doubled, from Pounds 807,000 to Pounds 1.76m, in the six months to October 31, while sales rose by 42 per cent to Pounds 16.1m. Mr Fred Westlake, executive chairman, said the improvement in trading had prompted the board to pay an interim dividend of 1p. The group, which restructured its balance sheet last year after extensive disposals, did not make an interim payment last time. The shares, which plunged from 500p in 1990 to 20p within 18 months, yesterday rose by 14p to 292p. Mr Westlake said the group's automotive electronics business had experienced strengthening demand in both its main markets of the US and Europe. In North America, new car sales were higher, while in Europe the turnover increase was due more to gaining new customers such as Honda and Fiat. Mr Westlake said consumer awareness of safety issues was increasing, as manufacturers advertised features such as the group's fuel cut-off device. A kit to enable the device to be fitted to existing cars would soon be on sale throughout Europe. First Technology said two European motor manufacturers had ordered its recently launched crash-activated seat belt unit, which uses a sensor to tighten seat belts on impact. The US-based automotive safety operation, which makes crash dummies, had a satisfactory six months with both sales and profits up to expectations. Mr Westlake said: 'Sales to Japan were marginally lower than for the comparable period last year, reflecting the economic downturn in Japan. However, this shortfall was compensated by increased sales to South Korea. Indeed, South Korea is expected to become an important market as its car industry increases in importance.' Earnings per share increased by 75 per cent from 4.2p to 7.36p.</p>

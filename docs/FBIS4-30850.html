			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by P.W.R.: "Coalition Has a `Strategy for Poland'"] </F>   [Text] The government of the coalition of the Democratic  Left Alliance and the Polish Peasant Party has worked out a  "Strategy for Poland." It is a plan which, according to Deputy  Prime Minister Grzegorz Kolodko, can result in an increase of  the GDP by as much as 22 percent within four years. The real  consumption is supposed to increase by more than 10 percent, as  is the number of work places. The plan is to be discussed at the  next session of the Council of Ministers. Next week it is to be  debated in the Sejm. The deputy prime minister also stated that  "today there is neither a possibility nor a necessity" for  amending the budget. The deputy prime minister announced all  this at the Third Congress of the All-Polish Trade Union  Agreement and received a thunderous ovation.  <H5>  What the Plan Contains </H5>   According to Kolodko, the new government plan includes all  Poles, even though this does not mean that everyone will be  happy. He added that it is the human being, not the money, that  is the central point of the new strategy.    The plan envisions a processes of deregulation,  decentralization, denationalization, and lessening the  participation of the state in the economic life, said Kolodko.    The strategy for Poland consists of a key program whose  theses put the main emphasis on the following: Lowering the  social costs of reforms, creating a strategic concept (rapid  economic development, systemic and economic stabilization,  improvement of living conditions for the people). These theses  are broken down into 10 main programs:    1. Shaping of modern work relations and regulation of  remuneration.2. Reform of the system of social  insurances.3. Combating unemployment.4. Development of  rural areas.5. Investment in human capital.6.  Improvement of the efficiency of the management of state-owned  property; ownership transformations.7. Development and  reform of the financial sector.8. A medium-term financial  strategy.9. Security of the economic exchange and absorption  of the gray market.10. Competitiveness of the Polish economy  in foreign markets.    These programs are then divided into more specific and  detailed programs; the ideas of previous governments were also  taken advantage of in the preparation of these programs.    The deputy prime minister explained that everyone will be  able to benefit from the reform of the social insurances;  however, this will be possible only after "more than ten years."  He gave assurances that "the government will carry out a policy  as a result of which unemployment will be dropping." He  promised that "in the long run, investment in human capital  (education, science, culture, health protection) is looked upon  by the government as one of the springboards of development; it  wants the share of the budget expenditure for these four areas  to increase." He stated that the economic sectors will be  treated equally and that the areas of state-owned property will  be separated. According to him, the inflow of foreign capital  is to be treated as an instrument for improving the Polish  economy.    The strategy for Poland proposes a solution, whereby in the  regions that are particularly threatened by unemployment the  time of work should be shortened: more people would have jobs,  but naturally the salaries would have to be smaller.  <H5>  What the Plan Will Yield </H5>   According to Kolodko, the "Strategy for Poland" will result  in an increase in the GDP "perhaps even" by as much as 22  percent within four years. It is also to be expected that real  consumption will increase by more than ten percent; this  increase should not omit any social groups. It will create new  work places; the strategy will also result in economic and  systemic stabilization.    "The coalition government proposes a strategy for Poland. It  is our option which the people will or will not accept. We do  not claim that there are no other options; however, we do claim  that this one is the best."    Kolodko called the strategy for Poland "the result of four  trends": social listening ("we are listening to what the people  are saying"), economic professionalism ("we will only promise  solutions that are possible to implement, because this coalition  will give such promises as were given by some of the previous  governments"), pragmatism, and conciliation ("we are proposing a  program that all Poles can reach agreement over").  <H5>  Revision of Budget Not Very Likely </H5>   The deputy prime minister said that there is no additional  money in the budget, although he conceded that receipts are a  little higher than expected.    "A revision of the budget will be made this year, if there  is  such a possibility and necessity. Today there is neither such a  possibility nor necessity. If such a possibility appears, the  shifts will be minimal. I will ask trade unions for advice as  to how these several trillion zlotys, if they appear, should be  spent."</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / International Company News: Petrocon declares final its offer for James Wilkes - Bidder attacks target's policy of selling core businesses PETROCON, the engineering and surveying group, yesterday declared final its bid for James Wilkes, the Sheffield-based engineering company, and launched a scathing attack on the Wilkes defence. The attack came in Petrocon's offer document which shareholders should receive shortly. Petrocon's bid, a straight share exchange of 13 Petrocon shares for every three Wilkes shares, was launched on February 3 and at last Friday's closing prices, valued Wilkes at about Pounds 28m. The offer closes on March 30. Petrocon said it had the support of 35.4 per cent of Wilkes shares, comprising accept- ances of 13 per cent, a commitment to accept the bid from holders of a further 17.6 per cent, and a further 4.8 per cent owned by Petrocon and its associates. The offer document con- centrates on Petrocon's cash resources and net assets, which it claims will support Wilkes' 'overgeared and hard pressed balance sheet,' and Petrocon's strong man- agement team and specifically attacks Wilkes' policy of selling its core busi- nesses. It also points out that links remain between Mr Arthur Watt, the new chairman of Wilkes, and Mr Stephen Hinchcliffe, the former chairman who resigned after the Petrocon bid. The document also hits out at Mr Watt's record as a director and latterly as managing director at Aurora, the engineering group, for five years until 1983. Petrocon said Mr Watt left Aurora in 1983 prior to a financial reconstruction of the company; 'Wilkes' shareholders should not let Aurora's fate befall their company,' said Petrocon. Petrocon rejected Wilkes' criticism of its management team, pointing to its successes in revitalising and improving performances at other engineering businesses, including successful research and development projects at Cape Industries and Floform. It also highlighted the management team's performance at Central &amp; Sheerwood where operating losses of Pounds 1.4m in 1986 were transformed into operating profits of Pounds 787,000 in 1988. Wilkes' strategy of selling many of its non-core businesses is described by Petrocon as 'an admission of failure,' and Petrocon also points out that Mr Watt shares common directorships with Mr Hinchcliffe, Wilkes' former chairman.</p>

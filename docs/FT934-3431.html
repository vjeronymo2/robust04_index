			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Japan machine tool orders fall to a record low Japanese machine tool orders in October fell 22.2 per cent from a year earlier and were the lowest for a single month since the Japan Machine Tool Builders' Association began collecting sales statistics a decade ago, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo. The sharp fall indicates the depth of capital spending cuts among Japanese manufacturers, who have deferred or cancelled expansion plans and are delaying new equipment purchases as part of cost-cutting programmes. Domestic orders slipped 29.2 per cent from a year earlier, while exports were 10.7 per cent lower.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Finns to build fifth N-plant FINLAND's centre-right government yesterday voted in favour of building a fifth nuclear power plant, ending weeks of division on the issue. The project still faces a difficult passage through parliament, with a final decision expected in May, writes Christopher Brown-Humes. The plant would be built on the site of one of the existing power stations at Loviisa or Olkiluoto, with completion expected around the year 2000. The Finnish utilities, IVO, TVO and PEVO have already received bids from potential suppliers.</p>

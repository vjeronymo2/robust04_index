			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Food: Italy's gift to Wales - Giles MacDonogh visits Taruschios in their Welsh eyrie THE CELTS generally are not noted for their ability in the kitchen. With the possible exception of Brittany, the one region of France I do not know well, no one would travel to a Celtic region for the food. In all but a few well-charted restaurants, Ireland is a gastronomic nightmare; Scotland has a few more good tables, but this new wisdom has not filtered down to the housewife or housekeeper; and then there is Wales. Wales: leaks and laver bread, lamb (with terrible mint sauce), cockles and sewin (salmon trout), and hearty teas of bara brith, tarts and scones. One thing which all the Celtic regions have in common is access to excellent raw ingredients. Wales is no exception: the lambs graze on particularly rich, verdant pastures and the same grass provides the cream for Welsh cheeses. The coast is not just a source for cockles and laver bread - Wales also offers lobsters, crabs and oysters as well as fish. Its fertile market gardens grow good fruit and vegetables. This is how the marketing organisation, A Taste of Wales, would like us to see the principality: good local ingredients to be combined whatever way you will. Traditions largely are played down. Wales certainly has a culinary past, such as the cawl lamb stew (which turns out to be a close cousin of its Irish counterpart) or the now rare Carmarthen ham; or faggots, even. One notably Welsh practice, born of poverty, is the replacement of meat by cheese, as in Welsh rabbit (not rarebit, but an allusion to the fact that the Welshman had to content himself with a bogus bunny). Glamorgan sausages are another meatless dish. Providing you select well, you may eat well in Wales at virtually any level. On a recent visit I was introduced to Meudwen Stephens, a Breconshire farmer's wife who takes her cake-making talents all over the world to promote Welsh tourism. She rents out three rooms in her farmhouse in the Black Mountains and sends her 'guests' home well-nourished on plain Welsh cookIng. Teas and puddings clearly are what she enjoys most, and it was she who explained to me that a Welsh 'tart' was, in fact, a flattened pie - presumably a corruption of the French tourte. (Tel: 0814-711349). A local pub with decent food is the Griffin at Llyswen, in the beautiful Wye Valley (0874-754-241). I visited the Griffin at lunchtime and was able to choose from an adventurous menu which included dishes such as jugged hare for Pounds 8.50. A lack of selection when it came to Welsh beer absolved me of my responsibility to drink Welsh (why no Brains?). I had a pint of Murphy's Irish stout instead. Not far from the Griffin is the Lake Country House Hotel, in Llangammarch Wells (05912-202), owned by Pierre and Jan Mifsud. The Lake is as lovely an hotel as any I know in Britain with 50 acres of valley, stream and lake in a particularly secluded part of the countryside. The kitchen, however, could do with a mite more attention to detail. Dishes tend to be over-elaborate while sauces lack concentration. Deficiencies in the cooking are to a degree offset by the compendious wine list. It is accepted generally that the Walnut Tree Inn in Llandewi Skirrid, near Abergavenny, is the best restaurant in Wales. Given its many accolades (including being cookery writer Elizabeth David's favourite), the informality of the place comes as a surprise. It is, as its chef Franco Taruschio says, a pub; but the best sort of pub, for all that. There is a busy bar, a 'bistro' and a restaurant; but the restaurant is deeply informal and the menu is the same in all three places. Most of the clients are local, due no doubt to the enormous warmth exuded by Franco and his wife, Ann, and their success in fitting into this remote community. Franco's food is not exactly Welsh, but it does contain Welsh elements. The amuse-gueules, for example, are deep-fried laver bread, Glamorgan sausages and little fish cakes. The latter betray a slight Thai influence; a tribute, perhaps, to Ann and Franco's adopted daughter. Another Welsh dish is Lady Llanover's salt duck which is served in rare, juicy strips with damsons. Franco is happiest using Welsh ingredients to recreate the food of his native central Italy, such as his papardelle with hare sauce. It is not exactly a sauce, as the pasta comes with large chunks of hare in a sauce on top of parmigiano-reggiano. At this time of year, game plays a major role in menus at the Walnut Tree: main courses included some perfectly-cooked local venison fillet and partridge with lentils and celeriac. The portions are huge and that goes for the puddings, too. Somehow, Franco contrived to serve me three: a wonderful Christmas pudding ice (by far the best of the three I have had this year); a sticky toffee pudding; and a mince pie wrapped in thin pastry leaves. The Walnut Tree also has an exemplary wine list. It is touchingly ironic that an Italian should make Wales worth the visit. But do not expect to pay under Pounds 35 a head.</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Swedish growth of 2 per cent predicted SWEDEN is moving firmly into a recovery phase and its economy can be expected to grow by around 2 per cent next year, Mr Bengt Dennis, the central bank governor, said in a speech yesterday. Growth from 1995 onwards ought to be even higher, he stated. He said domestic demand, which has fallen sharply over the last three years, could be expected to stabilise in 1994. 'Combined with rapidly growing exports, this ought to produce a noticeable change in the development of the economy,' he added. Mr Dennis noted that short-term interest rates were at their lowest levels for 14 years and long-term interest rates back to 1974 levels. He ruled out any drastic cuts in the bank's key marginal rate, which has fallen from 12.5 per cent to 8 per cent since last year. He drew attention to the weakening of the krona and rise in long-term interest rates during recent weeks, which he said could be blamed on uncertainty over Sweden's future economic policy.</p>

Our correspondent says the delegates,  among other issues, urged the NCC to redouble its efforts to  ensure that the constitution becomes effective immediately after  the forthcoming multiparty general elections. The conference  also recommended that Malawi's traditional and moral values be  included in the constitution in such a way that they stand to  take (?their turn).    And in their speeches during the closing session, leaders  [words indistinct] representatives of the various political  parties thanked the NCC for organizing the conference. They  said the conference had rendered their parties the opportunity  to contribute their views on the draft constitution.    In his remarks, the UNDP [UN Development Program] resident  representative in Malawi, Mr. (Michael Haynes), said the  conference was a historic moment for Malawi, because it has  provided an opportunity for laying a foundation for a new  constitution for the country.</p>

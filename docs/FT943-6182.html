			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Arts: 'Rebecca' still thrills - Theatre Two birds with one stone. First I read Daphne du Maurier's novel Rebecca, which is so sensitively written that it deserves all the praise it has ever been given. Then I went to Bath, where Rebecca the play is at the Theatre Royal, which must be one of the most pleasant theatres in the country. Unsubsidised, it lives nowadays mainly on touring productions, sponsorship and making its excellent facilities available for other activities. The theatre even has its own pub, named appropriately The Garrick's Head. Du Maurier's novel was published in 1938. It was so successful that she herself produced a dramatised version, starring Margaret Rutherford as the sinister Mrs Danvers, a year later. The movie, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, came around the same time. There is no great point in comparisons. They are simply different treatments of broadly the same material and each stands in its own right. The novel is written in the first person by the second Mrs de Winter. It is more the tale of one girl's experience than of a wider society. Du Maurier did not even give her a first name. The play is more Agatha Christie than a subjective piece seen through one set of eyes. Yet the suspense is still there. Note in this production the frisson that goes through the audience as the curtain rises for the second act with Mrs Danvers in black at the top of the stairs and a frightened Mrs de Winter at the bottom: the frivolities are over. Note, too, the way some of the twists of the plot of the novel are made more dramatic by shortening. A possible motive for a verdict of suicide on Rebecca is established by a couple of telephone calls, not by a long trip from Cornwall to London. All this is done while keeping a large part of the original dialogue, though sometimes the order is changed. It is clearly what du Maurier wanted to do to her own work. There is a single set, designed by Allen Miller-Bunford, of the hall at Manderley, the remote stately home of Maxim de Winter. Since the Bath theatre is itself rather elegant, that is all that is required to convey the opulence of the house. Moreover, it is opulence without ostentation. Nothing in Hugh Wooldridge's production is crude; the lighting, so important to the plot and the nuances, never falters. The entire cast - and this is a rare compliment - seem born to the social class they have to play: masters, servants and inbetweens. In the novel Maxim seems a bit of a shadowy figure. On stage, played by Patrick Mower, he emerges as central. A consequence is that Carolyn Backhouse's Mrs de Winter falls a little into the background, yet this is entirely suitable to the drama. After all, it is not Mrs de Winter who has committed a crime, nor is she the star attraction at Manderley. Ms Backhouse accepts this slight demotion from her role in the book with great dignity. Under E&amp;B Productions Rebecca runs at Bath for the rest of this week, then has outings at Norwich, Sheffield, Nottingham, Aberdeen and a string of other regional theatres. Catch it where you can.</p>

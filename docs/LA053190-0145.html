			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> PANEL DEADLOCKS ON CONVENT PLAN  </P> <P> The Ojai Planning Commission deadlocked on Wednesday over a proposal to allow  Michael Jackson's former manager to convert a Catholic convent in downtown Ojai  into an office complex.  </P> <P> The 2-2 vote by the commission amounted to a denial of the proposal by music  promoter Frank Dileo, who once guided Jackson's career.  </P> <P> The two commissioners who opposed the project said they were concerned about  increased traffic in the residential neighborhood, where an elementary school  is located.  </P> <P> Dileo's partner, Jim Exon, said he would appeal the decision to the City  Council. Exon and Dileo want to buy the 33-year-old St. Thomas Aquinas Convent  at 214 Aliso St. from the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, which has agreed to the  sale.  </P> <P> Dileo and Exon propose to occupy some of the 5,196-square-foot building and  rent out office space to other businesses.  </P> <P> If Dileo and Exon succeed in convincing the City Council to overrule the  Planning Commission, they would change the building by rebuilding the front  walls and creating a new arched entryway, Exon said.  </P> <P> The Sisters of Bethany occupied the eight-bedroom convent from 1957 to 1985.  When they stopped teaching at nearby St. Thomas Aquinas Elementary School, all  but two of the nuns moved, said Barbara Caballero, a former nun who has been  retained by the archdiocese as caretaker of the convent.  </P> <P> Although the parish still uses the building for meetings and Friday Scripture  readings in the summer, the archdiocese put the convent on the market last year  for $550,000.

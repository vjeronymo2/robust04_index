			<p>BFN     [Text] A Syrian information source has said that the Syrian  president's talks in Cairo dealt mainly with the peace process,  which is now undergoing a veritable crisis as a result of the  lack of seriousness in the Israeli government's stands.    The source said that, in addition to Syria's criticism of  Israel, Damascus blames Washington for its stands. which  contradict peace, contrary to what was agreed on during  al-Asad-Clinton summit in Geneva last January. The Geneva  summit revived hopes for promoting the Middle East peace process  but no progress has been realized because of Israel's  intransigence and the Zionist lobby's moves in the United States  to hamper any effective and pressuring U.S. role. Syria is also  of the opinion that the Syrian-Israeli negotiations in  Washington last January and February on the level of delegation  heads ended without any results worth mentioning because  Washington did not bring pressure to bear on Israel.    Syria also blames Washington for its failure to denounce  Israel after the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, for preventing the  Security Council from adopting a resolution on this issue for  three weeks, and for the reported pledge by President Clinton to  the Zionist organizations upholding unified Jerusalem as capital  of the Hebrew state, contrary to UN Security Council Resolution  242 and the policies of the previous U.S. administrations, which  refused to recognize the annexation of Arab Jerusalem and  insisted on considering it part of the occupied territories.    Damascus is equally displeased with U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher's announcement on his readiness to visit the  region but without exercising any pressure on Israel. Moreover,  the United States insisted on keeping Syria on the list of  states that did not cooperate with it in the field of combating  drugs.    Asserting that, with all these moves, the U.S.  Administration  aims to deny Syria any Economic assistance, the Syrian  information source reiterated that his country had neither asked  nor obtained any such assistance in the past, and that it joined  the peace process hoping that Washington would fulfill its  pledges and play the role of a full, fair, and just partner.  This role has not materialized, however, into tangible results  yet, the source said.</p>

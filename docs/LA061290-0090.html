			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: GUATEMALA CITY;  </P> <P> A LATIN SUMMIT  </P> <P> After three years of diplomacy that helped end a guerrilla war in Nicaragua and  launch peace talks in El Salvador and Guatemala, Central America's presidents  will turn to an economic agenda when they meet in nearby Antigua this weekend.  </P> <P> Without joint efforts to pull the region out of a decade-old recession,  officials believe, their achievements in peacemaking and in strengthening  democracy will be fleeting.  </P> <P> Costa Rica, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua are led by conservative  presidents who have taken office within the last year. They share an interest  with host Guatemala in acting as a bloc in world trade, dealings with  creditors, and economic development.  </P></p>

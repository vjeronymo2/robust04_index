			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A prominent Israeli history professor was stabbed to death in Jerusalem, and  police said they are investigating it as a possible political or terrorist  attack. The body of Hebrew University Prof. Menachem Stern was found by  schoolchildren in a park near Israel's Parliament building, a police spokesman  said. Stern, 64, was stabbed several times in the chest, the spokesman said. He  said robbery was ruled out as a motive because a watch and money were found on  Stern's body. Asked whether terrorists were believed responsible, the spokesman  said, "This direction is also being checked." Israel Television said two Arabs  have been detained in the case. Stern, honored in Israel for academic  excellence, had also lectured at Harvard and Oxford.  </P></p>

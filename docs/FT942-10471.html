			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (13): Consultants initiate recovery - Kenya Airways may be privatised within the next year Eighteen months ago, privatisation of Kenya Airways would have been dismissed as sheer fantasy, but with the airline turning in a profit in the year to March 1994, a sell-off this year or next is on the cards. The remarkable turnround at Kenya Airways is reassuring evidence that parastatal reform is not as elusive as most African experience might suggest. In 1991, the government appointed a new board, charged with commercialising the airline that had accumulated losses to March 1993 of some Ks6.2bn (Dollars 110m). Two years ago, the board appointed Speedwing Consultants, the independent consultancy arm of British Airways, to advise how the airline should be commercialised and prepared for privatisation. Speedwing produced a hard-hitting report which recommended that the airline be run on strictly commercial lines. This would mean eliminating political interference, sweeping management changes, a major overhaul of the commercial division with a new focus on customer service, and tight financial controls. The report was accepted, and three highly experienced airline executives, who had worked for small, low-cost airlines in the UK, were appointed on three-year contracts as chief executive, and to head the commercial and finance divisions. The new management team has stuck closely to the consultants' report. In classic turnround mould, top management was restructured, with political appointees being replaced by professionals. Eleven managers were retrenched and about 9 per cent of the workforce allowed, or encouraged, to take early retirement. Conscious of the need to develop a customer-first culture, in the course of a month the entire workforce of some 2 700 people was put through a day-long course, 'Putting People First'. The new team targeted foreign exchange costs, concluding that it could provide 90 per cent of the required services with just 60 per cent of the existing aircraft capacity. Accordingly, one leased aircraft was returned to the lessors at a saving of some Dollars 18m over five years. Other hard-currency costs were pared to the point where, today, the airline's foreign currency earnings exceed forex costs. Management found it could provide 110 per cent of previous volumes with 60 per cent of aircraft capacity. This was achieved by a combination of volume growth and increased market share - not higher fares in international markets. In the domestic market, devaluation and rapid inflation forced the airline to double fares over the past year; domestic services are now breaking even, while foreign routes are profitable. In the year to March 1994, Kenya Airways exceeded its break-even target, earning a surplus of Ks450m. 'We were able to send the minister of finance a cheque for Ks280m, becoming the first parastatal to give money back to the government,' says chief executive Brian Davies proudly. Profitability is not everything; Kenya Airways is also giving customers a far better service. Management set a target of 80 per cent of departures leaving within 15 minutes of schedule, achieving an average of 75 per cent in 1993-4, compared with less than half previously. 'Indeed,' says Mr Davies, 'some weren't departing at all]' A recent travel survey named the airline as runner-up (with BA) to South African Airways as the best carrier to Africa. With the airline in the black, the next step is privatisation. Mr Davies says this could be done by the end of 1994, in line with the programme agreed with the IMF and the World Bank. For this to happen, the government will need to clear up the balance sheet by writing off over Ks4.5bn of debt. While no firm plans have been settled yet, the likelihood is that the government will hold on to a significant minority stake, drawing a major European airline into a coalition, also with a sizeable minority holding. The rest of the equity could be placed among Kenyan institutions; the airline staff, through an employee share ownership scheme; and a share issue on the Nairobi Stock Exchange. That would ensure that well over half the equity was held in Kenya.</p>

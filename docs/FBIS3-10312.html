			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ruben Pino] </F>   [Text] On the evening of 5 March, Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina departed on a trip to Indonesia. Robaina is accompanied  by an official delegation from the Foreign Ministry [Minrex].    Robaina told journalists at Jose Marti International Airport  that the trip will include seven Asian countries: Indonesia,  Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia, India, Myanmar [Burma], and Vietnam.  Robaina is seeking to spread the truth about the Cuban project.    [Begin recording] [Pino] What are Minrex's expectations from  these meetings?    [Robaina] I believe the expectations are part of everything  that has been done, I do not want to say in the last year,  rather in the past. Nowadays we live at a faster tempo and thus  we need to explain more energetically what we are doing and to  keep abreast of what is happening in the world. I believe that  Asia is no exception in this diplomatic offensive. I plan to  listen to many opinions. I believe that there is much to learn  from this part of the world and much to contribute. This is the  main goal of the trip. [end recording]</p>

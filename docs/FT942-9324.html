			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Sumatran town lives in thrall to gangsters: Military-licensed rackets At first glance, it is hard to see why the plantation managers, traders and factory owners who make Medan their home keep confiding to visitors that the place is a throwback to the Wild West, 'a bit of a cowboy town'. Busy and polluted, with its uneasy mix of Dutch colonial architecture, Chinese shop houses and new shopping malls of concrete and glass, the largest city in the Indonesian island of Sumatra looks like a typical product of Asia's industrial revolution. There is nothing very unusual about the illegal brothels, the fights in bars, or the policemen who stop cars outside the town, accept Rp500 bribes (about 25 US cents), and wave the cars on without even a pretence of looking at the drivers' documents. What is special about Medan, according to residents, is the size and strength of the gangs running the town's protection rackets. Foreigners rarely come into contact with the gangs because their main targets for extortion are the ethnic Chinese businessmen who control most of the town's commerce and industry. Yet the two largest gangs are believed to have hundreds of members, are unofficially licensed by factions in the army (the dominant force in Indonesian politics), and are implicated in almost every significant event that occurs in Medan. Recently, for example, gangsters took sides in a violent dispute between members of the wealthy Pardede family over the management of the Danau Toba, Medan's largest hotel. People trying to play tennis on the hotel courts were startled to see groups of men fighting in the car park; one of the Pardedes, a family of indigenous Bataks, was stabbed in the lobby and the hotel was closed pending resolution of the dispute. The gangs are also accused by ethnic Chinese businessmen and trade unionists of acting as agents provocateurs during the April workers' demonstrations in support of higher pay. The demonstrations degenerated into anti-Chinese rioting; one Chinese factory owner was killed. Mr Muchtar Pakpahan, leader of the Indonesian Welfare Labour Union, says he has evidence the gang members were paid to cause trouble in Medan to discredit the independent trade union movement. Mr Pakpahan, who is from Medan, calls the gang members 'gangsters like the Mafia in Sicily'. The bread-and-butter business of the gangs is protection - threatening violence against a business or a person and taking money in exchange for not carrying out the threat. 'They make their money really by hassling downtown merchants,' says one foreign resident of Medan. It is alleged that officials tolerate, even encourage, the practice, which is seen as a form of informal taxation by the locals of the rich ethnic Chinese minority. 'It's a way of getting money off the Chinese,' says one Indonesian. 'It's easier to pay a gang than the military.' The two largest gangs operating in Medan are Ikatan Pemuda Karya (Association of Working Youth) and Pemuda Pancasila (Pancasila Youth) - Pancasila is the official state philosophy of humanism, nationalism and belief in God. 'Pemuda Pancasila is a nationwide organisation,' says one Medan resident, 'but in northern Sumatra it has long had a history of doing dirty work for the military in return for being given a free hand in illegal activities such as gambling and prostitution.' The IPK was established in the 1980s as a counterweight to the PP, which the authorities feared was becoming too powerful, and now the IPK is said to have the upper hand. One of the curious features of gang leaders is that many of the locals in Sumatra believe they have magical powers. Both Mr Olo Pangabean, the Batak who heads the IPK, and Mr Azwanni Wan, a senior Acehnese figure in the PP, are regarded as magicians; rumour has it that, when Mr Azwanni Wan was beaten in captivity by a soldier, the soldier went home to find his wife inflicted with identical injuries. Life can be good for gangsters, even those who spent only a couple of years at school. 'A gang leader can live like a businessman,' says one of Mr Azwanni Wan's associates, pointing to his friend's imposing, 14-room house. 'He runs protection for more than 20 theatres and shopping centres.' Inside the house there are pictures of Mr Azwanni Wan meeting the mayor and wearing a white suit and white shoes, but the man himself is not there. Found guilty of supporting the banned Aceh separatist movement - an accusation doubtless endorsed by rival gangs - he is serving a 13-year jail sentence. His wife, Ms Rosmaini Rangkuti, a singer, makes some money in the meantime by letting out the upper rooms of the house. She says her husband lives in style in prison and could be free in four years to take full control of his business. Since being in prison, the 45-year-old Mr Azwanni Wan has started saying his Moslem prayers again after a hiatus of two decades, but his associates say he still regards four things in life as particularly important: money, friends, magic and - last but not least - powerful connections.</p>

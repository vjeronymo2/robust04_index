			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Consumer confidence in Japan shows decline HOUSEHOLD spending in Japan fell 1.8 per cent in May from a year earlier, the first decline in three months and a sign of the weakening consumer confidence that threatens to delay a recovery expected later this year. The fall in most areas of consumer spending is likely to intensify debate on income tax cuts, but the post-election confusion will make politically-sensitive decisions even more difficult, including a stimulatory package demanded by business leaders. Management and Co-ordination Agency officials said housing-related spending was 10.1 per cent lower in May, while education spending slipped 4.7 per cent and furniture and other household expenditure fell 3.9 per cent. The agency also reported that disposable income during the month was 4.7 per cent lower than a year earlier, reflecting the impact of reduced overtime and an increase in unemployment, both of which are undermining consumer confidence. There is also growing concern among government economists that the continuing political instability could prompt consumers to be even more selective in their spending in coming months. The US has asked that Japan stimulate demand to increase imports and reduce the trade surplus. An index of leading indicators compiled by the Economic Planning Agency fell to 30 per cent in May from 63.6 per cent in April, below 50 per cent, the so-called boom-bust line, for the first time in four months. The fall in the index was attributed partly to a decline in shipments of manufacturing goods, which had risen in March and April in expectation of an increase in demand that did not materialise.</p>

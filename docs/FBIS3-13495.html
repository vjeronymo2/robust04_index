Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] said in  a leaflet distributed in the Gaza Strip that the gunman who  attacked a van of orthodox Jews in New York last week was  inspired by Islamic teachings. One person was killed and three  others wounded in that attack by a 28-year old Lebanese-born  taxi driver.</p>

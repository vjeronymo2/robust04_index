			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>   [Text] Vladikavkaz April 17 TASS -- "A way to accord  between the peoples of North Ossetia and Ingushetia is hard, but  we must move towards it," North Ossetia President Akhsarbek  Galazov said. Addressing members of North Ossetia government  and parliament leaders in Vladikavkaz on Saturday, Galazov spoke  about the results of the second round of talks between the  presidents and official delegations of North Ossetia and  Ingushetia in Nalchik, capital of neighbouring Kabardino-Balkar  Republic.    Galazov said the talks were difficult and centered on the  draft agreement on the principles, measures and terms of the  implementation of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's decree  establishing the procedure for returning refugees and displaced  persons to North Ossetia and Ingushetia.    Disagreements over who should control the disputed  Prigorodny  district were the "stumbling block" at the talks. North Ossetia  claims the district is its integral part, while Ingushetia  insists that the district belongs to it because it was inhabited  by Ingushes before they were deported in 1944.    Galasov stressed that "the question of border redrawing in  the northern Caucasus must be removed from the agenda because  territorial claims may lead to a new tragedy in Russia's south."    The two republics will resume talks after April 25 when the  Federation Council, the upper house of Russia's new parliament,  holds debates on the situation in the region and ways to  stabilise it.    The North Ossetian leader noted that the sides have reached  "progress in normalising relations between the peoples of the  two republics and dispelled pessimistic forecasts that the  dialogue in Nalchik would end in a deadlock." "The leadership  of North Ossetia is ready to carry out the decree of the Russian  president," he said.</p>

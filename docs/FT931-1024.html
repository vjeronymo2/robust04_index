			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Job teasers that need working out: Current employment trends IS IT a freak or is it a trend? Since last week's surprise announcement that unemployment fell slightly last month - the first fall in nearly three years  -City economists and Whitehall officials have been trying to come up with the reason. One Department of Employment official said yesterday it was 'probably real', meaning that the jobless total would not necessarily continue falling next month but that the underlying rate of growth had started to slow. The official was supported by Mr Kevin Gardiner, an economist at S G Warburg. He pointed to supplementary evidence such as February's increase in working hours and vacancies as well as the optimistic tone of some leading private recruitment agencies. One novel explanation for the new trend, provided by a senior government economist, is 'over-sacking'. The suggestion is that many big companies have made too many staff redundant during the recession. Some of them are starting to rein in redundancy programmes or even re-hire staff. There are several possible reasons companies might be tempted to over-sack. Labour market reforms and weaker trade unions have made it easier. Some companies believe shareholders like to see big redundancy announcements and tend to mark up share prices after they are made. Also, the accounting convention which allows redundancy costs to be taken below the line, thus not depressing earnings, is soon to be revised. After June big redundancy packages will have a direct bearing on earnings, so there is an incentive to clear out people while the old system prevails. The accounting change does not help to explain why unemployment fell last month, and there is little hard evidence for the over-sacking theory, which is based mainly on the fact that there has been a much sharper fall in employment relative to output than in previous recessions. But while few companies that have over-sacked are likely to admit to it, some companies, such as British Telecom, have openly established systems for re-employing staff if it turns out that they are hit by shortages in the course of a redundancy programme. Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland Bank, has also admitted that the bank is having trouble re-establishing old-style branches because it has pensioned off too many senior branch managers. There is harder evidence that many companies have cut back on staff as far as they can go without damaging the skill-base they require when business improves. One such company is John Brown Engineers and Constructors of Portsmouth, where all 750 employees accepted a 10 per cent pay cut last month to enable the company to hold the workforce together in spite of a shortage of orders. Mr David Rossington, chief executive of Lincolnshire Training and Enterprise Council, says that many big companies in his area have cut to the bone and will have to start recruiting at the slightest upturn. Mr John Fosdyke, chief executive of Kent Tec, also expresses 'guarded optimism' that the employment outlook might be turning. Some government economists argue that the labour market reforms of the 1980s, which made it easier for companies to fire in the recession, will also make it more attractive to hire at the first sign of upturn. But for every employment optimist there is still at least one pessimist and the the Engineering Employers Federation has revised upwards its latest job losses estimate for the engineering industry.</p>

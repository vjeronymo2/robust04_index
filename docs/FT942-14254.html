			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Hopes rise, but no room for complacency - Although exporters are more optimistic about future prospects, writes Andrew Baxter, the widening trade deficit in the first three months of this year is a worrying trend After three years of recession that has touched most sectors of industry and commerce, today 165 British companies, at least, have something to crow about. The companies are the winners of the 1994 Queen's Awards for export, technological and environmental achievement and the latest awards take to 3,506 the number of winners since the scheme was inaugurated in 1966. The export achievements come against a background of rising optimism about prospects in export markets such as North America, which has been out of recession for the past year, and long-term growth opportunities in Asia - which many of the winners have been exploiting successfully. This is offset by continuing depressed conditions in continental Europe, which for many companies is the biggest export market. The awards for technology and environmental achievement, meanwhile, underline the continuing relevance of maintaining investment in research and development - whatever the current market conditions - to ensure that British companies have the products to exploit the opportunities in the global marketplace. This year's awards come as the importance of manufacturing's contribution to national wealth seems to be better understood in government than it was, say, five years ago. Exporters, too, are generally much more positive about the help received from the government than they were two or three years ago. The most recent trade figures, showing a sharp fall in the January visible deficit from Pounds 1.57bn in December to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 916m, was immediately welcomed by Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, as 'a very encouraging start to the year'. But there is little room for complacency with a visible trade deficit of Pounds 13.4bn both last year and in 1992. In the three months to January, total exports fell 3 per cent compared with the previous three months, the trade gap widened and analysts said the trend was still worrying. Significantly, perhaps, 20 per cent of the export awards were given to companies in the 'invisibles' sector. The state of export markets for manufacturers, meanwhile, was highlighted this week in a report from the Engineering Employers' Federation, which covers industries from computers to machine tools and motor vehicles. This showed that the devaluation of the pound in autumn 1992 has boosted UK manufacturers' competitiveness and market share, albeit unevenly against different national competitors, but underlined the sharp differences in outlook in different export markets. While the US economy is growing strongly, the Japanese economy is still weak, while continental Europe, which accounts for 60 per cent of UK trade in engineering products, is forecast to make only a slow recovery this year. From the point of view of the trade deficit, this makes it all the more important that UK companies can continue to succeed on the continent. With the UK out of recession but its principal market still in it, a surge in consumer spending at home could further increase the deficit. The EEF believes engineering exports will rise by about 6 per cent in the 18 months from the second half of 1993 to the first half of 1995 as European markets begin to recover, and says automotive and electronic products will do particularly well. But imports are forecast to rise by 10 per cent. The difficulties in European export markets would appear, at first glance, to explain why the total number of applications for awards dropped this year from 1,822 in 1993 to 1,682. Companies, after all, do have to demonstrate a 'substantial and sustained increase in export earnings to a level which is outstanding for the products and services concerned, and for the size of the applicant unit's operations'. In fact, the drop can be explained mainly by a sharp fall-off in the number of applicants for environmental awards, perhaps inevitable given that 1993 was the first year and only 12 out of 240 applicants struck gold. This year, just eight out of 133 applicants proved successful. In contrast applications in the export category actually rose from 1,230 in 1993 to 1,246, while technology applications slipped from 352 to 303. Recession in Europe may have offset the competitive edge offered to UK exporters by the weaker pound, but it is not the only difficulty they face. It has emerged in the past few days, for instance, that the government has been tightening export regulations, possibly pre-empting some of the recommendations of the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry. In a move that particularly affects machine tools builders, the Department of Trade and Industry has briefed companies in recent weeks on the new regulations, which mainly involve applications for licences on potentially defence-related dual use goods. A further challenge, linked partly to the latest and previous UK recession, is the question of how to react to permanent decline in the domestic markets that often provide a base for export success. The strength and reliability of the home market has, after all, been the cornerstone of much of Japanese industry's export achievement - coupled, of course, with its relative impenetrability for would-be importers. Two examples linked to the coal industry show the importance of responding promptly when the home market for a product is undergoing fundamental change, or simply disappearing. Among the technology award winners, Leicestershire-based Dunn Systems faced the need to adapt and innovate because of the decline of its business selling conveyor systems to the coal industry. Badly mauled by the 1984/85 miners' strike, it has hit back with the high-speed Wagtail pack orientation system for the food and drink industries. From the export award winners, Motherwell-based Anderson Group, which produces mining equipment, has more than doubled exports in the past two years, reflecting its success in replacing a declining home market with new business overseas. The traditional base of export markets has also been augmented by success in new countries. A further challenge in export markets is to rise above controversy. Export award winner McKey Food Service, based in Milton Keynes, supplies frozen beef hamburgers to McDonald's. In spite of adverse publicity for British beef because of BSE disease, the company doubled its exports between 1989 and 1992. The export awards represent a wide range of industrial sectors, though four have done particularly well: pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, electrical and transport. The technology awards represented 10 industrial sectors, while the environment awards represented seven. Although the awards are for UK companies, 19 per cent of the winners had foreign associations of some kind. about the same as last year. The breakdown was as follows: 20 per cent of the export award winners had foreign associations, 17 per cent of the technology winners and 12 per cent of the environment winners. Overall, the awards show the continuing vitality of smaller companies. Companies with fewer than 50 employees scooped up 24 per cent of all awards, although their performance varied considerably in the three sectors. In the export section they won 26 per cent of the awards, compared with 6 per cent in technology and 20 per cent in the environmental section. The largest winning company is Swiss-owned Nestle UK with 20,000 employees and the smallest winners are Mondbury, a London-based maker of dresses and skirts for the 'mature woman', and Tritech International, Aberdeen-based producer of subsea electronics and robotics, with six employees each.

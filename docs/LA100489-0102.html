			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RANCHERS SWITCH TO RAISING OSTRICHES, DEER AND BUFFALO  </P> <P> The entrepreneurial spirit thrives in the U.S. livestock industry, with farmers  and ranchers raising new and exotic livestock.  </P> <P> In Minnesota, domesticated deer are raised in a feedlot where cattle were once  fed, and ostriches roam on a Texas ranch next to quarter horses and  Thoroughbreds.  </P> <P> "The ostrich industry is over 100 years old, but not in the United States,"  said Cooper Campbell, who started raising the birds on his Odessa, Tex., horse  ranch three years ago.  </P> <P> Campbell expects in four to six years that there will be enough commercially  raised ostriches to sustain markets for the meat, feathers and hide. Until  then, the best market will be for breeding stock.  </P> <P> Newborn and young ostriches are expensive, costing $6,000 for a pair of  3-month-old chicks and escalating to $45,000 to $75,000 for a pair of  3-year-olds, Campbell said. However, prices should drop sharply once the  industry matures and populations increase, he said.  </P> <P> A lot of economic hurdles face these fledgling livestock industries. Markets  have to be developed for the meat, hides and breeding stock, and government  standards for the meat must be established.  </P> <P> South Africa has a large commercial ostrich industry, and meat from the giant  birds is marketed throughout Africa and Europe, said Campbell, who is a  director of the American Ostrich Assn.  </P> <P> "It is a lean, red meat that more closely resembles beef than anything else,"  he said. It is low in cholesterol and fat and can be processed into steaks and  roasts.  </P> <P> Better-established in the United States is the market for ostrich hides, which  are used for jackets, boots, belts and shoes.  </P> <P> In Minnesota, Dennis Gibson's feedlots were empty for six years after he quit  the cattle-feeding business in 1981. Then in 1987 he began commercially raising  fallow deer, a domesticated Asian deer that is more disease resistant than the  white tail and mule deer indigenous to the United States.  </P> <P> His herd of 250 deer is primarily for breeding purposes, and he regularly sells  stags to other breeders.  </P> <P> "The deer are flighty but have no trouble adapting to the northern climate," he  said.  </P> <P> In five years, Gibson hopes that supplies will be sufficient to develop and  sustain marketing channels for venison. Local cattle slaughter plants presently  process the small amount of commercial venison on the market, he said.  </P> <P> The University of Minnesota extension service has supported deer farming with a  symposium and educational material. Deer farming is successful in New Zealand,  where there is a commercial herd of 700,000 head, and the industry is growing  by 30% a year, the university said.  </P> <P> "In the U.S., there isn't enough product (venison) available to establish a  market, but we take 25% of the venison New Zealand exports," said R.M. Jordan,  a University of Minnesota extension animal scientist.  </P> <P> Venison contains 3% to 4% fat, compared to 35% for high-quality beef, Gibson  said.  </P> <P> Still in its infancy is the commercial raising of native American bison,  commonly known as the American buffalo. The University of Minnesota extension  service reports about 90,000 head in the United States, of which 85% is under  private ownership.  </P> <P> Demand for bison meat has increased in some areas because of its leanness and  perceived lower cholesterol content.  </P></p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei unperturbed by Socialist premier Equities moved higher on expectations that the country's overall policies would remain unchanged in spite of the appointment of the first Socialist prime minister for 47 years, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average ended 162.93 firmer at 20,643.93, after declining to a day's low of 20,246.45 during the first half-hour of trading on index-linked selling, prompted by Wednesday's fall on the Chicago futures market. Later buying by public funds and dealers lifted the index to the sess-ion's peak of 20,684.14 in the afternoon. Worries about the new government receded as important posts such as the finance minister and the trade minister were filled by Liberal Democrats or former Liberal Democratic Party members. Investors were also encouraged by hopes that the new government would be more fiscally expansionist - the socialists have been advocating income tax cuts without a rise in consumption taxes. Meanwhile, speculation that Y440bn in public pension funds was likely to be allocated to the stock market also triggered buying. Volume amounted to 440m shares, against 315m. 'We were afraid that foreign investors would turn sellers, but they ended up net buyers, and that encouraged sentiment,' said one Japanese broker. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 6.70 to 1,673.32, while the Nikkei 300 put on 1.16 at 304.62. Advances led falls by 626 to 381, with 169 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 1.33 to 1,358.42. High-technology issues continued to be sought, Oki Electric climbing Y14 to Y794. Companies linked to the portable telephone market theme were also strong, with Nitsuko, a telecom equipment maker, adding Y90 at Y1,530 and Ushio Y20 at Y1,170. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone moved ahead Y17,000 to Y875,000. However, DDI, a long distance telephone operator, which had surged earlier this week on the same theme, met profit-taking and retreated Y110,000 to Y9.42m, while Kyocera, its leading shareholder, shed Y80 to Y7,370. Profit-taking also depressed some large-capital stocks. Nippon Steel dipped Y9 to Y344, but Mitsubishi Heavy Industries put on Y2 at Y789 and Kawasaki Steel Y4 at Y418. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 58.63 to 23,092.26 in volume of 20.5m shares. Murata Manufacturing, the day's most active issue, fell Y50 to Y4,640, while Nintendo, the video game maker, appreciated Y90 to Y7,140. Roundup The region's markets moved on a range of individual stories. HONG KONG appeared to take the Legislative Council's approval of Governor Chris Patten's controversial proposals for political reform in its stride, said Mr Michael Franklin of James Capel. It was, however, heartened by news of a settlement of the long Sino-British dispute over Hong Kong's military sites. The Hang Seng index finished 118.10, or 1.4 per cent, higher at 8,758.41, but was off the day's best of 8,843.68. Some Japanese demand was noted, but turnover of around HKDollars 3.20bn was on the low side. Finance issues were actively traded. HSBC Holdings rose HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 84.50 and Hang Seng Bank HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 52. KUALA LUMPUR ended mixed after a further day of unexceptional trading, with some blue-chip buying linked to year-end book closures again supporting the composite index, which gained 1.47 at 1,011.58. Volume of 110m shares was inflated by 16m shares traded in Damansara Realty, which continued to be driven by rumours of an asset injection. The stock climbed to a high of MDollars 2.38 before closing 2 cents easier on the day at MDollars 2.28. TAIPEI saw outperformance in the cement sector, up 1.3 per cent, as the weighted index ended the session off 0.55 at 5,932.60. Turnover fell to TDollars 38.82bn from TDollars 41.23bn. Petrochemicals continued to be sought following recent price rises: China Petrochemical added 70 cents at TDollars 28.70 and Union Petrochemical TDollars 1.30 at TDollars 46.10. MANILA rose on a technical rebound helped by a good overnight gain in PLDT in New York. The composite index improved 14.87 to 2,746.36 in turnover of 936.2m pesos. PLDT advanced 15 pesos to 1,670 pesos after rising Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 60 1/2 in the US. Brokers commented that many investors were taking positions ahead of the listing next month of Petron, the Philippines' biggest oil refiner. SYDNEY remained firm in spite of a bigger than expected rise in building approvals and a widening of the current account deficit which triggered a sell-off in bonds. The All Ordinaries index moved forward 14.0 to 1,989.1. Turnover came to ADollars 452m. The latest economic data raised expectations that interest rates might have to be lifted in the near future. Foster's Brewing was the day's most active issue on rumours that BHP could be selling its stake to Philip Morris. Foster's ended unchanged at ADollars 1.06, Philip Morris was untraded, and BHP, which publishes its annual results today, was up 14 cents at ADollars 18.00. SINGAPORE was mixed, although the Straits Times Industrial index rose 6.50 to 2,224.91, supported by renewed demand for some recently neglected stocks. SEOUL was flat, with persistent consolidation of blue chips keeping pace with selective gains. The composite stock index eased 0.60 to 933.36. WELLINGTON was higher ahead of the budget announcement, which came after the close of trading. The NZSE-40 capital index gained 14.61 at 1,996.88 in turnover of NZDollars 41m. Telecom led the risers, firming 8 cents to NZDollars 4.53. KARACHI encountered institutional support on the first day of the new account. The KSE index moved up 3.72 to 2,333.02, but overall losers led gainers by 171 to 140. BOMBAY was depressed by selling across a broad front on the last day of the account in specified and cash shares. The BSE 30-share index finished 53.53 down at 4,086.72 in a continuation of the correction seen since the market hit a 26-month high on June 20.</p>

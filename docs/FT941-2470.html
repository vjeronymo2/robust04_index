			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / RJB set to reopen S Yorkshire pit A former British Coal pit is to be reopened by RJB Mining, in a move that is set to create 120 mining jobs. British Coal is poised to confirm today that it has reached terms for the leasing of Rossington colliery near Doncaster in South Yorkshire, which closed last April with the loss of 500 jobs, to the company. RJB has already reopened Clipstone colliery in Nottinghamshire, which was also recently closed by British Coal, and has expressed interest in a number of other deep mines. After today's formal hand-over, Mr Richard Budge, chief executive of RJB, is thought likely to double the Rossington workforce to about 250 when the pit is in full production. Up to 10 former British Coal pits could reopen under private management before the industry is privatised later this year. Betws colliery in south Wales is set to be taken over by a management buy-out team, and Mr Malcolm Edwards, the former British Coal commercial director, hopes to restart production soon at Trentham in Staffordshire and Coventry in the Midlands.

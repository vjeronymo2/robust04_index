			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Handle with care THE BOARD of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency meets in emergency session in Vienna today to decide what to do about North Korea. That country has refused access to two liquid waste facilities, identified by satellite reconnaissance, whose existence suggests a capacity for reprocessing plutonium on a larger scale than it had admitted to possessing. Meanwhile North Korea has announced its withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) - an unprecedented step, which however cannot legally have immediate effect. Under the treaty, three months' notice must be given to all other parties and to the UN Security Council, and must include a 'statement of the extraordinary events' the withdrawing state regards as having 'jeopardised its supreme interests'. The Security Council could in theory order North Korea to remain an NPT signatory and to comply with the IAEA's request, and impose sanctions if it fails to do so. The question is whether sanctions aimed at further isolating a state which has already so isolated itself would actually be effective in altering its behaviour. The track record of economic sanctions without military action is not impressive. Military action is what North Korea claims to be afraid of. It has already put itself on a 'semi-war' footing, in response to the joint US-South Korean military exercise, 'Team Spirit', which it also cites as the 'extraordinary event' justifying its withdrawal from the NPT. There is in fact nothing very extraordinary about it - such exercises have been held regularly since 1976  -but North Korea apparently regards it as a breach of an agreement reached with the south in 1991, under which it agreed to accept IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities in return for the withdrawal of US nuclear weapons, and nuclear-capable ships and aircraft, from South Korea. The US has withdrawn them, but some of the ships and aircraft taking part in Team Spirit are, or were, nuclear-capable. How likely it is that North Korea is building a nuclear weapon, and how far if so it might have got with it, are questions on which experts disagree. Only full inspection by the IAEA can settle the matter. If North Korea has a lot to hide it is hard to see why it agreed to IAEA inspections in the first place; but many aspects of that state's behaviour defy conventional ideas of reason. What is clear is that neither South Korea nor any of North Korea's other neighbours have any desire for military escalation. In 1991 and early 1992 conciliatory gestures by the US and South Korea produced the beginnings of a thaw. It may be that by staging Team Spirit the US and South Korean militaries have inadvertently upset their own governments' diplomatic strategy. If so the Security Council, before it decides to assume the worst and embark on the stony road of sanctions, should be looking for ways to get that strategy back on track.</p>

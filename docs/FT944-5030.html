			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Glaxo helps fund vaccine centre Britain's first all-round vaccine research centre, the Jenner Institute, is to be set up with joint funding from government agencies and Glaxo, the largest UK drug company. Glaxo will pay Pounds 10m to build and equip the centre alongside the Institute for Animal Health at Compton, Berkshire. The company and the government will each contribute half its estimated Pounds 60m running costs for 10 years. In return, Glaxo will have the first option to license and develop any potential products from the research, paying royalties to the Jenner Institute. Four government agencies - the Office of Science and Technology, Department of Health, Medical Research Council and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council - took the initiative to 'combat a widely perceived shortfall in British vaccine research'. Although there are pockets of specialised research in academic laboratories and small companies such as Medeva and British Biotechnology, the UK has no large vaccine research centres to match those elsewhere in Europe and North America. Officials decided to set up the centre as a model research partnership between public and private sectors, as outlined in last year's science white paper. Mr David Hunt, science minister, told the centre's launch conference in London yesterday that all UK-based pharmaceutical groups were approached but only Glaxo wanted to take part. Mr Gerald Malone, health minister, said: 'It's a great signal about the scientific promise of vaccine research that a company like Glaxo which left the field some time ago is now prepared to come back in.' The institute will carry out basic research into the way the human immune system can be harnessed to fight disease - not only viral and bacterial infections but also cancer. The sponsoring organisations hope the institute will be running in time for the 200th anniversary of the world's first recorded vaccination in May 1796 by Edward Jenner.</p>

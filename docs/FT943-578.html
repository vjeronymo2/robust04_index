			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Biggs cuts Japan, US in portfolio News that Morgan Stanley had reduced the weighting of equities in Japan, the US and Europe in its new, global model portfolio made its first impact in Tokyo trading on Tuesday, Reuter reports. However, details came too late to have an effect on Monday's Wall Street performance. Mr Barton Biggs, Morgan Stanley's global strategist, reduced the weighting of large US stocks by 2 percentage points to 11 per cent, and of small US stocks by 1 percentage point to 7 per cent. He lowered the weighting of European shares by 2 percentage points to 6 per cent and Japanese issues to 5 per cent from the previous 8 per cent. Mr Biggs said he saw the Federal Reserve in a 'tightening mode', which meant that stocks could languish at best, and at worst could be in the second leg of the bear market that began in February. 'Central banks are so obsessed with fighting the last war, the inflation war, that they choke off what could be a new era of growth by raising interest rates,' he said. Mr Biggs raised the weighting of gold to 4 per cent from 2 per cent, commenting that the charts of the various commodity indices were very bullish. 'I want to have 8 per cent in cash and 4 per cent in gold, just in case,' he added. Mr Biggs maintained the weighting of emerging markets equities and debt positions, because 'the fundamentals are steadily improving and the money flows are still staggering', he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["War Clamour Against Dialogue"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- Kim Chong-pil, chairman  of the South Korean "Democratic Liberal Party", recently showed  up at an army unit on the forefront along the Military  Demarcation Line and blared that if a war broke out he "would  fight on the front even as a private second class." And the  words "preparedness" and "resolution" came from "a meeting of  main commanders" of the puppet army.    Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today brands this as an  agitation of war against dialogue.    The analyst says:    Now the fellow countrymen in the North and the South and the  whole world are hailing the opening of the road of a peaceful  solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through  dialogue. At this moment, Kim Chong-pil and other war-thirsty  elements of South Korea drove to the forefront along the  Military Demarcation Line and incited confrontation and war.  This is an intolerable challenge to the entire compatriots and  the world peaceloving people.    Kim Chong-pil is the man who bartered away the interests of  the nation to the aggressors who had forced colonial slavery  upon the Korean people by playing the leading role in the  conclusion of the South Korea-Japan "agreement."    If the traitor Kim Chong-pil is a Korean, how could he sell  off the interests of the nation to outside forces and can seek  today a fratricidal war which would lead to national destruction.    Such bellicose elements as Kim Chong-pil must be removed, if  the war danger is to be averted on the Korean peninsula and the  reunification question be solved peacefully.    Should the South Korean war-likers persistently follow the  road of war, creating new obstacles to the dialogue, they will  only meet their destruction.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Receivers called in at Swan Hunter: More than 6,000 jobs at risk in north-east after yard loses order and takeover talks collapse RECEIVERS were called in yesterday to Swan Hunter, the Tyneside warship builder, after its loss of a vital order for a Royal Navy helicopter carrier. The company is the last shipbuilder in north-east England, once the world's biggest shipbuilding centre. Price Waterhouse, appointed as receivers for the group's UK companies, said 'lay-offs' in Swan Hunter's 2,200-strong workforce 'may be unavoidable'. About 4,000 more jobs in the north-east are estimated to depend indirectly on Swan Hunter's survival. Many are in areas such as South Tyneside, where male unemployment, according to official figures, is 28 per cent. Mr Robin Cook, Labour's shadow trade and industry secretary, described it as 'a grave blow to Tyneside'. Directors of Swan Hunter, privatised in a management buy-out in 1986, said the loss of the order to a consortium of VSEL and the Kvaerner Govan merchant ship yard was only one of several factors behind the decision. They asked Lloyds Bank to call in receivers after negotiations with 'a substantial third party' for acquisition of the company were terminated. It is understood that takeover talks by GEC were broken off when Swan failed to win the carrier order. The directors also blamed the non-payment by the Ministry of Defence of more than Pounds 20m additional costs the company says it incurred in building an auxiliary oil and supply ship, Fort George. The MoD had failed to pay the claim in spite of assurances before Christmas that it would be handled expeditiously, they said. 'This has created a significant cash deficit and inability to pay our creditors.' Against that background, the Swan Hunter Group was unable to secure any further working capital facilities. The directors called for an independent investigation into the contract decision, saying they did not accept the 'credibility' of the MoD's claim that there was a Pounds 50m difference in the bids. The four directors, Mr Ken Chapman, Mr Alex Marsh and brothers Mr Peter and Mr Roger Vaughan, refused to be interviewed about the end of their fight to keep the business afloat. The company is understood to have been unable to pay creditors for two months. Its annual turnover is about Pounds 145m. In 1991, the last year it filed accounts, it made a loss of Pounds 17.25m.

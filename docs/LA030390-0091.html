			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIVIDED PANEL PRESENTS $66-BILLION MEDICAL-CARE PLAN;  </P> <P> HEALTH: IT WOULD PROVIDE INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR ALL AMERICANS. BUT KEY  LAWMAKERS SAY IT HAS NO CHANCE TO PASS.  </P> <P> A bitterly divided congressional commission called Friday for an ambitious  $66-billion expansion of federal spending to provide health insurance coverage  for all Americans.  </P> <P> But the plan, approved by an 8-7 margin, failed to receive a single vote from  the four Republican legislators on the commission. And it was pronounced dead  on arrival by lawmakers who would play key roles in steering health legislation  through the House.  </P> <P> "It is wrong, outrageous and morally repugnant" for Americans to be denied  health care because they cannot afford it, Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV  (D-W.Va.), chairman of the Pepper Commission, told a news conference.  </P> <P> Other members of the commission, named for its first chairman, the late Rep.  Claude Pepper (D-Fla.), agreed with Rockefeller that the estimated 37 million  Americans who currently lack health insurance must be given access to  affordable health care.  </P> <P> But they split over the contentious issue of financing, with the panel's  Republican members and one Democrat objecting to the program's huge price tag  and the absence of a specific plan for raising the money.  </P> <P> The failure to obtain bipartisan approval removes much of the potential  political momentum from the long-awaited commission report, which had been seen  as a possible vehicle for major reforms in the health care system.  </P> <P> As a result, the commission's final product will be viewed as essentially a  Democratic document. The eight-member majority included six Democratic members  of Congress and two public members picked by former President Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration is strongly opposed to any health care plan that would  require significant new spending and tax increases.  </P> <P> Despite the commission's failure to reach a bipartisan agreement, its proposal  is likely to intensify a growing national debate over the need for health care  reform.  </P> <P> The plan approved by a majority of the Pepper Commission calls for:  </P> <P>  -- Mandatory health insurance coverage for all businesses with 100 or more  workers. Companies would be given three years to offer insurance to their  employees or begin paying money into a public plan that would cover all those  without private insurance.  </P> <P>  -- Tax credits and subsidies for companies with fewer than 100 employees to  encourage them to purchase insurance for their workers. After five years, any  remaining uninsured would be covered under the public plan.  </P> <P>  -- Free coverage under the public plan for uninsured pregnant women and  children up to the age of 6 in families with income below 185% of the federal  poverty level (currently $6,314 for a single person and $12,675 for a family of  four). Other participants would pay premiums based on their income.  </P> <P>  -- Free care for the first three months spent in a nursing home, regardless of  age or income level.  </P> <P>  -- Home care and assistance, such as bathing, dressing, and grocery shopping,  for severely disabled persons.  </P> <P> Under the commission plan, the federal government would require a basic package  of medical and surgical benefits, including prenatal care, well-child exams and  preventive care, to be offered under all private and public insurance plans.  </P> <P> The yearly deductible would be $250 for a single person and $500 for a family.  Patients would pay 20% of the cost of all services, with a maximum  out-of-pocket limit of $3,000 a year.  </P> <P> Companies currently offering health insurance to their workers could maintain  their programs, but they would be required to match the new federal standards  for benefits and costs.  </P> <P> The proposed universal health program, which would expand coverage to the 37  million Americans now lacking health insurance, would cost the federal  government $66 billion a year and private businesses $20 billion, Rockefeller  said.  </P> <P> The commission plan did not discuss how the money would be raised other than  calling for a "progressive tax package, requiring a higher contribution from  those most able to bear increased tax burdens."  </P> <P> Rockefeller said the 8-7 vote for his plan was a sufficient mandate. "World  Series (games) are won by 8 to 7," he said.  </P> <P> "Well folks, we have done it," Rockefeller declared as he opened the news  conference. "(Our) recommendations will begin to transform the nature of the  American health care system (which is) . . . in total crisis."  </P> <P> But the absence of details about financing drew stinging and scornful dissents  from a key pair of commission members, Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland) and Rep.  Willis D. Gradison Jr. (R-Ohio).  </P> <P> "It's a hoax," Stark said at the news conference. "The commission is stone  silent on how they will pay for it or how much it will cost each person.  Without a way to pay for it, it is legislatively dead before it starts."  </P> <P> Gradison said $66 billion in annual expenses would cost every taxpaying  household $750. "My constituents don't feel they are under-taxed," he noted.  </P> <P> Gradison also criticized the universal nursing home benefit proposed by the  commission. "Donald Trump, God forbid, if he needed it, could spend three  months in a nursing home . . . at the expense of taxpayers," he said.  </P> <P> The Pepper Commission plan would take effect only if enacted by Congress. Stark  is the chairman and Gradison the ranking Republican on the health subcommittee  of the House Ways and Means Committee, which would handle the legislation, and  their opposition makes favorable consideration appear unlikely.  </P> <P> Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), chairman of the parent committee, also  summarily rejected the plan, issuing a statement indicating that he was  "seriously disappointed" with the final product.  </P> <P> The commission "worked hard," said Rostenkowski, "but when the question of  financing arose, it ducked. That sort of evasion is unacceptable in today's  budget climate."  </P> <P> The long-term care program, providing for home-based services and 90 free days  of nursing home care, was approved by an 11-4 vote. Both Stark and Gradison  voted against it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HIGHLIGHTS OF PEPPER PLAN  </P> <P> The Pepper Commission, a bipartisan panel of legislators and presidential  appointees, proposed that Congress enact an ambitious program to provide health  insurance coverage for all Americans. The price tag would be $66 billion a year  in federal funds and $20 billion financed by private businesses.  </P> <P> Highlights of the plan include:  </P> <P> Mandatory health insurance coverage for all firms with 100 or more workers.  </P> <P> Subsidies and tax credits to encourage smaller firms to provide insurance.  </P> <P> Coverage under a public plan for all persons without private health insurance.  </P> <P> Free public insurance for pregnant women and children up to 6 in poor families.  </P> <P> Government-paid home care services for the severely disabled.  </P> <P> Free care for the first 90 days spent in a nursing home.  </P></p>

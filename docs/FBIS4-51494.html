			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kevin Barringtion] </F>   [Text] Phnom Penh, April 28 (AFP) -- King Norodom Sihanouk  called on the nominal leader of the Khmer Rouge [KR] on Thursday  to confirm whether he would attend peace talks in the capital,  as the guerrillas kept up military pressure in northwestern  Cambodia.    In a letter to Khieu Samphan, released by the Royal Palace,  the king said that because the May 2 date for the five-day  "Round Table of Peace and National Reconciliation" was  approaching he would like to know whether he and his Khmer Rouge  delegation would attend.    Khieu Samphan had earlier expressed his support for the  king's proposal to host the talks but then said he was worried  about his security in Phnom Penh.    The king, however, told Khieu Samphan the government needed  a  response in order to have sufficient time to arrange his  reception and assure his security while travelling from the  airport into the city.    A palace official said the king was "very upset" that there  had been no response from the Khmer Rouge.    Co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh, however, said he did  not  have much optimism for the outcome of the talks.    The prince told the diplomatic corps late Wednesday that if  the "Round Table" failed the government would resurrect plans to  have parliament formally outlaw the Khmer Rouge, a significant  move that would signal the end of the government's policy of  "keeping the door open" to talks with the guerrillas.    Meanwhile, Khmer Rouge guerrillas were reported to be  attacking government troop positions near the border town of  Poipet for the third consecutive day and, further south, were  pushing government troops back along National Route 10 towards  Battambang and away from the guerrilla's recently recaptured  headquarters at Pailin.    "The situation around Poipet and on Route 10 is very  serious," a government general in the capital said.    A government officer, reached by telephone in Battambang,  told AFP that the Khmer Rouge overran Treng and that government  soldiers withdrew to 10 kilometers (six miles) away.    Aid officials said thousands of people fled the area along  with retreating soldiers.    Treng was the government's original frontline position  before  the armed forces launched their offensive and pushed forward  some 40 kilometers (30 miles) to capture the resource-rich  Pailin region last month. The Khmer Rouge recaptured it last  week.    The officer, however, said there was no way the guerrillas  could advance any further towards Battambang.    Another government officer said General Pol Saroeun, the  commander of the forces that attacked Pailin, would be replaced.    The officer, explaining the battlefield setbacks, said the  troops were disillusioned with corrupt leaders and that the  rank-and-file felt little incentive to risk their lives.    In Banteay Meanchey province to the north, General Hun  Sothera of the government's 12th Division said the Khmer Rouge  were attacking his positions several kilometers (miles) east of  the normally bustling border town of Poipet.    "The guerrillas were attacking in waves of 150 backed by  artillery," he said.    A Thai military source in the Thai town of Aranyaprathet,  which is opposite Poipet, told reporters that the government  appeared to be holding its ground and gaining the upper hand.    The general said that most civilians had already fled Poipet  town and those remaining were ready to leave at any moment.    Government police said Khmer Rouge guerrillas killed 30  civilians when they attacked two pick-up trucks full of people  trying to flee the fighting.    The Khmer Rouge raked the trucks with automatic weapon fire  and fired rocket-propelled grenades as they were driving along  National Route 5 away from Poipet.    Government troops monitoring Khmer Rouge radio in nearby  Thmar Pouk said one-armed Khmer Rouge General Prum Su ordered  his troops to capture the town.    "If they failed he said he would cut off his other arm," a  government soldier said.</p>

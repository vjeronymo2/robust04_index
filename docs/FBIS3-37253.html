In his letter to both chambers of the Federal Assembly Boris  Yeltsin proposed that in adopting decisions they should proceed  from the total number of the deputies provided for by the  Constitution of the Russian Federation -- 178 for the Council of  the Federation and 450 for the State Duma, not from the number  of the actually elected members of the two chambers which is  somewhat smaller than that named in the fundamental law.    By declining the presidential amendments, the Council of the  Federation has created a precedent for the State Duma whose  chairman Ivan Rybkin was elected by a majority of one vote from  the number of actually elected deputies to the lower chamber  (223 from 444), not from the number of the deputies which should  be elected under the Constitution.</p>

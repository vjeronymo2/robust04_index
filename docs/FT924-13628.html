			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Foreign Affairs: Race towards instability - UN Security Council members do not practise what they preach about arms sales Gloom in Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne. Jubilation, presumably, in Lima, Ohio. General Dy-namics has won the contract to supply 236 tanks to Kuwait, and Vickers has lost it. Kuwait is spending about Pounds 1bn on this contract. Its only consideration  -one that has been almost lost from sight in the discussion about jobs and votes in the UK and US - should be whether, protected by those tanks, its citizens can sleep safer in their beds. Had the tanks been there on August 2 1990, would Iraq's President Saddam Hussein have been less likely to send his army across the border? Almost certainly it would have made no difference. Iraq would still have had overwhelming superiority, and Kuwait's willingness to spend money on weapons would not have altered Mr Saddam's low opinion of its fighting spirit. The weakness of the Gulf emirates and sheikhdoms is structural, not technical. They have a lot of money and very few people. Their neighbours, Iraq and Iran, are always going to be stronger, and Arab Gulf states, faced with renewed aggression from either of them, are always likely to need help from abroad. You would hardly think it needed saying again, but arms sales are not the route to a safer or more stable Middle East. Last December the UN General Assembly, responding to an initiative from the British government, established an Arms Transfer Register. It listed seven categories of weapons as potentially destabilising, because of their value in offensive operations. Main battle tanks come top of the list. The register is an important first step towards transparency of arms supplies, which in turn is a crucial confidence-building measure. Arms races, while fuelled partly by greed, can be publicly justified only by fear, and can sometimes be checked by shame. If the facts about your potential adversary's acquisitions are in the public domain, at least you do not have to base your own procurement programme on wild supposition; and in some cases purchases may be inhibited by the knowledge of the governments concerned that that they will be placed on public record. But a list of transfers by itself is not enough. To make it meaningful, the register should include existing national holdings and production. Also, at present transfers have to be registered only when they have physically taken place. Yet orders are often placed years in advance, and governments remain highly secretive about arms deals in the pipeline. When planning your own defences, it is what your adversary may have in the future that is relevant, at least as much as what he has now. In any case, transparency is only one prerequisite for a solution. Unless arms sales are effectively curtailed, the fact of their being public could even act as a stimulant. Suppliers and purchasers could use the register to show that they are only doing the same as their competitors or adversaries. The five permanent members of the UN Security Council ('the P5'), which happen also to be the largest arms suppliers, took the lead in proclaiming the need for greater restraint in the wake of the Gulf war. On a French suggestion, they have held regular meetings on the subject. But they hardly seem to be practising what they preach. According to the Saferworld Foundation, a research and lobbying charity, the US received arms orders worth about Dollars 28.5bn from the Middle East in the two years following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The principal client was Saudi Arabia, with orders of more than Dollars 17bn - and that was before US President George Bush approved the sale of 72 F-15 fighter jets last month. The administration predicts total US arms sales for 1992 worth Dollars 35bn, the majority going to the Middle East. Russia is still the second biggest arms supplier, although it is not so generous with precise figures. In 1991 it received orders worth Dollars 2bn from Syria alone, for weapons including T-72 main battle tanks, fighter aircraft and missiles. While Syria claims it needs these weapons to offset Israel's overwhelming superiority, Israel uses them as an argument to extract yet more sophisticated weapons from the US. It seems unlikely that the Middle East peace process, of which both the US and Russia are sponsors, is thereby facilitated. Even more destabilising, in both western and Arab eyes, are Russian arms supplies to Iran. The value of these is unknown, but in 1991 they reportedly included 25 Su-24 bombers, 50 MiG-29 fighters, an unknown number of MiG31 and Su-27 aircraft, and 200 T-72 main battle tanks. A Russian foreign ministry spokesman, Mr Sergei Yastrzhembsky, recently confirmed that Russia would go ahead with a contract to sell three Kilo-class diesel-powered submarines to Iran, reportedly worth Dollars 750m, even though the US Senate has banned any US aid to Russia until arms sales to Iran are halted. Annual hard-currency revenue from such sales would be three to four times greater than the credit blocked by the Senate, explained a senior official at the Russian ministry of foreign economic relations last week - which suggests reports that Iran is interested in purchasing a further 1,000-1,500 tanks and a variety of other equipment may be true. Mr Yastrzhembsky claimed: 'We take care to see that the regional balance is not upset.' But that notion of a regional balance is at the root of the arms race, since each state tends to measure itself against the combined strength of several different potential adversaries, and a state like Iran, placed at the intersection of the Middle East with central and south Asia, may even argue that it has to cope with threats from more than one region. The UK's Middle East order book of Dollars 4bn in 1990-92 looks meagre by comparison, but not for want of trying. Touting British equipment in the Gulf is still one of the main responsibilities of British defence ministers, and Vickers has been careful not to bite the hand that feeds it by blaming the government for its failure to win the Kuwait contract. France is in there too, with sales to Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Turkey and, of course, Saudi Arabia. And Chinese sales (including 72 F-7 aircraft to Iran in 1991) are supposed to be of particular concern to the US. Yet this did not stop Mr Bush authorising the sale of 150 F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan last month, prompting China to withdraw from the P5 talks on arms control in the Middle East. One glimmer of hope: the European Parliament, prompted by Saferworld, has called for an EC code of conduct on arms exports. It is true that under Article 223 of the Treaty of Rome the EC cannot prevent any member state from taking 'such measures as it considers necessary for the protection of the essential interests of its security which are connected with the production of or trade in arms'. But at least member states could be asked why they think arms sales to the Middle East are necessary, whereas arms sales to Bosnia (which is actually engaged in a struggle for survival, against aggression and 'ethnic cleansing') are still banned.  ----------------------------------------------              THE ARMS BAZAAR*  ---------------------------------------------- Country                                Amount  ---------------------------------------------- Abu Dhabi                             Unknown Bahrain                     Dollars 200m plus Egypt                          Dollars 2.25bn Iran                                  Unknown Israel                    Dollars 1.35bn plus** Kuwait                    Dollars 3.25bn plus Oman                             Dollars 594m Qatar                                 Unknown Saudi Arabia             Dollars 25.63bn plus Syria                        Dollars 2bn plus Turkey                    Dollars 6.23bn plus UAE                       Dollars 1.18bn plus  ---------------------------------------------- *Firm orders Aug 1990-July 1992 **Plus Dollars 3bn for new fighters early '93  ---------------------------------------------- Source: Saferworld Foundation  ----------------------------------------------</p>

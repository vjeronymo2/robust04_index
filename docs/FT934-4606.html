			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Parties try to fan east's fading fires: Voter interest in Brandenburg's poll is low Political parties in the east German state of Brandenburg may disagree with one another on many issues, but one concern unites them: fear of a low turnout in next Sunday's local government elections, the first since unification. More than 30 per cent of the electorate have yet to decide which party they will vote for - or even if they will vote at all. 'You would imagine people would jump at the chance to vote,' says Mr Thomas Klein, general secretary of the opposition Christian Democratic Union. His party needs all the votes it can muster. A recent opinion poll gave it only 9 per cent, compared to 29.4 per cent in 1990's state elections. The Free Democrats, the CDU's junior partner in the Bonn coalition, is expected to get a miserable 3 per cent, compared to 6.6 per cent in 1990. 'These polls, and the election results, are a signal for the way in which eastern Germany could vote in next year's state and federal elections,' says Mr Klein, who helped organise the CDU's 1990 campaign in Brandenburg. Social Democrats in Brandenburg, the only one of the five eastern states the party controls, are expected to win 36 per cent of the vote, slightly less than in 1990. But party activists are taking no chances. Election posters drum home the message: 'We call on all citizens to participate.' Mr Manfred Stolpe, Brandenburg's prime minister and an east German, keeps returning to this theme in his speeches: 'Voting matters. It will strengthen democracy. If you throw away your vote, others will make the decisions.' What has compounded the fear of a poor turnout is the low level of political participation. 'Here in Brandenburg, elections cannot be held in one in five local communities and councils because we can't find a candidate. Nobody wants to stand,' says Mr Klein. 'There are all sorts of reasons for this strange phenomenon,' he adds. 'People were forced to participate politically over the past 40 years. Many aspects of their lives were politicised.' This partly explains low membership of political parties. The SPD has 6,000 paid-up members, the CDU 11,500, Free Democrats 3,000, Greens 750, and the Party of Democratic Socialists (PDS), or reformed Communists, has 20,000, 90 per cent of them former Communists. Mr Wolfgang Thierse, an east Berliner and a senior member of the SPD, says: 'This is a worrying trend. We are finding it difficult to create new, local political elites, not only in Brandenburg but throughout eastern Germany. It will take time. But the political parties themselves must work harder at local level.' What worries the established parties is that a low turnout will play into the hand of the PDS. It is not that they expect a return to Socialist-dominated governments, even at the local level. 'What it means,' says a senior SPD official, 'is that the PDS could have a bargaining position when it comes to forming coalition local government councils, and that's a slap in the face for the centre and the old status quo. Unless the CDU and SPD join forces.' Indeed, the PDS, which inherited the Communist party's organisation and structure, might even take Potsdam, the state capital, from the SPD. Says Mr Lothar Nicht, PDS party manager in Brandenburg: 'People all know us. We are all locals.' More than 90 per cent of the party's 23,000 paid-up members are former Communists. In Mr Nicht's view there is no need to defend his party's record before unification. 'The PDS has now broken with the past.' The far right, consisting of the Republicans and the Democratic League, have only eight candidates standing in three towns. 'We don't expect them to play a big role,' says Mr Klein. But officials across the political spectrum say the inhabitants of these towns, which include Eisenhuttenstadt, whose loss-making steel mill threatens further redundancies, and the lignite mines near Cottbus, could be vulnerable to the populist slogans of the extreme right and the PDS. According to Ms Petra Weissflog, spokeswoman for the Greens/Bundis 90: 'People don't trust the politicians. . . They are also disappointed with unification, especially the high level of unemployment. They do not have much of a perspective. They have other things to think about besides listening to politicians who cannot deliver on their promises.' Brandenburg's unemployment rate is nearly 20 per cent. 'Why should we trust anyone?' asks Mr Horst Wegner, a 39-year-old lorry driver. 'Look at those Wessis (westerners) running Saxony-Anhalt, and fiddling their expenses. They don't need the money. And we don't need them. If I bother to vote, it will for one of us, and none of those Wessis.' Whether that meant voting for the far right, the PDS or Mr Stolpe, he would not say.</p>

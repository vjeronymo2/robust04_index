			<p>BFN     [Text] Commenting on the Bank of Thailand's policy of  encouraging Thai commercial banks to increase baht loans to the  Indochinese countries, Banthun Lamsam, managing director of the  Thai Farmers Bank, said his bank's Vientiane branch office has  been unable to release many loans to local entrepreneurs because  Lao law does not facilitate such bank operations. Meanwhile,  Cambodia does not have any law to protect bank credits.  Therefore, operations in that country are rather risky.    Banthun noted that current measures applied by the  government  to control the amount of loans are incompatible with the free  trade market system. In other words, the measures are  impractical because the demand for bank loans in Thailand is  still high.    Banthun said: "In implementing the state bank's policy of  increasing the baht's role in this region, the open market  mechanism -- that is, interest rates -- must be allowed to  control the demand for bank loans completely."    He indicated that the amount of trade among countries in the  region will determine the expansion of the baht's role. The  baht is, however, widely used as a medium of exchange in Laos.  The Thai Farmers Bank will continue to make loans in  neighboring countries provided it does not have to assume too  much risk.    The managing director of the Thai Farmers Bank said the  countries in which the baht is well recognized are Laos, Burma,  and southern China, because they are engaging in the quadrangle  economic development scheme. But the baht's access to Cambodia  is hindered by the lack of legal support in that country.    Banthun said: "The baht has bright prospects in the  quadrangle economic zone. It will be used as a common medium of  trade by all parties participating in the development scheme.</p>

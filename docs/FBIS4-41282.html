			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 24 (ITAR-TASS) -- The ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA  newspaper describes today "sensational" proposals to extend the  term of powers of Russian legislators by another two years as a  sudden development in political events.    Most different opinions are expressed on this development in  various quarters, including legislators.    Examining favourable arguments, the newspaper notes that any  new elections will whip up a powerful wave of political  struggle. The interests of the economy, production and the  social sphere will again fall victim of politicis.    Besides, new positive elements have appeared now: The public  accord treaty was signed, and it was possible to stabilise  inflationary processes.    The president issued several important economic decrees and  announced emergency measures to fight organised crime. All  these raise confidence in authorities. The newspaper also quotes  arguments "against": the very idea of extending legislators'  powers needs amendments to the constitution, and this is  possible only through a new nation-wide referendum during which  passions will fly high.    "It is impossible to deny that the very idea of Eurasia  symbolises that the nations of today's so-called post-Soviet  space have common destinies," chairman of the Party of Russian  Unity and Accord Sergey Shakhray says in an interview with the  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper today.    "It is possible that public opinion will adopt another  integration ideology. This is a question open for discussion.  However, it is clear now that the Eurasian idea, as it was the  case in the past, again became a banner of a very difficult  `transition' period. This idea reminds, for the umpteenth time,  our peoples of `their will for a common cause' awakening at the  most difficult times of history.    The same newspaper features an article by Aleksey Arbatov,  D.Sc. (history), who writes: "The top priority of the Russian  foreign policy is to promote independence and stability of new  neighbouring states as well as the development of good relations  with them on an individual basis.    "If this is too expensive, we should invite to such a  strategy other foreign countries in the framework of a new broad  system of multilateral cooperation and security."    The TRUD newspaper pays attention to economic problems. "the  Russian economy has set a record," the newspaper writes.  "However, we do not hear loud commentaries, let alone fanfares.    "The record, as it is, is very significant: Russia reached  the lowest level of inflation in may for the first time in two  and a half years of reforms -- 6.9 per cent. It is the lowest  in the past 30 months since november of the pre-reform year of  1991.    "But the government is in no hurry to receive  congratulations. Firstly, there is no confidence that prices  will not start rise again in July. Secondly, and this is the  main thing, the drop in inflation was achieved by an exorbitant  price: Industrial production continues to fall, and this  nation-wide fall is assuming more disquieting and dangerous  nature."    Commenting on the president's decree on urgent measures to  protect population from banditry and other manifestations of  organised crime, the NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA notes: "The  president's decree means nothing but emergency measures: Bandit  groups appeared not recently, while the criminal code written  long ago has article 77 entitled `banditry' providing for most  strict punishment. However, nothing is heard about cases under  this article, let alone court sentences...".    The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper carries an interview with  former Ukrainian Premier Leonid Kuchma touching on the problem  of the Crimea.    "Many try to show the Crimea's desire for independence as a  result of the activities of pro-Russian political forces in the  region," he writes. "Sure, there are such forces. But it would  be inadmissible simplification to limit this problem only to  these activities.    "The general and presidential elections in the Crimea showed  that the majority of population supports the present policy of  the Crimean leadership and its desire for independent solution  of problems.    "I'm deeply convinced that tension around the peninsula is  linked with the general crisis in Ukraine. We should frankly  and with criticism point to two main factors estranging the  Crimea from Ukraine.    "The first is self-destruction of the Ukrainian economy. The  second factor is politics. If we do not switch to regional  bilingual practice and do not stop national-radicalisation of  historical science, arts and public education, we shall witness  conflicts in other Ukrainian regions as well."    The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper features an interview with  Colonel- General Valeriy Patrikeyev, commander of the Collective  Peace- Keeping Force (CPKF) in Tajikistan.    "Despite the emerging stabilisation of the situation in  Tajikistan, I warn anybody that this will not prompt the CPKF to  decrease its vigilance and combat preparedness. I assure all  interested sides: This will not take place."    The last stage of building the Argus platform began under  the  Russian programme "Mars-1996". The SANKT PETERBURGSKIE  VEDOMOSTI newspaper reports that its development involves the  all-Russian transport engineering institute, the author of many  modifications of planet buggies.    The platform will start operating when a station is put into  an orbit of the Mars. The Argus is to direct equipment on  definite points of the planet's surface, ensuring precise  transmission of information.    The ROSSIYSKIE VESTI claims that chemist Tamara Svishcheva  carried out sensational experiments at Russian institutes. They  corroborated a parasitic theory of cancer's origin, which was  developed by Professor M. Nevedomsky and which was defeated in  the 1960s.    Its essence is that the formidable ailment is caused by  one-cell parasites. It is they and not human cells that start  avalanche multiplication in a weakened organism.</p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Mexico to privatise airports MEXICO is to sell concessions to manage the country's airports and sea ports, deepening its commitment to privatise much of basic national infrastructure. The Airports and Auxiliary Services revealed that the first airports to be sold are likely be those at the Caribbean resort of Cancun and the north-western city of Tijuana, on the US border. Both require new terminals. The government hopes the private sector will make the investment needed. Few details have been revealed but Mr Carlos Cardenas, head of the national chamber of construction, told El Economista newspaper that airport concessions for up to 20-30 years are likely to be sold. Foreign investors will almost certainly be welcome. The scheme will be similar to that of concessions granted for building toll roads, he said. The government has already granted concessions for more than 3,500 km of toll roads, at an estimated cost to the private sector of about Dollars 5bn. Last month, the Mexican company PACSA issued Dollars 312.7m (Pounds 163.7m) of highway bonds to finance the Mexico City-Toluca motorway. Some Dollars 207.5m of the bonds were acquired by international investors. This was the first time such bonds have been sold outside Mexico. The transport and communications secretary said this month that Mexican ports needed to follow Singapore's example. The minister earmarked for privatisation the ports of Lazaro Cardenas, Manzanillo and Topolobampo on the Pacific coast, and those of Veracruz, Tampico and Progreso on the east coast.</p>

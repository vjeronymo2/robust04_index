			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Mexico link helps Ionica raise Pounds 30m Ionica, the private Cambridge-based telecommunications company pioneering radio access technology, has raised Pounds 30m this year. A strategic partnership with Pulsar, the Mexican conglomerate, accounts for most of the investment, which takes Ionica's equity base to Pounds 45m. Ionica aims to offer a telecoms service for 'fixed' phones in competition with BT, using radio links for its local network instead of underground cable. It is piloting its technology in East Anglia and plans to launch its service next year. Pulsar plans to use the technology to offer a similar service in Mexico.</p>

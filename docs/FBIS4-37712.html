			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 23 (AFP) -- A heavy northern  bombardment of this southern city killed 12 civilians and  wounded 98 on Thursday as shells slammed into the fish market  and other central sites, hospital officials said.    Wounded soldiers were meanwhile pouring into military  hospitals from frontlines 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the city  where dawn artillery duels left three southern troops dead and  28 wounded, the officials said.    Two shells hit the fish market at al-Mu'alla on the sea  front, killing two people and wounded around a dozen others,  several seriously. A salvo of Kaytusha rockets destroyed five  houses in the working class district of al-Mansurah. Shells also  hit the Khormaksar district near the airport and northern  suburbs near the front.    A southern military spokesman said three missiles were also  fired at Aden, two of which were brought down by anti-aircraft  fire. The third exploded on the hills overlooking the town,  injuring two women and damaging wooden houses.    Northern forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and  southerners backing his rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid have been locked  in civil war for almost two months.</p>

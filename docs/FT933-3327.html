			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading TECHNICAL trading in the derivatives sector ahead of Friday's expiry of both the September Footsie future and the index options brought a sharp decline in the former, sending it to close at a discount to cash, writes Joel Kibazo. Traders in the September contract on the FT-SE had indicated at the outset that 'stop loss' orders were to be the dominant factor this week. Having opened strongly at 3,047, on the back of Friday's strong Wall Street, September briefly advanced to 3,052 before it succumbed to a selling which saw it fall to 3,028. The downward trend continued throughout the session on fears that arbitrageurs holding large cash positions might dump stock playing a part in depressing sentiment. September not only pulled the cash market lower but was soon trading at a discount to cash. It recovered from the day's low of 3,016 to end the session at 3,020, at a slight discount to the underlying cash market. The rolling forward of positions from September to the December contract once again boosted volume. Some 11,437 lots were traded in the near month contract and December saw business of 5,051 lots. Volume in the traded options recovered from Friday's poor level reaching 30,012 contracts. The FT-SE 100 option accounted for half of the day's business with a total of 15,479 lots traded. Lonrho was the the busiest stock option at 1,700 contracts.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sheri Prasso] </F>   [Text] Phnom Penh, March 31 (AFP) -- Having captured the  Khmer Rouge [KR] stronghold at Pailin last week, the Cambodian  Army will aim next at the guerrillas' mountain base on the Thai  border, home to their top commanders, a Cambodian general  declared in a report Thursday.    The base, on a mountain called Phnom Malai, is where up to  30,000 Cambodian refugees were repatriated by the Thai military,  after fleeing the fighting at Pailin, with the assurance that  they would be safe there.    Not far from the northwest Aranyaprathet-Poipet border  crossing, Phnom Malai is believed to be the permanent home of  Khmer Rouge second-in-command Ieng Sary, as well as the  part-time residence of the clandestine leader of the radical  guerrillas, Pol Pot.    Border intelligence reports reaching Phnom Penh indicate  that  Pol Pot divides his time between his house in Phnom Malai, a  second residence in a compound just inside the border from the  Thai town of Trat, and a third in the Thai capital, Bangkok. The  fanatical Maoist is responsible for the deaths of a million  Cambodians in the "Killing Fields" during his rule in the 1970s.    "We are waiting for orders from the Royal Government. Then  we  can attack Phnom Malai at any time," said General Lay Vireak,  quoted in the daily Khmer-language REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA newspaper.  "The Royal Cambodian Armed Forces are ready to capture Phnom  Malai, which is a stronghold of 5,000 Khmer Rouge fighters," he  said. "It is not as easy to attack as Pailin, because it is a  real Khmer Rouge soldiers' base, whereas Pailin is only an  economic base."    Pailin's ruby and sapphire mines and its rich hardwood  forests provided an estimated one million dollars per month in  revenues to Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who allowed concessions to  Thai mining companies.    Although invading government troops have found several  hundred tonnes of weapons hidden around Pailin, its primary  purpose was economic and strategic rather than military,  diplomats and observers here say. The road to Phnom Malai is  paved on the Thai side of the border, but on the Cambodian side,  the mountainous, jungle-covered and malarial slopes will pose a  formidable challenge to government troops already under pressure  as they hold onto Pailin. In addition, the government is still  using its resources in an attempt to retake parts of the Khmer  Rouge's base in northern Cambodia, at Anlong Veng, which it  captured and lost in February, diplomatic sources say.    Co-premier Hun Sen, who controls the Army, is likely to wait  until the areas are more secure, before ordering the opening of  another front, according to diplomats. Khmer Rouge troops at  Phnom Malai shelled government troops reinforcing Pailin --  about 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) to the south -- for one hour on  Monday, the newspaper said. It reported 62 Khmer Rouge and  seven government soldiers dead, three Khmer Rouge captured and  600 AK-47s seized, but did not give the time frame for the  fighting.    Another general reached by telephone denied a claim on Khmer  Rouge radio that guerrillas had completely surrounded the  government troops at Pailin and at a second location, Sala Krau.  "We are not in the Khmer Rouge trap," he said. "We don't need  to worry. We can match any manpower of theirs with our own.</p>

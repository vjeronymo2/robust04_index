(Locally, those include AMC's Fullerton 8, Orange Mall and Santa Ana Mainplace  Theaters.)  </P> <P> Turtle creators Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman are in discussions with the staff  at the Center for Marine Conservation about "doing conservation-themed stories  in the (Ninja Turtle TV) cartoon series," according to Marydele Donnelly,  director of its Sea Turtle Conservation Program. "We're really pleased with the  interest the movie is generating."  </P> <P>  Ernie Reyes Jr., the young martial artist who performs as one of the film  turtles, is helping the Earth Island Institute.  </P> <P> SI Stacy Jenel Smith  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Gabicci hit by poor men's wear market Gabicci, the USM-quoted casual clothing group, reported a sharp contraction in annual profits, reflecting falling consumer demand for its core men's wear brand. On turnover down 18 per cent to Pounds 20m, pre-tax profits for the year to June 19 fell 63 per cent to Pounds 524,000 (Pounds 1.43m) after exceptional costs of Pounds 250,000. However, Mr Jack Sofier, chairman, said indications for the spring were 'looking positive' and exports, particularly to the US, were 'quite buoyant.' Earnings per share dropped from 8.8p to 2.9p. The final dividend is cut to 0.6p (2.85p) reducing the total to 2p (4.25p). Losses and the cost of closing the Gransden Casualwear offshoot were taken as a Pounds 314,000 extraordinary charge.</p>

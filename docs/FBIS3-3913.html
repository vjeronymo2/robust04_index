			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley in Beijing] </F>   [Text] An intellectual salon born during the 1989  Tiananmen Square protests is to drop its focus on present-day  China after five years of government imposed restrictions.    The Modern Culture Society of China, which held its founding  meeting within earshot of students parading for change in May  1989, will turn its attention to ancient Chinese culture, say  founding members at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences  (Cass) in Beijing.    The renamed Chinese Cultural Society will stress "the  traditional virtues of the Chinese people", one founding member  said. "We will no longer pay attention to modern problems.  It's no good doing that now."    The society has been under strict supervision by the State  Council, which runs Cass, since its brief flirtation with free  expression in 1989, members said. "The society was established  during a high-point of discussion about Chinese culture and  society. We could hear the students chanting on Changan Avenue  during the founding meeting," one member said. The original 50  members came mainly from the history and literature departments  of leading Beijing universities. "The permitted scope of the  society has faced many restrictions. Not all the territory has  been opened for discussion," said one member at the People's  University.    The move into an area more palatable to the senior  leadership  will be supported by the central government, which will approve  a national charitable society to support the new group's  academic endeavours, the founding member said. Wealthy foreign  and domestic businessmen will be sought as benefactors of the  Chinese Cultural Research Fund, which the central bank was  expected to grant tax-free status as a charity this year.    The society has been suffering from money shortages since  its  inauspicious founding and had difficulty scraping together funds  for its fifth anniversary celebration this year. About 60  mainland scholars attended the society's seminars in Beijing in  1991 and in Hainan province last year. The society was  criticised by Beijing leaders after a resolution was passed at  the Hainan seminar calling for "a new culture to fit the new  era". "This was at odds with the party's stress on the  construction of a civilised society based on traditional Chinese  morals and values," said one member who attended the Hainan  seminar, entitled "Trends in modern Chinese culture".    Months of internal bickering among members about how to  resolve the society's financial and intellectual crises finally  ended earlier this month when a decision was made to "follow the  trend and concentrate on ancient things", one member said.    Some dissenting members have resigned from the society in  protest. "They have effectively ended the whole idea of the  society," said one ex-member. "In five years of activities they  never managed to achieve a breakthrough."</p>

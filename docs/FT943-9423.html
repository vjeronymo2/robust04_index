			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Surrender values of endowment mortgages criticised Most people taking out endowment mortgages are significantly worse off than those taking out repayment mortgages if they surrender the policies in the first five years, according to a survey by the Office of Fair Trading. The figures will give fresh impetus to the OFT's campaign for a self-regulatory requirement for lenders to offer the most suitable advice to customers. The campaign was revived last year by Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, but the revised code of banking practice published in February did not address the issue. Banks and building societies receive commission from life insurance companies for selling endowment mortgages rather than ones that simply repay the loan at the end of the term. With an endowment, the monthly charge is split between an interest payment to the lender, and a premium to a life company which invests the money and also provides life insurance. At the end of the term, the endowment is supposed to cover the loan and provide an additional lump sum. The OFT survey, due to be published this autumn, is expected to show that if an endowment is surrendered at the end of the first year, someone paying Pounds 100 a month for a policy would on average be Pounds 600-Pounds 800 worse off than if they had taken out a repayment mortgage. If the surrender occurred at the end of the fifth year, then the relative disadvantage would be Pounds 1,600-Pounds 1,800 on average. In the worst cases the disadvantage can be almost twice the average. Among the policies examined, only one company is thought to have offered an endowment that gives a better deal than a repayment if it is surrendered in the first five years. Figures from one lender are said to suggest that about one-third of endowment policies are surrendered in the first four to five years. The report on mortgage surrender values will make it harder for lenders to ignore the calls for some form of 'best advice' requirement, especially as it will be followed with further work on the subject early next year. Last month, the Council of Mortgage Lenders raised the prospect of introducing a voluntary code of practice. This would include sending a 'reason why' to a borrower, setting out the type of mortgage and explaining why it was appropriate. In June the OFT published figures on life company savings plans. Sir Bryan said the life industry should now have 'a bit of time to settle down' after significant regulatory changes. Carsberg urges crackdown, on 'oppressive' sellers, Page 5</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Accounting board recruits DTI official THE ACCOUNTING Standards Board is to recruit a senior official from the Department of Trade and Industry to help it make accounts easier to understand. Mr Michael Butcher, head of accounting and audit policy at the DTI, is to join the board on secondment for at least a year from August. He will help to make draft standards issued by the board less wordy and technical. He will also start work on a two-to-three-year project producing guidelines on the inclusion of a statement in annual accounts to clarify financial information to non-professionals. Mr David Tweedie, head of the board, has long said he wants to make accounts more understandable. Critics have accused the ASB of producing standards that are highly technical and increasingly difficult for non-professional investors to use.</p>

Here is the text of the statement:    The secretariat of the General People's Congress reiterates  its anger at and condemnation of the horrible crime perpetrated  in the Ibrahimi mosque and the repeated acts of aggression  against the heroic Palestinian people which followed.    This horrible crime and other crimes perpetrated by the  occupying Israeli invaders are considered the vilest acts of  terrorism against innocent people performing the morning prayer  in the middle of the blessed month of Ramadan.    The secretariat of the General People's Congress stresses  that this crime and the others that have followed it are  officially organized terrorism officially directed by the  Israeli Government, which has based its existence on such a  program since its establishment under the protection of the  West, which has officially supported the policy of terrorism  manifested in crimes, massacres, and the building of arsenals  for weapons of mass destruction.    The secretariat of the General People's Congress, in  addressing the conscience of humanity and all honorable people  of the world headed by the sons of the Arab and Islamic nation,  is insistent that that an end must be put to the tyranny,  oppression, and repression exercised by the Israelis for racial  motives and with the support of the West. The secretariat urges  all of them, Arab and Islamic countries to exercise their rights  in the UN Security Council, the United Nations, and the  international forums to punish the tyrants who have been blinded  by force and fanaticism, to put an end to their terrorist  behavior and boycott them.    The secretariat of the General People's Congress asks that  everyone should shoulder their responsibilities vis-a-vis these  repeated horrible crimes which give warning of the results,  which will have reprehensible consequences.    [Signed] The secretariat of the General People's Congress of  the Great Jamahiriyah</p>

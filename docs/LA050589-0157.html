			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SINGLE LIFE: DIVORCE ANONYMOUS: A PEACEFUL HARBOR AFTER THE STORM OF MARITAL  BREAKUP  </P> <P> When Nancy's husband left her after 25 years of marriage, she suffered "a  terrible feeling of rejection, a horrible depression."  </P> <P> For Judy, "the hardest thing was trying to leave the kids out of it."  </P> <P> John, who had been married just 6 months when he discovered that his bride was  having an affair, "went through a whole span of feelings -- abandonment,  embarrassment."  </P> <P> Gwen's marital breakup left her with the sense that she "was completely alone  in the world."  </P> <P> All four victims of marriages gone bad found solace and unity in Divorce  Anonymous, a support group that meets weekly.  </P> <P> Nancy and Gwen, who along with the others asked that their last names not be  printed, last year helped establish an Orange County chapter of the Los  Angeles-based organization. About a dozen participants -- some returning, some  new -- show up for the free meetings, held every Monday night at the YWCA in  Orange (for information, call (714) 633-4950).  </P> <P> The "DA" program follows the 12-step approach of Alcoholics Anonymous, focusing  on internal strengths rather than external blame. "As in AA, our philosophy is  to take one day at a time," Gwen said.  </P> <P> Discussions are more conversational than structured. "Our meetings aren't  monitored by a therapist," Gwen said. "We give each other support and advice."  </P> <P> "Many times, people return to the group after dropping out for a while," Nancy  said. "Going through a divorce is like being on a roller coaster. You can be up  one day, down the next. It's nice to know (Divorce Anonymous) is there when you  need it."  </P> <P> Sometimes therapy alone is not enough, explained the 52-year-old Laguna Beach  woman. "I've been in therapy ever since separating from my husband 3 years  ago," Nancy said. "But this group helps me in a different way because you're  with people who are going through the same things.  </P> <P> "Our stories are always so similar that it sounds as if we were all married to  the same person," Nancy added with a laugh. "That helps. You look at these  other people who are all wonderful, and you realize that even wonderful people  get left."  </P> <P> "It's easier to see your own problems in someone else than it is in yourself;  you learn from seeing how other people are reacting to the same difficulties  you're experiencing," said Judy, who described her ex-husband as a "womanizer."  </P> <P> Most participants are, in DA jargon, the "dumpees" -- spouses who were  abandoned. And most participants are women.  </P> <P> "We've noticed in the group that the men who are dumped are at first devastated  but recover a lot faster than the women," said Judy, 56, of Anaheim. "Men tend  to remarry sooner because there are more single women than single men in the  over-40 age brackets. Also, women many times have to start over, whereas men  already have jobs."  </P> <P> Gwen, 48, married her high school sweetheart right after graduation,  immediately started having children and never pursued a college education.  "Even talking about having a career of my own was an insult to (her husband);  it meant that he couldn't take care of his family," she said.  </P> <P> Today Gwen temporarily lives with her daughter in Orange while taking college  classes. "I still don't know the direction to go in," she said. "I need to get  some kind of training."  </P> <P> On the day her husband left her 2 years ago, Gwen panicked at the thought of  being alone. "I was obsessing on the fact: How am I going to stay by myself  tonight?" Gwen recalled. "Now I almost laugh at that."  </P> <P> A rare male participant in Divorce Anonymous, John cautiously waited until age  34 before marrying last summer. "I didn't take marriage lightly; I really  thought that I had found the right person," he said.  </P> <P> He and his fiancee dated and then lived together for a total of 2 years before  their marriage. So when he realized her infidelity only a few months after  their wedding, he "was thrown for a loop."  </P> <P> "It was quite a blow," John said. "The marriage meant a lot to me."  </P> <P> After spotting a notice for Divorce Anonymous in the newspaper, John  tentatively attended a meeting. "The first night I went, I didn't say much; I  just listened," he remembered. "They made me feel welcome, anyway. You don't  have to talk if you don't want to.  </P> <P> "You begin to open up after a couple of meetings. I thought what happened to me  must have never happened to anyone else in the entire world, but I learned that  wasn't true. When I finally told the group about my experience, another man  said, 'You just described my wife.' "  </P> <P> That feeling of commonality, participants agree, is the magic of Divorce  Anonymous.  </P> <P> "Your friends don't know how to react; you get a lot of free advice," John  said. "But divorce is something you have to go through yourself in order to  understand everything involved."  </P> <P> "Friends and relatives can listen to you for only so long," Judy said. Divorce  Anonymous, she said, "is a good place to go to talk things out."  </P> <P> Marge Vinolus, a licensed clinical social worker with Tustin Psychotherapy  Group, affirmed that the main benefit of a self-help group such as Divorce  Anonymous is that of camaraderie. "Divorce makes people feel very isolated,"  she observed.  </P> <P> "It is very important to see where you are in the process, compared to where  other people are. And divorce is a process -- a very long process. Talking with  others allows you to see that what you're going through -- the loss of  self-esteem, the grieving -- is normal."  </P> <P> However, she added, discussion groups that are not guided by a professional  should guard against "focusing only on the negative."  </P> <P> "Sometimes a self-help group can turn into a place where people just sit around  and rehash how bad they are feeling, which may increase those bad feelings,"  said Vinolus, who specializes in relationship therapy. "At some point, you have  to move beyond that stage of the process."  </P> <P> Still, she said, a leader-less group can lend participants a sense of control  at a time when they have suffered loss of control: "It gives them the  opportunity to set their own rules."  </P> <P> Not only does Divorce Anonymous offer a harbor for soul-baring, Nancy said, it  also provides a format for the exchange of practical information. "We recommend  attorneys to one another -- that sort of thing," she said.  </P> <P> Whatever the situation, John suggested, people should not attempt to tough out  a divorce in the vacuum of their personal heartbreak.  </P> <P> "Talk to friends, talk to a clergy, go to Divorce Anonymous meetings," he said.  "Don't sit around the house dwelling on your problems."  </P></p>

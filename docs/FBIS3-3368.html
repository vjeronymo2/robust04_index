Tsui Sze-men said: According to the Sino-British "Joint  Declaration," the British Government must terminate all its  governing activities in Hong Kong (including Kowloon and the New  Territories) on 30 June 1997 and smoothly hand over sovereignty  and governing power over Hong Kong to the Chinese Central  Government, and it may not recant or evade its obligations under  any pretext. Now, only a little more than 1,200 days before the  return, Chris Patten, the last British governor and politician  who was defeated in election in his own country, on numerous  occasions openly broke the country's promise under various  pretexts, culminating in the termination of Sino-British talks.  Without the Chinese Government's approval, he unilaterally  submitted the so-called "Chris Patten political reform program"  -- a program that infringes on China's sovereignty -- to the  "Legislative Council" [Legco], which functions entirely under  British colonial rule, for implementation after its "approval."    Tsui Sze-men said: Every time they withdraw from a country  or region, the British colonialists use tricks to create  contradictions and divide the country or region. Their habitual  tricks have been personally experienced by Hong Kong compatriots  today, and the British Government's two sinister attempts  pursued by Chris Patten on its behalf have been completely  exposed to the light of day. Its first attempt is to create a  pro-British legislative body on the basis of Patten's political  reform program, a body that listens to London and imposes itself  on Hong Kong after 30 June 1997. Another is to plunder every  penny of the Hong Kong Government's fiscal surplus of 130  billion Hong Kong dollars, ignoring the past friendship between  Britain and China and British long-term interests. Making  Chinese Government's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong  ineffective and plundering Hong Kong's fiscal surplus are Chris  Patten's two most despicable attempts. These short- sighted  sinister attempts are not only opposed by the great majority of  the Hong Kong compatriots, they are also opposed by more and  more people in business and diplomatic circles in Britain itself.    Tsui Sze-men pointed out: At this crucial moment, the  Chinese Government issued a resolute statement which solemnly  points out that with the termination of "Letters Patent" and  "Royal Instructions" in Hong Kong by 30 June 1997, all the  legislative bodies created unilaterally by British politicians  at various levels in Hong Kong will be disbanded. According to  the Basic Law and the relevant provisions of the National  People's Congress [NPC], legislative bodies at various levels  which embody China's sovereignty will be organized, beginning on  1 July 1997. The NPC Standing Committee was far-sighted in  adopting the decision on organizing the Preliminary Work  Committee [PWC] for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong  Special Administrative Region [HKSAR]. Since then, the members  from Hong Kong and those from the mainland in the PWC have  cooperated faithfully with each other and stepped up the study  of the organization of the HKSAR Government, the selection of  its chief executive, and the election of its legislative bodies  at various levels. First, the second group of nearly 100 Hong  Kong affairs advisers are seriously putting forward opinions and  suggestions and playing the role of a collective body of wisdom.  The third group of advisers will be hired soon. The PWC itself  will be properly strengthened. Nearly 300 Hong Kong district  affairs advisers, many of whom are from the grass-roots level,  were hired on 5 March. These talented people are working with  one heart and one mind in making a preliminary exploration of  ways for Hong Kong people to administer Hong Kong. Tsui Sze-men  was convinced that the Chinese Government has both the  determination and the ability to ensure Hong Kong's smooth  transition and continued stability and prosperity. Hong Kong  will certainly be prosperous so long as the motherland's  mainland enjoys stability and economic development.    Tsui Sze-men said: One country with two systems,  administering Hong Kong by the Hong Kong people, and a high  degree of autonomy can be realized according to the Hong Kong  "Basic Law" only after China's central government completely  recovers Hong Kong's sovereignty and administration. Reliance  on foreign forces and use of the pretext of accelerating  democracy and making Hong Kong people administer Hong Kong  sooner are in violation of both China's sovereignty and the  Chinese people's aspirations. None of the attempts can succeed.    Tsui Sze-men said: As a representative of overseas Chinese,  I took part in the flag-raising ceremony for Burma's  independence in Burma on January 4, 1948. I also attended the  last Burmese governor's flag-lowering ceremony. I witnessed  Britain's Major General (Lance), holding a British flag, walk  out of the governor's office in tears. It will be my pleasure  to witness the last Hong Kong governor walk out of the  governor's office. It will be different from what I did in  Burma. At that time, I was invited to attend the ceremony as a  guest. Next time, I will attend the ceremony as the host and  will be particularly happy and honored.    Tsui Sze-men said: Premier Li Peng said in his "government  work report": "I hope the PWC will unite the Hong Kong  compatriots in a comprehensive way, make good preparations for  establishing the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and its  first government and legislative body, and live up to the  expectation and great trust placed in it by the people across  the country." Since I heard this passage, I have felt that the  responsibility resting on my shoulders is very heavy and  important because I am a PWC member. I will unite with all the  forces in Hong Kong that I can and will make the greatest  efforts for Hong Kong's smooth transition in the second half of  the transitional period and for its successful reversion.</p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIDING ISRAEL CAN PROVE DEADLY;  </P> <P> A LIFE OF BETRAYAL: DANGER STALKS ARAB COLLABORATORS  </P> <P> "When you stop giving milk, they throw you away," M. said as he contemplated  his plight as a petty informer in danger. "My friends in the security forces  haven't helped me at all. I'm burned."  </P> <P> M., an Arab from the village of Silwan near Jerusalem, is on the run. Branded  as a collaborator, he believes he is being pursued by three Palestinian Muslim  extremists who want to kill him. He cannot return to his home, where his family  and neighbors condemn him as a traitor.  </P> <P> Without support from the police, he has taken refuge here in Kiryat Arba, the  most militant of the Jewish settlements on the West Bank. But he wants to quit  his double life and convert to Judaism, become Israeli in body and soul, and  change his name and the names of his seven children to Hebrew versions.  </P> <P> "I do not feel Arab anymore," M. said as he adjusted his kippa, the traditional  Jewish skullcap, worn at a tilt on his head.  </P> <P> M.'s story opens a rare window onto the seamy world of collaboration, a subject  of deadly significance these days in Israel, where informers in the service of  the Shin Bet, the domestic intelligence service, are at the center of military  efforts to put down the Arab uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.  Palestinians have responded by undertaking a campaign of vengeance against  suspected collaborators.  </P> <P> Hardly a day passes without a report of a brutal attack by an Arab on another  Arab accused of betraying the Palestinian national cause. Suspected informers  have been shot in hospitals, stabbed in the street, beaten by masked gangs,  hung from meat hooks, thrown dead onto trash heaps, dismembered and mutilated.  They have had their bones broken, their cars set afire, their homes sacked.  </P> <P> Nationalist activists call these assaults "cleaning the Palestinian household."  As Palestinians see it, collaborators have sold out to an alien power. The  turncoats inform on neighborhood activities in return for money and privilege  -- a permit to build a house or acquire land, rights to water, permission to  travel. They act as intermediaries between Palestinians and the Israeli  government, greasing the bureaucratic machinery.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vulnerable to Blackmail  </P> <P> Disdainful Palestinians insist that many collaborators have criminal records  and are thus vulnerable to Israeli blackmail to keep prostitutes on the streets  and hashish on the market. Worst of all, in the eyes of some Palestinians, the  collaborators arrange deals that give away villages' communal land, which is  growing scarcer and scarcer.  </P> <P> Israeli officials say these charges amount to slander against "peace-loving  Arabs." The victims, they say, are guilty only of wanting to live in harmony  with their Jewish neighbors and of rejecting the uncompromising rhetoric of  anti-Israeli die-hards. Left to their own devices, they say, these peace-loving  Arabs would gladly accept Israel's offer of self-rule and get on with their  lives.  </P> <P> The use of collaborators has been an open secret since the founding of modern  Israel in 1948. Initially, informers were of paramount importance in  intelligence work. They let Israel know what was going on across the border in  the West Bank, which then belonged to Jordan, and the Gaza Strip, which was  under Egyptian control.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Petty Informers  </P> <P> Contacts took place at border points, where information was passed secretly  from Arab to Israeli. After the Six-Day War of 1967, in which Israel occupied  the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the network expanded to about 1,500 individuals.  Petty informers who spied on their neighbors' political activity and business  dealings were derisively called "shtinkers" by the Israelis.  </P> <P> Throughout the years, Israel has needed to keep a closer eye on West Bank  political trends. Who sympathized with the Palestine Liberation Organization?  With Jordan? With Syria?  </P> <P> Israel also began to buy up land, and there were widespread reports of  collaborators making money by signing forged contracts.  </P> <P> When the Arab uprising began in December, 1987, the drawbacks of relying on  informers became evident. Israeli officials admit that the popular revolt was  unexpected; years of investment in a spy network had proved next to fruitless.  At the same time, the need for information from the occupied lands multiplied.  </P> <P> Problems quickly arose. Many of the informers were already well known to their  neighbors. They were ostracized, threatened and eventually attacked. Some made  dramatic confessions at mosques. Others were driven off. More than 60 have been  killed. The well of information was drying up.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Threat of Revenge  </P> <P> Israeli military officials threatened to avenge attacks on informers and began  to carry out manhunts of Palestinian activists suspected of leading attacks on  collaborators. Some informers fled into Israel for protection, while others  took refuge on army bases and in police stations. Still others, like M., were  left to fend for themselves because they were not considered important enough  to protect.  </P> <P> "Suddenly, everyone pretended not to know me," M. said, recalling visits to his  police contacts for help.  </P> <P> M.'s troubles began 10 years ago, when he was working for the Jerusalem police.  In broad daylight he nabbed a purse snatcher in the Old City and turned him  over to the police. Immediately, M. became the target of threats.  </P> <P> "I was just helping to keep order," he said. "I don't feel I was some sort of  traitor."  </P> <P> He said a stipend from the police augmented the small salary he received as a  guard at a Jerusalem hospital.  </P> <P> One day, he was lifting weights at an Arab health club, where he was seen by a  Muslim cleric. When M. left, the cleric switched a light on and off. It was a  signal to assassins, he said.  </P> <P> At least two gunmen followed M. up a street. He noticed them and tried to run  away. Someone fired a shot, and M. was hit in the stomach. A resident answered  his pleas for help and took him to a hospital. M. survived multiple wounds from  a fragmentation bullet. The scars mark his belly in spirals.  </P> <P> He was haunted by the shooting, afraid the assassins would try again. His mind  was put to rest when, months later, the police called him and told him the  gunmen were in custody. They belonged to a militant vigilante group called  Islamic Sword. M. testified against them and they were sentenced to life in  prison.  </P> <P> "They begged me for mercy," he said. "But I couldn't sleep while they were at  large."  </P> <P> In 1985, Israel released about 1,200 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the  return of three Israeli soldiers held in Lebanon. Among them were the gunmen of  the Islamic Sword.  </P> <P> M. had gone back to informing, though he had little to offer because everyone  knew he worked for the Israelis. One day, while M. was carrying out undercover  watch duty near the Old City in Jerusalem, he encountered one of the bearded  gunmen. The man publicly swore to Allah that he would kill M.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, reports of collaborator executions began to increase. M. grew  fearful and went to the police for help. They told him they could do nothing.  </P> <P> Two months ago, M. was walking past the Damascus Gate, the door of the Old City  that leads directly into Arab East Jerusalem. Although he had grown a scruffy  beard and wore his kippa, someone recognized him.  </P> <P> "Luckily, there was a police van nearby and I ran to it," he said. "Otherwise,  I could have been attacked."  </P> <P> The incident frightened him.  </P> <P> M., who is 31, had heard that residents of Kiryat Arba had taken an interest in  the fate of collaborators, and he took refuge there. He is studying the Bible  and hoping to convert.  </P> <P> "I go to see the rabbis," he said. "They tell me to study more. They think I am  not sincere."  </P> <P> M. lives with his family in an apartment supplied by a resident of Kiryat Arba.  It is bare except for a few inexpensive decorations. One, a heart with  outstretched arms, bears the inscription, "I love you this much."  </P> <P> His oldest son also wears a kippa, speaks Hebrew and plays with Jewish  children. The others, and his wife, speak only Arabic.  </P> <P> Kiryat Arba stands on the fringe of Hebron, a Muslim city in the southern part  of the West Bank, and has been the scene of numerous clashes with Arabs living  in surrounding neighborhoods. The Israelis there consider themselves in the  vanguard of Jewish settlement and look on the Arabs as usurpers in a land  promised to the Jews by the Bible.  </P> <P> Recently, Kiryat Arba militants have campaigned in favor of protection for  collaborators. In Friday's issue of the newspaper Haaretz, settlement leader  Naom Arnon was quoted as saying: "We absorb them because they are in danger.  They were in danger because of connections with Israel, and the security organs  did not take responsibility for them."  </P> <P> Gush Emunim, a West Bank settler movement, has formed a group called Hand for a  Friend to rescue collaborators. Gush Emunim has taken in three families in  Kiryat Arba and several others elsewhere.  </P> <P> One family of refuge seekers from a village near Ramallah arrived a month ago.  All 13 members of the family, including five children, are trying to convert to  Judaism.  </P> <P> The family was suspicious of a reporter who visited them and said their rabbi  had forbidden them to talk. Haaretz said the family had been driven from their  village because of accusations that they cooperated with Israeli authorities.  One of the young male members of the family confided: "This is a secret matter.  I work for the Shin Bet."  </P> <P> Another told The Times: "Arabs who lived here were nothing when Jordan ruled.  We don't want to be like the rest of the Arab world and live under a  dictatorship. God willing, Israel will occupy all the Arab states."  </P> <P> He said that by converting to Judaism they will gain an added measure of  protection.  </P> <P> "Now when I walk into Hebron no one bothers me," he said. "They know where I  live and there would be trouble if they harmed me."  </P> <P> M. called on the family to share his religious lessons. He has taken on the  responsibility of helping them prepare for conversion, and he gave them a gold  paperback book of Talmudic studies. Some of the sons could read Hebrew, but the  father and children stared at the books blankly.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA Reporter Fu Gang (0265 0474) and RENMIN RIBAO </F> reporter Gong Wen (7895 7186)]    [Text] Beijing, 12 Apr (XINHUA) -- The State Council  Information Office today held a news conference for domestic and  foreign reporters, at which Liu Minxue, director of the State  Administration for Industry and Commerce, and Bai Dahua, deputy  director of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce  and director of the State Patent Office, were invited to brief  reporters on China's protection of the right to exclusive use of  trademarks registered by foreigners in China and to answer  reporters' questions.    Liu Minxue first briefed the Chinese and foreign reporters  on  China's trademark development. He said China has seen a sharp  rise in the number of valid registered trademarks over the last  decade. Registered trademarks topped 410,000 in China by the end  of 1993. Among them were 59,466 foreign trademarks, representing  a ten-fold increase over 1979. The sharp rise in the number of  foreign trademarks in China demonstrates the full confidence  that foreign businessmen have in China's protection of  intellectual property rights.    Answering a reporter's question on the specific regulations  and the steps that China has adopted and taken to protect the  right to exclusive use of trademarks, Liu Minxue gave the  following reply: First, the revised "Trademark Law" and its  "Implementation Rules" impose a heavy fine for those who violate  the Trademark Law, with the maximum fine as high as 50 percent  of the illegal business turnover. The National People's  Congress Standing Committee has also adopted the "Supplementary  Provisions on Punishing the Crime of the Production and Sale of  Fake and Shoddy Goods" and increased from three years to seven  years the prison term for those who commit the crime of  producing and selling fake and shoddy commodities. Second, to  protect the right of exclusive use of trademarks, administrative  management organs for industry and commerce, in addition to  handling trademark violation cases reported by trademark owners,  not only conduct market inspection on a regular basis but also  take the initiative in investigating trademark violation cases.  Third, both industry and commerce law enforcement departments  and justice departments may investigate trademark violation and  counterfeit trademark cases. People who feel their rights have  been violated may report to administrative management organs for  industry and commerce and may file charges against violators at  people's courts.    Replying to a reporter's question on China's special  stipulations on protecting the right of exclusive use of foreign  trademarks, Liu Minxue said that as China is one of the member  countries of the "Paris Convention on Protecting Industrial  Property Rights," it resolutely fulfills obligations as  stipulated in the "Paris Convention" and it has effectively  implemented the principle of giving foreigners equal treatment  as Chinese nationals in the area of trademark protection. China  not only protects the registered trademarks of its nationals, it  also gives equal treatment to foreigners who register trademarks  in China; in short, China protects the right of exclusive use of  trademarks according to law. But there is one thing that needs  to be explained. According to China's "Trademark Law,"  foreigners or foreign enterprises should go through an agency  designated by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce  to handle foreign affairs when they apply for trademark  registration or when they handle other trademark-related matters  in China.    When queried by a reporter on the infringement of  Microsoft's  rights in Shenzhen, Bai Dahua said that relevant departments are  now investigating this case and that Shenzhen's Industry and  Commerce Management Bureau has meted out punishment regarding  the trademark infringement issue. This case does not fall  within the scope of the readjustment of the "Trademark Law" as  it also touches on other issues in addition to trademark  infringement.    Asked how the Chinese trademark organs handle the problem of  "scrambling for trademark registration," Bai Dahua said as  China's "Trademark Mark Law" sets the "first come, first serve"  principle, China, therefore, excepting famous trademarks, does  not give special protection to trademarks of a general nature.  According to the "Paris Convention," special protection is given  to famous trademarks that are approved by a trademark  registration country or by a competent organ.</p>

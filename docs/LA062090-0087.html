			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAX HIKE FOR HEALTH PROGRAMS URGED;  </P> <P> STATE BUDGET: COUNTY OFFICIALS AND MEDICAL PROVIDERS SEEK TO PREVENT CUTS IN  WHAT THEY PERCEIVE AS AN ALREADY CRIPPLED SYSTEM. THEY MAKE THEIR APPEAL TO THE  GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATORS.  </P> <P> With final deliberations on a new state budget about to begin, county officials  and health-care providers began an intensive lobbying campaign Tuesday designed  to stave off cuts in what they call an already crippled health delivery system.  </P> <P> During a news conference at the Capitol, health officials urged Gov. George  Deukmejian and the Legislature to consider a tax increase, rather than program  cuts, to close a $3.6-billion revenue gap.  </P> <P> The press conference marked a stepped-up lobbying campaign by groups  representing a wide variety of people depending on the public health system,  from AIDS patients to the severely disabled. An annual ritual, the lobbying  campaign will last from now until the governor and Legislature agree on a  budget. A two-house budget conference committee will begin deliberations today  on rival versions of a $56-billion budget prepared by the Senate and Assembly.  </P> <P> With tax collections in the new budget year expected to run about $3.6 billion  below what it will take to finance state services at present levels, the  governor and lawmakers are debating whether to use budget cuts or tax  increases, or a combination of the two, to close the gap.  </P> <P> Dr. Gail Anderson, an emergency room physician at Los Angeles County-USC  Medical Center, said waiting lists at emergency rooms now are commonplace and  warned that any further cuts in state funds will be disastrous.  </P> <P> "We already are in trouble. . . . If we are cut any further we are going to  have to close down, we are going to have to close our doors," Anderson said.  </P> <P> Citing a proposal by Deukmejian to cut $150 million in county health funds,  health officials said counties would be forced to reduce scores of local  services.  </P> <P> They predicted that clinics would be closed and that services in jails,  children's hospitals and alcohol and drug abuse programs would be reduced. Some  counties would have to cut back on ambulance services, others would be forced  to eliminate or reduce programs for AIDS, nutrition, family services and  suicide intervention, the officials said.  </P> <P> "We are in a survival mode right now," said Dan Weisburd, president of the  California Alliance for the Mentally Ill.  </P> <P> Yolo County Supervisor Betsy Marchand, speaking for the County Supervisors  Assn. of California, said she and the others "support a tax increase," but did  not specify which taxes they would support raising.  </P> <P> Also appearing at the news conference was Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-San  Jose), chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, who earlier in the  day unveiled sketchy details of a budget-balancing plan that would raise $2  billion through tax increases and by speeding up tax collections. Most of the  money in the plan would be generated by raising the top rate of the personal  income tax from 9.3% to 11% for individual taxpayers earning $100,000 a year  and couples with taxable income of $200,000 or more.  </P> <P> In a related move, Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento) -- a member of  Assembly Speaker Willie Brown's inner circle -- proposed a budget-balancing  plan that would close the $3.6-billion gap by using a combination of budget  cuts, new taxes and adjustments in the tax code.  </P> <P> The plan would freeze cost-of-living increases for welfare recipients and the  aged, blind and disabled while also suspending indexing -- the law that  prevents taxpayers from being bumped into higher tax brackets when they get pay  raises equal to the increase in the cost of living. The proposal also would  strictly conform California's tax laws to the federal code, repeal the sales  tax exemption on candy and raise alcohol taxes.  </P></p>

Mr Phaithun told a press conference that he would continue  another 100-day operation plan, earlier proposed by Gen  Chawalit, to speed up administration at the ministry.    Gen Chawalit yesterday asked permission from the party  executive committee to appoint Mr Phaithun to succeed him at the  Labour and Social Welfare Ministry. He also received permission  to appoint or transfer party ministers before informing the  executive committee.    "In any case, I can talk to the Premier to transfer NAP  ministers without the advance permission of the executive  committee," said the NAP leader.    Gen Chawalit also told the press conference that the NAP  would cooperate with other coalition parties to improve the  efficiency of the government.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / New York City gets tough on smoking New York City took a big step yesterday towards enacting one of the country's toughest smoking bans, despite protests by the tobacco industry and restaurant owners, when the city council's health committee voted to approve the measures, Reuter reports from New York. Under the ban, smoking would be limited to the bar area in restaurants seating more than 35 people and nearly eliminated in office buildings. The measures, which the full city council is expected to approve on December 21, would also prohibit smoking at open-air sports arenas and zoos. Outdoor cafes would have to provide no-smoking areas. While other cities had stricter smoking curbs on restaurants and offices, it was the provisions on smoking outdoors that made the New York proposal so tough, the Tobacco Institute said. Philip Morris, the tobacco group, has hinted it would leave New York, where it has its headquarters, and cut its funding to the arts if the ban passed as originally drafted. Restaurateurs said the ban would cut their revenues and cited a survey showing the average restaurant expected an 8.1 per cent sales shortfall, representing a loss of 11,000 jobs and Dollars 27m in tax revenues.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Speaking on security guarantees  for the Russian peacekeeping contingent in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  Vitaliy Churkin said that regrettably there was no 100 percent  certainty on this score. According to him, the region where the  Russian battalion was carrying out its duties is one of the most  dangerous in Sarajevo. At the same time, the Russian diplomat  stressed that "every necessary step is being taken to create  political guarantees of security."    With regard to the possibility of increasing the Russian  contingent of peacekeeping troops, Vitaliy Churkin said that  "there is no immediate necessity for this to be done." However,  in his opinion, the need for additional peacekeeping forces will  certainly arise in the near future, when a peace agreement in  Bosnia-Herzegovina is reached.    The Russian diplomat believes that "there are still many  dangers in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There is no place for  euphoria. It is important not to lose momentum and get down to  political settlement. If there is no settlement, this  psychologically opportune moment can be lost and all sorts of  things might yet happen in Bosnia-Herzegovina."    In Vitaliy Churkin's opinion, there are no "fundamental  differences" in Russia's or NATO's approaches to the Bosnian  crisis. He stressed that now everybody understands that "the  Sarajevo experience cannot fully be transplanted to other  regions and hot spots in Bosnia and Herzegovina." At the Bonn  meeting, in particular, there were no calls for using strong arm  tactics. There was full understanding of the need for political  settlement.</p>

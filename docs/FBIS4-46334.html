			<p>Bomb  <H4>    Iran To Be Given Access to Suspects </H4>  <F P=102> BK0906065994 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 9 Jun 94 p 2 </F> <F P=103> BK0906065994 </F> <F P=104>  Bangkok BANGKOK POST </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN     [Excerpts] The Police Department will make arrangements for  Iranian diplomats to visit three Iranians arrested in Hat Yai  last week in connection with an attempt to car bomb the Israeli  Embassy in Bangkok in March.    The Police Department will also ensure that the three  suspects, now being detained at a police private training school  in Bang Khen, are in good condition. [passage omitted]    According to Pol Gen Phong-ammat, the U.S. Embassy in  Bangkok  has asked the Police Department for information about the  suspects.    Somchai Nilaphaichit, a representative of the Muslim Lawyer  Group, quoted the suspects as saying that they had no  involvement with the plot to attack the Israeli Embassy and that  they came to Thailand to do business.    Mr Somchai and Charan Malulin, a researcher at Chulalongkon  University, yesterday visited the three Iranians during which he  briefed them on Thai laws and the punishment they face if  convicted.    Mr Somchai said [suspect] Babak [Taheri] had allegedly told  him he was innocent and that the police had no evidence against  him.    He quoted Babak as saying that he would not have come back  to  Thailand if he really was involved in the foiled car-bomb plot.    [Suspect] Hossein [Shahriarifar], meanwhile, also denied  involvement, reportedly telling Mr Somchai that he entered  Thailand to extend his visa since he had a business concerning  the trade of radio and television sets here.    Hossein also denied reports that he had relations with a  Thai  woman, Mr Somchai said. [passage omitted]</p>

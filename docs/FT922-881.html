			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / French watchdog sinks teeth in government FRANCE'S official accounting watchdog, the Cour des Comptes, yesterday warned that public financial waste could not be curbed unless the government took more notice of its recommendations. The court could only be useful 'on condition that its conclusions. . . . are taken up actively by the government and parliament,' said Mr Pierre Arpaillange, the watchdog's president, in its annual report on inefficiencies in France's huge public sector. This is the first time the court has openly complained about being ignored. Court officials estimate less than a third of their suggestions lead to parliamentary action, well below the 95 per cent which their UK counterpart, the National Audit Office, says it achieves. 'The government has proclaimed its desire to fight corruption, so it should take our reports into account,' said Mr Arpaillange. If not, it should give reasons for rejecting them, he said. Among the 28 examples of inefficiency in the report are inadequate financial control of international co-operation accords by state-owned defence equipment suppliers, which absorbed FFr7.4bn (Pounds 750m) of French taxpayers' money in 1990. There is no central register of the 160 accords the court has managed to track down, nor any system of measuring performance, it says. The court also highlights alleged property frauds at the Institut de France state cultural academy; criticises marketing at Bull, the state-owned computer company; and highlights inefficiencies created by European farm subsidies. The study highlights several examples of alleged dishonesty in public health spending, including a private clinic which wrongly charged the government for FFr4.5m-worth of operations. Established in 1807, the court has wide investigative powers, but almost no policing authority. A committee of senior civil servants was set up in the 1970s to put pressure on ministers to act on the court's suggestions, but has not met for 10 years, say court officials. The government last year set up an interministerial committee to discuss the court's findings. It is due to meet for the first time later this year. SUCCESS on industrial export markets helped France record a FFr4.5bn (Pounds 450m) trade surplus in May, bringing the surplus over the previous 12 months to FFr9.4bn, the best result for 20 years. This is the fifth monthly surplus in a row and puts the trade account on track to break even or make a small surplus for the year, said Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, industry and foreign trade minister. He attributed the turnround, from a FFr30bn deficit for the whole of last year, to low inflation making French industrial goods competitive on export markets.</p>

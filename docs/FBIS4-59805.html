			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 18 (AFP)--More than 50 armed riot police  were deployed around the Saudi embassy in Tehran on Wednesday  [18 May] amid a row between the two countries over a ban on an  anti-US rally in Mecca, an AFP correspondent reported.    A police officer at the scene told AFP that the move was  taken at the request of Saudi authorities to protect the embassy  amid mounting tension between the two countries.    The police took up positions around the embassy and set up  road blocks on streets leading to the building.    Iran called off an anti-US and anti-Israel demonstration,  planned to be held by Iranian pilgrims in Mecca on Tuesday,  under the threat of force from the Saudis.</p>

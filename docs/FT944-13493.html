			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: After-care service of a quick sell - The industry's response to the mis-selling of pensions As estimates of the total bill facing the life insurance industry to compensate victims of poor advice to take personal pensions soar to Pounds 2bn, life companies are having to review their sums as well as their individual cases. Almost all life insurers have made some provision for possible pension compensation in their accounts for 1993, on the basis of how bad the extent of mis-selling looked last year. In its role as prudential supervisor, the Department of Trade and Industry wrote to life companies in January to check what provisions they had made. Now it is repeating the exercise, as the potential liability has grown sharply. The original cause for concern last December was a pilot study by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, suggesting that in nine out of 10 cases sales of personal pensions to people transferring a lump sum from an occupational scheme did not meet regulators' standards. Life companies emphasised that in many cases the advice would have been good though the record-keeping was poor, and played down the cost of compensating cases where a pension had been mis-sold. Now there seem to be two areas of business which were not previously thought to be a significant problem. Life insurers thought the number of cases where someone took a personal pension and left an employer's scheme to do so was relatively small, since there would clearly be a disadvantage to the investor in giving up the employer's contribution. They did not know how many had bought a private plan instead of joining an employer's scheme. A survey by actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow for the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, suggests about 300,000 people were advised to opt out of an occupational scheme and about 500,000 were advised not to join. Advice to take either course is more likely to have been poor than advice to take a pension transfer, and the cost of redress is likely to be higher. Identifying victims of mis-selling here will itself be an expensive task for life companies. There was little quarrelling from life companies yesterday about the prospect that they would have to make more provisions in the light of the new information. Only Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer, maintained that it did not need to make specific provision. Insurers emphasised, however, that the amounts of compensation likely to be payable by most companies were 'small change' in relation to their assets, and might have even less effect on policyholders and shareholders than poor investment performance or volatility in the markets. Legal &amp; General, one of the UK's largest life insurers, was the first to acknowledge it would have to raise provisions to take account of administrative costs and the prospect of contributing - through the Investors' Compensation Scheme - to redress for the clients of independent financial advisers which had gone out of business. Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society, the largest organisation to act as an independent adviser, said that having provided Pounds 5m already, it would be setting aside a further Pounds 5m. Others, however, took a different view. Pearl Assurance, for example, said it expected provisions to be 'a bit higher, but nothing like twice as much'. Similarly at BAT, which owns Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star, the expectation was that provisions would have to increase only slightly. Its earlier estimate for provisions across the two companies had been about Pounds 10m. It acknowledged, however, that it was in a somewhat unusual position because Allied Dunbar had professional indemnity insurance at Lloyd's, and the insurers had already been notified of a potential claim. The greatest concern seemed to be the unknown factors which could ultimately affect the amounts they would have to pay through the ICS. Mr Chris Brocksom, chief executive of AXA Equity &amp; Law, said that in making provisions last year it had taken little account of what it might have to pay for compensating clients of independent advisers no longer in business. Both he and Mr Philip Scott, life and pensions general manager at Norwich Union, highlighted how little information there was here. First, no one knows how many independent advisers will go out of business and so require the ICS to come into play. Second, it has not yet been decided how that ICS bill should be divided between life companies. For the year to March 31, it will be allocated on the current basis for sharing out the cost of compensation across the retail financial services sector. But most claims will come later and no arrangement has been made for how the bill should be divided then. Companies which do most business through independent advisers might have to pay more. With so much unresolved, the DTI letters may reach life companies this week but they are unlikely to get definite answers for many months to come.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Sharp criticises suppliers' pricing British electronics expertise is increasingly in demand at Sharp, the Japanese consumer electronics company, but it says that UK electronics manufacturers are still failing to reach world standards of price and performance. Mr Haruo Tsuji, Sharp president, said yesterday that collaboration between Sharp and UK software specialists on new word-processing systems had proved so successful that all future software development on the systems would be carried out in the UK. However, he said that for many components UK manufacturers were not competitive. Sharp buys in the UK about 35 per cent of the content of the microwave ovens, videotape recorders and electronic typewriters it manufactures at Wrexham, North Wales, but little of this is high-technology components. Sharp executives complain they are unable to buy supplies of even simple components - such as resistors - at a competitive price. Sharp has even installed metal-forming equipment to make cases for ovens and video recorders because of a high level of faults experienced with local components. Asked if Sharp would help develop a technological infrastructure in the UK to relieve the problem, Mr Tsuji said Sharp might produce more of the components in its own factories under its own quality control. He was in the UK to mark a Pounds 7m investment at the Wrexham plant which has created 200 new jobs in the area. It includes a new paint shop and integrated production lines.</p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / UN confirms Kurd refugee claims The Turkish government was yesterday criticised by Kurdish MPs, after the United Nations confirmed reports that several thousand Kurdish villagers had crossed the border into Iraq, in the wake of a heavy government onslaught against the separatist Kurdistan Workers party (PKK). Mr Selim Sadak, MP for Sirnak in Turkey's Kurdish heartland, writing to the interior minister, Mr Nahit Mentese, demanded a government investigation of allegations of bombing by Turkish military aircraft of Kurdish villages in which he claimed at least 48 people were killed. The government said earlier that a bomb had been dropped by accident. The incident underscores the violent escalation in the fighting, with more than 4,000 guerrillas, soldiers and civilians killed in the past year. The Turkish government has dismissed the situation as a PKK propaganda ploy. Foreign ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman vehemently denied eyewitness reports that villages were being deliberately targeted by security forces. The PKK has increased attacks against targets in western Turkey in recent months, including the killing of five off-duty Turkish army conscripts in Istanbul. The intensified conflict is causing concern in western capitals. The German foreign minister, Mr Klaus Kinkel, last week said the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe should convene a conference on the problem.</p>

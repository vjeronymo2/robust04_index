In  a statement made in Makhairas after a memorial service for  Grigorios Avxendiou, Kliridhis said that in his first report the  UN secretary general will not say much. He added that the  report will say that both sides have accepted the UN secretary  general's proposals in principle and will call on them to  intensify their efforts so that a way to implement the CBM's is  found.    Kliridhis said that Butrus-Ghali will attribute  responsibilities, if any, in his next report, which will be  submitted three weeks after the first one. Responding to a  question, the president said that he will not go to Athens now  because there is nothing new.</p>

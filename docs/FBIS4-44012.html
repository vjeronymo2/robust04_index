			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Peter Heinacher: "Where Are You Heading, </F> SPD?"]    [Text] Despite the confusion of its chancellor candidate  [Rudolf Scharping] on the subject of "better wage-earners" and  his bitter reaction to Roman Herzog's election to the presidency  and its poor performance at the European Parliament elections,  the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] has not given up.  Nevertheless, the SPD, which a few weeks ago still seemed a  sure winner of the Bundestag elections, is not in a good frame  of mind. But Rudolf Scharping succeeded in getting a tighter  hold of the reins in his passionate and militant speech at the  SPD congress, in which he attacked the Christian Democratic  Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU], although his speech did  not contain anything new. But the next few weeks will show  whether his speech will enable him to take the rudder of the  unwieldy SPD vessel and bring it back on course.    Scharping has obviously drawn conclusions from the internal  party criticism of his election campaign style in recent weeks.  He wants to proceed to the duel with Kohl with greater  militancy. He wants to avoid bad moves and take greater care  that his team plays a better game. He made it very clear in his  speech that he is prepared to accept a red-green alliance. That  is a clear blow to his opponents within the party, especially to  the Lower Saxon Minister-President Gerhard Schroeder. Scharping  knows he would lose potential voters in the political center if  there were a go-ahead to a coalition with the Greens. But what  choice does he have? A red-yellow-green coalition is out of the  question now that the liberals have placed their support in the  CDU/CSU. Therefore the only thing left to him is a grand  coalition, which officially he refuses to hear of. But there  are many indications that he will accept such a solution if the  Bundestag election dictates it, in view of the challenge posed  by German unity, the decreasing budget deficit, and the  difficult labor market situation. Obviously, another question  that concerns him is which of the two people's parties will  perform better at the elections.    There is no doubt that the CDU/CSU is experiencing an upward  turn right now. The chancellor is benefiting from the slow  economic recovery, mainly in the east. Kohl's calculations seem  to be proving right. However the road to the Bundestag  elections is still long. Within the next few months, Scharping  must demand more discipline from his comrades in arms; he made  an initial call for this discipline in Halle. When he succeeds  in guaranteeing order among his own ranks, his chances will  increase again. Next Sunday's Landtag elections in Lower Saxony  will provide the first indications of whether the population  considers the "message" of Halle as an encouragement or as empty  talk.</p>

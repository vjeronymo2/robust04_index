			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / FT Guide To The Week TUESDAY Dutch general election A closely-contested general election in the Netherlands sees the retirement from national politics of veteran prime minister Ruud Lubbers (left). Support for Mr Lubbers' Christian Democrats is forecast to fall by about half, and the party may be forced into opposition. The Labour Party, junior partners in the current coalition, also faces a severe electoral decline. Increased support for smaller parties will probably result in a three-party coalition. Bond hearing: The long-postponed public examination of Alan Bond, the failed Australian businessman, by his bankruptcy trustee begins. Two weeks ago, lawyers for the former tycoon withdrew a request for an adjournment until Mr Bond's mental state improved. They had previously argued he was severely depressed and his IQ had plummeted from 150 to 90 because of brain damage suffered during cardiac surgery. Contaminated land: Responses to the UK government's consultation paper on contaminated land, Paying for our Past, are due in today. The paper, which follows the government's scrapping of proposals for a register of contaminated land, calls for comments on the size of the problem and to determine who should foot the bill of cleaning land. Saleroom: Two weeks of big money spending in the art market start tonight in New York with a Christie's auction of contemporary art. 'Number 22', a painting by Jackson Pollock, created in 1949 by the dripping and pouring technique rather than the paint brush, is estimated at up to Dollars 3m, while Mark Rothko's atmospheric blur 'Four Reds' should make Dollars 1.8m. FT Survey: Romania. Japan's Golden Week: Japan is on its annual 10-day spring break, which ends on May 7. This year, an estimated 66.7m people are heading off on holiday, a record 450,000 of them abroad, attracted by the strength of the yen, which has made Haiwaii cheaper, for Japanese holidaymakers, than Hokkaido. Holidays: Japan (Constitution Day), Sri Lanka, Thailand. WEDNESDAY MID-EAST SIGNING CEREMONY Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation are due to sign an agreement granting limited Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. A ceremony is to be held in Cairo in the presence of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, Warren Christopher, US secretary of State, Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and Yassir Arafat, chairman of the PLO. The European Parliament, holding its last plenary session before the European elections, votes on the accession treaties of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Austria. It must approve the treaties by today to make entry on January 1 1995 possible. With many MEPs campaigning or not standing for re-election, worries are that not enough will show up to produce the 260 votes needed to gain an absolute majority out of the 518 seats. Australian White Paper: Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister (left), unveils the federal government's white paper on industry and employment. It will detail measures to address Australia's vexatious unemployment, along with regional development policy and help for Australian companies selling into Asian markets. The white paper's release comes a week before the federal budget statement, and Mr Keating's announcement is likely to pre-empt big expenditure items. South Korea's defence minister, Rhee Byoung-tae, arrives in Germany following a six-day visit to Russia, where he discussed the possible purchase of advanced weapons as payment for an outstanding Dollars 1.5bn loan that Seoul gave the former Soviet Union in 1991. He will be discussing possible arms purchases in Germany as well. Nigeria's long-heralded and oft-postponed 'war against indiscipline and corruption' is scheduled to begin. Saleroom: The highlight of Sotheby's auction of contemporary art in New York tonight is 'Highway' by Jasper Johns. Inspired by the artist's experience of driving on a New York highway at night, this blur of reds, blues and yellows is estimated at a hefty Dollars 8m, showing a return of confidence to this section of the art market. Football: In the European Cup Winners' Cup Final, England's Arsenal play Italy's Parma in Copenhagen. FT Surveys: Restructuring Eastern Germany and Greater Philadelphia. Holidays: Japan, Russia (Orthodox Easter). THURSDAY Local elections in Britain England, Wales and Scotland vote in local elections that will determine whether the Conservative party remains a force in local government and - no less importantly - whether John Major is likely to face a leadership challenge from disaffected Tory MPs later this year. Elections are being held for metropolitan and shire councils, but attention will focus on the results in outer London, where the Tories have traditionally been dominant. Palestinian police force: The ending of more than a quarter-century of Israeli occupation begins, as Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho see the deployment of their own police force. An advance guard of 1,000 Palestinian police will cross into Gaza and Jericho to begin to take over security from the departing Israeli army. Israel is expected to complete its military withdrawal and the transfer of civilian administration to the PLO within a maximum of three weeks. Tsutomu Hata, Japan's prime minister, on a trip to Western Europe originally organised for his predecessor, visits Germany. He meets Chancellor Kohl, Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, and Johannes Rau, prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, where the city of Dusseldorf is home to the largest concentration of Japanese in Germany. Beirut renewal: Shareholders of Solidere, the Dollars 1.8bn company that plans to rebuild central Beirut, hold their second meeting to incorporate the company. The Badminton Horse Trials, England's premier equestrian event begin at Badminton House, Avon (to May 8). Savoury tooth: The British Association for Toothfriendly Sweets launches its campaign in London. FT Surveys: International Corporate Finance and FT Exporter. Holidays: Japan, South Korea (Children's Day), Mexico, Thailand (Coronation Day). FRIDAY Channel Tunnel 'opening' Today sees the official inauguration of the Channel Tunnel. However, more than a year behind schedule and more than twice the original budget, it will not actually open to passengers until at least the autumn. In the morning, the Queen opens the Waterloo International rail terminal in London (below), while in Paris President Francois Mitterrand opens a terminal at Gard du Nord. Both will then take Eurostar trains to Calais for an opening ceremony. The Queen and President Mitterrand will then drive, in her Rolls Royce, on to a vehicle shuttle and head through the 55km tunnel to Folkestone for more ceremony on the British side. South Africa's president is due to be elected by the National Assembly. The president, almost certain to be Nelson Mandela, will be sworn in on May 10 in Pretoria. Ethnic Armenian separatists in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh enclave in Azerbaijan have accepted Russian proposals for a cease-fire starting today. Hong Kong: Lu Ping, Beijing's top official on Hong Kong affairs, is expected to lift the veil on China's policy towards the colony, when he addresses a lunch sponsored by the combined chambers of commerce in Hong Kong. Making his first visit since Chris Patten became governor, Mr Lu is expected to indicate how Beijing will deal with Britain on 'non-political' matters arising from the transfer of sovereignty in 1997. Bilateral co-operation on political development collapsed last year. Since then, there have been signs that Beijing is prepared to discuss economic matters. East Timor: Indonesia and Portuguese foreign ministers meet for United Nations-sponsored talks on the former Portuguese colony, annexed by Indonesia in 1975, a move not recognised by the UN. The UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali is expected to attend. Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister holds a meeting with his Austrian and Swiss counterparts in Munich. Among the items on the agenda will doubtless be how to plan co-operation with Austria in and Switzerland outside the European Union. FT Surveys: Madeira and The Channel Tunnel. SATURDAY Hata returns to Japan Tsutomu Hata, Japan's prime minister, returns to problems at home after a trip to Europe. The aim was to strengthen relations before the Naples summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in July. Last week, the Socialists, the biggest party in the ruling alliance, dropped out of the coalition, depriving it of a parliamentary majority. Hata's minority government is likely to be shortlived. Vietnam celebrates the 40th anniversary of the battle of Dien Bien Phu, which ended nearly a century of French colonial rule. Time warp: British and French vintage cars, taking part in a rally from London to Paris to mark the Channel tunnel inauguration, will travel through it by shuttle. Under fours: A special handicap mile at the Iffley Road track in Oxford is part of the celebrations of Roger Bannister's breaking of the four-minute barrier there in 1954. The Kentucky Derby is run at the Churchill Downs course, Louisville. SUNDAY Panamanian elections Five years after the US invasion, the presidential candidate for the party of General Manuel Noriega is going into the election as favourite. Ernesto Perez Balladares of the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) leads the polls. His nearest challenger is the lawyer-actor-salsa singer, Ruben Blades, who heads a new green-leaning political movement Papa Egoro (Mother Earth in a local indian language). Costa Rican presidency: Jose Mara Figueres, the son of 'Pepe' Figueres, the popular former president who dominated Costa Rican politics for two decades, assumes the presidency. Mr Figueres has pledged to place a greater emphasis on social issues than the outgoing government. Hungary holds the first round of parliamentary elections. The second round is due to be held on May 29. Sumo-time: The 15-day Grand Summer Sumo Tournament starts in Tokyo. Compiled by Patrick Stiles. Fax: (+44) (0)71 873 3194.</p>

They cordially held a forum with Fang Zuqi,  political commissar of the Nanjing Military Region, and other  leading comrades in which they happily reviewed the Army's  friendship with the government and the people and jointly  discussed matters of vital importance on double-support work.    During the forum, Comrades Wu Bangguo and Huang Ju first  extended New Year's greetings to the leaders of the Nanjing  Military Region on behalf of the Shanghai municipal party  committee, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the people of  Shanghai. They also extended season's greetings to all  commanders and fighters in the military region. After giving a  briefing on economic construction and spiritual civilization in  Shanghai Municipality, Comrade Wu Bangguo said: Under the  leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang  Zemin at the core, the people of Shanghai have proceeded  simultaneously in economic construction and spiritual  civilization in accordance with the party Central Committee's  directive on carrying out both tasks simultaneously and paying  equal attention to both. They have made every effort to ensure  success in both tasks. Troops in the Nanjing Military Region,  especially those stationed in Shanghai, have contributed  tremendously to promoting the two civilizations. Last year, the  Shanghai municipal party committee and the Shanghai Municipal  Government launched commemorative activities on the 30th  anniversary of the naming of the "Good 8th Company on Nanjing  Road," viewing such activities as an important measure for  promoting socialist spiritual civilization. Such activities  played an excellent role in inspiring a hard-working spirit  among the people of Shanghai and in advancing the two  civilizations. Partly because of soldiers' contributions,  Shanghai has made fairly rapid progress in economic construction  and spiritual civilization over the past two years. Just as the  song "The Moon on the 15th of the Lunar Month" goes, your feats  take up half the chapter of military exploits. On behalf of the  Shanghai municipal party committee, the Shanghai Municipal  Government, and the people of Shanghai, I would like to express  my heartfelt gratitude to the commanders and fighters in the  Nanjing Military Region.    Comrade Huang Ju said: Army units have supported the most  difficult tasks during the most difficult periods in Shanghai's  economic construction. Commanders and fighters were among those  undertaking difficult tasks, such as blowing up the dam in the  Taipu He to release the water, expanding the Yanggao Road, and  building the Yangpu and Nanpu Bridges. Shanghai Municipality  has a fine double-support tradition, which we should inherit and  carry forward in the interest of greater unity between the Army  and the government and between the Army and the people.    On behalf of party committees, government departments, and  all commanders and fighters in the Nanjing Military Region,  Comrade Fang Zuqi expressed heartfelt thanks to the leaders of  the Shanghai municipal party committee and the Shanghai  Municipal Government, as well as to all people in Shanghai, for  their concern and support for Army building. He said: It was  very heartening to see Comrades Xiaoping and Chen Yun in very  good health [fei chang jian kang 7236 1603 0256 1660] on the  television newscast featuring Shanghai municipal party and  government leaders offering New Year's greetings to them. On  behalf of commanders and fighters in the entire military region,  please extend our regards to Comrades Xiaoping and Chen Yun and  wish them long lives. This is the greatest wish of the vast  numbers of commanders and fighters. Comrade Xiaoping spoke  highly of Shanghai's work, and we were very glad to hear that.  Shanghai Municipality has not only developed rapidly in the  economic field but has also made phenomenal gains in  double-support work. National defense education has been  legislated in Shanghai. Activities launched by Comrade Jiang  Zemin while he worked in Shanghai to encourage leading cadres to  "spend a day in military barracks" have not only been  institutionalized but have also expanded to include  entrepreneurs, teachers, students, non-CPC people, and the broad  masses. These activities have become an important means for  conducting mass education on national defense. Shanghai  Municipality has actively taken various measures to solve  practical problems and render practical service to troops, such  as resettling demobilized and retired soldiers, helping military  dependents settle down and seek jobs, helping soldiers' children  enroll in kindergartens and schools, assisting troops in  training dual-purpose personnel, and improving logistical  operations. It has done a great deal of useful work in this  respect. Improved double-support work has greatly benefited  military units. We are keenly aware that difficulties, however  formidable, will not unnerve us, given the party's correct  leadership, the worthy masses, and the Army's good relationship  with the government and the people. It is the sacred duty of  the People's Army to defend and build the motherland. We are  duty-bound to carry out the large-scale construction of  Shanghai. From now on, we should continue to do more work, and  the Army and the people should work together to further defend  Shanghai and carry out the large-scale construction of Shanghai.    Leaders from the Nanjing Military Region, Shanghai  Municipality, and relevant departments attending the forum  included Yan Zhuo, Xie Decai, Wang Yongming, Lan Baojing, Chen  Bingde, Wang Tongzhuo, Wang Chuanwu [3769 0278 2976], Sui  Shengwu, Xu Wenyi, and Zhou Yupeng.    Prior to the forum, Wu Bangguo, Huang Ju, and other leading  comrades from Shanghai Municipality braved the rain to call on  veteran comrades in the Nanjing Military Region, such as  Comrades Du Ping, Xiang Shouzhi, Fu Kuiqing, and Liu Anyuan, in  the company of Lan Baojing, deputy political commissar of the  Nanjing Military Region. They extended New Year's greetings to  the veteran comrades, wishing them good health, long lives, and  a happy New Year.</p>

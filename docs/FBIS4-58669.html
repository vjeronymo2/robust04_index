			<p>BFN     [Text] Riyadh, 5 May -- A responsible source has made the  following statement: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is following  with great sorrow the continuing fighting between the brothers  in brotherly Yemen. In the interests of the brothers in Yemen,  the kingdom calls on all to show self-control, stop the  fighting, let rationality and logic reign, and place the  interests of Yemen above any other consideration to preserve the  blood and souls of its sons. The kingdom is prompted into making  this appeal by the hope that the true Islamic and patriotic  spirit will prevail to halt these bloody events and calls on God  the almighty and all-powerful to prevent every misfortune and  adversity in brotherly Yemen.</p>

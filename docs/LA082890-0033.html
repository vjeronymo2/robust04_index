			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> JOE MORRIS EXPECTED TO BE AMONG 11 GIANT CUTS  </P> <P> A source within the New York Giants organization said that running back Joe  Morris will be among the 11 players the team will release today to reach the  60-man roster limit.  </P> <P> "They're going to cut Joe Tuesday," said the source, who asked not to be  identified.  </P> <P> Although there was no official confirmation from the Giants, Bill Parcells  indicated Sunday that he was close to making a decision about his running  backs. "I want to talk to my coaches first," he said. Morris could not be  reached for comment Sunday.  </P> <P> Morris, 29, is the club's all-time leading rusher with 5,296 yards and 48  touchdowns. But he missed all of last season with a broken foot and hasn't had  an impressive camp. He has rushed 20 times for 47 yards, an average of just 2.3  yards a carry. Many of his rushes have been behind the second-team offensive  line.  </P> <P> Parcells said that his decision at running back is not just a matter of whom  he'll keep but also how he'll use them. "Do I have one starter and use him the  majority of the time? Or do I have enough talent now that I'm going to use two  or three guys (at halfback)? Right now it looks like we might use more than one  on a weekly basis. Some of those kids have a lot of ability."  </P> <P> It is unclear whether Ottis Anderson will survive the cut. He has rushed for 31  yards on 14 carries, a 2.2 average. Youngsters Rodney Hampton (15-141) and  Lewis Tillman (15-67) have been more impressive.  </P> <P> It's doubtful seventh-round pick Aaron Emanuel will make the club. His injured  shoulder is a condition that has plagued him since college. Parcells is  apprehensive about playing Emanuel. "I don't know what I'm going to do with  him," the coach said.  </P> <P> Although the Giants beat the Jets, 17-7, Saturday night, Parcells was so  troubled by the early performance of his offensive line that he summoned the  unit to Giants Stadium Sunday to "get this straightened out one way or  another."  </P> <P> While the rest of the team had a day off, Parcells had his linemen watch  videotapes of their performance, which included four sacks allowed, holding  penalties on Jumbo Elliott, William Roberts and Bart Oates, and two false  starts. Parcells said his line's play was "not only disturbing, it's a little  bit alarming."  </P> <P> "They weren't ready to go. They weren't alert," he said. "The Jets ran by them  early in the game. And penalties ... penalties are the players' fault. I don't  take the blame for any penalties except for delay of game. They know what the  rules are. They know they're not supposed to hold."  </P> <P> To get his point across, Parcells did something he hasn't done in six years --  call a particular group of players in on their day off. His reasoning: "They're  not going to like to sit in there and watch the film with the rest of the  offense, so we'll do it quietly and try to get everything resolved."  </P> <P> Two Giants who excelled Saturday night were defensive back Reyna Thompson and  linebacker Pepper Johnson. Thompson made two tackles on punt coverage and  showed some grit by getting into two scuffles with Jets safety Erik McMillan.  "He's a one-man gang," Parcells said. "He's absolutely the best special-teams  player I've ever had. They made him mad (Saturday) night. He's the wrong guy to  make mad."  </P> <P> Thompson was annoyed with himself, because dueling with McMillan cost him a  chance to make another tackle on punt coverage. "I played stupid," Thompson  said. "I'm trying to get physical and play rough and tough with him and show  him what Reyna's all about, and I didn't make the play. From now on, I'll go  down there and make the play, then show him what Reyna's all about."  </P> <P> Johnson, meanwhile, likes the new scheme in which he rushes the quarterback. He  collected two sacks against the Jets and thinks he can get plenty more during  the season. "If they keep me out there rushing like that, I think I can sneak  into double digits this year," said Johnson, who has eight sacks in four  seasons with the Giants.  </P> <P> Carl Banks on the Giants' defense, which has allowed just 23 points in three  preseason victories: "It's promising as long as we continue to execute. We're  not a gambling type of defense, so we have to rely on consistency and hard  work. If we do that, we'll have a good defense."  </P></p>

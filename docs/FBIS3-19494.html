Frustrated British officials admitted yesterday that India  was no nearer a decision, despite reports that the deal-worth up  to 1bn [trillion] pounds -- might be finalised during the visit  of Narasimha Rao. "Would that it were true," said one official.  "We'd like to say that it is true. But the evaluation process  in India is some way from completion."    Indian sources made clear that Britain could not take for  granted a deal -- expected to be for 66 aircraft -- because of  any loyalty India might feel towards its former colonial rulers.  They said Britain was desperate to win the contract because  thousands of jobs depended on it and because of the Pergau dam  trade-for-arms debacle, which led Malaysia to scrap defence  purchases. But, one Indian source added: "Pressure won't work."    British officials insisted that they had not realistically  expected the deal to be finalised during the Rao visit. New  Delhi's slow and deliberate approach was both an expression of  Mr Rao's natural reluctance to be rushed into any decision and  of the "new and mature" Anglo-Indian relationship, whereby India  would make an objective choice about the best aircraft at the  lowest price.    On a visit to India 14 months ago John Major took a  representative of British Aerospace [BAe] to lobby for the deal.  As one Indian source said: "Pressure did not work then and it  will not work now."    An order would help to safeguard jobs at BAe's plants at  Brough, Humberside and Warton, Lancashire, and provide business  for suppliers such as Rolls-Royce. The rival French bid is for  Alpha jets, made by Dassault-Dornier. One official said the  problem was largely that the Indians were faced with almost  "identical products at the same price."    Indian press reports say the Hawk deal has already been  recommended by Indian Air Force experts. Some sources suggested  New Delhi was spinning out the contest because of what it  perceived as lack of political support from Britain over issues  such as Kashmir. "If India gives them this contract there is  nothing left in its armoury," said one.    The Indian decision-making process goes back a number of  years. "First there was the technical problem of whether they  could design and build their own planes," said one British  official. "They decided not to. Then there was the decision as  to what kind of plane to buy from abroad. Then there was the  question of whether there is enough money in the budget. And  Manmohan Singh (the Finance Minister) cares a lot about the  budget deficit."    British officials admit Mr Singh is "an effective operator"  and say their faith in the successful liberalisation of the  Indian economy rests largely on his competence.    During Mr Rao's visit, General Electric signed a memorandum  of understanding on a 1bn [trillion] pound deal to build a power  station in Maharashtra state. British officials brushed aside  any parallels with the Pergau dam: "You'd be hard pressed to  get Pergau into this," one said. "It is not a dam; and the aid  budget for India has been stable for a number of years. We'd  dearly love to sell arms to the Indians, but it is not a case of  aid for trade."</p>

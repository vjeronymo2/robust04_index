			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (f) of the current rule would be removed because fees for trailing livestock would be included in proposed paragraph (e). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (g) of the current rule would be redesignated as paragraph (f) in the proposed rule and remain unchanged. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (h) of the current rule would be removed because charges for unauthorized use are not part of the grazing fee system, but are penalties that are more appropriately addressed in the proposed revision of the rules in subpart A. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraphs (i) and (j) would be redesignated as paragraphs (g) and (h) and retained without change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (k) of the current rule would be removed because it describes beef cattle price data that would not be used for determining fees under the proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 222.51_Grazing Fees in the Western States <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current Section 222.51 would be revised in its entirety. The heading would be revised to read: Grazing fees in the Western States. This revision proposes a new system for determining grazing fees which would be implemented in 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The areas subject to the new fee system would be revised to include all of the national grasslands. Historically, the national grasslands have been subject to a different fee system than the one used for national forests. In 1992, the Secretary of Agriculture reduced the national grasslands grazing fee to an amount commensurate with the national forest grazing fee. The proposed rule would incorporate this change so that the grazing fee on national grasslands would be the same as the fee charged for livestock grazing on other National Forest System lands in the Western States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In selecting a revised fee system, the Forest Service and BLM established several criteria that a proposed fee system should meet. Those criteria are: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The fee charged for livestock grazing should approximate market value. Using the market value helps assure that the public receives a fair return for the private use of publicly owned resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The fee charged should not cause unreasonable impacts on livestock operations that are heavily dependent on public forage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The fee charged should recover a reasonable amount of the government's cost involved in administering grazing permits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The fee charged should provide increased funds to improve rangeland resource conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The fee system should be understandable and relatively inexpensive to administer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The present fee system, in effect since 1978, has been criticized for contributing to the wide disparity between charges for livestock grazing on private lands compared to charges for livestock grazing on Federal lands. While the forage value in the private market has increased substantially over time, the Federal grazing fee has decreased during some seasons or had relatively small increases. The proposed grazing fee system would address the failure of the existing grazing fee system to adequately reflect private grazing land market conditions. The proposed fee system would include a base value which considers the cost differences of operating on public lands as compared to private lands, as well as appraisal data, annually adjusting the fee in proportion to changes in private grazing land lease rates (PGLLR). After an initial phase-in period, the fee would be adjusted annually by multiplying the base value by the forage value index (FVI), which reflects the change in PGLLR for the 17 Western States, using the weighted average AUM price in each State. The PGLLR estimate is prepared annually by the USDA, National Agricultural Statistical Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of the public input gained following the ANPR and through the scoping process for the environmental analysis of ``Rangeland Reform '94'', the Departments of Agriculture and Interior determined that the grazing fee system proposed initially represents a reasonable and equitable method for calculating the fee. However, change in FVI is proposed and a provision for incentive-based fee adjustment has been added. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed fee would be phased in over the years 1995 through 1997. Thereafter, annual increases or decreases in the grazing fee resulting from changes in the FVI would be limited to 25 percent of the amount charged the previous year to minimize impact of fee increases on ranch operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A base value of $3.96 per animal unit month (AUM) is proposed in this rule. This value represents the average of the results obtained through the use of two methods discussed below for estimating a fair base value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first method is the 1966 Western Livestock Grazing Survey (WLGS), where over 10,000 individuals were interviewed to determine the costs of operating on federal lands and the relationship of public land grazing use to the PGLLR. The WLGS determined the 1966 11-State value for grazing federal lands to be $1.23 per AUM. This value is updated to a 1991 AUM base value of $3.25, which is determined by multiplying $1.23 by 265, the percentage change in the PGLLR from the base years 1964&hyph;1968, and dividing by 100. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Inflation data boosts long-dated UK gilts Good news on the inflation front provided the UK government bond market with an excuse to climb still higher yesterday, with long-dated gilts gaining up to half a point at one stage and leaving the market a quarter point higher on the day. However, the release of strong retail sales figures dampened hopes of an imminent cut in the base rate, leaving the short end of the market unchanged or slightly lower on the day. The November inflation data was better than expected. It left the annual rate unchanged at 1.4 per cent but depressed the underlying rate (excluding mortgage interest) to 2.5 per cent year-on-year, down from 2.8 per cent in October. Gilts rallied on the news, but slipped back later on to close a quarter point higher at the long end. Retail sales figures for November were stronger than expected, and the healthy consumer spending pattern led the market to tone down its hopes of a near-term rate cut. The main European government bond markets yesterday appeared to have recovered from the shock of the Russian election results and generally ended higher on the day. After a tumultuous day on Tuesday, bunds recovered yesterday with dealers stressing that the market had earlier over-reacted. The main news was the announcement of a new 30-year Federal bond issue, details of which will be revealed on December 28. The existing ultra-long Federal issue underperformed the rest of the market on the news. Market participants will be waiting to see the outcome of today's Bundesbank council meeting and ensuing press conference at which the central bank will announce its 1994 money supply growth target. Dealers said they expect the target range to stay unchanged at 4.5 to 6.5 per cent. Spanish government bonds edged up on foreign buying ahead of the release of inflation figures yesterday, and the market ended firmer across the yield curve. Although the year-on-year inflation figure edged up to 4.7 per cent last month from 4.6 per cent in October, dealers said the figure was in line with expectations and that the market paid closer attention to underlying inflation, which showed a rise of 5 per cent, against 5.3 per cent in October. Among the other high-yielding markets, Italian government bonds gained on hopes of a cut in interest rates and expectations that the 1994 budget will be approved shortly. At yesterday's auction of a further L1,500bn of Italy's 30-year bond, dealers said demand was 'pretty good', giving a cover ratio of about 1.6 times, while the net yield on the bond has fallen to 8.25 per cent from 8.62 per cent when the first tranche was sold. The US Treasury market finished on a firmer note yesterday in a volatile session which weathered further evidence of economic expansion and a sharp turnround in gold prices. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was  1/32 higher at 99 1/2 , to yield 6.282 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was 3/32 ahead at 100 3/32 , yielding 4.182 per cent. The market took in its stride reports reinforcing the impression of strong growth in the manufacturing sector. In its biggest jump of the year, November industrial production jumped 0.9 per cent, compared with forecasts of about 0.6 per cent and a revised October rise of 0.7 per cent. Capacity utilisation rose 0.6 points to 83 per cent, the highest since August 1989. The muted response suggested that the news had already been factored into the inflation-sensitive long end. Declining Comex gold futures provided further support. By midday, the long bond was posting moderate gains. Later, gold prices reversed course and finished 40 cents up on the day, pushing the 30-year issue in the opposite direction. However, the long bond see-sawed back into positive territory near the end of the session, with the price swing exaggerated by the thin level of trading. Bonds with shorter maturities edged higher on the announcement that the Treasury would not increase the size of next week's monthly auction of two-year and five-year notes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jordan and Israel Tuesday [7 June] signed three  documents detailing the agenda of negotiations that will lead to  the signing of a peace treaty. Official sources in Amman said  the two countries next month will start working out a peace  agreement after having formed a committee to demarcate their  joint borders.    In a statement to our radio, a spokesman for the unified  leadership of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of  Palestine [DFLP] and the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine [PFLP] said the unified leadership of the two fronts  has warned against the dangers of the Jordanian-Israeli  agreement and said it opens the door wide for all forms of  normalization at a time when Israel is still occupying the  Palestinian and Arab territories, in addition to the fact that  it is a violation of the principle of a comprehensive solution  in accordance with international legitimacy, although it is  hiding behind the first penetration represented by the  Oslo-Cairo agreement.    The central leadership of the two fronts warned against this  agreement and called on the Jordanian House of Representatives  and all national Jordanian forces, parties, and personalities to  reject the agreement and not to allow it to pass on both the  popular and official levels. The leadership also demanded that  the Jordanian Government revoke this agreement and abide by the  principle of comprehensive solution and the constants of the  pan-Arab position, according to the PFLP and DFLP spokesman.</p>

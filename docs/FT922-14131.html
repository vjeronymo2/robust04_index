			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TRADING in the derivatives market continued to be dominated by hedging as traders tried to second guess the outcome of tomorrow's election, writes Joel Kibazo. In stock index futures, the June contract on the FTSE was traded at a healthy premium of 25 at the beginning of the session. But an early rise was cut short by sellers, mostly independent traders as the large institutions once again remained on the sidelines and June soon fell back to 2,422. A brief rally, as several US houses went bargain hunting, was cut short by a poor Wall Street opening. Further falls were recorded towards the close as sizeable selling in the traded options was hedged in the futures market. June closed at 2,428, down 14 on the previous session and around two points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of 22. Turnover reached 6,590 contracts. In trade options, turnover returned to a more modest 24,466, down from 29,698 on Monday. Strong hedging business caused the FTSE option's daily total to rise to 12,028 contracts. Among the stock options, Midland Bank led the way with a day's total of 1,433 lots, followed by GEC at 1,135 lots.</p>

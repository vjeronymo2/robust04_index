			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Survey of Malaysia (5): Splits appear in Umno as its opponents coalesce - Politics, Dr Mahathir presides over a delicate structure ON ONE level, politics in Malaysia is all about one man. After more than 10 years in power, Dr Mahathir Mohamad dominates the scene. A generally passive media quotes his every word, the first items on the nightly television news more often than not being devoted to Dr Mahathir's activities. But Dr Mahathir presides over a delicate and at times shaky political structure. There are divisions within his United Malays National Organisation (Umno). Partners in the prime minister's National Front government, though electorally weak, have to be constantly mollified and appeased. The opposition shows signs of greater unity and, perhaps the most precarious element of all in present day Malaysian politics, the government is embroiled in increasingly bitter federal-state arguments with the opposition-governed states of Kelantan and Sabah. Umno has dominated Malaysian politics since the days of independence from Britain. But there have been frequent splits within the organisation, and in 1987 Dr Mahathir was forced to form the present Umno Baru party, or New Umno, after an attempted party putsch against his leadership and a court ruling against the legality of the old party structure. Umno represents the Malays, who make up more than than half of Malaysia's 18.5m population. Umno MPs are very dependent on continued support in their home states, and have to echo views which at times run contrary to government policy. Some states, particularly the more conservative northern ones, want a greater Umno commitment to moves towards a more Islamic society. There is concern within some sections of Umno about the new direction in government economic policy, with less emphasis now being given to the spread of wealth as a natural right among the Bumiputra, or Malay, community. At times, Umno bickering intrudes into international affairs: a recent quarrel with Singapore about ownership of an island off the southern state of Johor was seen by some as an attempt by dissident Umno elements in Johor to embarrass Dr Mahathir, rather than a Kuala Lumpur-Singapore clash. In the last elections, in late 1990, the National Front's share of the vote dropped from 57 to 52 per cent, but it still has 127 of the 180 seats in the lower house of parliament. Umno politicians hold the important cabinet positions. The Malaysian Chinese Association, one of the main National Front partners, is still tainted with past corruption charges, and has failed to capture the hearts and minds of the majority of Malaysia's 30 per cent Chinese community. The Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC), another coalition partner, seems to lurch from one scandal to another. Mr S Samy Vellu, the MIC leader and minister of energy, telecommunications and posts in Dr Mahathir's government, was last month asked by the country's anti corruption agency to provide details of his financial assets, following investigations into the misappropriation of 9m shares in Telekom Malaysia, the country's second biggest listed company. In recent weeks MPs have listened to a number of allegations by the opposition that another leading MIC member and former parliamentary deputy speaker has been involved in various group sex exploits. The opposition has attacked government for what it regards as its unwillingness to tackle corruption and its increasingly high handed approach. Mr Lim Kit Siang, leader of the opposition Democratic Action Party (DAP) says there is an increasingly 'anti-democratic trend' in Malaysia. Mr Razaleigh Hamzah, once a close colleague of Dr Mahathir but now heading a rival political party to Umno, has launched a broadside against the government's industrialisation policy, saying that it will only lessen the role of the Malays in the economic life of the country - a claim dismissed as 'rubbish' by the government. Some of the opposition groups have recently formed a coalition: while an increased show of unity might make attacks on the government more effective, the opposition is hampered by the apparent unwillingness of the media to give detailed coverage to anti-government views. The opposition is also up against the enormous financial resources of Umno, mostly derived from the party's involvement in a myriad of business conglomerates and enterprises. The federal-state battle is of greater concern to Dr Mahathir's government. In the 1990 elections, the state of Kelantan, on the east coast of peninsula Malaysia, voted out Umno and in Parti Islam Malaysia (PAS). Kelantan is the most Islamic of the Malaysian states, with more than 90 per cent of the population Moslem. Umno sees itself as the representative of Malay - by extension Moslem - values and traditions. PAS, which emphasises the need for more thorough Islamisation, is seen as a leading threat to Umno. Dr Mahathir makes no secret of his anger that the people of Kelantan have chosen PAS instead of Umno. Investors are shying away from Kelantan because it is controlled by an opposition party, says the government. It says that attempts by the Kelantan government to implement 'Hukum Hudud', the traditional Islamic penal code which can mean the stoning of adulterers and the amputation of the hands of thieves, will only mean that Kelantan will become less developed. The Kelantan authorities accuse the federal government of withholding development funds in order to punish the state for voting against Umno. In the state of Sabah, in East Malaysia, the situation is more complex. The principal political party in the state, the Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS), is multi-racial, mainly representing Sabah's diverse native peoples. PBS was formerly part of the National Front government, and Umno did not involve itself in Sabah's politics. But this changed in the elections of 1990, when the PBS decided to leave the coalition and support the rival Umno group, led by Mr Razaleigh. Following this, Umno moved into Sabah and launched a membership drive among the native peoples, who in official parlance are also referred to as Bumiputras, though most are not Malays. The PBS, which still controls Sabah's administration, accuses Umno of importing its own racially-based politics into the state and threatening stability. The government has brought corruption charges against Mr Joseph Pairin Kitingan, head of the PBS and Sabah's chief minister. Mr Pairin's brother has been detained under Malaysia's Internal Security Act, suspected of plotting to have Sabah opt out of the Malaysian Federation. Echoing the accusations of Kelantan, Sabah says Kuala Lumpur is punishing it for not obeying Umno edicts and is hindering its development. These political issues are manifesting themselves at a time of considerable change in Malaysian society. As the country rapidly industrialises, it is becoming less rural. Malays in particular are migrating in increasing numbers to the cities. The government's New Economic Policy, in place over the past 20 years, did succeed in transferring a proportion of the national wealth into Malay hands. But Malays themselves see the divisions that have arisen within their own group - between a monied, mainly urban elite and an underprivileged rural class. Umno is nervous that the latter group could desert the party and turn instead to PAS. Over the years, Dr Mahathir has shown himself to be a highly skilled, and at times ruthless, politician. In his mid-sixties, the prime minister sets a fast pace and shows no signs of wishing to retire. At the moment, Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the minister of finance, is viewed as the heir apparant. 'For the next five years,' said Dr Mahathir after the 1990 election, 'I will be free from this kind of nasty politicking. I can concentrate on developing the country, giving people a better life, improving their lot.' His government has certainly improved the Malaysian economy. While growth continues, the opposition and dissident elements within Umno will have little opportunity to mount a clear challenge to Dr Mahathir's leadership. But a change in economic circumstances could mean trouble. Few, least of all Dr Mahathir, forget that the last challenge to the prime minister's leadership was in 1987, a time when the clouds of recession were still blowing across Malaysia.</p>

The official report  about the meeting says the two exchanged views on the talks  process, Russia's initiatives, and the conditions for achieving  a political settlement in the former Yugoslavia. It was  stressed that one of the main conditions is that equal account  be taken of the national and state interests of the sides drawn  into the conflict and that mediation by international  representatives be impartial.    Churkin also met Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. The  sides described the meeting as "a continuation of working  contacts with a high level of mutual understanding." Karadzic  expressed his satisfaction with the fact that when the issue of  a Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia was being discussed, the  Russian side had made it quite clear that the Bosnian Serbs have  the same sovereign rights as the Muslims and Croats. For the  Bosnian Serbs, close relations with Yugoslavia are crucial, so  we have to look for a way towards a settlement that takes  account of this interest, Karadzic said.    Churkin left Belgrade today. He said he was going to  Washington to hold consultations about the Yugoslav problem with  the U.S. President's special representative Charles Redman.</p>

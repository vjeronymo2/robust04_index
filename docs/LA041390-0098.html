			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> COUNCIL URGED TO KEEP MUSEUM OPEN  </P> <P> Members of the Oxnard Cultural and Fine Arts Commission have urged the City  Council to remove the Carnegie Art Museum from a list of proposed budget cuts.  </P> <P> Commission Chairwoman Mona Broyles said Tuesday at a City Council meeting that  closing the museum to help balance the city's budget is "totally unacceptable."  </P> <P> Closing the museum is included in a list of budget reduction options that the  council will consider when it adopts the 1990-91 budget in June. The proposed  cuts come after the council decided last year to cut $1 million from the city's  budget by eliminating about 15 positions because of a decline in revenues.  </P> <P> Estimates of revenue for the 1988-89 fiscal year were about $2 million too  high, and the city had spent $850,000 more than its budget allowed.  </P> <P> The city can save $175,000 a year by closing the museum, said Assistant City  Manager John Tooker.  </P> <P> Council members said Tuesday they will try to keep the museum off the budget  chopping block.  </P> <P> "A city that is growing must have art. No questions about it," Councilwoman  Dorothy Maron said.  </P> <P> The 10,000-square-foot museum, which houses a permanent collection of 250  paintings and sculpture, opened in 1981 and has a staff of one part-time and  three full-time employees, according to museum Director Andrew Voth.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Government of Tanzania is exploring the  possibility of evacuating the remaining Tanzanians from Rwanda  by road to Rusumo. A statement issued today by the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation said a vessel  owned by the Tanzania Railway Corporation, MV Mongozo, is on  standby at Bujumbura port to take the affected evacuees who are  now in Bujumbura. The statement said a group of Tanzanian  nationals who have been evacuated from Kigali arrived in  Bujumbura last Sunday [10 April]. It said those evacuated  include the families of our embassy staff and Tanzanians working  with the Kagera Basin Organization, KBO.    The statement further reiterated Tanzania's readiness to  continue with the role of the facilitator to the Rwanda conflict  and urges all parties concerned to abide by the Arusha peace  agreement which was signed by the parties to the conflict.    Meanwhile, Tanzania's ambassador to Rwanda, Saleh Boi  Tambwe,  has left Dar es Salaam for Bujumbura to supervise the evacuation  of the Tanzanian nationals.</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Hexham picks new candidate HEXHAM Conservatives, fighting back from the resignation of their MP, Mr Alan Amos, following an alleged incident on London's Hampstead Heath, yesterday unveiled their candidate - a 49-year old man with a supportive wife, two children and a labrador, Chris Tighe writes. Mr Peter Atkinson, adopted at a meeting of association members in Hexham yesterday, also has the merit of having been born in the Northumberland constituency. A former journalist in Tyneside and London, since 1984 he has been a public affairs and political consultant, specialising in countryside matters and has advised the British Field Sports Association. He lives in Suffolk, where he is a county councillor, but will move to the constituency.</p>

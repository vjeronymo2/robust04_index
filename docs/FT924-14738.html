			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Watchdog criticises GPG's accounts GPG, Sir Ron Brierley's UK investment company which has had its shares suspended since December 1990, has been criticised by the Financial Reporting Review Panel for breaches of accounting standards. The panel, the UK's watchdog of corporate financial reporting, ruled that GPG's latest set of accounts did not fulfil the requirement to comply with current accounting standards. It said the company's approach 'is not acceptable', but it held back from requiring GPG to re-state its accounts or take other remedial action because the treatment used is shortly to become mandatory. GPG treated a Pounds 5.8m profit mainly generated from the disposal of MCG, a subsidiary, as an exceptional item. The gain was classified as a 'discontinued operation', which would make it an extraordinary item under existing accounting guidelines. The result was to increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 5m to Pounds 10.8m and more than double earnings per share from 1.58p to 3.38p in the accounts for the 12 months to September 30 last year. The panel said the approach breached SSAP 6, the standard dealing with extraordinary items and prior-year adjustments, and SSAP 3, which concerns earnings per share. However, it said the treatment was consistent with Fred 1, the exposure draft on the profit and loss account issued by the Accounting Standards Board, which is to become a standard next month and is likely to convert nearly all extraordinary items into exceptional ones. GPG's treatment is believed to be the reason for a statement issued by the ASB in February stressing that its draft standards were subject to change and should not be adopted until they became mandatory. Mr Blake Nixon, GPG's UK executive director, said: 'I can't really get too fussed about the thing. I'm not particularly sorry. I just see it as a storm in a teacup.' He said the company would have adopted the new treatment even if the effect would have been to reduce profits and earnings. Mr Nixon added that it reflected the approach favoured by Sir Ron Brierley, chairman, that it was an improvement in the way to show profits, and it was in any case due to be adopted shortly.</p>

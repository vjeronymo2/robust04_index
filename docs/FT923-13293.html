			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Cathay Pacific Two clouds have been hanging over the Cathay Pacific share price of late. One is the global recession in air travel, from which even the Asian growth economies have not been wholly insulated. The other has been Hongkong Bank's evident eagerness to sell its remaining 10 per cent stake. Yesterday's news that Chinese interests are to pay HKDollars 3.39bn (Pounds 227m) for the holding removes at least part of the uncertainty and, as the 6 per cent jump in Cathay's price implies, may have a more lasting effect. With more than 22 per cent of the airline now controlled by Chinese interests - including, as from yesterday, a subsidiary of the Civil Aviation Administration of China - Cathay's bargaining position in negotiations over flights in and out of the People's Republic ought now to be improved. The deal, of course, is in line with the Hongkong Bank's avowed intent to shed peripheral assets. Conveniently enough, the stake was in the balance sheet at virtually nothing, so the bank will be able to book a handy exceptional profit to offset provisions for its exposure to Olympia &amp; York - likely to be of the order of USDollars 300m-USDollars 400m - and to Mr John Elliott. The intriguing question is where the clearing-up operation leads to next. One widely touted option is the bank's stake in container terminal group HIT, whose valuation may be boosted by hype over the construction of Hong Kong's Terminal 9.</p>

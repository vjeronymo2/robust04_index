			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Britain and Spain rejoin final sprint for 1993 legislation BRITAIN, which holds the EC presidency, has rejoined the leading group in the final sprint to put single market legislation into place before January 1. Figures published by the European Commission yesterday will spare Britain potential embarrassment at today's Edinburgh summit. They show that the UK is no longer among the Community's legislative laggards. On the other hand, Italy and Belgium are still among the slowest to pass single market legislation through their national parliaments. The triumphant opening of the single market at midnight on December 31 is one of the aims of the British presidency, and EC leaders meeting in Edinburgh are certain to declare that the market is effectively complete, in spite of loopholes caused by delays and political compromises. The leaders will also have to admit that one of the single market's principal objectives - the lifting of border controls on people - will not be fully achieved until the end of 1993, if then. Britain leads opposition to abolishing passport checks. EC directives cannot take effect until they are transferred into national law, and Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC internal market commissioner, has continually stressed the need for effective implementation. After October 30 figures revealed that Britain, Spain, Luxembourg, Belgium and Italy were lagging behind their EC partners, Mr Bangemann wrote to their governments urging them to accelerate the legislative procedure before January 1. Britain and Spain have both taken his complaints to heart. According to figures compiled on December 8, they are now fifth and sixth in the league table, compared with eighth and 12th in the October list. Britain has transferred 81.2 per cent of the relevant measures, just above the Community average. Denmark, which has consistently been the most efficient at transferring legislation into national law, has tranposed 95.9 per cent of the laws.</p>

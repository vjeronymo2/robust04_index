			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of basic agreement for the resumption of the </F> negotiating process between the Government of Guatemala and the  Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity; issued in Mexico City  on 10 January]    [Text] The Guatemalan Government and the Guatemalan  National Revolutionary Unity [URNG] delegations, having met in  Mexico City from 6 to 9 January 1994 under the auspices of the  UN secretary general and as guests of the Government of Mexico,  have reached the following agreement on the framework for the  resumption of the negotiating process to reach a lasting and  firm peace agreement:  <H5>  I. Negotiation Agenda </H5>   The parties will negotiate the general agenda on the set of  issues for the Mexico agreement. For each point, the parties  will jointly decide on the scope of their commitments, which  will be subject to verification.    The government and the URNG have pledged to be duly  represented during the negotiations by high-level delegates in  order to reach political accords that are within the  constitutional framework, without limiting their ability to  reach accords on institutional and constitutional reforms.  <H5>  II. Moderating Bilateral Negotiations </H5>   The parties agreed to request that the UN secretary general  appoint a representative to assume the duties of moderator in  the bilateral negotiations between the government and the URNG.  The parties agreed that the moderator may propose all  initiatives aimed at expediting the signing of a lasting and  firm peace agreement.  <H5>  III. Civil Society </H5>   Both parties recognize the contribution of sectors that, as  a  result of the Oslo Agreement, attended the meetings in El  Escorial, Ottawa, Quito, Metepec, and Atlixco with the URNG.  Such meetings gave momentum to the negotiating process in  Guatemala. Their participation and contribution helped make the  beginning of direct negotiations between the government and the  URNG command possible.    The parties agree that Guatemalan society will continue to  play an essential role in the achievement of peace and in the  process of reconciliation.    Without affecting other mechanisms and forums, be they  temporary or permanent, aimed at favoring national  reconciliation, the parties agreed to promote the creation of an  assembly. Such assembly will be open to participation by all  nongovernmental sectors of Guatemalan society, provided that  they can prove their legitimacy, representation, and legality.  This assembly will operate during the negotiating period and  shall have the following functions:    i) To discuss the substantive agenda of the bilateral  negotiations, that is points ii to vii of the general agenda of  the Mexico Agreement, in order to establish positions of  consensus.    ii) Convey to the UN moderator, the Government of  Guatemala, and the URNG the recommendations and suggestions made  as a result of their deliberations. Such recommendations and  suggestions will not be binding and will be aimed at  facilitating an understanding between the parties. The assembly  will discuss the substantive agenda in accordance with a  calendar adjusted to the established terms of bilateral  negotiations, and it will not be able to delay the process of  bilateral negotiation.    iii) To know the bilateral accords on the substantive  agenda concluded by the parties and endorse said accords to give  them the character of national commitment, which will facilitate  their implementation. However, if for some reason this  bilateral accord is not endorsed, this accord will maintain its  validity.    The parties agreed to ask that the Bishops Conference of  Guatemala consider Monsignor Rodolfo Quezada Toruno for the post  of conciliator, when appointing the president of the assembly.  The president of the assembly will have the support of an  organizing committee. The organizing committee will consist of  representatives from each of the sectors that participated in  the Oslo process and representatives from Mayan sectors.    The president of the assembly will have the following  duties:    i) To convene the assembly.    ii) To organize its deliberations with the assistance of  the organizing committee.    iii) To promote the drafting of recommendations for a  consensus on the points of the agenda.    iv) To inform the UN moderator and the parties of the  recommendations and guidance suggested as a result of the  assembly deliberations and to participate in special sessions of  the bilateral talks convoked for this purpose by agreement by  the parties concerned.    v) To receive from the UN moderator the bilateral  agreements on substantive topics signed by the two parties. To  inform the assembly about them and promote their approval by the  assembly.  <H5>  IV. Role of Friendly Countries </H5>   The parties ask the Governments of Colombia, Spain, the  United States, Mexico, Norway, and Venezuela to constitute a  group of friends to the Guatemalan peace process. The friendly  countries, duly informed of the progress and content of the  negotiations between the parties, will have the following duties:    i) To support, with their efforts, the UN secretary  general representative in speeding up the negotiation process.    ii) To give greater security and firmness to the  commitments made by the parties in their role as honor witnesses  of the agreements reached within the negotiating process, when  the parties so request it.  <H5>  V. Procedures </H5>   i) Dissemination: The parties agreed that the bilateral  negotiations will be carried out under the utmost secrecy to  guarantee that they will be held in a climate of trust and  seriousness. They agreed that the only public information on  the status of the talks will be given by the representatives of  the UN secretary general in order to coordinate them with the  work of the assembly. The moderator and the president of the  assembly will establish adequate agreements to permit an  exchange of information that will not violate the secrecy needed  for the negotiations.    ii) Temporary framework: The parties expressed their  commitment to reach an agreement for a firm and lasting peace  within the shortest time possible in 1994. Within this context,  they agreed to give proof of the necessary flexibility for the  successful negotiation of the general agenda.    iii) Within the framework of their efforts to speed up the  negotiating process, the parties recognized the advisability of  resorting to any measure that will bring about rapprochement and  agreements between them and stated that they are wiling to  respond to any requests made by the moderator in this regard.  <H5>  VI. Verification Mechanisms </H5>   Verification is a key factor in guaranteeing compliance with  and respect for the agreements. Consequently, the parties  reiterated that all agreements must be accompanied by the  appropriate national and international mechanisms for  verification. The United Nations gives a high degree of  reliability to international verification. Both parties agreed  to ask the United Nations for verification of all the agreements  in substantive as well as operational aspects.

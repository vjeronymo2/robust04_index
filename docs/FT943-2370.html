			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Report finds EU trade policy wanting - 'Union has exhausted capacity to expand regional trade in a significant way for a long time' The trade policies of the European Union demonstrate blindness, according to Patrick Messerlin, professor of economics at the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris, in a report published today by the Centre for Policy Studies, a London-based think-tank*. 'Until recently,' argues Prof Messerlin, 'the US had no serious alternative to a policy based on the Gatt disciplines. The strong protectionist mood south of the River Grande. . . prevented any regional alternative. . . In sharp contrast the EU member states could always count on freer trade among themselves to provide additional growth opportunities. 'The situation will be reversed in years to come. The US. . . will enjoy the relaxation that regional opportunities can offer. By contrast, the EU has exhausted its capacity to expand regional trade in a significant way for a long time to come. The EU - bordered on its southern and eastern flanks by countries unconvinced of the gains from freer trade, or too small to bring substantial benefits to the EU - will be in the same position as the US in the 1950s and 1960s.' An indication of the EU's failure to recognise this necessity is its addiction to contingent protection, notably anti-dumping. Prof Messerlin notes that dumping is found in 95 per cent of the cases investigated by the Commission - 'a conviction rate rarely matched in other judicial procedures'. He also points out that almost 80 per cent of cases have been terminated by measures and that these have erected high barriers, the average EU duty being 20 per cent. Recent cases have been no better: of the 21 cases for which decisions have been published in 1994, measures were taken in 19 and almost all imposed anti-dumping duties ranging from 35-97 per cent. The Uruguay Round outcome, though deserving of 'two cheers' according to Mr Brian Hindley of the London School of Economics, 'comes very close to authorising the biased procedures' used to calculate dumping margins. 'If dumping and injury can be shown whenever it suits a government to do so,' states Mr Hindley, 'that government can also increase protection for a domestic industry whenever it suits it to do so.' In addition, anti-dumping actions can be discharged by 'undertakings', which are similar to the voluntary export restraints supposedly eliminated in the Round. So 'what becomes of the Gatt pledge to 'eliminate discriminatory treatment in international commerce'?' Prof Messerlin, too, gives a mixed evaluation of the effects of the Round on anti-dumping actions by the EU. He notes that, hitherto, approval of definitive measures in anti-dumping and subsidy cases has required a qualified majority. 'Under the new rules, however, decisions of the Council . . . are taken by a simple majority. Hence the votes of six member states are now needed to overturn a definitive measure suggested by the Commission.' *Trade Policy Review 1994, edited by Brian Hindley and Deepak Lal, Centre for Policy Studies, 52 Rochester Row, London SW1P 1JU.

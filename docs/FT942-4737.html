			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Measurement setback for Staveley Staveley Industries, the measurement and mechanical engineering company which also owns British Salt, suffered a 65 per cent fall in pre-tax profits in the year to April 2 after a poor performance and a Pounds 10m reorganisation charge in its measurement division. However, the total dividend will be held at 8.5p via an unchanged final of 6.2p. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 24.4m to Pounds 8.6m on turnover down 2 per cent at Pounds 338.9m (Pounds 344.9m). Operating profits dipped 19 per cent to Pounds 20.2m. 'We have had a difficult year, but we believe the major problems have been tackled. I feel we have good prospects for growth - the key is to bring in the benefits of the reorganisation,' said Mr Roy Hitchens, chief executive. The company's minerals division, which supplies more than half of the UK salt market, lifted operating profits from Pounds 12.2m to Pounds 13m. However, the measurement division performed poorly with operating profits down to Pounds 5.1m (Pounds 8.4m). The reorganisation includes rationalising Chronos Richardson, the systems division, by creating a single global operation. Its plants in Germany and the US will be closed and manufacture transferred to Nottingham where the company will use a network of subcontractors. Mr Hitchens said this was to exploit UK labour rates which were 50 per cent lower than Germany's. The mechanical and electrical services side suffered a 9 per cent drop in profits to Pounds 4m. Earnings per share fell 79 per cent to 3.4p, but excluding re-organisation and exceptional costs they dropped 14 per cent to 13.9p (16.1p). COMMENT Staveley's latest reorganisation plan faces a credibility problem. Several earlier attempts to overhaul the measurement division have failed over the past six years. But the new management team deserves the benefit of the doubt. If the division's shake up works, growth could be enhanced by acquisitions in niche markets. The minerals division remains safe and cash-generative. The mechanical and electrical services division should perform better next year as the upturn in construction takes hold. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 25m look possible this year for earnings of 16.4p. On a closing price yesterday of 209p, down  1/2 p, the shares are on prospective p/e of 12.7. That is good value if the management makes good on their promises.</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Technology: Foxing the car thieves While the beleaguered car industry does its best to persuade reluctant consumers to buy new vehicles, a growing number of people has decided there is a much better way to acquire them - by theft. In the five years to the end of 1991, vehicle theft in the UK rose by an alarming 50 per cent. More than 626,000 vehicles were reported stolen in 1991, a rise of nearly a fifth over 1990; 225,000 were not recovered. Disturbingly, the UK leads the EC in vehicle theft, with owners having a one in 32 chance of their vehicles being stolen. In the US, it is one in 117. Manufacturers build in electronic and other safety systems and drivers can put heavy locks on to their steering wheels whenever they leave their cars. But a new anti-theft detection system, called Tracker, will shortly be available in the UK, following its introduction in the US (under the name of LoJack System) a few years ago. Tracker is based on a small transponder, which will be sold to vehicle owners and hidden in cars or trucks by trained installers. When a theft is reported, a telecommunications system linked to the central computer of Tracker Network - the newly formed company operating Tracker in the UK - will send a digitally coded radio signal to the device in the stolen vehicle. Police officers in cars fitted with a special direction finder will be able to detect the tracking signal and find the stolen vehicle. The transponder can be installed in up to 30 possible locations in a vehicle. Motorists will be able to buy Tracker units for Pounds 160 (Pounds 220 for heavy trucks), with an annual fee of Pounds 61.10. The company says most police forces in Britain have agreed to use the tracking equipment, with others likely to operate it soon. Several big insurance companies have said they will offer discounts (as in the US) of between 7 and 15 per cent on premiums to vehicle owners subscribing to Tracker.</p>

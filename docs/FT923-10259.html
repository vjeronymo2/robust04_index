			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia 'exporting less aluminium' ALUMINIUM EXPORTS from Russia have slowed to a trickle, according to some traders. They suggest that Russian assertions that exports are being sustained at about 75 per cent of last year's level do not stand up to close examination. Problems with raw materials and spare parts continue to dog Russia's smelters, which are said to be particularly short of alumina, the essential raw material, the traders report. An official at one big trading house, who asked not to be identified, said yesterday that only about 10 per cent of the alumina his company had sold to Russia recently was finding its way to the smelters. Not only was there a shortage of money to pay or goods to barter but transport within Russia was in a chaotic state and there were no rail cars available to carry alumina. To make matters worse, Hungalu, the state-owned Hungarian producer, has not been able to agree terms of a barter deal with the Commonwealth of Independent States and will ship no alumina there in the second half of this year. The company was scheduled to export 250,000 to 300,000 tonnes to the CIS in the second six months of 1992 - enough to produce 125,000 to 150,000 tonnes of aluminium. Consequently Hungalu is closing its 180,000-tonnes-a-year Ajka 1 alumina plant and 800 people will be laid off. The Metals Week newsletter says, however, that Hungalu officials hint that Hungarian alumina exports to the CIS will continue through western intermediaries because the Russian aluminium industry is heavily dependent on them, particularly after losing its supply from Yugoslavia. The Hungarian officials suggest that some CIS smelters are so short of raw material that alumina is being rushed from rail cars to smelters as soon as it arrives. Hungary has been shipping 1,500 to 1,800 tonnes a day. Some estimates suggest that Russian aluminium exports reached a record 1m tonnes last year although other analysts put the total nearer 850,000 tonnes. Russia's official target for 1992 exports is 615,000 tonnes. But some western traders suggest that the country's difficulties are so great that it will be doing well to export 400,000 tonnes this year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Lagos, 26 Apr (AFP) -- A former Nigerian head of  state gave Cameroon a disputed border area as a reward for its  "neutrality" in Nigeria's civil war, but subsequent governments  repudiated the agreement, according to Nigeria's foreign  minister. Alhaji Baba Gana Kingibe told this week's edition of  THE NEWS magazine that a deal was done between General Gowon and  Cameroon leader Ahmadou Ahidjo.    This was the first time a senior Nigerian official  acknowledged the deal since the dispute over Bakassi Peninsula,  a 1,000 square kilometre territory in the Gulf of Guinea, flared  again at the beginning of this year. Gowon has until now denied  signing an accord ceding the territory.    The treaty, however, was not ratified by the Supreme  Military  Council, the highest decision-making organ during the Gowon  regime, before he was toppled in July 1975 in a coup, the  minister said. The military governments of Generals Murtala  Mohamed and Olusegun Obasanjo that succeeded his regime  immediately repudiated the agreement, he added. Consequently,  "that is a dead treaty" and "all the superficial arguments which  Cameroon has been dangling (over the issue) do not help," he  added. [passage omitted]</p>

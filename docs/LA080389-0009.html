Well written, well argued,  however, when boiled down it tells us this: "We must go ahead and kill  ourselves with industrial pollution because it would be too expensive and too  inconvenient to stay alive."  </P> <P> Their economists' approach pushed my doggerel button and this came out:  </P> <P> "When they speak of pollution and such, the Feldsteins are quite out of touch;  </P> <P> "Don't bother to strive, too keep us alive, for living will cost us too much."  </P> <P> WALT HOPMANS  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 22 May (MENA)--Minister of Petroleum Dr.  Hamdi al-Banbi has announced a new ministry strategy to extend  help to foreign companies prospecting for oil and natural gas.  The strategy allows these companies to market their share of  discovered crude if they desire.    In a statement made today, he said the Egyptian General  Petroleum Authority will buy the foreign partner's share of the  discovered natural gas under a gas-selling accord. A 75-percent  share of gas will be purchased to provide natural gas for  production and services as part of a plan to replace oil  products with natural gas and secure oil for export to acquire  foreign currency necessary to implement the five-year  economic-social plan and avoid borrowing.    He noted that the Egyptian General Petroleum Authority is  constantly working to attract as many international oil and  natural gas prospecting companies as possible by inviting  international bids for basins with new high oil and natural gas  potential to allow these companies to make appropriate decisions  on investing in Egypt.    He remarked that this policy has succeeded in attracting  numerous new companies to Egypt over the past years and that  major international companies that left Egypt 10 years ago have  decided to return after discovering that Egyptian oil agreements  have improved and developed.    Dr. al-Banbi said that the oil sector recently opened the  door to the Egyptian private sector to participate in oil and  natural gas exploration and prospecting because that sector has  gained experience in the field. The aim of this plan, he added,  is to close the gap that might be caused when some international  companies withdraw from the Egyptian market for any reason.</p>

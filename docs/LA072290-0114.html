			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'BREWSTER'S MILLIONS' MEETS 'DALLAS';  </P> <P> TYCOON BY TERRY PRINGLE (ALGONQUIN BOOKS: $18.95; 281 PP; 0-945575-30-0  </P> <P> It is sometimes said of the son of a rich man, "He was born on third base and  thinks he hit a triple."  </P> <P> "Tycoon," Terry Pringle's third novel, is narrated by William C. Brewster III,  a rich boy who is content to stay on third all his life, commenting on the  foibles and difficulties of those at bat.  </P> <P> The setting for Pringle's novel is Abilene, Tex., a small city in west Texas  dominated by money, oil and religion. The Brewster family is well established  in Abilene, high up in the social ranking, having made its money early in oil,  and having managed to hang on to that fortune. It took grit and daring for  Boomer, Billy's grandfather, to prevail as an early wildcatter. It took savvy  and determination for Billy's father to build an oil-exploration business that  survives the cycle of good and bad times characteristic of the oil business.  </P> <P> "The stories the two men told were as different as they were. Boomer would tell  me about the time he'd rented a pool table to sleep on in Beaumont, with every  room, cot and barber chair already taken . . . only to awaken the next morning  to learn his boots had been stolen right off his feet. My old man would counter  with a story about the time he'd plugged a well with drilling mud all by  himself, carrying it in five-gallon buckets by hand from the mud pit, a process  which had taken a week."  </P> <P> But for Billy to excel -- that would take desire, and the only thing Billy  Brewster exhibits much desire for in the whole novel is another chance to go to  bed with his childhood sweetheart, Sally Ann. Early on, he explains, "Half the  time we were good friends, half the time lovers, and she could behave so  unpredictably she normally was driving me crazy. Her reasoning always was, 'I'm  trying to keep things interesting.' " She refuses to marry him because it would  ruin their good thing.  </P> <P> Sally Ann is beautiful, rich, and wild (for Abilene), a male fantasy come true  -- she is always seductive, always elusive, and nearly always willing.  </P> <P> Enter Stanley Gaines, the son of a poor widow with a bad reputation. He is  gawky, badly dressed and from the wrong side of town. As a boy, he was the butt  of jokes, and Billy witnessed Stan urinating on his tormentors. As a man, Stan  Gaines has a shameless aggression that will get him what he wants. And what he  wants is essentially to be what Billy Brewster is -- socially accepted, rich  and secure. With Billy's help, he gets a job with Brewster Drilling, persuades  a stubborn landowner to permit drilling on her property, and his career is off  the ground. With no background, knowledge or training, Stanley Gaines is an oil  tycoon in the making.  </P> <P> It is through Gaines' career in oil and real estate that Pringle narrates the  economic history of Texas from 1965 to the 1980s. With no capital and nothing  but "his best Dale Carnegie manner," Stan Gaines succeeds. He impresses Billy's  father, who has been looking for a spark from his own son and never finds it.  </P> <P> Stan becomes a partner in Brewster Drilling and founds Gaines Petroleum. He  expands into real estate. He moves to Dallas, where all good media-Tex tycoons  go to show off. (In the TV series "Dallas," Texas is not portrayed, but rather  the mythical land of Media-Tex.) And, eventually, Gaines goes bankrupt, the  latest plot twist in tales of the Texas rich.  </P> <P> Although the economic drama takes up much of the energy of the novel, the only  Gaines victory that stirs the narrator is Stan's wooing and winning of Sally  Ann. The play of the poor man against the rich man is complete.  </P> <P> Gaines seems to be taking Billy Brewster's place everywhere -- in his father's  affection, in business, in love. Lucky Billy, born with everything, ends up  with some money, a son he loves in a grudging way and a wife he despises. He  narrates what should be a story of a triangle of frustration and failure --  each man keeping what the other really wants.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, Pringle's gifts as a writer do not live up to his ambition. The  loping, good-humored tone of the narrative is without variety, so that when  Brewster comes back from Vietnam, finally angry about something, he sounds like  an article from Time magazine. He professes to love his son, but the love never  is convincing in action. He professes to be obsessed with finding out the  secret of Stan Gaines' past, but the secrets turn out to be not so much and not  so interesting.  </P> <P> Mostly, the reader doesn't know how to react. The heroic Boomer's death is  recounted in this way: "My grandfather had passed on during 'General Hospital,'  and the last words he'd spoken had been: I told you to stay away from that  woman. My mother had found him sitting in his ragged rocker-recliner, head  forward, chin on his chest. . . . Boomer had watched the cattle come up the  Western Trail, had been part of the free-wheeling, nitro-shooting, leg-to-leg  derrick days. Control over the price of oil had passed out of the hands of the  Texas Railroad Commission -- and out of the country altogether. With the death  of Boomer and the Arab oil embargo, I somehow felt cut off, drifting. . . ."  </P> <P> I suppose it would be possible, in the hands of a master writer, to feel a lump  in the throat at the thought of the losses suffered by the Texas Railroad  Commission. But Pringle's characters are too wooden, flat and unchanging for  the reader to feel much for them. Nostalgia for the Golden West has gone a long  way in American entertainment and letters, but it doesn't really work here. The  nostalgia strikes a particularly sour note in Billy and Sally Ann's pining for  the comancheria, of which Abilene was a part before whites killed or ran off  the Indians. Pity the poor capitalist, the novel seems to be demanding. Only if  the writing were extraordinary would one be tempted.  </P> <P> As it is, the story goes on too long. Adultery between Sally Ann and Billy goes  on until even Billy understands that Sally Ann's husband knows and doesn't  care. The older generation passes through -- Billy's mother simply disappears  from the book after she performs her Good Woman task of urging her son into a  bad marriage. Stan's mother, Melissa, whom Pringle attempts to make an echo of  Sally Ann's wanton sexuality with the added twist of Evangelical Christianity,  never really becomes convincing, either as a seductress or as a religious  tyrant to her son.  </P> <P> Inevitably, when reading a novel about West Texans one thinks of Larry  McMurtry. McMurtry's characters often are broadly drawn, but his energetic  prose and infallible sense of story make his characters both touching and  larger than life. McMurtry's people have the ring of truth, even his women, of  whom Pringle's Sally Ann is a faint, literary cousin. McMurtry's portraits,  even of scoundrels, are filled with affection and intelligence.  </P> <P> Without a strong narrative gift, a novel such as Pringle's comes to sound  didactic. It is full of information about the oil business but it lacks  compelling characters. Unless the reader really cares about the oil business,  the characters seem like an excuse for a novel, rather than its cause.  </P> <P> Pringle's ambitious novel of West Texans and their loves and money fails  because the prose is too ordinary, the characters too thin and the story not  intriguing enough. For all the vast amounts of money mentioned, and all the  barrels of oil, for the whole laborious process of getting rich and becoming  poor detailed here, one can only say that Pringle's West Texas is too small.  </P></p>

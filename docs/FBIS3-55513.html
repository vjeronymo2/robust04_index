Speaking on Russian television on Sunday, Lavrov said that  the programme will be submitted to the government as soon as the  sources of its financing are found.    He voiced concern about the position of many Russians in  some  republics of the former Soviet Union, especially in Latvia and  Estonia where about 1.5 million Russians are deprived of their  civil and political rights.    He said similar problems face Russians in Central Asian  republics, including Kazakhstan. Although Russia has friendly  relations with that republic, the Kazakh Constitution says that  the Kazakh nation, rather that Kazakhstan's people, will seek to  restore its statehood. This lends an ethnic flavour to the  entire concept of statehood of Kazakhstan where Russians and  Kazakhs account for about 40 per cent of the total each, the  deputy minister noted.    Lavrov said that the idea of dual citizenship is  encountering  tremendous difficulties in former Soviet republics. He  admitted, however, that although dual citizenship will not solve  all the problems, it may have a positive psychological impact on  people and help ease tension.</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Avesco plans to demerge its Videologic offshoot AVESCO, the broadcast equipment and media services group, said yesterday that it plans to spin-off its fast-growing Videologic multimedia and computer graphics subsidiary. The group also announced a 1-for-3 rights issue at 63p per share to raise a net Pounds 12.1m. The shares, which have risen sharply in recent months amid speculation about Videologic, yesterday jumped another 13p to close at 98p. Meanwhile, Avesco forecast that in the year which ends today it would report a pre-tax loss of not more than Pounds 1.5m, including an unrealised currency exchange loss of about Pounds 500,000, compared to a Pounds 2.3m pre-tax loss a year ago. Avesco does not plan to pay a dividend this year. The proceeds of the rights issue, underwritten by SG Warburg, will mainly be used to reduce debt and provide additional working capital for Videologic over the next nine months as it brings a string of new products to market. In June Videologic formed an alliance with IBM to design and develop high volume multimedia products for personal computers - products combining text, audio, graphics and video. Ten new products are currently under development, including those Videologic is developing for itself. Mr Richard Murray, chairman, said Avesco plans to demerge Videologic once the commercial success of the new products to be launched by the company this year is clearer and 'as soon as is practically possible.' In the interim he said the group plans to strengthen Videologic's senior management including appointing a finance director together with a chief executive for its US operations The demerger, to be accomplished by giving existing Avesco shareholders new shares in Videologic together with a floatation either in the UK or US, is designed to provide Videologic with the flexibility to secure financing for its longer term growth. Since acquiring Videologic four years ago for Pounds 6m Avesco has invested another Pounds 6.6m in the subsidiary, swallowing up most of the funds available for investment within the group. Over the past five years Videologic's turnover has grown at a compound rate of over 40 per cent and overseas sales now account for 75 per cent of its total revenues. Yesterday Avesco forecast that the subsidiary would record turnover of not less than Pounds 10.4m in the year to March 31, an increase of 44 per cent over last year's Pounds 7.2m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Olga Semenova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 14 TASS -- Despite all the reshuffling  and financial difficulties, the Russian intelligence remains  among the four best secret services in the world which also  include the CIA, the Israeli Mossad and the British secret  service. "We have always been in the league and, I hope, will  remain there", first deputy director of the Russian Foreign  Intelligence Service (SVR) Vyacheslav Trubnikov told TASS on  Tuesday.    He did not specify who occupies which place among the four,  but said that hardly any of the secret services would have  succeeded to maintain the leading positions had they been in the  same financial plight as the SVR.    "I am sure that had the personnel of our `competitors' been  in the same conditions as the Russian intelligence is facing,  hardly many of them would have tolerated that. And our men do  serve and will serve", Trubnikov said.    The Foreign Intelligence Service which appeared after the  collapse of the notorious KGB is no longer engaged in political  persecutions. According to Trubnikov, "intelligence ceased to  be a semi-state and semi-(communist) party body which it was in  the times of the KGB". It no longer works for any political  party, advocates no ideology, acts independently and according  to law and is controlled by the legislative and executive  authorities.    The task of the intelligence is to monitor and assess  threats  to Russian national interests. "In general the tendencies in  world development are favourable for our country, however, the  spectrum of threats remains rather wide", Trubnikov said and  added that the major threat at present is the "hot spots" on the  Russian borders.</p>

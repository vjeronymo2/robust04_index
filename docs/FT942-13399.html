			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt Germany's private-sector economists are starting to bring their economic growth forecasts into line with the perky prognoses aired last week by economics minister Mr Gunter Rexrodt. Even allowing for the electioneering content of his statements, many tend to agree that 1.5 per cent pan-German growth is likely this year. The net short-term result is likely to be a diversion of investors' attention from interest rate possibilities to cyclical stocks, despite the DAX's gyrations early last week, according to DB Research. Rate prospects will be reviewed early this week, when the Bundesbank is due finally to come up with its March M3 figures. Markets will be examining the broken-down money supply numbers rather than the headline rate - likely still to be distorted by the Buba's notorious 'special factors' - for any signs of lurking inflationary pressure. The main regional inflation figures are also due in. Last Friday, Baden-Wurttemberg reported a 0.3 per cent month-on-month rise and a 3.1 per cent annual rate. At the same time, west German March producer prices were reported up 0.3 per cent year-on-year. This could suggest industry shares some of Mr Rexrodt's optimism and will try to claw back some of the margin cuts it has borne over the past 18 months.</p>

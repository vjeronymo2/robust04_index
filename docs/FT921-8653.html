			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (13): Optimistic forecasts - Pen-based Systems ACCORDING to the famous saying by Baron Lytton (1803-1873), 'the pen is mightier than the sword.' The pen may also prove a more powerful tool than the computer keyboard if pen-based computer systems turn out to be as popular as many manufacturers and industry analysts now predict. Pen computers come in several guises, although most are electronic tablets which resemble a Victorian school slate, complete with a stylus or 'pen'. The pen is used to write free text, fill in boxes or indicate sections of diagram on the computer screen. Such systems generate excitement because they enable the most keyboard-illiterate, from the chief executive to the humblest blue-collar worker, to exploit computer technology. Pen computers are being developed in both the US and Europe. One of the latest, from Momenta International of California, is a hybrid system, incorporating a keyboard as well as a pen. This, says Mr Mike Daly, former managing director of Grid Computers in the UK, makes it ideal for applications such as business planning or for editing and correcting reports. Other types of pen PCs fall into three categories. Machines in the first category are intended for vertical applications, where customised software enables engineers, nurses or surveyors, for example, to gather data. One application using the Gridpad machine, from Victor Technologies, part of the Tandy group, is for crash assessors from motor insurance companies. It uses the Gridpad to calculate the cost of repairs by displaying expanded vehicle diagrams on the screen. By touching individual components on the screen with the pen, the machine automatically records the parts that need replacing. This data can then be sent over a telephone line directly to a mainframe computer where the price of the replacement part and labour costs can be calculated. A similar package, to enable surveyors or architects to collect data on the site of a refurbishment project, is under development for the NCR pen system, by SurvSoft, of Weston-Super-Mare. By indicating the appropriate component from the diagramatic selection of walls, floors and ceilings that are stored on the hand-held machine, the surveyor can build up a picture of the surroundings. The appropriate measurements are inserted by calling up a calculator pad on the screen and then indicating the appropriate figures. The plan can then be fed back into the computer system in the office. More sophisticated than these are machines which can actually recognise handwriting. Although most of today's systems can recognise letters or numbers, and can store signatures, the ability to use a pen PC like the traditional notebook and pen is still some way off. Mr Chris Fell, an analyst at information technology research group Dataquest, predicts it will be 1994 before such systems become reliable enough to find widespread acceptance. The third category comprise the simplest systems, which are intended for applications where a paper copy is required but where a printer would be cumbersome or too expensive. One example of such a machine is the ScriptWriter produced by Peripheral Vision of the UK. It can be used for taking down an order, and leaving a hard copy with the person placing the order. Or it can be used by traffic wardens: as the warden writes down the details of the ticket on the sheet of paper placed on top of the board, the pressure registers the same information - car registration plate, for example - into the computer memory. Once the warden returns to base, the details can be fed into the main computer system. Because the application requires little more than a simple form to enable the warden or salesperson to take down simple details, these electronic clipboards are considerably less expensive than their more sophisticated counterparts, and therefore are finding more widespread applications with blue-collar workers. Mr Bill Clough, president of Microslate, the Montreal-based pen computer maker, points out that in North America the white-collar market is 95 per cent saturated with computer technology while the blue-collar workforce is only 11 per cent saturated. In Europe the situation is different. Mr Alasdair Macgregor, UK marketing manager for workstation systems at NCR, says that companies such as his are aiming at the white-collar worker because that is where most corporations will get the best return on investment. One factor which could inhibit the growth of the market is any dispute over the operating system used in pen-based systems. SurvSoft, for example, uses 'windows' software, so that pictures, or 'icons' appear on the screen. This approach is being promoted by Microsoft with the Pen Windows version of its popular Windows software environment. This will enable users to adapt Windows applications developed for desktop computers for use on pen computers. But many believe its lifespan will be limited. More promising in the longer-term, believes Mr Fell, is the Penpoint operating system developed by Go, the California start-up company. It has been specifically designed for pen PCs, and is therefore a more appropriate solution. Mr Fell believes a dispute between promoters of the two approaches could well be avoided, with the market moving progressively from the Windows approach to the Go one. If this proves correct, then pen technology could prove the next revolution in computing.</p>

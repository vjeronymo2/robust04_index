			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Survival will suffice: John Major can claim success at Edinburgh if he can somehow achieve a non-disaster There is little practical value in high and mighty deliberations about Britain's aims for the European Community summit in Edinburgh next week. This is not an occasion for lofty thoughts. We need not consider the destiny of a continent whose rhetoric about ever-closer unity is tempered by a resurgence of nationalism. Another time will do for all that. The prime minister holds the presidency of the European Council for a few more weeks. The government's hopes are high, but its confidence is low, or at least it wants people to think that it is. It dreams of glory, but what it really seeks is survival. Survival? If the summit is not a flop, if it is merely another ho-hum meeting in a long series of such confabulations, that will be all right. The remaining shreds of Mr John Major's credibility could survive such an experience. If it ends in pandemonium, let the proximate cause be a fault committed by a continental country or group of countries. Britain must not be the guilty party. A continued show of willingness to be European can at least enable the government to say that it has kept itself 'at the heart of Europe'. In short, survival may be all that is required. No one can tell whether the EC is merely in the throes of one of its characteristic crises or whether it is beginning to fall apart. That is for history to determine. What the prime minister can ensure is that the British are involved in multilateral discussions whenever they take place. We must always be participants, and when possible equal partners. That is the principal aim of Mr Major's European policy. It need not be jeopardised at Edinburgh. Even with such a limited horizon, it is tempting to regard the prospect for next week with a dismal eye. Everything is in place for what might turn out to be a bad-tempered ending to a British presidency whose tendency to fall on its nether end must have the clowns of this world suffering fits of jealousy. Yet it would be a mistake to take negative speculation too far. Governments always talk down summits in the weeks before they are held. Mr Major, who has not enjoyed a happy autumn, is, as ever, fighting for his political life. He greatly needs some demonstration of success, or at least non-failure. Almost anything will do. An agreement on the Danish question, the budget and subsidiarity would constitute a success, even if enlargement of the Community, an anti-recession programme and France's doubts about the Gatt agreement were set aside for another day. Yesterday's ingenious proposals for Denmark are promising. Flim-flam on subsidiarity should be possible. An intimation of 'progress' on the budget is achievable. If none of that is available a flat communique that solves few problems might be the least-worst outcome. On most issues, broad statements of good intent, accompanied by timetabled schemes for working out the details, might be just enough. The key is to make the hand-over to the Danish presidency look respectable. Such an outcome need not be a disaster. With a little bit of luck, the prime minister can achieve a non-disaster. Quite possibly, he can do better. He has spent the best part of a fortnight travelling around the EC, his hand out-thrust, his straight-in-your face friendly smile to the fore, looking for deals. This is what Mr Major is good at. He is a tactile politician, not unlike many American counterparts. When he is really fed up with you he puts a hand on your shoulder and looks you in the eye. He would have made a brilliant commercial traveller. Perhaps he has studied the literature. He behaves like an archetypal student of Getting to Yes. The chapter headings of that classic 1980s volume by Roger Fisher and William Ury suggest Major-like responses. I recommend 'What If They Won't Play?' and 'What If They Use Dirty Tricks?' as well as 'What If They Are More Powerful?' (answer: 'develop your BATNA - Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement'). It is this self-disciplined and personable John Major who bartered for the best available deal at Maastricht a year ago. It is this same prime minister whose telephone diplomacy helped get the Gatt talks re-started following their dramatic breakdown last month. This is the man who cajoled the Queen into realising that she had better volunteer to pay taxes. He is good at business relationships, and a dedicated ferret in search of the other side's bargaining strengths and weaknesses. These carefully nurtured skills have been of little use against the storms of 1992. No amount of charm could disguise the fact that by voting No in the summer the Danes may have scuppered the Maastricht treaty. A warm handshake could not cure the almost fatal shock of Black Wednesday. Pleas and salesmanship may have helped the prime minister win over a few recalcitrant backbenchers at the end of the recent paving debate on the bill to ratify the treaty, but it was not enough. In the end Mr Major had to fall back on his BATNA: he conceded that Britain's parliament would not take a final vote on Maastricht until after the second Danish referendum. The debate on the bill in the commons this week was purely symbolic. All of this has soured the atmosphere at EC meetings. French, Dutch and German criticisms of Britain's presidency have not been mere negotiating ploys; some appear to be heartfelt. There is still a likelihood that at their private pre-summit meeting President Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl (neither of whom have enjoyed recent sales calls from Mr Major) will devise a joint approach to Edinburgh that spoils Mr Major's party. The prime minister's pressing of the German flesh has paid dividends in the past; its effect will be put to the test again next week. He may be fortunate. It is in the German interest to prevent a British humiliation. What is missing from all of this is a sense of positive purpose. The government is no different from most of its predecessors in wanting to see what its continental partners are doing in order to put a stop to it. Opinion at the centre of the Conservative party is little different from its counterpart of 30 years ago, when many Tories could not understand why we needed anything more than a European free trade area. Mr Major developed a second line of argument after Maastricht: that the treaty represented the start of a turn away from central control and towards a Europe of nations. This is a reflection of reality. Whatever the aspirations of Euro-federalists, in practice the fundamental interests of member states are rarely over-ridden. The Commission's powers have been increased because of the single market. The government needs to develop proposals based on this foundation. Perhaps in the balmy days after the presidency is laid down it will learn to argue convincingly for such a Europe, such an Efta-plus. That is, as Mr Kohl has perceived, the most the British will accept. For all their fine words, it is clearly the most the French will put up with, the exception being proposals for stronger ties to Germany. Efta-plus is Germany's outer circle, beyond its D-Mark zone. It is there that the Tories are most likely to seek a Europe they can live with.</p>

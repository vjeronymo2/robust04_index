			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Moment of truth for Zimbabwe reforms: Tony Hawkins previews a budget of all-round cuts when the economy is at its weakest ZIMBABWE'S moment of fiscal truth arrives today when Mr Bernard Chidzero, the finance minister, delivers his budget to parliament. After 18 months of painfully slow implementation of structural economic reforms, the man who has presided over the country's descent into low-income from middle-income status, is committed by agreement with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to announce spending cuts, subsidy reductions and tax increases. The timing could hardly be worse. The country is experiencing its steepest fall in output since the depression of 1931. Official forecasts are for gross domestic product to fall 9 per cent this year, largely because of a 35 per cent decline in agricultural production after the worst drought in living memory. The macro-economic aggregates are almost uniformly horrendous: the country has a balance of payments deficit of more than Dollars 1bn, or 20 per cent of GDP; inflation, now 39 per cent, is likely to exceed 40 per cent for a month or two before peaking; and 75,000 retrenchments are planned over the next year - 6 per cent of the employed workforce - when unemployment is already 1m, or 20 per cent of the labour force. The business community, which at first enthusiastically embraced the structural adjustment programme sponsored by the IMF and World Bank, is hurting. It is critical of heel-dragging by the government especially in the field of para-statal and public sector reform. The government's claim that it is eliminating para-statal subsidies is accurate but the method - allowing state enterprises to indulge in an orgy of cost-plus pricing - is, along with a 46 per cent devaluation last year, largely responsible for escalating production costs. Industrialists complain bitterly that no efforts are being made to improve efficiency and productivity in state-owned monopolies. Industry is caught in a classic cost-price squeeze; demand at home - and increasingly in the region - is collapsing because of the drought and a weak South African economy - the country's main market for non-traditional exports. Companies are reporting costs increases of more than 40 per cent over the past year. The government's enhanced structural adjustment facility loan from the IMF stipulates that Zimbabwe's central bank maintain positive real money market interest rates (the 90-day rate for negotiable certificates of deposit). With inflation about to move above 40 per cent, interest rates are set to rise further. Some banks are warning the government of overkill, but with all escape routes closed, other than to the IMF and World Bank, an unparalleled spell of monetary and fiscal discipline is looming. Past promises to cut spending during Mr Chidzero's 10-year tenure at the finance ministry have come to nought, but this time, the terms of the IMF deal will force him to do what he should have done years ago. Mr Chidzero is committed to cut government spending to 42 per cent of GDP from 48 per cent last year. This implies cutting spending by some ZDollars 2bn (Pounds 210m). This is to be achieved by postponing capital projects, reducing most spending programmes, slimming the cabinet and retrenching 14,000 public servants by mid-1993. Subsidies are due to be cut by 45 per cent. Businessmen already question whether Mr Chidzero can deliver his promise, partly because he is locked into heavy debt-service expenditure as a result of past fiscal follies. Interest charges will absorb about 20 per cent of total spending this year after devaluation and the rise in interest rates. When education (22 per cent), defence (14 per cent) and health (6.5 per cent) are taken into account, there is scant room for manoeuvre. Had the tough fiscal and monetary medicine been imposed sooner rather than at a time of severe drought-induced deflation, the economy would have been far better able to withstand the difficulties. President Robert Mugabe's government is half way through its third term in office and must go to the polls early in 1995. By then living standards in Zimbabwe will be no higher than at independence 15 years previously and lower than in the 1975 boom during Mr Ian Smith's unilateral independence regime. If drought can be blamed for part of this dismal performance, the World Bank repeatedly affirms that ill-conceived economic policies and weak economic management are ultimately to blame. With no viable political opposition in sight, Mr Mugabe must take risks now if he is to win in 1995. But there is little in the government's record on public spending to justify the belief that this time Mr Chidzero really means what he says.</p>

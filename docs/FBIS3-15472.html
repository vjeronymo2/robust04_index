			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Petrenko] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 4 TASS -- A statement of Central Bank  Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko that "controlled inflation is  better than large-scale unemployment" is a false dilemma,  Director of the Institute of Transitional Economy Yegor Gaydar  told ITAR-TASS here today.    In his opinion, unemployment can be kept in check for  two-five months with higher inflation and monetary injections,  but this course has no long-term prospects.    "If the economy is not stable and there is no stable money,  unemployment will increase anyway and we will have an unpleasant  combination of jobless and high inflation," said Gaydar.    Speaking of the draft budget, he noted the difference  between  the message's indices and the ones named today by the prime  minister. In his opinion, the main difference is approaches to  the inflation -- a key aspect of the 1994 economic policy. They  are rather qualitative than quantitative. The presidential  message inspires hope for an economic breakthrough and stability  and the government indices are not optimistic.    The budget deficit is estimated at approximately 10.2 per  cent of the gross domestic product, the level of 1993, which  means the inflation will not decrease.    Gaydar personally would not vote for the document until  certain changes are introduced in its spending section. The  draft provides for doubled spending on the state machinery and  the military-industrial complex simultaneously with the reduced  social spending.</p>

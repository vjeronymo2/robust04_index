			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (6): Bristol will regain unitary status - Local government review is ready to axe Avon council In Avon House, a block of brutal architecture in Bristol which is the headquarters of Avon county council, the lifts have an automatic voice intoning: 'Doors closing.' Soon, the doors will close on Avon council itself. Its abolition is one of the few near-certainties of the local government review in England. Subject to parliamentary orders, there will be shadow elections next May to four new unitary authorities, replacing the existing two-tier structure of six district councils and the county council, which will disappear in 1996. Bristol will then regain the unitary status it lost 20 years ago in the last reorganisation of local authorities. While there is broad agreement this will benefit the city, there is disappointment that the government appears to have accepted the local government commission's recommendation to confine the new council to the city's historic boundaries. The conurbation has expanded well beyond those boundaries, notably to the north. The city council believes that, in strategic and planning terms, the new authority should have a wider remit. This view is backed by business groups. Mr Chris Curtis, director of the regional Confederation of British Industry, says: 'We believe the curtailment of Bristol to historic boundaries is a serious mistake - a lot of companies will continue to face a confused planning process, and possibly worse. Services are still continuing to move out of Bristol, and the wealth-creating potential of historic Bristol is declining and its capacity to deal with deprivation is being curtailed.' Instead, the local government commission, chaired by Sir John Banham, has attached more importance to the views of residents in outlying areas who are opposed to a Bristol 'takeover.' In consequence, Northavon district council will merge with Kingswood to form South Gloucestershire, Bath city council will merge with its neighbouring district Wansdyke, to form Bath and north-east Somerset. Woodspring, which is based around Weston-super-Mare, will become North-west Somerset on its existing boundaries. Uncertainties remain over the transfer of powers. Avon council is by far the largest employer in the county, with the equivalent of more than 21,000 full-time employees and a budget of nearly Pounds 600m. However, nearly all the staff are expected to transfer to the new authorities. In Bristol, there is anxiety that the city council will not be given adequate resources to cope with its new status. The council argues that its present standard spending assessment has been inadequate. It points out that a government-commissioned study ranks the city as the 42nd most deprived district out of 366 district authorities. The combined assessment of Bristol and Avon councils this year is Pounds 697 per head of population, compared with Pounds 817 for Coventry, which was ranked the 45th most deprived. The city council, supported by many businesses and organisations, is lobbying for the assessment to be increased. One issue is that Bristol, by being the regional capital, provides services which those living in outlying areas use but do not support through their council taxes. The Bristol Cultural Development Partnership says the city's current assessment 'is more akin to a minor district than a regional centre.' It fears the situation could become even more worse when the city takes on responsibilities at present funded by the county council. It says the county council is spending Pounds 400,000 this year on supporting independent arts groups. Nearly all of these arts activities are Bristol-based. If, under the reorganisation, Avon's budget is disaggregated on a population basis, then the city would face big problems in supporting artistic and cultural activities. Avon council itself is resigned to the fact that the government is determined to abolish it. Although, in strategic terms, its creation in 1974 made more sense than the restriction this time of Bristol to its historic boundaries, it is widely regarded as ineffectual and has failed to generate any popular support. For many years it has been a hung council - the present make-up is Labour 34, Conservatives 25 and Liberal Democrats 17. While there is a danger of further indecision in the period leading up to its abolition, Mr Graham Badman, director of education who has been also appointed head of external affairs to oversee the handover, stresses that for months the council has been working with district councils to prepare for abolition. One of the internal notes refers to 'wind-down to ensure clean handover.' Once that has happened, there will be few reminders of the old county except in such bodies as the Avon and Somerset Constabulary.</p>

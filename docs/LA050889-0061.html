			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO PROTESTS SEEN DURING GORBACHEV TOUR;  </P> <P> BEIJING STUDENTS PLAN TO REFRAIN WHILE SOVIET LEADER VISITS CHINA  </P> <P> Students who twice paralyzed Beijing with mass demonstrations said Sunday they  are likely to refrain from protests during the visit to China next week by  Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a man they champion as a Communist  reformer.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's historic visit will mark a significant reduction in 30 years of  tension between the two Communist countries, and students said that trouble  during the visit would be a terrible loss of face for China.  </P> <P> "The visit is too important for our country," said a student at Teachers  University. "We are a patriotic, democratic movement, so we would not do  anything against our country."  </P> <P> Last Thursday, despite stern official warnings, tens of thousands of  pro-democracy protesters paralyzed the capital during a meeting of the Asian  Development Bank, and some activists suggested the same could happen when the  Soviet leader arrives May 15.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'We Do Not March Just for Fun'  </P> <P> "We reserve the right to protest during Gorbachev's visit, but our goal is not  to demonstrate, and we do not march just for fun," said a student leader from  the central city of Xian who came to Beijing to meet with fellow activists.  </P> <P> "If the government is sensible, it will agree to have talks with us, as our  conditions are reasonable," she added.  </P> <P> Many students involved in three weeks of unrest said the Soviet leader  represents a younger, reformist and more open style of government, in direct  contrast with that of China's 84-year-old paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping.  </P> <P> "What China needs is someone like Gorbachev. His thinking is clear and good," a  student union organizer told reporters last week.  </P> <P> "I think Gorbachev is a great, amazing political star and a considerable  theoretician," said a student at the University of Politics and Law. "I welcome  him to come and visit my university, as we really pay a lot of attention to his  reforms."  </P> <P> The editor of a youth magazine said someone like Gorbachev is needed to battle  China's entrenched bureaucracy.  </P> <P> "Chinese intellectuals admire Gorbachev and wish we had such a person. It takes  someone with a lot of spirit to carry reforms through," he said.  </P> <P> But activists said their demands for an end to official corruption, democratic  reforms in the government and an open and free press are not an imitation of  reforms in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "Our ideas come from the Chinese people, and it is the ordinary people who are  standing behind us, that is all," said Ni Xu, a former student-union committee  member.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Splits in Movement  </P> <P> Organizing another major demonstration on the scale of Thursday's would be  difficult because of splits within the movement, students said.  </P> <P> While many of the students at about 50 universities in the capital who took  part in a two-week classroom strike said they will return to class today,  students at Beijing University voted Saturday night to continue their protest.  </P> <P> A new student organization made up of representatives, primarily graduate  students, from 24 universities has given the government a conciliatory petition  asking for dialogue.  </P> <P> "We want dialogue. We are not considering other methods or other activities,"  leader Xiang Xiaoji told reporters when asked if his group favors  demonstrations.  </P> <P> "The government is not our adversary," he said.  </P> <P> A prominent intellectual warned against official complacency if the student  unrest dies down.  </P> <P> "If students return to class, but the deep problems in Chinese reform are not  settled . . . the problems the students have pointed out this year will come  back again," Yan Jiaqi, director of the political science institute of the  Academy of Social Science, said in an article in China Youth News.  </P></p>

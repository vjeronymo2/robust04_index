			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE  </P> <P> Daum-Johnstown American -- which also landed in the news recently -- said it  has moved its Newport Beach office to larger quarters in Irvine.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles commercial real estate broker, Daum made news late last year when  50 or so of its employees and brokers -- who work on contract -- left the  Anaheim office to join a competitor.  </P> <P> The brokerage took 9,000 square feet in a 12-story building at 1920 Main St. in  Koll Center Irvine North. Daum contends it's doing fine and just needed more  space.  </P> <P> Brokers there said they recently closed one fair-size deal: The purchase of two  industrial buildings near John Wayne Airport by RHB Investments of Beverly  Hills from Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Co. for $6.2 million.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> JURY FINDS MAN GUILTY IN '81 MURDER OF WOMAN  </P> <P> A Tustin man was convicted Thursday of murder in the 1981 death of an  18-year-old Carson woman whose body has never been found.  </P> <P> Relatives of Tracy Lee Stewart wept as the six-man, six-woman jury in Los  Angeles Superior Court declared Robert Wayne Beckett Jr. guilty of killing her  on Aug. 9, 1981.  </P> <P> Beckett, 28, wearing jeans and cowboy boots and shackled at the feet, showed no  emotion as the verdict was read. But he laughed and joked with bailiffs as he  was led out of the courtroom.  </P> <P> Sentencing has been delayed pending a probation report, which is due Aug. 31.  He could be sentenced to 25 years to life in state prison.  </P> <P> In December, 1988, Beckett and his father, Robert Beckett Sr., were charged  with the woman's murder. But after the son backed out of an agreement to  testify against his father, Beckett Sr. was released, Deputy Dist. Atty. Dale  Davidson said.  </P> <P> Beckett Jr. was the last person seen with Stewart, when he picked her up at her  Carson residence for a date and drove to his father's Torrance-area home. His  arrest came after his conviction in 1985 for felonious assault on a woman  friend in Colorado, for which he served two years there. While in prison,  Beckett talked to authorities about a murder in Carson, and detectives  eventually were able to connect him with Stewart's disappearance, according to  law enforcement authorities.  </P> <P> Stewart telephoned her parents on the day of the murder to tell them that she  was on a date with someone named Robbie, authorities said. She was never seen  again.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Gu Ping (0657 1627): "Russia and the `Partnership for </F> Peace'"]    [Text] Recently, Russia has spoken in different voices on  whether or not it will join NATO's "partnership for peace"  program. By announcing on 6 April that Russia would join the  program in the near future, President Yeltsin temporarily put an  end to the argument in Russia. It is reported that Russia is  likely to sign the program's framework agreement on 21 April.    The "partnership for peace" program was approved at a NATO  summit meeting early this year. Its main contents are: NATO  will not be expanded for the time being, but will establish a  partnership with countries in Eastern Europe and the  Commonwealth of Independent States [CIS] so that they can "make  a gradual transition toward NATO member status."    Russia welcomes the NATO "partnership for peace" program,  holding that it will prevent another split in Europe, but that  it is not fully in keeping with Russia's interests. The Russian  Government is sharply divergent on whether it should join the  program. The Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry hold:  Russia cannot prevent NATO from developing relations with East  European countries. If Russia disregards this reality, it will  be excluded from the new European security system.  Participation in the program will be conducive to coordinating  its relations with the United States and other Western countries  and it can transform this program internally to make it conform  to Russia's interest. Russian parliamentary leaders and others,  however, are opposed to hurriedly joining the NATO mechanism on  the grounds that it is out of keeping with Russia's status as a  big power and that it will probably result in Russia losing its  room for diplomatic maneuvering and its right to carry out arms  trade and hamper strategic cooperation within the CIS. The  parliament's International Affairs Commission approved a  resolution saying that only when NATO accords Russia "special  status" will it join the program.    Under such circumstances, while announcing that Russia would  join the program, President Yeltsin emphatically pointed out:  Russia's partnership with NATO should "be in keeping with  Russia's status and role in world and European affairs and with  Russia's military strength and nuclear status" and "be different  from other countries' relations with NATO in terms of scope and  contents." Judging by the Russian leader's statement, the  "special status" Russia is seeking in the NATO program generally  includes the following aspects: allowing Russia to attend NATO  membership meetings and join in making important policy  decisions; recognizing Russia's "special responsibilities"  toward the former Soviet region; and taking into consideration  Russia's interest on such issues as military transformation and  defense structures. Moreover, Russia also wants to link its  participation in "partnership for peace" with its participation  in the G-7 economic group so as to get more economic aid.    Russia's demand for a "special relationship" poses a  difficult problem for NATO. Acceding to its demand is  tantamount to a recognition that the CIS belongs to Russia's  sphere of influence, thus upsetting the course of Eastern  European states joining the program. Poland, the Czech  Republic, and Ukraine have warned NATO that "accommodating  Russia" is likely to scuttle the entire "partnership for peace"  program.    In fact, NATO and Russia have their own axes to grind. The  United States and its allies are attempting to fill the  "security vacuum" in Eastern Europe and establish a new system  of European security, with NATO as the nucleus. Russia,  however, is worried that NATO will place Eastern Europe in its  sphere of influence and thus threaten Russia's security  interests. Therefore, it wants to maintain Eastern Europe as a  buffer zone, with Russia and the West guaranteeing its security.  It wants to develop a partnership for Europe as a whole through  the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the  North Atlantic Cooperation Council. This actually reflects the  strategic differences between the two parties. Consequently,  even if Russia signs the "partnership for peace" program, it  will still bargain hard with the West about the essence of this  program.</p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Redland resumes attack on Steetley's European quarries REDLAND, which this week expects to hear that it can proceed with its Pounds 600m contested bid for rival UK building materials group Steetley, yesterday resumed its attack on the quality of Steetley's continental European aggregate business. Mr Peter Lilley, the trade secretary, is expected to announce within the next few days that Redland has given sufficient undertakings - to dispose of businesses where it would acquire a dominant market position  - to allow the takeover to proceed. Redland has offered to sell two brick plants in south-east England and to dispose of Steetley's clay tile operations if its offer for the company succeeds. Under takeover panel rules, Steetley must publish its final defence document within two days of the bid being cleared by Mr Lilley. Redland, which has hired external consultants to investigate Steetley's quarries in France and Spain, said yesterday that the Spanish reserves were lower than Steetley had implied when it bought the business in 1988. The group said that inspection of the sites, geological studies and interviews with local people had revealed that the Spanish reserves were no more than 30m tonnes. Of this, only half was likely to get planning permission because some of the sites would be affected by plans to establish a nature reserve in the area. When it announced the purchase of five connected companies in the Madrid area for Pounds 24.6m Steetley said there were 30 years of proven sand and gravel reserves at current production rates. Redland said that this had implied reserves of at least 48m tonnes. It estimated that Steetley had earned profits of Pounds 7m on its Spanish businesses last year 'despite having invested between Pounds 60m and Pounds 70m in Spain since 1988.' Last week Redland also claimed that Steetley's French aggregate reserves were also much less than the group had previously indicated. Mr Richard Miles, Steetley's chief executive, said last night: 'This increasingly strident barrage of asset bashing is a deliberately misleading attempt at scaring our shareholders into parting with their assets on the cheap. It of course avoids mention of Steetley management's proven ability to deliver above-average earnings.' He said Steetley would provide a breakdown of its asset value and earnings potential 'at the appropriate time, and not before.'</p>

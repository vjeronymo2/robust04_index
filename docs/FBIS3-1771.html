			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- Following is the  full text of "Facts About a Few Important Aspects of  Sino-British Talks on 1994/95 Electoral Arrangements in Hong  Kong" made public by a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman here  today:    From April to November 1993, the representatives of the  Chinese and British Governments held 17 rounds of talks on the  arrangements for the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong. Before the  talks started, the two sides reached an understanding on  confidentiality of the contents of the talks. Now, without  prior consultations with the Chinese side, the British side has  published in the white paper entitled Representative Government  in Hong Kong, by which it has unilaterally released the contents  of the talks, and in which it has distorted and attacked China's  position. This move of Britain was designed to shirk its  responsibility for the rupture of the talks. The Chinese side  therefore cannot but bring to light the facts in order to help  people know the truth.   <H3>    The British Side Stubbornly Clung to the Constitutional  Package Which Contravened the Joint Declaration, The Principle  of Convergence with the Basic Law and the Agreements and  Understandings Reached Between the Two Sides </H3>   The 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong are to produce the  three-tier political structure -- the Hong Kong Legislative  Council, Urban and Regional Councils and district boards. The  Hong Kong Legislative Council was established according to  letters patent. In the long history of over 140 years after its  institution in 1843, all its members were appointed by the  governor of Hong Kong. In 1985 after the Sino-British Joint  Declaration was signed, it began to have indirectly elected  members and in 1991 direct elections started. In the current  60-member Legislative Council, 3 were official members, 18 were  appointed by the governor, 18 directly elected from geographical  constituencies, and 21 indirectly from functional constituencies.    The Joint Declaration between the government of the People's  Republic of China and the Government of the United Kingdom of  Great Britain and Northern Ireland on the question of Hong Kong  signed in 1984 contains explicit stipulations for the  development of the political structure in Hong Kong. Since then  the Chinese side spent four years and eight months in drafting  the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of  the People's Republic of China on the basis of extensively  soliciting opinions of the Hong Kong people and subsequently  promulgated it. Meanwhile, the two sides discussed specific  matters concerning the development of the political structure in  Hong Kong, and reached a series of agreements, understandings  and consensus. The Basic Law was well received by the general  public in Hong Kong. The British side also made commitments on  several occasions to convergence of the development of the  political structure in Hong Kong with the Basic Law before 1997.    However, in his first policy address delivered in October  1992 after he took office, Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten  proposed a constitutional package, which spelled out, among  other things, specific arrangements for the 1994/95 elections.  The package contravened the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the  principle of convergence with the Basic Law and agreements and  understandings already reached between the two sides both in its  contents and in the way it was produced.    Annex II of the Joint Declaration stipulates that the  Chinese and British Governments should enhance cooperation in  the second half of the transitional period in Hong Kong and  jointly work out measures to ensure a smooth transition leading  to 1997. As the 1994/95 elections will have a direct bearing on  the transition, there must be agreement between the Chinese and  British Governments on the electoral arrangements through  consultations. Before October 1992, the Chinese side had  suggested that the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group begin at an  early date its consultation on this issue. However, without  prior consultations with the Chinese side, the British side  suddenly and unilaterally made public a constitutional package  in gross violation of the above-mentioned provisions of the  Joint Declaration.    The Basic Law states that the political structure in Hong  Kong shall develop "in accordance with the principles of gradual  and orderly progress" and "in the light of the actual situation"  there. Annex II of the Basic Law and the relevant decision of  the National People's Congress set out clearly the specific  ratio and number of directly elected members of the first,  second and third Legislative Councils of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region to be gradually increased. Chris Patten,  however, has introduced in its package drastic changes to the  existing political structure in Hong Kong and attempted to apply  direct elections to all the members of the Legislative Council  in 1995 in disguise. The package has also tried to change the  nature of the election by functional constituencies and  contained proposals obviously contradictory to the Basic Law on  many specific issues.    This package has also contravened the series of agreements,  understandings and consensus already reached between the two  sides, especially those reached by the exchange of letters  between the two foreign ministers in early 1990.    After it was made public, the package naturally met with  strong opposition from the Chinese Government and provoked sharp  criticism among Hong Kong people. Under these circumstances,  the British Government was forced to ask for talks with the  Chinese Government on the 1994/95 electoral arrangements in Hong  Kong. Proceeding from the overall interests of effecting a  smooth transition and maintaining prosperity and stability in  Hong Kong, the Chinese Government agreed to such talks with it  and the two sides reached agreement on the basis for talks, i.e.  Observance of the Joint Declaration, the principle of  convergence with the Basic Law and the agreements and  understandings already reached between the two sides or the  three principles in short.    The Chinese side wished to see agreement reached in the  talks  at an earlier date so as to realize a smooth transition and  smooth transfer of government in Hong Kong in 1997 through  cooperation between China and Britain. To this end, the Chinese  side made unremitting efforts in the talks.    During the first three rounds of the talks, the Chinese side  made it plain that as the two sides had agreed upon the three  principles as the basis for the talks, it believed it important  for the British side to first of all confirm the agreements,  understandings and consensus previously reached between the two  sides, for this was the only way to enable the talks to move on  the right track. If it was reluctant to do so and wanted to  amend or overturn them, then it would be impossible to ensure  compliance of future agreements. Therefore, the Chinese side  produced an eight-point text which it wished to be confirmed  (see Annex I). The British side had all along refused to  confirm some of the agreements and understandings already  reached between the two sides. For the rest, it tried to avoid  confirming their substance by paying lip service with no  intention to observe and implement them when it came to concrete  matters.    In the rounds four to nine of the talks, the Chinese side  put forward proposals on several major issues in accordance with  the three principles. It proposed to focus on the electoral  arrangements for district boards and municipal councils before  moving on to discuss the 1995 Legislative Council elections.  But it was rejected by the British side. During this period,  the British side moved to offer some new views different from  Chris Patten's package. But in essence, it stuck to the  substance of the package on some major issues.    From the 10th to the 13th round of talks, the Chinese side  made further adjustments to its proposal in order to push  forward the talks. But as the British side refused to reverse  its position of contravening the three principles, the talks  progressed rather slowly. Vice Premier and Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen once again proposed during his meeting with Foreign  Secretary Douglas Hurd in New York in October 1993 that the  electoral arrangements for the district organizations, i.e. the  district boards and two municipal councils, and for the  Legislative Council should be discussed in two phases.    Starting from the 14th round, the Chinese side once again  called for separate discussions of the electoral arrangements  for the district organizations and for the 1995 Legislative  Council and spelt out its views. The British side agreed to  China's proposal at first. But when the two sides were close to  an agreement, it insisted on including the voting method for the  1995 Legislative Council into the understanding on the electoral  arrangements for district organizations. When its unreasonable  demand was rejected by the Chinese side, it unilaterally  discontinued the talks at the 17th round and submitted to the  Legislative Council part of the question under discussion  between the two sides, which directly led to the termination of  the talks.   <H3>    The British Side Attempted To Interfere in the Affairs  Falling Within the Scope of China's Sovereignty </H3>   The topic of the Sino-British talks was arrangements for the  1994/95 elections in Hong Kong. This was first proposed by the  British side and then agreed upon by the two sides. This was  also the objective of the talks. However, at the outset and  later, the British side insisted on discussing with China the  following three issues: There should be consultation between  the two sides about Hong Kong membership of the Preparatory  Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR];  the Chinese Government would support universal suffrage for the  election of the Legislative Council in 2007, if that was the  wish of the Hong Kong SAR; and the method of forming the  election committee in 1995 should be used for the future  selection committee for the first chief executive of the Hong  Kong SAR and election committees for its subsequent chief  executives.    The Chinese side made it clear that all the three issues  raised by the British side went beyond the arrangements for the  1994/95 elections in Hong Kong and should therefore not be  covered by the talks.    With regard to election of all members of the Legislative  Council of the Hong Kong SAR by universal suffrage after 2007,  Article 68 of the Basic Law and Paragraph 3 of its Annex II  contain provisions to this effect (see Annex II). It is a  question to be decided by the Hong Kong SAR itself and it needs  no guarantee by the Chinese Government. As for the 1995  election committee as the model, the selection committee for  producing the first chief executive of the Hong Kong SAR and  election committees for its subsequent chief executive have  different functions from those of the election committee which  would elect members of the Legislative Council in 1995. The  decision of the National People's Congress [NPC] on the method  for the formation of the first government and the first  Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region adopted in April 1990 (see Annex III) and Annex I of the  Basic Law (see Annex IV) have all clearly provided for how to  produce the selection committee for the first chief executive  and the election committees for the subsequent chief executives.  To replace or revise the relevant provisions is out of the  question. On the question of consultation between the two sides  on Hong Kong members of the preparatory committee, it is  entirely within China's sovereignty to organize the said  preparatory committee. According to the relevant NPC decision,  the chairman and members of the preparatory committee to be set  up in 1996, including those from Hong Kong, should be appointed  by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.    Apparently, the Basic Law and the NPC decisions have  explicit  provisions for all the three issues. They are matters within  China's sovereignty. The motive of the British side in raising  these questions is obvious.    Agreements and Understandings Reached Between the Two  Sides on the Election Committee Must Be Observed    In early 1990, the foreign ministers of China and Britain  exchanged seven messages on how to make the 1995 Hong Kong  Legislative Council elections converge with the Basic Law so as  to guarantee a smooth transition in 1997 and reached agreements  and understandings on a series of issues, including the  composition and ratio of the election committee. With regard to  the election committee for 1995, Foreign Minister Qian made it  clear in his letter dated 8 February 1990 that "the provisions  on the composition and ratio of the election committee as  specified in Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law (draft)  must followed, because Annex I was approved by a two-thirds  majority of the membership of the drafting committee at its  eighth plenary session. The Chinese side is of the view that  the above-mentioned composition and ratio are appropriate and  need no alteration." In his letter of reply dated 12 February,  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd agreed with the Chinese  proposal by saying that "I agree in principle with the  arrangements which you propose for an electoral committee, which  could be established in 1995. The precise details of how this  should be done can be discussed between our two sides in due  course." Thus the foreign ministers of the two countries did  reach an unequivocal agreement and understanding on the  composition and ratio of the 1995 election committee.    According to provisions of Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the  Basic Law, the election committee shall be comprised of members  from the following four sectors: the industrial, commercial and  financial sectors; the professionals; the labour, social  services, religious and other sectors; members of the  Legislative Council, representatives of district-based  organizations, Hong Kong deputies to the National People's  Congress, and representatives of Hong Kong members of the  National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference, with each sector taking up one fourth  of the total membership (see Annex IV).    However, Chris Patten's plan proposed that "the 1995  election  committee should draw all or most of the members from the  directly-elected district boards". This directly contradicted  the agreement and understanding reached between the two foreign  ministers in early 1990.    During the talks, the British side flatly denied the fact  that there had been agreement or understanding between the two  sides on the election committee. After patient reasoning by the  Chinese side, it only agreed to part of the Chinese proposal  that the composition and ratio of first three sectors of the  election committee may follow the relevant provisions of  Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law. But it still insisted  that the fourth sector should be composed of representatives of  the district-based organizations in the place of those as set  out in Paragraph 2 of Annex I, which meant a significant change  to Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law.    The election committee should have a broad representation.  This was a common understanding reached between China and  Britain a long time ago. The British side, on its part, was not  opposed to the principle of balanced participation either.  According to its proposal, however, Hong Kong deputies to the  National People's Congress, Hong Kong members of the National  Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference [CPPCC] and members of the Legislative Council would  be completely excluded from the election committee, contrary to  the provisions of Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law. The  election committee composed in such a manner would obviously  impair its broad representation.    The British side insisted all along that "the election  committee should be composed of people who had themselves been  elected... in Hong Kong". Actually it knew full well that with  Hong Kong still under the rule of the British Government before  1997, it was not possible to have the NPC deputies and CPPCC  National Committee members elected in Hong Kong. As provided  for in Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law, Hong Kong  deputies to the NPC and members of the CPPCC National Committee  will all be members of the election committee. Since the term  of the Hong Kong Legislative Council and its members elected in  1995 may extend beyond 1997, the 1995 elections would be  special. Therefore, the Chinese side could not accept exclusion  of the Hong Kong deputies to the NPC and members of the CPPCC  National Committee from the 1995 election committee.    The Chinese side further pointed out that the election  committee was only a transitional arrangement. Its original  purpose was to make it possible for those representative figures  who enjoyed prestige in the society in Hong Kong but were  unwilling to participate in direct elections to serve on the  Legislative Council and play their role there. The election of  the election committee would be indirect, not direct.    The Chinese views and position on the election committee  were  very straight-forward, i.e. to act strictly in accordance with  the agreements and understandings reached between China and  Britain so that conditions could be created for the Legislative  Council of Hong Kong and its members elected in 1995 to become  the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region and its members. The Chinese side offered  its specific views on the election committee as follows: The  election committee would be comprised of members from four  sectors. Representatives of the first three sectors would be  produced by a voting method similar to that of functional  constituencies while the fourth sector would be composed of  members of the Legislative Council, representatives of the  district-based organizations, Hong Kong deputies to the NPC and  representatives of Hong Kong members of the CPPCC National  Committee as prescribed in Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic  Law. Members of the Legislative Council and the representatives  of the district- based organizations mentioned here referred to  those who would be members of the Legislative Council and  representatives of district organizations after the SAR  Government was formed in 1997 and they would not be in place at  the time of the 1995 Legislative Council elections. Therefore,  the Chinese side proposed that they be substituted respectively  by members of the present Legislative Council and the  representatives of the members of the district boards, regional  and urban councils to be elected in 1994/1995.    As for the size of the election committee, the two sides had  never reached any agreement or understanding. The nature and  functions of the election committee that would elect 10 members  of the Legislative Council in 1995 would be different from those  of the selection committee that would produce the first chief  executive of the Hong Kong SAR and those of the election  committees which would produce its subsequent chief executives.  The election committee should have a broad representation and  be easy to organize and operate. In view of all this, the  Chinese side proposed that the desirable size of the 1995  election committee could be around 600. The British side did not  take exception to it.   <H3>    The Original Purpose of Election by Functional  Constituencies Must Be Upheld </H3>   The functional constituencies system was first recommended  to  the Chinese side by the British side. The Chinese side on its  part, taking into account the reality in Hong Kong, accepted  this recommendation by incorporating it into the Basic Law. In  fact, China and Britain had long reached an understanding which  regarded the functional constituencies system as a form of  indirect election. The basic position held by the Chinese side  in the talks was as follows: first, election by functional  constituencies should conform to the original purpose of  introducing this system and the understanding reached by the two  sides thereon. It is indirect election, and must not be turned  into a form of direct election on an occupational basis.  Secondly, the evolution of the system should follow the  principle of gradual development.    On these grounds, the Chinese side suggested during the  talks  that the 1995 elections should follow the principle guiding the  1991 elections. Those which used the corporate voting method  and those which used the individual voting method should  continue to do so. However, according to the British proposal,  corporate voting would be totally abolished. Even the  representatives of corporate bodies would only vote on their own  behalf, rather than on behalf of their corporate bodies. It  wanted to expand the electorate of functional constituencies to  include the entire working population of Hong Kong and thus turn  the system into direct election on an occupational basis. This  approach obviously ran counter to the British Hong Kong  Government's original intention in instituting the functional  constituencies system. It contradicted its own principles and  the understandings reached between the two sides.    The Chinese side also stated that the evolution of the  functional constituencies system should follow the principle of  gradual development. The seats returned by the functional  constituencies would increase from 21 in 1991 to 30 in 1995,  which in itself was a big progress. With the increase of the  number of seats, the electorate of functional constituencies  would surely expand accordingly. Yet the British side insisted  on a drastic expansion of the electorate from less than 100,000  in 1991 to 2.7 million voters in 1995. Its subsequent revised  proposals still aimed to bring up the electorates to 900,000,  which would mean a nine-fold increase. This certainly could not  be termed as "gradual development".    While pointing out the irrationalities of the British  proposal, the Chinese side showed flexibility in order to  advance the talks. With regard to the electorate of functional  constituencies, it agreed to increase the number of corporate  representatives provided that the principle of corporate voting  was adhered to. With regard to the nine new functional  constituencies in 1995, it proposed at an earlier stage of the  talks that they should be: the Hong Kong Chinese enterprises  associations; labour, agriculture and fishery; textiles and  garment; importers and exporters association; kai fong  [neighborhood] welfare associations; insurance; maritime and  sports. Later, to accommodate the views and concerns of the  British side, and to facilitate the talks, the Chinese side made  several adjustments to its own proposal which would have the  following new constituencies: the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises  Association, insurance, labour, agriculture and fishery,  textiles and garment, importers and exporters association,  wholesale and retail, transport, sports, entertainment and  culture. This fully testified to the sincerity and cooperative  spirit of the Chinese side. After a period of talks, the two  sides had narrowed their differences over the electorate  question and had reached a degree of consensus on such specific  questions as what constituencies would have more seats in 1995.  We had expected that the British side would have shown the same  flexibility and cooperative spirit after seriously studying the  Chinese proposal. However, up to the last minute, it still clung  to its basic position which was not in conformity with the  British Hong Kong Government's original intention in instituting  the functional constituencies system, or the "guiding  principles" it had all along vigorously recommended to the  Chinese side, or the reality in Hong Kong and the wish of people  from various walks of life in Hong Kong, or the principle of  "gradual development". Surely, this was not acceptable to the  Chinese side.    Taking account of the special importance of mainland-funded  enterprises to the socio-economic life of Hong Kong, the Chinese  side proposed the forming of a constituency of Hong Kong Chinese  Enterprises Association. As the functional constituencies  system was designed to let those sectors which play an important  role in "maintaining prosperity and confidence in the future of  Hong Kong" have "full representation" in the Legislative  Council. [sentence as received] At present, there are three  main categories of Hong Kong's businesses: foreign invested  businesses, those owned by Hong Kong residents of Chinese  origin, and mainland invested businesses. The first two have  already been represented in the Hong Kong Legislative Council.  Only the last category is not. If the 1995- elected  Legislative Council is to be carried beyond 1997, it would be  unreasonable to discriminate against the mainland-funded  enterprises and deny them of their representation in the new  legislature.    Given the need to strengthen the representation of the  "labour sector" in the Legislative Council though it already had  two seats, the Chinese side proposed that the labour sector be  given one extra seat from the proposed nine new seats. Like the  existing two seats, the electorate of this new seat should  comprise of the more than 400 trade unions registered in Hong  Kong. But the British side, contradicting the original purpose  of forming functional constituencies, tried to lump together  employees of one sector with employers or professionals of  another in an attempt to cause conflict and discord. The  Chinese side believed that this idea proposed by the British  side was undesirable.    The British side proposed a "civil servant sector" in the  ninth round of talks, which was designed to make a fundamental  change in the civil servant system in Hong Kong, undermine the  principle of political neutrality of civil servants and create  confusion and discord among them. This grossly contravened the  principle of convergence with the Basic Law. The British  proposal was rejected by the Chinese side and met with strong  discontent expressed by the Hong Kong people, including the  civil servants. The British side had to give up this proposal  in the end.    The British side repeatedly asserted that the irregularities  in the 1991 functional constituency elections were due to the  use of corporate voting and that by changing all the corporate  voting into individual voting these irregularities could be  redressed. This is not a convincing argument. In relation to  the problems which cropped up in the functional constituencies  for the regional council election in 1991, the Chinese side  pointed out: 1) the regional council was rather special  functional constituency with only 36 constituents and would  remain so in the 1995 elections; 2) this constituency voted by  individuals during the 1991 election. The British side was  trying to blame corporate voting for the irregularities caused  by individual voting. The incongruity is clear for all to see.  What is more, whatever problems which may occur in the course  of elections should be resolved in a realistic manner and should  not be used as a pretext to change the original purpose and  special role of functional constituencies. Even the British  proposal could not solve the problem it raised.    The Question of Through Train Can Only Be Solved  Within the Framework of the NPC Decision and Basic Law    The so-called "through train" mainly means that members of  Hong Kong's last Legislative Council may become, upon  confirmation by the Hong Kong SAR Preparatory Committee, member  of the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR of the  People's Republic of China upon China's resumption of the  exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on 1 July 1997. The  decision adopted by the National People's Congress in April 1990  prescribes in Article 6 that: "If the composition of the last  Hong Kong Legislative Council before the establishment of the  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is in conformity with  the relevant provisions of this decision and the Basic Law of  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, those of its  members who uphold the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China and  pledge allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region  of the People's Republic of China, and who meet the requirements  set forth in the Basic Law of the region may, upon confirmation  by the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region, become members of the first Legislative  Council of the region."    It is clear that there are explicit provisions for the  criteria for the confirmation of the Legislative Council  members. The NPC decision makes it clear that the composition  of the last Legislative Council through the 1995 elections  should conform to the NPC decision and the relevant provisions  of the Basic Law. Otherwise, "conformation" of these members  would be out of the question. The Chinese side proposed that  the two sides first consider and agree on the question of  conformity between the "composition" and the relevant provisions  of the NPC decision and the Basic Law, for it was of crucial  importance to the discussion of the confirmation of the  Legislative Council members. To discuss the question of  conformation before it was determined that the composition of  the Legislative Council conformed with the Basic Law and the NPC  decision, as insisted by the British side, would be illogical  and make the discussion devoid of the necessary basis.    The British side considered the criteria set forth in the  NPC  decision not objective and clear enough. So it proposed its  own. It believed that a pledge of allegiance as required by  Article 104 of the Basic Law would be sufficient for a member of  the 1995 elected Legislative Council to continue to serve on the  first SAR legislature. On more than one occasions, the British  side stated that it had no intention to deprive the preparatory  committee of its functions as set forth in the NPC decision, to  trespass the constitutional power of the NPC and the preparatory  committee, or to alter or revise the provisions of the Basic Law  or the NPC decision, nor had it any intention to seek transition  of all or some of the members of the Legislative Council.    In the interest of a smooth transition, the Chinese side  agreed that members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council under  British rule, upon confirmation by the preparatory committee,  could automatically become members of the first Legislative  Council of the Hong Kong SAR of the People's Republic of China  in 1997. Given the different nature of the two governments  before and after 30 June 1997, there was no precedent to the  Chinese agreement. It fully testified to the sincerity of the  Chinese side for cooperation. The Chinese side held that the  confirmation of members of parliament should reflect the  principle of the state sovereignty and there were clear-cut  provisions in the decision of the National People's Congress on  criteria for confirmation. In the NPC decision the task of  confirming the members of the Legislative Council was entrusted  to the Hong Kong SAR Preparatory Committee to be set up in 1996.  The Chinese side could only act in accordance with the  provisions in the Basic Law and the NPC decision and was not in  a position to amend them, for it should not infringe upon the  power of confirming the members of the Legislative Council  vested in the preparatory committee by the National People's  Congress.    In the view of the Chinese side, the British proposal that a  mere oral statement by the 1995 elected members of the  Legislative Council would be sufficient to make them members of  the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR was in effect  designed to strip the preparatory committee of the power of  confirmation and render the confirmation meaningless. The  British position also contradicted its own statements. Article  104 of the Basic Law contained provisions on the normal  procedures that the chief executive, principal officials,  members of the Executive Council and of the Legislative Council  of the Hong Kong SAR must go through when assuming office. It  had nothing to do with the terms for confirming the members of  the Legislative Council. Continued service of members of the  Legislative Council on the first Legislative Council of the Hong  Kong SAR was a matter involving two governments different in  nature, and members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council could  become members of the first Legislative Council only after being  confirmed by the preparatory committee. Prior to this, they  were not qualified to go through procedures of oath taking  according to Article 104 of the Basic Law. Therefore, the oath  taking procedures cannot substitute confirmation of members of  the Legislative Council by the preparatory committee.    In brief, the Chinese side could only discuss with the  British side the confirmation issue within the context of the  Basic Law and the relevant NPC decisions. The Chinese side took  note of the wish of the British side that the Chinese side make  an explanation of the criteria for confirmation and  recommendations to the relevant bodies. It expressed its  willingness to explore an appropriate solution within the  context of the Basic Law and the NPC decisions. To this end,  the Chinese side offered some explanatory remarks on the  criteria for confirmation contained in the NPC decision. It  spelled out as follows: members of the first Legislative  Council of the Hong Kong SAR of the People's Republic of China  must (1) pledge allegiance to the Hong Kong SAR of the People's  Republic of China; (2) love China and love Hong Kong, uphold and  abide by the Basic Law, support the resumption by the People's  Republic of China of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong  as of 1 July 1997 and be committed to a smooth transition and  transfer of government in Hong Kong in 1997 and its long-term  prosperity and stability; (3) support the principle of "one  country, two systems." Any act of violating the Basic Law,  participation or playing a leading role in any action aimed at  subverting the central government of China or changing the  socialist system in the mainland would be regarded as failure to  uphold and abide by the Basic Law and contravening the principle  of "one country, two systems". (4) Meet the requirements set  out in the relevant provisions of the Basic Law. For example, a  member of the first Legislative Council must be a permanent  resident of Hong Kong and should not have committed any criminal  offense.    It was in the spirit of seeking a settlement that the  Chinese  side put forward the above views. In fact, the talks between  the two sides on the "through train" was still going on, and the  two sides could have continued their exchange of views and  worked out an appropriate solution. But the British side used  the media under its control to publicly distort the views of the  Chinese side outside the talks. A thorough and balanced study  of the Chinese explanations would have enabled one to come to a  just conclusion.   <H3>    The Chinese Side Made Tremendous Efforts for Agreement on  Arrangements for District Organization Elections </H3>   To push forward the talks, the Chinese side put forward a  proposal as early as the fourth round of the talks that the two  sides first reach agreement on the arrangements for the  elections of the district boards and municipal councils and then  move on to the discussions on the arrangements for the  Legislative Council elections in 1995. This proposal was not  accepted by the British side. In the discussions that followed,  it refused to move away from Chris Patten's constitutional  package, which was the cause of slow progress in the talks. In  order to achieve a breakthrough, Vice Premier and Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen, during his meeting with British Foreign  Secretary Douglas Hurd in New York on 1 October 1993, once again  proposed to discuss and settle the question of arrangements for  the district organization elections first. Mr. Qian said in  explicit terms: As matters related to the district organization  elections are relatively easy and time is pressing, the two  sides may discuss them first and try to reach agreement. The  1995 Legislative Council elections are more complicated and  there is still some time left to allow the two sides to discuss  them at a later stage. This was what the Chinese side meant by  separating discussions on the two phases of the elections in  accordance with the principle of "starting from the easier part  and then moving on to the more difficult part". On that  occasion, the British side did not express agreement. During  the thirteenth round, it said it could accept the proposal on  condition that the voting age be lowered from 21 to 18, the  voting methods proposed by the British side be adopted and  appointed membership be abolished. While welcoming the  long-awaited British agreement to discuss arrangements for the  district organization elections first, the Chinese side pointed  out that to set preconditions was not a constructive approach.    The Chinese side raised three major issues of concern at  the preliminary stage of the discussions on the arrangements for  district organization elections:    1. In the last few years of the transitional period, the  nature of the district boards and municipal councils as not  being organs of political power and their current functions  should remain unchanged so as to converge with the relevant  provisions of the Basic Law.    2. In order to converge with the Basic Law, the Chinese side  asked the British side to amend the relevant provisions in the  Hong Kong election ordinance so as to enable Hong Kong deputies  to Chinese people's congresses at various levels to stand for  elections in Hong Kong.    After long procrastination, the British side finally agreed  to this request.    3. Appointed membership in the district organizations. Both  the chairmen and the members of the district boards and  municipal councils were opposed to the total abolition of the  appointed membership. In view of this wish of the people of  Hong Kong and considering the actual operation of the district  boards and municipal councils, the Chinese side believed that to  keep the appointed seats was in conformity with Hong Kong's  reality and could enable those concerned to play a positive role  in safeguarding the welfare of the residents of their districts.  It therefore maintained that the existing appointed seats in  both the district boards and municipal councils should be kept.  The British side, however, insisted on a total abolition of all  these seats on the ground that the appointed membership of the  Legislative Council would be abolished in 1995. The Chinese  sides said that there was no automatic link between the  appointed membership in the district boards and municipal  councils and the Legislative Council elections, because the two  were different both in nature and functions. Nevertheless, in  order to move the talks forward, the Chinese side offered to be  flexible to a certain extent on the proportion of the appointed  seats provided that the British side agree in principle to  maintain the appointed membership. The British side refused to  make any concession. In face of this situation, the Chinese  side made another effort by agreeing to reduce the proportion of  the appointed seats from the current figure of over one third to  one fourth of the total members in accordance with the principle  of gradual development. Again it was rejected by the British  side. Considering that this was the only difference left between  the two sides on the 1994 elections and desiring to reach an  early agreement with the British side on the district  organization elections, the Chinese side put forward at the  fifteenth round another proposal which accommodated the  positions of the two sides and bypassed their difference.  According to this proposal, the two sides would state in an  understanding: "The British side stands for the abolition of the  appointed membership in the district boards and the municipal  councils in the 1994/95 elections while the Chinese side stands  for the maintenance of an appropriate proportion of the  appointed seats. The number of appointed seats in the district  boards and municipal councils will be left to Hong Kong SAR  Government to determine, on its own, after 30 June 1997 in  accordance with the provisions of Article 98 of the Basic Law."  In fact, by this proposal, the British side did not have to  retain appointed seats before 30 June 1997 and after that date  the Hong Kong SAR Government may, in accordance with the  provisions of the Basic Law, retain an appropriate proportion of  appointed seats as the people of Hong Kong had wished. This  proposal of the Chinese side was entirely positive and  constructive.    During the discussions on appointed membership in district  organizations, the Chinese sides also expressed agreement to  lowering the voting age from 21 to 18 and indicated that it  would take no exception to the "single seat, single vote" system  proposed by the British side for the district board and  municipal council elections. This shows that the Chinese side  had actually accepted most of the British proposals on the three  issues of voting age, voting methods and appointed membership in  relation to the district board and municipal council elections.  Since two other related questions were basically resolved,  i.e., confirming that the nature and functions of the district  organizations would remain unchanged and commitment to remove  provisions barring Hong Kong deputies to the Chinese people's  congresses at various levels from standing for elections, the  two sides were close to agreement on all issues related to the  arrangements for the district organization elections. If the  British side had the minimum sincerity, the two sides would have  been able to reach agreement on this question after the  fifteenth round of the talks.    What the British side did was to raise new demands in its  response to the Chinese proposal through diplomatic channels  before the sixteenth round. It asserted that the "single seat,  single vote" voting method for the district board and municipal  council elections must also be applied to the geographical  elections for the 1995 Legislative Council. The Chinese side  pointed out that it was inappropriate to include this point in  the present agreement. The Chinese side had made major  concessions to the British side on the three questions of  concern to it related to the district organization elections.  Now the British side raised new issues. It was really going  too far.    During the sixteenth and seventeenth rounds, the British  side insisted on including the provision that the Legislative  Council elections would also use the "single seat, single vote"  method in the memorandum of understanding on the arrangements  for the district organization elections. It explained that by  insisting on this method in the Legislative Council elections,  it wished to have a balanced agreement out of both practical and  political considerations. The Chinese side believed, however,  that none of the British explanations was tenable.    1. To address the British concern about "balance", the  Chinese side submitted to the British side the draft text of a  verbal understanding (see Annex V) during the seventeenth round  of the talks, proposing to confine the three questions of voting  age, voting methods and the removal of restrictions on Hong Kong  deputies to Chinese people's congresses to the elections of the  district boards and municipal councils and to leave all  questions related to the Legislative Council elections to a  later stage. This new proposal aimed at seeking a solution was  rejected by the British side out of hand.    2. The British side alleged that the legislation on the  voting method for Legislative Council elections needed to be  passed as early as possible; otherwise, there would have to be  two separate legislations on the question of voting methods,  which would be a waste of time. In the view of the Chinese  side, to have two separate legislations was only a technical  question. There was no natural link between the voting methods  for the district board and municipal council elections and those  for the Legislative Council elections, not to mention there had  been separate legislations on these two sets of elections.  Since Legislative Council elections would not be held until  September 1995, there was not much time pressure. It was not  necessary to drag the question of the voting methods for  Legislative Council elections into the understanding on the  district board and municipal council elections now. It was  entirely possible and proper to leave this matter to the later  discussions between the two sides on Legislative Council  elections. Otherwise, it would only complicate the talks. While  saying that there was not much time left for the district board  and municipal council elections, the British side insisted on  dragging the issue of the voting methods for Legislative Council  elections into present discussions, which could well be settled  at a later stage. By so doing, it was placing obstacles to the  talks and trying to delay them. The Chinese side found it  difficult to understand.    3. The British side alleged that a motion on using the  "single seat, single vote" system in the 1995 Legislative  Council elections had been adopted by the Legislative Council  and that leaders of the two main parties in the current  Legislative Council all supported this method. The Chinese had  always regarded the Hong Kong Legislative Council as Hong Kong  governor's advisory body in legislative matters. If the British  side insisted on following the views of the Legislative Council  in the talks between the two governments, it would be totally  unacceptable to the Chinese side. As far as the Chinese side was  concerned, this was a matter of political principle.   <H5>    The British Side Deliberately Scuttled the Talks </H5>   As the British side had insisted that it be written into the  memorandum of understanding on district organization election  arrangements that the "single-seat, single-vote" voting method  be applied also to the Legislative Council's geographical  elections in 1995, the Chinese side, at the beginning of the  16th round of the talks, refuted this unreasonable British  demand as an artificial complication. But the British side made  counter-charges that the Chinese side had retrogressed from its  previous position on the question of appointed membership. In  response, the Chinese side reiterated its position enunciated  during the 15th round and pointed out that there was no  retrogression at all of the Chinese position. It suggested in  unequivocal terms that should the British side go along, the two  sides could reach agreement. Evidently, the British accusations  of Chinese retrogression of position were merely aimed at  misleading the public and absolving itself from the  responsibility for its reluctance to reach agreement with the  Chinese side.    In fact, it was the British side that had retrogressed.  Take for example the elections for the district boards and the  municipal councils. The British side gave approval to the  Chinese proposal for a settlement of the question of appointed  seats after the 15th round, accepting almost all the wording  proposed by the Chinese side. At the 17th round, the wording of  the British proposal on the same question was on the whole  similar to the Chinese proposal. But later, the British side  unexpectedly questioned the legitimacy of the Chinese Government  in representing the unborn government of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region to discuss with the British side on  appointed membership of the district boards and municipal  councils. It went so far as to accuse the Chinese side of  causing an erosion of the autonomy promised to the Hong Kong  Special Administrative Region under the Joint Declaration and  the Basic Law. This was entirely unjustifiable. The first draft  of the five points of understanding proposed by the Chinese side  during the 15th round contained a sentence which read: "The  government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will  determine on its own the number of appointed seats of district  boards and municipal councils in accordance with the provisions  of Article 98 of Basic Law." The words "on its own" were later  taken out for the sake of terseness, without altering the  original meaning. By the time the talks broke down, the British  side stated repeatedly that failure to reach an understanding  with the Chinese side on district organization elections was due  to the Chinese refusal to have the voting method of the  Legislative Council included. But now, the British side  switched to listing the so-called Chinese refusal to totally  abolish the appointed seats as an important cause. Such  inconsistency could hardly justify the British position.    During the 17th round of talks, the Chinese side made one  more major effort and submitted to the British side the draft  text of the above-mentioned five points of understanding on  "complete separation" of the discussions on the election  arrangements for 1994 from those for 1995. However, this  constructive proposal of the Chinese side was promptly rejected  by the British side, which read out a so-called "carefully  thought-out" statement announcing that the British side was  unable to continue its discussions with the Chinese side on an  understanding of the first phase. Subsequently, the Chinese  side formally reminded the British side that as early as 7 April  1993 when the two sides agreed to hold talks, the Chinese side  stated that, should the British side submit the so-called  "constitutional bills" to the Legislative Council for  deliberation before the two sides reached agreement through  talks, that would mean the breakdown of the talks and the  Chinese side was not to be held responsible for it. The British  side turned a deaf ear to the Chinese warning. On 10 December,  the governor [of] Hong Kong published a draft legislation of the  first stage constitutional package and submitted it to the  Legislative Council on 15 December, thus scuttling Sino-British  talks on electoral arrangements in Hong Kong.   <H5>    Concluding Remarks </H5>   From the above-mentioned facts, one can see that the British  side had no sincerity in the talks on the 1994/95 electoral  arrangements in Hong Kong. Although it agreed at the first to  base the talks on the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the  principle of convergence with the Basic Law and the existing  agreements and understandings reached between China and Britain,  it refused to keep its words during the talks. It was this  trick of paying lip service played by the British side that  prevented the talks from moving on the right track. The British  side had attempted, at the very outset of the talks, to include  in the agenda the three items that fell within the scope of  China's sovereignty, thus setting obstacles to the talks. Soon  after the beginning of the talks, the British Hong Kong  authorities carried out electoral arrangements which ought to be  agreed upon by the two sides through consultations. Finally, it  concocted some excuses and left the negotiation table.  Furthermore, it submitted the first part of the "constitutional  package" to the Legislative Council, leading to the breakdown of  the talks. Now, the British side has not only refused to  withdraw the first part of the "constitutional package", but has  even gone further by announcing that it would submit its second  part to the Legislative Council as well. It is determined to  shut the door to negotiations once and for all. It is the  British side which shall bear full responsibility for the  rupture of the talks.    The Chinese proposals for the 1994/95 electoral  arrangements are based on the three principles guiding the Sino-  British talks. They are designed to facilitate a smooth  transition in Hong Kong and ensure its residents a happy and  peaceful life. They are conducive to the convergence with the  Basic Law and reflect the general wish of the people of Hong  Kong. However, the British side has made unjustifiable  accusations against China on these proposals, saying that the  Chinese proposals would make it difficult to "maintain the rule  of law" and could lead to "possible manipulation of elections".  In fact, it is the violation of the Basic Law that would cause  disruption of the rule of law and it is the British side that is  attempting to manipulate elections. The British side has  criticized the Chinese proposals concerning election by  functional constituencies, asserting that they may cause  "corruption and vote-rigging". These allegations are totally  untenable and also reflect their disrespect for the voters and  present members of the Legislative Council elected by functional  constituencies. The British proposal concerning the electoral  methods for the functional constituencies not only runs counter  to the original purposes of the functional constituencies, but  also fails to follow the principle of gradual development. The  British insistence on the elimination of the appointed seats in  the district boards and the two municipal councils is against  the wishes of the majority of the Hong Kong [HK] people. On the  issue of "through train" or confirmation of the Legislative  Council members, the British side has tried to deprive the  Preparatory Committee for the HK SAR of its actual confirmation  right. It has up to now refused to acknowledge the agreements  and understandings reached between the two foreign ministers on  the question of the election committee.    All this fully reveals that the true intention of the  "constitutional package" the British side clings to, taking  advantage of the remaining years of the British rule in Hong  Kong and waving the banner of "democracy", it tries to create  division and confusion, place obstacles to a smooth transition  in Hong Kong and turn the last elections of the three-tier  structure to be held before 1997 in Britain's favour so as to  maintain its influence over Hong Kong for as long as possible  after 1997 and to manipulate the political situation there.    The core of the controversy between China and Britain over  the political structure in Hong Kong is not whether democracy  should be promoted or whether there should be "openness and  fairness" as claimed by the British side, but rather whether  international commitments should be honoured, whether there  should be convergence with the Basic Law, and whether a smooth  transition in Hong Kong should be achieved. The whole  controversy was started by a shift of Britain's Hong Kong  policy. Facts will prove that this policy shift will not serve  the British interests and will hurt Hong Kong as well.    The Sino-British talks have broken down as a result of the  British disruption. The Chinese side deems it necessary to  reiterate in all seriousness that in accordance with the  provisions of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the British  administration of Hong Kong shall come to an end on 30 June 1997  and the Chinese Government shall resume the exercise of its  sovereignty over Hong Kong as of 1 July 1997. The last district  boards, the two municipal councils and the Legislative Council  which form part of the political structure of Hong Kong under  the British administration, will stop functioning along with the  conclusion of the period of the British administration. The  political structure of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region after 1 July 1997 will be built in accordance with the  relevant decisions of the NPC of the People's Republic of China  and the provisions of the Basic Law.    Hong Kong will soon return to the embrace of its motherland.  Nobody can stop it. The Chinese Government and people are  confident and capable of resuming the exercise of sovereignty  over Hong Kong as scheduled, implementing the policy of "one  country, two systems" and the Basic Law and ensuring long-term  prosperity and stability in Hong Kong.    Annex I   <H5>    Chinese Draft of Points To Be Confirmed by the Two Sides </H5>   In late April 1993, the representative of the Chinese  Government, Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu, and the  representative of the British Government, Ambassador Robin  McLaren, in accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration,  the principle of convergence with the Basic Law and the relevant  agreements and understandings reached between the two sides,  held two rounds of talks on Hong Kong's 1994/95 electoral  arrangements.    1. The two sides reaffirm that pursuant to the consensus  reached between them, the Joint Declaration, the principle of  convergence with the Basic Law and the relevant agreements and  understandings reached between the two sides should serve as the  basis for their talks.    2. Both sides confirm that, before 1997, Hong Kong's  political structure should develop gradually on the basis of the  Joint Declaration and the reality in Hong Kong and should  converge with the Basic Law.    3. Both sides confirm that before 1997 the "executive-led"  political structure should be maintained in Hong Kong so as to  converge with the Basic Law.    4. As the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong bear on the smooth  transition to 1997, the Chinese and British sides shall conduct  serious consultations with a view to reaching consensus.    5. Both sides confirm that before 1997, the nature of Hong  Kong's district boards and two municipal councils as not being  political organs and their functions shall remain unchanged, so  shall the method of their formation.    6.

The ultimate aim is  the election of all the members of the Legislative Council by  universal suffrage.    The specific method for forming the Legislative Council and  its procedures for voting on bills and motions are prescribed in  Annex II: "Method for the formation of the Legislative Council  of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and its voting  procedures."   <H5>    (2) Paragraph 3 of Annex II of the Basic Law of Hong Kong </H5>  <H3>    Method for the Formation of the Legislative Council of  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Its Voting  Procedures </H3>    III.

Annex III   <H3>    Decision of the National People's Congress on the Method  for the Formation of the First Government and the First  Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special administrative  Region </H3>   Adopted by the Seventh National People's Congress at its  Third Session on 4 April 1990    1.

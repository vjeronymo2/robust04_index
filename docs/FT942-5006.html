			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Revive the OAU South Africa's admission to the Organisation of African Unity at the weekend will provide an opportunity to breathe new life into a discredited body. Since its inception in 1963 the OAU has been preoccupied by apartheid, but its contribution to the ending of minority rule was negligible. Instead South Africa became a convenient rallying point for leaders wishing to divert attention from their failures at home. OAU summits rightly denounced minority rule in South Africa, but ignored human rights abuses in member states. The organisation has also neglected its role as a mediator in African conflicts. It belatedly recognised the continent's economic crisis, but still seems reluctant to endorse the fundamentals of structural adjustment. Some of the more forthright leaders, such as Uganda's Yoweri Museveni, have made refreshingly frank appraisals of the OAU's performance. But only President Nelson Mandela can bring the combination of qualities that the OAU needs if it to be rejuvenated: moral authority, economic clout, military muscle and, above all, the inspiration of South Africa's successful transition to democracy. If one looks elsewhere for a figure with the right to speak for the region, one searches in vain. The first generation of post-independence African leaders are mostly dead and/or discredited. Many of their successors are even less fitted to the task. They pay lip service to democracy, line their pockets, and allow economic reform programmes to lapse. When he addresses the summit next week, Mr Mandela should set out the OAU's post-apartheid agenda. It can strengthen its commitment to democracy by encouraging and monitoring all members' elections. It should make mediation a priority, and co-ordinate its peacekeeping role with the UN. It can tackle corruption with the help of Transparency International, the recently-founded campaign for a universal code of business conduct. It should invite rigorous conditionality in return for bold western initiatives to resolve the external debt burden. Above all, Mr Mandela needs to inspire and harness the same energy and commitment that helped Africa win independence and gave the OAU its raison d'etre.</p>

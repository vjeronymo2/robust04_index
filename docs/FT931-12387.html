			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: City Site portfolio falls 11% CITY SITE Estates, a property company, yesterday announced that its pre-tax losses had increased from Pounds 3.37m to Pounds 17.97m for the year ended September 1992, which it described as 'the most difficult year in the company's history'. The share price dropped from 24p to 13p. The value of its property portfolio fell by 11 per cent to Pounds 113.8m, particularly as a result of a decline in property values in London. Property write-downs of Pounds 15.3m, together with a Pounds 3.02m write-off of goodwill arising from the consolidation of Viking Property Group, led to an Pounds 18.3m exceptional item. Pre-tax profits before exceptional items stood at Pounds 353,000 compared with a Pounds 1.6m loss the previous year. The company is unable to pay preference dividends as a result of the effect of this loss on its distributable reserves. It will apply to the Courts to release the share premium account which will reduce the revenue reserve deficit to Pounds 4.25m. Losses per share worked through at 119p (23p). Basic net assets per share fell from 122p to 9p and fully diluted from 174p to 109p.</p>

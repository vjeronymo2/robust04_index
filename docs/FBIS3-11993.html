			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 28 Mar (DPA) -- Following his  election yesterday as OAS secretary general, Colombian President  Cesar Gaviria today returned to his usual activities, quashing a  "mini-crisis" in his cabinet with the appointment of Jose Elias  Melo, a lawyer, as his new labor minister.    Melo, 34, replaces Luis Fernando Ramirez, who resigned after  announcing that he had been chosen to run for vice president by  opposition Conservative Party presidential candidate Andres  Pastrana. The new minister, Banking Superintendency chief until  today, is a member of the Conservative Party, so Gaviria thus  maintains the political structure of his cabinet, in which  members of the ruling Liberal Party prevail.    The resignation of Ramirez, 35, is the only one that has  occurred in the wake of the intensive political campaign now  under way in Colombia for the upcoming 29 May presidential  elections. Insistent rumors in the press asserted that  Government (Interior) Minister Fabio Villegas would tender his  resignation in order to take an important post in the Liberal  Party's leadership, but this did not happen. Likewise, other  speculation held that Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin would also  resign and accept the nomination for vice president on  Pastrana's ticket. But this was ruled out by the foreign  minister herself, who might be running for president in 1998.</p>

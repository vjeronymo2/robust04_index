			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TROJANS SEND MESSAGE BY REINSTATING PLAYERS  </P> <P> The news of the assault on a woman graduate student at USC was indeed shocking  to me.  </P> <P> However, I was outraged when I read that the students (allegedly) involved  continue to practice with the football team.  </P> <P> I am well aware that the legal aspects of this case have yet to be resolved. It  seems to me that the issue here is not one of legality but of morality.  </P> <P> The message sent by allowing these students continued participation in the USC  athletic program is clear: violence and sexual abuse of women is permitted at  USC.  </P> <P> SISTER JO ANN DeQUATTRO  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

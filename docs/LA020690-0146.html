			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MAORI RIGHTS CAMPAIGNERS HECKLE QUEEN  </P> <P> A young woman threw a T-shirt at Queen Elizabeth II today and radicals  campaigning for Maori rights heckled the British monarch during anniversary  celebrations for the founding of modern New Zealand.  </P> <P> The queen, who was accompanied by her husband, Prince Philip, appeared shaken,  witnesses said.  </P> <P> The woman, a member of New Zealand's Maori minority, threw a black T-shirt  after the queen disembarked from the royal barge that carried her to Waitangi,  a village in the country's far north.  </P> <P> Angry spectators seized the woman, aged about 17, dragged her from the crowd  and handed her over to police.  </P> <P> As the queen gave a speech marking the 150th anniversary of the Treaty of  Waitangi, a pact between Maoris and British colonial authorities, a small group  of radicals shouted "You already have everything! What more do you want,  Elizabeth?" and "150 years of oppression!"  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 27 (CNA) -- The Taiwan economy is  facing a host of potential threats, including both economic and  non-economic factors, ranking officials said Friday [27 May].    First of all, domestic investment, particularly in the  manufacturing sector, remains sluggish.    Vice Economic Affairs Minister Li Shu-jeou said the number  of  newly established factories declined in the first quarter of  this year and their aggregate paid-in capital also dropped as  compared with the year-earlier. Machinery imports, an effective  measure of investment activities, registered a 6 percent  decrease during the January-March period.    Li said difficulties in land acquisition remain the greatest  obstacle to private investment here. According to a recent  survey by the US-based McKinsey consulting firm, Taiwan's  industrial land prices are the second highest in Asia, behind  only Hong Kong.    Li added labor shortages, inadequate government incentives  and a growing "anti-commerce complex" have also discouraged  manufacturers from making new investments at home. He cited a  recent proposal by a township chief to levy "community  development taxes" on the construction sector and the forced  closure of the Makro Shopping Center in the Kaohsiung Industrial  Zone as examples of the so-called "anti-commerce complex."    Wang Chao-ming, a minister without portfolio, said he is  worried about possible power shortages because of the long delay  in construction of Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant and  growing labor-management conflicts over work hours and insurance  issues.    "If these problems cannot be resolved properly, our  industrial production and overall economic growth will be  adversely affected," Wang noted.    Kuo Wan-jung, also a minister without portfolio, said  Taiwan's foreign trade has become even more unbalanced, with its  reliance on the Mainland Chinese market increasing.    Taiwan's foreign trade surplus declined by nearly 70 percent  in the first four months of this year compared to 1993. Worse  yet, its trade deficit with Japan reached US$4.56 billion  between January and April. Taiwan also incurred a US$760  million trade deficit with Europe, while its trade surplus with  the United States shrank to US$893.9 million. Taiwan managed to  register a US$5.62 billion surplus in its trade with Hong Kong,  a major conduit for indirect Taiwan-Mainland China trade, during  the four-month period.    "All these figures point to changes in Taiwan's trade  picture, with its exports to advanced countries, such as the US,  Japan and European nations, declining while its reliance on the  mainland market is rising," noted Kuo.    She also called attention to potential inflationary  pressure,  saying the nearly 2 percent depreciation of the new Taiwan  dollar in recent months and rising oil and raw material prices  in the international market may destabilize local commodity  prices which would hinder economic growth.    However, Chairman Hsiao Wan-chang of the Council for  Economic  Planning and Development said he remains optimistic about  Taiwan's economic prospects. "Our economy is undergoing a  structural change, with technology-intensive industry playing an  increasingly important role," Hsiao noted.    Industrial production rose 6.2 percent in the January-April  period and heavy industry output grew an even more impressive 8  percent from the year-earlier level, he added.</p>

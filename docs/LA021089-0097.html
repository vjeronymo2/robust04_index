			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  AIDE PROMISED TO KEEP HUDSON SECRET  </P> <P> Rock Hudson's secretary did not tell the late actor's homosexual lover that  Hudson had AIDS because of a promise he made to Hudson, a lawyer told a jury in  Los Angeles on Thursday.  </P> <P> The Superior Court jury and four alternates must decide if Hudson and his  secretary and friend, Mark Miller, conspired to keep Hudson's illness secret  from his lover, Marc Christian, so they could continue having sex.  </P> <P> Christian's lawyer contends that Miller kept Hudson's diagnosis secret because,  in part, he did not want to risk losing any money he was to get from the estate  when Hudson died.  </P> <P> Andrew Banks, Miller's lawyer, said in his closing argument that Miller had  been Hudson's friend for more than 30 years, his secretary for 13 years, and  that Hudson had asked him not to tell Christian he had AIDS after learning in  June, 1984, of the diagnosis. Miller did not know the details of Hudson's will,  Banks said.  </P></p>

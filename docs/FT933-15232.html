			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: AEG strengthens Electrolux link AEG's domestic appliances division is to extend its co-operation with Electrolux, the Swedish multinational with which it recently swapped minority share stakes. Decisions on co-operation in other product areas, apart from an existing link in laundry appliances and dishwashers, could be expected in the autumn, the Daimler-Benz subsidiary said yesterday. Meanwhile, cost-cutting measures were continuing in the light of an expected marked weakening in deliveries this year, Mr Carlhanns Damm, AEG chairman said yesterday. The workforce was being reduced by more than 500 to 8,500. Export markets were especially weak, he said, and a 1 per cent increase in sales by the German parent in the first half was due to domestic demand. Profits would be hit by lower exports and exchange rate losses, Mr Damm added. The slowdown followed a successful year in which turnover had been aided by strong demand from eastern Germany, and improvements in the group's costs structure, including the loss of 500 employees, had lifted net earnings to DM60m (Dollars 37.5m) from DM28m in 1991. Sales rose to DM2.33bn from DM2.22bn. AEG and Electrolux were satisfied with the results of their first six months' co-operation, Mr Damm said. Under the present deal, the companies manufacture washing machines jointly, and AEG supplies Electrolux with clothes dryers and dishwashers.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department does not believe reporting mechanical delays and mechanical cancellations would cause an employee to compromise safety to improve an airline's on-time performance. Under the present system, an employee could easily improve its employer's on-time performance by miscategorizing a delayed flight as a mechanical delay. The IG's report did not find a pattern of this type of behavior at any of the reporting carriers. Rather, some flights were reported as delayed flights that should have been excluded as mechanical delays, while other flights that were called mechanical delays were actually delayed for other reasons. In no case was a carrier's monthly on-time performance ranking affected by misclassification of flights. Given the fact employees did not attempt to improve on-time performance by intentionally misclassifying flights, the Department does not believe employees will violate FAA regulations, risk their own jobs, and threaten passenger safety by dispatching unairworthy aircraft to improve on-time performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, the Department believes the elimination of the exclusion for mechanical delays and mechanical cancellations will provide better consumer information since aircraft dispatch reliability will now be a factor in a carrier's on-time performance. For example, two carriers each ground one of their aircraft for a day because of mechanical problems. Carrier A fulfills its schedule using a backup aircraft. All of Carrier A's flights are on-time except for the last flight operated with the backup aircraft. Carrier B does not have a backup aircraft available, so it cancels eight flights that were to be operated with the disabled aircraft. Carrier B fulfills the rest of its schedule in a timely manner. Under the mechanical exclusion provision, Carrier B would have the better on-time flight performance for that day even though it was without a backup aircraft and cancelled eight flights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The present system, in some circumstances, penalizes the carrier with the more reliable service. Elimination of the mechanical exclusion would end this inequity. If the previous example were based on the new rule, the carrier meeting its schedule with backup equipment would have the better on-time rating. The availability of this additional information would result in a more accurate portrayal of a carrier's flight operation, thereby enabling the consumer to make a more informed flight-selection decision. Furthermore, the elimination of the exclusion should benefit the on-time rankings of carriers with more effective preventive maintenance programs because such carriers would experience fewer mechanical delays and mechanical cancellations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department intends for the airlines to continue to put safety first, and to train their employees accordingly. As Northwest stated, it too always places safety ahead of on-time performance and instructs its employees to do the same when there is a conflict between timeliness and safety. The Department is confident all carriers operate in the same manner as Northwest. The change in the reporting requirements in 14 CFR Part 234 does not affect the requirement under 14 CFR &sect;&sect;121.703 and 121.705 that carriers report equipment malfunctions to the FAA. It is important to remember the Department is not establishing a required level of performance that each carrier must meet. Rather, the Department merely discloses to the public the carriers' on-time performance by month. The public will be better informed when each carrier reports its complete schedule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATA, American and Delta filed in support of the proposed amendment. They contend the elimination of the exclusion would not compromise safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATA does not believe the elimination of the exclusion will adversely affect reporting air carriers or the travelling public. The inclusion of mechanical-delay and mechanical-cancellation information will give those interested in air carrier flight performance a better picture of flight delay and cancellation activity. The safety of passengers and crew is the most important responsibility of air carriers. ATA states that carriers devote enormous resources and attention to fulfilling that responsibility. ATA does not believe the elimination of the mechanical-delay and mechanical-cancellation exclusion will induce ATA members to dispatch aircraft that are unairworthy, or have any other adverse effect upon aviation safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> American believes that carriers would not risk safety for competitive reasons. Reporting all flights would ``provide consumers with a more accurate picture of a carrier's overall on-time record, which is the reason for the rule in the first place.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Delta states that it has incurred considerable unnecessary expense to exclude the mechanical delays and mechanical cancellations, and argues that their inclusion will not have a negative effect on the safety of airline operations. Moreover, the existing rule ``has the effect of punishing carriers with better dispatch reliability records relative to their competitors.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

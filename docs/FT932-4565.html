			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / World News in Brief: FT weather forecast From today, the Financial Times is expanding its weather coverage to include maps and extended forecasts tailored to its individual editions serving the UK, Europe, the US and Asia. The list of capital cities and business centres now gives the maximum temperatures expected on the day of publication, replacing the list of noon temperatures the previous day. Thick black lines on the maps denote weather fronts. Those with triangles are cold fronts, those with blobs are warm and those with both symbols indicate where the two are combined. The new service is compiled by Meteo Consult of the Netherlands. Weather, Page 22</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / People: Tiphook passes extra load to Hambro Rupert Hambro, 50, managing director of the J O Hambro merchant banking boutique, is to take a bigger role in the affairs of Tiphook, the troubled container leasing group. Hambro has been a non-executive director since September 1990 and the annual report, coming out later this month, is expected to reveal he is stepping up to be one of the company's two deputy chairmen. Tiphook, which was founded in 1978 by its executive chairman Robert Montague, has grown into the world's second biggest container leasing company. However, there has been growing concern about its accounting policies and the high salaries it has paid some of its executives. City concerns came to a head last month when the company reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 21.8m, much worse than early expectations. The appointment of Hambro, who is a non-executive director of several companies ranging from Anglo-American Corporation to the Daily Telegraph, is part of an effort to restore Tiphook's credibility. Tiphook already has one a deputy chairman, Eric Goodwin, and it is understood that he will remain an executive deputy chairman whereas Hambro will be a non-executive. Hambro's promotion means that he will be the senior non-executive figure on a board which includes Kenneth Dick, a former executive chairman of Mitchell Cotts, who is over 80. Although investors will welcome Hambro's decision to play a bigger role in Tiphook's affairs, there was some concern at the continuing unconventional way in which information about Tiphook seems to emerge through leaks to the press. Many UK fund managers have sold their shares to US investors and given the size of the US interest in the firm, one analyst ventured that it might have been better to bring an American onto the board.</p>

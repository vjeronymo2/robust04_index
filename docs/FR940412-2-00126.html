			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Part III_Special Requirements, Review/Award Criteria and Contacts for Additional Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Evaluation Plan: This CPCD Program requires more rigor in the conceptualization, design and implementation of projects and in their evaluation than the previous Community Partnership Program. The goal is to achieve and document measurable reductions in alcohol, tobacco and other drug abuse incidence, prevalence, and related consequences such as alcohol and other drug related health problems, violence, deaths, and injuries among all age and ethnic groups within a community or regional area. Applications submitted under this announcement must present a multi-year comprehensive substance abuse prevention plan for systems change at the community or geographic area level through the design and implementation of one of the two approaches discussed in the Program Model section of this announcement. The application must contain an evaluation plan which will enable the grantee to assess the effect of the prevention program on a variety of indicators, as described in the remainder of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ultimate goal of this program is to demonstrate significant reductions in substance abuse. The broad outcomes expected include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. A measurable and sustained reduction in initiation of alcohol, tobacco and other drug use among children and adolescents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. A reduction in alcohol, tobacco and other drug related deaths and injuries especially among children, adolescents and young adults. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. A decline in the prevalence of health problems related to and exacerbated by alcohol, tobacco and other drug use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. A reduction in on the job problems and injuries related to substance abuse. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. A reduction in substance abuse related crime. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CSAP will support only applicant projects that have a well developed and comprehensive evaluation plan. The evaluation plan must be conceptually and procedurally integrated with the overall project, and must have both an outcome evaluation component and a process evaluation component. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the purpose for this program is to reduce the incidence and prevalence of substance abuse and related health and safety problems in the targeted area, instruments should be used which will provide periodic measures of these indicators. In addition to measures of incidence and prevalence related to substance abuse and related health and safety problems, grantees will be required to collect data on the seven (7) items listed in the Community Wide Indicators of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse included in the Application Kit. Applicants must specify the means to be used to collect these data. Grantees will be required to collect baseline data, yearly progress report data, and end of project data, and may be required to collect follow-up data on all indices. Grantees will be required to submit all reports and results in both hard copy and in electronic media formats. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The evaluation plan must present a sound methodology for the collection, storage, analysis, and interpretation of data. The evaluation plan must utilize psychometrically sound measures and instruments for data collection. Applicants must describe the selection of instruments to be used and must provide information about their normative properties, including the appropriateness of their use for the culture(s) under study. The presented evaluation methods, measures and instruments must be sensitive and relevant to the target groups of the community with respect to age and gender distribution, reading level, and culture. The evaluation plan must also present a time-line for carrying out all evaluation procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The evaluation plan must be designed and carried out by a professional who is highly experienced in comparative evaluation methodology, independent of the project, and able to work closely with the grantee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

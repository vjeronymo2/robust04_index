			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME BUILDING RULES TO CHANGE  </P> <P> The City Council, dominated by three new members sympathetic to development, on  Monday rejected a proposal to block construction of oversized homes and  signaled it would favor a less stringent measure.  </P> <P> Three new council members who voted to reject the so-called "mansionization"  ordinance -- Fred Balderrama, Samuel Kiang, and Marie T. Purvis -- said it was  too restrictive and unfairly punished property owners trying to build  decent-sized homes.  </P> <P> They said, however, they are willing to pass a scaled-down version of the law  that would restrict the floor area of houses only in projects of four houses or  fewer.  </P> <P> The new version waives floor area requirements for large, new projects --  including the controversial Monterey Views development. During the past few  months, council members have clashed over application of the proposed law to  Monterey Views, 86 single-family homes proposed to be built on the city's  largest chunk of vacant land.  </P> <P> "People have a right to build on their property," Purvis said before asking  City Atty. Anthony Canzoneri to scale down the ordinance. The action, hailed by  developers who attended the council meeting, marks a departure from previous  years, when councils controlled by slow-growth activists took drastic measures  to curb development in the city -- including building moratoriums and stricter  rules governing commercial areas.  </P> <P> Mayor Judy Chu and Councilwoman Betty Couch voted in favor of the original  ordinance Monday. After it failed to pass, however, they agreed to support the  more lenient version.  </P> <P> Couch -- a slow-growth advocate who has voted in the minority on development  issues since the new council took office in April -- said Monterey Park no  longer is on the cutting edge of controlling development in the San Gabriel  Valley. Other cities -- including Alhambra, Arcadia and San Gabriel -- already  have strict laws to curb construction of bulky, oversized homes.  </P> <P> "We were a leader before, and other cities followed," Couch said. "It's not  that way anymore. Now (the new council members) want to make everybody happy."  </P> <P> The revised ordinance, to be considered at the council's next meeting on Dec.  10, would:  </P> <P> * Limit the amount of ground a house can cover. Houses on lots of less than  6,000 square feet can cover 50% of the lot; houses on lots between 6,000 and  10,000 square feet can cover 40% of the lot or 3,000 square feet, whichever is  greater; houses on lots greater than 10,000 square feet can only cover 35% of  the lot or 4,000 square feet, whichever is greater  </P> <P> * Require three-car garages for all new houses of more than 3,000 square feet.  </P> <P> * Ban external staircases to cut down on illegal rental units in single family  homes.  </P> <P> The original ordinance, which was rejected Monday, would have applied to all  new construction. It also would have tightened city rules requiring that new  construction not encroach on front lawns.  </P> <P> Under the proposed revision, there would be no added front lawn requirements.  The parking requirements and outside staircase ban would apply to all new  construction.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, several residents said any restrictions on large homes are unfair.  </P> <P> "You call them monster homes," David Pedroza said. "Really, all they are is  big, beautiful homes. What are we? Jealous because someone's building a  beautiful home in our neighborhood?"  </P></p>

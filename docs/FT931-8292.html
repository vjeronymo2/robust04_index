			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (1): Challenge of the notebooks - The computer industry today bears little resemblance to its counterpart of a decade ago. Younger, more agile competitors are moving in the direction of more compact, more flexible and more portable personal computers INSURANCE ASSESSORS inspecting the damage caused by Hurricane Andrew in the southern states of the US last year took part in a novel experiment. They used a hand-held computer which was able to accept handwriting and also to determine its geographic location by reference to a satellite signal - an essential capability with roads and streets damaged or vanished. A linked video camera provided a complete photographic image of the devastation. The experiment points to the future use of portable computing - and to the way the computer industry is going. Today's computer industry bears little resemblance to its counterpart of a decade ago and rapid change is still the order of the day. Personal computers and their more powerful cousins, workstations, are the key contributors to the shift which has seen yesterday's industry leaders cast down in favour of younger, more agile competitors, and a decisive swing away from traditional mainframe-based data processing. The leaders of the new industry include Microsoft, the software company which sells, MS/DOS, the most popular operating system, Intel, the semiconductor house which makes the microprocessors used by the majority of PCs, and Novell, which markets the most popular networking software. It has become a world where the owners of the key technologies have the whip hand. Computer makers are, in a sense, simply distributors of that technology. For the future, therefore, there is a powerful incentive for companies to establish their proprietary technology as an industry standard. Digital Equipment, for example, a company which missed out on the personal computer revolution the first time round, is trying to establish its Alpha microprocessor, the first commercial 64-bit risc chip, as a standard for power computing. It faces competition from IBM, Hewlett Packard, Sun Microsystems and MIPS. IBM is still the world leader in personal computer sales, with revenues from its PC business of between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 12bn a year. The European leader is Olivetti of Italy, while NEC has a commanding lead in Japan by virtue of its proprietary design. Now the personal computer industry is beginning to experience, in its turn, the wind of change as portable computers in a broad range of sizes and designs begin both to make inroads into the desk-top market, and to make personal computing available to a new generation of potential customers. About 20 per cent of all personal computers bought today are portable, and the proportion is increasing. Consultants Frost &amp; Sullivan estimate total shipments of portable computers in the US last year at 2.3m units, 2.14 of which were notebook machines. There is little disadvantage now for the individual in opting for a portable computer over a traditional desktop. Portable and notebook computers use the same powerful microprocessors, run the same software and have as much memory as desktop machines. Lightweight power supplies seem likely to remain out of reach, for the foreseeable future, however. There is a wide choice of laptops. Olivetti has introduced the Quaderno, smaller and lighter than conventional laptops with digital audio recording. Handheld computers include devices from Hewlett Packard of the US and Psion of the UK. The development of portable computing is being driven by advances in miniaturisation which often boggle belief. IBM has developed at its Boca Raton, Florida, laboratories, for example, a 105 megabyte hard disk drive about the size of a credit card destined for a new generation of very small personal computers. A decade ago, a 10 megabyte drive in a 20-pound 'luggable' computer was at the leading edge. IBM researchers envisage a range of tiny, personal machines which can be modified for different purposes by plugging in adaptor cards - a global positioning device to work with an on-screen map, for example, or a colour video camera. Mr Jack Kuehler, IBM's most senior technologist, describes the strategy as akin to 'razor and razor blades'. The personal computer is the razor. The core business will be providing the 'blades' of on-line services, communications and information. IBM is not alone in anticipating huge potential demand for products of this kind. Apple Computer has in development a personal digital assistant, called Newton, which is due to be launched this year. Newton will combine computing power with the facility of an electronic organiser. It will accept handwritten input and fit in a suit pocket. EO, a Californian company, has forged an alliance with AT&amp;T, and the Japanese company Matsushita, to develop a personal communicator combining personal telephone and personal computer. These gadgets, exciting though they are for the future, form the second age of PCs. The personal computer industry is today characterised by more immediate concerns, including pricing, branding and distribution. Companies across the world are no longer spending money on computing as they did in the past. Total investment in computer systems - mainframes to notebooks - was Dollars 107bn in 1992, Dollars 2.5bn less than in the previous year according to the US consultancy Dataquest. These numbers reflect the effects of the recession, the falling cost of computer hardware and a tougher attitude to IT investment among senior executives. Nevertheless, according to Dataquest, European PC suppliers experienced a surge in demand in the second half of 1992. According to Mr Chris Fell, director of Dataquest's PC service, the surge represents a blip in spending as the market takes advantage of the price wars. 'Shipments will certainly remain strong into the early part of 1993, as manufacturers struggle to fulfil a backlog of orders. We will have to see if the demand continues through the summer, although we feel a return to more modest growth is inevitable later in the year.' The price of personal computers has already fallen by up to 40 per cent a year over the past few years - a basic PC which cost more than Pounds 4,500 in 1983 now costs Pounds 500. There are indications that prices could fall a further 20 per cent this year causing problems for manufacturers and distributors alike as slim profit margins are squeezed further. It seems likely, however, that prices are stabilising and that PCs will become richer in features rather than cheaper. There are now comparatively few PC components on which prices can fall further. An exception is active matrix flat colour screens, manufactured principally in Japan and used for top-of-the-range portable and laptop machines. The percentage of useable screens obtained from the manufacturing process is still disappointingly low. When it improves, prices will fall rapidly. Many trace the latest phase in the PC price war to June 15 last year when Compaq, a US company which had been a world leader in high performance PCs, announced a plethora of new products along with price cuts of up to 32 per cent. New ranges of low-priced models were announced. The effect was electric. 1992 was the year of the no-name manufacturer, when companies without much track record gained market share at the expense of the well-known names, selling on price and a realisation among customers that a well-known brand name was no guarantee of extra quality. Examples of no-name clone makers include Elonex in the UK and Vobis in Germany. The effect of Compaq's announcement was to cut the difference in price between a Compaq computer and a no-name clone to only 15 per cent from 35 per cent. Last month the company reported net income for the three months to December 31 of Dollars 89.5m, or Dollars 1.10 a share, on sales of Dollars 1.42bn, against net earnings of Dollars 66.6m, or 77 cents, on sales of Dollars 873.4m a year earlier. Analysts had expected the company to earn between 80 cents and Dollars 1.01 share in the quarter. Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, chief executive, was quoted as saying: 'We have seen record-setting demand for our entire product line since June when we began implementing our new strategy of offering price-leading products that feature Compaq quality and the best service and support in the industry.' Later in the year, IBM announced its own strategy: four separate product sectors, each serviced separately. A new, wholly-owned subsidiary was established in Europe to compete, apparently successfully, with the lowest cost no-name suppliers without hurting IBM's quality image. It also introduced a budget line world-wide - the PS/Valuepoint systems designed to compete against lower priced offerings from Compaq, Dell and the like. These lower priced machines have been selling well. The turnround at Compaq and IBM suggests that if prices are comparable, customers will opt for the name brand. Prepare for further blood-letting this year. By comparison, Hurricane Andrew was a breeze.</p>

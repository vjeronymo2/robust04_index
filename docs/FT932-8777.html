			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Bank governor to accept salary freeze for five years MR EDDIE GEORGE, the new governor of the Bank of England and a man wedded to low inflation, has agreed to freeze his salary of more than Pounds 200,000 for his five-year period of office. The Bank said yesterday that it knew of no one else in Britain who had shown similar restraint over pay. 'We hope Mr George will start a new trend,' it said. Mr George, the present deputy governor who takes over the top job on July 1, is known within Threadneedle Street as 'the last Stalinist' because of his tough, autocratic management style. He is convinced Britain must curb price and wage pressures if it is to create a sound economy in the 1990s, a message to be rammed home today in the Bank's new quarterly report on inflation. The five-year freeze indicates that Mr George is anxious to avoid a repeat of the row two years ago when news emerged of a 17 per cent pay rise agreed by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the current governor. At that time, he was urging low wage increases as part of the battle against inflation. Mr George, who has been at the Bank for 31 years, is thought to have agreed on a salary of between Pounds 200,000 and Pounds 220,000 from the start of his time in office. The salary - the same as the amount paid to Mr Leigh-Pemberton last year - is considerably more than that earned by other public servants, but well below the pay of many top names in the City. Mr George, aged 54, earned Pounds 164,910 in the year to February last year. The Bank refuses to say how much Mr George is earning. He is reputed, however, to have turned down in recent years a number of Pounds 1m annual-salary jobs from big financial services companies. The news about Mr George failed to impress the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union, which called yesterday for the Bank to open pay talks for its 4,500 members there. It also rejected the government's public-sector pay norm of 1.5 per cent. Mr Jim Lowe, the union's assistant secretary for the Bank, said staff deserved 'a decent pay rise' as much as the governor. 'A pay freeze is easier to bear when your salary is over Pounds 200,000,' said Mr Lowe. He said Bank of England staff had not achieved the scale of increases received in recent years by the present governor. In the year to February 1992, Mr Leigh-Pemberton, who is retiring after 10 years as governor, earned Pounds 164,311. He waived a further Pounds 34,135. In the previous year he was paid Pounds 155,019 and in the 12 months to February 1990 he earned Pounds 132,558. RBS chief criticised Page 6 Editorial Comment Page 17</p>

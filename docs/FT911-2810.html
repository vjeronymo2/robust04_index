			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Wine: The wine lake starts to overflow - Why severe frosts in Bordeaux are not too much cause for concern ANOTHER BIG vintage this year would have a disastrous effect on the Bordeaux trade, so last weekend's severe frost will have had a good short term effect. However, curtailed stocks for a year or so will not affect the current trend towards overproduction. AFTER three abundant vintages in France, concern is growing that there is too much wine and the yields are too high. There has always been too much vin de table in the Midi but now there is apprehension about some of the appellation controlee wines that account for 20-25 per cent of total French production. This applies particularly in Bordeaux, the biggest appellation controlee region, and in Burgundy, where world demand for white wines has encouraged over-production. AC wines are controlled from the vineyards upwards, with specified grapes, minimum alcoholic strengths and maximum yields per hectare. Apart from generic wines such as Bordeaux Rouge or Bourgogne Blanc, or large one-appellation districts such as Alsace or Muscadet, they tend to be based on communes rather than single estates. So, the appellations for Ch Latour and Montrachet are only Pauillac and Puligny, which can be pretty basic wines. The system began in 1935 with the foundation of the Institut National des appellations d'Origine (INAO) which has designated, defined and generally improved the quality of the wines under its control. Among the superior ACs, however, the authorised maximum yields increasingly were challenged; and as viticultural skills rose and the techniques of vinication developed rapidly, there was good reason to have more flexible regulations, according to the quality of each vintage. In 1974, the INAO introduced a new system giving each AC a basic maximum yield per ha (rendement de base). This can be varied up or down by the committee (syndicat) of the growers in each appellation, which meets shortly before the vintage and forwards its views for the INAO's approval. This is known as the rendement annuel. Not surprisingly, demands for reductions have been far fewer than for increases and the growers have, on the whole, got their way. Yet, on top of this the INAO allowed a further level of yield - a 'ceiling', generally of 20 per cent (plafond limite de classement) subject to tasting. But if wine fails at this maximum, the grower's whole crop can be declassified and sent for distillation or vinegar. Theoretically, this plafond limite de classement is allowed only 'in an exceptional year when quality and quantity conicides'. This concession was, however, launched in the prolific but distinctly poor vintage of 1974 - something that did not inspire confidence in the INAO's judgment. Now, ceilings are created practically everywhere every year. Not long ago, Pauillac obtained one of 70 hl per ha, a level at which quality can be affected only negatively. Then, in 1983, there was a nation-wide shake up of appellations and most of Bordeaux's 57 different varieties were substantially increased in yield: Bordeaux Rouge from 50 to 55 hl, Bordeaux Blanc from 50 to 65, Pauillac from 40 to 45. But St Emilion was unaltered at 45 and Pomerol moved up only from 40 to 42. With 1988, 1989 and now 1990 on the books, Bordeaux has a marketing problem. For 1989's record claret production has been followed by another record 4.9m hl of AC red wine. Although 200-250 chateaux have international reputations that provide them with important sales abroad, only about 10 per cent of these have no selling worries. Bernard Mallet, president of the growers' syndicate of the Cote de Bourg and proprietor of the respected Ch Haut-Macao, warned recently: 'With a global production of six million we are moving towards serious mishaps . . .We must keep down the production, being very strict on planting: no more new planting rights for five years, and restricted transfer of rights.' On the crucial matter of limiting yields, Mallet said the rendement de base of each appellation should be applied strictly. He also proposed restrictive conditions on individual applications for an increased percentage, such as limiting to 1 per cent the addition of wine by means of chaptalisation (sugaring of the must) instead of the 2 per cent allowed normally. These outspoken remarks reflect the views of many and they back up what Hubert Mussotte, the influential head of the Comite Interprofessionel's statistical department, wrote last June before that year's record harvest: 'The acknowledged fall in the sales of the red wines deserves particular attention. Is it the forerunner of a serious crisis, because of the imbalance created by the increase in vineyard area and crops faced by stagnation in consumption?' About 400,000 hl of last year's generic AC red Bordeaux has been blocked from sale in a reserve qualitative of those wines that exceeded a certain yield: in the case of Bordeaux Rouge, above 45 hl per ha; and 40 hl of Medoc and Graves. This is done to stabilise prices, and the wines will be released before this year's vintage, but it demonstrates the size of the local 'wine lake'. This is confirmed by Peter Sichel, chairman of the Union des Grands Crus, principal shareholder of Ch Palmer and owner of Ch d'Angludet, in his new annual Vintage and Market Report. No fewer than 393,000 hl of wine, nearly all red, were eliminated from the 1990 crop totals because they exceeded the ceiling of 61 hl, and were sent for distillation. Since the last vintage, trade has been very quiet in Bordeaux at all levels, and, apart from the normal sales of basic wines consumed quickly, there has been little forward interest in the undoubtedly excellent 1990 superior appellations. Exports have been poor in important but recession-hit markets like the UK and US, yet sales abroad are crucial to Bordeaux. In 1989 these approached 2m hl in volume and FFr 5bn in value. The UK was then (and could still be when the 1990 statistics come out) Bordeaux's biggest customer: sales of 320m hl, worth FFr 700m. Moreover, although US imports from Bordeaux have been falling fast since 1986, the average price paid per bottle is the highest in the world and it is the biggest buyer of classed-growth clarets. Now, with large unsold or unconsumed stocks in both countries, the recession and a low dollar-franc exchange rate, en primeur buyers of the 1990 clarets are hardly likely to be encouraged.</p>

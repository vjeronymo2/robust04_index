			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Management: Europe starts to face HIV issue European-based companies have been slower than their US counterparts in establishing policies to deal with employees who are HIV positive or have Aids, write Paul Abrahams in London, David Buchan in Paris and Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt. One of the main reasons is that the disease has spread more slowly in Europe than North America. In the UK, for example, 3,995 people have died of Aids since 1982. 'HIV and Aids is a new issue in Europe, and only a small number of employees have so far been involved,' said Glenys Rowe, an independent consultant on HIV and Aids implications for business. Companies that addressed the problem early have mostly been branches of US multinationals or UK-based groups with subsidiaries in Africa and Asia. Public services such as police, fire and ambulance brigades also have policies. However, Rowe says that large and even small and medium-sized groups are now beginning to look at the issue. She says it is important for companies to prepare in advance. Some companies, for example, have been placed in the difficult position of taking disciplinary action against an employee for absenteeism and then it being revealed during a hearing that he or she is HIV positive. About half of the companies that consider adopting a policy for HIV do not do so, but incorporate the issue into existing health policies. A special policy would lead to discrimination, they fear. An effective policy would prevent discrimination in recruitment and continued employment, and counter victimisation by work colleagues. Rowe says a catalogue exists of terrible cases of victimisation. Organisations must prepare through education programmes to counter misconceptions about how the disease is spread. One of the most encouraging signs, she believes, is the launch of the UK Corporate HIV &amp; Aids Project. This has linked the leading Aids charities with companies such as IBM UK, Unilever, Body Shop, Kingfisher, Wellcome and Marks &amp; Spencer. The project's aim is to produce a number of briefing sheets on a variety of policy issues when considering the impact of HIV and Aids on businesses. In France, companies still focus on preventing the spread of Aids, rather than organising for a future in which a sizeable proportion of the workforce may be HIV positive. But even on prevention, a degree of corporate complacency exists which is surprising given that ministerial responsibility for the infection of haemophiliacs with Aids-contaminated blood has been a big political issue in recent months. When the French Agency for the Fight against Aids recently surveyed more than 1,000 company personnel directors, they found that one in 10 firms had employees carrying the HIV virus. One in four companies had carried out prevention/information programmes. But the 80 per cent of companies which had not so far introduced any specific programme said they saw no reason to do so in the future. Yet two-thirds of those interviewed also said that for companies to relay information on Aids to their staff was appropriate. Companies with a relatively large number of white-collar employees tended to be more active on Aids information, while those in the building sector were most passive, not to say hostile, on the issue. In Germany, infection rates grow steadily, but Aids and the HIV virus remain issues of concern to sociologists and statisticians rather than managers - or employees. In the year to last September, federal authorities recorded 1,050 new Aids cases, taking the total to 8,760 among the 53,500 people registered as infected with the HIV virus. Exhaustive research in the years since 1986, when the government started a national 'Give Aids no chance' advertising campaign, has uncovered dwindling concern among the population. Evidence has tended to confirm popular convictions that the risks are minimal for heterosexuals who do not inject drugs, are not among the estimated 1.6m men who regularly visit a German brothel, and do not holiday in Thailand and other 'sex-tourist' hot-spots. According to the latest statistics, homosexual or bisexual men account for 65 per cent of new Aids diagnoses and drug addicts for 15 per cent. New diagnoses attributed to infection through heterosexual intercourse in the year to last September numbered fewer than 100. That the proportion of cases confirmed among this group has more than trebled in the past five years has gone almost unremarked.</p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Uruguay sound on trade, says Gatt URUGUAY's trade regime has gradually changed from a highly protected to a relatively liberal one. But the benefits are being reduced by high trade barriers in rich countries to Uruguay's farm and textile exports, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) says in a report yesterday It warns that Uruguay risks lagging behind the economic liberalisation of Brazil and Argentina, its giant neighbours and fellow members with Paraguay of the Mercosur common market. This could mean rapid and painful structural adjustment in Uruguay's import-competing industries when trade barriers are scrapped within Mercosur from January 1995. The Gatt council yesterday welcomed Uruguay's progress in liberalising trade and deregulating its domestic market, despite economic difficulties. The report notes that average tariffs have fallen from nearly 700 per cent in 1968 to 21.5 per cent by January 1992. The council urged Uruguay's trading partners to support the reform process by reducing obstacles to its exports. Entry barriers and subsidised exports under EC and US farm policies have particularly hit Uruguay's exports. Uruguay, which hosted the launch of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks in 1986, is a member of the Cairns Group pushing for cuts in farm subsidies.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Pashkov followed by editorial </F> commentary: "The Ministry of Railways Has Declared War on  Newspaper Readers. This Is the Purport of a Telegram Received in  Sverdlovsk Oblast"]    [Text] Yekaterinburg -- "In connection with numerous  instances which have come to light concerning the conveyance of  commercial freight in mail cars in most flagrant violation of  the transport regulations, particularly when a highly flammable  liquid is loaded into cars and the actual weight of the freight  is understated -- which poses a threat to the life and health of  passengers and train crews -- the Ministry of Railways orders  that as of 15 March this year, it is forbidden to couple all  mail cars to fast trains and passenger trains, except for local  ones."    If you consider that local trains are few and irregular  today  (once again on the initiative of the Ministry of Railways), it  follows from this that thousands of subscribers to IZVESTIYA and  other publications printed in Yekaterinburg will receive the  newspaper two or three days later in Perm or Tyumen. But even  in Sverdlovsk Oblast itself, which covers an area of thousands  of kilometers, any newspaper will now arrive much later, for  previously the whole system of newspaper delivery was geared not  to the convenience of railroad workers but to the speed of  delivery of the printed word. It is clear that nobody wants a  "stale" newspaper....    In the opinion of specialists, the reference to concern for  the health of passengers is clearly of a demagogic nature.  This, incidentally, can be seen from the telegram itself.  Everything here is simpler -- if a really commercial car is  coupled instead of a mail car which is used as a commercial car,  then the railroad will make a corresponding profit. It is clear  that if corruption exists in society, for example, then it is  necessary to combat corruption and not all of society.  <H5>  From the Editors </H5>   Together with the report from own correspondent Aleksandr  Pashkov we also received from Yekaterinburg a copy of the  Railways Ministry telegram signed by Deputy Minister Salatov.  It turns out that the ban on coupling mail cars to fast trains  and passenger trains extends not only to Sverdlovsk Oblast but  also to the entire area of the former USSR, including the Baltic  countries!    In order to understand what kind of a blow this is to  readers  of daily newspapers, let us report that IZVESTIYA, for example,  is printed in 27 CIS cities, to which newspaper pages are sent  by phototelegraph, are duplicated in regional printing plants,  and are then sent on to other cities and villages -- frequently  precisely by rail transport. If a newspaper is held up for  two-five days on its way to the subscribers, this renders the  journalists' work pointless. Reporters sometimes risk their  lives to be the first to report events; every day, on the eve of  signing an issue to press, the production group calculates the  production schedule minute by minute -- all so that the finished  product, in accordance with the will of the railroad chiefs, can  be turned into unwanted bundles of waste paper!    Alas, this is not the first time in recent years that  newspapers, particularly daily ones, have fallen victim to the  petty tyranny of officials. The press is not even mentioned in  Mr. Salatov's order. But must the press and its millions of  readers pay for the fact that mail car guards convey "freight  which does not correspond to the carriage documents, including  flammable and dangerously explosive freight"? Why are  newspapers, which already pay the railroads punctually for  delivering their goods, obliged to pay for the Railways  Ministry's internal departmental innovations?    If such a thing had happened some 10 years ago, the very  next  day the minister of railways would have received a severe  reprimand in the CPSU Central Committee Agitation and Propaganda  Department. What? -- the "voice of the party" might not be heard  by the people! Times are different now, and the press "merely"  helps to realize citizens' constitutional right to timely and  objective information. But this function of the press seems an  empty abstraction to the officials of various ranks who are  accustomed just to severe reprimands and administrative rebukes.  There is no serious counterweight to departmental tyranny in  the government either, which is concerned with more "important"  matters than the timely delivery of newspapers.    There must, however, also be the matter of elementary  respect  for the millions of our fellow citizens who certainly do not  live in capitals. What wrong have they done Mr. Salatov?    Is there a body in our country which is capable of repealing  the decision of the deputy minister of railways? If there is,  when will this happen?</p>

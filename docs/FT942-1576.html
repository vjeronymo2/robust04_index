			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Investment bank set up in Czech Republic Three former executives of CS First Boston's Prague operations yesterday launched the first fully Czech-run investment bank catering to the country's growing number of corporate and private clients. The new bank, Patria Finance, is headed by Mr Zdenek Bakala, who once worked in corporate finance with Drexel Burnham Lambert in New York. Patria Finance has start-up capital of Kcs100m (Dollars 3.57m), and is 75 per cent owned by its management. A group of Swiss investors owns the balance. Mr Bakala said Czech corporate clients are largely ignored in the country's financial services market. Investment banking services are currently offered either by commercial banks as a supplement to their core lending activities or by international investment banks which cater to overseas clients and operate with 'little regard for the specifics of the emerging local capital market'.</p>

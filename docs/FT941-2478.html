			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Easing of media stake rules urged Four of the UK's biggest newspaper groups have told the government that the rules on cross-media ownership must be rescinded if Britain is to take advantage of the multimedia revolution. According to the British Media Industry Group, which includes Associated Newspapers, Telegraph Publishing, the Guardian Media Group and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, the UK rules are the most restrictive in Europe. Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act newspapers are limited to one 20 per cent stake in television companies followed by further stakes of no more than 5 per cent. The group says in its submission to the cross-media ownership review by the National Heritage department that the restrictions need to be abolished to give publishers the right to diversify 'into the new multinational and multimedia market'. The group says that newspapers and other forms of publishing are in long-term decline compared with the rest of the media marketplace. The Independent Television Commission said in its submission to the department that newspapers should be able to have larger stakes in television companies but that the limit should stay below 30 per cent, at least for the time being.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Takashi Sawada, chief researcher, Enterprise </F> Survey Department, Nikko Research Center: "Petrochemical  Industry Reorganization Proceeding With Focus on Big Business  Groupings; MITI No Longer Relied Upon"]    [Text] Recession in the petrochemical industry can be  diagnosed as the "worst ever in the postwar era." The gap  between supply and demand has spread into the whole Asian  market, and consumer needs have changed. To cope with the  structural causes and work out ways to survive, drastic reforms  accompanied by industrial restructuring and personnel  adjustments are unavoidable.  <H5>  Worst Recession Since the War </H5>   For the petrochemical industry, the total profits of the  major (ethylene center) 12 companies is expected to add up to  deficits in fiscal year 1993 approaching 100 billion yen. Hence,  it is falling into the worst postwar recession, even beyond that  of fiscal year 1982 (60.5 billion yen in the red) following the  oil crisis.    Petrochemical products represented by synthetic resins are a  typical cyclical industry, and swings in earnings due to  business cycles have been large before, too. (When demand  increases under favorable conditions, prices rise steeply; and  as increases in facilities and recession weigh heavily, prices  drop sharply.)    However, since the current recession has not only cyclical  causes, but it also has structural causes, the situation is  quite serious.    Structural problems can be categorized into the following  three points:    1. Supply-demand gap widening    The petrochemical industry (like all others) broadly  expanded  its facilities during the bubble era. As it takes three to four  years from a planning decision for facilities to go operational,  increases in the facilities' capacity are still continuing even  now. To look at ethylene facilities, which constitute the  starting point for the production flow of petrochemical  products, in addition to the startup of Mitsubishi  Petrochemical's new plant in the fall of 1992, Maruzen  Petrochemical's plant, whose startup had been delayed, finally  is going into operation this fall [1994].    As a result, the supply-demand gap has widened to the level  of that after the oil crisis and the operating rate has dropped  to around 80 percent.    To look at the demand side on the other hand, demand to date  for petrochemical products has been attaining GNP-plus-alpha  growth through the substitution of plastics for metals, paper,  and so on, but now it has come to a turning point. That is  because such major users as electricals and autos have shifted  production overseas and plastic product imports are steadily  increasing.    2. Falling international competitiveness due to  worsened international demand and the high yen    It was not Japan alone that increased facilities during  economic expansion. The same was true for the United States and  Europe. In the same vein, however, the Republic of Korea's  facility expansion was amazing. It expanded its facilities  threefold in the three years from 1990 to 1992.    To look at ethylene in the Asian region, it appears that  with  demand at about 12 million tons annually there is an excess  facilities capacity of more than 2 million tons. The result is  that, together with prices falling internationally and the rapid  rise in the yen to nearly $1 = 100 yen, differences have widened  between international prices and Japanese domestic prices viewed  on a dollar basis. The pressure of Korean-made synthetic resins  exported to Japan is climbing, and Japan's domestic prices have  plummeted, having been dragged down by international prices.    In the past, Southeast Asian markets were affected in their  prices by Japan's domestic demand, being an escape valve for  excess facilities in Japan. But now the situation has completely  reversed, and Japan's domestic market is affected by demand in  Southeast Asian market.    3. Changes in consumer needs    Finally, one must mention that the demand structure that had  been supporting Japan's petrochemicals has broken down. Japan's  domestic prices for synthetic resins have long been higher than  international prices (the prices at which they sell in countries  other than Japan). This was because qualities such as  appearance, strength, and heat resistance were required of them  for cars, containers, and polyethylene bags. The resin  manufacturers spent huge sums on development costs and  meticulously developed many varieties of resin. This "excessive  product quality" can be said to have supported the growth and  earnings of Japan's petrochemical manufacturers.    However, the times changed and consumers have come to demand  lower prices even at some sacrifice in performance. As a result,  the weight of research and development costs has surfaced all at  once.  <H5>  Inefficient Industry Structure </H5>   Petrochemical companies are more numerous in Japan than in  Europe or the United States but are smaller in scale. This is  because the petrochemical industry is a new industry born after  the war, and anyone could get into it by technology induction if  one had the money.    Besides this, a huge infrastructure of land and port was  needed for the petrochemical complexes, so there were much  regulation and guidance by the government concerning their  formation and growth.    Circumstances being such, the petrochemical industry tends  to  "rely on the government." At the time of the oil crisis the "Law  of Temporary Measures To Improve Industrial Structure" (or Law  on Industrial Structure) was devised by the initiative of MITI  [Ministry of International Trade and Industry] and market  conditions were improved by industry-wide scrapping of  facilities.    This time, however, it does not seem that such solutions can  be taken under government guidance. First, we are in an era in  which leadership by the government is being criticized. In fact,  it cannot be denied that the law on industrial structure, by  letting firms with weak competitiveness survive and protecting  an inefficient industrial structure, has become one cause of the  hard times for today's petrochemical industry.    Next, even if excess facilities in country are scrapped, the  effect of improving market conditions is slight so long as  international demand is not improved.    At present, MITI is studying a project for exporting used  ethylene plants to China; however, since dismantling costs  climbing to huge sums, this has scant chance of being realized.  Moreover, even if it were carried out, one could scarcely expect  any effect of improving market conditions.    Then, might Japan's petrochemical industry go right ahead  and  perish? To state the conclusion, its survival is possible, but  drastic structural reforms are needed that include the  industry's restructuring and personnel adjustments.    When one considers major petrochemical corporations with  some  4,000 employees merging, staffs for the new post-merger  companies' management sectors, sales sectors, and research and  development sectors basically would get by with those of just  one pre-merger firm. As about half of the employees are believed  to be the staffs of such sectors, a cut to about 2,000 people  could be accomplished through a merger, and a rationalization  effect of some 15 billion yen might emerge from it. Even  premising current market conditions, this is a level making it  possible to go into the black.

At present in industrialized nations, petrochemical  industries are living on quite nicely. However, in the United  States and European countries (especially the United States) the  industry has been made more efficient by selling enterprises  during times of recession and by mergers and so on. At the same  time, major manufacturers of chemicals were quick to give up on  general purpose items and have gone strongly into products close  to consumers such as pharmaceuticals or into fine chemical  products with a high added value.    The problems with Japan's petrochemicals are that each  company is small in size, that there are too many companies, and  that in their meticulous development they have put too much into  people and money.    Having so far been a growth industry as it has existed, the  petrochemical industry has set petrochemicals at the core of the  enterprise in each company but has been slow to notice that it  had changed into a declining industry that could not survive  without rationalization.    For petrochemical firms, cutting staffs decisively by  merging  and restructuring is inescapable. At the same time, turning  their reserve power in research and development toward such new  fields as biotechnology and acquiring research and development  capacities on a par with Europe and the United States will be  the only way that Japan's chemical industries can survive into  the 21st century.  <H5>  Next Restructuring To Be Mitsui Group </H5>   Even though the need for restructuring the industry is  understood intellectually, it is difficult to go into mergers  that will bring pain. Particularly in Japan, a company belongs  to its employees, and managers balk at a merger that will wipe  out the company itself. The very way that a company should be is  what stands in the way of industrial restructuring. Yet, it may  be that we are already past the stage for saying such things.  Some companies have reached the end even of their off-the-books  assets and are in a situation where they can no longer wait. In  addition, banks are also straitjacketed by the problem of bad  loans and are losing the leeway to support companies in deficit.    On 24 December 1993, Mitsubishi Kasei and Mitsubishi  Petrochemical Co., Ltd. announced they would merge on 1 October  1994. This move can be seen as their proclamation that they had  given up on any rescue by the government or cartel character for  the industry and would survive on their own power. For firms  still in the process of asking favors of MITI, it was a dash of  cold water and meant they would have to grope for the means of  their own survival.    Scenarios for industry restructuring are seen as proceeding  in two stages: 1) consolidating financial groupings and 2)  rescue mergers by the financial groupings. (See table)    The top-ranking manufacturers in the financial groups stand  out prominently in the aspects both of enterprise development  and firm strength, which includes their off-the-books assets,  and they may become the nuclei for restructuring. Following the  Mitsubishi group, the Mitsui group can achieve vertical  development from raw materials through finished products if it  undertakes mergers including Toray Industries, Inc. (Toray's  president Maeda is busily sending love calls to Mitsui  Petrochemical Industries, Ltd.), and it can give birth to a  powerful chemical company.    Again, all the firms are officially pressing ahead with  cost-cutting by things like rationalization and tieups, working  to get into the black on their own. Yet, the top managers from  the hard-pressed companies seem to be groping for decisive  measures. Both personnel cuts, which so far have been taboo in  Japan, and programs to transfer the middle-aged and seniors to  small and medium enterprises may be pushed ahead as the nucleus.    Around the end of 1995, the appearance of the industry may  differ considerably from today's. With China's economic  development, stagnant international market conditions also can  be expected gradually to recover. We hope that in two or three  years, the industry's restructuring will have reinforced its  character and that a reborn petrochemical industry will be seen.</p>

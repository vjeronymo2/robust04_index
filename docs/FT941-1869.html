			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Compaq Computer to open plant in Brazil Compaq Computer of the US is to build a Dollars 15m assembly plant in Brazil. It should become operational by September, Reuter reports from Sao Paulo. 'Brazil will play a key role for our growth in Latin America,' said Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq president and chief executive officer. He said the plant, which will be located on the outskirts of Sao Paulo, will serve the Latin America and Caribbean region outside Mexico. It will begin by producing desktop models and eventually assemble the full line of Compaq products. Mr Pfeiffer described the planned Brazilian plant as one of 'high volume manufacturing capacity' that would eventually employ around 400 people. He would not comment on production numbers, except to say that it would be in the 'hundreds of thousands of units'. A regional plant should represent substantial production and operational cost-savings, which would be passed on to the consumer, he said. He said the plant was the result of a policy of installing manufacturing operations 'at the heart of our markets'. Compaq has three manufacturing plants - in Texas, Singapore and Scotland - and recently announced plans to open a fourth, in China. Mr Pfeiffer said although the Brazilian plant was due to begin manufacturing by September, the location had not been finalised. The company was looking for an existing building. He said computer peripherals would be provided by traditional suppliers, but added that the company would look into the possibility of buying equipment from Brazilian manufacturers. Mr Manuel Parra, vice-president for Latin America and the Caribbean, said Compaq held around 12 per cent of the 400,000-unit Brazilian personal computer market.</p>

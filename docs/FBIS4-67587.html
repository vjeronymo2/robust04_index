			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kaj Skaaning: "The Energy Minister Puts the </F> Environment Above a Free Energy Market" -- first paragraph is  BERLINGSKE TIDENDE introduction]    [Text] The energy report: The environment must not suffer  when there is energy liberalization, writes the energy minister  in the energy policy report that will be submitted to the  Folketing on Thursday [21 April].    The Danish Government will help support a broader  liberalization of European energy markets only if some  significant prerequisites are fulfilled.    According to the energy policy report, which Energy Minister  Jann Sjursen (Christian People's Party) will submit to the  Folketing on Thursday, the government will emphasize three main  points.    First, there should be a clear connection between an opening  of energy markets and concern for environmental protection.  Second, transitional arrangements should be ensured -- not least  with regard to the young Danish natural gas sector. Third, the  subsidiarity principle should be maintained.    "It is the government's position that the liberalization  proposals not be dealt with in isolation but be seen within a  greater energy policy context in the European Union [EU],"  Sjursen will tell the Folketing on Thursday.  <H5>  EU's Environmental Requirements Should Be Made the Same </H5>   He believes that special emphasis should be put on a greater  effort in the environmental area. A liberalization of the  electricity and gas markets must not be promoted at the cost of  more environmentally sound forms of energy production. Increased  competition should be followed up with joint and more ambitious  EU environmental requirements so competitive conditions will  become the same.    Among other things, the government will work for a common  CO[.sub]2[/] excise fee within the EU, but it will also work  to ensure that the liberalization proposals establish only  overarching principles.    The working out [of details] and their regulation should be  left to member countries.    Denmark is ahead of other countries when it comes to  reducing  CO[.sub]2[/], and in his report Sjursen sticks to a Danish  goal of a 20-percent reduction of CO[.sub]2[/] emissions by  2005 in relation to 1988. And he made no effort to conceal the  fact that special emphasis would be placed on energy consumption  by industry.  <H5>  Industry Must Bear the Brunt </H5>   "The government feels it is crucial that emphasis be put on  making industry's efficiency measures in the area of energy  consumption more cost effective. There is still in fact a  significant potential for further efficiency measures in  industry. If this potential is not utilized, then households  will have to institute even more expensive measures to achieve  the goal while relatively cheap savings possibilities in  industry remain unutilized," Sjursen says in his report.    Sjursen believes that environmental and energy excise fees  can be implemented without reducing competitiveness. Excise fees  should be behavioral in nature and the proceeds be returned to  industries "in a compensatory fashion."    But the average Danish consumer of energy as well is to be  made to alter his behavior. A committee has come out with a  number of recommendations for a greater effort to get consumers  of electrical heat to convert to more energy-efficient forms of  heating.    "The government will now work to see to it that a general  agreement is reached between the energy companies and the  authorities about converting electrical heat," writes Sjursen,  who also believes that in the area of realizing savings on  electricity, "there is still a significant potential that can  realized."</p>

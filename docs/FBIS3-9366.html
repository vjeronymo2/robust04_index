			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Peto, chairman of the Alliance of Free </F> Democrats, by Dezso Pinter; place and date not given: "We Are  Speaking to Those Who Are Expecting Deeds"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Pinter] Have the Hungarian  political front lines become final in recent weeks? Are these  front lines also dividing the liberals?    [Peto] These lines are borders increasingly dividing parties  and groups of parties, and not trenches. The government  coalition, namely the national conservative camp, is united even  though, clearly in view of the election campaign, the Christian  Democratic People's Party [KDNP] is trying to distance itself  from the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] but it is quite  cautious in this endeavor: one step forward and one step back.  However, these two parties will nevertheless take voters away  from each other. On the other side, we find the Hungarian  Socialist Party [MSZP] in a nonparty cooperation with the  National Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions [MSZOSZ], while  the group of liberal parties is a separate camp. Although the  SZDSZ and the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] have  similar positions on basic issues, the liberal parties are also  rivals in the elections. We have always started from the  premise that an SZDSZ-Fidesz cooperation is in our mutual  interest. The SZDSZ thinks that the positions would be weakened  if the two liberal parties sought possible coalition parties  separately or if the SZDSZ and the Fidesz were not in the same  government or opposition camp after the elections. The present  coalition parties are trying to split the liberal forces. For  example, we can hear almost daily that, unlike the SZDSZ, the  Fidesz could be an acceptable coalition partner for the MDF.  [passage omitted]    [Pinter] In your opinion, to what extent will the issue of  Hungarians living beyond our borders and the religious issue  affect voters' decisions?    [Peto] In discussing this issue from the viewpoint of  political competition, people try to present the SZDSZ in a bad  light, as an insensitive and indifferent party. However, this  attempt will not affect the election results. Obviously, those  who continue to regard symbolic gestures as a major way of  treating the issue of Hungarian minorities will not vote for the  SZDSZ. We are speaking to those who are expecting deeds and who  are not taken in by empty rhetoric. Obviously, those who  believe that the SZDSZ is an atheist and anti-clerical party  will not be SZDSZ voters. The SZDSZ attributes great importance  to religious life and an important social role to the churches;  at the same time, as a liberal party, the SZDSZ wants a complete  separation of church and state, and does not find a possible  state ideological role of the church desirable. [passage omitted]    Our views regarding the national minorities have not  changed.  The SZDSZ is fostering close contacts with the political  organizations of Hungarians living beyond our borders, and this  is advantageous for everyone. [passage omitted]    [Pinter] Are new elements emerging in the election campaign?    [Peto] From the beginning, I have noticed manifestations of  discrimination or manipulation and the abuse of government  power, which violate the rules of honest political competition.  However, such attempts are almost always doomed to failure, and  this is reassuring. This does not harm the SZDSZ; on the  contrary! However, this does harm the entire Hungarian democracy  and political style. The control of the mass media, and the  drama of firing journalists from Hungarian Radio are causing  such serious damage to Hungarian democracy that it goes far  beyond the election campaign. If a country can get into the  world's press with reports of a Csurka essay or the firing of  129 radio journalists mostly for political reasons, that country  becomes part of the Balkans in Western public opinion. This  should draw the attention of those who constantly lecture us on  national interests while they fail to consider this nation's  most elementary interests. [passage omitted]    [Pinter] In which areas does the SZDSZ intend to cooperate  with the government and the coalition in order to maintain the  ability to function?    [Peto] When people were fired from the Hungarian Radio for  political reasons in a deliberate violation of the law, some  people in the SZDSZ proposed that we express our indignation by  limiting our parliamentary activity. However, the dominant  position in the SZDSZ is that we should not endanger the ability  of the country and Parliament to function. Parliament should  work as long as it can, because its activity is needed, and the  government should also function to the last minute of its  mandate. If it becomes a government party, the SZDSZ will  follow the customs of developed democracies, and it will not  question the obligations deriving from accepted laws, no matter  what position we took in the course of the legislation.  Compensation and the return of church properties will also be  the task of the new government, and we will guarantee continuity  in this. Of course, there are laws that we will want to change,  but these changes will not make everyday life unpredictable. The  SZDSZ does not want a government change accompanied by tabula  rasa every four years. We have confidence in the members of the  public administration, and we will not initiate any purge for  political reasons. [passage omitted]</p>

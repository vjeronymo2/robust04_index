			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Portillo to shake up training scheme Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, has decided to shake up the main government scheme for training unemployed adults by cutting its funding by a third and introducing performance-related pay for the Training and Enterprise Councils which deliver it. Mr Portillo's initiative reflects growing scepticism, especially in the Treasury, about whether the Pounds 762m spent on Training for Work, the scheme for the adult unemployed, represents good value for money. It also reflects the belief that too many Tecs are failing to deliver good enough outcomes for those who go through the scheme. Only 22 per cent of the 120,000 people who completed six-month courses in England and Wales in 1993-94 had a 'positive outcome', meaning either a job, self-employment, or a move into further education. A further 36 per cent achieved a National Vocational Qualification. In order to improve on these figures, and in particular the number going into jobs, the employment department has decided that from next April all the Tecs in England and Wales will switch to output-related funding. That means about 75 per cent of the funds Tecs receive for putting somebody through Training for Work will be dependent on a positive outcome. At present more than 70 per cent is paid regardless of what happens to the trainee after the course. This will have serious consequences for many of the companies to which Tecs send their trainees. Officials in both government and the Tecs believe that too many companies are making too much money from providing courses which do little to help the unemployed. Many courses concentrate purely on providing people with NVQs with no connection at all to the jobs market. An experiment with output-related funding in 12 Tecs has produced encouraging results. Mr Doug Norris of the North London Tec said that positive outcomes improved from 20 per cent to 49 per cent as a result of the trial. He said: 'The upturn in the economy has helped a bit but it is basically because we are no longer just paying for a process but for an outcome. It has allowed me to kick out the training providers who were not getting results.' Mr Chris Humphries of the Tec National Council said he would welcome a move to output funding for all Tecs. He said: 'This is something which demonstrably works and we have been asking for this for some time.' The Tecs are also likely to welcome the fact that trainees in future will be allowed greater flexibility to do parts of an NVQ rather than the whole qualification. But other aspects of Mr Portillo's package may be less welcome to Tecs. The amount of money available for Training for Work is likely to be cut to less than Pounds 600m. And poorly performing Tecs may have their contract to train the adult unemployed removed from them completely. Some Tec officials also fear that the benefits of the shake-up could be undermined by any attempt - hinted at by Mr Portillo in his speech to the Conservative party conference last week - to make receipt of benefit dependent on taking a training place. 'If anything we should be moving the other way. When training courses are difficult to get on to trainees are much more enthusiastic about them. If they are made compulsory the attitude will be terrible,' said one Tec official. Such a move might also reverse a marked improvement in attitudes towards Training for Work among participants. Opinion research with eight groups of participants by the consultancy Full Employment UK has found a substantial shift compared with two years ago. Most participants now say that they are on proper training schemes and believe that the government is broadly supportive. They also value the fact that the courses are voluntary. Eight groups of unemployed people who are not on courses continued to reflect the negative attitude towards government schemes. Most said that the courses were just a way of keeping the number of registered unemployed down, said Mr Peter Ashby of Full Employment UK.</p>

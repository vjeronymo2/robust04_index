			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Produce groups hit at import damage Food is travelling further than ever before to reach an increasingly sophisticated marketplace. But the distances travelled are causing significant environmental, economic and social damage, according to a report published today by the Safe Alliance, a coalition of groups promoting sustainable agriculture. The alliance's findings show that in the UK the same amount of food is being transported as in 1978, but it is travelling 50 per cent further. In the same period more than a third of the increase in demand for freight has been caused by the transport of food, drink and tobacco, which accounts for only 8.5 per cent of gross domestic product. British demand for air-freighted food from overseas is also on the increase. Imports rose 15 per cent in the first half of the year compared with the same period last year. Mr Hugh Raven, co-ordinator of the Safe Alliance, said: 'The real costs of food miles madness are seldom reflected in the price of food.' He pointed to the costs of diverting land in food-deficit countries from producing for local consumption as well as air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions from air and road transport. The report says it found produce in three central London supermarkets in early September which had been flown thousands of miles in spite of home-grown alternatives being available - apples flown 4,700 miles from the US, onions transported 12,000 miles from Australia and green beans from Kenya. Mr Raven said: 'It's madness to fly food half way round the world when UK growers are going out of business.' The alliance is urging consumers to buy local produce and establish a hierarchy of priorities: first local, then national, then regional produce - from the European Union.</p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Plastic is elastic but the drawbacks can be drastic - Credit card companies are battling for your business as never before. Scheherazade Daneshkhu and Bethan Hutton explain the ins and outs Credit card companies are engaged in a price war, giving consumers more choice than ever before. Instead of simply looking to their own bank for a card, they are almost as likely to apply to another lender. Competition has been spurred by the arrival of new players - mainly from the US - who are anxious to expand into Europe. In addition, issuers, hoping people will start to borrow more as the economy comes out of recession, are working ever harder to attract customers. The main charges Annual fees: These were unknown until 1990 when Lloyds imposed one. Now, most issuers charge Pounds 10-12 a year. Many offer two types of card (for example, Visa/Access and Mastercard) but charge only one annual fee. These include Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Midland, Robert Fleming/S &amp; P and National Westminster. Interest rate: This usually is expressed in terms of an annualised percentage rate (APR), making it easier to compare charges. Most issuers charge interest for cash advances at a higher rate than for purchases. Interest is charged either from the day the cash withdrawal is made (even if you clear your account in full every month) or as a fixed fee, usually of 1.5 per cent of the amount withdrawn. Some issuers will try to attract new borrowers with incentives. The Co-operative bank and the Leeds BS are among those which charge new cardholders a lower rate of interest on debt transferred from their old card. Others, including Barclaycard and Bank of Scotland, rebate a percentage of the transferred debt as an incentive. Interest-free period: It used to be standard practice to charge interest from the statement date for those who did not settle their bill in full. But most issuers now charge from the date the transaction reaches the account. For those who pay off their balance in full every month, the maximum interest-free credit period is 56 days. Some issuers have reduced this, however. Choosing the right card Are you sure yours is the best for you, or should you switch to another issuer? The answer is determined mainly by whether you pay off your bill in full every month, or use the card to borrow. Do you pay in full? This is the best way to use a credit card since you are able to delay payment for purchases without incurring any interest. This type of user need not worry about the APR, and can concentrate on choosing a card with no annual fee. The table includes cards which do not have an annual fee; the large number in Northern Ireland suggests that, off the mainland, annual fees have yet to catch on. Watch out for hidden drawbacks to no-fee cards. The Co-operative bank's Robert Owen card carries a free-for-life pledge, but a Pounds 12 fee is imposed if the card is used less than 10 times a year. The interest-free period is just 46 days and the fee for cash withdrawals is higher than most, at 2 per cent. Similar conditions are applied by Co-operative Retail Services. Some issuers, including Leeds, Bank of Scotland, Halifax and MBNA, will rebate the previous year's annual fee if you charge a minimum amount - upwards of Pounds 1,500 - to the card each year. In any case, MBNA, the international arm of a large US credit card-lender, is waiving its annual Pounds 10 fee for the first two years and Ford Barclaycard is doing the same for one year. Do you use your card to borrow? If you are going to incur interest on your card, the priority is a card with a low APR (see table) and, ideally, one which charges interest from the statement, rather than the transaction, date. Royal Bank of Scotland's Mastercard has a 16 per cent APR (14.5 per cent on balances of Pounds 1,000 and over) and is aimed at those who borrow continually, since there is no interest-free period. Robert Fleming/S&amp;P was one of the first into the credit card battlefield, reducing its APR to 14.6 per cent. But, like other card issuers offering good deals, it is choosy about its customers. The few issuers to charge from the statement date include Bank of Cyprus, Coutts, First Trust Bank (NI) and Standard Chartered. Using the card abroad Convenience when travelling is an important selling point for many credit card-issuers. But can 'flexible friends' really bend themselves to every situation? Travellers in France have had their plastic cards rejected or even swallowed by cash dispensers, automatic vending machines and stores displaying clearly the Visa/Carte Bleu sign. The problem has arisen because modern French credit cards incorporate a microchip to beat fraud while British ones have only a low-tech magnetic strip. Visa has been educating shops and restaurants in France about how to deal with foreign cards but you could still encounter problems. If your card is rejected, and your linguistic skills are up to it, you could explain that foreign cards need to be swiped through a different slot on the electronic terminal. Alternatively, the vendor can confirm your card's validity over the telephone with the central processing office. If systems elsewhere reject your Visa or Access card, the fault could be with the magnetic strip but, again, the transaction can be confirmed by telephone. Exchange rates Another problem with using credit cards abroad is that you have no control over what exchange rate is used for the transaction. Card processors use the rate applying when the transaction is posted to your account, which could be anything from a few days to weeks or months after you use it. The two main card systems, Visa and Mastercard, set their own exchange rates, a fraction of a percentage point above the wholesale currency market exchange rate. But the card issuer is free to add its own mark-up to the basic exchange rate. This can be as much as 3 per cent. This might throw out your budget calculations; even so, it is usually better than you might get at tourist currency exchange counters. Perks The various perks being used by card issuers to attract custom range from air miles (NatWest and Ulster Bank) and discounts on holidays booked through a travel club (many issuers including Halifax, Bank of Scotland, Royal Bank of Scotland, AIB, Yorkshire Bank) to large rebates on new cars (Ford/Barclaycard and GM Card/Vauxhall). Perks should not generally be a deciding factor in your choice of card, as only really big spenders tend to get the full benefit. Most systems award you points for every Pounds 10 you spend. To get the maximum Pounds 2,500 discount on a new Vauxhall by using the GM card, for example, you would have to spend Pounds 50,000 over five years. Likewise, to qualify for the full Pounds 1,800 Ford discount with accumulated Barclaycard Profiles points, you would have to spend Pounds 36,000 over three years. Profiles points also can be used on items in a catalogue. To qualify for a set of five paintbrushes, you would need to spend Pounds 1,900. To take your partner for a two-night Scottish break, you would have to rack up Pounds 25,000 and pay an extra Pounds 40. The main function of points-based systems is to encourage people to use one card rather than another if they have a choice, or to use a credit card rather than debit card, cheque or cash. Travel discounts through credit card holiday clubs do not rely on points but they do restrict your choice of tour operator - you might still get a better deal elsewhere. Card protection plans Losing a wallet full of plastic, through carelessness or theft, can be a nightmare. Protection plans aim to simplify the process by registering all your cards centrally so you call one number to cancel them all. They also provide an insurance element, covering your liabilities if cards are used fraudulently, and providing an emergency cash loan if you are stranded away from home. Other services include a lost key return service and registration of documents. Protection plans usually are bought through one of the many card issuers but the schemes themselves are run by two providers: CCP and Sentinel. The cost ranges from Pounds 7-8 for one year, to Pounds 32 for five years.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE BETTER BUYS: CREDIT CARDS WITH LOW INTEREST RATES OR NO FEES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                              Fee      APR %      APR % Company/(card name)       TYPE              (pa)   (purchs)     (cash)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bank of Cyprus (Ldn)      Visa               Nil       19.6       20.3 Bnk of Ireland (NI)       M'Card/Visa        Nil       26.0       26.0 Barclays (Ford B'card)    M'Card/Visa         **       21.9       23.8 Beneficial (Classic)      Visa               Nil       22.5       24.3 Co-Op (Robert Owen)       Visa               ***      22.42      24.92 CRS Ltd (Shareholder)     Visa               ***      22.42      24.92 First Trust Bnk (NI)      Visa               Nil       26.0       26.0 HFC/Vauxhall (GM card)    M'card/Visa        Nil       19.9       19.9 Leeds                     Visa           Pds 12*       19.9      21.72 MBNA International        Visa              ****       17.9       13.9 National &amp; Provincial     Visa               Nil       21.6       21.6 Northern (NI)             M'card/Visa        Nil       25.3       25.3 Robert Fleming/S&amp;P        M'card/Visa     Pds 12       14.6       16.1 Royal Bank Scotland       M'card             Nil       16.0       16.0 Standard Chartered        Visa               Nil       29.8       29.9 TSB (Trustcard)           M'card/Visa        Nil       22.9       23.4 Ulster Bank (NI)          Access/Visa        Nil      26.08      26.08 Yorkshire Bank            Visa               Nil       23.1       23.7  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  Cash    Int free                                                 w'dwl      period Company/(card name)       TYPE                fee (%)      (days)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bank of Cyprus (Ldn)      Visa Nil                1.5          56 Bnk of Ireland (NI)       M'Card/Visa           *****          56 Barclays (Ford B'card)    M'Card/Visa             1.5          56 Beneficial (Classic)      Visa                    1.5          56 Co-Op (Robert Owen)       Visa                  *****          46 CRS Ltd (Shareholder)     Visa                  *****          46 First Trust Bnk (NI)      Visa                  *****          56 HFC/Vauxhall (GM card)    M'card/Visa           *****          52 Leeds                     Visa                    1.5          56 MBNA International        Visa                  *****          56 National &amp; Provincial     Visa                  *****          51 Northern (NI)             M'card/Visa           *****          56 Robert Fleming/S&amp;P        M'card/Visa             1.5          56 Royal Bank Scotland       M'card                *****           0 Standard Chartered        Visa                    1.5          56 TSB (Trustcard)           M'card/Visa             1.5          56 Ulster Bank (NI)          Access/Visa           *****          56 Yorkshire Bank            Visa                    1.5          56  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Moneyfacts.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ***** No cash w'drawal fee but interest charged daily from date of       withdrawal even if account cleared in full.    ** Annual fee of Pounds 10 waived for first year.   *** Pounds 12 fee if card not used min 10 times pa.     * Cardholders who charged at least Pounds 1,500 to card last       year will have annual fee refunded.  **** Fee Pounds 10 pa waived for first two years.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

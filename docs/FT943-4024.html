			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Arts: Inspired by organised chaos - Venice Film Festival / Nigel Andrews thoroughly enjoys the inspired madness embodied in this week's on-screen offerings The Venice Film Festival has reached an alarming stage. Instead of feeling as we critics should during these events - like hardworking martyrs to art with subtitles permanently dancing before our eyes - we have been enjoying almost every new movie. From the latest Woody Allen comedy Bullets Over Broadway we jaunt over to a midnight Harrison Ford romp, Clear And Present Danger. From a jolly Spanish film about love and acrobatics, The Tit And The Moon, we proceed to a nailbiting, inspired Danish TV series about a haunted hospital, The Kingdom, before skipping over to Heavenly Creatures, a truth-based New Zealand black comedy about two schoolgirls who murder for their friendship. Jury president David Lynch was seen leaving this last in a glow of approbation, so the Golden Lion may reach a long paw into the Antipodes next Monday. Heavenly Creatures was co-written and directed by Peter Jackson, best known for spoof splatter films like Brain Dead. Here he has held back on the flying intestines but not the sense of camp hyperbole. This 1950s Christchurch is awash with picket-fence prettiness and twittering moral decency - Lynch territory par excellence - as Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet (Kate Winslet) form their fantasy-filled friendship. This is fed by their own tales of castles and kings, and served by Jackson's blithe camera arabesques and transformation scenes. Gasp at the Sound Of Music-style helicopter shot of Juliet running over a hill; gasp again when that landscape is metamorphosed into a lush palace garden. Unicorns, fountains, butterflies large as hang-gliders .. It all ends in blood and tears, as the two girls' parents, who condemn the friendship as 'unhealthy' and 'unwholesome', predict it will. But for the audience, what a movie ride before we hit the buffers. The only other Venice movie on this scale of robust postmodernism - witty exaggeration built into the po-faced melodrama - was Lars Von Trier's The Kingdom. This is not a movie at all but more a four-part, 4 1/2 -then-two-hour TV series, shot with a handheld camera in poverty-row monochrome. But it proves the Danish director of acclaimed style-pieces The Element Of Crime and Europa can turn on the magic without tricksy optical effects. In this Lynch-lore festival you could call The Kingdom 'Twin Peaks in a hospital': teasingly quotidian setting; weirder and weirder characters; emergency outbreaks of non-sequitur; the apocalypse of ghosts and guilty secrets. But Trier and Niels Vorsel's script has a start-to-finish logic that Peaks never quite had. Its perfectly meshed characters - the sarcastic Swedish neuro-consultant, the solemnly deranged anatomy lecturer, the hypochondriacal old lady who hears 'voices' in the lift shaft - give the story a strong, even Ibsenite, vertebra, while the wacky toll of severed heads, masonic rituals and self-destruct surgery provides the gymnastic freedom of narrative. In the vain quest for a dud film at this festival we critics tried everything. A Woody Allen film without Woody? That might be a trial. But no  -it was Bullets Over Broadway, a sparkling comedy of theatre manners, with gangsters, gags and the funniest not-by-Woody performance in the entire Allen cannon. This was Dianne Wiest's vainglorious actress: sighing, soaring, scatterbrained, Gloria Swanson crossed with Margaret Dumont. Then there was the movie from Spain's Bigas Luna, late of Goldenballs, about the little boy, his older pal and the big-breasted circus ballerina they fight over. Tiresome Fellini rip-off? No. Charming, stylish and funny. How about Jefery Levy's SFW? This rock-scored, kaleidoscopic US movie is about a young hostage-crisis survivor (Backbeat's Stephen Dorff), who after 36 days in a convenience store at the mercy of a lunatic's video-camera whose images were broadcast 'live' across the nation, tries to adjust to the vulgar glare of media heroism. It threatens to be a glib, easy-target topical melodrama but gains in wit and bite as it goes on. The only undisputed flops have been Alexandre Rockwell's Somebody To Love - a drippy New York love story set among what seem to be the underworld folk left over from Woody Allen's film - and Ermanno Olmi's The Bible Part 1. This is subtitled Genesis: Creation And Flood - and yes, Olmi plans to film the entire Good Book. Not like this, we hope. The Noah sequence aside, with its eye-catching ark and brief warmth of human detail, the film is no more than a glorified nature documentary set to a maunderingly 'prophetic' voice-over. The Olmi style seems even more ossified in a festival that has just produced Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers. Some people loved this film, some hated it. The only sane response is to do both. Based on a story by Hollywood's favourite enfant terrible Quentin Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction), the movie is a two-hour bloodbath. The main terrorists are a young couple (Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis) who, after a cross-country murder spree in the film's first half, repeat the mayhem when they break out of jail in the second. That Oliver Stone was becoming an eccentric film-maker we knew from the St Vitus style of JFK. But even that seems measured beside the poetic epilepsy of this film. Manic jump-cuts; topsy-turvy angles; high-speed alternations between black-and-white and colour, film and video, reality and hallucination; split-second bits of newsreel, animation. Since the soundtrack also bawls out rock music, some have called the whole thing a feature-length pop promo. But it is much more. Despite the suspect encouragement it might offer susceptible filmgoers - that killing is exhilarating - it is inspired. The fragmented approach is not arbitrary. Stone offers us different ways of viewing the same story at the same time: documentary, fantasy, home movie, even sitcom. Scenes from the girl's childhood are enacted as clips from a TV comedy series, with comic Rodney Dangerfield as Dad and canned laughter greeting each dialogue exchange. Later, Stone derides the couch potato culture again in the figure of an Aussie-accented tabloid-TV interviewer (Robert Downey Jr, very funny) who follows the couple's jailbreak live. Natural Born Killers is an alarming work, and for some a demented one. (Tarantino himself has disowned the movie). But you cannot expect tranquil responses to a film that proposes a whole new direction for film-making itself - and that never offers spectators the soft option of a single, moralising perspective on its bloody subject.</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Austrian carrier expects to break even this year Austrian Airlines should break even this year, according to Mr Mario Rehulka, the joint chief executive, Reuter reports from Vienna. Plans presented at yesterday's annual meeting see turnover rising to Sch11.1bn (Dollars 917m) from Shl10.5bn, while pre-tax losses should be cut to Sch351m from Sch728m. Net losses are forecast at Sch140m, but it should be possible to cancel these with cost cutting, Mr Rehulka said.

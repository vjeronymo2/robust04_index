			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRANSTON AND LINCOLN S&amp;L  </P> <P> Some comment on "3 Elderly Women Blame Cranston for Swindle" (Part A, Nov. 15).  They claim that uninsured American Continental bonds were purchased assuming  that they were insured. If they were told that the bonds were insured by  Lincoln S&amp;L personnel, then they have a valid complaint.  </P> <P> I'm well aware many seniors are not sophisticated about financial matters.  However, I believe some seniors only see the higher investment rate and fail to  see the higher risk. Finally, some are simply greedy and may have only  themselves to blame.  </P> <P> As for Cranston and the other four senators, if the allegations are true, I,  like most Americans, am very disappointed.  </P> <P> JIM NISHIZAKA  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

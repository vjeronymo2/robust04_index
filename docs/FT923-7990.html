			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / People: Reshuffle at Soc Gen in London Societe Generale has promoted Patrick Pagni (left), boss of its UK securities operation Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull (SGST), to become general manager of the London branch and UK general manager. Pagni succeeds Jean Huet, who moves to New York to take charge of the French bank's US network. Pagni, 43, is a high flyer originally from the international division in Paris; he spent four years as the senior officer in Hong Kong between 1984 and 1988, with spells in Los Angeles, and, briefly, New York, beforehand. His achievements at SGST, where he took over as boss at the end of 1990, have been mainly to supervise the expansion of equities sales and research at the traditional Eurobond house, 'though we are not home yet,' he admits. His place at SGST is taken by Paul Tisch, 46, (right) who has been at Strauss since 1970, recently in charge of the equities division. Another Strauss veteran, Keith White, 44, at the firm since 1963, becomes deputy chief executive, retaining control of the Eurobond side. In turn, David Attard, 39, who arrived from S G Warburg Securities two years ago, steps into Tisch's shoes.</p>

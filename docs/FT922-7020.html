			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: AMB wins AGF share ruling AACHENER &amp; Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), Germany's second largest insurance company, has won an important courtroom victory over the status of the large minority stake in the company held by Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the state-owned French insurer. The Regional Court of Aachen decided the Vorstand - or managing board - of AMB was within its rights not to register the voting rights attached to 19 per cent of AMB out of the 25 per cent-plus owned by AGF. Under German company law, the right to accord voting rights on special types of registered shares belongs to the incumbent management. The French company said it disagreed with the ruling, and would continue attempts to have the shares registered. It maintains that its intentions towards AMB are friendly. The AMB Vorstand, however, believes AGF to be making a scarcely-veiled attempt to win management control. AGF argued before the court that AMB's tactics were frustrating its own European development strategy, namely closer alliance with Fondiaria, the leading Italian insurance group which now owns 20 per cent of AMB, and with Royal Insurance of the UK. According to Mr Piers von Simson, a director of SG Warburg, the London investment bank advising the AMB Vorstand, the court's decision would put pressure on AGF to enter further talks over co-operation. Earlier attempts stalled over the question of registering the shares.</p>

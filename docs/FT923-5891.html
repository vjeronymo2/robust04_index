			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices steady in nervous trade A STRONGLY worded comm-ittal to the pound's place in the European Monetary System from the UK chancellor of the exchequer, followed by heavy support for sterling from the Bank of England, checked the slide in UK equity markets yesterday but did little to restore confidence in the near-term outlook. Market strategists were not convinced that the UK government will succeed in riding out the crisis in sterling without raising domestic interest rates. The FT-SE Index closed four points up at 2,285, unable to recapture the early gain of 11.8 which had greeted the Bank's foreign exchange support operations. Equities turned down smartly at mid-morning after a member of the Bundesbank policy council rejected hints of an ERM realignment and appeared to put the pound in the spotlight again. A further blow came later when the latest Maastricht opinion poll in France indicated a 52 per cent 'no' vote. The stock market was much quieter yesterday following the blood-letting of the previous session. Seaq volume dropped back again to a total of 374.8m shares, compared with 537.7m the previous day. The value of retail, or customer, business on Tuesday jumped to Pounds 1.1bn, confirming that the institutions had been active sellers of stock in the big blue chip issues. Some traders claimed to indentify a more positive mood in the market towards the close yesterday and hoped that the Bank's massive support for the pound might be the first step in a concerted plan to avoid any increase in UK base rates. However, most strategists felt that the chancellor's announcement had been 'very badly handled' and that the London financial markets are in for a 'very uncertain period'. Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull said a rise of  3/4 percentage point in UK base rates is already priced into London money rates, and that if the authorities are forced to lift base rates, then a full percentage point increase might not now be enough to restore stability to the currency. Share prices made an uncertain pattern. There were strong recoveries in some  - but not all  - of the retail and consumer stocks, which have been particularly threatened by interest rate worries. Dollar stocks also turned in a better performance. Dealers warned, however, that equities were fuelled yesterday by the tightness of marketmakers' positions after two sessions of heavily falling share prices. A few buyers, usually from rival marketmakers, was enough to send prices ahead. Whether yesterday's recovery will stand up to any attempted renewal of the sales pressure seen on Tuesday must remain open to question. At best, the stock market's condition remained fragile. Securities analysts at the London-based securities firms were beginning to reconsider year-end forecasts for the Footsie in the light of the gloomier investment picture which has emerged this week. Increases in base rates would inevitably undermine corporate recovery prospects and cast fresh clouds over the outlook for company profits and dividend payments.</p>

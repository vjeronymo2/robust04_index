			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Japan bucks trend in government bond markets For the fourth consecutive month, most government bond markets fell in May, according to JP Morgan's government bond index. Japan was the only exception, topping the local currency performance charts for the second straight month with a return of 1.2 per cent. Japanese bonds have been supported by the country's sluggish economy, low interest rates and receding inflation. European government bonds were worst hit, falling 1.75 per cent on the month, bringing the year-to-date performance to minus 5.22 per cent, compared with minus 3.5 per cent in the year to date for the US bond market and minus 4.08 per cent on the global index. European falls were caused by concern that monetary easing may be coming to an end. Germany was Europe's top performer, with a loss of 0.66 per cent in May in spite of the half-point cut in the Bundesbank's discount rate to 4 1/2 per cent. In spite of a spate of corruption scandals which caused the 10-year yield to vault to 9.8 per cent, Spain was the second-strongest European market, losing 0.71 per cent in May. Europe's worst performer was the UK market, which lost 3.78 per cent on inflation expectations, bringing the year-to-date loss to 11.29 per cent. US bonds only shed 0.06 per cent in May, but the market remains nervous. 'With jobs growth replacing interest rates as the force behind increased spending in the US economy, investors are becoming increasingly concerned with the Fed's ability to contain the risk of upward price pressures,' the report states.</p>

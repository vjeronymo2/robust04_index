			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART;  </P> <P> SHOWS BY STRONG YOUNG ARTISTS, OLDIES BREAK THE DROUGHT;  </P> <P> OFFERINGS AT GUGGENHEIM GALLERY AT CHAPMAN COLLEGE, ORANGE COAST COLLEGE ART  GALLERY AND GALLERIES IN LAGUNA BEACH AND NEWPORT BEACH OFFER A RANGE OF  TECHNIQUES.  </P> <P> The winter art drought is letting up here and there, with shows of work by  strong younger artists from Southern California and a group of golden (and  not-so-golden) oldies from the '60s.  </P> <P> Guggenheim Gallery at Chapman College is awash in an outpouring of paintings  and mixed-media constructions by a young Philippine artist, Manuel Ocampo, who  now lives in Los Angeles. His bizarrely apropos art background consists of  drawing cartoons for an underground newspaper and copying religious paintings  for the Roman Catholic Church.  </P> <P> Although reminiscent at times of the folkloric simplicity and outspoken  personal anguish associated with Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, his art is really  a different kind of animal. Brash and nervy, it mingles the outer shell of  passion with a cool, self-conscious inventiveness that shamelessly borrows from  the history of Western political, religious and avant-garde art. Ocampo's  central theme is the Philippines' pervasive lack of self-definition, as the  only country in Southeast Asia that became subject to Western colonialism  before it had developed its own centralized government or advanced culture.  </P> <P> His images are paintings of imaginary bloody martyrs and violent events, mock  posters invoking a call to action or an outpouring of despair, still lifes  suffused with religious imagery and three-dimensional constructions that  suggest the sorry residue of fantasized scenes of defiance.  </P> <P> These pieces, produced in a bewildering variety of styles, offer a grab bag of  cathartic ways of coming to terms with the bottled up emotions of a people who  experienced 333 years of Spanish rule, 48 years of U.S. government, more than  two decades of dictatorship under Ferdinand Marcos and an ongoing American  military presence. Many of the works are spuriously dated -- 1917, 1948, 1981  -- to reinforce the fictive sense of a shared history of personal involvement  in the country's direction.  </P> <P> Some of Ocampo's pieces include swastikas, which -- along with the gruesomeness  of some of the imagery -- reportedly have upset some gallery visitors. But the  swastikas clearly are meant as emblems of oppression, and the bloody scenes  reflect Catholic folk tradition, political struggle and -- seemingly --  self-inflicted psychological wounds.  </P> <P> At Orange Coast College Art Gallery in Costa Mesa, meticulously painted images  on coolly well-proportioned ceramic sculptures of female figures by Barbara  Dorris are meditations on the mysteries of internal physical experience -- most  vividly, the process of conception and the ravaging of the body by disease.  </P> <P> On the cross-section of a woman's torso, a pair of hands perform legerdemain  with an egg and a towel enclosing a small flame. Deer run down the side of one  hip. These delicately allusive metaphoric images conjure up both physical event  and bodily sensation: the initial creation of life and the movements of a fetus  in the womb.  </P> <P> In "The Visitation," the figure is a bust-length woman's figure, sheared off at  one shoulder. Painted in luminous, matter-of-fact detail on the surface of this  cross-section are two large green and orange bugs crawling over a lump of earth  on clean red flagstones just beyond a closed white door. The juxtaposition of  the well-manicured threshold of a house -- a bastion of security and  orderliness -- with the quietly persistent rhythms of insect life offers a  vivid image for the doggedly invasive force of cancer.  </P> <P> A rain of fire falling on an umbrella blown inside-out and ringed with burning  tapers ("Dermis") is a metaphor for the resilient -- but thin and infinitely  sensitive -- layers of human skin. The vertically amputated torso figure on  which this image is painted lists slightly to one side, as if mirroring the  vulnerability of the human body. For Dorris -- long in possession of an  effortless technique but in search of meaningful subject matter -- this series  marks a personal breakthrough in its exquisitely empathic treatment of the  body.  </P> <P> A pair of low-key meditations on ecological themes by Cynthia Kastan and Mary  Linn Hughes sit comfortably under the umbrella, "The Nature of Things," at BC  Space in Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> Kastan takes black-and-white aerial photographs of sprawling landscapes in  various U.S. locations and turns them into photo-silk screens, printed  off-register (to create a sense of depth) and overlaid with brightly colored  lines and squiggles.  </P> <P> In the manner of ancient South American earthworks, these patterns turn the  contours of rivers, valleys and plains into the outlines of grandly scaled  images and vignettes: a fish, a face, a fanciful creature chasing an antelope.  The suggestion is that the distance of long-range contemplation reveals a  spiritual presence that still inhabits our much-beleaguered natural resources.  </P> <P> The margins of some of these pieces also include images of a broad range of  human and animal life. In "Facets: Stretch," photographs of film actors, a  bare-chested masked performer, acrobatic monkeys, a creeping lizard and a  forward-lurching dinosaur skeleton seem to be engaged in a global demonstration  of the word stretch, as if to indicate the ties that bind the kingdom of the  animals. It's a worthy idea, and yet one wants the piece to reveal a more  intricate and sophisticated visual syntax that goes beyond a simple system of  equivalences.  </P> <P> Hughes' untitled installation soothes the senses immediately, with sounds of  running water and an atmospheric scattering of sharply scented eucalyptus  leaves on the floor. Crunching through them, the viewer passes an invitingly  touchable plot of grass, circles a heaped cord of wood in the center of the  gallery, spots a hanging stuffed bird and a motto framed in chicken bones, and  finally reads a message chalked across a wall. The message -- which invokes a  list of famous dead people whose molecules are still circulating in the  universe -- asks the viewer to consider that "no life is isolated from other  life."  </P> <P> There are some problems here. Moralizing or lecturing to the viewer is usually  a sure way for a work of art to commit hara-kiri. The stuffed bird adds an  unwanted reminder of cliched wildlife art and the bone-framed sentiment ("There  is no way around the fact that we are involved with each other") is  embarrassingly over-earnest and redundant. And yet, Hughes has softened and  seduced the viewer with her tactile, aromatic evocation of the natural world.  This piece has an undeniable charm, and its simple but grandly significant  message lingers compellingly in the mind.  </P> <P> LJB Gallery in Newport Beach is walking down memory lane with a bunch of  paintings and other pieces by some fondly remembered figures from California  art of the swinging '60s, courtesy of Jackie Stuart, the widow of Los Angeles  gallery owner David Stuart. Although much of the work seems to have been chosen  with the flighty tastes of Orange County in mind, and some notable names are  represented by so-so work, there are a few treats here.  </P> <P> Most generously served is Robert Dowd, whose loopy, wildly oversize paintings  of American folding money linger lovingly on the ornate seals, the patterned  intricacies of steel engraving and numismatists' dreams of finding valuable  printing errors. Not to mention Dowd's fantasies -- to contemporary eyes,  all-too-prescient -- of a conflation of greenbacks and art, as in "Picasso  Dollar," in which a Picassoid woman's head replaces George Washington's.  </P> <P> Llyn Foulkes -- like Dowd, an artist whose work was included in Newport Harbor  Art Museum's "L.A. Pop in the '60s" exhibition last year -- also comes on  strong. One of his oddly anthropomorphic landscapes, "Ercha's Rock," a large  image of a craggy outcropping, is paired with a handwritten fragment of prose  ("The rock hung without the man"). The painted frame reinforces the sense that  this work is a self-conscious artifact of the imagination -- a grand,  semi-serious parody of the tradition of the Western novel.  </P> <P> John Altoon's untitled watercolor of three figures offers his inimitable  serendipitous way with jabs, scribbles and rushes of color. Lumbering and  delicate forms nudge each other in teasing ways, and the color has a joyous,  springtime feel. William Copley's all-over patterns of tiny figures and jokey  tete-a-tete ("Now No") still retain a happy-go-lucky appeal.  </P> <P> But nothing else really sings any more. James Strombotne's paintings look glum  and awkward. The Peter Voulkos pieces are small and tame, compared to the wild,  galumphing works that set the hitherto tame world of ceramics on its ear.  Hassel Smith has done many more striking abstract paintings. Could we ever have  found any substance in Mel Ramos' airbrushed cuties? Did anyone ever take  Laurence Dreiband's male fantasies of teenie-boppers seriously? What a long  time ago it was.  </P> <P>  Work by Manuel Ocampo remains through April 22 at Guggenheim Gallery, Chapman  College, 333 N. Glassell St., Orange.

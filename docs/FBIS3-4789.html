In fact, some think that the presence of that  organization in their company is a thorn in their side, a BISNIS  source reported here.    One businessman said that his company rejected an SPSI PUK  (Shop Steward) even though two years ago he stated before the  MUSPIDA [Congress of Provincial Heads] that he would help form  that labor organization. "The important thing is that we have  fulfilled all our obligations and that we have complied with all  labor regulations in a proper way," said that businessman, who  asked that his name not be mentioned.    According to the latest figures from the South Kalimantan  Department of Manpower only 81 of 462 companies in that province  have allowed their workers to join that labor organization. "We  have repeatedly told them how important it is to have a PUK from  the SPSI in a company, but the companies just pay no attention  to that suggestion," said one official of the agency.    Syakhrian Sulaiman, Deputy Chairman of the DPD (Provincial  Executive Board) of the SPSI verified those statements and  expressed his regrets that the business community in this  province still does not regard the SPSI as a business partner  but rather as a 'bogey-man'.    He said that for no obvious reason 28 large companies have  disallowed SPSI PUKs in their companies. In addition, there are  also about 30 companies which are not registered with SPSI's  DPD. Not having an SPSI PUK in a company can invite labor  disputes to surface in the form of strikes or demonstrations  which are damaging to both parties. "If there is an SPSI PUK in  the company, at the very least the problem can be overcome or it  might never occur," affirmed South Kalimantan's SPSI Deputy  Chairman.    He said that Law Number 21 of 1954 is not going as well as  expected due to the absence of a labor organization in a  company. A KKB (Joint Labor Agreement) between employers and  employees is there to prevent possible disputes from arising.  "That's why HIPs (PANCASILA [Five Principles of the Nation]  Industrial Relations), such as those proposed by the government,  are not going as well as expected in companies which have no  SPSI PUK," said Syakhrian.    Based on figures taken from the Banjarmasin branch of Astek  [Workmen's Insurance] Inc, there were 1,010 occupational  accidents in 1993 and 951 in the previous year. BUMNs  [State-Owned Corporations] under the Department of Manpower paid  out 842 million rupiahs in compensation.    The amounts of compensation were: 762 JKK (Occupational  Accident Insurance) cases; 179 JHT (Old-age Insurance) cases;  and 77 JK (Life Insurance) cases. The main cause of occupational  accidents was negligence.</p>

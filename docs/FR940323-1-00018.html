			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4603(a)(2) of OBRA '90 further amended section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1902(e)(6) to require States to provide continuous coverage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to any pregnant woman eligible under section 1902(a)(10) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act who would otherwise lose her eligibility due to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change in income. The pregnant woman must be ``deemed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to be'' a mandatory categorically needy individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described under sections 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1902(1)(1)(A) through the end of the postpartum period. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OBRA '90 amendment also stated that this mandatory coverage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not apply in the case of a woman who has received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ambulatory prenatal care under section 1920 of the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during a presumptive eligibility period and is then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined to be ineligible for regular Medicaid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although section 1902(e)(6) purports to cover all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pregnant women who, because of a change in family income,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not otherwise continue to be eligible for Medicaid, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that it does not automatically cover all pregnant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> women who must meet a spenddown. Most pregnant women  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seeking to meet a spenddown would be attempting to establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility as medically needy. Section 1902(e)(6) now  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires that a State deem a pregnant woman (who has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established eligibility under any eligibility group) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to be a pregnant woman under sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV) and 1902(1)(1)(A) if that woman would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise cease to be eligible due to a change in income.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A medically needy woman can establish her eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during a given budget period by spending down her excess  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income. However, if she has the excess income in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following budget period and is ineligible because she cannot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spend it down, we do not believe that her ineligibility has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulted from a ``change'' in income. In fact, her income is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unchanged for eligibility purposes if it remains in excess  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the medically needy income level by the same amount as in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the previous budget period; she has simply not been able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spend down to the medically needy income level. We believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that under the statute, a medically needy pregnant woman  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whose family income does not change and who cannot meet her  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spenddown does not qualify as having the ``change'' in income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contemplated by section 1902(e)(6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are uncertain how to apply section 1902(e)(6) in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> context of pregnant women who have a spenddown, and whose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> family incomes increase, causing this spenddown amount to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase. We propose to cover under this provision any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pregnant woman who was eligible (either as categorically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needy, medically needy without a spenddown, or medically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needy after meeting a spenddown) at any time during her  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pregnancy, who then experiences a change in family income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which either would cause her to lose categorically needy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid, medically needy Medicaid without a spenddown, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to lose eligibility (be unable to meet the increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spenddown although she would have met the earlier spenddown)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by virtue of an increased spenddown amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We would interpret section 1902(e)(6) so that it will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not relieve pregnant women who qualify under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1902(e)(6) of their obligation to satisfy their original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spenddown amount in each budget period while in section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1902(e)(6) status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a pregnant woman who has in the previous budget  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period met a spenddown has an increase in income and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifies under section 1902(e)(6), she must be ``deemed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to be'' a pregnant woman under sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV) and 1902(1)(1)(A). These provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> describe categorically needy eligibility groups with respect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to whom the limited Medicaid benefit is available. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that the phrase ``deemed to continue to be'' is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ambiguous. The phrase can mean that the woman is to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarded for all purposes as if she were actually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categorically needy, or only that she is to be considered as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categorically needy for the purpose of receiving the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restricted service package that applies to pregnant women  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in section 1902(1) without regard to the change in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> her family's income. If we were to regard the woman as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> though she were actually categorically needy, she would no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer have to meet any spenddown, and any subsequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes of income would not affect her eligibility. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would place the medically needy pregnant woman whose income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has increased in a better position than any other medically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needy pregnant woman with a spenddown who has had no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase in income.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to avoid the anomalous result of only pregnant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> women with higher incomes being relieved of their total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spenddown obligations, we propose not to interpret section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1902(e)(6) as requiring that a medically needy woman be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered as though she were categorically needy for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes. We propose instead to interpret the phrase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``deemed to continue to be'' in section 1902(e)(6) to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only that a woman who meets her original spenddown amount,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but cannot meet the increased amount, be deemed to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible for the limited service package provided to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1902(1) pregnant women. The woman can maintain this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deemed status without having to pay any increased spenddown  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amounts which result from increases in family income. She  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will, however, be required to continue to meet her original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spenddown while in section 1902(e)(6) status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We propose to revise redesignated &sect;435.918 relating to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redetermination of eligibility, to provide that the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must consider a pregnant woman eligible under any Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility group as an individual who is eligible to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive the services available to the mandatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categorically needy low-income group throughout the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pregnancy and for the specific postpartum period after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pregnancy ends without regard to changes in the family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Qualified Children  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4601(a)(2) of OBRA '90 amended the definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a qualified child in section 1905(n)(2) of the Act,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective July 1, 1991. Under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(III) of the Act, a State must provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid coverage to the mandatory group of qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children. Effective July 1, 1991, under the new definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of qualified child added by OBRA '90, a State must provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid coverage to children under the age of 19 who were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> born after September 30, 1983, and who meet the income and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resource requirements of the State plan under title IV&hyph;A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The option in section 1905(n)(2) for a State to include as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualified children those children born after an earlier date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than September 30, 1983 (as chosen by the State) was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retained. As a result, effective July 1, 1991, States have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the option to provide Medicaid coverage to children under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the age of 19 who were born after any date prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 30, 1983 (as chosen by the State) who meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income and resource requirements of title IV&hyph;A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

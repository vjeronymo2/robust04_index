			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / UK Gilts: Traders undecided on outlook GILT YIELDS fell slightly as investors were caught undecided about the market's direction over the next few months. Although recessionary conditions in the UK are unlikely to abate for some time, political and supply factors may push up yields ahead of the general election. Last week, almost all the movement in the market was at the short-maturing end of the yield curve, where yields for gilts maturing over the next three years moved down by as much as 10 basis points (0.1 per cent). Elsewhere, the change was much more muted. The switch by investors towards this end of the curve was in line with the general perception that base rates, now at 10.5 per cent, will soon be coming down as part of a broad move towards lower interest rates across Europe. At the same time, yields for long-dated securities may well stay relatively high due to the large volume likely to go on sale over the next two years to fund the public sector borrowing requirement. That would lead to a further flattening in the shape of the yield curve. Due to recession and the resulting reduction in inflationary pressures, the curve has, in the past year, lost much of its traditional downward-sloping character. The moribund state of the UK economy was underlined by last week's industrial trends survey by the Confederation of British Industry, which reported a big drop in business confidence since the autumn. It also showed that the extreme weakness of demand was continuing to force manufacturers to cut prices, producing inflationary pressures at the factory level. Another sign that the recovery in the UK will be slow, a factor which should put downward pressure on gilt yields over the next six months, came from the most recent figures for UK trade. The 1.1 per cent growth in import volumes, less oil and erratics, between the third and fourth quarters of 1991 followed a 1.5 per cent rise between the third and second quarters. That was after a 1.3 per cent fall in the second quarter. On one interpretation of the statistics, the slight reduction in import growth in recent months backs up the anecdotal evidence that the upturn from the recession has slipped back. It could be that the more pronounced upward blip in imports in the third quarter was largely due to factories purchasing stocks of components and other items for goods for exports, a view supported by the surprisingly high growth in export volumes in the final three months of 1991. Not including oil and erratics, exports grew in this period by 2.3 per cent compared with August to October, after a 1.4 per cent decline between the second and third quarters. In spite of deflationary conditions, a worry for gilt specialists is the volume of bonds that might be needed over the next two years to pay for increased public sector borrowing. According to Goldman Sachs, Pounds 26.2bn worth of gilts will be sold in 1992-93 by the Bank of England, nearly twice as much as this year. Although one view is that the large supply will push down prices and raise yields, others reckon the worries are overdone and that buyers will emerge for the debt at relatively high prices. Supporting this theory is the strong buying support for gilts for much of the past year. That was underscored in last week's gilt auction, when the Bank sold Pounds 1.8bn of the Treasury 9.75 per cent stock maturing in 2002 at a reasonably high price. The average accepted bid for the gilt was 102 5/32 , while the lowest was 102 3/32 . Bids amounted to Pounds 3.64bn, giving a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.02, a figure indicating relatively high demand. In December, domestic institutions bought Pounds 977m worth of gilts from the Bank, after Pounds 1.2bn in November, while buying support from overseas investors was also high. These groups purchased gilts worth Pounds 224m last month, after Pounds 83m in November, according to Bank statistics issued last week. Another problem for the gilt market might be the uncertainty due to the election, which could depress prices. However, Mr John Shepperd, an economist at Warburg Securities, is generally bullish about gilts. He notes that with inflation falling in the UK, the yield difference between 10-year gilts and the equivalent German bonds will continue to decline. The number stood at more than 200 basis points in mid-1991; it has now come down to about 170 basis points, and Mr Shepperd thinks it will fall to around 120 basis points by later this year.</p>

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Media Futures: Fujitsu plans digital challenge in US - The Japanese computer group is preparing for a head-on multimedia clash with Microsoft Fujitsu, Japan's largest computer manufacturer, is planning a multimedia initiative in the US, which could bring it into head-on competition with Microsoft, the world's biggest software house. In April next year, it plans to launch a US version of a futuristic, on-line role-playing game which it has been testing for more than seven years in Japan. Called Habitat, it creates a fantasy world on screen - a virtual city in cyberspace, as multimedia experts would describe it - populated by characters who take on the personalities of the players. There are some 10,000 regular subscribers in Japan. Japanese sociologists are already fascinated by the way people behave when allowed to adopt these electronic alter egos. Within Habitat there is a 'head shop' where players can change their heads, and a 'paint shop' where they can change their clothes. However, Habitat - which Fujitsu bought from the Lucas Arts Entertainment Company, owned by George Lucas, director of 'Star Wars' (see below) - is more than a game. It can function as an attractive, simple-to-use interface to a broad range of information and educational services. Students can send messages to each other on an electronic campus; shops and banks can be created on screen; and players can send their electronic images off on shopping trips. Tatsuzumi Furukawa, Fujitsu main board director and multimedia projects group manager, says that Habitat will be the first test of Fujitsu's multimedia capabilities outside Japan. If it proves successful, the service will be extended to Europe, beginning with the UK in 1996. A successful Habitat in the US would find itself in direct competition with Microsoft's planned Microsoft Network, an on-line information service which the software giant is expected to launch next spring, and which will feature shopping catalogues, financial services and news services. Microsoft's prices are expected to be significantly below those of existing on-line services such as America On-Line or CompuServe. It is expected to offer a simple user interface, based on Microsoft's best-selling Windows software. Much will depend on the quality of information available over the respective networks. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, has been busily signing up information providers in anticipation of the start of Microsoft Network. Fujitsu operates Japan's leading on-line business information service, Nifty-serve, in partnership with Nissho Iwai. In 1993 it had revenues of Dollars 130m (Pounds 79m) and profits before tax of about Dollars 13m. Nifty-serve has a relationship with CompuServe, of the US, but Furukawa agrees that over the next few years Fujitsu will have to form alliances with a broad range of information providers. Some will be simple commercial relationships, but others will be strategic partnerships: 'If an information provider wanted to start a new kind of service, we would be able to help,' Furukawa says. 'We have substantial experience now.' Fujitsu's venture in the US is just one indication of the importance it attaches to multimedia. It has set a target of expanding sales of multi-media-related products and services to reach 20 to 25 per cent of revenues by 1997. Currently the category accounts for only 2 to 3 per cent of the group's sales. As a leading electronics manufacturer, it already provides much of the hardware which is making multimedia possible. It supplies, for example, four out of the seven regional Bell operating companies with switches and optical equipment for asynchronous transfer mode transmission, the new technology which is expected to underpin the information superhighway. Fujitsu sees multimedia, however, as the leading edge of its translation from a predominantly hardware manufacturing group - it is best known for its IBM-compatible mainframe computers - to a services orientated business. The company is becoming involved in content, developing and marketing information, entertainment and educational materials. Last June, it established a Digital Media Group to co-ordinate these activities. The group has a core of researchers who worked on software for Fujitsu's pioneering FM-Towns multimedia personal computer (launched some six years ago) and on three-dimentional animation. The idea is to seek out and work with Japanese and overseas partners to develop and market software and programs for CD-Rom, PC on-line communications, cable TV and other media platforms. Furukawa says: 'It is something we are taking step by step. In the US there are many trials of multimedia developments such as video-on-demand. But we are concerned with how to make a business out of multimedia after the trials are over.' The company has a three-pronged approach to the market: First, there is the on-line information business, represented by Nifty-serve and Habitat. Fujitsu has a strategic alliance with Sharp, the consumer electronics company, which has sold some 400,000 personal digital assistants (hand-held computers capable of accepting handwritten instructions). The two companies are planning to link Nifty-serve to the PDA, to create a mobile on-line information service. Second, cable television. This is a novel service in Japan, and subscriber numbers are low. But Fujitsu has invested in some 23 cable television companies. It is a limited experiment; the investment in each amounts to only 15-20 per cent of the equity, but it is providing a test-bed for trials of interactive services. Third, business multimedia. Fujitsu is marketing Team Office developed by ICL, its UK subsidiary, in Japan. The software makes it possible to share documents, and for colleagues to work together using linked personal computers. Fujitsu and ICL agreed to work together on multimedia developments last year. The cultural shift was as great for ICL as for its parent. From marketing large mainframes it had to focus on the home market, education and entertainment. McKinsey, the management consultancy, worked with the company for four months to help ICL understand the dynamics of such a new market. The first fruits - kiosk systems for the retail and financial services industry - are now on trial with customers such as Argos, Woolworths and the Nationwide Building Society.</p>

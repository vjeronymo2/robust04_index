Present there were Premier of the Administration Council  Kang  Song-san and Vice-President Yi Chong-ok who are Politburo  members of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea  [WPK] and other senior party and state officials.    Kang Hyon-su, member of the C.C. [Central Committee], the  WPK, chief secretary of the Pyongyang municipal committee of the  WPK and chairman of the Pyongyang municipal people's committee,  delivered a report titled "Let us accelerate the ultimate  solution to the socialist rural question under the leadership of  the party."    He said the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, in his  historic  letter "For the ultimate solution of the rural question under  the banner of the socialist rural theses" addressed to the  National Agricultural Conference, reviewed with pride the  decisive victory won in the implementation of the socialist  rural theses and clearly indicated tasks to finally solve the  socialist rural question and ways for their fulfilment.    He stressed that the letter of the great leader is a  militant  banner of weighty historic significance in triumphantly solving  the socialist rural question and thus consolidating man-centred  socialism of our style and further exalting its might and  successfully discharging the noble duty we have assumed for the  times and history.    The reporter called for maintaining a constant upsurge in  rural construction and agricultural production through  energetic efforts for the thorough implementation of the highly  important tasks laid down in the letter.    He laid emphasis on the need to develop in depth the  ideological, cultural and technical revolutions in the  countryside in compliance with the requirements of socialist  rural construction on a new, higher stage.    "If the socialist agricultural cooperative economy is to be  consolidated and developed still further and the conversion of  cooperative property into all-people property is to be realised  smoothly without any deviations, it is essential to increase  the support of the towns to the countryside and material and  technical assistance of industry to agriculture, further enhance  the role of the county in socialist rural construction and give  full play to the advantages and vitality of the chuche-based  agricultural guidance system of our style," he said, and  continued:    "Now the imperialists and reactionaries are making desperate  efforts to isolate and stifle our Republic politically,  economically and militarily. But all the agricultural working  people should believe and follow only the great leader President  Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and become  a fortress and a shield defending the party and the leader  politically and ideologically and with their lives."    Speeches were made and a resolution was adopted at the  rally.    At the end of the rally hundreds of lorries loaded with  farming materials left for rural villages around the city.</p>

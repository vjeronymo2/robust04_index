Despite Kiev's  Objections, the CIS Receives Observer Status in the United  Nations"]    [Text] Debates at the 48th session of the UN General  Assembly, which has resumed in New York, were marked by yet  another clash between Moscow and Kiev. In the last two years  the world has managed to get used to the fact that the two  largest Slav states appear in the role of antagonists in  international forums with enviable constancy.    The discussion of the question of conferring UN observer  status on the CIS was no exception. Vladimir Khandogiy, the  Ukrainian representative, issued a hard-hitting statement that  took the Russian delegation by surprise. He resolutely objected  to the recognition of the Commonwealth as a subject of  international law and as a regional organization which could  carry out peacekeeping operations.    This position radically contradicts Russia's approach.  Moscow is insistently seeking international recognition of the  CIS, and it was mainly thanks to its efforts that the issue of  granting the Commonwealth UN observer status was included on the  agenda of the 48th session.    Replying to Khandogiy's speech, Russia's permanent  representative to the United Nations Yuriy Vorontsov stated that  Ukraine's objections are "due to its being insufficiently  informed on the character of the Commonwealth and the agreements  between its members." In his words, the treaty which is the  legal basis of the CIS' peacekeeping activity was signed between  Commonwealth members -- including Ukraine -- 20 March 1992 in  Kiev.    Despite Ukraine's peculiar position, the CIS nevertheless  received observer status, which as of today is possessed by  three regional organizations -- the European Union, the Arab  League, and the Organization of African Unity. The resolution  to this effect was adopted by the General Assembly without a  vote.    Commenting on Kiev's position, a high-ranking Russian  diplomat did not rule out that Ukraine's new hardline approach  is connected with the forthcoming elections to the republic  parliament. By going against Moscow and once more stating their  skeptical attitude to the CIS, it is possible that the Kiev  authorities are counting on attracting the votes of supporters  of Ukrainian independence -- mainly in the republic's western  oblasts.    However, Ukrainian diplomacy's New York demarche could  produce an undesirable effect for Kiev in regions with a  Russian-speaking population, first and foremost in the Crimea.  Inhabitants of the peninsula have received fresh confirmation  that the Ukrainian leadership is not seeking rapprochement with  Russia. This could fuel anti-Ukrainian sentiments and affect  the results of the poll on the status of the Crimea scheduled  for 27 March.</p>

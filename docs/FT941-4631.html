			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Clondalkin declines 18% to IPounds 10.5m Clondalkin, the Dublin-based printing and packaging company, continued to be adversely affected by 'flat demand, pressure on selling prices, low raw material prices and cost inflation' in 1993, as pre-tax profits declined 17.5 per cent from IPounds 12.8m to IPounds 10.5m, or Pounds 10.1m sterling, over the year. The group added that operating profits fell in Ireland and the mid-Atlantic region of the US, the two areas where market conditions had been weakest. Elsewhere, in the US and in the UK, profits rose. Group operating profits emerged at IPounds 11.1m (IPounds 13.3m). Turnover grew to IPounds 152.7m (IPounds 149.6m). Earnings declined to 17.52p (22.48p) per share, but the final dividend is maintained at 2.898p for an unchanged total of 4.732p.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Solidarity on collision course with coalition POLAND'S Solidarity trade union has threatened to call a general strike next week in its bid to win higher wages for teachers, health service workers and other public sector employees. The call would be accompanied by a no confidence motion in Ms Hanna Suchocka's coalition government by the Solidarity's group of deputies in parliament, according to Mr Marian Krzaklewski, the Solidarity leader. The government is based on a six-party coalition which controls 177 votes in the 460 seat Sejm, the more important chamber in parliament. The Solidarity leadership has given the government until May 18 to come up with 'satisfactory' answers to the movement's demands which the government says cannot be fulfilled, given present budget restrictions. This year's budget deficit has been set in the agreement with the International Monetary Fund at 82,000bn zloty (Pounds 3.1bn) or 5 per cent of gross domestic product and any unward revision could lead to suspension of successive tranches of Dollars 660m worth of standby credits due to run until the spring of 1994. As it is, the government will in any case be hard pressed to meet the IMF target, thanks to a recent parliamentary vote increasing pensions and forgiving housing loans extended before 1990, which threaten to put a further 20,000bn zloty onto the deficit. The root of Solidarity's rift with the government lies in the fact that its role has been largely restricted to that of a trade union since the end of communist rule. Before that, it was an all-embracing opposition movement. 'The cause of the dramatic public sector strikes. . . is the arrogance of the government and attacks on the union by representatives of the state administration,' Solidarity's National Commission said in a toughly worded statement. Some union leaders have increasingly sided with workers disillusioned with reforms which have increased inflation and unemployment but brought them few concrete rewards. Some union deputies have voted against the government in parliament. Meanwhile, workers in the south western Walbrzych region who have been striking and blockading the local government headquarters to demand effective restructuring policies suspended their protest after a promise of talks with the government due to begin today. Solidarity has fewer than 2m members but showed last December it is capable of mounting large-scale strikes when it led a three-week stoppage in coal mines. Solidarity unionists are planning a half-hour token stoppage in the industrial region of Silesia today and railway workers are considering strikes early next week.</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Wealth that's simply gross - Truth of the Matter 'MONEY IS THE root of all evil.' Wrong. What Paul wrote was: 'The love of money is the root of all evil.' ARISTOTLE had said much the same three centuries before. The Christian church has had its ecclesiastical knickers in a twist on the subject for centuries since. Only in the past 50 years have Christian academics taken up economics and attempted to bring some intellectual and moral order to the hubbub. And it is only in the past decade that anyone has had the effrontery to take Adam Smith at his word and proclaim from the rooftops that greed is a social virtue as the only plausible engine for economic growth. Odd, isn't it, that only the well-to-do really like this argument? Recently, I sat next to the assistant editor of a national newspaper who was preaching fervently this gospel of the higher selfishness. I found myself a lone voice pleading for the outworn shibboleths of Christian ethics. 'Positively Gothic]' murmured one recent and portly convert to the economic enlightenment. Well, as custodian of the finest Gothic cathedral in the land, I might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb. There are two levels of moral discourse about wealth: social and personal. Wealth, in the sense of resources for living a full life, must be good. Wealth creation is a good thing. An impoverished society deprives its members of the resources to fulfil their potential. They grow up physically, intellectually and spiritually stunted. But all societies exist in a wider social context. Wealthy communities live in or alongside poor ones. Sometimes, the contrast is grotesque. Do the former have any moral responsibility for the latter? My journalist neighbour denied it. The economic machine is driven by the visible threat of poverty as much as by the lure of wealth. Some trickle-down might occur fortuitously (huh]) but no welfare programmes, please. Leave that to the do-gooders. And the same goes for international affairs. Let the market do its own thing. The hidden hand will work for the optimum benefit for the maximum number of people. Hard cheese for the poor. Or no cheese. I passed him the Stilton. I find in myself a deep moral revulsion against that view. Of course, concern for the poor - native human compassion - is not confined to the Judaeo-Christian tradition. In Rabbinic law, bystanders are guilty if they do not intervene to prevent an injustice. It is a central religious issue. The rich have a moral obligation to the poor equivalent to the moral responsibility of parents for their own children. It is not just philanthropy, an optional extra for really nice guys. It is part of the core curriculum. Wealth, serious wealth - no, let us call it by its name, gross wealth - in the hands of a few individuals or a small class distorts the fabric of society. It gives huge, unfettered and often invisible power to people - such as Robert Maxwell - who are not accountable to anyone. It subverts the democratic process and is often above the law. The existence of gross affluence and abject poverty in the same community is outrageous morally and a symptom of a profound social malaise which affects the relationships of almost everyone. It destabilises the community and instigates violence. If I am at the beck and call of an acquisitive instinct - greed - I cannot at the same time respond to a generous urge which would rather see someone else profit than myself; or to that warm-heartedness which is interested genuinely in people as people, rather than what they are. In my experience the very wealthy often endure a kind of loneliness which is crowded but cold. Nevertheless, it seems that unequal degrees of wealth and a keen ambition to acquire it are now an inescapable pre-condition of economic growth. Even moderate wealth seems often to produce a coarsening of moral sensibility. As a parish priest, I have had access to the personal lives of some of the most impoverished of our fellow citizens, and have dined at the tables of some of the richest. Among the latter, I often feel in myself a kind of generalised moral unease. Kindly, witty and urbane, they are insulated from the pain and vulnerability of the bulk of humanity. They evince a moral numbness. The wealthy, particularly, cannot bear very much human reality. It questions the moral foundation of their personal lives. It is much more comfortable to turn greed into a virtue. I was so challenged by a visitor from the Sudan who was offered supper by his hostess, having previously been entertained to a substantial lunch. He shook his head in surprise. 'Oh, no, thank you. You see, we only eat every other day.' A vigorous, good and happy man. The writer is Dean of Salisbury</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / World Trade News: European new car sales fall faster NEW CAR sales in western Europe dropped by an estimated 20.1 per cent last month, intensifying the already steep decline experienced in the first half. The July figure showed a fall to around 914,000 from 1.14m in the same month a year earlier. It was the seventh month in succession that sales have dropped. In the first seven months of the year new car sales have gone down by an estimated 17.7 per cent to 7m from 8.5m in the corresponding a period a year ago, according to provisional industry estimates. The decline has been led by a serious contraction in sales in Germany and Italy, the two largest car markets in Europe. The rate of decline accelerated in both markets in July, as German new car sales fell by an estimated 24.5 per cent and sales in Italy dropped by around 31 per cent. Overall sales last month were lower than they were a year ago in 14 of 17 markets across Europe, with modest rises only in Switzerland, Norway and the UK, where sales in July rose by 7 per cent. Western Europe is suffering its steepest fall in demand for new cars for more than a decade, with sales in the first seven months dramatically lower than a year ago in 16 of 17 markets. The only significant gain has come in Britain where there has been a rise of 9.1 per cent, albeit from a very low level. In Germany, Europe's biggest single market, sales fell by an estimated 20.7 per cent in the first seven months to 2.01m. Among the big six volume carmakers, the Fiat group of Italy, which includes Alfa Romeo and Lancia, has suffered the steepest decline, with a fall of around 25.5 per cent in its sales in the first seven months. Rover, the British Aerospace subsidiary, is the only significant carmaker in Europe to have raised its sales despite the market decline.

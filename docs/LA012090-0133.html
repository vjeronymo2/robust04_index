			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CLARIFICATION  </P> <P> An index item Friday indicated incorrectly that Pacific Symphony musicians have  not been paid for performances with the Master Chorale of Orange County. In  fact, the musicians have been paid. The chorale owes the money to symphony  management.  </P></p>

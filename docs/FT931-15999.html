			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: EFM pays Pounds 2.5m for 10 Target Life unit trusts EDINBURGH FUND Managers is acquiring the 10 unit trusts of Target Life Assurance Company. The move is a further sign of consolidation in the retail investment fund industry. EFM is paying Pounds 2.5m cash, which is a little more than 2.25 per cent of the Pounds 110m in funds under management in the unit trusts. EFM expects the transaction to increase its earnings per share. The move gives EFM Pounds 320m in unit trusts under management and approximately 60,000 unit holders and make it the UK's 20th largest unit trust manager in terms of clients. Annual unit trust fund management fees are about 1 per cent of funds under management and EFM could recoup its costs in under three years, industry analysts said. EFM is buying the share capital of Target Trust Managers but will not be employing any of the current staff or management of the company.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A few examples of such efforts include the American Public Welfare Association's policy on  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Commitment to Change,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the ``decategorization of funding'' and collaborative planning efforts in a number of States, the Children's Trust Funds and Children's Cabinets, and support for demonstrations of improved planning and child welfare service delivery from the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, the Annie E. Casey Foundation, and the Kellogg Foundation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today, there are a variety of models of family preservation providing services to families at risk or in crisis. These models differ in level of intensity, services approaches, duration of services, and entrance parameters. Specific program models include Homebuilders, the Families First programs, Family Services America programs, and Maryland's Intensive Family Services program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, today, there are hundreds of community-based family support programs nationwide including center-based models (family resource centers); school-based models; home-based models, including home visiting programs; and models that combine several approaches, such as Parents and Teachers, the Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters (HIPPY), and the Healthy Families America initiative. The Family Services America programs are considered both family preservation and family support.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many Indian tribes and tribal organizations also have developed and implemented family-centered or family-based services, including family preservation and family support programs. Tribal programs may be center-based, home-based (include home visiting), or contain elements of both. Most programs seek to build on family strengths and use traditional and cultural activities as a part of their services approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several Federal programs or initiatives also have focused on prevention, family-centered practice, and a community-based approach. Some examples include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Head Start Bureau's Family Services and Family Support Projects, and Parent and Child Centers;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The National Comprehensive Child Development Program demonstration;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect's State community-based prevention grants associated with Children's Trust Funds;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The National Family Support Resource Center and the National Family-Based Services Resource Center (beginning in 1994, it will be known as the National Family-Centered Practice Resource Center) funded by the Children's Bureau;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Family and Youth Services Bureau's Family Resource and Support program;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Public Health Services' (PHS) ``Healthy Start'' program;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Office of Community Services' Family Support Centers (homeless families demonstration);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Family Self-Sufficiency demonstration program; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The PHS Child and Adolescent Services System Program (CASSP), a planning model for coordinated mental health services for children now implemented in all States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. ACF Implementation of the Family Preservation and Support Services Legislation: Lessons Learned From the Field  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) recognized that for the new program to be effective, we needed to engage in a variety of learning activities that would support the development of useful guidance and appropriate Federal regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As one part of our implementation of this new legislation, we convened a series of focus groups in both the Central and Regional Offices with family support and family preservation program directors, practitioners, and experts; State, county, and city child welfare administrators; State and local agencies with experience in providing such services; representatives of Indian tribes and regional and national Tribal organizations; national advocacy, interest group, and professional organizations; representatives of national organizations representing Governors, State legislators, and counties; and parents, foster parents, and consumers of child welfare services. In addition, we met with or received written materials and recommendations from a number of other experts and practitioners in the field.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The suggestions, guidance, and information we received through this process have been invaluable to us in the development of the Program Instructions to States and Indian tribes on applying for FY 1994 funds (ACYF&hyph;PI&hyph;94&hyph;01, January 18, 1994, and ACYF PI&hyph;94&hyph;04, January 18, 1994) and this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM): <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DERIVATIVES markets provided the driving force behind the rise in the FT-SE 100 Index to a new closing peak yesterday, but appeared to lose heart towards the end of the day, writes Terry Byland. The March contract on the FT-SE Index set the pace, opening with a premium of around 10 points against the cash market, a strong performance compared with a discount of around 4 points on the fair value calculation which allows for carrying costs and dividend flows on the basket of Footsie stocks making up the contract. A healthy arbitrage opportunity between futures and cash was seized by some UK houses. However, futures traders said that business in their market was not particularly heavy - the March contract finally traded 2,884 contracts, an unimpressive total. The contract held its premium at the official close when persistent selling by a Scandinavian bank was counteracted by demand from locals, or independent traders. After the offical close, however, the contract slipped back further from the day's peak to show little change from the final reading on the FT-SE Index itself. Traded options business fell to 18,536 bargains from nearly 30,000 on Friday, with the FT-SE trading only 7,093 and the Euro FT-SE 1,017. Asda headed the individual stocks list with 1,049 lots.</p>

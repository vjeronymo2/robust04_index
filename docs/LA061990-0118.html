			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE AND MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> GERSTLER PREMIERE ON FINAL GENERATOR EIGHT PROGRAM  </P> <P> Context is everything -- at least that seems to sum up the final Generator  Eight program Sunday, concluding the dance festival at the Los Angeles Theatre  Center.  </P> <P> Otherwise, how could a piece that had previously smacked of a crank-'em-out  mentality -- Sarah Elgart's "Sleepless" -- suddenly become the heavyweight of  this evening?  </P> <P> Answer: by not being placed on the same bill with its look-alikes and by  landing alongside several very thin, very improvisatory items.  </P> <P> The touted premiere of the program, Tina Gerstler's "Onomatopoeia," boasted  neither cleverness, nor craftsmanship, nor depth, nor wit, and gave away its  terminal cuteness at the outset: Five women stroll onstage, warm up as for a  class and chat with a trio of musicians already in position.  </P> <P> Then, against what is basically a conga solo, courtesy of Brad Dutz, the  dancers go through their paces -- sprinting, flinging, rolling and sliding --  in what now seems the accepted vocabulary of postmodern dance. Appropriating a  language without addressing syntax or meaning, however, does not bode well.  </P> <P> And in trying to puzzle out the value of Gerstler's contribution -- after all,  LATC does provide a superior stage opportunity where audiences expect full  professionalism -- this viewer could find none.  </P> <P> As for her choice of title, well, it was consistently lame. There were nominal  attempts at representing the instrumental sounds with apt movements -- a gourd  glissando, for instance, elicited a ratchety motion. A program note offered, by  way of supposed explanation, the following: "sizzle, slither, sputter, slam,  pant, drag, patter, zig-zag, barf, whine."  </P> <P> By contrast, "Sleepless" had elements of interest. With its pajama-clad dancers  cavorting in a densely wild nightmare against the cosmic musings of narrator  Brian Brophy, at least there was an idea to grab onto.  </P> <P> The agenda also included tapper Fred Strickler and Shok-T's "Inverted  Carnival."

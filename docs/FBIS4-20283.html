			<p>BFN     [Text] KKE [Greek Communist Party] Secretary General Aleka  Papariga returned from her official visit to Cyprus, where she  met with Cypriot President Glavkos Kliridhis and Cypriot party  leaders.    In a statement issued on the Cyprus issue, Mrs. Papariga  maintained that the United States, Britain, and Turkey are not  interested in a specific way out of the problem. She noted: It  is more to their benefit that Cyprus remain as it is, with a  sort of a de facto partition, so they can intervene for their  own interests in the region. Mrs. Papariga stressed that what  we need in Greece today is pressure on the government to change  its direction on the Cyprus issue.    Commenting on Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's meetings  in  the United States on the Cyprus issue, Mrs. Papariga said:  Alas, if we stay with President Clinton's assurances,  particularly when we know his more general [words indistinct]  role in the Balkans.</p>

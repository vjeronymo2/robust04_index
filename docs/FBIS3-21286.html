			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Algeria--Toward Civil War"] </F>   [Excerpts] Eventually, as was to be expected, following  the display rigged up in the name of "a conference for national  consensus" the militarists usurped power by appointing the  Algerian defense minister as the country's president. This  proves that no political solution remains for the Algerian  crisis.    Even though the military have long been the actual rulers  behind the scenes in Algeria and are well aware of the situation  in their society and of their impotence to quell the Islamic  movement, they were forced to take this risk for their  self-perpetuation in the crisis-ridden Algerian society.    It is interesting to note that the Algerian politicians were  not prepared, as wisdom dictated, to accept any risks in order  not to become toys in the hands of the military. It is evident  that the military's success or failure will decide the future  destiny of Algeria, and already the signs of defeat are obvious!    The Western countries--including France--have not welcomed  the current situation and the lack of legitimacy at home, which  is not even in conformity with the 1989 Algerian Constitution.  This certainly does not bode well for the militarists' turn at  the helm of government for the next three years. In order to  keep their position they will be forced to resort to a military  dictatorship and complete repression, and this will lead Algeria  toward a full-fledged civil war in which the Muslims will enjoy  political legitimacy and popular backing. [passage omitted]    In view of the continuing political crisis, which has been  exacerbated by the concomitant economic crisis stemming from a  reduction of oil prices, the military's usurpation of power in  Algeria can be construed as "political suicide." Perhaps, since  they do not believe in reconciliation with the Islamic movement  and cannot accept peaceful coexistence with them, they are  prepared to embark on this suicide! If the militarists had been  on the side of the people, and had yielded to the popular will,  they would not have darkened their own future as well as that of  Algeria.</p>

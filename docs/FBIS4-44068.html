			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [George Jones, Christopher Lockwood report: "Major Proposes </F> EC War on Crime"]    [Text] Corfu--A Europe-wide crusade against drugs,  international crime and fraud was urged by Mr John Major at  yesterday's opening session of the EC summit.    He called on fellow European leaders to approve a five-point  plan to combat crime within the EC and foreshadowed plans for a  new drive against drugs in British schools this autumn. It  would be aimed at changing youth culture and reducing the  availability and acceptability of drugs.    Mr Major said tackling rising crime would be one way in  which  the EC could demonstrate that it was addressing the issues which  affected its citizens. He said the low turn-out in the  elections to the European Parliament earlier this month had  shown there was widespread apathy towards the EC.    "People aren't at the roadside cheering it on. Many don't  see it as being relevant in their lives. We must bring European  policies closer to the people."    Quoting what he described as "sobering statistIcs," Mr Major  said that enough cocaine had been seized in the EC so far this  year to provide 24 million individual doses. The drugs were  worth an estimated 840 billion pounds.    He said the British Government would be publishing a new  national drugs strategy in the autumn. One of its main  objectives would be to counter drug abuse in schools and look at  the link between drug use and crime.    Europe needed a clear action plan across the Community to  tackle drug trafficking and protect young people.    It must also combat fraud against the EC, which amounted to  robbing the taxpayers of huge sums. A recent investigation had  uncovered fraudulent claims of more than 65 million pounds for  nonexistent stocks of wheat. All 12 EC countries needed  effective national laws against fraud, which should be made  "criminal, imprisonable and extraditable."    Mr Major said the summit should agree to:    All EC countries ratifying by October a convention setting  up  Europol, the basis of a Europe-wide police force dealing with  drugs, organised crime and fraud. It would be based in The  Hague.    Europol's powers should be wide, to include an attack on  organised crime.    The countries of central and eastern Europe should be  involved in joint measures against crime.    The German government, which takes over the EC presidency on  July 1, should call a conference on drugs and organised crime.    The EC should reach agreement on national criminal laws  against fraud by the end of this year.    Chancellor Helmut Kohl assured Mr Major that one of the  priorities of the German presidency would be combating drugs.    Earlier, the EC leaders and Mr Boris Yeltsin signed a  partnership and co-operation agreement paving the way for closer  trading links between Russia and the Community.    This, the first such deal Russia has signed with any of its  trading partners, came two days after it agreed to a Partnership  for Peace deal with NATO.    Sir Leon Brittan, the EC Trade Commissioner, described the  latest agreement as a "quantum leap" in Russia's relationship  with Europe.    Leaders of the four countries which have agreed to join the  EC next year -- Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway -- signed  the formal Instrument of Accession, which admits them to the  Community. Austria has endorsed that decision in a referendum,  but the other three still have to win the backing of their  people.</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The family of a Redding man convicted of murdering his wife is posting a  $10,000 reward for information that will clear him or lead to another suspect.  Members of Dale Crawford's family said they would announce the offer in an  advertisement in a local newspaper and on flyers in public places where the  victim reportedly spent her last hours. Crawford's court-appointed attorney,  Jack Suter, has filed a motion for a new trial, claiming among other things  that newly discovered evidence will show that a key prosecution witness  committed perjury. Crawford, a 33-year-old sawmill worker, was convicted in  January of beating his wife, Theresa, to death last year. The alleged murder  weapon, a baseball bat, and the bedspread allegedly used to wrap her body have  never been found.  </P></p>

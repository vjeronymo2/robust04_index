			<p>BFN     [Text] The Supreme Court of Pakistan has by a majority vote  held that on the revival of the Provincial Assembly of the NWFP  [North-West Frontier Province] on the lapse of the proclamation  issued by the president, the chief minister and his cabinet will  stand revived.    The court clarified that it would be open to the governor to  refix the date and time in accordance with Article 130 (5) of  the Constitution, requiring the chief minister to obtain a vote  of confidence from the assembly.    The two dissenting judges were of the view that the petition  [by the former chief minister] was not maintainable and would  therefore stand dismissed.</p>

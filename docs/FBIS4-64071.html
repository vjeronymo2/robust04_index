			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Gleb Cherkasov report under the "Hypotheses" rubric: </F> "Gennadiy Zyuganov Is Choosing A Future For Russia. Rutskoy And  Zhirinovskiy May Disagree With Him"]    [Text] Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party of  the Russian Federation [CPRF], while meeting with the public in  Samara, divulged his views on what he sees as the most likely  scenarios of sociopolitical developments in Russia. According  to Comrade Zyuganov, at this stage there are three.    According to the first scenario, the "merger" between the  authorities and the criminal structures will continue. Gennadiy  Zyuganov pointed out that this development of events is  eliciting extreme concern among both Russian and foreign  politicians. The second option, which envisions "a social  explosion accompanied by mass protests of badly-off groups  driven to despair," does not suit the CPRF leader, either,  because, in his view, the current "top authorities" will  definitely try to shift all the blame on to mid- level local  leaders, thanks to whom, Comrade Zyuganov believes, Russia still  "holds."    The CPRF leader sees the best possible scenario as the  coming  to power of patriotic forces. Gennadiy Zyuganov pointed out  that the opposition forces would like to start work on the  restoration of the USSR (apparently, not in the capacity of  non-government organizations) as early as by the 50th  anniversary of victory in the Great Patriotic War. Comrade  Zyuganov said that the congress of the "Accord for Russia"  movement on 28 May will make a number of decisions that will  help form a formidable and well-structured opposition.    At the same time, the movement's relations with two other  large opposition associations -- the "State" ["Derzhava"]  movement being set up by Aleksandr Rutskoy and Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] -- are  still uncertain. Presently they disagree at least on one thing.  So, according to Gennadiy Zyuganov, "the presidency, as it  stands now, is detrimental to the country." However, any  attempts to weaken the presidency will evidently draw a  disapproving reaction from Vladimir Zhirinovskiy.    As for Aleksandr Rutskoy's stance, the Russian Social  Democratic People's Party leader said recently that he "somewhat  mistrusts the CPRF" because of its stance both in August 1991  and in October 1993. Moreover, Mr. Rutskoy is also unlikely to  be very enthusiastic about the abolition of the presidency or  any considerable restriction of his powers.</p>

According to  Qol Yisra'el's diplomatic correspondent, this was decided last  night in a meeting between Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign  Minister Peres. More from reporter Dick Winter:    [Begin recording] [Winter] [passage omitted] The prime  minister is not playing the PLO's game. Last night, in his  meeting with the Arab Israeli Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, who has been  described by Palestinian watchers as the PLO's ambassador to  Israel, Prime Minister Rabin rejected the PLO's proposal to hold  the talks today without 'Arafat being present.    Rabin is keeping Israel's next moves close to the chest. In  a speech last night welcoming Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus  to Israel, the prime minister repeated the stand he has been  taking for the last month:    [Rabin] Mr. Prime Minister, in our quest for peace we have  learned that we must stand our ground on matters of life and  death, to guarantee our security, and not to run after false  solutions. For us, peace without security is not peace. We are  mindful of lessons from your distant and not so distant past.  One of them is taken from your tragic history: the agreement  which abandoned your country to the destructive jaws of the Nazi  regime. We have learned to rely only on ourselves.    [Winter] This morning, Prime Minister Rabin will again meet  with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, as well as the entire  Israeli delegation and with senior members of the defense  establishment, to decide on Israel's next move.

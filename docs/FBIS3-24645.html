			<p>SUMMARY                                    With the specter of economic sanctions over the nuclear issue  looming larger, Pyongyang media have sharpened their rhetoric  against Washington.  At the same time, Pyongyang radio aired a  leadership view that indicated a strong preference for a  negotiated settlement, a possible sign that pragmatists within  the North Korean leadership may be counseling a less  confrontational approach to the nuclear issue.                                     END SUMMARY      Following last week's harshly worded Foreign Ministry spokesman's  statement that accused Washington of bad faith, Pyongyang raised  its confrontational rhetoric another notch.  A 3 February  followup commentary in the party paper Nodong Sinmun seemed to go  beyond the Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement by hinting at  possible military confrontation and by warning that North Korean  verbal threats should be taken seriously (Pyongyang radio, 3  February).  Sounding a belligerent note, the commentary declared  that continued U.S. "pressure" on the DPRK will result ultimately  in North Korea taking "concrete action."  The commentary went on  to declare that North Koreans are "completely prepared  politically, ideologically, militarily, and materially to cope  with any unexpected situation," and warned that "those who act  rashly and and recklessly will face only shameful defeat."  It  cautioned, "What we say is not empty words.  We do not like to  issue idle talk."     Assessment of Talks     In sharp contrast to the belligerence  apparent in both the 31 January Foreign Ministry spokesman's  statement and the 3 February commentary, Pyongyang radio on 4  February reported remarks by a high North Korean official that  accentuated the positive aspect of bilateral talks with  Washington on the nuclear issue.  At a 1 February Moscow press  conference held in support of the Foreign Ministry spokesman's  statement, according to the radio, DPRK Ambassador to Russia Son  Song-pil reiterated the now standard accusation that Washington  is not interested in a negotiated settlement, but stopped short  of following the line set in the earlier spokesman's statement  and depicted bilateral negotiations as a "delaying tactic" on the  part of the United States.  On the contrary, he cited the DPRK-  U.S. joint statement, issued at the first round of high-level  bilateral talks last June, and unspecified "certain progress" he  claimed was achieved at the second round in July, as positive  accomplishments.  The tenor of Son's assessment was in sharp  contrast to the 31 January spokesman's statement, which dismissed  the DPRK-U.S. talks as having been used by Washington merely to  "buy time" to prepare for "crushing" North Korea.  Moreover, the  comments by Son, who in the 1980's headed the North Korean Red  Cross and was instrumental in bringing about inter-Korean  exchanges of family visits and art troupes, suggested that a  peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue is still within reach.  While chiding Washington for allegedly leading the talks to a  potential "rupture," he stated that this had happened at a  "decisive moment when a bright vista for a complete resolution of  the nuclear issue . . . is being opened up," an upbeat assessment  of the talks Pyongyang had not used in recent weeks.     Implications     Pyongyang's publicity for Ambassador Son's press  conference appears part of its carefully calibrated media  campaign to signal its preference for a peaceful settlement of  the nuclear issue, its heightened rhetoric notwithstanding.  Son's upbeat portrayal of DPRK-U.S. nuclear negotiations seems  likely to represent views of pragmatists within the North Korean  leadership who are pressing for amelioration of Pyongyang's  current international isolation as a means to preserve the  regime.

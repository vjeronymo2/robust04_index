Economic leaders have voiced their  strong dissatisfaction.    Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic  Organizations of Japan; Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan  Chamber of Commerce and Industry; and Osamu Uno, chairman of the  Kansai Economic Federation each said: "This apparently runs  counter to the spirit of GATT."    Masaru Hayami, chairman of Japan Association of Corporate  Executives, said: "This runs counter to the spirit of free  trade."    Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of  Employers' Association, said the leaders also expressed concern  that such action "will be dangerous to relations between Japan  and the United States," and noted the need to quickly improve  relations between the two.    As far as countermeasures are concerned, Mr. Hiraiwa said  some economic leaders hoped the United States "will take action  cool-headedly.    Mr. Nagano said others stressed the need for Japan to work  out concrete measures to reduce its trade surplus, saying:  "Japan should throw the ball back to the United States soon."    Mr. Hiraiwa stressed: "Japan needs to expand domestic demand  and implement clear and quick action on deregulation and  promoting market opening."    Mr. Hayami said: "Japan's efforts must address two issues:  First reducing the current account surplus, second narrowing the  disparity between domestic and overseas prices." He called on  the government to promote such measures as a target for reducing  the current account surplus which is linked to the gross  domestic product (GDP).    There was also the feeling that private companies should try  to improve relations with the United States.    Mr. Inaba said one of the suggestions was for "Japan and the  United States to hold industry-to-industry consultations in  controversial areas of trade.    Mr. Hayami said others saw the need for the private sector  to  make additional efforts to voluntarily increase imports through  international procurement and improved distribution and  transaction practices."    Mr. Uno said that leaders were critical, however, of  attempts  to set numerical targets in the microeconomy, saying: "Methods  like managed trade should be eliminated."</p>

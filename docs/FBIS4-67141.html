			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Bolivian Labor Federation [COB] and the  government reached agreement before dawn today. The only issue  pending is the approval by the COB plenum meeting of the  agreement sometime this morning.    This means roadblocks will be lifted. This agreement must  still be approved by the COB, the top-ranking Bolivian union  central. We hope this decision will be made by noon today.  Nevertheless, the final agreement was signed before dawn today.  We will be confirming this report carried by the FIDES and  JHATA news agencies. The following is a report by Nicolas [not  further identified]:    [Nicholas] COB-government negotiations continue despite  several stumbling blocks in solving the workers' demands and  thus end the social conflict. At 1930 yesterday, negotiations  were suspended and a possible rupture seemed imminent following  criticism by the executive branch against Coca Farmers leader  Evo Morales [as heard] who said:    [Begin Morales recording] However, [words indistinct] when  peasants are blocking roads, and workers are fasting and on the  streets protesting against the government [words indistinct] on  their day, 1 of May, the president was on vacation. This is all  very fine, but he should have been heeding the problems of the  working class on 1 May, Labor Day [passage indistinct] [end  recording]    This term annoyed the executive branch very much. Government  Minister German Quiroga stated that if Evo Morales did not  withdraw his statement negotiations would be suspended. This  prompted a reaction from labor leaders like Mine Workers Union  leader Edgar Ramirez who said it was another way by the  government to continue delaying negotiations.    [Begin Ramirez recording] The government has all along tried  to win more time to surely adopt some measures. In the middle  of an agenda on mining issues, the government suddenly asked  Comrade Evo Morales to withdraw a statement he made yesterday.  [end recording]    In view of this, the COB plenum summoned for 1500 yesterday  was suspended until 0900 today.    As time passed, amid some confusion, the COB and Evo Morales  sent a letter to the executive branch in which the coca farmers  leader excuses himself and explains his statement. [passage  omitted]    The letter was handed to the executive branch. In view of an  almost unofficial excuse, the COB and the government resumed  negotiations at 1930 to define some pending issues including the  approval by coca farmers of the establishment of a ministerial  committee on coca industrialization. [passage omitted]    It is expected the COB plenum meeting will solve the social  conflict unleashed three weeks ago.    [Studio announcer] Here is a report by Jaime Murillo with  Peasant Leader Felix Santos. The roadblocks must be lifted  gradually.    [Murillo] COB leaders and government officials before dawn  today signed some important documents. This means that the  social problem currently affecting the country is about to be  solved. I will now speak by phone with Felix Santos, a  high-ranking leader of the National Confederation of Bolivian  Peasant Workers [CNTCB]. He will give us a more detailed  report. Good morning.    [Santos] Good morning to all Radio Fides listeners. We want  to explain what is happening to all our comrades and to all  those who are blocking roads.    Today at 0416 we solved all the issues raised by (each  member  of) the confederation. In view of this, different CNTCB  commissions have been dispatched to Chapare, Potosi, Chuquisaca,  and Santa Cruz. They will be arriving at about 1030 today.  These commissions have been instructed to inform the local  CNTCB boards so that they may decide (whether or not to lift)  roadblocks. A solution will be achieved possibly by noon today.  This was decided in this last-minute meeting between the COB,  the government and the CNTCB. Agreement was reached during this  meeting. However, until this decision is approved we will  continue the roadblocks. According to reports I have, we will  be in permanent contact with the grassroots to explain this  agreement. The grassroots will be contacted to explain this  agreement and the conflict will be solved. [passage omitted]    [Murillo] You have said the CNTCB executive board met after  signing an agreement with the government. Does this mean the  peasants support the agreement and the roadblocks will be lifted  as of noon today?    [Santos] This will be done after we have contacted our  grassroots. We have signed an agreement among coca producers  and another understanding on the Potosi issue. [passage omitted]    Once the grassroots have discussed these agreements, they  will inform their decision to COB by noon. Meanwhile, the  roadblocks continue.    [Murillo] Have you discussed the deaths of some peasants  with  the government?    [Santos] Yes, a high-level commission has been established  to  investigate these killing and its members will be going to the  sites later today. The commission comprises representatives  from the Chamber of Deputies constitutional committee,  legislators, human rights organizations, [words indistinct], the  COB, the government minister and the CNTCB. This commission  will go to Potosi to investigate. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATER BOARD EXPECTED TO ORDER CLOSING OF TOXIC DUMP FACING $6.2-MILLION FINE  </P> <P> The state Regional Water Quality Control Board is expected to approve a  proposal today that will shut down the landfills at Casmalia Resources, one of  two toxic waste dumps in Southern California.  </P> <P> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently had ordered Casmalia to close  most operations by Oct. 28 and proposed a $6.2-million fine against the dump  for accepting more waste than it was authorized to handle. EPA officials say  that the landfill's owners could appeal both the fine and the closure order and  stay open long beyond the mandated closing date.  </P> <P> But the proposal before the state water board to prohibit the site from  accepting regular toxic waste shipments after Nov. 26 cannot be appealed. Water  board officials say they expect the proposal to be passed, largely because  legislation mandates that the dump be closed.  </P> <P> In 1984, the Legislature ordered that toxic landfills that did not meet  stricter new standards would be effectively prohibited from accepting toxic  materials in five years. Next month, Casmalia's five years are up.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara County officials have been critical of the water board for  waiting until the last day of the five-year period to take action.  </P> <P> "They've waited until the 12th chime of the clock before doing anything," said  Mary Ann Scott, a hazardous waste specialist for the county. "This should have  been looked at years ago, especially considering the history of alleged health  violations as a result of the dump."  </P> <P> While the four landfills at Casmalia will soon be shut down, this does not mean  that Casmalia Resources is out of business. The EPA has announced a  controversial decision to grant draft permits for two new toxic landfills at  the site. The owners of the dump have applied to build two large landfills and  five "evaporation" ponds to treat contaminated ground water and other toxic  liquids. But their proposal must first complete the lengthy local, state and  federal approval process.  </P> <P> And after Nov. 26, the water board will still allow the dump to accept about 20  truckloads of waste a month for the specific purpose of drying up seepage under  the landfills. The water board will give Casmalia one year to complete this  process and then will not allow any more waste to be brought to the site. The  county and Casmalia now are involved in litigation over this controversial  cleanup method.  </P> <P> The water board waited until now to order the closure of Casmalia because  "coordinating all the closure requirements" is a time-consuming process, said  Eric Gobler, a senior engineer for the water board.  </P> <P> "I sympathize with some of the frustration," he said. "But people should also  realize there's only a few places in the state to dispose of hazardous waste.  If we closed all those areas, this state would be in a world of hurt." The only  other toxic dump in Southern California is at Kettleman City in Kings County.  </P> <P> The water board also was under criticism earlier this year for fining Casmalia  only $130,000 for contaminating ground water outside the boundaries of the  dump. The board had the authority to fine the owners of the dump up to $1.45  million.  </P> <P> Residents of the small town of Casmalia, about 70 miles north of Santa Barbara,  claim there have been extensive health problems in the community because of the  dump. Many say they are outraged that the dump has received draft permits for  more landfills and plan to turn out in force when the EPA holds a public  hearing Nov. 8 in Santa Maria on the issue.  </P> <P> "The government gives them a $6-million fine and at the same time gives them  the permit to expand the dump. What a joke," said Nick Irmiter, a longtime  Casmalia resident. "After all the medical problems we've had and all the  violations at the dump . . . the whole thing is criminal."  </P> <P> But EPA spokesman Al Zemsky said the proposed $6.2-million fine and the permit  for Casmalia's expansion "are unrelated." Casmalia applied for the permit and  the EPA is "obligated by law to accept the application, regardless of the  history of the facility," he said.  </P> <P> The fine, subject to revision depending on further information about Casmalia's  profits, was the largest ever imposed under federal toxic waste disposal laws.  The EPA charged that Casmalia violated the law by accepting too much waste and  improperly expanding its landfills. Casmalia has until the end of the month to  respond to the proposed penalty.  </P> <P> Officials at Casmalia Resources did not return numerous phone messages left at  their Montecito headquarters.  </P> <P> Casmalia officials had long maintained that the landfill was one of the safest  in the country because an "impermeable" natural clay vault prevented  contamination of ground water.  </P> <P> But in the last year, ground water contamination has been detected in four  areas outside the boundaries of the dump. Many residents now fear that even if  local or state authorities block Casmalia from building new landfills, the  existing contamination will continue to plague the area.  </P> <P> "Years after the dump is closed, the contamination's going to be causing  serious problems," said Hugh Hanna, a member of Casmalia Community Advisory  Committee. "If this contamination starts seeping into the water basin you're  going to see massive health problems."  </P> <P> But water board officials said they do not believe off-site contamination will  seep into the area's water basin because water beneath the site is flowing to  the south, away from the area's drinking water supplies.  </P> <P> The town of Casmalia has a population of only 175, but since 1982, 15 residents  have died, three have contracted rare blood diseases and there have been three  stillborn births and five miscarriages, according to Kenneth McCalip, principal  of Casmalia School and unofficial toxic waste spokesman for the town.  </P> <P> A recent county-commissioned medical study conducted by nine doctors could not  definitively link the serious health problems among residents to the dump. But  the study concluded that the dump could pose long-term health hazards to  residents, and five of the nine doctors endorsed closure of the dump.  </P> <P> "While the commission could not confirm an imminent . . . substantial  endangerment to health, that by no means implies a clean bill of health for  operation of the facility," the report said. "The major adverse effects might  not manifest themselves for decades."  </P> <P> Residents say the commission did not have access to their medical records so it  could not accurately assess the health problems caused by the dump. A number of  residents have filed a class-action lawsuit against Casmalia Resources, the  state and county, and they have been advised by their attorneys not to turn  over medical records.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Casmalia Resources, one of two toxic waste dumps in Southern California, opened  in 1972. The dump has been beset by controversy for years, and many residents  of the nearby town claim they have suffered serious health problems because of  the facility. The dump will soon be prohibited from accepting regular shipments  of toxic waste, state officials say. But Casmalia already has applied for  permits to open new landfills.  </P></p>

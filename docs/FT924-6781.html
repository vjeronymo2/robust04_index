			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: Pensions group offers guidance on derivatives THE Pensions Research Accountants Group (Prag), an association of 200 UK pension fund practitioners, has published a document on the use of futures and options by pension funds which provides guidance for trustees, investment and pension fund managers on how best to meet reporting, control and performance measurement demands. Prag has built on work by the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe) and Mercer Fraser, the actuarial firm, which published a similar report in January. But the Prag report is broader, suggesting how trustees should approach derivative products and an approach to reporting and accounting. Since the 1990 Finance Act removed uncertainty over the tax position by exempting approved pension schemes from tax on income and gains, distrust of derivatives among trustees has been perhaps the main barrier to growth in their use of them. The report focuses on strategies and risks to be considered by trustees and ways of constraining investment managers. Prag supports Liffe's view on reporting futures on an 'associated economic exposure' basis - looking at the total exposure of a particular position, rather than just taking account of the initial margin payment. But the valuation of options is more complicated, since accurate reporting requires technical calculations of the relationship between cash prices and option prices. The report suggests funds should account for premiums paid and received, and should mark option prices to market, even though this does not reflect real exposure. 'In an ideal world, we would go further,' said Mr Glyn Peat, chairman of the futures and options working party.

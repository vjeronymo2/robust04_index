			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The long-awaited peace plan aimed at restoring  normality to the violence-wrecked East Rand townships has  finally been announced. The peace initiative was devised by  State President F.W. de Klerk and ANC [African National  Congress] leader Nelson Mandela in conjunction with the  Transitional Executive Council. [passage omitted]    But the peace plan already seems to have hit a snag. In his  statement Mr. de Klerk said discussions between himself and IFP  [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader, Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, had  secured the IFP's involvement in the peace plan. But in a  strongly-worded statement the IFP has rejected the initiative.  It has described the withdrawal of the Internal Stability Units  as a treacherous betrayal of government undertakings.</p>

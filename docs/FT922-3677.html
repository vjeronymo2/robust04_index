			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / International Company News: Aetna to sell reinsurance offshoot in Dollars 1.4bn LBO AETNA Life &amp; Casualty, one of the largest US composite insurance companies, is selling its reinsurance subsidiary to a buy-out vehicle for about Dollars 1.4bn. The deal still requires regulatory approvals. If these are forthcoming, the sale will represent a rare leveraged transaction in the US insurance industry. It would also be one of the largest deals for months in the dormant leveraged buy-out (LBO) market. The buy-out company, called American Re-Insurance, has been formed by Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts, the buy-out specialists, and the reinsurance subsidiary's management. Aetna first disclosed that it was talking to KKR about a buy-out in mid-April. Speculation on the price-tag had centred around Dollars 1.4bn. Aetna will get Dollars 1.21bn in cash at the closing date and up to Dollars 20m more in December. Aetna also receives Dollars 100m principal in subordinated notes issued by American Re-Insurance, and Dollars 70m in 14 per cent pay-in-kind preferred stock. Aetna will keep most of American Re-Insurance's UK-based operations, with a book value of Dollars 30m, and take about Dollars 30m of ordinary shares in the buy-out company. The deal will be financed by a mixture of equity, bank facilities and publicly-traded debt securities. KKR said commitment letters had been received from Chase Manhattan, Continental Bank and Westpac for senior bank borrowings of Dollars 650m, and that Dollars 350m of debt securities would be sold by Merrill Lynch. Aetna bought the reinsurance company for Dollars 389m in 1979 and carries it on its books at Dollars 740m. Assets of American Re-Insurance at end-December were Dollars 3.8bn, and 1991 profits totalled Dollars 133m. The sale follows a string of restructurings and asset sales by large US insurers, attempting to bolster reserves and improve profits.</p>

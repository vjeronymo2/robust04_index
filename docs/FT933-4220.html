			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (3): Intense international battle looms - Falling sales and excess capacity mean that producers must take drastic measures in the race to regain global competitiveness / Europe EUROPE has become the battleground of the world motor industry in the 1990s. As demand for cars has nosedived across the continent, the failure of some European carmakers to put their houses in order during the recent years of strong sales has become glaringly apparent. The race to regain global competitiveness is intense - the frontiers of the European car market will be thrown fully open to Japanese import competition by the end of the decade. Japanese carmakers are already establishing a growing local production presence in Europe. Large parts of the European industry have been forced into short-time working. The European car industry's workforce is being drastically pruned. Components suppliers are being squeezed harshly to cut their prices. As overcapacity grows, companies are being forced to rationalise and restructure. Ford of Europe, once the Ford group's main profit generating machine worldwide, has racked up losses of more than Dollars 2bn in the past two years. It was exposed earlier than its rivals by the long-lived recession in the UK, its biggest market in Europe. Ford has already conceded that it will remain in loss in Europe in 1993 for a third successive year, despite tough steps begun late last year to restructure. Ford is cutting the workforce of its European automotive operations (excluding Jaguar) by 14.8 per cent, with the elimination of 14,400 jobs between October 1992 and the end of 1993. The target is to reduce the workforce to 83,000 from 97,400 over 15 months. The company acknowledges that if the European economy continues to weaken, it may have to make additional job cuts. Fiat's car and light commercial vehicle operations (Fiat Auto) plunged into an operating loss of L544bn (Pounds 229.72m) last year after a three-year slide from an operating profit of L2,362bn in 1989. With its domestic market share in Italy under heavy attack, and falling market share across Europe, Fiat Auto had been forced to start cutting production by late 1990. It eliminated output of 259,000 vehicles in 1991, 230,000 last year and 173,000 in the first six months this year alone. Its workforce has been reduced from 133,431 in 1989 to 125,378 last year. The Renault group of France managed almost to double its annual profits in 1992 and then to fall into loss in the final quarter, pushed down by the turmoil in the European currency markets, its share of losses at its partner Volvo, and the losses of its truck operations. The most serious problems have emerged in Germany, however, where Volkswagen, the group which has led the west European market in terms of sales volumes for the past eight years, crashed badly into loss in the final quarter last year. After making a pre-tax profit of DM1.2bn in the first nine months last year, it fell into a pre-tax loss of DM563m in the final quarter and has followed this with a DM1.6bn loss in the first six months of 1993. In Europe, the rot set in during the final months of last year, as orders in most European car markets suddenly began to shrink and carmakers were left with bloated stocks and plants turned out cars for which there were no customers. According to James Capel, the UK financial analysts, 'the first quarter of 1993 has been the worst period for earnings (in the European car industry) since the early 1980s and possibly for a period much longer than that'. There was no improvement in car demand in the second quarter. During the second half of the 1980s, new car sales in west Europe bounded from one record year to another, with sales jumping from 10.17m in 1984 to 13.47m in 1989. For another three years from 1990 to 1992 demand held steady, near the record level of 13.5m. Beneath the deceptively calm surface, however, all was not well; demand began to diverge wildly in the important markets. Sales in the UK, with the early onset of recession, slumped by a third from the 1989 peak. Sales faltered also in France. These setbacks were more than compensated for, however, by the unprecedented surge in new car sales that took place in Germany, Europe's biggest market, in the wake of unification of the country's east and west. Carmakers - most of all the Volkswagen group, which controls about 28 per cent of the German market - were able to surfboard on the rising wave of demand in Germany, where the car market surged from 2.8m in 1989 to 4.2m in 1991 and 3.9m last year. But the German market, the driving force in Europe, has moved alarmingly into reverse this year, and its fate has been shared elsewhere. Excepting only the UK, new car markets across western Europe have seriously shrunk in the first half of 1993. Nearly 1.3m fewer new cars were sold in west Europe in the first six months this year than in the corresponding period of 1992, as demand plunged by 17.2 per cent to around 6.1m according to industry estimates. In July sales dropped by around 20.1 per cent further intensifying the already steep decline suffered in the first half of the year. West Europe is experiencing its sharpest fall in new car demand for more than a decade, with sales in the first seven months drastically lower than a year ago in 16 of 17 markets. The only significant gain has come in the UK with a rise of 9.1 per cent in the first seven months, albeit from a very depressed level. In Germany sales in the first seven months fell year-on-year by 20.6 per cent, in Italy the decline was 23.6 per cent, in France 17.1 per cent and in Spain 27.7 per cent. Leading carmakers' latest forecasts suggest that sales could fall as low as 11.4m in the full year. All carmakers in Europe are under fierce pressure. Only the UK's Rover group, a subsidiary of British Aerospace, is increasing its European sales in spite of the serious decline in the overall market. The German industry is feeling the heat most intensely. By far the most powerful in Europe, the German car industry had rested on its laurels for too long. Now it is finding that a bloated cost-base has made it disturbingly uncompetitive not only against Japanese carmakers but also against its European rivals. 'Production costs in Germany are too high,' says Mr Erika Emmerich, president of the German auto federation. 'The cause is labour costs as well as energy, transport and environmental costs. Working hours are shorter than in the auto industries of most other countries. And corporation tax is higher than in our most important competing countries.' Based on exchange rates last December German carmakers had total wage costs of DM47 per hour, two-thirds higher than the average of DM28.3 in the rest of Europe, and 37 per cent higher than in the US and Japan at DM34.4 per hour. German car workers clocked up only 1,483 hours in 1991 (the latest figures available), a third less than the 2,181 hours worked by a Japanese car worker, and 27 per cent less than their counterparts in the US at 2,022 hours. German annual working hours are also well below the UK (1,830 hours), France (1,608) and Spain (1,654). According to Mr Ferdinand Piech, the beleaguered chief executive of Volkswagen, the group's current difficulties 'can only be blamed in small part on the weakness of new car sales - and the same is true for other German manufacturers. The cause is rather the structural problems of the entire sector, which are now being openly exposed by the recession. 'We have to accept that in the eight years of booming sales we did not do our homework. Because as soon as sales fall we are in the red,' he says. Intent on expanding its sales and market share at the expense of cutting fat from the organisation and keeping costs under control, Volkswagen, the European market leader, has become the continent's highest cost producer. French carmakers have a 20 per cent cost advantage over the group, says Mr Piech, and the Japanese a lead of 25-30 per cent. Jobs are being cut. Last year's 7,500 reduction at VW's six domestic German plants is to be followed by a cut of about 15,500 in 1993 and 1994. The workforce at these plants will cut to 100,000 by the end of 1994. Worldwide the group, which includes Audi, Seat and Skoda, is cutting at least 33,000 jobs in 1993/94 to 240,000. Capital investments are being drastically reduced with a halving of planned spending across the group and a virtual halt on investment at Audi and Seat for the second half of the year. Components suppliers are being put under severe pressure to cut prices with some reporting demands for cuts of up to 30 per cent over the next three years. Volkswagen is not alone in having to resort to such drastic measures. In a stunning departure from corporate tradition Mercedes-Benz, the world's most prestigious luxury carmaker, is re-thinking the whole way it does business with an 'extensive realignment of its strategic product policy' led by Mr Helmut Werner, who took over as chief executive in May. He admitted earlier this year that Mercedes-Benz's present luxury and executive cars were 'over-engineered', and said that the company would end up being priced out of world markets if it persisted with such a policy for developing new models. Mr Werner said the only way Mercedes-Benz could maintain its engineering and quality leadership, was if it could also achieve cost leadership. Gone were the days, when the charging of premium prices could cover for an uncompetitive cost-base. 'No one in the world is prepared to pay for German complacency on the cost front,' said Mr Werner. About 13,000 jobs were cut by Mercedes-Benz last year in Germany (at its car and commercial vehicle operations) reducing the workforce from 225,000 to 212,000 by the end of 1992. Another 14,500 jobs are scheduled to be cut in the next two years. More vehicle assembly is being moved outside Germany to locations such as Mexico, South Korea and Spain. Mercedes-Benz is also following BMW to the US, where both groups are building their first passenger vehicle assembly plants. The pain of recession in Europe is being exacerbated by the building of additional plant capacity across the continent. The new facilities were planned as west European car producers were still basking in the years of successive annual sales records. European producers are bringing into production plants with a capacity for about 1.5m vehicles a year between mid-1992 and the end of 1994, although VW has delayed part of its expansion in eastern Germany. Japanese vehicle makers are expected to have built a capacity in Europe for about 1.2m vehicles a year by the end of the decade. 'The whole industry but European manufacturers in particular have to face one particularly severe international challenge. This is worldwide overcapacity,' says Mr Bruno Adelt, executive vice-president of the Volkswagen brand division. 'For the remainder of the 1990s we estimate this at more than 10m vehicles. . . Excess capacities in Europe will greatly increase, competition will be tougher and above all pressure to sell at lower prices will increase dramatically.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS                             January-July 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Volume     Volume     Share (%)   Share (%)                           (Units)  Change (%)   Jan-Jul 93  Jan-Jul 92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET           7,001,000     -17.7        100.0       100.0 MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen* (incl.     1,170,000     -22.5         16.7        17.8 Audi, SEAT &amp; Skoda) General Motors           897,000     -14.4         12.8        12.3 (Opel/Vauxhall, US**** &amp; Saab)  -Opel/Vauxhall          862,000     -14.0         12.3        11.8  -Saab**                  23,000     -30.8          0.3         0.4 Peugeot (incl.           840,000     -17.4         12.0        12.0 Citroen) Fiat (incl.

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Letter: V-2 rocket pioneers guided by space-age dream Sir, Why are the British furious about the commemoration of the V-2 rocket? To me, they seem to have lost the ability to take an unbiased view of that fantastic technological breakthrough. I am proud of the fact that inventors and engineers from my country opened the gate to space technology and the landing on the moon. As early as the 1930s the ingenious Dr Werner von Braun dreamt of the space age and - to put it bluntly - the V-2 was an aunt of the famous Saturn V b. Those pioneers were guided by space enthusiasm and not by the idea of bombing the British capital. I think you would have to concede that Sir Arthur Harris did not have that dream when he was bombing women and children in Dresden. Hermann-Josef Kromer, Im Edle 11, 7930 Ehingen 2, Germany</p>

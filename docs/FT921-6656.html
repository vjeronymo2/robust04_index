			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE ABSENCE of any signs of reduction in UK interest rates, together with figures showing a fall in US consumer confidence, caused a retreat in FT-SE stock index futures after an initial jump, writes Joel Kibazo. The March contract, having started the session at 2,579, saw light selling. The downward trend was, however, reversed by speculation, later confirmed, of a 0.25 per cent cut in the Bank of Spain's official intervention rate. This triggered a squeeze in the March future, sending it to the day's high of 2,596 as dealers anticipated that the Bank of England might soon follow suit. It did not, and selling followed which gathered pace with the release of poor US consumer confidence statistics. These, in turn, led to falls on Wall Street, once again hurting the March contract. March finished at 2,557, around 4 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6. Turnover reached almost 7,000 contracts. Traded options remained dull, volume totalling 24,491 contracts, with the FT-SE 100 index option having 8,872 lots transacted. British Airways was the busiest stock option, with 1,744 lots dealt.</p>

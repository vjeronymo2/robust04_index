			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Cookson cuts borrowings by another Pounds 18m Cookson, the industrial materials group, has announced a co-ordinated series of acquisitions and disposals affecting its business supplying the European steel industry. Net proceeds from the four deals will be Pounds 18m. The announcement follows the group's successful Pounds 82.8m rights issue, which it said on Friday was 96 per cent taken up by shareholders. The combined effect of the rights and the recent deals will be to reduce Cookson's net borrowings from Pounds 330m to Pounds 230m. Gearing, which was above 100 per cent when the group suffered a crisis of confidence last autumn, will fall to 35 per cent. Most important of the deals is the Pounds 23.7m sale of Cookson Plibrico International to ILVA, the Italian state-owned steel group. Plibrico makes furnace linings for steelworks and made operating profits of Pounds 2.9m last year. The other deals, which are worth less than Pounds 5m each, include the acquisition by Cookson of Metacon, a private Swiss company which designs slide gates for steel casting, and two acquisitions by Vesuvius Italia, an existing joint venture of ILVA and Cookson.</p>

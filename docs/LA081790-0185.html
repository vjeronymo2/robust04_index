			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUT, GAINES IS GOING TO ALSO TRY  </P> <P> Former Vanderbilt football player Brad Gaines says he's ready to challenge the  NCAA in court.  </P> <P> Gaines, who made himself available for this spring's National Football League  draft but was not selected, contends that he should not lose his final year of  eligibility with the Commodores.  </P> <P> Gaines and his attorney, former Vanderbilt quarterback Roger May, contend that  Gaines should not be considered a professional since he was not drafted and he  never contacted an agent.  </P> <P> May said Vanderbilt would be named in the suit as a "nominal party" but the  suit is actually against the NCAA.  </P> <P> "I just want to play football," Gaines said Thursday night before referring all  other questions to May.  </P> <P> Vanderbilt football Coach Watson Brown said the case is strictly a legal  matter.  </P> <P> "If the court rules Brad can play, we'll welcome him back. But we're not going  to break any NCAA rules," Brown said.  </P> <P> May said Gaines' case parallels that of former Notre Dame player Braxton Banks,  whose request to return to college football was denied today by a federal  judge.  </P> <P> Before the Banks decision, Gaines said he may pursue his case even if the  Indiana court rules against Banks, May said.  </P> <P> "If that happens, we will sit down and think about it. I feel the suit has  merit, and Brad's case is even more compelling than Banks'. Banks contacted an  agent, which is against NCAA rules, while Brad did not," May said.  </P></p>

			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo extends slide and closes below 15,000 Tokyo THE Nikkei average extended its slide to a fourth consecutive day, closing below the 15,000 level for the first time since March 1986, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index fell 243.78 to 14,822.56, a four-day loss of 7.3 per cent. It rose to the day's high of 15,172.72 in the morning but hit a low of 14,777.90 just before the close as small-lot selling by individuals and futures-linked trading depressed sentiment. Volume declined to 190m shares from 201m. Declines led advances by 788 to 96, with 108 unchanged, and a total of 548 issues fell to new lows for the year. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 21.76 to 1,126.80 while, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.68 to 933.46. Fears over bankruptcies among companies with high exposure to the stock and real estate markets resurfaced and prompted short-selling. The plunge in share prices, however, raised hopes of further monetary easing, causing a rally on the government bond market. The yield on the No 129 10-year benchmark bond fell 0.036 percentage points to 4.985 per cent, and short-term money market rates also eased on anticipation of lower interest rates. Comments by government officials that measures to prop up share prices may be brought forward have had little effect on sentiment. Furthermore, proposals to buy land placed as collateral at the banks, or to invest postal savings funds in the stock market have not provided fresh trading incentives. 'The longer the government takes to implement economic measures such as the supplementary budget, the slimmer the effects will be,' said Mr Robert Feldman at Salomon Brothers. Speculators continued to liquidate issues bought on margin. Okamoto Industries, the most active issue of the day, fell Y42 to Y825, and Meiji Milk Products lost Y31 to Y729. Companies famous for their stock market investments in the late eighties plunged. Hanwa, the steel trader, fell Y142 to Y928 and Hazama, the construction company, fell Y35 to Y290. Nippon Credit Bank, which faces mounting bad property-related loans, declined by its daily limit of Y500 to Y3,600. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y2,000 to Y465,000. The share has fallen 19.3 per cent over the past four trading days. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 317.75 to 16,014.06 with 11.4m shares traded. Roundup TOKYO's decline again affected sentiment and most of the region's markets were dragged lower. HONG KONG saw moderate gains, influenced by the futures market trading. The Hang Seng Index advanced 18.81 to 5,886.75 in turnover of HKDollars 1.83bn. Hutchison Whampoa was the most actively traded share after its share placement on Monday but it closed unchanged at HKDollars 15.50. Cheung Kong rose 20 cents to HKDollars 23.80. SEOUL fell but reports that the government may announce the award of the country's second telecom contract next week helped bidding companies. Sunkyong and Yukong, which have bid for the contract, both rose Won1,000 to Won21,500 and Won23,500 respectively. The composite stock index shed 5.43 to 502.45 in turnover of Won102bn. TAIWAN finished mixed as most investors remained on the sidelines. The weighted index closed up 6.55 at 3,958.28 in low turnover of TDollars 17.6bn. Cement, food and plastic shares fell slightly but other sectors were up. MANILA was largely unmoved by the resignation of one of President Fidel Ramos's close aides. The composite index lost 0.02 to 1,445.67 in combined turnover of 205m pesos. SINGAPORE lost 2.2 per cent as foreign investors sold bank stocks and blue chips. The Straits Times Industrial index closed down 31.68 at 1,392.91 in turnover of SDollars 94.2m. Development Bank of Singapore foreign shares ended 90 cents lower at SDollars 12.00 with some 401,000 shares traded. Oversea-Chinese Banking foreign shed 90 cents to SDollars 11.80 in volume of 757,000 shares. KUALA LUMPUR was pulled higher by Telekom which gained 30 cents to MDollars 14.10. The composite index closed 2.64 higher at 597.80. Resorts World fell 40 cents to MDollars 6.60 after reporting flat half-year earnings. AUSTRALIA fell as the local currency weakened against the US dollar. The All Ordinaries closed down 4.6 at 1,587.6 in turnover of ADollars 144.4m. Alcan closed up 1 cent at ADollars 1.72 after reporting a better-than-expected interim loss of ADollars 6.5m. NEW ZEALAND's NZSE 40 index closed 8.52 lower at 1,514.68. BOMBAY rose strongly in spite of a bout of late profit-taking. The BSE index closed up 24.44 at 2,693.42.</p>

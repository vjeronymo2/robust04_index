			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Australia may increase rates Mr Bernie Fraser, governor of the Australian Reserve Bank, yesterday foreshadowed another increase in interest rates as a way of maintaining an underlying rate of inflation of 2-3 per cent for the rest of the financial year 1994-95. 'I am confident appropriate adjustments will be made in monetary policy that will deliver a 2-3 per cent underlying rate of inflation,' he told a federal parliamentary committee. Mr Fraser also said the government could do better to reduce its forecast budget deficit for 1994-95. The budget has estimated a deficit of ADollars 11.7bn (Pounds 5.8bn) for the year, representing 2.5 per cent of GDP. He warned a better performance on the fiscal side did not reduce the need to tighten monetary policy when necessary. A strong jobs growth reported last week had intensified pressures on the government to raise interest rates. More than 75,000 new jobs were created in September, reflecting an acceleration in economic activity.</p>

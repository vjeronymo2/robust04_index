			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Platinum opened up a premium of more than Dollars 5 a troy ounce over gold on the London bullion market yesterday. US chartists said Nymex platinum futures prices were lingering near a key chart area that would either result in a Dollars 20 rise or a resumption of the recent downtrend. New York analysts said rumours continued to circulate about cash market buying by South African producers, as well as news that Russia's Norilsk nickel plant was cutting exports. Traders are concerned that reductions in nickel exports and output could spill over to platinum, a by-product at Norilsk. Silver and gold closed steady. 'It's a Dollars 354 to Dollars 358 range on gold and a 412 to 422 cent range in silver,' said one dealer. 'Client business is low and you acknowledge those ranges as they get narrower and narrower indicating a break-out will be quite a good move.' London May cocoa closed at a five-month low of Pounds 724 a tonne. 'Earlier fund selling seems to have dried up, which is allowing the market to consolidate to a certain extent, but it is not oversold so there is no reason for a technical bounce,' said one dealer. Market expectation of origin selling by the Ivory Coast is a major factor in the pressure on prices. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Lajos Fur by Peter Vajda; </F> place and date not given: "Lajos Fur: The MDF Has Come Around"]    [Excerpts] It can be seen as virtually settled that Lajos  Fur will be the official nominee for party chairmanship in the  Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and his election can be seen as  certain. He will probably keep his office of defense minister  even when he is party chairman. Our correspondent interviewed  him on issues he will be responsible for in his two capacities.  [passage omitted]    [Vajda] The situation is different from that before 1990 and  you are probably thinking in terms of some kind of coalition. I  assume that various versions emerge. [MDF Deputy Chairman  Sandor] Lezsak, whose views are considered to be close to yours  in many respects, once said that he cannot imagine any kind of  cooperation with the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], the  main reason being its attitude toward the churches. Do you  share Lezsak's view on this?    [Fur] More or less I do, although he said this rather a long  time ago, perhaps two months ago.... The Fidesz appears to be  undergoing a big process of change. It is impossible to know  its direction because all changes, if the Fidesz's mentality  will indeed change, are difficult to accomplish. It is  difficult to give up the habits. It is a fact that they have  lately been proclaiming that the Fidesz is a center party and  wishes to remain so, it has a national commitment, it fully  represents the cause of the Hungarian national minorities, and  it wishes to remain free of all extremisms. This, I believe,  means distancing from the extreme right as well as the extreme  left or left-wing parties. In my view, it would not now be  possible to say that we will not enter into any kind of  political dialogue with the Fidesz under any circumstances, but  we cannot say that let us embrace each other, either. [passage  omitted]    [Vajda] Let us turn to the Army. To be frank: Is it able  to function?    [Fur] The current situation is indeed very difficult but  this is not a result of the past two to three years. The last  big purchases were done in the first half of the 1970's. A  little was also done in the early 1980's but nothing at all has  been bought in the past 10 to 15 years. This is not to mention  the structures, barracks, buildings, and dwellings. The last  big constructions took place in the 1950's and 1960's, nothing  has been done since then. Not even maintenance. It is not in  these two to three years that everything is trying to fall on  top of us, this is the result of a long process. Everyone is  aware of the country's economic situation. Whenever it was  possible, I fought tooth and nail for increasing our budget. It  would hardly have been possible to achieve more than what we  actually received, and even this is reduced by various taxes and  levies. I know that for a lieutenant who has basic problems of  survival -- whether he can buy meat for himself or he can pay  rent or heating -- this is poor comfort but this is how much we  have. If the government accepts the proposal on the legal  status of soldiers and it is also passed by Parliament then the  pay of regular soldiers can significantly be increased possibly  this year, but certainly from 1995. [passage omitted]    [Vajda] Are you, the first team of the change of the regime,  a little bitter because your hopes of receiving Western help --  for example, in developing the Army, among other things -- have  not really materialized? During talks with your Western  colleagues, do you express that a certain amount of  disappointment exists because of this?    [Fur] I certainly voice these feelings. I partly express  our disappointment because we did not manage to make any  progress, or at least we did not really manage to start  including modern technology in the Hungarian Army. We also  express our feeling of regret because this region has not  received the necessary guarantees we would have liked in the  area of security.    [Vajda] You are obviously also thinking of the case when we  allowed certain aerial activity in our airspace, and [former]  Prime Minister Antall had asked for definite guarantees -- and  this was leaked in the Western press -- but we did not receive  these, either.    [Fur] AWACS planes circled above us at that time. As for  guarantees, we received verbal promise that any kind of harm to  Hungary would at the same time mean a challenge for the West and  it would not leave it at that. However, it is difficult to know  what this actually means in practice. This kind of  disappointment exists in Hungary and in other countries of the  region. On the other hand, it will still be possible to make  progress through the new partnership, if in nothing else then in  establishing real military links because, up to now, we have  only had visits....    [Vajda] Nevertheless, this is a little less than what you  wanted.    [Fur] It is less because obviously we wanted more, but this  is what we can have and we have to make do with this. More  precisely, we will have to be able to make good use of this  because certain possibilities do exist here. For example, we  might be able to start bringing in small amounts of new  technology mainly through setting up and operating the  peacekeeping forces.  <H5>  Normalization With Serbia </H5>   [Vajda] What do we expect from the Russians? What will  happen to the remainder of their debt?    [Fuir] As a minister, I would be happiest if we managed to  settle this remaining $800 million through some military  purchases, but other viewpoints also exist. We do not yet fully  know the Russian views, either. In Russia, various guesses and  ideas emerge from time to time but I do not know if they all  have a realistic basis.    [Vajda] A military expert actually wrote that the  leadership of the Defense Ministry, including the minister, are  in love with the E300 defense system. Have we really fully  committed ourselves to this system?    [Fur] This is not a matter of love, this is a forced  situation.    [Vajda] However, do we need this system?    [Fur] We would need it. Our sky still has a hole in it.  This system would be the best one to fill this hole.    [Vajda] The reconstruction of the MiG-21s: Have you managed  to achieve anything with the Israelis who, as it is known, deal  with modernizing the airplanes? Is there a realistic hope or  are we going to throw out these airplanes?    [Fur] No, we do not want to discard them. This also depends  on the budget and on what methods the Israelis happen to find to  modernize them. We have looked at a few bases in Israel where  this is done. They would be ready to modernize these airplanes;  they are also conducting talks with other countries on similar  issues. The question is whether we can assign adequate funds to  this and whether they can give us favorable offers on future  payments or other financial methods. A number of solutions can  exist.    [Vajda] You were a champion of developing military links  with our neighbors, namely Slovakia and Romania. Relations with  the Serbs have come on the agenda in Hungarian foreign policy.  Can we expect some kind of settlement of Hungarian-Serbian  relations?    [Fur] We have had links and still have them, mainly in the  areas of aerial control and air defense.    [Vajda] All the public can see from this is that the Serbian  military attache is called in and we protest against the aerial  violations over Szeged.    [Fur] We also have other contacts and we have had higher  level meetings in the past period where these cases of border  violations, more precisely, the ways to prevent them, were  discussed. Recently, since the fighting moved over to Bosnia,  we have not really had any such events. Our military contacts  have not been severed although, as it is known, the Serbian, or  little Yugoslavian, higher level military leadership has been  replaced three times in the past two to three years. The 1990  leadership was replaced in 1992, then these were also replaced  later including the generals, the leadership, and everything.    [Vajda] This also happens in Hungary below the level of  minister....    [Fur] Not to this extent.... In our case, this is a natural  turnover while there, I believe, an artificial replacement took  place. The main point is that we do have contacts, and I trust  that, if we manage to settle relations on a political level --  as [Foreign Minister] Geza Jeszenszky's recent visit to Belgrade  indicated this, having confidence in advance -- then higher  level or top level meetings can also take place.    [Vajda] Would you accept an invitation to Belgrade?    [Fur] I certainly would if the conditions were right.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Italy - Correction STANDARD &amp; Poor's has asked us to point out that it has never accorded a triple-A rating to Italy, as was implied in a report on March 16, 'Debt mountain still unclimbed amid turmoil'. It rated Italy double-A plus until March 2 1983, when the rating was lowered to double-A.</p>

Referring to the  banana issue, Agriculture Minister Mariano Gonzalez declared  that is why we have taken our position on foreign trade and have  said "no more obstacles to foreign trade."    The minister is firm in his position that "there must be a  global quota and that market forces must be allowed to operate,  so that those who can offer the best quality fruit at the best  price are able to win a given share."    He admitted that centralism exists in the Ecuadoran  Institute  of Water Resources (INERHI) and said that "the current  government has known of these irregularities from the  beginning," and the National Council of Water Resources will be  created as a result.    Gonzalez spoke with EL UNIVERSO during his recent visit to  the Galapagos Islands to fulfill obligations of the chief  executive. The interview follows:    [Peralta] After a lengthy process of negotiation, what is  the  situation with the country's banana trade?    [Gonzalez] If you start with the great discussions in 1992  about what could happen, and the famous fights, including the  meeting of presidents "all fighting for free trade," the  negotiations were not really successful, because regulation 404  was imposed at almost any cost by the European Community.    But everything has its good side and its bad side. On the  good side is the fact that now we can enter markets that we  could not legally reach before, such as France, England,  Portugal, among other countries. The negative is that the global  quota was reduced, and since then, there has been an effort led  by Colombia to try to make the rule more viable. What was  accomplished was not enough. Even more serious is that the  Colombian Government did not consult with the other banana  exporting countries, which caused resentment among most of us.    The Ministry of Agriculture has been much criticized as  having no policy, but I must say that "it was not by luck that  our country for the third consecutive year was the principal  banana exporter to the EC, and we continue to lead in the world  market as the first exporting country. This has been achieved by  a policy of lowering prices at the opportune moment and by being  attentive to changes in the market."    [Peralta] At the moment, one sees a divided region, Latin  American unity no longer exists. How much does this affect us?    [Gonzalez] On learning of a division of the quota with the  agreement of Colombia and Costa Rica, we learned that Ecuador  would have no opportunity to win new markets until the year 2000  or 2002, and the quota they gave us was all we could sell.    This is why we have maintained the position, supported by  Panama and Guatemala, that there must be a global quota and that  market forces be allowed to operate, so that those who can offer  the best quality fruit at the best price are able to win a given  share. I believe that this is the idea that has prevailed  recently.    I am sorry not to have attended the meeting called by Costa  Rica, but I was also concerned because there had been certain  rumors inside the GATT to the effect that the European Union's  proposal would be discussed again at the Costa Rica meeting.  When we learned of this, it seemed to us that it would be  inopportune to attend the meeting because it would send a signal  to the GATT that we were prepared to discuss a proposal that had  already been discussed and to which "we had already said no."    We talked to Costa Rica and we said that we were willing to  meet as often as necessary, but only when the results of the  second panel's hearings are known. It is important to emphasize  that there were to be two panels before the GATT, and that the  GATT would later say that these regulations were not legal.    Based on these two legal-type resolutions and within the  Uruguay Round, we will take the necessary steps to change  regulation 404 and make it more compatible with free trade.    [Peralta] What would be Ecuador's position?    [Gonzalez] What Ecuador asks specifically is that a time  limit of five or 10 years be placed on regulation 404, perhaps  the life of the treaty of Lome. This is the treaty that ties the  EC countries to a commitment with those ex-colonies even though  they are aware that what they produce is not of good quality and  is more expensive than what Latin America produces.    We also ask that they place a time limit on the existing  taxes, a reduction to apply gradually to what was really agreed  on in the Uruguay Round. It would be a reduction equal to that  planned for the developed countries in the commitment to move to  lower tariffs.    We also intend to try to increase the global quota because  the latest figures on banana sales to the European Union talk of  2.5 million tons and the fixed quota is 2.2 million tons.    [Peralta] European integration brings with it the danger of  reducing the market. How are you going to deal with this  situation?    [Gonzalez] In fact, another reason we are saying that the  quota should be increased over time is that there are countries  we are selling bananas to that are not members of the EC but  that are asking to enter it. The moment they enter the EC, and  if there is a fixed quota, they would be diminishing the market.  If the countries where we are now selling fruit come under the  EC quota, we will be prevented from selling our bananas freely,  as we have been doing until now.    With regard to this situation, we maintain that whenever a  new country enters the EC, the quota should be increased so that  we can continue selling to those markets as we have been able to  do under free trade.    It should not be forgotten that Ecuador has a disadvantage  since in order to reach the European market, to which we send 30  percent of our exports, we have to consider the passage through  the Panama Canal and the added distance. In order to compete  with Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Honduras, we have to have a  product cheap enough to absorb the additional cost of the canal  and the distance.    When Colombia and Costa Rica asked us to agree to the EU  proposal, we told them that if we agreed to a fixed quota we  would be agreeing to a position that is unfair. These are the  basic outlines of our foreign trade policy, and we have said "no  more obstacles to trade."    We did not attend the meeting in Costa Rica. We spoke with  that country and told them that we are sympathetic to the idea  of trying to reform regulation 404, but what has been proposed  is not suitable. We are waiting to learn the result of the  hearings, and we are pretty sure that they will say that the  regulation is improper. Then we will initiate a commercial-type  procedure prior to the 15 March signing of the Uruguay Round in  order to say to the EC "now let us sit down and talk, based on  these precepts."    They have said that if we do not accept their proposal,  there  will be no further negotiations, but we do not agree, and if  they do not want to discuss it, we prefer to stay with  regulation 404 as it is, rather than try for a new regulation.    [Peralta] Given the existence of quotas, what is the outlook  for producers and exporters?    [Gonzalez] The ministry has had a very clear policy  maintaining that it is in our interest to export a great volume  of bananas and to set minimum export conditions, so that the  country exports as many bananas as possible. When prices rise  too high and market conditions become difficult, the first to  suffer is the small farmer, because the large producer has his  basic contracts with the big exporting companies, and he is the  last to suffer.    Consequently, if there is a greater demand for fruit at a  given moment, as is happening now, the minimum price for exports  increases.    At this point we should be exporting more than in 1993. The  first three weeks of 1994 have been excellent; between 2.7 and  2.8 million boxes have been shipped, which is very good for this  time of year, and if this trend continues the year will be  favorable.    Furthermore, the National Banana Program no longer takes a  deduction from the producers. The only one who pays any kind of  contribution, and it is very small, is the exporter, but with  the increase in price in effect since 15 January, the producer  will have more profits and will be able to take care of some of  the debts and other problems that he might have incurred during  the second part of the year.    It could even happen that prices rise above the official  levels decreed by the government, during the coming months. I  know that the first purchases by Chiquita were made this year,  which means that another multinational has come to our country  to buy. To the extent that we maintain a healthy  competitiveness, we could see better days, in commercial terms,  improved incomes, and more profits for the banana sector.    [Peralta] Will the country's membership in the GATT  influence  its position on bananas?    [Gonzalez] To enter the GATT, the country has to fulfill  certain commitments. This week, a delegation from our country  will begin new negotiations, there will be others in February  and "we expect that by March or April, if there is no problem,  we will be able to join the GATT, and we hope that it will be  before the signing of the Uruguay Round."    [Peralta] The national position on agriculture has been  criticized in the Andean Pact. Are there problems for the  country?    [Gonzalez] We have to wait for the consolidation and the  formation of the new Venezuelan Government, which is the source  of most of the criticism. We hope to go ahead with the  negotiations, as we have done so far. In reality, a consensus on  agricultural policies exists among all the ministers of  agriculture. Under the Cartagena agreement, agricultural matters  are often negotiated that are outside my jurisdiction.    We have had a very clear policy on agricultural markets,  regardless of what others may say who maintain that we should  open up to the world market. We are protecting those products  that are receiving subsidies elsewhere in the world. This is why  we speak of price margins, it is the protection we give our  farmers.    I have been criticized because I do not subsidize producers,  and the reason is very simple. We have no money. And since we  cannot subsidize our producers, we have to provide a margin of  protection against unfair competition.    I must simply tell those who doubt the results that in 1993,  we exported more than 60,000 tons to Colombia, we exported an  important amount of rice, some soya, but it is a process that  our producers must continue to learn. To the extent that we have  responsible leadership in the associations, "especially on the  coast," we can open up new markets and give incentives to the  farmers to produce.    The problem in our country is not producing but marketing,  and that depends basically on our farmers, on their business  skills and on the farmers' associations. Unfortunately, we have  no leadership on the coast, and that is a large part of the  problem we are having in being able to market our products in  the region and around the world.    [Peralta] Now that the Modernization Law has been passed,  what steps is your ministry taking?    [Gonzalez] So far, as a result of decisions we have taken,  there is new restructuring of the ministry that is being carried  out by SENDA [National Secretariat of Administrative  Development]. We made certain changes because there were some  difficulties in the original presentation. We achieved a very  important reduction in personnel on the order of 25 percent and  we expect, with the Modernization Law, to make the final  adjustments, without sacrificing the ministry's technical  capability, as such.    The ministry should have a normative rather than an  executive  role. In other words, if we have to work in the area of  agricultural extension services, we are not going to do it with  ministry personnel but contract the work out, and if the  objectives are not being achieved, we will have the option of  canceling the contract, which we do not have now.    [Peralta] ENAC [National Enterprise for Warehousing and  Marketing] and ENPROVIT [National Enterprise for Vital Products]  are the first to pass into the private sector. What comes next?    [Gonzalez] We took the first step with ENAC and ENPROVIT.  There were a great many stores in ENPROVIT that are no longer  part of that institution, and when we evaluated the sales, we  saw that we sold three times more with 60 of those stores than  we sold in 200 of the stores that we still have. That does not  include the stores owned by ex-employees that are really doing  well, since they do not sell only 12 products, but whatever they  want.    With ENAC, we have leased its silos and we expect to turn  over to farmers other silos that we still have.    In addition, we also have some driers that we want to give  directly to the growers' associations so that those who do not  want to turn over their rice to the warehouses can negotiate  their own terms.    The next step under the Modernization Law is that those  persons who were not covered by the ministry's authority to  negotiate their separation directly under their labor contracts  can now do so. The Modernization Law will allow us to make a  further reduction, but the process of modernization in the  various offices and departments of the ministry has already  begun and will continue, using the instruments that have been  given to us.    The most important asset we have is the Gran Colombiana  Merchant Fleet, in which we own 20 percent of the shares. The  board of directors of the fleet has already given its approval  for a representative to make an appraisal and arrange for the  sale of those shares. The Coffee Bank of Colombia has offered  another 25 percent of the shares for sale, which with Ecuador's  20 percent would make a package of 45 percent of the shares. We  expect that this process will last two or three months more, and  we will sell our interest in this important firm in order to  capitalize the Development Bank. Unfortunately, these procedures  take longer than one would like, but "we are on the road."    [Peralta] According to the law, there is a time limit for  the  sale of vehicles and the auctioning off of real property. What  has been done?    [Gonzalez] The ministry has about 3,000 vehicles, of which  1,400 are operational. We have about 700 in poor condition that  give us problems. The order has been given to sell those  vehicles belonging to the various departments of the ministry. A  general order was also given regarding the sale of clubs and  offices, as well as nonproductive lands belonging to the  departments. We have ordered that they also be sold.    [Peralta] To judge from the subjects under consideration, it  would seem that the aim is to create the Ministry of  Agroindustry and to eliminate the Ministry of Agriculture?    [Gonzalez] That is definitely not the case. The Ministry of  Industry has its own responsibilities. What has happened is that  there have been a number of changes, three ministers in 17  months. I spoke with then-Minister Garcia and he told me "you  continue to handle this situation, since you have been following  it from the beginning, but in fact it is something that is the  responsibility of the Ministry of Industry."    We discussed this with Minister Maldonado, and, little by  little, as he becomes familiar with all the details of what has  happened in the negotiations, he will assume responsibility. The  internal policies are really the responsibility of the Ministry  of Industry, but there have been no talks in the sense of  reducing his area of responsibility.</p>

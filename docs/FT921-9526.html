			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Perrier jumps 7.5% as stock comes back into play PAPER stocks were weak across the Continent yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS concentrated on takeover target Perrier, which was re-quoted for the first time since its suspension on January 20. The stock jumped FFr105 or 7.5 per cent to FFr1,501, with a heavy 157,925 shares exchanged in two-way trading as some investors took their profits and others sought to get a piece of the action. Dealers said the stock was also being kept above Nestle's offer of FFr1,475 to prevent the Swiss group from picking up Perrier cheaply. The day's biggest gainer was construction company SAE, which jumped FFr183 or 19.9 per cent to FFr1,103 with 10,975 shares traded. The shares were re-quoted yesterday following CBV's approval on Friday of a FFr1,110 a share bid from its fellow builder, Fougerolle. The CAC-40 index closed up 3.94 at 1,865.55 in turnover estimated at a light FFr1.6bn. Dealers were surprised that Eurotunnel only fell FFr1.10 to FFr45.85 with 993,000 shares traded in spite of news of a delay in the tunnel's opening. Also on the decline was Elf which lost FFr3.60 to FFr355.40 with 292,500 shares traded on reports that its chairman had mentioned a possible capital increase during a radio interview. FRANKFURT was supported by a tentative move into chemicals, and there was a sprinkling of price fluctuations - mostly on the downside - elsewhere, partly attributed to thin trading as volume slipped from DM4.6bn to DM4.5bn. Hoechst led the big three chemicals up with a DM3 rise to DM252.10. Mr Alex Magona of Paribas Capital Markets said that investors were attracted by the high dividend yields and the sector's recovery prospects. Falls included PWA, the papermaker, down DM7.50 to DM227 on domestic reports that the paper industry sees no immediate prospect of a cyclical upturn; Metallgesellschaft, DM16.70 lower at DM410.10 ahead of today's annual news conference, with the word out that the occasion will not be a happy one; and Hochtief, the construction group, down DM28 to DM1,200 on profit-taking after a period of relative strength. Deutsche Babcock rose DM5.40 to DM174.50. Rumours that Siemens's KWU power generation unit was about to take a stake in Babcock were denied after hours. MILAN fell in reaction to last Friday's fall on Wall Street and the overnight decline in Tokyo. The market was also weakened by technical considerations as chartists expected the Comit index to meet resistance at 550. The Comit index fell 5.63 to 541.95 in turnover estimated at a light L90bn after L98bn on Friday. Burgo, the paper group, came under pressure after an unusually prescient domestic broker forecast that the company would have a bad 1992 because it would be unable to pass on the rise in pulp prices to its customers. The stock fell L360 or 3.9 per cent to L8,890. Ciga, the hotels group, fell L47 to L1,902 after news that it remained in the red in 1991 while turnover was little changed at L490bn. Some brokers' expectations of a turnround in 1993 gave little support to the stock. Sip and Stet, which have started a joint campaign to deter the government from opening up the cellular telephone market, were relatively firm; Sip eased L20 to L1,456 while Stet lost only L4 to L2,380. AMSTERDAM closed mixed with the paper and packaging sector worst hit: VRG, the paper wholesaler, closed down Fl 3.00, or nearly 7 per cent, at Fl 42.80 following Friday's announcement of a lower-than-expected net profit for 1991. This slide carried over to Buehrmann-Tetterode, the printing machinery group, which slipped Fl 0.90 to Fl 43.90. The CBS Tendency Index was unchanged at 121.3. Ahold failed to announce an acquisition at its news conference and declined Fl 0.10 to Fl 80.90. ZURICH closed steady in moderate trade, the SPI index edging 0.2 higher at 1,120.4. Blue chips gained more, with the SMI index of leading shares up 5.8 at 1,785.1. Dealers noted good demand for the chemicals group, Ciba-Geigy, seen as undervalued by some. Its bearers rose SFr50 to SFr3,330. Among banks, Swiss Volksbank firmed SFr20 to SFr990, although it cut its dividend yesterday on a 38 per cent drop in profits. STOCKHOLM fell on Friday's Wall Street declines, and nervousness ahead of today's results from Ericsson. The Affarsvarlden General index ended 12.9 lower at 953.9 with Ericsson B SKr3 lower at SKr181. Procordia B fell another SKr11 to SKr181, down from a 1992 high of SKr220 and paying the price for merger plans with Volvo which failed to get government support. MADRID was flat ahead of Thursday's publication of January inflation figures: analysts are looking for a rise of between 1.7 and 1.9 per cent. The general index closed up 0.03 at 256.14. Telefonica continued firm, with brokers reporting strong US interest: it gained Pta30 or 2.5 per cent, to Pta1,220. The banks were generally weak with Banco de Santander's weekend results being discounted: it slipped Pta25 to Pta4,605. ISTANBUL eased again following a two-day recovery due to lack of new cash and pessimism caused by the delay in the implementation of the capital markets measures announced in mid-January. The index closed at 4,458.79, down 117.34 or 2.6 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - FEB 10                            Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Open    10 am     11 am     12 pm   1 pm      2 pm     3 pm    close 1133.44  1133.33   1134.48  1135.75  1136.51  1136.75  1136.91  1137.68                Day's High  1138.12    Day's Low  1132.89              Feb 7      Feb 6    Feb 5     Feb 4     Feb 3             1137.10   1138.76   1138.71  1132.79    1134.04  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

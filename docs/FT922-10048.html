			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Trainer loses most from Classic fall THE FAILURE this week of Classic Thoroughbreds, the Irish bloodstock company, is likely to cost Mr Vincent O'Brien, the renowned trainer, up to IPounds 2m, or Pounds 1.82m sterling. Other big losers in an experiment to bring the arts of stock market punting to the turf include: Mr Michael Smurfit, the packaging magnate; Mr Robert Sangster, the Vernons Pools boss; and millionaire Mr John Magnier. All are estimated to have lost up to IPounds 1.4m each. But it is perhaps Mr O'Brien, trainer of racing legends such as Nijinsky and The Minstrel, who will suffer the most. Not only did he hold the biggest stake, at 12 per cent, but Classic's failure to produce more than one big winner from its stables will leave the 75-year-old trainer's reputation somewhat diminished. When the company was put out to pasture this week, it offered its 4,500 shareholders a mere 5.25p per share, compared to the 1987 flotation price of 30p. It was almost prophetic that Classic chose October 1987 for the flotation date. Since then, a series of troubles have beset its horses. The first year saw its best horse put down, while in 1989 Classic Fame and Saratogan failed to live up to their early promise and a virus swept through the stables. The following years were little better and punters' patience was tried further by the dramatic collapse in bloodstock prices. Classic's one claim to the big winner's circle in 4 1/2 years was its 40 per cent stake in Royal Academy. This week, the only horse left in the once lively stable of 47 was Classic Music. Mr Michael Walsh, company secretary, reassured callers that the lonely racer would not be put down, but rather put out to stud where it could pay its way until a buyer comes along.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Arts: A gift for Dame Ninette - Ballet Birmingham Royal Ballet has marked the 95th birthday of Dame Ninette de Valois with a long-overdue revival of Job. She made this 'masque for dancing' in 1931 - Vaughan Williams insisted that his score was not for 'a ballet' - and in it we see, still powerful, the pre-eminent qualities of her choreography. De Valois' wide experience of the theatre had, by 1931, taught her the value of clarity and simplicity in movement. In realising a theme inspired by William Blake, she saw how sculptural images, so strong in his drawings, might be realised in the then fashionable form of dance plastique. There resulted choreography as forceful and dramatically vivid as its score and a work which long held a special place in the Sadler's Wells repertory. Ballet-goers of my generation grew up with Job, and with an understanding of the dignity of Dame Ninette's dances. After 20 years without performance, this revival - exemplary in style and feeling, thanks to the eagle eyes of Michael Somes, Joy Newton and Jean Bedells who have staged it - reasserts the continuing vitality of de Valois' creations. (It is time Rake's Progress was brought back to the stage, and I think that BRB's public would rejoice in her wonderfully funny and imaginative Prospect Before Us.) As always, score and design are essential companions in de Valois' theatre. The Vaughan Williams score is thrilling; the John Piper designs, which were commissioned for the post-war Covent Garden revival, are magnificent on their own terms, and echo Blake - and Samuel Palmer - to beautiful effect. Job is, in sum, a grand achievement; it is a salutary reminder of how our national ballet once involved major British artists in creations of enduring significance. The Birmingham cast on Wednesday night was fine. Satan's is the central role, and Michael O'Hare gives him menacing physical weight. Dolin, the part's creator, was nobly evil; Helpmann, who dominated the role for years, was malevolently beautiful. O'Hare is a worthy successor to these. Surrounding him, we see the serene dances of the angelic host and the brilliantly imagined activities of Job's comforters, the Pestilences and Messengers. (How well de Valois used hands, to point and threaten and mock. With what acute sensibility did she pare away everything except essential gesture and movement. The least action is significant). I admire Alain Dubreuil as Job - ideally simple and dignified - and I salute the entire cast. At curtain fall we cheered Dame Ninette in her grand-tier box, for we owe her everything, and not least her ballets. BRB's triple bill also brought the first London showing of the company's revival of Massine's Choreartium. Eighteen months ago I reported on this brilliant rescue from Birmingham, where it has been splendidly supervised by Tatiana Leskova of the de Basil Ballets Russes. Choreartium was the second of the symphonic ballets with which Massine (and de Basil's company) stormed into the public's heart in 1933. The score is Brahms' fourth symphony, and Massine clothed it with movement that explored its formal procedures, and imbued them with strong if undefined emotion. Surging blocks of activity; a line of women grieving through the second movement; a pastoral interlude; a final outburst of heroics: these are the obvious matters of the piece. More intriguing is Massine's highly subjective - and, be it said, theatrically convincing - response to Brahmsian melody and texture. Because Massine throws himself into the creative process - and drags his cast gloriously in his wake, racing along on the crest of the choreography's feelings - we surrender to the work. It is wild, intensely Russian and, ultimately, exhilarating. To tastes formed by Balanchine's response to music, it is also completely over the top. But its drive and passionate self-confidence (it could be superbly danced by the Bolshoi Ballet) win us. Wednesday's performance was devoted, if a little ragged - the piece needs to be run in during several showings - and BRB's artists deserve much commendation. The new designs by Nadine Baylis, as I have earlier reported, are beautiful, apt. Most important, Mme Leskova's revival is true, and honours Massine's significance to the ballet of our century. My companion was a member of the original cast: she approved whole-heartedly of the staging. This imaginative triple bill (which is being given only three showings) opened with MacMillan's Concerto. It looked clean and clear in production, but it, too, needs a run of performance to polish its rough edges and some uncertain dancing from its soloists. Excellent accounts of three major scores came from the Royal Ballet Sinfonia under Paul Murphy.                          *       *       * English National Ballet, meantime, has taken up summer residence on the South Bank in London. This week, Swan Lake is on offer. (How, I wonder, could things be otherwise). The staging is Raissa Struchkova's recension of the one-time Bolshoi Ballet version, sound and happily traditional. It looks rather boxed in on the Festival Hall's shelf, and it needs stronger central performances than those I saw on Wednesday afternoon from Trinidad Vives and Tamas Solymosi. My greatest pleasure came from the dancing of a corps de ballet swan, who closely resembles the very young Lynn Seymour, moving and posing with the same melting grace. The Birmingham Royal Ballet is at Covent Garden with varied programmes until August 7. English National Ballet is at the Royal Festival Hall with varied programmes until August 7.</p>

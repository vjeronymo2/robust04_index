			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AUSTRALIAN DISPUTES SURFACE PLANNED BY U.S. FOR DAVIS CUP  </P> <P> Australia's Davis Cup captain said today that the clay court surface the United  States plans to use in next month's final may not comply with the rules.  </P> <P> The United States Tennis Assn. announced Thursday that it would use a red  brick-dust surface to be imported from Germany.  </P> <P> But Australia's Neale Fraser said he is not satisfied the surface falls within  the regulations.  </P> <P> The latest move follows the setting of disputed times for the matches to start  and delays in announcing a surface, both of which Neale said exceeded  International Tennis Federation deadlines.  </P> <P> "It appears that the United States has gone for the trifecta," Fraser said.  "First, they delayed announcing the surface. Secondly, they selected  controversial starting times, and now thirdly they have to import the court  surface from Germany."  </P> <P> Davis Cup rules provide that the court surface must have been used in at least  three tournaments in the 1990 men's Grand Prix circuit and be "in general use  for tennis in the country where and when the match is held," according to  Fraser.  </P> <P> Fraser has asked Tennis Australia President Geoff Pollard to seek confirmation  from the ITF that the nominated surface satisfies the "general use"  requirement, given that it needs to be imported from Germany.  </P> <P> Tennis Australia said today that technically, American-style clay is different  from European-style clay, but did not specify in which areas.  </P></p>

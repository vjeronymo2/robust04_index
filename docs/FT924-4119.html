			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / UN agree resolution to send forces under US command to Somalia THE UN Security Council agreed last night on a resolution to send a multinational force under US command to Somalia to disarm warring clans and ensure food aid gets through to the starving, reports Michael Littlejohns at the UN in New York. After private consultations, western diplomats said a text drafted by the US appeared certain to be approved at a Security Council meeting today. China is expected to abstain. About 20,000 US troops could take part in the operation. Heeding African and other third world objections to an overriding role for American troops, the US apparently agreed to accept a substantial degree of UN control. Under the terms of the draft resolution, UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali would have a liaison staff at the force's field headquarters in Somalia and a Security Council commission would monitor the operation. Mr Boutros Ghali would advise the council when he believed a 'secure environment' for humanitarian aid had been created. Normal UN peacekeeping would then take over from the US-led operation. The Indian president of the Security Council said the US-led intervention would not involve financial cost to the UN.</p>

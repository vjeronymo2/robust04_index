			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Proudfoot price fall explained Shares in Alexander Proudfoot yesterday rose 4p to 63p after the board made a statement following the recent decline in the management consultancy's share price, which last week fell over 22 per cent to 59p. Directors said they had noted the recent fall in the shares, but knew of no reason for the decline, save that volumes of dealings in the shares had traditionally been limited and some sales had recently taken place. In September, the shares fell sharply after profits from continuing operations tumbled to Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 13.2m) in the first half of 1993. Proudfoot said yesterday that this position had stabilised and trading had been steady during the second half.</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / International Company News: GM chairman underlines policy of 'profits first' MR Robert Stempel, chairman of General Motors, yesterday underscored the company's sharp change of policy when he said its heavily loss-making North American operations would concentrate on 'profits first' and less on maintaining market share. He also told shareholders at the company's annual meeting that GM now aimed to operate at 100 per cent capacity in 1994, a year ahead of the completion of a North American restructuring announced last December. Analysts reckon GM plants are running on average at little more than 60 per cent capacity. His remarks followed a boardroom coup last month by GM's non-executive directors, unhappy at the management's slow movement in grappling with the North American losses. Mr Stempel was removed from the leadership of a board committee, while his right-hand man, Mr Lloyd Reuss, was replaced as company president by Mr Jack Smith. Since then, the company has greatly accelerated its programme for restructuring North America. Mr Stempel said yesterday the focus had moved from 'market share with profitability' to 'profit first'. GM, which saw its US car market share plunge from around 46 per cent at the start of the 1980s in the face of Japanese competition, has managed to stabilise the total at around 35 per cent - but partly by unprofitable sales to fleet buyers, such as car rental companies. Mr Stempel said the company was pursuing five strategies to improve profits. These included consolidating the number of vehicle 'platforms,' or basic sub-structures, used to make its North American models as well as the number of component sets. It would also intensify its use of the 'lean' manufacturing methods pioneered by Japanese companies. GM was also moving to a system of buying materials for its US manufacturing plants from the cheap suppliers, wherever in the world they might be.</p>

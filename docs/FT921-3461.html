			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Bush abandons plans for car pollution curbs PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday took his re-election campaign to the car-making state of Michigan by announcing that his administration was dropping controversial plans to impose new anti-pollution controls on cars. The administration has decided to abandon a proposed rule which would have required carmakers to fit special canisters designed to catch petrol vapours that escape during refueling - a requirement that would have substantially increased costs. Instead, the Environmental Protection Agency plans to require the installation of vapour traps directly on petrol pumps. President Bush was due to announce the move yesterday during a campaign trip to Detroit. He was also expected to promise to resist congressional pressure for the imposition of tighter fuel efficiency standards on new cars. Michigan is due to vote in a presidential primary on Tuesday, along with the neighbouring state of Illinois. The state numbers many car workers among its voters, and it has been shaken by the massive job cuts recently announced by General Motors. The Bush campaign was also considering running a television advertisement attacking Mr Patrick Buchanan, the president's right wing challenger, for owning a German-built Mercedes car - in contradiction of the protectionist rhetoric Mr Buchanan has used to criticise Mr Bush.</p>

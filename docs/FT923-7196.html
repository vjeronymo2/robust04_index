			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Forestry policy 'needs overhaul' UK GOVERNMENT policy on forestry needs completely overhauling, according to a survey by Timber Growers United Kingdom, which represents private woodland owners. The survey of 341 forest owners with 65,000 hectares (160,000 acres) found 'vacillating' was the most common criticism in an overwhelmingly negative view of the government measures of the past 20 years. Mr Peter Wilson, technical director of TGUK, said that since the 1988 budget changed the tax rules on forestry, traditional commercial planting had dropped to less than 40 per cent of the 1989 level at less than 10,000 hectares. He called for a properly thought out forestry strategy and an end to ad hoc measures. 'Too many mistakes have been made in the past by government imposing solutions that have not worked. This time we must get it right.' The TGUK survey shows that 75 per cent of forestry owners considered their business was not benefitting from any economic upturn and only 13 per cent intended to invest more in the industry.</p>

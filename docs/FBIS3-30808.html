			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak by Andrzej </F> Woyciechowski at the Radio Zet studio in Warsaw; from the "Guest  of Radio Zet" program--live]    [Text] [Woyciechowski] Radio Zet's guest today is Prime  Minister Waldemar Pawlak. Good morning to you.    [Pawlak] Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.    [Woyciechowski] Last night, you said on television that you  had made a decision on Borowski's resignation. Have you already  signed the document, or will you sign it in the future? In  other words, is the decision final?    [Pawlak] Of course, these procedural issues will take some  time yet, but these decisions were made not so much because I  wanted it so but because of declarations by the concerned  persons themselves. I think that the way it is in politics is  that sometimes one knows another politician very well on a  personal level, and we are colleagues in that regard, but when  it comes to the political arrangement, sometimes you have to  take a different path than your colleague, and perhaps this is  what happened in this case. I think this should not have a  bearing on the future or on our mutual relationship, either on a  personal level or on a political one. You simply must  concentrate not just on procedural or personnel issues, but on  specific problems. There are different positions from which one  may approach solving these problems.    [Woyciechowski] A decision on a deputy prime minister's  resignation--is that the kind of decision the prime minister  consults the president about?    [Pawlak, hesitating] Of course, one could think of a number  of different formal obstacles, but I do not think that is the  case here. As far as constitutional provisions are concerned,  the prime minister submits a motion to the president, who signs  it. Naturally, he does not have to sign it; such cases have  occurred under the previous cabinet, but I think it will not  happen in this case.    [Woyciechowski] And now let us talk for a while about  Borowski's successor. This will be decided within the next few  days. How will it happen? Will the Democratic Left Alliance  [SLD] or Kwasniewski suggest a candidate whom he will select  himself and you will then approve automatically, or do you  intend to select a candidate from among several options? In a  word, who will select Borowski's successor--you or the SLD?    [Pawlak] We will talk about that. I cannot say at this point  what will happen, but I do not think the decision will be made  by a single person or by just one side. We will talk about that  together [with the SLD]. I just want to strongly emphasize that  the post and the whole area of issues was reserved for the SLD  under the coalition agreement we signed last year, and I think  we will follow that provision.    [Woyciechowski] Does that mean that you will approve of any  candidate suggested by the SLD?    [Pawlak] We will talk about that. I think both we and they  are eager to see a candidate who is well prepared, who is an  expert on financial issues and on economic policies. In that  case, such a person has a big chance to be selected for the post.    [Woyciechowski] Last night, the SLD leaders said they  already have a good candidate, but they cannot reveal his name  yet. Are you, Mr. Prime Minister, familiar with the name?    [Pawlak] Well, I have not heard about that, either, so let  us wait patiently for a while longer.    [Woyciechowski] Borowski had two posts: deputy prime  minister and finance minister. Will these continue to be  performed by a single person, or will you separate the two posts?    [Pawlak] I really think that to go into detail too much is  a little premature right now. We will talk about th at issue  within the coalition. and then I think we will make a final  decision.    [Woyciechowski] Will these talks take place tonight?    [Pawlak] Yes, talks between the coalition partners are  scheduled to take place tonight, and I think we will discuss  specific issues then. I would like to turn your attention to  the fact that this is not a procedural or personnel problem but  one linked to divisions or different approaches to the reforms.  These divisions or approaches exist within the two parties  themselves. It used to be quite simple. All you had to do was  speak out in favor of this or that kind of political regime, and  this enabled you to become the guardian of the holy fire. But  today, when everyone is in favor of democracy and the free  market, it is no longer the case that you have just one party or  one individual who guarantees that the reforms will not deviate  from the right path. The direction of our reforms was approved  by the entire society. The quality and rate of these  changes--that remains an open issue. The first issue is the  manner in which we reach the goal of a market economy, and these  issues are discussed not only between the parties but also  within the parties. That can be seen from what happened  yesterday. This can be seen in both the SLD and the Polish  Peasant Party [PSL]. I think this is the main and fundamental  problem we are facing now in the entire parliament.    [Woyciechowski] So, if I understand correctly, the issue is  not about personnel changes but more about changes in economic  policies. Will Poland's economic policies be changed with  Borowski's departure?    [Pawlak] I would like to turn your attention to the fact  that the fundamental elements--that is to say, the issue of  financial discipline and the degree to which the budget is  realistic--are equally....[Pawlak pauses] We all attach equal  importance to these issues because they determine the degree to  which our measures are realistic. But different aspects may  receive different degrees of attention; the main investment  directions may receive a different kind of attention. Apart  from the strictly financial or budget-related issues, attention  must also be paid to the budget's impact on both companies and  big social groups.    [Woyciechowski] Mr. Prime Minister, now the last of the  rumors that have been appearing in the papers recently. A few  of the dailies write about that today: Do you take into account  the possibility of a resignation by Minister [and chief of the  Office of the Council of Ministers] Strak?    [Pawlak] Perhaps once he offers his resignation. So far he  has not resigned.    [Woyciechowski] So, in other words, it does not look like he  is going anywhere. Now, a somewhat more serious question: Is  there an alternative to the current coalition?    [Pawlak] I think the election results and the current  parliamentary configuration are responsible for the fact that we  must first look for solutions within the current coalition. I  can see that kind of will and readiness to act in both the PSL  and the SLD. Of course, we cannot find solutions quickly and  easily to all of the issues, but the essence of politics is  about looking for compromise solutions; it is not a zero-balance  game, where, if one wins, the other party must lose completely.  The situation we have is such that, as long as we can come up  with an acceptable compromise and an agreement, we gain much  more in total than in situations where we would decide to butt  our heads together. I think that, while looking for specific  solutions, we will definitely move ahead much faster than by  focusing on procedural issues only. These issues of procedure  and organization-management are important, but they do not  constitute a topic for public debate because they are the  internal business of the various organizations and structures.    [Woyciechowski] That was an extremely diplomatic response.  What you really meant was: No, there is no alternative. But  you began the sentence with the phrase "we must first look for  solutions." When one talks about something being first, that  means there is something second as well, that there is another  some kind of....    [Pawlak, interrupting] You [addressing Woyciechowski] are  always able to read my mind perfectly and then interpret what I  want to say in your own way. I think I will not disturb the  harmony you just introduced.    [Woyciechowski] But the question is: Is there an  alternative to the current coalition? I mean not as of today  but perhaps in six months. Or perhaps there is no alternative  arithmetically speaking, or in terms of party programs, and so  the coalition must continue in its current shape?    [Pawlak] I think for the coalition to continue is the most  likely solution for right now, and I think one should focus on  that, without looking for some kind of strange or exotic  solutions.    [Woyciechowski] When you say exotic solutions, you are  certainly making an allusion to what the press has also been  writing about for a few days now: he possibility of a coalition  among the PSL, the Confederation for an Independent Poland  [KPN], part of the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ], and  the Nonparty Bloc in Support of Reforms [BBWR]. Is my  understanding correct here?    [Pawlak] Well, on that issue, unfortunately you [addressing  Woyciechowski and laughing] are abusing your rights here by  describing these issues according to your own criteria. By the  same token, one could say that some offers made by the  Democratic Union [UD] addressed to the SLD may seem surprising,  in particular because there was a time when declarations were  made [by UD] in no uncertain terms that there would be no  agreement, period. But, as you can see, overcoming prejudices  is possible even between the two parties, and I think it is the  right thing to do since it is about time to put an end to  historical divisions, and it is time to start talking about the  problems. I think that, when one looks at the current  situation, amidst all the emotions linked to all of the  personnel issues, what struck me was that so little attention  was paid to such an important event as the treaty of association  with the EEC, which became effective on 1 February; the signing  of the "Partnership for Peace" that took place on 2 February; or  even the processes that are taking place here in Poland--I mean  the issue of talks between the government and employers on one  hand, and trade unions on the other. These talks are conducted  by Deputy Prime Minister Cimoszewicz and [Labor] Minister Leszek  Miller. During these talks, such issues are debated as the  economic system's fundamental parameters and also the parameters  of the program we will implement in the near future and in the  following years. There was little talk, for instance, about  yesterday's meeting between [Industry and Trade] Minister Pol  and the miners trade unions. I think these--at least the last  two cases I mentioned--are the kinds of events that determine  our ability to conduct talks together and look for solutions.  We talk in a peaceful manner and not through various kinds of  protests or street demonstrations. These are also factors  shaping our reality today. I think we should make a joint  effort so that journalists not only focus on easily visible  sensations but devote at least a little of their time to  significant and serious problems. Perhaps these do not provide  as many emotions as....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] As the case of [recently  dismissed Deputy Finance Minister] Kawalec or of Bank Slaski?    [Pawlak] Or as some cases of ice skating and broken legs  [not further identified]. But these problems are certainly  important, and we must maintain the right proportions or else  what we have then is the impression that, practically speaking,  life at the top is just made up of nothing but sensations, and  those processes that provide fewer emotions and occupy more time  of the people concerned--these are almost completely ignored.  That is also a comment against the background of debates or  criticism concerning the Cabinet's information policies. I  think that to talk about information policies is quite  ridiculous to begin with. That is because I do not think the  point is for the government to organize a press conference every  now and then and to tell stories. If there are no stories to  tell, then, even if the government holds a press conference  every three hours, there will be no one to write or talk about  it or to present it on television. Information policies are  about creating such facts and about focusing attention on such  processes, which are important from the standpoint of society  and the state, and, in that case, I think that even if someone  has bad faith, he simply cannot ignore such issues.    [Woyciechowski] After such an introduction, I must ask you  a very serious question. I will therefore ask you about the  budget. The Council of Ministers will decide today on the final  shape of the budget. Are Minister Kolodziejczyk and Minister  Miller going to get more money?    [Pawlak] Some corrections are envisioned in the budget.  They are the result of the possibility of shifts among various  budget items. They amount to a pretty considerable  sum--approximately 5.5 trillion zlotys. However, there are also  proposals and suggestions on the part of the committees that do  not correspond to real revenues. Therefore, in this situation,  these proposals are difficult to put into effect. The budget  must be based on reality. One cannot plan expenditures as one  wishes. I think that the government has gone to great lengths  to maximize the revenues and to optimize the expenditures as  much as possible. Now, this is an interesting paradox: On the  one hand, we are criticized that this budget is stretched too  tight, and, on the other, we are criticized that it has not used  up all of the reserves and all of the possibilities. I think  this really shows that we have managed to find a solution that  may not be unique, but that is one of the solutions that can be  implemented and that resolves the most fundamental problems.    [Woyciechowski] This means that this budget will stay as it  is? This means that there will be no major change in the  budget? Will there be only cosmetic changes?    [Pawlak] We are all responsible for the solutions that are  in the budget. It is not that one person or one party is the  guarantee of stability and responsibility. We all have this  feeling of both responsibility and reality. Now, as I say, this  budget is not the only... [Pawlak pauses] It definitely is not  the best possible budget. However, it is one of the solutions  that can really be implemented and that definitely resolves a  few problems, such as the problem of lowest retirement and  disability pensions. These solutions were decided on as early  as December of last year. Also the issues related to mining.  We can definitely say that the Ministry of Industry  concentrated on resolving the problems of mining in such a way  as to avoid group layoffs; it also does not want mines to be  closed down en masse. The ministry sees to it that these  processes are implemented smoothly and gently. If a mine is  running out of its underground deposits and must be closed down,  the people working there do not lose their jobs; they are moved  to other mines. These are examples of very concrete solutions  that can be achieved even with the small amount of financial  resources we have at our disposal. They can be achieved if these  resources are concentrated on the areas that must be dealt with  most urgently.    [Woyciechowski] For a few days now, Poland has been a  partner of NATO. It has been a partner for peace. Also for a  few days, NATO generals have been wondering whether the Serb  positions in Sarajevo should be bombarded. Is Poland consulted  about such a NATO decision? Has anyoe tried to consult you  about this problem? Has anyone asked about your opinion on this  matter?    [Pawlak] There have been no such consultations with me yet.  There have not been such consultations on a government level.  If my evaluation of this situation is correct, I get the  impression that these are independent decisions of NATO.  However, if we take a look at the UN Security Council,  differences of opinion are quite noticeable there, and it is not  at all certain whether this particular solution will be put into  effect. Yugoslavia is an example of a very painful and tragic  situation, where the elements of hatred have led to a situation  where probably hardly anyone remembers what exactly started this  conflict, whereas this destructive war is going on. This war is  not of a linear nature--that is, where there is a front line, on  both sides of which there are the two parties. It is of an area  nature: These communities have mixed with one another for a few  dozen years, and now it is difficult to find a way to separate  or reconciliate these fighting parties. First, they should try  to find a solution themselves. Outside intervention in these  processes will certainly not yield a peaceful solution. I  believe that various ideas and solutions are possible here. I  think this depends mainly on the inhabitants of Yugoslavia; it  depends on whether they are able to speak to each other  peacefully.    [Woyciechowski] When is Poland going to negotiate the  details of its partnership in NATO? When will we decide whether  we should place a platoon, a company, or many divisions at the  disposal of NATO?    [Pawlak] We spoke about this when this document was being  signed. I think that, generally speaking, we should focus on  those activities that do not entail any great financial  resources. Neither side has too many superfluous resources that  could be earmarked for these processes. Therefore, most efforts  will probably be concentrated on the elements that are crucial  as far as the possibilities of cooperation are concerned, such  as the systems of information exchange amd compatibility of  managing these complex organisms. Then, regardless of equipment  differences, it will be possible for us to act jointly and to  cooperate....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That means slowly and quietly?    [Pawlak] I think that many things can be done in this area  with the resources that we have right now at the disposal of the  Ministry of National Defense [MON], on condition that they are  spent on establishing such procedures and solutions that are  compatible and that would let us cooperate with our NATO  partners.    [Woyciechowski] When will you sign the appointments of  deputy ministers in the three presidential ministries? Will you  sign them at all? Has the decision been made yet?    [Pawlak] Well, you know, as far as the presidential  ministries are concerned, I can say that I have signed a few  appointments. These were not appointments that were not  discussed and agreed to at the political summit. There were  earlier agreements. As it turns out, they are not always  satisfactory in this broad political dimension; however, it is a  more remote issue, and I think we will be able to find a  solution that is satisfactory to all of our partners.  Nevertheless, this must be done in such a way as to focus on  certain issues; therefore, we should seek people who would  resolve very concrete and important problems; we should not  focus on some symbolic ambitions--that this or that politician  must for a while be in the Ministry of National Defense, the  Ministry of Internal Affairs, or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  because this would fit the political bouquet. Now, returning to  issues related to the Partnership for Peace for a while, I would  like to stress that, since the meeting in Prague, we have been  very consistently proposing a slightly different concept:  partnership for development. I must say that this proposal has  been very favorably received in the West. I believe that it  would be good if we worked on this concept in our country as  well, in order to be able to use the opportunities that are  emerging in all directions; we should also seek partners in  those places where our offers are answered positively. Now, if  we implement the partnership for development--that is, if we  extend the areas of cooperation, especially the areas of  economic cooperation, as well as cultural and political  cooperation--this will provide a permanent basis for the  Partnership for Peace and for enhancing our international  security.    [Woyciechowski] Let us revert to internal affairs for a  while. You are meeting with SLD politicians, including  Kwasniewski, this evening. Will everything be resolved tomorrow  morning in the coalition? Do you think it will be easy to  discuss all of the issues in a few hours? Do you think this  will last long? What kind of attitude have you adopted before  these talks--a very militant one or a slightly compromising one?    [Pawlak] Well, I believe we all really want to find the  right solutions and resolve concrete problems because only then  can we be certain about our political peace and about the  political future. The experience of recent years and the  political configurations in general have shown that peace in  cabinets is not as important as the resolution of the problems  that are crucial from the viewpoint of the people. This is the  best evidence of the efficiency of politicians. I think that at  this coalition meeting we will certainly seek solutions in the  individual, personnel dimension; however, we will first discuss  the strategic activities related to the program of the  functioning of the government and the coalition; we will also  try to point to areas that we should particularly focus on right  now and areas where these resources should be used so that the  best results can be achieved.    [Woyciechowski] What do such talks look like? How do you  and Kwasniewski address each other? Are you very familiar with  him, and do you call him by his first name?    [Pawlak] I think that the recent weeks have had a great  advantage: All of us in the entire parliament were able to get  to know one another. As far as large parts of the Deputies'  Clubs are concerned, we know one another quite well, and we do  not address each other by any titles; we are very  straightforward. This is something I value very highly because,  no matter whether we are in the government camp or in the  opposition, we can speak to one another. This goes not only for  the SLD, but also for all of the other groupings, such as UD,  the BBWR, the KPN, the Union of Labor....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But how do you address  Kwasniewski--by his first name?    [Pawlak] Yes, I do. It would be an exaggeration....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You are said to be a hard and  obstinate politician. Now, could you say a few words about  Kwasniewski's character? What adjectives would you use?    [Pawlak] Well, really, I can speak about myself. However,  as for other people, I believe I should not do what is a  journalist's job.    [Woyciechowski] Today you are not wearing the necktie you  received from Kwasniewski, are you?    [Pawlak] Well, it so happens that it would not really go  very well with this suit.    [Woyciechowski] Are you going to wear it one day?    [Pawlak] I suppose so. We will see what the tie is like.  Perhaps it will be a lucky tie and a lucky solution. I think  this also shows that politics can sometimes be taken not so  seriously. However, in everyday life, probably hardly anyone  realizes that the mental stress accompanying the decisions that  have to be made is often enormous. It must also be remembered  that such decisions require both great caution and the feeling  of responsibility because they concern a lot of people. Here  one simply cannot afford to make a mistake. As a rule, the  decisions must be given a lot of thought; they must at once  start positive processes.    [Woyciechowski] In other words, you have given a lot of  thought to the recent decisions. On the day you signed  Kawalec's resignation, did you know what would happen next? Was  this scenario easy to predict? Or did you not know it at that  time?    [Pawlak] It is certainly not possible to predict all of the  consequences that a given decision may cause, and I do not think  that...    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But you did take such  developments into account, did you not?    [Pawlak] I must frankly admit that I did not think there was  such a danger; I also thought that the decisions that followed  were neither necessary nor desirable. I think this affair could  have been resolved in another way.    [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the interview.    [Pawlak] Thank you.</p>

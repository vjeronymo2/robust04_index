			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / International Company News: A triumph of hope over experience - The background to United Airlines' employee ownership deal Is the USA in the grip of a workers' revolution? You might think so, to look at what is happening to its airlines. One by one, they are succumbing to employee ownership. At the end of last week United Airlines, the biggest US carrier, and its labour unions agreed a deal which - if ratified by shareholders and union members - will give employees up to 63 per cent of the company's shares in return for Dollars 5bn worth of savings in labour costs. It is the most spectacular so far in a series of similar deals. Earlier this year Trans World Airlines agreed to give employees 45 per cent of its shares in return for Dollars 660m worth of labour cost savings, and Northwest Airlines agreed a plan giving employees up to 37.5 per cent of the company's equity in return for Dollars 886m worth of concessions. Nor is the United deal unlikely to be the last. Mr Robert Crandall, chairman and chief executive of American Airlines, the second biggest US carrier, has already said he would welcome a share ownership proposal from his employees. Delta Air Lines and USAir may not be far behind. The simple explanation for this phenomenon is the big airlines' desperate need to cut costs. Smaller carriers like Southwest Airlines are transforming domestic air travel in the US into a no-frills commodity business in which only the lowest-cost carriers can compete. The big airlines have been fighting back by trying to cut their labour costs, which represent their biggest single operating expense. Thousands of jobs have already gone: now the carriers want to cut remaining employees' pay and make them work harder by changing working practices. Not surprisingly, employees are unenthusiastic about the prospect and their heavily-unionised status gives them the power to resist attempts to impose changes unilaterally - as demonstrated by last month's strike by American Airlines' flight attendants. Carriers are therefore trying to buy employees' compliance by offering them equity stakes in their companies equal to the net present value of the savings expected to flow from their sacrifices. Even then, it is not proving easy. Northwest only reached agreement with its unions when it was on the brink of bankruptcy. TWA was already bankrupt, and only won a deal because it formed part of a 'do-or-die' rescue plan. United looks different: it is nowhere near bankruptcy, yet has won what appear to be vast concessions from its unions. In return, however, it has had to yield so many shares to its employees that they will effectively control the company. Will the result be drastic changes at United? One early consequence is that Mr Stephen Wolf, the company's 52-year-old chairman and chief executive, is likely to step aside. Mr Wolf has already hinted at his desire to move on when the deal is done, and the unions want to replace him with 58-year-old Mr Gerald Greenwald, a former vice-chairman of Chrysler. In other respects, however, much the same management will go on running the company in much the same way. The employee representatives will have the power to veto decisions on extraordinary matters such as big acquisitions or disposals. However, as with Northwest and TWA, they will have only two or three seats out of 12 or 13 on the board, so they will not be in a position to dictate corporate strategy. Rather, the intended effect is more subtle. As with other employee share ownership plans, the management's hope is that employees who have tied up a sizeable piece of their net worth in the business will be more inclined to drop confrontational attitudes and work harder for the company's success. At TWA, for example, flight crews have been giving up their spare time to take part in promotional tours for the airline around US travel agencies. Yet the idea seems a triumph of hope over experience. Largely as a result of a boom in employee share ownership plans during the 1980s, about 10,000 US companies are partly owned by their employees. It has yet to be conclusively shown, however, that companies that have employee ownership perform better than those that do not. Significantly, the US airline industry has been here before. In the mid-1980s, when the industry faced similar troubles, employees acquired 9 per cent of Continental Airlines, 11 per cent of Trans World Airlines, 13 per cent of Pan American World Airways, 15 per cent of Republic Airlines, 15 per cent of Pacific Southwest Airlines, 25 per cent of Eastern Airlines and 33 per cent of Western Airlines - in all cases trading wage concessions for equity. They also acquired substantial shareholdings in People Express and America West. Ominously, it did not appear to help: all nine companies went bankrupt or succumbed to takeovers. If United's plan is to prove revolutionary, it will have to do better than that.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LARGEST US COMPANIES (BY MARKET VALUE) WITH EMPLOYEE SHARE OWNERSHIP PLANS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                                   % of shares                                         held in Esops  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Procter &amp; Gamble                                   13 Atlantic Richfield                                 10 Phillips Petroleum                                 24 Allied Signal                                      16 Lockheed                                           19 Ashland Oil                                        23 Textron                                            20 Colgate Palmolive                                  10 Boise Cascade                                      15 Avis                                               96 FMC                                                25 Corning                                            12 Diamond Shamrock                                   13 Stanley Works                                      28 Polaroid                                           20  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: The Esop Association  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

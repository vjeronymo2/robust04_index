			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Unionists keen on bilateral talks ULSTER UNIONISTS could be ready to take part in talks on Mr John Major's proposed new peace initiative as long as Westminster does not insist on a round-table format for the discussions. Senior Ulster Unionist party MPs indicated yesterday they would discuss whatever proposals ministers put forward in bilateral meetings. Mr James Molyneaux, the party's leader, was yesterday still declining to comment on the initiative, but ministers have drawn comfort from what they see as the measured nature of his reaction. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, appeared willing earlier this week to go along with a bilateral approach - at least in the early stages of new talks. But he seemed to view this as a preliminary to further round-table discussions. Bilateral talks, he said, could be a way to 'bank what is bankable from last time and to see what ultimately is a really serious obstacle. Then may be the time to sit around the table.' A more serious barrier to a resumption of talks may come from the Democratic Unionists. Their leader, the Reverend Ian Paisley, again insisted yesterday that Mr John Hume, the Social Democratic and Labour party leader, must end his talks with Mr Gerry Adams, head of Sinn Fein. 'Mr Hume has to say that his talks with Gerry Adams are over,' Mr Paisley said. 'And until Dublin deals with Articles 2 and 3 (of its constitution which covers its claim to the North) there is no point in sitting down with them.' Mr Paisley said the DUP was waiting for Mr Major's response to its proposals for 'breaking the logjam'. He said these dealt with both the cross-border relationship with Dublin and internal institutional questions in the province. According to Mr John Taylor, the Ulster Unionist's spokesman on Europe, the British government should try to seize the initiative by discussing its plan in bilateral meetings with the province's four constitutional parties and then moving ahead to implement it. Mr Taylor believes the plan's main elements should be the creation of a Northern Ireland assembly to administer laws that would continue to be made at Westminster and the formulation of 'some new basis of co-operation' between Belfast and Dublin. If these structures could be made to work, he would expect the effectiveness of the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement - which his party opposes for giving Dublin influence over part of the UK - to wither. The Ulster Unionists' influence at Westminster has been strengthened by the fragility of Mr Major's Commons majority.</p>

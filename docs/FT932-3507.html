			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Construction Contracts: London airport scheme BOVIS PROGRAM MANAGEMENT (BPM) is providing construction management and design expertise on the building of BAA's new 400,000 sq ft Terminal 1 airside development at Heathrow. BPM, a division of the P&amp;0 company Bovis Construction, and architects Richard Rogers Partnership have been brought together for the first time in this way to create the facility which is due for a phased completion by December 1995. There are three different aspects to the project. A new Pounds 20m purpose-built flight connections centre aims to attract transfer passengers by offering tailor-made services under one roof. An enlarged international departure lounge at Terminal 1 will enable passengers to take advantage of catering areas and 56,000 sq ft of retail space. The lounge will have seating accommodation for 1,400 and first class and business class airline lounges. The third improvement involves the replacement of the baggage handling system with fully automated equipment which will include facilities for the handling and storage of transfer baggage. This will allow smooth handover from one airline to another and one terminal to another.</p>

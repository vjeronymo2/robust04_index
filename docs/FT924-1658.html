			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Japan to slow banks' stock market move THE Japanese government is likely to slow the planned entry of banks into the securities industry in an attempt to give the country's ailing brokerages a chance to recover from the Tokyo market collapse. Negotiations continued last night among Finance Ministry officials on the details of a reform package to be announced today or tomorrow, but it is expected that banks will be restricted to the sale and underwriting of bonds. The government originally intended that the reforms, due to be introduced from next April, would allow the banks, through new securities subsidiaries, to underwrite stocks and play a gradually larger role in stock trading. However, strong lobbying by brokers, most of which reported large losses in the first half to September, and by friendly politicians in the ruling Liberal Democratic party has forced the ministry to slow the reform programme. In return for banks' entry into the bond market, Japanese securities houses, through subsidiaries, are likely to be allowed to enter trust banking and be given more freedom in dealing in currency products. Finance Ministry officials insist that they have not abandoned the principle of deregulation, but that the difficult circumstances in the broking industry have forced a review of financial reforms. The slowing of the reform programme could draw criticism from the US and EC, which have encouraged Japan to remove the barriers between the banking and securities industry and to provide greater freedom for foreign institutions. Mr Sakae Kudo, chairman of the Japan Securities Dealers' Association, said yesterday the securities markets were already too competitive, and reforms should be delayed until the stock market improved, giving brokers a better chance of succeeding in new banking businesses. Allowing banks to enter bond-related business will provide more competition for the larger Japanese brokers, but will have a limited impact on smaller brokers, which are heavily reliant on stock commissions for their income.</p>

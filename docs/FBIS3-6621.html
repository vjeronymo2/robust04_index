Shinseito  representative Ichiro Ozawa and DSP General Secretary Takashi  Yonezawa attended the meeting, and the parties agreed that "the  coalition parties should endeavour to form a new party, rather  than try to rely on electoral cooperation of existing parties,  to fight in the general election conducted under the new  electoral system."    Even though they are said to have not discussed specific  steps to form the new party, this development shows that Ozawa's  work of forming a new party -- which comes in the wake of the  idea of Shinseito and the JNP forming an alliance -- is  continuing, and this move is likely to send ripples to the new  Sakigake [Harbinger] Party and the Social Democratic Party of  Japan [SDPJ].    The meeting, which took place in a restaurant in Tokyo, was  called by Shinseito and the JNP to discuss the issue of forming  an alliance of all parties in the coalition and Prime Minister  Hosokawa's idea on forming a policy study commission. Present  at the meeting from the DSP were, in addition to Yonezawa, five  lower house members and five upper house members, including  floor whip Atsushi Kanda and Hiroshi Nakai, chairman of the  party Election Strategy Committee. Among those from the JNP was  Dietman Hiroyuki Nagahama. From Shinseito, Ozawa and Dietman  Naoto Kitamura were present. An independent Diet member, Toshio  Yamaguchi, was also there.    According to Yonezawa, the meeting that the SDPJ's position  of wanting to fight the next general election, retaining the  existing parties but cooperating in the election, "has  limitations in fighting the Liberal Democratic Party" and that  "the only way to maintain the government is to form a new party  and campaign with new platforms."    But there were also opinions that "it might be difficult for  all ruling parties to merge into one party in one big sweep" and  also those saying, "We should be cautious about this matter  since this idea of forming a new party or a new unified alliance  can create a big stir."</p>

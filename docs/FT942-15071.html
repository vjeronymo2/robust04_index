			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / International Company News: Skandia eases voting rights limits Skandia, the Swedish insurer, is to ease controversial restrictions on shareholder voting rights. The move is partly in response to pressure from Swedish institutional shareholders who had threatened to boycott a SKr2.8bn (Dollars 354m) rights issue. The move installs the principle of one share, one vote, for the first time in the company's 140-year history. This is subject to an overall limit, however, as shareholders will be unable to vote for more than 5 per cent of the shares represented at a general meeting. Under the old system, dating from 1855, shareholders were restricted to a maximum of 30 votes, however big their stake. The restriction played a crucial role in fending off a hostile bid from two other Scandinavian insurers. More recently, several of Skandia's big institutional shareholders have been demanding more say in the group's affairs.</p>

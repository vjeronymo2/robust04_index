			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / International Company News: No plans for an M&amp;A takeover - Rumours of a power struggle between Deutsche Bank and Morgan Grenfell are unfounded, Ronaldo Schmitz tells David Waller Mr John Craven, chairman of Morgan Grenfell, the London-based merchant bank bought by Deutsche Bank in January 1990, can rest assured: Ronaldo Schmitz, head of corporate finance at Deutsche and chief of its expanding North American operations, is not trying to wrest control of the UK merchant banks's mergers and acquisitions activities. 'It is not true,' Mr Schmitz says, rejecting local press reports that he and Mr Craven are engaged in a power struggle in the boardroom of Germany's biggest bank. The rumours have been lent credence by the fact that Mr Schmitz's team - rather than Morgan Grenfell - has advised on a number of recent prominent mergers and acquisitions in Germany, including the DM1.45bn (Dollars 1.02bn) acquisition of the non-paper businesses of Feldmuhle Nobel by the Metallgesellschaft mining and engineering group last year. 'There may be other cases in the future where due to specific client circumstances, the bank does the advisory work,' Mr Schmitz concedes, 'but this is not to imply that there is competition between my department and Morgan Grenfell. M &amp; A is Morgan Grenfell's field, and if we do the odd transaction here and there, that does not mean that we are making specific inroads into Morgan Grenfell's domain.' Moreover, he says, a fusion of Morgan Grenfell's M &amp; A activities with those of Deutsche would be counter-productive: 'Given the size differential, Morgan Grenfell would eventually be crushed, its pure M &amp; A culture would be contaminated.' Mr Schmitz and Mr Craven have much in common. They are about the same age (Schmitz is 54 next month, Craven 52, also next month) and both joined the bank in 1990. Schmitz arrived after 23 years at BASF, the large German chemicals company, where he was finance director from 1984. They are the the only two of Deutsche's 13-strong main board who have not spent their entire working lives at the bank. The Brazilian-born Mr Schmitz can also claim to be the only board member to have had experience of being a bank's corporate customer. Highly regarded in the international financial community, he left BASF only after losing out in the race to succeed Mr Hans Albers as chief executive. Given his background, Mr Schmitz is well-placed to comment on the often controversial relations between the Deutsche Bank and German industry. A network of large industrial holdings (notably the 28 per cent direct stake in Daimler Benz, Germany's largest industrial group), combined with the seats taken by Deutsche Bank directors on the supervisory boards of dozens of big companies, often gives the impression that the bank tells German industry what to do, rather than the other way round. 'If the number of supervisory board memberships we have relays the picture of a very significant power being wielded by the Deutsche Bank, it is wrong,' Mr Schmitz says. 'Even the treasurers of very small companies give us a very hard time. If you look at the companies we have a stake in, and how they behave when seeking a bank service, they play us off against our competitors whether or not we are on the board. It would be short-sighted or even foolish to try to gain business via our board members. 'As for the stakes themselves, many were acquired decades ago as a result of underwriting exercises - rather than as the result of any conscious investment decisions. The result is that the bank is close to a number of industries and in order to protect its investments it has to understand the companies involved. This adds a lot of value and intelligence to what we do.' On commercial grounds, Mr Schmitz thinks that the industrial holdings should be sold, as the proceeds could be better invested elsewhere. However he says that in practice this is impossible, for tax reasons. The extensive cross-holdings often serve to protect German companies from the threat of takeover, a threat further reduced by voting restrictions which curb shareholders' influence over the companies in which they have stakes. A good example is the Continental tyre company, where Deutsche and Morgan Grenfell have played a controversial role in preventing Pirelli exercising its full voting rights. Mr Schmitz believes that the best defence for company management - in Germany as elsewhere - is 'aggressive management of the business combined with an open information policy'. But he says that Deutsche will not abandon its own shareholder voting restrictions until Germany has international standards of disclosure and takeover rules. If the bank cannot wash its hands of its corporate investments, it can participate in the process of disintermediation, which in Germany is slowly leading to a reduction of German companies' traditional dependence on bank finance. Mr Schmitz points to the bank's central role in the founding of the German commercial paper market last year. This market has grown rapidly to become the fourth largest in Europe, with the total value of programmes likely to rise to DM50bn by the end of the year. As head of the 274-person strong corporate finance department, Mr Schmitz has twin priorities. One is to develop the bank's financial structuring activities - 'using our financial engineering skills as opposed to marketing commodity capital market products, an area which is becoming increasingly competitive day by day'. The other is to develop the bank's equity business across the whole of Europe: 'Here in Germany we are an equities powerhouse, but not outside Germany, and this has to change.' His other main management responsibility is North America, where the bank employs more than 1,000 people and has tripled its assets to Dollars 14bn since 1990. Here, he says, 'there have never been better opportunities for foreign banks than at present . . . we have a strong balance sheet and so we can say that we are ready to lend - a rare commodity in North America these days, so it opens doors for us. But we are hoping to do far more than plain vanilla lending'. The change from industry to banking has not been traumatic, he says. The people are equally dedicated, the management issues similar. The big difference is, of course, working with money rather than chemicals. 'Chemicals smell, money doesn't,' he quips.</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HARD-PRESSED STATES RAISE TAXES BY $7.6 BILLION IN '90  </P> <P> States increased taxes by an estimated $7.6 billion during 1990 legislative  sessions, pushed by higher costs for schools, prisons and health care, a study  released today said.  </P> <P> In its annual survey of state budgets, the National Conference of State  Legislatures said it expected state finances to continue to deteriorate in the  coming year.  </P> <P> "State balances fell throughout fiscal 1990 and for most states -- including  all the larger states -- are now dangerously low," the group said.  </P> <P> "The national average balance fell from 4.5% of expenditures at the end of  fiscal 1989 to 4% at the end of fiscal 1990 and is expected to fall to 2.3% by  the end of fiscal 1991," it said.  </P> <P> Those balances are considered indicators of state fiscal conditions, and many  states try to maintain a balance of 5% of general fund spending. The balance is  considered a cushion against emergencies for states required by law or  constitution to have balanced budgets.  </P> <P> The NCSL released its report at its annual meeting being held this week in  Nashville, Tenn.  </P> <P> The report said many state fiscal conditions weakened during the last year.  Northeast and New England states were the hardest hit.  </P> <P> Tax increases were passed in 23 states. Those tax increases are expected to  increase revenue by $7.6 billion in fiscal 1991, an increase of 2.6% of state  tax collections.  </P> <P> The study said spending for Medicaid, education and corrections grew faster  than general state revenue. Medicaid spending grew at a 25% annual rate,  putting pressure on state budgets.  </P> <P> Of the three major types of taxes, 10 states increased personal income taxes,  the report said. Ten raised corporate income taxes, and 17 raised sales and use  taxes.  </P> <P> The biggest tax increases were in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Florida, New York,  Kentucky and Texas.  </P> <P> Other states raising taxes were Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode  Island, Vermont, Delaware, Ohio, Kansas, Nebraska, Alabama, Louisiana,  Tennessee, Virginia, Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Washington.  </P> <P> New Jersey's increase totaled $2.2 billion, or 21% of 1989 revenue, the report  said. Massachusetts' increase was $1.16 billion, or 12.8%, and Florida's was  $1.09 billion, or 8.7%, the report said.  </P> <P> States listed as lowering taxes were Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, South Carolina,  Utah and Hawaii. All of the decreases were small, the report said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROFESSORS ADORE/ABHOR PUPILS, REVERE/REGRET THEIR OWN CALLING  </P> <P> This month the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching issued the  results of a survey of 5,000 college and university professors. Professors were  asked to appraise their students and their jobs (not the same thing). The  results: Johnny can't read. We knew that. Johnny is a bore. Did we know that?  </P> <P> Undergraduates are unwilling to work hard, doing just enough work to get by.  Students are more grade-conscious now -- and more likely to cheat.  </P> <P> Responding professors, 64% of them, agree with the survey statement that "many  students ill-suited to academic life are now enrolling in colleges and  universities."  </P> <P> We should be as wary of despairing opinions among adults regarding youth as we  are wary of the reverse. Children are both critics and heirs. In either case,  our perception of their behavior ought to tell as much about us as about them.  </P> <P> My own generation -- the one that went to college in the 1960s -- was famous  for proclamations of freedom. We were free -- of parents and grandparents and  government and corporations and all that stuff. Suddenly the Winter Palace was  overturned. We were our own teachers. History hadn't worked. "Don't trust  anyone over 30."  </P> <P> The '60s generation was conceived during the postwar years -- the baby boom.  Far from being free of history, we were tied to history by birth, a biological  continuation of the species after cataclysm. During the war our parents had  seen the world nearly destroyed. And after the war, a blanket of optimism, the  necessary hypocrisy, was thrown over the obscene memory. America rewarded  knowledge of evil with a GI Bill that would transform higher education into  mass education.  </P> <P> The generation of the 1960s, having presumed to overturn history, is not now  resigned to being itself overturned. Our authority was our youth. We undermined  our authority by growing old. Haven't our children noticed some hypocrisy?  </P> <P> The faculty members surveyed by Carnegie identify themselves on a 5-point scale  as "moderately liberal." They perceive their students as "conservative" --  politically conservative and conservative in life style.  </P> <P> About 84% of the professors believe "undergraduates have become more careerist  in their concerns."  </P> <P> I taught freshman English as a graduate student during the late-1970s. I  remember lecturing a class about Hamlet while at the back of the room, several  premed students studied biochemistry behind propped-up Shakespeares. What did  my class matter when there was a "real" course to follow? Who had time for  soliloquies?  </P> <P> The new careerism was a rejection of the romantic rhetoric of the 1960s.  Student of the late-'70s saw clearly enough that the '60s radical was enrolled  in law school now, that the anti-war activist had become an aerobics superstar.  </P> <P> The romance of the 1960s was that higher education should be made available to  groups of people who had never reached it before. What the next generation had  to realize was that a degree was worth less than before. To distinguish oneself  in the 1970s one needed a degree beyond college. Law. Medicine.  </P> <P> I heard teachers in the 1970s -- I was one of them -- disdain the new  careerism. The young, discovering pragmatism, had turned us into what we  thought we would never be: just another generation.  </P> <P> One of the few things the young seem to have kept from us is rock music. They  hear its beauty and its darkness. What grandmother understood -- that the world  can be disrupted -- today's young take for granted. They accept despair calmly,  through the earphones of their Walkmans. Talk to undergraduates. They're not  interested in George Bush or Michael S. Dukakis; they care little for left or  right. They are more likely to be environmentalists. They can imagine incipient  tragedy larger even than their grandparents remembered. There is literally a  hole in the future, somewhere over the pole.  </P> <P>  "I am apprehensive about the future of this country," so agreed 63% of the  professors.  </P> <P>  When I left graduate school, I was scandalized to discover that many adults  could not read or write -- I mean adults who had been to college, men and women  who worked in banks and elementary schools. My first job was to revise the  everyday correspondence of businessmen. One of the men who employed me was a  Yale graduate with the language skills of a grammar school student.  </P> <P> America keeps its secret, but "basic skills" may be rarer in this age of mass  education than anyone cares to admit. Basic skills may even be irrelevant. Who  knows? Perhaps Peggy Noonan knows. The most powerful men and women in America  routinely pay a Peggy Noonan to write what they will say.  </P> <P> I know teachers who cannot write; I know others who insist that if you cannot  write clearly, you cannot think clearly.  </P> <P> During the ferociously democratic 1960s, I noticed a loss of confidence among  certain professors. They seemed afraid of the implication of their role. One  insisted that students call him by his first name. Another rejected the idea of  grades. His solution was to give all A's.  </P> <P> In those years, some students believed a classroom should reduce to commerce:  "I'm paying for this," the student reminded the university. As teachers  inflated grades, student assumed the right to evaluate professors, as one would  evaluate an employee.  </P> <P> Two decades later, the faculty members polled by the Carnegie Foundation  complain about "grade inflation" at American colleges and universities.  </P> <P> About 62% of the professors admit that grade inflation is a "problem at my  institution." Are they talking about the teacher down the hall or their own  classroom?  </P> <P> There has been a "widespread lowering of standards in American higher  education," say 67% of the educators. Lowering of which standards, and by whom?  </P> <P> Many faculty members admit that they spend little time attending meetings of  the faculty senate. Many have never participated on an administrative  committee. These same professors complain about the "autocratic administration  of their schools."  </P> <P> In the 1960s, affirmative action was the hot issue on campus. Many professors  wouldn't engage the issue publicly. And all questions of affirmative action  were relegated to "the administration." Today's difficult issue is the canon --  are there texts, dates, memories, all American student should know in common?  Again the professors fret privately. But at prominent universities students  have already been offered the option: you decide.  </P> <P> Among Carnegie respondents, 77% would make the same job choice if given the  chance anew. But 44% say they would like the option of early retirement. Like  many other Americans, most professors think they receive a "good" salary but  not an "excellent" one.  </P> <P> Despite the criticism of undergraduate careerism, there is something careerist  about this enterprise. The survey reduces the complex experience of teaching to  numb-skull assertions: "I enjoy interacting informally with undergraduates --  agree, neutral, disagree." Check one. The language belongs to the rating game,  less opportunity for nuance than on a tax form. Carnegie posits teaching as a  job, not a vocation, and that may be the truth.  </P> <P> Our professors say they are pessimistic about their students. They also say  they are content with their jobs. They feel decisions are being made without  their say. They are disappointed with the young. They like working with the  young. Our professors, for all their degrees, agrees and disagrees, end up  sounding so much like other Americans.  </P></p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Nunn flexes his muscles but keeps his cool SENATOR Sam Nunn was in a magnanimous mood on television yesterday morning. He said of President Bill Clinton: 'I admire him greatly, I think he's going to be a terrific leader.' They might disagree on the admission of homosexuals to the US military but the views on both sides were 'sincerely held' and there ought to be no spill of animosity into other important issues. 'Contrary,' he added, 'to what you may have read.' For Mr Clinton, this was a useful olive branch from a fellow-Democrat who has emerged as his first and biggest opponent in Washington. Mr Nunn made clear he would oppose any Republican attempts to codify the existing ban on homosexuals by tagging an amendment to this effect on to the popular family leave bill. Later in the morning he so voted in the Senate. But what the senator from Georgia, chairman of the armed services committee, gives he can also take away. He had enough to say yesterday to serve a warning to the president not to commit the cardinal sin - failure to consult. Joint protestations to the contrary, there are many in Washington who do think bad blood exists between the senator and the president. Mr Nunn, a proud man and sometimes dour, is assumed to have harboured presidential ambitions of his own, now damped down by the arrival of another southern Democrat in the White House. He was never the warmest supporter of Mr Clinton during the presidential election last year, absenting himself from the campaign in his home state at the height of the Gennifer Flowers affair last spring. In the early summer, when Mr Clinton was running third behind President George Bush and Mr Ross Perot in the polls, Mr Nunn did not exactly discourage speculation that he might be available as a compromise candidate. Mr Clinton has a long political memory. His preference for Congressman Les Aspin over Mr Nunn for the post of secretary of defence in the new administration may well have been influenced by presumed slights from the senator, as well as by knowledge of the difficulties he might have with Mr Nunn in the Pentagon over gays in the military and the more pressing questions of defence budget cuts and reorganising the armed services. Mr Nunn's views on both issues - and his close relationship with General Colin Powell, head of the joint chiefs of staff and a formidable political operator in his own right - will still create problems for the president in the months ahead. Yesterday, Mr Nunn was more inclined to change the subject, commending Mr Clinton's renewed focus on economic and social policy issues. Still, he warned that any economic stimulus in the US had to be accompanied by commensurate deficit reduction proposals over the longer term, and he preferred putting higher taxes on social security pensions to suspending cost-of-living adjustments. Even on the issue of gays in the military, on which his committee is to hold hearings soon, he warned: 'I may take into account things I have not yet thought about.' In the present mood, that is about as much as Mr Clinton could have expected.</p>

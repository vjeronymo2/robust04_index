			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Letter: Trade route through Turkey Sir, Mr Steve LeVine is not entirely accurate when he says that Armenia's efforts to find a trade route through Turkey have been hampered by that country's long enmity with Armenia ('Armenia battles on two fronts,' April 7). In fact a certain amount of trade from the Caucasus and central Asia has already reached the outside world through the Turkish Black Sea port of Trabzon. Since Armenia declared its independence nearly two years ago, Turkey has worked hard at building up good relations with this country. This involved a good deal of pragmatism, not least since it is only few years since Armenian terrorists gunned down more than 40 Turkish diplomats, members of their families, and staff in cold blood in cities across the world. Some of the Armenian leadership have welcomed Turkey's attitude. Turkey watches with concern the Armenian attacks which began in Nagorno-Karabakh and later escalated in other parts of Azberbaijani territories, and wishes the killings and the bloodshed to be stopped immediately. In spite of this, it is hard to find anyone in Ankara who does not believe that there is much more to be gained by co-operation, including trade, with Armenia.

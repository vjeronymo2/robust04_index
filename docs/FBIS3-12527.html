In an interview with Qobi  Meydan today, Guzofsky said the present government and Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin should be toppled.    [Begin recording] [Guzofsky] Support should be mustered for  the removal of Yitzhaq Rabin from government. Definitely.    [Meydan] You do not rule out the physical option.    [Guzofsky] I do not know what you mean by physical: Putting  a bullet in his head? Is that what you mean?    [Meydan] I was just asking.    [Guzofsky] You were just asking. I think that, so far, the  actions of Kahana Hay in Israel, the United States, and  throughout the world have been within the law. In Israel, the  rules are different because Yitzhaq Rabin and the fools in  government are preventing Kahana Hay and Kakh from operating  legally and democratically. So they should not be surprised  afterward.    [Meydan] Do I hear a threat?    [Guzofsky] I did not make a threat. I am merely saying that  when a regime prevents its people from electing freely and when  it prevents the Kahana Hay and Kakh people from being elected,  they should not ask afterward why we act undemocratically.

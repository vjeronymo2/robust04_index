			<p>BFN     [Text] The leader of the Russian Communist Party Gennadiy  Zyuganov, a Duma member, doubts that a civic peace accord will  be signed on April 28, the signing date set by President  Yeltsin. He declared in an interview with Interfax on Saturday  that many lawmakers would not sign the document offered by the  auditing group. The draft consists of three warnings,  unacceptable for many: do not touch, as Zyuganov put it, those  who are in power and those who led the country to this state, do  not touch the constitution, pulled through by one third of the  votes, and forget everything that happened in Moscow on October  3-4.    In return, he said, we are promised not to be insulted, but  the opposition is not guaranteed the possibility of using media,  above all television. This is a straight jacket rather than  terms, Zyuganov believes.    In his words, the communist faction in the Duma has  formulated basic terms conditions for civic concord and is ready  to submit them early next week. These terms include a demand to  change the economic course, leading to a social disaster.    The communists also insist on forming a national trust  government, comprising representatives of the various political  forces that won the elections on December 12. The current  government, Zyuganov said, was formed by one force - first by  Russia's Choice and then somewhat expanded at the expense of  Unity and Concord Party, which is represented in the cabinet by  Deputy Premiers Sergey Shakhray and Aleksandr Shokhin.    Besides, as Zyuganov argues, the document must spell out  urgent measures to curb the crime, index pensions, compensate  for depreciated bank savings, and pay wages.</p>

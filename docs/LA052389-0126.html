			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSONAL HEALTH;  </P> <P> SIZING UP DIET CAMPS;  </P> <P> THEY'RE COSTLY RETREATS FOR OVERWEIGHT KIDS, BUT DO THEY GET TO THE HEART OF  THE PROBLEM?  </P> <P> They arrive with swim suits, sandals and a shared dream: to begin the new  school year svelte shadows of their former selves.  </P> <P> Welcome to the world of weight-loss camps for kids, where the unspoken motto is  simple -- "Have fun, lose pounds." In body-conscious Southern California,  business appears to be booming with at least eight such camps now preparing for  the upcoming summer season. Most offer sessions from two to eight weeks and  promise weekly losses of three or more pounds. Some are coed with campers as  young as 8; others are segregated by gender and offer separate programs for  preteens, teens and young adults.  </P> <P> That business is brisk is no surprise given that children and teens have been  steadily expanding in numbers and girth. The American Academy of Pediatrics  estimates up to 30% of children and adolescents in the U.S. exceed the healthy  height-weight range recommended by government guidelines.  </P> <P> But not everyone agrees that sending a plump preteen or adolescent to camp is  the best solution to a weight problem. Programs that stress rapid weight loss  and don't have intensive parental involvement can be counterproductive, said  Laurel Mellin, a registered dietitian who directs the Center for Adolescent  Obesity at the UC San Francisco School of Medicine. She worries about programs  that don't get to the root of obesity, which could spring from depression, too  much television viewing or family problems. Another potential danger is weight  yo-yoing, added Mellin, who believes overweight kids should lose no more than a  pound a week.  </P> <P> Other experts say the camps are too expensive, costing from $600 to $850 a week  in Southern California, compared to weekly fees of $480 and $550 at two  traditional camps. And when it comes to keeping weight off, a day camp approach  -- offering many of the same tools at a fraction of the charge -- may be a  better bet, note other weight control specialists.  </P> <P> Advocates of the resident camp approach maintain campers are bound to lose  weight when exposed to healthful menus and lots of physical activity. Fees are  higher, they point out, because of highly trained staffs which usually include  a doctor on call and a nurse and nutritionist on 24-hour duty.  </P> <P> Schedules vary from camp to camp, but the daily agenda at Camp Murrieta, a San  Diego weight-loss camp for girls is fairly typical. The wake-up call is at 6:30  a.m., followed by breakfast and an exercise session of walking, jogging or  running. After lunch there are group rap sessions, nutrition classes, field  trips and a late-afternoon aerobics class.  </P> <P> "We have speakers talk about hair care; we have drama, arts and crafts and  other classes," said camp director David Kempton. After dinner, he added,  there's time to socialize.  </P> <P> Most campers come with 20 or 30 pounds to lose, say directors, but most accept  normal weight participants as well.  </P> <P> Whatever the goal, menus are carefully controlled. Both Camp California, near  Santa Barbara, and Camp Ojai, run by Weight Watchers, follow the program's diet  plan, which allows choices of foods from different categories, said Tony  Sparber, the camps' executive director. The menus at Camp Murrieta and Camp Del  Mar, also directed by Kempton, are patterned after guidelines established by  the American Dietetic and American Heart associations.  </P> <P> Other camps teach how to count calories. At Camp Camelot in Whittier, for  instance, boys are limited to about 1,500 per day; girls, 1,200. The approach,  said director Michele Friedman, is based on a meal plan adopted by the New York  City Board of Health.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Goodies Banned  </P> <P> Some camps prohibit marshmallows and other traditional goodies; others do not.  At Castleview Camps, opening a new site in San Diego this summer, popcorn will  be substituted for marshmallows, said Jim Denniston, executive director.  </P> <P> Reasoning that kids need to learn moderation, Kempton prefers to introduce  foods like marshmallows and ice cream, "because we want (campers) to know  nothing's forbidden."  </P> <P> To test campers' resolve in the real world, "We take them to the movies and  Universal Studios, where there are high-calorie temptations," Friedman of Camp  Camelot said. If they cave in and get ice cream, it must be counted in the  calorie tally. "They have to learn thin people simply make the right choices,"  she said.  </P> <P> Progress is monitored by weigh-ins and, at some camps, by periodic evaluations  of body fat. But the emphasis goes beyond the scale and calipers, say  directors. Campers also learn how to develop good nutritional and exercise  habits and how to make the mental switch from fat to thin.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Boosting Self-Image  </P> <P> To accomplish that, most camps have therapists or counselors to initiate  discussions. Campers are encouraged to talk to each other about eating habits  and how being overweight affects them. "We try to boost self-image," Kempton  said. "It's tied in with the ability to feel in control."  </P> <P> Group dynamics help bring the programs together, say proponents, who maintain  kids feel less embarrassed about their weight problems when surrounded by  others in the same boat.  </P> <P> "Kids compare weight loss," explained Kevin Sands of Encino, a 16-year-old  veteran camper. "Or they challenge each other to see who can lose the most."  Said another camp veteran: "I liked the fact that everyone was alike --  everyone had weight to lose."  </P> <P> However, the buddy system isn't foolproof. "Some of the thinner girls would  tease the fatter girls," recalled one former camper. "They would talk behind  girls' backs, saying things like, 'Isn't she big?' "  </P> <P> THE FOLLOW-UP  </P> <P> Losing weight at a summer camp is just the beginning; keeping it off at home is  the real challenge. So once camp ends, follow-up begins.  </P> <P> "We send them home with diets and menus," Friedman said. Other programs send  monthly newsletters or telephone graduates at regular intervals for progress  reports.  </P> <P> Those who attend Camp La Jolla take home an exercise video and an invitation to  call toll-free for advice or a pep talk. Campers at Camp Murrieta and Camp Del  Mar are grouped according to hometowns, said Kempton, and once home are  encouraged to form support groups.  </P> <P> Weight Watcher camps offer free eight-week memberships to campers, allowing  them to attend meetings in their communities, Sparber said.  </P> <P> Also considered crucial to long-term success is parent involvement. Camp La  Jolla invites parents to a weekend, free of charge, said executive director  Nancy Lenhart. Other camps provide parents with instructional materials or  tours.  </P> <P> THE RESULTS  </P> <P> In a follow-up survey, Camp Camelot found that 75% of graduates who answered a  progress report had maintained their weight loss a year later. The figure for  the same period was 82% among La Jolla graduates. Yet even camp directors  acknowledge the built-in biases of such surveys, noting that those who regain  weight aren't likely to respond.  </P> <P> Some weight-control experts believe such success rates are much lower but don't  have the scientific data to prove it. Studies are almost nonexistent with one  exception -- a report on 18 boys who attended a weight-loss camp in 1981,  published two years later in the International Journal of Obesity. In a  seven-week period the boys lost an average of 29 pounds, reported Judith Stern,  a UC Davis professor of nutrition. Average body fat decreased from 39% to 27.5%  -- noteworthy but still higher than ideal for them, she said. "What was  remarkable was the loss of fat, not muscle," she added. "And the boys felt good  about themselves. They viewed themselves (at the end) as normal weight. That's  unusual (for formerly fat people)."  </P> <P> FINDING THE RIGHT CAMP  </P> <P> To maximize the experience, experts suggest the following:  </P> <P>  -- Be wary of camps that promise too much too fast. Exactly how quickly  adolescents and preteens should lose weight is a matter of debate. While some  promise campers will shed three to five pounds a week, some obesity experts say  that's too much.  </P> <P>  -- Be sure the child is motivated. "When parents push weight loss too much,  the child resists," noted Dr. Barbara Ferguson, a child psychiatrist who  directs the Child Study Center at St. John's Hospital and Health Center in  Santa Monica.  </P> <P>  -- Obtain a thorough physical examination beforehand. Most camps require one  before enrolling, but an examination might also turn up depression or other  conditions contributing to a weight problem, said Dr. Adel Eldahmy, a Long  Beach psychiatrist who specializes in treating eating disorders.  </P> <P>  -- If a weight-loss camp is not nearby or not financially feasible, consider a  traditional camp and alert the staff to your child's need to lose weight, said  Albert Marston, a USC professor of psychology and weight control expert.  </P> <P>  -- Ask about the expertise of the staff. Most weight loss camps in Southern  California are accredited by the American Camping Assn., but there are no  special requirements for weight loss camps, said Shirley Walch, executive  director of the association's Southern California chapter. Parents should  inquire about the staff's expertise and training in weight control.  </P> <P>  -- Request documented weight-loss results, or ask about average weight loss.  Talk to parents who have sent their children to the camp.  </P> <P>  -- Don't skimp. A two-week session is probably not enough to instill habit  changes, said Dr. Morton H. Maxwell, a UCLA clinical professor of medicine and  director of its Risk Factor Obesity Program. A four-week session is better but  eight weeks is ideal, he said, noting it takes months to change eating habits.  </P> <P>  For a directory of camps in Southern California and Hawaii, call the American  Camping Assn., (213) 985-5781.  </P> <P> </P></p>

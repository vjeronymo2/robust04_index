			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices continue to give ground BID speculation provided the few firm features yesterday in a UK stock market where caution on the near-term outlook still prevailed. The latest of the expected flow of rights issues - a call for Pounds 428m from Commercial Union and a very small fund-raising from Stonehill - were taken comfortably but the conglomerates sector was on alert for a convertible issue this morning. Investors now face a heavy run of trading statements from the leading names of British industry, beginning today with British Petroleum, BT and BOC Group. Equities opened lower but rallied well until one UK house began to sell the March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index which quickly collapsed to a discount against the underlying stock market. Share prices quickly followed suit as the securities house unloaded blue chip stocks. The pace was set by a sharp fall in Reuters in London after the shares had been hit hard on Wall Street overnight. At worst, the Footsie was more than 21 points off with London looking nervous as New York opened lower. But the initial fall on the Dow Industrial Average was trimmed to 2.97 in UK hours, and late weakness in sterling was again interpreted as good for Britain's export stocks while not inhibiting chances of a base rate cut in the Budget in March. The FT-SE 100 closed at 2,816.4, a net 14.9 down, with the 2,800 mark still unchallenged, at least for the time being. Profit-taking spread across the range of the stock market and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index weakened 17.9 to 3,001.9. Seaq volume slipped to 616.1m shares from the 694.8m recorded in the previous session; Tuesday's retail business was worth Pounds 1.58bn, in the higher range of recent daily averages. The renewed weakness in the pound is working to the benefit of share prices in London, according to Mr Marcus Grubb at Salomon Brothers. He also believes that the Bundesbank will ease policy in the face of a slowing economy in Germany. The setback in sterling which followed the currency's exit from the ERM network provided a mirror image of the rise in the UK stock market between September and December last year. The mood in equities appeared less negative yesterday than on Tuesday, and the overall picture was more irregular than the fall in the Footsie might suggest. Oil shares, which have been very firm for some days, encountered cautious profit-taking as the sector braced itself for trading figures today from BP. Food retailers, casualties in the recent selling bout, found buyers. Bank stocks were firmer but the impetus here came from speculative activity rather than from views on the trading experiences likely to be revealed very shortly by the big UK houses. Suggestions of bid moves against some of the weaker names in the financial sector have been heard before and traders saw no new factors this time. The relatively favourable reception for the rights issue from Commercial Union still left share prices vulnerable to further fund-raising moves. Some analysts, however, believe that, at present interest rate levels, corporate finance directors may be looking at the bond and convertible bond markets rather than at equities as venues for fund-raising.</p>

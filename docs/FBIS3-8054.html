Slota, Slovaks Must Struggle To Ensure That `No Minority  Hinders the State-Forming Nation'"]    [Text] Bratislava--According to Slovak National Party  [SNS] Chairman Jan Slota, it would be best for Slovakia if early  parliamentary elections were held in June.    He also said that the "Bolsheviks" from the Party of the  Democratic Left [SDL] are trying to push back the date of the  elections as far as possible so that "they can reveal how they  will come again in the role of apostles and redeem this  country." He commented that "they redeemed it like this once  before, in 1948, and now they are preparing to do so again." J.  Slota is of the opinion that the communists and Bolsheviks, as  he calls the SDL members, are responsible for Slovakia's current  economic situation. The SNS chairman unreservedly supports the  drive for a petition and holding a referendum on all three  questions.    The SNS does not see priority in its activity being given to  the economic sphere because its aims are national ones. J.  Slota emphasized that there is also a social subtext in this  "national" aspect, and he added that "we Slovaks must struggle  to ensure that we all get on well and that this state-forming  nation is not endangered by any minority." The SNS would like  the state's defense to be oriented toward maintaining its  territorial integrity and the inviolability of its borders. The  SNS is in favor of the Slovak Army achieving combat readiness  "so that we can be sure that we have something to defend  ourselves with," he said. Another SNS priority is culture.  "Here we would like to take a look at the funds given to the  Hungarian press and culture, while, at the same time, our  Slovaks in South Slovakia are disregarded," said Slota.  According to him, the Hungarian minority in the Slovak Republic  has above-average rights. He said that they are constantly  bringing relations [between the communities] to a head. He  pointed out that "the Hungarians and the smallest ethnic  minority (the Jews) have a strong lobby here and that they are  against Slovakia. Perhaps, they have different aims for  Slovakia, aims at variance with those of the SNS," he added.    Jan Slota would not refuse the post of defense minister if  it  were offered to him. However, he does not want this fact to be  associated with his attacks on Defense Minister Andrejcak. He  added that Andrejcak is only supported in his post by the former  political instructors and members of the Communist Party of  Slovakia Central Committee and Communist Party of Czechoslovakia  Central Committee whom he has left in the Army.</p>

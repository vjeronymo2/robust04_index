			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Kohl issues plea to UK and Spain over EU enlargement Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany issued an extraordinary personal appeal to Britain and Spain yesterday to drop their objections to the compromise for enlargement of the European Union. He pinned the blame for the failure of the latest round of negotiations firmly on those two countries, and said if no agreement was reached by next week, it would be impossible to admit Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden by January 1 1995. 'Given the overriding political importance of this enlargement for Europe, it is completely impossible both for the (German) government, and for me in particular, to understand how some member states have not yet endorsed the consensus,' he said in an official statement. Mr Kohl said a fishing rights package put on the table on Tuesday protected the interests of all member states of the community, in particular Spain, while taking into account the particular importance of the industry for the Norwegian population. As for the British objection to any change in the number of votes needed for a 'blocking minority' in the Council of Ministers, he said the Greek presidency had put forward 'a sensible proposal' building on suggestions made by Germany. The German concern is that if the whole package is not tied up by next week at the latest, there will not be enough time for the European parliament and all member states, as well as applicants, to approve it before the end of the year. Officials fear if that deadline is missed, the enlargement process could be delayed for months. The German government is particularly baffled by the British attitude over the voting question. In Strasbourg, the European Parliament warned the UK and Spain it would not support the EU's planned move from 12 to 16 members without a change in voting rights to reflect an expanded Europe. But while the Norwegian government appeared sanguine yesterday about prospects for a final resolution of its fishing rights conflict with Spain, Madrid said proposals it had been presented with in Brussels late on Tuesday were 'a joke'. Government officials in Madrid dug their heels in after Germany's public criticism. Responding to a charge by Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, that Spain 'has to move', they said it was up to Norway to move by making a more serious offer. London, though, was trying to ignore the German appeal. No 10 Downing Street said that Mr John Major, the prime minister, remained 'determined to protect our interests in an enlarged community'. Officials said the government was committed to retaining the existing 23-vote blocking minority.

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / International Company News: Klockner-Werke sales decline 5.1% KLOCKNER-WERKE, the German steel and machinery group, reported half-year group sales falling by 5.1 per cent to DM3.37bn (Dollars 2.03bn), down from DM3.56bn for the same period the previous years. Sales in its steel subsidiaries, Klockner Stahl and Klockner Edelstahl, fell by 12.3 per cent to DM1.08bn for the six months to March 31. The company, which recently gained approval from creditors to write off DM1.4bn of its DM2.7bn net debt, refused to comment on its operational losses. In the steel divisions, analysts estimate losses at more than DM200m. Group sales in Germany fell by 9.7 per cent while sales abroad went down by a modest 0.2 per cent. However, in the machinery divisions sales for the six months rose by nearly 2 per cent to DM1.035bn. Sales in its synthetic material division fell by 3.9 per cent to DM1.261m. The two divisions each account for a third of total turnover. Industrial orders for its steel divisions fell by 15.7 per cent to DM1.511bn and by 6.8 per cent in its synthetic materials to DM1.257bn. The sharpest fall was recorded in its machinery branch where orders dropped by more than a third to DM827m. Under the debt rescheduling procedure, a legal step short of bankruptcy proceedings, the company has pledged to pay a third of distributable profits over the next eight years to creditors writing-off up to 60 per cent of their loans.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (9): The high priest of Moggonomics PICNICS ON VESUVIUS by William Rees-Mogg Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, Pounds 17.50, 396 pages IT IS TRUE, Lord Rees-Mogg agrees, that he actually read the Financial Times every day over breakfast at Oxford, a fact which when publicised in Isis brought the young fogey the reward of a job on the pink paper (he rose to be chief leader writer in the late 1950s). There is a glimpse here of a long-lost world: students today surely do not even eat breakfast, let alone read the FT. The quality of the young FT set at the time, he muses, was so high, including as it did the likes of Jock Bruce-Gardyne, Shirley Williams and Sam Brittan, that 'we were able to take Nigel Lawson in our stride, which is more than any Cabinet was able to do'. Now he is an old fogey, contributing entertaining, opinionated, occasionally profound weekly columns to The Independent. He has also formed a curious partnership with an American called James Dale Davidson; together this odd couple has published two lurid and lucrative non-fiction financial spinechillers, Blood in the Streets and The Great Reckoning. This collection of articles from The Independent is mostly quite different in character, but even here Rees-Mogg clearly enjoys the occasional role of prophet of doom - hence, presumably, the title. Although once right at the heart of the British Establishment as editor of The Times, and still retaining a foothold among the great and the good, as chairman of the Broadcasting Standards Council, William Rees-Mogg has always indulged in the eccentricities allowed to the upper classes. He pleaded for the return to the gold standard in the 1970s when conventional wisdom was still Keynesian; he is Roman Catholic rather than Anglican. He is both snobbish, for example describing the despised 1960s as 'a decade in which society took its values from photographers and hairdressers', and occasionally vulgar as in his books on what is described coarsely as 'megapolitics'. He writes in what he claims to be 'a subdued copy of an 18th century style' which is probably one of his rather rare little jokes. The only other discernable one is his regret at never having met Ms Pamella Bordes 'which perhaps makes me a unique figure among those who have edited London journals in the past twenty years'. In fact his style is commendably modern and direct, well-suited to the discipline of 1,000-word chunks of which the book is largely composed, interspersed with a few rather longer and newely-written introductions to the various sections. He is also ready to pepper the texts with personal or family details, which is a slightly risky approach. We do not really want to know that there are 250 Moggs in the US, and that one branch of the family adopted the spelling Mugge; but on the other hand there is the diverting story of ghostly Dorothy Mogg who for years after her death in the 18th century prowled the bedroom of a house in Wincanton until she was exorcised. The first piece in The Independent which really pleased him, he says, was a late 1986 attack on Somerset County Cricket Club for the ejection of Botham, Richards and Garner. He had felt about the Somerset side of the early 1980s 'rather as Carlyle felt about Frederick the Great' (and he is not talking about Trueman, we suppose). The curse of Mogg was duly pronounced and by 1992 Somerset were bottom of the county table, and worse than that, 'were a side of no consequence'. The demands of a weekly deadline are considerable and some of the topical articles can date very quickly. A November 1991 column on the just-deceased Robert Maxwell does not look particularly well-judged today, and it is perhaps brave of Rees-Mogg to include it here. 'I shall remember him with affection,' he wrote at the time. He updates this now with the remark that 'now I know that when I drank his champagne it may have been fraudulently paid for'. What are we to make of Moggonomics? The self-confessed 'loose Keynesian' from the FT think tank of the 1950s was converted to monetarism by Peter Jay in his days as economic editor of The Times. Rees-Mogg additionally encouraged Tim Congdon, who also converted to monetarism in The Times in the 1970s. Temperamentally, though, he claims to be a currency fixer rather than a floater, a trait reflected in his hankering for a return to gold as hyperinflation loomed in the 1970s. Nevertheless he firmly came out a year ago against Britain's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism, and correctly predicted a crisis some time in 1992 in which Britain might have to abandon the attempt to maintain a fixed exchange rate. Latterly he has moved towards fringe economic doctrines such as the rather dubious cyclical approach of Juglar and Kondratieff, but who is to say he is wrong? There is much of interest here, although these are bite-sized rather than plate-filling portions, and you might find some volcanic ash in your sandwiches.</p>

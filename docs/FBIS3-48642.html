The pair, who  appear to be North Koreans in their 20s, have been hospitalized.  If they regain consciousness, they will be given the option of  returning to North Korea or remaining free in the South. The  1-ton ship, 1.5-meters long and 3.5-meters wide, seems to be  from Yuk-to Island and was towed to Paengnyong-do, the spokesman  said.</p>

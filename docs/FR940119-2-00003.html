			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Comments Received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received comments from two respondents, Ceramica Regiomontana and Ceramica Santa Julia.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 1: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As in past reviews, Ceramica Regiomontana contends that the Department does not have the legal authority to impose countervailing duties on ceramic tile from Mexico and must revoke the countervailing duty order. Effective April 23, 1985, the date of the ``Understanding Between the United States and Mexico Regarding Subsidies and Countervailing Duties'' (the Understanding), Mexico became a ``country under the Agreement''. Therefore, Ceramica Regiomontana argues that 19 U.S.C. 1671 requires an affirmative injury determination as a prerequisite to the imposition of countervailing duties on any Mexican merchandise imported on or after April 23, 1985, regardless of whether the countervailing duty order was published before or after the date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ceramica Regiomontana further contends that the Department's failure to revoke this order is inconsistent with past practice. In two previous countervailing duty administrative reviews, Certain Fasteners from India; Final Results of Administrative Review and Partial Revocation of Countervailing Duty Order (47 FR 44129; October 6, 1982) and Carbon Steel Wire Rod from Trinidad and Tobago; Preliminary Results of Changed Circumstances Administrative Review and Tentative Determination to Revoke Countervailing Duty Order (50 FR 19561; May 9, 1985), where an outstanding countervailing duty order was issued pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 19 U.S.C. 1303(a) without benefit of an ITC injury determination, the Department determined that it did not have the authority to impose countervailing duties when events subsequent to the issuance of the order required an affirmative ITC injury determination prior to imposition of countervailing duties. Since the ITC has indicated that it does not have the legal authority to conduct an injury investigation concerning merchandise already subject to a countervailing duty order, the Department has in the past concluded that it could not impose countervailing duties and revoked, or preliminarily determined to revoke, the order effective the date the affirmative injury determination became a requirement. Therefore, the Department should revoke the countervailing duty order on ceramic tile and refund all deposits of estimated countervailing duties by Ceramica Regiomontana during the 1991 review period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We fully addressed this issue in a previous administrative review of this countervailing duty order. See Ceramic Tile from Mexico; Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review (55 FR 50744; December 10, 1990). The U.S. Court of International Trade and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) have sustained the Department's legal position that Mexican imports subject to an outstanding countervailing duty order already in effect when Mexico entered into the Understanding are not entitled to an injury test pursuant to section 701 of the Tariff Act and paragraph 5 of the Understanding ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cementos Anahuac del Golfo, S.A. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 879 F.2d 847 (Fed. Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 110 S. CT. 1318 (1989)). The countervailing duty order on ceramic tile from Mexico was published prior to Mexico's entering into the Understanding, therefore, imports of ceramic tile are not entitled to an injury test pursuant to section 701 of the Tariff Act. Ceramica Regiomontana has provided neither new evidence nor new arguments on this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 2: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As in the last administrative review of ceramic tile, Ceramica Regiomontana contests the Department's determination that BANCOMEXT and FOMEX loans taken out by the company were countervailable. The respondent contends that the use of a commercial rate as a benchmark in the Department's calculation is inconsistent with Item (k) of the Illustrative List of Export Subsidies annexed to the Agreement on Interpretation and Application of Articles VI, XVI, and XXIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Item (k) of the Illustrative List defines an export subsidy as the granting of export credits by governments at interest rates below the cost of funds to the government. BANCOMEXT and FOMEX financing meets the cost to government standard and therefore do not provide countervailable subsidies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

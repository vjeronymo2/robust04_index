			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Our country is keeping two batallions of  paracommandos standing by for a possible evacuation of our  fellow countrymen in Rwanda in Africa. The BELGA news agency  learned this from government circles. Some 800 paracommandos  were put on standby as early as yesterday evening. They are  standing by to evacuate the 1,500 Belgians in Rwanda and if  necessary, also other foreigners, should the Belgian Government  so decide. The Cabinet reconvenes at 1500 hours [1400 GMT] to  discuss the situation in Rwanda. It will decide whether an  evacuation will be launched.    At the military airport of Melsbroek, security has been put  on standby. However, the men have received the direct command  to say nothing.    France, too, is said to be considering deploying its troops  in the central African republic for a possible evacuation of its  fellow countrymen, but for the time being, no decision has been  made. There are some 600 French in Rwanda, most of them living  in Kigali. [passage omitted]</p>

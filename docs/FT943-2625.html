			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / A song for yobs and nobs: Peter Aspden on why 'Land of Hope and Glory' makes him uneasy Listening to 'Land of Hope and Glory' always makes me fidget in my seat, not least because of the withering looks all around me which suggest I should be standing. It is not a sign of disrespect, more a sense of unease over the sentiments being unleashed, and their appropriateness to the occasion. The two versions I heard recently, both celebrating very diverse aspects of nationhood, were rousing testaments to the real joy many people experience singing this powerful anthem; but I could not help wondering if the two groups were actually divided by a common call to exaltation. The first was at Wembley Stadium last week where, as has been the practice for a few years now, Elgar's march was blasted out by the orchestra as the two teams came on to the pitch. The unashamed point of the exercise is to provoke the crowd into vociferous vocal support for the home team, to intimidate the opposition, to swell the roar of those three lions on the shirts of what sometimes look like some very young, skinny lads. Nothing wrong here at all; sport is regarded as a legitimate and secure arena for such feelings. It thrives on adrenalin, theatricality and violence of passion. And last week's opponents, the United States, after their improbably prosperous summer, are not unfamiliar with intensity of feeling and big-crowd psychology. The reservations surface a few moments later, when, as always happens, the opposition's national anthem is played. Not that anyone can hear it very clearly; for the crowd, now surging into a higher plane of fervour, drowns it out, by boos, whistles, curses and simple abuse. It is an ugly, witless display, embarrassing to share (one can never wholly detach oneself from a crowd) and ineluctably staining any dignity which the preceding minutes had acquired. It was with some trepidation, then, that I watched the climax of the Last Night of the Proms a few days later. Not only another 'Land of Hope and Glory', but a 'Rule Britannia' and 'Jerusalem' to follow: a triple shot of patriotic lust just in case we missed the point. It made me feel uncomfortable, I admit, but maybe Wembley had unduly poisoned my judgment. In fact, the Royal Albert Hall, awash with flags of many nations, seemed a genuinely joyful place to be. My anxieties were allayed completely when Bryn Terfel stepped up to lead 'Rule Britannia', bursting with Welsh pride (no need to do any swelling here) but tempering the proceedings with a tightly clutched rugby ball and flag sticking out of his back. Here was patriotism all right, but placed firmly in inverted commas, a bit of a laugh, perfectly pitched for an audience which above all was looking for a good time. Here, after all, is how the British should handle nationalism, with lashings of irony, glancing backwards but rooted firmly in our present less-than-auspicious circumstances. Tolerance, wit and self-effacement are not virtues to be under-estimated; this surely is the perfect way to celebrate them. And yet, I continue to feel uneasy. Is it not too complacent to distinguish so easily between the vulgar inanities of a yob culture and the cleverly modulated coolness of a nob culture? They are, it should be remembered, singing the same song. On a freezing mid-winter night some years ago, England entertained Cameroon for another friendly match. It was a few weeks into the Gulf War, and feelings, notwithstanding the bitter cold, were running higher than usual. As the Cameroon stars of the 1990 World Cup lined up, a clutch of Arsenal fans in front of me struck up a half-hearted chant which soon evaporated into the bleak night: 'Saddam is a yiddo, Saddam is a yiddo . . .' The perplexing irrelevance of the chant - one needs a crash course in North London demographics to understand it - is almost funny, were it not for the fact that this pithy slice of 'terrace humour' managed, with one bilious brushstroke, to offend at least three religions, two continents and a clutch of squirming liberal-pacifists who just wanted to enjoy the match. The British are fortunate enough not to be at war at present; but one ought to be more careful than ever with hope and glory. Neither one is in plentiful supply right now, and the crassness of the acts committed in their name belongs to all of us.</p>

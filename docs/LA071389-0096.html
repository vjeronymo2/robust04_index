			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT BLOCKS STATE-FUNDED ABORTION CURBS  </P> <P> A state Court of Appeal on Wednesday blocked new legislative restrictions on  state-funded abortions for low-income women, ordering such payments to continue  while it considers a constitutional challenge to the limitations.  </P> <P> The court also barred state authorities from sending notices of the impending  restrictions to recipients of Medi-Cal assistance, the program under which the  abortions are obtained. Those notices had been set to go out Friday.  </P> <P> The suit challenging the funding limitation marks the first test of abortion  rights in California since a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last week gave states  more leeway to restrict abortion.  </P> <P> In an order signed by Presiding Appellate Justice J. Anthony Kline, the panel  instructed officials to "continue to perform all ministerial duties" in  providing funds for abortions, pending a further ruling in a suit filed Tuesday  by civil rights and women's groups.  </P> <P> The panel gave attorneys for the state Department of Health Services and other  defendants until July 31 to file briefs responding to the rights groups'  challenge to abortion curbs. The funding limitation was included in the 1989-90  Budget Act signed last week by Gov. George Deukmejian.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Provisions  </P> <P> The restrictions permit state-funded abortions only when the mother's life is  in danger, a pregnancy has resulted from rape or incest, the unborn child is  severely deformed or an unmarried minor has notified a parent. The state courts  have struck down similar limitations for the last 11 years.  </P> <P> If implemented, the new restrictions would deny state funding for about 90% of  the 80,000 abortions that have been performed annually under the Medi-Cal  program.  </P> <P> The suit, filed by lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union and other  groups, claims the restrictions violate the right to privacy and other  provisions of the state Constitution.  </P> <P> While the federal high court's ruling last week did not change California law,  attorneys for state officials in the suit say they plan to cite the decision in  defending the Legislature's right to impose the funding restrictions.  </P> <P> The suit is expected to reach the state Supreme Court later this year. The  court ruled in 1981 that under the California Constitution, the state could not  deny funds for abortion while paying for childbirth services.  </P> <P> Since then, however, conservatives have replaced liberals as a majority on the  court, and anti-abortion leaders have expressed hope that the newly aligned  court may decide to reconsider the 1981 ruling.  </P></p>

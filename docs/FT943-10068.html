			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / SPD pledges to shift German taxation burden Germany's opposition Social Democrats will cut taxes for the low-paid but introduce a supplementary 10 per cent increase for higher income earners if they win the next election, Mr Oskar Lafontaine, the SPD's main economics spokesman, said yesterday. The federal elections are due to be held on October 16. In an interview with Bild am Sonntag, Mr Lafontaine said an SPD government would also raise energy taxes and abolish the 7.5 per cent solidarity surcharge on income tax, easing the burden for 80 per cent of taxpayers. This tax was imposed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democrats to help finance the cost of German unification. The SPD, which is trailing the CDU by eight percentage points in the opinion polls, is trying to attract the lower paid as well as environmentalists. But its decision to impose an extra tax burden on high income earners was criticised when the SPD unveiled part of its economic programme earlier this year. Mr Lafontaine said lower taxes would be financed in three ways. Married couples earning over DM120,000 (Pounds 49,600) a year, or DM60,000 for single people, would pay 'a supplementary charge of 10 per cent. . . which would produce about DM25bn'. This amount, he said, would finance the cost of abolishing the solidarity surcharge. Energy taxes for petrol, electricity and gas would be increased, but Mr Lafontaine did not say by how much. In addition, tax breaks for married couples would be reduced, raising an additional revenue of DM11bn.</p>

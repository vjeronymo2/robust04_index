			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: London Traders will be hoping that the gilts market can enjoy a respite this week after the battering it has taken since the start of the year. The benchmark 9 per cent 2008 issue has fallen by around nine points since January 1, while the yield has risen from 6.38 to 7.23 per cent. Many feel the falls in prices have ignored the promising economic outlook. 'Nothing has changed in the past few weeks to justify a change in the fundamental view of inflation in the UK,' say Mr Julian Wiseman and Mr David Mackie of J P Morgan. There are few economic statistics due this week which could change the mood of the UK market. The main event will be Wednesday's monthly monetary meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. After the poor reaction to last month's rate cut, the duo could be forgiven for being cautious about further cuts; on the other hand, the April tax increases have yet to hit consumers' pockets. Any decision to cut rates would not be acted upon immediately, giving the market plenty of scope for speculation, but it is hard to resist the conclusion that it will be the mood of international bond markets, and particularly US Treasuries, that will determine the short-term fate of gilts.</p>

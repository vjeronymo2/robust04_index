			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / International Company News: Banks warn of Ferruzzi rescue delay THE FIVE main creditor banks to Italy's troubled Ferruzzi group yesterday warned they would need at least 40 days to prepare a detailed examination of its accounts before progress could be made on a rescue plan. The report, on a leading Italian news agency, followed a meeting yesterday of Ferruzzi's five main creditor banks, led by Mediobanca. A Ferruzzi official declined to comment on the news. The report also said the creditor banks had decided not to appoint a new executive to run the group, as had been expected, but to alter the boards of directors of Ferruzzi's subsidiaries at their forthcoming general meetings. The suggestion that a rescue will take much longer than expected looks set to depress the value of Ferruzzi group shares, just as they rebounded in Milan yesterday as dealers reacted positively to a terse statement by a broader group of Ferruzzi's leading bankers on Wednesday night that they would stand by the company. The banks' declaration, which followed talks at the Bank of Italy, was enough to trigger a rise of almost 14 per cent in the share price of the Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company to L562.8 from L494.8. Shares in Montedison, the group's main industrial operation, also recovered by almost 14 per cent to close at L846. Dealers remain confused by plans for the company and by conflicting reports of the exposure of Ferfin's five main lenders. Shares in the banks had fallen sharply as brokers expected problems with their credits to affect earnings. Last week, Ferfin admitted it had been unable to meet some of its financial commitments since the end of last month. Wednesday night's statement confirmed the readiness of Ferruzzi's main bank creditors to support the group during its restructuring. In an indication that an outright dismemberment was not imminent, the statement said the objective was 'to safeguard the basic integrity of the strategic activities of Italy's second-biggest private sector group'. It did not indicate what were considered to be the strategic activities of the far-flung Ferruzzi empire, whose businesses include agro-industrial operations, energy, and cement and building materials, as well as financial services. The statement also boosted shares in the Fondiaria insurance operation, which this week announced plans for a rights issue underwritten by the five creditor banks. The deal for the company, controlled by Ferruzzi through a joint venture, is likely to spell the effective transfer of control of Fondiaria to the creditor banks.</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Treuhand in first five-year bond issues THE TREUHAND, Germany's agency responsible for the privatisation of the eastern economy, is to issue five-year bonds for the first time. The Treuhand has already been a regular borrower in the 10-year and commercial paper sectors. The five-year bonds will be deliverable into the Bobl contracts on medium-term German paper traded on both the DTB options and futures exchange and on London's Liffe. They may be used as collateral for Lombard borrowings, the Bundesbank said. Officials from Deutsche Bank yesterday described the issue as 'attractive,' and likely to interest foreign investors. The Treuhand declined to say how much it intended to raise through this issue. It said there would be several issues a year. Both revenue and expenditure fell short of their targets in 1992, according to the Treuhand annual report, issued earlier this month.</p>

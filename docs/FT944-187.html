			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading It was a poor day in the derivatives market with a lack of buying, combined with dull sentiment after an overnight retreat on Wall Street, yesterday's falls in European markets and weakness in UK gilts, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, signs that Wednesday's rally had run out of steam were seen at the outset as the March contract on the FT-SE 100 began an early slide. A greater number of independent traders was said to have returned to the market but with few willing buyers many were left twiddling their thumbs for most of the day. Sentiment was further dampened by a retreat in other European markets which followed disappointment with the German bund auction. In the afternoon, the setback in the UK gilts sector brought a further slide and the contract fell to its low of 3,075 around the time of the announcement of an increase in French base rates. March finished at 3,077, down 41 on its previous close but at a 12-point premium to the underlying cash market. Volume was 4,699 lots. It was an equally poor day in the traded options sector and turnover slipped to a mere 13,564 contracts of which 6,799 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and a paltry 244 in the Euro FT-SE option. Wellcome was the busiest stock option at 1,006 trades. J. Sainsbury and Glaxo were the other active stock options.</p>

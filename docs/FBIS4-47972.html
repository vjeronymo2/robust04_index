			<p>BFN     [Text] The Federal Government intervention in the acute  fuel shortage experienced all over the country in the last two  to three weeks and the NNPC [Nigerian National Petroleum  Corporation] response to the challenge has brought some measure  of relief to motorists living in Lagos metropolis.    Energy correspondent Antonia Amosu, who monitored the  situation in Lagos today, reports that fuel is now available at  virtually all filling stations. She, however, observes that in  spite of this, the long queues at filling stations have not yet  disappeared. The queues are only shorter. Deliveries of petrol  to filling stations are proceeding uninterrupted. The traffic  in Lagos is a confirmation of the improved petrol situation as  the usual congestion is back and commuting from one end to  another is taking longer hours compared to last week when the  roads were free.    Petroleum and Mineral Resources Minister Chief Don Etiebet  was taken up by journalists on the issue of petroleum smuggling  after inaugurating a five-member administering committee of the  Petroleum Technology Development Fund today:    [Begin Etiebet recording] [Words indistinct] and it has  become, I must tell you, an occupation in the country. It has  come an industry, institutionalized. So, it is going to take  some time to disappear; and they are always looking to see  whether you are relentless enough. We should continue with the  fight. So, today they will stop and tomorrow they will start  again. But I want to assure you, and members of the public,  that government is going to be absolutely relentless in pursuing  this course. [end recording]</p>

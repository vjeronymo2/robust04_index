			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Kantor puts on the kid gloves to appease US industrial lobby - Textiles WHILE sectors like pharmaceuticals, steel and spirits were raised specifically in the Quad report to G7 leaders, textiles concessions were handled with kid gloves by Mr Mickey Kantor - in deference to powerful industrial lobbying in the US. The word 'textiles' does not appear in the text of the report. It simply refers to sectors in which tariffs are higher than 15 per cent, and says 'we will negotiate the maximum achievable package of tariff reductions, recognising the objective of reaching 50 per cent reductions' - as long as other countries 'provide effective market access through tariff reductions and appropriate non-tariff disciplines'. Behind the coded language this is a clear signal to developing countries - in particular China and Taiwan which at present fall outside Gatt disciplines - that a deal on textiles will only be delivered finally when multilateral negotiations in Geneva during autumn coax market opening gestures from them. Lobbyists for the US textile industry have clung increasingly firmly to their tariff protection as they have begun to come to terms with planned reform of the Multifibre Arrangement, under which quotas will be phased out over a 10-year period. In a letter to Senator Ernest Hollings, the leading protector of textile interests, Mr Kantor promised not to negotiate a deal that failed to provide US access to developing country markets for fibres, textiles and apparel. 'We understand the importance of insisting that those who benefit from the phase-out of the Multifibre Arrangement must also be willing to open their domestic markets,' he said. Thus the US was constrained in making detailed textiles concessions in the Tokyo talks (and so, incidentally was unable to press hard for gains the US electronics industrywanted). In electronics, the negotiators agreed only tariff cuts of at least a third and possibly a half. Mr Michael Maibach, government affairs director for Intel, the computer company, said he was 'disappointed' but not ready to abandon the zero-zero tariff concept. He was heartened by the possibility of tariff elimination for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, which the EC industry does not oppose.</p>

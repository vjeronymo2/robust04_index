			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Shapovalov: "Reading Between the </F> Lines. Postscript to V. Chernomyrdin's Visit"]    [Text] There is an extremely fine line between politics  and economics because the former, as is known, follows from the  latter. It is not enough to assess the visit solely on the  meetings with B. Clinton and other leading figures. We must  also take account of the meetings at which at first sight  inconspicuous yet essentially very important work was done, as  evidenced by the avidity with which the interlocutors hung on  every word spoken by the guest from Moscow. To this should also  be added the contribution made by the six leading Russian  Federation ministers who came to Washington to participate in  the third session of the Russian-U.S. Intergovernmental  Commission on Economic and Technological Cooperation (this gave  observers cause to joke that an away session of the Russian  Government was being held in America).    The Americans seemed to be most interested in one thing:  What was happening in Russia at this moment, and whether the  guests would be so bold as to speak again about the allocation  of aid, on which the limit, even the verbal limit -- this was  not concealed in Washington -- has already been reached.  Instead, advice was offered about "living according to our  means" and about cooperation in the spheres of space  exploration, nuclear power, and environmental protection.    Portraying the present situation in Russia, Viktor  Chernomyrdin strengthened the Americans' faith in the reforms  being implemented in our country. At the same time he made it  clear (unobtrusively) that the results might have been still  more tangible but for "Cold War relics" -- restrictions of  various kinds. Thus, the development of bilateral trade  relations is being held up not so much by the uncompetitiveness  of many Russian commodities as by obstacles in the United States  in the way of high-tech products coming from Russia. The cause  of this -- tough antidumping legislation -- was not only named.  V. Chernomyrdin called for the repeal of the notorious  Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Bill and also for the U.S.  Administration to recognize Russia's status as a country with a  transitional market economy.    At the same time he stated this not just at the highest  level. The premier ventured to do something that no Soviet or  Russian leading figure has done before: to have a meeting with  the leadership of the National Conference on Soviet Jewry -- the  very body on whose initiative the Jackson-Vanik Amendment was,  in fact, approved. The unusual approach was repaid with  interest. The representatives of the "influential Zionist  lobby" in the United States (this was what they were called  under the totalitarian regime) listened to the premier with  interest and promised assistance but, at the same time, did not  conceal their concern about the growth of crime and acts of  anti-Semitism in Russia. Chernomyrdin in turn promised effective  government assistance in settling problems, while emphasizing,  however, that political stabilization is inconceivable without  economic stabilization, particularly the repeal of the  Jackson-Vanik Amendment.    It would evidently be naive to think that the various kinds  of unevenness in Russian-U.S. relations will be eliminated at  once. A number of congressmen, for example, dislike the fact  that almost 20 documents on bilateral cooperation signed in the  United States include an agreement to include Russia in the  international program to build the Alpha space station: They  say that this will entail U.S. expenditure.</p>

TRT correspondent  Yasar Kefeli reports from Brussels:    [Begin recording] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, who arrived  in Brussels today to attend the NATO summit, received the  representatives of the Turkish community in Belgium and listened  to their problems. Ciller stated that the Turkish state wants  to help Turkish citizens abroad in a way that will keep them  from forgetting their origins. Pointing out that some of the  just causes of Turks living in Belgium can be addressed  immediately, Ciller said: Some of the incidents that occurred  in this country particularly have saddened and deeply hurt you  all. The whole world should condemn the recent PKK actions.  These incidents have caused concern among our citizens here.  We will have the opportunity to raise this matter again with  the relevant authorities and on the necessary platforms.    Conveying their problems to Ciller, representatives of the  Turkish community in Belgium remarked in turn that the local  media and political circles leveled unjust accusations against  the Turkish community with regard to the incidents triggered by  the PKK in Brussels. The representatives asked the prime  minister to send a Turkish parliamentary delegation to Brussels  to investigate and clarify the matter. [passage omitted] [end  recording]</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: BSI climbs slightly to SFr58m over year BANCA della Swizzera Italiana (BSI), Switzerland's sixth largest commercial bank, has reported net income of SFr58m (Dollars 41m) in 1991, up slightly from the SFr57.7m earned in the previous year. Gross profit at the bank, in which Swiss Bank Corporation has a controlling interest, was SFr150m, down 5 per cent. However, the previous year's figure included SFr50m in extraordinary gains on the sale of participations in banks in Monaco and Luxembourg. Depreciation and provisions were SFr92m, down from SFr100.6m in 1990. The bank said the satisfactory operating results were attributable to a better interest margin and higher income from commissions, foreign exchange transactions and securities. Net of interest and brokerage paid, total income was SFr433m, 13 per cent above the level of the previous year, excluding the extraordinary gains. At December 31 1991, total assets were SFr9.9bn, up 8 per cent from a year earlier. Loans grew 4 per cent to SFr5.8bn and deposits were up 8 per cent to SFr6.4bn. Disclosed shareholders' equity, after the proposed unchanged 16 per cent dividend and allocations to reserves, would be SFr762m.</p>

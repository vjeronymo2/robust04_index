			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / A cheerful Armenian tries to survive in a hostile sea: John Lloyd reports on the threats of violence being faced by a dwindling minority in Baku RAIR is not his real name, and he will not allow himself to be photographed. No surprise: he is one of the tiny number of Armenians still living in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku. He is not leaving, and he is prepared to talk on condition of anonymity, but he does not want to take too many chances. Rair lived through the anti-Armenian pogroms in Baku 15 months ago: he must now live, under his own Armenian name, under the shadow of the atrocities at Khodjaly, in Nagorno-Karabakh, where an unknown number of Azeris were massacred by Armenian guerrillas. A craftsman in a military plant repairing trucks in the suburbs of Baku, he is a cheerful man in his 40s. But the account of his life shows what accommodations he must make to remain relatively secure in a hostile sea - chief among these being an acceptance, in public at least and perhaps privately too, of the Azerbaijani version of current events. 'I haven't suffered any trouble after Khodjaly. No-one said anything to me. But I'm a bit more fearful.' He pauses, then adds: 'Anyway, that's all wrong, what the Russian and western press writes. There were thousands killed there, massacred by these people (the Armenians). My son's friends told him about it.' His son works for the Azerbaijani OMON, the special militia used for riot control and paramilitary tasks - some of whom are now deployed on the borders of Nagorno-Karabakh. 'He's an Azerbaijani now,' says Rair. Clearly, his son's profession - which he mentions several times - serves as a shield. He knows of only a few Armenian families left in the city, most of those, he thinks, of mixed Azerbaijani-Armenian marriages (his own wife is Russian). 'I've been here 14 years, and we Armenians were hundreds of thousands in the city. Now they've left: my brother left two years ago, I have another son in Armenia. But I tell you, if things were peaceful here, all of them would be back in a flash.' In his own plant, with some 500 workmen, the Armenians had made up 60-70 per cent of the workforce. Colonel Ernest Altman (who is Jewish), the director of the plant, says that 'all left in the last three years. Now there is a terrible problem to replace them because they made up such a large proportion of skilled labour and professional people.' Asked about earlier Azerbaijani outrages, when mobs attacked and killed many Armenian residents in Baku, and before that in Sumgait, Rair takes the standard Azerbaijani line. 'It was all exaggerated. In Sumgait, for example, a lot of the fighting was between the Armenians themselves. Yes, the Armenians did it themselves, much of it anyway. The press don't write about that.' His constant references to the deficiencies of the western press echo a standard, and aggressively repeated, complaint which Azerbaijanis direct at western journalists. Few can have read a word of western coverage: it is more a reflection of an assumption of pro-Armenian (Christian) bias, which is endlessly repeated. 'Still, I'm sorry that (former President Ayaz) Mutalibov is gone. He was a good man (a common opinion in Azerbaijan). Now, I fear the new people in power, I don't know what they will do. I've been here a long time, and I think I will end here. But not soon, I hope.'</p>

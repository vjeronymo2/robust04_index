In a statement to AL-HAYAH Durdah saluted "the Egyptian  brothers for their awareness of the conspiracy." He pointed out  that the economic effects of the Lockerbie crisis has paralyzed  Libya's ability to meet spending requirements in all spheres,  especially with regard to new development projects and securing  foreign currency to finance imports.    He pointed out that exporting states are setting the  condition that Libya pay the financial credits for imports in  full. He said that even the budgets of the biggest and richest  states cannot do that.    On Libya's cooperation with Egypt and Tunis, he said that  "European states took accounts of their interests when they  adopted the resolutions against Libya. But some Arab brothers  -- either because they did not directly read the text of the  Security Council resolution or because of the influence of  Western media services -- did not understand the resolution the  way the Western states concerned with the crisis did." He  declined to name these states.    On the reduction in the volume of Egyptian-Libyan trade  after  Mansur al-Kikhya's disappearance, he said: "There is no link  between trade and al-Kikhya's disappearance. Libya has lost  billions of dollars as a result of the freezing of its assets  abroad. And Libya has taken a number of measures" -- he  declined to reveal them -- "to secure the largest amount  possible of these investments, especially liquid investment or  those that are easy to liquefy."    On the measures Libya is going to take to reduce workers,  Durdah said: "Necessity knows no laws." Libya is preparing  steps in this connection, but it will not touch Egyptian and  Tunisian workers in particular.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / School tours operation emerges in new guise ADVENTURE Travel Inter-national, the school tours operator that ceased trading just before Easter, has emerged in a new guise, employing the same staff. School Life, the new concern, is approaching schools that had booked holidays with ATI, offering to provide the same or similar trips. School Life says the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) and ATI's administrative receivers have approved its approach to schools. Both parties deny the claim. ATI, based in Shipley, West Yorkshire, is one of several school operators that have collapsed since February. Its failure and that of Sun Living, a competitor in Lancing, East Sussex, have created a financial crisis for Abta, which faces a Pounds 3.5m bill to bail out the two companies' customers. Ms Celia Ryan, School Life's coach sales co-ordinator, was fielding inquiries yesterday on the Leicester number that schools were told to contact. She said: 'We have Abta's approval and the liquidator's approval to take over all the bookings and the business of ATI.' One of ATI's receivers, Mr Alan Marlor, of accountants Ernst &amp; Young, said yesterday: 'That is wrong.' On the contrary, he said, the receivers had sold the business to Cambridge-based David Winter Travel, an Abta member trading as School Tours. It will pay the receivers a fee for each holiday re-booked. Mr David Hurst, Abta's head of public affairs, said: 'We can say absolutely categorically that School Life is not a member of Abta. We have not heard of this company. We have not given it permission to take over any business.' A letter received by one school in Kent says School Life is 'backed by' Midland Fox, the Leicester-based bus and coach operator. Mr David Martin, Midland Fox's managing director, described School Life as a trading division of his company. Mr Marlor said Midland Fox had made an offer for ATI's business, which had been rejected as unacceptable. At School Life, Ms Ryan said: 'We have retained the (ATI) staff because of their experience in putting together tours.' Asked if that included Mr Nigel Parker and Mr David Constance - ATI's founders, who sold the company in January but remained as consultants - she said: 'They're both involved at the moment, at least until everything is sorted out.' Package holidays booked through Midland Fox are covered by the Bus and Coach Council's bond scheme, which Abta recognises but for which it takes no responsibility. One school approached by School Life was Sowerby Bridge High School in Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire. Mr Russell Lawrance, a teacher who helped organise a trip due in July, said a message from Ms Suzanne Baxter of School Life was waiting when he returned from Easter holidays on April 8. Ms Baxter was formerly customer services manager at ATI. Ms Baxter offered to rearrange the Sowerby Bridge school's trip to France to a Spanish destination, Mr Lawrance said. After checking with Abta, Mr Lawrance decided not to do so. He will apply to Abta for a refund of the Pounds 4,200 deposit lodged with ATI. At St Simon Stock school in Maidstone, Kent, the approach came from Mr Andy Ellson, School Life's festivals manager. He was owner and managing director of Tourland, which arranged coach transport for ATI holidays. In an undated letter, which Mr Paul Murphy, a teacher, received on Monday, Mr Ellson offered 'a guaranteed tour as originally arranged by me on behalf of ATI at the same price and same location with my new organisation, School Life.' The School Life brochure counsels schools to apply directly to Abta for refunds. ATI, an Abta member, blamed its collapse on the organisation's delay in sending it money due to Sun Living customers who had rebooked with ATI. Mr John Dunscombe, Abta's president, indicated last week that it would scrutinise carefully any application for refunds received from non-members. Mr Murphy said his school would not take up School Life's offer but, like Sowerby Bridge, would apply to Abta for a refund. Rank Organisation, the leisure group that owns New World Travel, a school holidays operator, has acquired the summer booking files of Adventure Express from its receivers. Adventure Express, based in Chesham, Buckinghamshire, ceased trading on March 28, the same day as ATI, but is not related to it. Letters, Page 15</p>

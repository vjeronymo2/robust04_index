			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A HABITAT HAVEN;  </P> <P> UPPER NEWPORT BAY JOINS STATE PROGRAM THAT WILL RAISE PROTECTION MONEY  </P> <P> Standing on a low mound not far from the water's edge, Frank Robinson looked  Wednesday across the marshy expanse of Upper Newport Bay and smiled.  </P> <P> "It's a fabulous program," Robinson, a longtime crusader for preservation of  the bay, finally said. "It's going to make it that much harder for this  delicate setting ever to be destroyed."  </P> <P> Protecting the 752 acres of wildlife habitat in Upper Newport Bay has long been  a mission for Robinson and other county environmentalists. That's why they view  the area's inclusion in the newly created California Wildlands Program as a big  step forward.  </P> <P> To officially mark the beginning of the program in Southern California, state  and local officials, biologists and nature enthusiasts gathered Wednesday along  Back Bay Drive in Newport Beach for a brief ceremony. Upper Newport Bay is one  of nine areas in California, totaling 44,068 acres, included in the wild lands  program, which state Department of Fish and Game officials say is the first of  its kind in the country.  </P> <P> Historically, the department's budget for acquiring, maintaining and protecting  wild lands has been paid for almost entirely by the sales  </P> <P> of hunting and fishing licenses. The wild lands program is a bid to generate  millions of dollars in new revenue by charging, among others, bird-watchers,  hikers and wildlife photographers who are on nature tours $2 a day or $10 a  year to use the newly designated wild lands areas.  </P> <P> The program is projected to raise about $5 million for the department during  its first 2 years. That money will be used to staff each area with full-time  biologists as well as to maintain and protect the habitats. Access to each wild  lands area will be largely limited to hiking to reduce the impact on plant and  wildlife species.  </P> <P> "Our No. 1 priority is preservation of these areas, but to do that we'll need  to get non-hunters and (non-) fishermen to help bear that cost," state Fish and  Game spokesman Ted Thomas said. "About 85% of Californians don't fish or hunt,  but surveys and voting patterns indicate there is growing interest among state  residents to preserve open space and wild lands. We want to tap that interest."  </P> <P> Besides Upper Newport Bay, there will be two other areas in Southern California  in the wild lands program: The 5,000-acre Imperial Wildlife Area near the  Salton Sea and the 4,700-acre San Jacinto Wildlife Area in Riverside County.  </P> <P> The program at Upper Newport Bay will run differently from those in the other  eight areas in the state. Because Back Bay Drive already affords public access  to the refuge, only those who sign up for the agency's guided nature walks and  demonstrations will be assessed a fee.  </P> <P> Revenue from the statewide program will benefit efforts to expand and enhance  the Upper Newport Bay habitat. The most promising development is the possible  addition of 117 acres to the refuge, including 60 acres on the west side of the  bay, near Irvine Boulevard and University Drive, where a permanent nature  center would be built, in part with money from the wild lands program.  </P> <P> The 117 acres are owned by the Irvine Co., but in an agreement being drawn up  the company will give the property to the county in exchange for development  considerations elsewhere.  </P> <P> During the dedication ceremony Wednesday, County Board of Supervisors Chairman  Thomas F. Riley expressed hope that a final agreement on the land deal can be  reached this summer so the county and the Department of Fish and Game can begin  to plan the nature center.  </P> <P> The size of the facility and how to pay for it have not been worked out, but  Robinson said it will be large enough for local nature and environmental groups  to hold meetings.  </P> <P> "Many of us have long wanted such a facility to help validate the efforts of  those who have worked so hard to bring attention to this bay," said Robinson,  past president of Friends of Upper Newport Bay.  </P> <P> He has spent nearly 25 years on various projects to protect the bay and  believes that the area's inclusion in the wild lands program is an added  safeguard against urban encroachment into the habitat.  </P> <P> "For a long time, many of us were worried if we turned our back for a minute,  this would be gone," Robinson said. "But the Department of Fish and Game has in  a way institutionalized our cause, which adds another layer of protection."  </P> <P> Preservation of Upper Newport Bay was virtually assured in 1975, when state  officials bought the 752-acre reserve from the Irvine Co. for $3.4 million.  From August to April, it offers refuge to more than 200 species of birds.  </P></p>

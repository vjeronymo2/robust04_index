			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee pact must embody four principles, says US THE US will participate in a new International Coffee Agreement with economic clauses provided consensus is reached on four principles, the head of the US delegation to the International Coffee Organisation said at the beginning of a 5-day ICO council session in London yesterday, reports Reuter. The principles are a universal quota, market-orientation, an effective control system and the absence of 'infeasible market interventions', such as buffer stocks and retention schemes. 'On the other hand, if at the end of the week consensus does not exist, it is difficult for our delegation to envisage how further talks could be productive,' said Mr Myles Frechette. An ICO working group decided last week to recommend that negotiations begin for a new economic pact to replace the administrative accord that has operated since the collapse of the organisation's export quota system in July 1989. While supportive of a new economic pact, the US statement emphasised that the US would sign the agreement only if it met the concerns of the US industry and the US Congress. 'Even if we agree on these general principles, I need to re-emphasise that selling an agreement to our private sector and to our congress will be no easy task,' Mr Frechette said. The most delegates expect of this week's talks is that the council will draw up a timetable of meetings for negotiations, without negotiations actually beginning. Ms Dorothea Werneck, Brazil's National Economy Secretary said: 'We hope to have a schedule of meetings before the end of this week'. The only country to have reserved its position on quotas is Mexico, which is thought to be linking the ICO quota question to agreement on future free access to the US in the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement. Coffee prices moved higher in thin trading on the London Futures and Options Exchange yesterday, as traders awaited news from the ICO meeting. Traders shared delegates' reservations about the prospects for substantial progress being made towards a new price-supporting pact. The July futures position ended at Dollars 883 a tonne, up Dollars 14 from Friday's close, but Dollars 5 below the high attained during the day. The early rise was linked to Friday night's rally in the New York market.</p>

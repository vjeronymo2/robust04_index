Drivelling about "larger reforms", he blared that  he would make the New Year a "year of liquidating the corruption  and building a clean society" and charged the North with  "suspected nuclear development".    Dismissing his remarks as a foolish outcry of a doomed  mortal  forsaken by the times and the people, the news analyst says:    The "reforms" launched by the puppets are intended to build  up their "pro-government system" and consolidate the foundation  of their rule. What the "reforms" brought to the South Korean  people is, in fact, bloody sword brandishing and chronicle  poverty.    Now the South Korean people are waging an anti-"government"  struggle, saying that there is no need to watch the Kim Yong-sam  "regime" under the "civilian" veil any longer and they have  nothing to expect from it and that there is no alternative but  to overthrow it.    Such being the situation, who would believe the  advertisement  about "larger reforms".    The traitor Kim Yong-sam's provocation against the North  over  its "suspected nuclear development" is an act of one who has  lost a normal mode of thinking. It is needless to say that the  traitor is behaving recklessly, bereft of reason, urged by the  sinister intention to put a brake on the DPRK-U.S. talks at any  cost and stifle fellow countrymen through an "international  cooperation system", vexed at the progress of the talks.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam had better act with discretion,  mindful that his treacherous utterances at the beginning of the  year will only lead him more quickly to his grave.</p>

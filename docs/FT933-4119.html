			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Right backs off from a fight: How the Tory top brass is calling the tax tune THE DECISION yesterday by the cabinet's rightwing minority to drop a threatened revolt on taxation marks the beginning of a determined effort by Mr John Major, the prime minister, to end the drift and disunity of the past year. The climb-down underlined the weak position of the right wing in cabinet. It also highlighted the ability of the prime minister and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, backed by the loyal ranks of the spending ministers, to exert control if they wish. For this purpose, the cabinet right means Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, Mr Peter Lilley, health secretary, and, less committed, Mr Michael Howard, home secretary - the trio generally identified as the 'bastards' referred to in unguarded comments by Mr Major earlier this year. However, while the issue is probably dead at cabinet level, continued unease among rightwing backbenchers suggests that it remains a potentially important focal point for dissent. Rightwingers were dismayed by Mr Clarke's comments which kept open the option of tax increases in the November Budget while ruling out any further cuts in public spending. One of Mr Major's strongest critics on the back benches is Mrs Teresa Gorman, who has said that an increase in taxes would be 'a reversal of everything we have stood for over the past decade or more'. Others on the right wing making similar comments included Mr John Townend, chairman of the Conservative backbench finance committee, and Sir George Gardiner, a member of the executive of the 1922 Committee, which represents all Tory backbenchers. However, while taxation will continue to irritate relations between Mr Major and the right wing, the debate is not simply a continuation of the Maastricht rebellion by other means. For one thing, there is little overlap between the the small group of rightwingers which has orchestrated the debate on taxation and the 23 hard-line Euro-sceptics who helped defeat the government in the social chapter debate in July. Of the half-dozen leading backbench taxation rebels, only Sir George Gardiner and Mrs Gorman were among the die-hard 23. The others - Mr Townend, Mr David Shaw and Sir Rhodes Boyson - voted with the government. Most of the remaining Maastricht rebels have yet to declare their views on the Budget options. But there is no reason to assume that all would join a taxation rebellion. Some, like Mr Tony Marlow, Mr Richard Shepherd and Mr Nicholas Winterton - who fell into line at the last minute on Maastricht - have virtually detached themselves from the parliamentary party and are capable of opposing almost any government policy. Others, however, have been more discriminating in their criticism of the government. For example, Mr Bill Cash, leader of the Maastricht rebellion, has been loyal to the government except on Europe and pit closures. Further complicating the picture, the right wing is split internally about the balance of importance between low taxation and sound public finances, which might require tax increases. Some rightwingers point to Lord Howe's tax-raising budget of 1981, which laid the groundwork for the prosperity of the later 1980s, as a courageous Conservative Budget which the chancellor would do well to study. Mr John Biffen, a former leader of the Commons under Lady Thatcher and the leading rightwing proponent of this view, has suggested that the top rate of tax may have to rise considerably to help eliminate the Pounds 50bn budget deficit. Mr Biffen was a trenchant critic of the Maastricht bill, although he voted with the government in the final series of debates which eventually decided the issue. Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has been more opaque. He would like to avoid tax increases but, like Mr Biffen, he believes that the first priority is sound public finances. There is one further important difference between the Maastricht rebellion and the taxation debate. The Maastricht rebels' objective was to force the government to abandon the treaty by forcing a vote on including the social chapter - anathema to Conservatives. Throughout the long wrangle on the bill to approve the treaty, the rebels knew that there was no risk of bringing down the government. So when Mr Major called their bluff by tabling a confidence motion, they fell into line. However, the Budget is a different matter. The right wing's only chance to reverse tax increases would be to oppose the enabling legislation in the finance bill. That would mean defeating the government on a key issue of policy, and possibly wrecking the chancellor's spending and revenue calculations. At this stage it seems highly unlikely that a significant number of rebels would be prepared to go to such lengths to make their point.</p>

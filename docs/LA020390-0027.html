			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRUE GRAFT IN THE STATEHOUSE  </P> <P> Corruption has been hanging over California's capitol for years. Now it's  official: true graft in the Statehouse. State Sen. Joseph Montoya stands  convicted on five federal criminal counts of extortion, one of racketeering and  one of money laundering. And Montoya's is not necessarily an isolated case.  More prosecutions could follow from the elaborate FBI sting operation that has  been under way for several years.  </P> <P> There is not much that could make the Legislature's reputation among voters  worse than it is. But the conviction of the Whittier Democrat is certain to  further deepen the public distrust of lawmakers. And sadly, such feelings spill  over onto the reputations of the many legislators who work hard in the public's  behalf and seek no special rewards for themselves.  </P> <P> Legislative leaders must now move with alacrity to enact the toughest possible  ethics law, which will implement a reform measure already on the June election  ballot. There must be no loopholes that opponents can use to raise further  suspicion in the minds of voters that somehow lawmakers will find a way to reap  unearned personal benefits from their public service. Then, the Legislature  should set to work on a campaign-finance law that will end all possibility of  the sort of contribution shakedown that was outlined by the evidence in the  Montoya trial.  </P> <P> As for Montoya himself, the Senate leadership should at least strip him of his  committee chairmanship immediately. Then, should Montoya refuse to resign, the  leaders should initiate action at the appropriate time to expel him from the  Senate.  </P> <P> For too long, Sacramento has behaved as if this whole nasty mess would just go  away and legislators could get back to business as usual. The shock of the  conviction should convince them that the voters will stand for no less -- and  deserve no less -- than a thorough housecleaning.  </P></p>

[Kovacsova] How do you view the status of the small  democratic countries in Central Europe at a time when a new  strategic balance is being sought on the U.S.-Russia-NATO level?  Is there any future for a joint course of action by these small  countries?    [Goncz] Economic and political integration, as well as  integration in the security policy sphere, is not only in the  common interest of the Central European countries, but is also  in the interest of West Europe. This contributes to stability in  the region. We are aware that all four states are coping with  more or less the same problems in the economic and, to a certain  extent, social spheres. Integration could alleviate the  negative impact of transformation.    It is also important for our states to infiltrate West  European markets, something that is becoming more and more  difficult due to the current economic recession affecting our  partners there. If we are successful in this, we can reckon with  the modernization and development of our own economies. In my  opinion, this would also improve our market's importing  capability.    The Visegrad Four states together represent a  100-million-strong, demanding, and unsaturated market. We are  situated conveniently close to West Europe. We can also  participate in developing partnership relations between other  states in Central, East, and West Europe.    Cooperation among our four states is always more  advantageous  than an individual course of action. We have countless  opportunities for mutual integration. Despite the different  geographic location of the individual countries, the region  forms a coherent unit. A community involving the Visegrad Four  states is far more attractive for the West than each state is  individually.    When integrating with Europe, it is unnecessary to proceed  in  the same way and enter into the organizations there at the same  time. We tried this before, and I would prefer not to talk about  the outcome. We face similar tasks in the integration  processes, but we are at various stages of development, whether  this involves legislation, economic relations, or national  security policies. We are also keen on cooperation in human  rights issues, environmental protection, and guaranteeing social  stability. The essence lies in not formalizing our relations,  but in keeping each other informed and -- where possible -- in  coordinating our points of view together and bilaterally and not  throwing spanners in each others works.    I am always glad if Prague succeeds in doing something first  and I would be pleased if Prague were to express its pleasure at  something we succeed in first.    [Kovacsova] We would be interested in hearing Hungary's  point of view regarding the United States and Russia and also  regarding relations between the Hungarians and the Americans and  between the Hungarians and the Russians in the political,  cultural, economic, or other spheres.    [Goncz] Apart from the United States and Russia, Germany is  no less an important partner for Hungary. In my opinion, it  will be important to forge close economic ties in parallel with  all three of the aforementioned states. To date, U.S.  investments in Hungary amount to around $3 billion. Influential  American-Hungarians, who play a similar role in cultural  relations with the United States, have been of assistance in the  influx of U.S. capital. There are numerous experts of Hungarian  origin at U.S. universities who can partially influence public  opinion and ferment ideas together.    Germany is an important and traditional economic partner and  it is -- as it is to you -- favorably inclined toward us. This  stems from German knowledge of the conditions in our region.    As far as our relationship with Russia is concerned, since  the last Soviet soldier withdrew from our country, there have  been no obstacles preventing the formation of friendly -- I  emphasize friendly -- relations. Our political contacts are  perfect. I have met three times with President Yeltsin and our  meetings have always led to specific and matter-of-fact  agreements.    Although our foreign trade with Russia now only amounts to  20-25 percent of its former volume, this country is still a  vitally important trading partner for us. It purchases  agricultural products, including apples and wine, from northern  Hungary; Russia is one of the largest importers of wheat,  medical supplies, and Ikarus buses. Therefore, it is in  Hungary's interest to ensure not only that the Russian market is  open but also that it is sufficiently solvent.    Undoubtedly, it is in Hungary's crucial interest to ensure  that the democratization process in Russia is not halted. We  are keen for the United States to assist and support this  process. We have the same view regarding Russia's incorporation  into the system of European cooperation and organizations.    [Kovacsova] Regarding European security, what is your  country's stance toward the Balladur plan, a plan aimed at  greater stability?    [Goncz] The plan appeals to me very much. I think it can be  further adapted. I consider the goal to improve this region's  internal stability to be extraordinarily important. The issue  of ethnic minorities -- one of the priorities of Hungarian  foreign policy -- is of particular concern to us.    Hungary is not striving for unilateral advantages for the  Hungarian minorities, but for all the minorities living in the  states in our region, which is like an ethnic mosaic. Ethnic  minorities are a problem for every state and, therefore, we have  to seek standard principles and a common denominator that would  define equal commitments.    Ethnic Hungarians have been living since 1920 in more states  under various circumstances and have different experiences.  Such minorities always bear a dual responsibility. They should  assist the overall development of the majority state where they  will enjoy success only if they are loyal to it. However, they  also have moral ties to their own community and to their mother  state with which they have cultural and linguistic links. The  two states involved can always assist in this. This reasoning  is purely positive, and is definitely not directed against  anyone. Implementing it could help a great deal in the interest  of an internal settlement for this region. That is, at least  until the common borders are absolutely permeable.    [Kovacsova] In your opinion, in what way could mutual  relations between Hungary and Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech  Republic, or Hungary and Poland change following the Prague  meeting with President Clinton?    [Goncz] At the moment, we do not know exactly what the talks  on 12 January will concern, because we do not know the  conclusions to be reached at the NATO summit from where  President Clinton will travel to Prague. Afterwards, he will  hold talks in Russia.    Independently of this, it is important for the Visegrad Four  states to consider the development of their economic relations.  We have a free trade zone agreement. This is an important plus.    The problem is that the Visegrad Four states have virtually  the same deformed economic structure. I think, however, that it  is possible to find together the means of expanding mutual  trade. It is pointless to compete with each other on third  markets.    I attach no less importance to a systematic exchange of  political information and to coordination. We could quite  easily slip up without them. We do not have conflicting  interests, our friendship has not been impaired by anything, and  our cultural traditions and ways of thinking are similar. We  also speak the same language politically and the development in  our societies is identical.    It is essential to expand and intensify regional cooperation  and I emphasize that we will get by without establishing  administrative structures. If the need arises, the foreign  ministers, the prime ministers, and even the heads of state can  contact each other for a personal exchange of views. If a  certain issue becomes acute or if a difficulty crops up in the  system of relations, it is sometimes enough merely to life the  telephone.    [Kovacsova] What kind of role could the endeavor to become a  full-fledged partner for the advanced parts of Europe and the  United States play for our region?    [Goncz] Our integration with Europe will be considered at  the end of the century. I think it could be sooner. Perhaps  not for all of us at the same time. It could happen that we  will dispatch the Czech Republic as our avantgarde. Or, it will  send us into Europe as a vanguard. Whoever is first will  reserve a place for the second. It is essential that he does  not slam the door in the other's face.    We perceive the significance of Euro-Atlantic cooperation as  our incorporation into the European security system on a  pancontinental scale. At the moment, I cannot say what role the  reformed NATO and the Western European Union will play and I  cannot say at what pace we will proceed in modernizing our  economies. I consider these three elements to be the most  important, while I reckon that they can be intensified at a  different pace.    I propose that we think about which of them we want to  cooperate in and how, even without written treaties.    After all, we are one family. If we do not realize this,  then we are real dimwits.</p>

The  nuclear reactor China sold to Pakistan, he said, went into  operation on 1 August last year. Since then the reactor has run  satisfactorily. The two parties are now holding discussions  about installing a second nuclear power generating unit which  will provide 300,000 kw of electricity.    Jiang continued: China has signed contracts with Iran to  sell the latter two 300,000 kw nuclear power generating units.  The reactor China exported to Algeria for research purposes has  now completed full power operations [shi xian man gong lu yun  xing 1395 3807 3341 0501 3764 6663 5887] and will finally pass  its acceptance test. Work to install the nuclear power  generating units in Iran is expected to begin this year.</p>

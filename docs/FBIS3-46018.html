Rybkin won 223 votes from the 416 members of the State Duma  in this morning's voting. Twenty-eight members abstained.    Rybkin told the press that he would try to cooperate with  the  president and the government according to the Constitution, and  set up a "partner's relationship" with the upper house, or  Federation Council.    He said he would also work hard to maintain coordination  among all members and groups of the lower house by taking into  account the interests of all, including the smaller contingents.    Rybkin, who holds a degree in engineering, was once a  Communist Party secretary in a Volgagrad District. He was  elected people's deputy in the Russia Federation Parliament of  the former Soviet Union, and had been the leader of the Russian  Communist Party parliamentary group in the Russia Federation.    He later became a member of the Russian Agrarian Party,  which  nominated him for parliament following the legislative election  last December.</p>

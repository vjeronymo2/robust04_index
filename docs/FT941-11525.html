			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Romania goes to extremes Romania's ruling Party of Social Democracy said yesterday it had agreed on a coalition with the hardline Romanian National Unity party to include other extreme nationalist and former communist parties. The left-wing PSDR, which formed a minority government after winning elections in September 1992, said it hoped to conclude negotiations for the new multi-party coalition by March 1. Pro-reform opposition parties said the move would have a disastrous affect on Romania's image abroad and that economic reform would remain at a standstill. The two parties said they aimed to include the Socialist Labour party, the self-proclaimed heir to the Romanian Communist party, and the Greater Romania party, an openly anti-Semitic group, in the new coalition in order to reach a parliamentary majority after a close-run no-confidence vote in December.</p>

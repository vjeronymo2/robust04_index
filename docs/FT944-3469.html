			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / MAM guards its independence SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley are discussing arrangements which would maintain their fund management arms as two separate companies even if a merger between the two investment banks goes ahead. Top officials of the two fund management companies are understood to be meeting today to discuss the structure. A merger between Warburg's 75 per cent-owned asset management company, Mercury Asset Management, and Morgan Stanley Asset Management had been part of the deal's rationale. It is thought that there have been concerns within MAM about the possible loss of autonomy. Currently, MAM has its own board and its own executive committee. Although Mr Hugh Stevenson, MAM chairman, would probably join the board of the combined Warburg/Morgan Stanley group, it remains unclear how MAM would maintain its independence. 'They have more power as two separate entities,' said one official involved in the talks. 'As time goes by, we may decide to merge,' the official said, adding that the senior managements of both firms preferred to see how an association worked before seeking full integration. It is understood that talks have been going on between the two fund management arms for about a month and that senior officials on both sides would prefer to keep the organisations separate. Several MAM clients, who are also shareholders, said maintaining MAM's independence was a primary concern. 'I would like to see that they are not wholly owned by this company,' said one. 'If they are not operationally independent, all sorts of problems could come up.' Maintaining MAM as a separate shareholder would ease the pressure on Warburg and Morgan Stanley to make an offer to the holders of the 25 per cent of the company Warburg does not already own. It is understood that Morgan Stanley would prefer that a minority 'rump' Warburg did not continue for a long period of time. Lex, Page 20; Background, Page 22</p>

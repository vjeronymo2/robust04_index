			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / US urges truce to create jobs: Washington says no country has found 'right approach' to labour market Washington is calling for a US-European truce to the conflict over which country has the right policies for creating jobs. The US should invest more in education and training, while European countries reform inflexible labour policies and wage-setting restrictions. This is the central argument of a paper, mainly written by Mr Robert Reich, the US labour secretary, circulated to Group of Seven governments before next week's jobs summit in Detroit. Although the UK government claimed yesterday its deregulatory approach should be a model for other countries, the US paper says 'no country has yet found the right approach to adjusting and succeeding in the new world economy'. It also emphasises that labour market reform is not a substitute for creating economic demand. 'Countries that pursue structural improvements without taking steps to increase aggregate demand will see little or no return for their efforts.' This reflects continuing US irritation with the refusal of other G7 countries to adopt more expansionary policies. The paper says a typical developed country with an annual gain in productivity of 1.5 per cent and labour force expansion of 0.5 per cent must have economic growth at a real rate of more than 2 per cent a year just to hold unemployment constant. It says that over the past two decades Europe has experienced substantial real wage growth but stagnant employment. In contrast America has experienced buoyant private sector employment but with growing wage differentials and declining real pay for less-educated workers. It adds that the main labour market problem in G7 countries is a shift in demand from less-educated workers towards workers with problem-solving skills. But compared with changes in technology, it argues that expanding trade with lower-cost countries has had only a modest role in this shift. 'Increased globalisation and technological change have raised the knowledge content of goods in which G7 nations have a comparative advantage. If properly managed this shift in demand can lead to rapidly growing economies that produce high-wage, high-skill jobs.' The paper concludes: 'All G7 countries need to think about improvements in policies to facilitate transitions from school to work, work to work, and unemployment to work. All G7 countries need to maintain a commitment to an open world trading system, but competition should be based on investments in quality and innovation with workers viewed as assets to be invested in and not just costs to be minimised'. Some in the US have argued their country has little to learn about employment policy from Europe, with its higher unemployment rates, but the Clinton administration believes it can benefit from European lessons.</p>

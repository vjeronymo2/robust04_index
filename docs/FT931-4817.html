			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: EMS currencies stronger THE D-Mark continued to come under pressure yesterday, weakened by expectations of further German rate cuts, writes Emma Tucker. The fall in the currency followed the Bundesbank's decision to lower the interest rate on its 14-day repo on Friday. This enabled other European Monetary System currencies to maintain stronger positions, with the French franc, peseta, lira and pound benefiting in particular. Profit-taking on the dollar was the other main feature of foreign exchange trading in Europe yesterday. After the ebullience that greeted Friday's excellent US non-farm payroll figures, the dollar eased slightly as investors calmed down ahead of this week's economic data, expected to reflect more modest growth. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America in London, said: 'The market is coming back to reality. Although there are genuine signs that the US economy is growing, there has been nothing else in terms of data so far to suggest that it is growing at the rate indicated by last week's payroll figures.' Although underlying sentiment towards the US currency remains bullish, it closed about  1/2 pfennig down in London at DM1.6625. It rallied slightly in New York to end at DM1.6635. Among EMS currencies, the Spanish peseta advanced steadily against the D-Mark. Dealers said widespread expectations of a cut in Germany's officially posted rates on March 18 was helping to calm fears that the Bank of Spain would be forced to prop up the peseta at current levels. It finished at Pta71.08 to the D-Mark, compared with Friday's close of Pta71.37. Sterling was mildly weaker than on Friday, but managed to stay above DM2.40 for most of the day. Mr Hawkins commented that encouraging credit business figures helped the pound maintain its level. 'A lot of the talk about the UK recovery has been anecdotal. At the moment the rise in credit is one of the few hard pieces of data suggesting that the upturn in demand is sustainable,' he said. According to analysts, reservations about sterling still abound, but they are mainly political. There was some nervousness yesterday about a possible government defeat over Maastricht. However, sentiment is generally more favourable. Analysts at Bank of America are forecasting a rise in the pound to DM2.60 towards the end of the year. The yen was expected to weaken yesterday after the latest Bank of Japan tankan survey showed corporate confidence to be very gloomy. But dealers reported a big move back into the Japanese currency in the afternoon. One commented that although the domestic fundamentals behind the yen looked poor, the market was focusing on Japan's strong trade surplus. The yen ended in London at Y116.6 per dollar, having risen from Friday's Y117.6.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, June 21 (ATA) -- The Presidency of the  Republican Party [PR] of Albania received the visiting  delegation of the European Democratic Union yesterday, according  to the spokesman of the PR party. Geoffrey Pattie, head of the  delegation, said in the meeting that "Albania is a significant  country for the European Democratic Union" adding "we like to  come here to follow the development of the democratic process."  Later he expressed interest in the vision of the Republican  Party of Albania on this question.    Fatmir Veliu, deputy chairman of the Republican Party,  underlined that the Republican Party has made and continues to  make all efforts to strengthen the democratic right wing against  social communist threat. Only a total engagement of the  Albanian political right wing forces, he said, can uproot  communism and cleanse the state administration form its  collaborators. The Republican Party, Mr. Veliu said further on,  has energetically rejected the latest decision of the parliament  on compensating the site with vouchers supporting the view that  the real value of the land can be defined only with the  realisation of the real bargain market, which is attained with  the restitution of property to their owners.    Mr. Geoffrey Pattie, on behalf of the European Democratic  Union thanked those present for their briefing and said that the  Republican Party makes up an increasing tendency for the  Albanian public. He also gave explanations about the  documentation and ways to be followed for the Republican Party's  membership to the European Democratic Union.    On the same day, Mr. Pattie held a meeting with Albanian  reporters during which views were exchanged about the Albanian  mass media, the role it plays during the present democratic  developments in Albania and about the application of the Law of  the Press, recently approved by the majority of the Albanian  reporters. The participants in the meeting also spoke of the  freedoms and rights as well as of the difficulties the Albanian  reporters are faced with today.</p>

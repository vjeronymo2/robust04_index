			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Wheel turns full circle for Deng protege: The elevation of once-disgraced reformer Zhu Rongji to the politburo NO ONE knows better the capricious turns of the wheel of fortune than Zhu Rongji, the man in charge of China's industry, who yesterday was vaulted on to the standing committee of the Communist party's politburo, its most powerful council. From his new position of power - Zhu is fifth in the leadership - he is expected to be the driving force behind the implementation of the party's policies towards further economic liberalisation. In his quiet moments, however, he may ruefully reflect that Deng Xiaoping, 88, has been both his nemesis and greatest patron. Like many talented young intellectuals in the 1950s, Zhu, now 64, took Mao Zedong at his word when he called upon the nation to criticise the Communist party under the rubric 'Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend'. He was not aware that this was a ruse; what Mao intended was to root out sources of opposition to his peculiar brand of idealistic and autarkic communism. When the Great Helmsman launched his 'anti-rightist campaign' in 1957 he placed Deng in charge. Deng, ever the efficient one, rooted out hundreds of thousands of intellectuals who were removed from their jobs in the party and government. The brain of China was lobotomised. From 1957 until his 'rehabilitation' in 1979, Zhu worked in Beijing in planning and economic ministries. By the early 1980s he was on the move, rising to the deputy director's position of the State Planning Commission and lecturing in economics. Deng also watched his progress and in 1987 Zhu was appointed mayor of Shanghai, succeeding Jiang Zemin, the current secretary-general of the party. In 1989, when students rioted in Shanghai, Zhu was able to restore order without resort to the military. Until a day ago Zhu was not even a full member of the central committee, just an alternate, let alone on the politburo. But under the patronage of Deng, the man who exiled him for 20 years, Zhu's rise has been extraordinary. Recently he was placed in charge of the cabinet's economic and trade office from which he will have the largest say in China's economic policy. He is solidly pro-economic reform and his elevation to the top group in the Communist party has been taken as positive sign that China's elderly leadership has been prepared to back up the rhetoric of the last week with people capable of making it happen. Zhu is one of three new members of the Politburo standing committee. The other two, Hu Jintao, 49, and General Liu Huaqing, 76, are both seen as reform-minded communists. Hu, the former party secretary in Tibet, is the protege of Hu Yaobang, Deng's first chosen successor who fell from grace in 1986. General Liu, a veteran of the Long March and the man responsible for modernising China's navy, is a close associate of Deng and fought with him during the civil war against the Nationalists in the late 1940s. They join Li Ruihuan, 58, a reformer and liberal-minded propaganda chief, and Qiao Shi, 68, head of state security. Qiao is thought to be a moderate in economic reform terms. He is also a survivor. He argued against the use of force in June 1989 but not enough for his loyalty to be questioned. When force was used he was in the forefront of those justifying the action taken. The party has increased the number of people in the politburo from 14 to 20, with two alternates. Most are professionals and most are seen by Beijing analysts as pro-economic reformers. The party bosses of Guangdong, Shandong, Tianjin, and Shanghai were all elevated to the politburo. The only hardliner of note to be appointed was the mayor of Beijing. The representation of the provinces and big cities is significant for two reasons. First, these are the areas of China which have best taken to reform; their leaders also have a keen sense of what plays well among the people. Second, the Beijing leadership has wanted them in the inner sanctum to make sure they do not stray too far from party orthodoxy. The 'centre', as Beijing is known, has had difficultly controlling the provinces and the appointments of senior provincial leaders may serve that purpose. But if the new appointments to the politburo suggest a victory for Deng and his programme of economic reform, there is little evidence that the party has any interest in embracing political reform. Li Ruihuan may lift the leaden hand of the state from some cultural activities, but the party is keenly aware that economic reform could also pose political and social problems. Of the full members of the committee, about 22 per cent are from the military; when alternates are included, the figure drops to about 20 per cent. For the past 15 years the military's representation in the central committee has been on the decline, falling to 19 per cent in 1987. Although this year's rise seems slight, analysts in Beijing said plans to liberalise the economy further meant the party wanted to make sure of the military's allegiance.</p>

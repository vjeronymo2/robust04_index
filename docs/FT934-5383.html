			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Tring postpones planned flotation Tring International, the budget price compact disc company, said yesterday that it had postponed its planned flotation because of the weakness of the new issue market. The flotation, which had been scheduled for next month, would now take place in the first quarter of next year, the company said. Tring said the decision was not the result of legal action it faced for allegedly selling unauthorised recordings of Olivia Newton John, Cat Stevens, Bob Marley and other artists. Record companies PolyGram, EMI Records and MCA have served writs on Tring. 'The timetable has most definitely and categorically not changed because of the litigation,' the company said. Tring says the legal actions will not have a material effect on its profits, which were Pounds 3.3m pre-tax last year. It adds that it always pays royalties to the companies it believes hold the copyrights and withdraws music from sale if complaints are made. Tring announced last month that Mr Alan Wheatley, former chairman of venture capital group 3i, had agreed to become chairman. Mr Wheatley has not yet formally taken up the position, however, and is not yet a director of the company. It is understood that he will make a decision on whether to become chairman of Tring at the time of flotation, depending on his other commitments. Mr Tony Morris, a former vice president of PolyGram International, has already taken up his position as Tring's deputy chairman. Tring said that sales in October had been at a record level and it appeared that November had also been a successful month. There was no pressure on it to go for a quick flotation. 'We're a very successful company with masses of cash. There's no need to raise cash to pay off huge debts.'</p>

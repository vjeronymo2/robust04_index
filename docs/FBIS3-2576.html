			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] Carrying with them the expectations of people of  all nationalities in Tibet, Tibet's deputies to the second  session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] and  representatives to the second session of the Eighth Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National  Committee left Lhasa by special plane this morning for Beijing  for the meetings.    To do a good job in presenting the Tibet people's requests,  suggestions, and expectations at the meetings, the deputies and  representatives visited grass-roots units and their constituents  to familiarize themselves with Tibet's economic reform as well  as its cultural and educational development and the state of  public health, agriculture, and animal husbandry. They also  extensively solicited views of cadres and masses in various  sectors; heard a report given by the regional people's  government about Tibet's economic affairs in 1993 and reform  projects for 1994; and discussed many ideas and suggestions with  regard to Tibet's reform, opening up, and economic, spiritual,  democratic, and legislative construction. They pledged that  they would never disappoint the people in Tibet and will convey  their high expectations to the Beijing meetings.    The deputies and representatives were seen off at the  airport  by leaders of Tibet and relevant departments.</p>

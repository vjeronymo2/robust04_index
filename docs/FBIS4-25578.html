			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chan Wai-fong] </F>   [Text] Government officials, government-sanctioned labour  unions, and bosses of sweatshop factories are shielding one  another in the exploitation of Chinese workers, an article  carried by a mimeographed underground newsletter distributed in  Shenzhen alleges. The only answer to protect workers' rights and  interests was an independent workers' union free from government  and party control, it said.    The newsletter, Workers' Square, was put out by a group of  labour activists trying to organise workers in the Shenzhen  Special Economic Zone. Three of the activists Li Wenmin, Kuang  Lezhuang, and Liu Hutang were reportedly arrested last month in  Shenzhen. Although their arrests have been reported in the Hong  Kong press, the Shenzhen Government and public security  authorities refused to confirm them. But a source said the  activists had been followed and were under police surveillance  since early this year. Despite the strong pressure, the  activists managed to put out three issues of the Workers' Square  before they were arrested, the source said.    According to copies of the Workers' Square obtained by the  SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST, the activists held that only when  united could workers fight against exploitation, and they could  no longer rely on the official unions to protect their interests.    The first issue of the publication blasted authorities for  allowing sweatshop factory bosses to ignore safety regulations.  One of the most appalling cases was a fire that killed 84  workers in a toy factory in Shenzhen last November. "Employers,  unions and government officials have been shielding one another.  They ignore regulations, abuse the lawful rights of workers and  humiliate workers' dignity. China is a signatory of the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights," the article says. "It  is a member of the International Labour Organisation and has  promulgated a large number of labour laws. But why do so many  of our wishes remain mere illusion even until today? Why are we  still alone in disputes?" the article asks. "The answer is that  we haven't united." Another article cited a dispute in a  garment factory in September last year, saying that government  labour authorities had failed in looking after the interests of  workers. There were articles and verses on the misery of  workers in sweatshop factories.    "The improvement of working environments, improvement of  living conditions, shortening of hours and increase of wages  will not be bestowed on us," an article said. "It's something  we must fight for. If we unite, we will become a strong force."    The editors of Workers' Square said that a publication by  workers and for workers was the first step to fight  exploitation. It was a forum to expose "crimes committed by  capitalists".</p>

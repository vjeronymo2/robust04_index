			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aydyn Mekhtiyev in the "Azerbaijan" column: </F> "Heydar Aliyev Has Found Himself in a Difficult Situation.  What Is the Fate of the Moscow Plan for a Karabakh Settlement?"]    [Text] The unexpected finale of the two-day negotiations  in Moscow between the defense chiefs of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and  Nagorno-Karabakh with the Russian Federation Defense Ministry's  mediation has given rise to various forecasts about the future  of the Russian peace plan. Some tend to believe that the  refusal by the Azerbaijan delegation to sign the final protocol  means nothing but yet another failure of the talks, while others  predict confidently that Baku at any moment will accede to the  document, which has already been signed by the Armenian side.    The conflicting statements by the negotiating parties also  fail to clear up the situation that has emerged. Thus,  Col.-Gen. Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian Federation deputy defense  minister, said that Azerbaijan Defense Minister Mamedrafi  Mamedov had no authority to sign the protocol, although Mamedov  himself does not think so. "I had full authority to sign the  final protocol," he stated, "but I did not do so only because  some questions called for additional study." The minister  nonetheless did not specify which of the protocol provisions  appeared dubious to the Azerbaijan military.    As NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent was advised by an  informed source, overnight on 17 May Mamedrafi Mamedov had a  lengthy telephone conversation with Azerbaijan President Heydar  Aliyev who ordered him urgently to return to Baku for a detailed  discussion of the possible implications of signing the Moscow  protocol. The piquancy of the situation is that a day before,  on 16 May, Mamedov gave no indication that he might not sign the  final document. This prompted Russian Defense Minister Grachev  to announce that Moscow's plan was fully approved by the sides.    The somewhat strange behavior by the Azerbaijan defense  department chief can be apparently attributed to the fact that  the negotiations in Moscow took place amid a sharp aggravation  of the internal political situation in Azerbaijan. Nearly all  political forces in opposition to the present powers charged  Parliament Speaker Rasul Guliyev, who had earlier signed the  Bishkek protocol, with high treason and demanded an urgent  convocation of a parliament (milli mejlis) session. Last  Saturday Rasul Guliyev, appearing on national television,  sharply criticized the opposition and warned it against any  attempts to destabilize the situation in the country. The  parliament speaker's position however was exacerbated by the  fact that disapproving assessments of his performance were also  made within the presidential team itself.    According to information obtained by NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's  correspondent from confidential sources, some influential people  who shape the republic's foreign policy told the president that  the parliament speaker had exceeded his powers by signing the  Bishkek protocol. Furthermore, they warned President Aliyev  that they might resign in the event that Defense Minister  Mamedrafi Mamedov signed the Moscow protocol on 17 May, giving  the "go ahead" to the introduction of Russian troops into  Azerbaijan.    Therefore Heydar Aliyev has been confronted with a complex  dilemma: Either to ignore the warnings from a number of his  close associates over the possible negative effects of signing  the Moscow protocol or to opt for a stalling tactic in order to  make a final choice. As can be seen, the president has chosen  the second. He had to postpone indefinitely his official visit  to Georgia's capital which was to have begun on 17 May. In the  past few days the president has been holding tense consultations  with members of his team and also trying to reconcile the  supporters and opponents of the Moscow protocol. The division  in the presidential team over the upcoming introduction of  Russian troops to Azerbaijan is indirectly confirmed by the  admission of President Aliyev's adviser that "neither the  president nor the foreign minister has seen the document now  being discussed in Moscow" and therefore there can be no  question about a speedy signing of the Moscow protocol.    An informed source in the republic's Foreign Affairs  Ministry  stressed that Azerbaijan's foreign policy department does not  support the position of the defense minister and the parliament  speaker who advocate the signing of the Moscow protocol. The  Foreign Affairs Ministry leadership is trying to convince Aliyev  that the peace-keeping forces should be introduced into the  conflict area only within the CSCE framework. "It is not known  just how Russian generals will behave in the absence of  oversight by international observers over the actions of Russian  troops in the region," a source in the Foreign Affairs Ministry  told NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent.    Vladimir Kazimirov, the Russian Federation president's  special envoy who arrived in Baku, has been trying in the past  few days to persuade President Aliyev to support the position of  Azerbaijan's parliament and Defense Ministry leadership on the  issue of accession to the 17 May Moscow protocol. At the same  time the National Assembly met in session on the morning of 18  May in Baku, where demands were heard to annul Azerbaijan's  signature under the Bishkek protocol and to prevent the signing  of the Moscow protocol. As NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA was going to  press it was not yet known which decision was made.</p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Observer: Bankers' lore It's hard to better a banker when it comes to putting a cheerful gloss on bad news. Hence yesterday's press release from Nomura, announcing 50 job losses, was headed 'Nomura makes strategic adjustments'. Someone answering to the name Kafka was handling the matter. Meanwhile, a colleague has just received the following letter from his NatWest bank manager: 'The Bank has recently completed a study of its representation locally with a view to improving the quality of service offered to all its customers in Bexleyheath. As a result, it has been decided to close this branch on November 13 and merge the business with our Bexleyheath Clock Tower branch. . .'</p>

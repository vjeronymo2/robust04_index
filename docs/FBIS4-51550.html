			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- Kan Kato, head of the  government's tax reform panel, said Tuesday [26 April] the  group's basic stance on tax system reforms remains unchanged  despite the Social Democratic Party's break from the ruling  coalition.    Kato told a news conference after the panel's plenary  session  the tax commission is resolved to realize tax reforms centering  on a boost of indirect taxes.    The policy was agreed on when the coalition government was  formed last August, he said.    Taking the country's future into consideration, tax reform  must be carried out regardless of which government comes into  power, he said.    Kato said reform is also Japan's international obligation  and  the commission is required to work out a proposal by the end of  June, in time for the July summit of major industrialized  nations in Naples.    The body will coordinate its stance with other councils  concerned with administrative reforms, leading to cuts in  government expenditures, he said.    Kato expressed hope the SDP will support the proposed tax  system reforms.</p>
